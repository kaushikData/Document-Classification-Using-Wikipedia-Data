'''Giacomo Costa''' (14 December 1919 – 22 January 2000) was an [[Italian Australians|Italian Australian]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by his [[ring name]], '''Al Costello.''' Costello was the first professional wrestler to be nicknamed "The Man of a Thousand Holds" because of his innovative and very technical style.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

Costello was the creator and original member of the [[tag team]] '''[[The Fabulous Kangaroos]]''', whose "Ultra Australian" [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]] complete with [[boomerang]]s, [[Slouch hat|bush hats]] and the song "[[Waltzing Matilda]]" as their entrance music, existed in various forms from 1957 until 1983. Costello was either an active wrestler, or a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] in all versions of The Fabulous Kangaroos.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; He and [[Roy Heffernan]] are arguably the most famous version of The Kangaroos,&lt;ref name="TagIntro"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005 | chapter= Introduction | pages= 1–16 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as one of the top tag teams to ever compete in professional wrestling,&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TopTenTeams"&gt;{{cite book | author= Conner, Floyd | title=Wrestling's Most Wanted : The Top 10 Book of Pro Wrestling's Outrageous Performers, Punishing Piledrivers, and Other Oddities | publisher=Potomac Books | date =12 February 2001 | chapter= Terrific Tag Teams | pages= 166 | isbn=978-1-57488-308-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often credited with popularizing tag team wrestling in the late 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="TagIntro"/&gt;

Costello later formed other versions of The Fabulous Kangaroos with Ray St. Clair, [[Don Kent (wrestler)|Don Kent]] and Tony Charles. He also managed the team of Don Kent &amp; [[Bruno Bekkar]] and later on "Johnny Heffernan" under The Fabulous Kangaroos name.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

Costello officially retired from wrestling in 1983 but still made a few brief returns to the ring after that.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.1wrestlinglegends.com/column/guest-14.htm| title = Al Costello, "THE" Fabulous Kangaroos | accessdate= 5 August 2007 | author = Siler, Bob | publisher= 1Wrestlinglegends.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928122104/http://www.1wrestlinglegends.com/column/guest-14.htm |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he managed [[The Fabulous Kangaroos#New Fabulous Kangaroos|The New Fabulous Kangaroos]] (Denny Kass and [[Al Snow]]) before retiring completely from the wrestling business.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; Both Costello and his tag team partner Heffernan died before Kangaroos were honored as the first tag team to ever be inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in 2003,&lt;ref name="HOF"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/kangaroos.asp| title= 2003: The Fabulous Kangaroos| accessdate= 1 August 2007| author= the Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070806063340/http://pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/kangaroos.asp| archivedate= 6 August 2007| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which started a tradition of inducting a new team every year.&lt;ref name="HOFRules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwhf.org/about/about.asp |title=About the Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: Ballot Formation and Voting Process for Induction Purposes: |accessdate=1 August 2007 |author=the Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame |quote=One winner from each of the following categories shall be inducted each year: LADY WRESTLER, TAG TEAM, and NON-PARTICIPANT.

==Growing up==
Costa was born in Lingua di Salina, Italy, near [[Sicily]], and lived there until his family immigrated to Australia when he was six years old.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; The family settled in [[Rockdale, New South Wales]], where Costa helped out in his father’s [[fruit]] store. He excelled at school sports, and became interested in weightlifting at an early age. At age 16, Costa took up [[amateur boxing]] despite his father’s wishes that he should become an [[opera]] singer.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"/&gt; Costa was approached by Australian middleweight wrestling champion "Basher Bonas", who convinced him to try wrestling. Costa made his debut under an assumed name; his father still had hopes of him becoming an opera singer, and he did not want his parents to find out that he was wrestling. He came up with the name "Al Costello", thinking it sounded tough like a [[portmanteau]] of [[Al Capone]] and [[Frank Costello]].&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

==Wrestling career==
Al Costello made his professional wrestling debut in 1938, but the man that would be known as "The Man of a Thousand Holds" 20&amp;nbsp;years later, found little success early in his career. The general belief in Australian professional wrestling at the time was that a wrestler had to go to North America and learn how to be a pro before the bookers would even consider [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushing]] them up the [[List of professional wrestling slang#C|card]].&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; Costello travelled across Asia, where he did see some success; he won the [[Malaysia]]n Heavyweight title in 1939, as well as the South Africa trophy in 1949. During the 1950s, Costello finally started to turn heads at home by winning the Australasian title.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"/&gt; In 1952, Costello began wrestling in America, hoping to finally break through and make a big name of himself.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

===Fabulous Kangaroos===
{{Main|The Fabulous Kangaroos}}
For years, Al Costello had been working on an idea for a new tag team; he even knew who he wanted for a partner: a wrestler he had worked with some years ago named [[Roy Heffernan]]. Because Costello and Heffernan had lost touch over the years, the idea remained dormant until Costello toured [[Hawaii]] in 1956. Costello mentioned his idea of an "Ultra Australian" tag team to fellow wrestler, and future [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]], Joe Blanchard. Blanchard happened to be a good friend of Roy Heffernan and knew he was working in [[Stampede Wrestling]] at the time. Blanchard put the two in touch with each other, and Costello was soon off to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada to join Heffernan and finally make his tag team a reality. Costello and Heffernan debuted as "The Fabulous Kangaroos" on 3 May 1957 for [[Stu Hart]]’s [[Stampede Wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] in a match against Maurice LaPointe and Tony Baillargeon. Only weeks after that first match, The Kangaroos were working with the top tag teams in the promotion.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

After working in Stampede for a while, The Fabulous Kangaroos started to travel across the United States, headlining shows wherever they went due to their ability to rile up crowds with their [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (bad guy) tactics. On one occasion in August 1958, The Kangaroos, or "Kangaroo Men" as they were billed, nearly caused a riot in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] during a match against [[Antonino Rocca]] and [[Miguel Pérez (wrestler)|Miguel Pérez]]; the fans began to throw fruit and stones at them. After the match ended without a decisive winner, the promoters stepped in, turned up the arena lights, and played the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|National Anthem]] to stop a potential riot.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; This was a common tactic used at the time by the New York promoters in order to prevent riots and help the heels leave the arena unharmed.&lt;ref name="TagRiot"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005 | chapter= The Madison Square Garden riot of 1957 | pages= 130–134 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Costello and Heffernan started working for [[Dory Funk]]’s [[List of NWA territories|NWA Western States]] promotion based in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. Here, The Kangaroos won their first title as a team when they defeated Pepper Gomez and El Medico to win the Texas version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Texas version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] on 17 November 1958. Their first title reign was short lived, however, as Gomez and [[Rito Romero]] defeated them to regain the titles two weeks later.&lt;ref name="Titles"&gt;{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan &amp; Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1957 and 1965, The Kangaroos wrestled in the United States, Canada, Asia and select tours of Australia and New Zealand. They worked for such companies as [[World Wrestling Entertainment|Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] (the future World Wrestling Entertainment), [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Ohio]], the [[Japan Wrestling Association]] and the World Wrestling Association in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

The Kangaroos never forgot their roots and continued to work in Canada off and on through the years; in addition to Stampede Wrestling, the team also worked for [[NWA All-Star Wrestling]] based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Costello featured in a [[National Film Board of Canada]] [[short subject]] ''La Lotta''/''Wrestling''/''Le Catch''. Their stint in NWA All-Star Wrestling was the last time Costello and Heffernan teamed together. In June 1965, The Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan had left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States for a while longer.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

===Between Kangaroos===
Heffernan returned to Australia and began working for [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)|World Championship Wrestling]] (the Australian version, not the North American wrestling federation) under [[List of professional wrestling slang#B|booker]] [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] as a singles wrestler. Costello was originally supposed to return to Australia as well and work for WCW, but those plans never came through.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; Instead, Costello remained in the United States and kept working in the tag team division, never seeking a career as a singles wrestler. Costello began wrestling for [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]], where he teamed up with Louis Tillet to form a tag team known as "The Globetrotters"; a name that played off Costello’s Australian and Tillet’s French heritage.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"/&gt; The Globetrotters defeated the Mysterious Medics in the finals of the Georgia [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Georgia version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] but only held the titles for a week before losing them to Kurt and Karl Von Brauner on 4 February 1966.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; After this, the Globetrotters broke up due to differences in their approach to tag teaming.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"/&gt;

Costello then moved to the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Mid-America]] territory near [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In Mid-American, Costello teamed with Herb Welch to win the Mid-American version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]], which they held for just over 2 months.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; While still working in Mid-America, Costello began to team with Karl Von Brauner, who used a "German Nazi" gimmick despite being American. Under the management of [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|"Playboy" Gary Hart]], Costello and Von Brauner were billed as "The Internationals"; the team was later managed by George "Crybaby" Cannon.&lt;ref name="TopTenManager"&gt;{{cite book | author= Conner, Floyd | title=Wrestling's Most Wanted : The Top 10 Book of Pro Wrestling's Outrageous Performers, Punishing Piledrivers, and Other Oddities | publisher=Potomac Books | date =12 February 2001 | chapter= not everyone can be a world champion | pages= 227 | isbn=978-1-57488-308-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internationals worked mainly in [[Tennessee]] and [[Texas]] for NWA Western States. In Texas, Costello and Von Brauner won the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, a title Costello and Heffernan had held in 1958. The team was also billed as the first [[WCWA Tag Team Championship|NWA American Tag Team Champions]], titles that were also recognized by [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in addition to the Western States promotion. The Internationals lost the American Tag Team title to [[Fritz Von Erich|Fritz]] and [[Waldo Von Erich]] on 21 February 1967.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Kurt then decided to go back to teaming with his storyline brother, Karl Von Brauner.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"/&gt;

After the Internationals broke up, Costello returned to Australia to visit friends and relatives and to recuperate after many years on the road. On his way back to the United States, Costello had a stop over in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], where he met Cleo Williams. The two fell in love and married shortly afterwards, remaining together for the rest of Costello’s life.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"/&gt;

===Kangaroos once more===
{{Main|The Fabulous Kangaroos#Al Costello and Don Kent|l1=The Fabulous Kangaroos: Costello and Kent}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KangarooKent.jpg|left|thumb|200px|"Adopted Australian" [[Don Kent (wrestler)|Don Kent]].]] --&gt;

In 1967, Al Costello reformed The Fabulous Kangaroos, this time teaming up with Ray St. Clair. The team had been touring non-stop for about six months when St. Clair was forced to retire due to knee problems. A few months after St. Clair retired, Costello found a new man to don the bush hat: Don Kent. Kent, who was from [[Michigan]], adopted the Ultra-Australian [[List of professional wrestling slang#G|gimmick]] (but retained his American accent) and the two formed the third overall and second most well-known version of The Fabulous Kangaroos.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; Costello and Kent teamed together on a regular basis from 1968 until 1974, approximately the same amount of time that Costello spent teaming with his original partner, Roy Heffernan.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; Costello and Kent continued in a tradition that was reminiscent of the original Kangaroos; when a federation needed a new tag team title, The Kangaroos were brought in and acknowledged as champions upon arrival instead of holding a tournament to determine the champions. In 1967, the Japanese federation "International Wrestling Enterprise" (IWE) brought The Kangaroos in as the first Trans-World Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Champions. They held this title until 10 January 1968 when IWE mainstays Toyonobori and Thunder Sugiyama beat them for the gold.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; Over the years, many more title reigns came from various promotions all over the globe. In Canada, The Kangaroos were the first [[Eastern Sports Association]] [[ESA International Tag Team Championship|International Tag Team Champions]]. In the [[World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis)|World Wrestling Association]] of [[Indianapolis]], they held the WWA World Tag Team Championship twice.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; In addition to winning titles all over North America, Costello and Kent also made appearances for the [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation (1963-1979)|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (now known as [[WWE]]).&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

The Kangaroos frequented [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Detroit]], where they held the Detroit version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Detroit version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] for most of 1971.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; By the end of 1972, The Kangaroos began working for Nick Gulas’ NWA Mid-America. In Mid-America, they held the local version of the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version)|NWA World Tag Team Championship]], the Mid-America version, on three occasions.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

After a match at [[Cincinnati Gardens]], an enraged fan took a [[fire extinguisher]] off the wall and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much that he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15&amp;nbsp;days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"/&gt; Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

===Managing===
In 1975, Costello surprised everyone by returning to professional wrestling as the manager of the team known as "The Love Brothers" (Hartford and Reggie Love). He actually stepped into the ring on occasion as part of special six-man tag team matches.&lt;ref name="TagLove"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005 | chapter= The Love Brothers | pages= 205 | isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After recovering from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The fact that he was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout [[vegan]], Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in for a man of his age.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

Costello reformed The Fabulous Kangaroos once more, this time teaming up with wrestler Tony Charles. The team defeated [[Dominic DeNucci]] and Chris Markoff to win Detroit's version of the NWA World Tag Team title, the same title that Costello and Kent had previously held. The Kangaroos title run was short, however, and they lost their gold to [[Grady Johnson|"Crazy" Luke Graham]] and Ripper Collins.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt;

In 1977, Tony Charles was replaced by Don Kent and the two reunited for a tour of [[Puerto Rico]] with the [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC). In Puerto Rico, The Kangaroos arrived billed as the [[WWC World Tag Team Championship|WWC World Tag Team Champions]], once more to give a newly created title legitimacy. They dropped the titles to [[Carlos Colón, Sr.|Carlos Colón]] and Jose Rivera on 12 March 1977 and remained in the WWC until 1978 chasing, but never regaining, the WWC World Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; After their tour in Puerto Rico ended, Don Kent returned to singles wrestling, and Costello refocused on managing.

===Still a Kangaroo===
In 1981, Costello convinced Kent to once again don the bush hat and pick up the boomerang. Costello got Kent to team up with [[Bruno Bekkar]], who was mostly known from working in his native New Zealand and Australia. Kent and Bekkar worked a tour for the WWC, while Costello served as their manager.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; The team won the WWC North American Tag Team titles from [[Jack Brisco|Jack]] and [[Gerald Brisco|Jerry Brisco]] on 22 October 1981. They then lost the titles to [[Jose Gonzalez (wrestler)|Invader I]] and Super Gladiator but quickly gained them back before [[List of professional wrestling slang#D|dropping]] the titles for good to Invader and Gladiator on 26 January 1982.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; The Kent and Bekkar team only lasted through one tour of the [[Caribbean]], after which Bruno Bekkar returned to Australia and New Zealand to work for the local promotions there.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

Bekkar was replaced with Johnny Heffernan (Canadian wrestler Bob Della Serra), a storyline cousin of Roy Heffernan, for what was the final version of The Fabulous Kangaroos.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; The team ended [[Terry Funk|Terry]] and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]]'s year and a half run with the WWC World Tag Team championship on 1 May 1982. Kent and Heffernan held the gold for less than two months before losing the WWC World Tag Team titles to Invader I and Pierre Martel.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; After a tour in Puerto Rico, Costello, Kent and Heffernan returned to work for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] (CWF), a promotion The Kangaroos last worked for in 1962. In Florida, The Kangaroos won the [[NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship]] four times.&lt;ref name="Titles"/&gt; The final storyline involving The Fabulous Kangaroos saw Al Costello bring in [[J.J. Dillon]] to act as his short term replacement while he was "away on business". When Costello returned from his business trip, Dillon [[kayfabe]] refused to give up The Kangaroos' contracts and was backed up by both Kent and Heffernan. This [[List of professional wrestling slang#A|angle]] was designed to write Al Costello out of The Fabulous Kangaroos' storyline and allow him to retire from wrestling altogether.&lt;ref name="OneLegends"/&gt; Not long after Costello retired, Kent and Johnny Heffernan went their separate ways.&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt;

===Retirement===
After retiring from wrestling, Al Costello became the head of security at College Harbor, Florida. In 1992, at the age of 71, Costello retired from his job in Florida and began teaching wrestling. He also started to manage '''The New Fabulous Kangaroos''' in 1993, a team consisting of Mickey Doyle and Denny Kass who worked for "Motor City Wrestling" (MCW).&lt;ref name="TagKanga"/&gt; By the fall of 1993, Mickey Doyle had been replaced by a young wrestler by the name of [[Al Snow]]; with Costello’s help The New Fabulous Kangaroos defeated "Canadian Lighting" (Otis Apollo and "Irish" Bobby Clancy), on 29 December 1993, to win the MCW Tag Team Championship.&lt;ref name="MCWTag"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.detroitsports-mcw.com/mcwwrestling.php | title= MCW Wrestling Results | accessdate=1 August 2007 | publisher=Detroit Sports MCW}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 1994, Kass and Snow defeated Canadian Lighting again to win the [[Border City Wrestling]] (BCW) [[BCW Can-Am Tag Team Championship|Can-Am Tag Team Championship]], unifying the two tag team championships. A week later, The New Fabulous Kangaroos lost both sets of titles to [[Scott D'Amore]] and "Irish" Bobby Clancy.&lt;ref name="BCWTag"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/on/bcw/bcw-t.html | title= BCW Can-Am Tag Team Title history | accessdate=1 August 2007 | publisher=Wrestling-Titles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After losing the unified MCW/BCW Tag Team championships, The New Kangaroos split up; Snow focused on his [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] career while Costello retired for good, never making another wrestling related appearance.&lt;!--What happened to Kass?--&gt;

===Death===
On 22 January 2000, Costello died from a combination of [[pneumonia]] and [[heart]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive2000/jan24_costello.html | title = Fabulous Kangaroo Al Costello dead | accessdate = 3 August 2007 | author = Greg Oliver | publisher = Slam!Wrestling| quote = Al Costello, one half of the famed Fabulous Kangaroos, died Saturday, January&amp;nbsp;22, 2000 at the age of 80. He had been suffering from pneumonia and had some heart problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Al Costello and Roy Heffernan became the first tag team to ever be inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="HOF"/&gt; Since that time, the Hall of Fame has honored other tag teams, but The Fabulous Kangaroos were given the honor of being the first. In the tradition of the Kangaroos, they were "billed as champions on arrival" one last time.&lt;ref name="HOFRules"/&gt;

'''''American Machinists' Handbook''''' was a [[McGraw-Hill]] reference book similar to Industrial Press's ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]''. (The latter title, still in print and regularly revised, is the one that machinists today are usually referring to when they speak imprecisely of "the machinist's handbook" or "the machinists' handbook".)

The somewhat generic sound of the title ''American Machinists' Handbook'', and the ambiguity of its apostrophe usage, no doubt contributed to the confounding of the two books' titles and identities. It capitalized on readers' familiarity with ''[[American Machinist]]'', McGraw-Hill's popular trade journal. But the usage could have benefited from some branding discipline, because the confusion over whether the title was properly "American Machinist's Handbook" or "American Machinists' Handbook" or "''American Machinist'' 's Handbook" was (and is) considerable. ("''American Machinist'' 's Handbook" would be parallel to the construction of the title "''Machinery's'' Handbook"; perhaps McGraw-Hill's handbook's title was originally conceived as that and later was muddied into "American Machinists' Handbook".)

Although McGraw-Hill's ''American Machinists' Handbook'' appeared first (1908), it is doubtful that Industrial Press's ''Machinery's Handbook'' (1914) was a mere me-too conceived afterwards in response. The eager market for such a reference work had probably been obvious for at least a decade before either work was compiled, and presumably the appearance of the McGraw-Hill title merely prodded Industrial Press to finally get moving on a handbook of its own.

''American Machinists' Handbook'', coedited by [[Fred H. Colvin]] and Frank A. Stanley, went through eight editions between 1908 and 1945. In 1955, McGraw-Hill published ''The new American machinist's handbook. Based upon earlier editions of American machinists' handbook'' (sic; note the apostrophe usage difference within that title), but presumably the book did not compete well enough with ''Machinery's Handbook'', because no subsequent editions were produced. Meanwhile, ''[[Machinery's Handbook]]'' has continued to be regularly revised and updated, right up to today, and it is still a "bible of the metalworking industries."

'''''An universal, historical, geographical, chronological and poetical dictionary''''', published in early 1703 was the first English language reference work to present general information in an alphabetical format.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, S. Padraig, 1922- ''Anglo-American general encyclopedias: a historical bibliography, 1703-1967'' New York : Bowker, p.171&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work was considered inferior in quality to another work, the ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'', which came out a few months later the same year and is considered the first "true" English language encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austronesian alignment''', commonly known as the '''Philippine-type voice system''', is a typologically unusual kind of [[morphosyntactic alignment]] in which "one argument can be marked as having a special relationship to the verb"&lt;ref&gt;Blust (2013), page 436.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This special relationship manifests itself as a [[Voice_(grammar)|voice]] [[affix]] on the verb that corresponds to a noun (i.e., the subject) within the same clause that is either marked for a particular [[grammatical_case|case]] or found in a privileged structural position within the clause or both.

Austronesian alignment is best known from the [[languages of the Philippines]], but is also found in [[Taiwan]]'s [[Formosan languages]], as well as in [[Borneo]], Northern [[Sulawesi]], and [[Madagascar]], and has been reconstructed for the ancestral [[Proto-Austronesian]] language. 

The examples&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Blust (2013)'s examples in Table 7.2, (a) sentences.  Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.&lt;/ref&gt; below are in Proto-Austronesian.  Asterisks indicate a reconstruction.  The voice affix on the verb appears in &lt;span style="color:#FF0000"&gt;red text&lt;/span&gt;, while the subject, which the affix [[Selection_(linguistics)|selects]], appears in '''''&lt;u&gt;underlined bold italics&lt;/u&gt;'''''.  Four voices have been reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian:  ''Agent Trigger'', ''Patient Trigger'', ''Locative Trigger'' and ''Instrument Trigger''.

==Description==
Whereas most languages have two [[grammatical voice|voice]]s which are used to track [[referent]]s in discourse, a [[transitive verb|transitive]] [[active voice|'active']] voice and an [[intransitive]] '[[passive voice|passive]]' or '[[antipassive]]' voice, prototypical Philippine languages have two voices, which are both transitive. One of the two Philippine voices is similar, in form, to the active voice of ergative–absolutive languages, and the other is similar to the active voice of nominative–accusative languages. They perform functions similar to the active and passive/antipassive voices, respectively, in those languages.

The ergative-like Philippine voice used to be often called the "passive," and the accusative-like voice has often been called the "active." However, that terminology is misleading and now deprecated, partly because the "passive" is the default voice in Austronesian languages, and a true passive is a secondary voice; however, no substitute terms have been widely accepted. Among the more common terms proposed are ''patient trigger'' (the ergative-like voice) and ''agent trigger'' (the accusative-like voice), which will be used here. The phrases are taken from the terms '[[agent (grammar)|agent]]' and '[[patient (grammar)|patient]]', which are used in [[semantics]] for the acting and acted-upon participants in a transitive [[clause]].

The three types of voice system and the grammatical cases of their [[core argument]]s can be contrasted as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

! Case of basic intransitive clause

The Philippine cases are only approximately equivalent to their namesakes in other languages and so are placed in quotes. ("Direct," as used here, is commonly called "nominative" or "absolutive", for example.) The "ergative" case is identical in form to the Philippine [[genitive case]], but it is common in ergative languages for the ergative case to have the form of an [[oblique case]] like the genitive or the [[locative case]].

The reconstructed Proto-Malayo-Polynesian examples below&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Lynch, Ross and Crowley (2002)'s examples on page 59.  Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrate the Philippine system. (Asterisks indicate a reconstruction.) The [[markedness|unmarked]] clause order was to have the verb first and the "direct" phrase last. The voice was indicated by an [[affix]] to the verb ([[infix]] ''-um-'' for agent trigger and [[suffix]] ''-ən'' for patient trigger). In modern Philippine languages, the practical effect of the voice distinction is rather like the difference between sentences with [[definiteness|definite]] patients and sentences with indefinite patients (i.e., the use of ''a'' and ''the'' with [[Object_(grammar)|direct objects]]) in English, and it is assumed to have played a similar role in the protolanguage.

In the example in (1) below, the agent ''a manuk'' "the chicken" is in sentence-final, subject position.  The verb appears with the ''-um-'' agent trigger infix.  In (2), however, the patient ''a wai'' "the mango" is in subject position, and the verb is marked with the ''-ən'' patient trigger suffix.  Note that, in (1), the patient ''ta wai'' translates to "a mango".

Philippine-type languages have more than two voices. Beside the ones shown above, there would be also [[locative case|locative]] and [[benefactive case|benefactive]] voices.  The locative trigger is illustrated below in (3); the ''-an'' suffix on the verb [[Selection_(linguistics)|selects]] ''a kahiw'' "the tree", which is the location of the action, as the subject:

==Examples==
The various Austronesian languages sampled below demonstrate that the number of voices differs from language to language.  While the majority sampled have four voices, it is possible to have as few as three voices, and as many as six voices. In the examples below, the voice affix on the verb appears in &lt;span style="color:#FF0000"&gt;red text&lt;/span&gt;, while the subject, which the affix [[Selection_(linguistics)|selects]], appears in '''''&lt;u&gt;underlined bold italics&lt;/u&gt;'''''.

===Formosan===
The data below come from [[Formosan_languages|Formosan]] primarily spoken in [[Taiwan]].

[[Saaroa_language|Hla’alua]]&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Pan (2012)'s examples in (3.16b), (3.23a), (3.32d) and (3.33a).  Glosses and translation modified for the Wikipedia article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The orthography used in this subsection does not conform to the orthography used in Pan (2012) with respect to the consonant /ɬ/.  Whereas Pan (2012) represents this sound as ‹lh›, this sound is represented here as ‹hl› (Pan (2012; page 50)).&lt;/ref&gt; has three voices:  ''Agent Trigger'', ''Patient Trigger'' and ''Circumstantial Trigger''.

The circumstantial trigger suffix selects for locative and theme subjects.

While [[clitic|bound]] pronouns have a direct case form, nouns do not bear a special direct [[grammatical_case|case marker]] for subjects in Hla’alua.

Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.&lt;/ref&gt; has four voices:  ''Agent Trigger'', ''Patient Trigger'', ''Locative Trigger'', and ''Benefactive Trigger''.  In addition to the voice morphology on the main verb, auxiliary verbs in Tsou, which are obligatory in the sentence&lt;ref&gt;Zeitoun (2005), page 266&lt;/ref&gt;, are also marked for voice.  However, auxiliaries only differentiate between ''agent trigger'' and ''non-agent trigger''&lt;ref&gt;Zeitoun (2005), page 267 ("actor voice" and "undergoer voice", respectively, in her terminology).&lt;/ref&gt; (in &lt;span style="color:#FF6666"&gt;pink text&lt;/span&gt;).

===Philippine===
The data below come from [[Philippine languages]], a subgroup under [[Malayo-Polynesian_languages|Malayo-Polynesian]], predominantly spoken across the [[Philippines]], with some found on the island of [[Sulawesi]] in [[Indonesia]].

====Blaan====
[[Blaan_language|Blaan]]&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Abrams (1970)'s examples on page 2.  Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrams (1970, pages 1-2) indicates that Blaan verbs are classified into three types of ''prefocus bases'', each of which has an inherent voice without bearing any voice [[affix|affixes]].  An ''agent'' prefocus base is a bare verb that is inherently in agent trigger voice.  A ''goal'' prefocus base is inherently in goal trigger voice, and an ''instrument'' prefocus base is inherently in instrument trigger voice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaan has two morphemes which, when attached to a prefocus base, change the inherent voice of the base.  These morphemes are the agent trigger affix, ''m-''/''-am-'', and the non-agent trigger affix, ''n-''/''-an-''  ("subject focus" and "non-subject focus" in Abrams (1970, page 1)'s terminology, respectively).&lt;/ref&gt; has three voices: ''Agent Trigger'', ''Goal Trigger'', and ''Instrument Trigger''.

The goal trigger voice selects for patient and location subjects.

{|
| colspan=14 | &lt;u&gt;Agent Prefocus Base&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrams (1970, page 2) has not found many examples of an agent prefocus base taking either of the voice-changing morphemes.  However, in that rare example in which an agent prefocus base does, both voice-changing morphemes transitivize the intransitive agent prefocus base.  In addition, the agent trigger affix keeps the base in agent trigger voice, while the non-agent trigger affix changes the voice of the base to goal trigger voice.&lt;/ref&gt; || colspan=14 | &lt;u&gt;Goal Prefocus Base&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Without any voice-changing morphemes, goal prefocus bases take patient subjects.  The agent trigger affix changes the voice of the base to agent trigger voice, allowing the base to take an agent subject.  The goal trigger affix allows a goal prefocus base to take location subjects.&lt;/ref&gt; || colspan=8 | &lt;u&gt;Instrument Prefocus Base&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The agent trigger affix changes the inherent instrument trigger voice of the base to agent trigger voice, whereas the non-agent trigger affix changes the voice to goal trigger voice.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kapampangan====
[[Kapampangan_language|Kapampangan]]&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Mirikitani (1972)'s examples in (64), (95), (96), (100), (101) and (106). Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.&lt;/ref&gt; has five voices:  ''Agent Trigger'', ''Patient Trigger'', ''Goal Trigger'', ''Locative Trigger'', and ''Cirumstantial Trigger''.

The circumstantial trigger prefix selects for instrument and benefactee subjects.

The direct case morpheme in Kapampangan is ''ing'', which marks singular subjects, and ''reng'', which is for plural subjects.  Non-subject agents are marked with ergative case, ''ning'', while non-subject patients are marked with accusative case, ''-ng'', which is [[Clitic|cliticized]] onto the preceding word.&lt;ref&gt;In the examples, the word to which the accusative case marker attaches is a pronoun or [[portmanteau]] pronoun that is obligatorily present in the same clause as the noun with which it is [[Coreference|co-referential]].  In sentences with an agent trigger, the pronoun co-refers with the agent subject.  In sentences with a non-agent trigger, the portmanteau pronoun co-refers with both the ergative agent and the non-agent subject, which is marked with direct case.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tagalog====
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] has six voices:  ''Agent Trigger'', ''Patient Trigger'', ''Locative Trigger'', ''Benefactive Trigger'', ''Instrument Trigger'', and ''Reason Trigger''.

The locative trigger suffix selects for location and goal subjects.  (In the examples below, the goal subject and the benefactee subject are the same noun phrase.)

The reason trigger prefix can only be affixed to certain roots, the majority of which are for emotion verbs (e.g., ''galit'' "be angry", ''sindak'' "be shocked").  However, verb roots such as ''matay'' "die", ''sakit'' "get sick", and ''iyak'' "cry" may also be marked with the reason trigger prefix.

The direct case morpheme, which marks subjects in Tagalog, is ''ang''.  The indirect case morpheme, ''ng'' /naŋ/, which is the conflation of the ergative and accusative cases seen in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, marks non-subject agents and non-subject patients.

Unlike other languages presented here, Kelabit does not use case-marking or word-ordering strategies to indicate the subject of the clause&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings (2016) presents examples in which the subject in patient trigger voice appears before the verb, and in which the subject in agent trigger voice appears after the verb&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, certain syntactic processes, such as [[relative_clause|relativization]], target the subject.  Relativizing non-subjects results in ungrammatical sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings (2016; pages 202-203).&lt;/ref&gt;.

The orthography used here conforms to the orthography used in Kroeger (2017).  Glosses and translations modified for the Wikipedia article.&lt;/ref&gt; has five voices:  ''Agent Trigger'', ''Patient Trigger'', ''Benefactive Trigger'', ''Instrument Trigger'' and ''Locative Trigger''.

Only intransitive verbs can be marked with the locative trigger suffix&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger (2017), page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;, which looks similar to the patient trigger suffix&lt;ref&gt;According to Kroeger (2005; page 415, table (45)), the patient trigger suffix has two [[allomorph|allomorphs]], ''-on'' and ''-∅''.  The former occurs in non-past contexts, whereas the latter in past contexts.  The locative trigger suffix does not exhibit such allomorphy, and can appear in both past and non-past contexts.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The direct case marker, which marks the subject in Kimaragang, is ''it'' for definite nouns and ''ot'' for indefinite nouns.

'''''Benson v SA Mutual Life Assurance Society'''''&lt;ref&gt;1986 (1) SA 776 (A).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African contract law]], particularly in the area of claims for specific performance. It was heard in the Appellate Division, by Corbett JA, Kotzé JA, Hefer JA, Galgut AJA and Cillié AJA, on 7 November 1985, with judgment handed down on 29 November.

The court determined that the granting of an order of specific performance is entirely a matter of the discretion of the court. Apart from the rule that such discretion is to be exercised judicially upon all the relevant facts, no rules should be prescribed to regulate that discretion, as such rules would inevitably curtail the court's discretion and negate or erode the plaintiff's right to select his remedy.

The [[English law|English rule]]s regulating courts' discretion to order specific performance are predicated upon that remedy's availability by way of equitable relief only; they are inappropriate to [[South African law]]. The Appellate Division held, therefore, that the indiscrimate following of English cases in this regard is to be decried.

The decision of the Cape Provincial Division, in ''SA Mutual Life Assurance Society v Benson'' (granting an order of specific performance in an action for delivery of shares freely obtainable on the Stock Exchange) was by this reasoning confirmed.

The Court ruled that the Moment of Quiet Reflection was not unconstitutional. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] denied [[certiorari]] for an appeal.

== Background ==
The State of Georgia passed the Moment of Quiet Reflection in Schools Act, which came into effect in 1994. The law did not require or endorse [[prayer]],&lt;ref name="trojan"&gt;[http://candst.tripod.com/dawn1.htm Brockman, D. "A Moment of Silence: The Trojan Horse of Our Age."]&lt;/ref&gt; saying that it "is not intended to be and shall not be conducted as a religious service or exercise".&lt;ref name="trojan"/&gt;

Public school teacher Brian Bown challenged the Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XXCYV-yuqQcC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;lpg=PA289&amp;dq=bown+v+gwinnett&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5Zwwtv2MaE&amp;sig=_8NHMmNC2WcbEoi2UjyBPxWIbaA Fontana, V. "Municipal Liability: Law and Practice," pg. 289].&lt;/ref&gt; He sued the [[Gwinnett County School District]], alleging that the law was an [[Establishment Clause]] violation implicitly requiring school prayer.&lt;ref name="trojan"/&gt; At trial, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]] ruled that the Act did not violate the establishment clause.&lt;ref&gt;Larry R.

== History ==
Deer designed his classification system while working in the library of the [[National Indian Brotherhood]] from 1974-1976, with the goal of reflecting indigenous viewpoints and values in knowledge organization. Between 1978 and 1980, the system was adapted for use in [[British Columbia]] by [[Gene Joseph]] and Keltie McCall while working at the [[Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Lambayeque gold mask.jpg|thumb|[[Lambayeque culture|Lambayeque]] funerary gold mask in Brüning Museum]]
The '''Brüning Museum''', also known as '''Museo Regional Arqueológico Enrique Bruning de Lambayeque''' was inaugurated in 1924 and it is located in two blocks of the principal park in [[Lambayeque, Peru]]. It was based on the collections of [[Hans Heinrich Brüning]], a German researcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sibmas.org/idpac/south-america/pel001.html International Directory of Performing Arts Collections and Institutions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203402/http://www.sibmas.org/idpac/south-america/pel001.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an excellent museum based on the collections that Bruning gathered at the end of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century. The Peruvian government acquired this collection from Bruning in 1924. This museum has been constantly enriched by pieces obtained in confiscations, donations and discoveries. The most recent procurement are the pieces acquired in the Tomb of the "[[Lord of Sipán]]". His remains and the mortuary trousseau are displayed at the museum. The Golden Room shows up to 500 works of art.

The museum was constructed as a modern and functional facility, inspired by the works of the 20th-century French architect, [[Le Corbusier]]. The more than 1500 pieces come from different indigenous cultures, including an invaluable textile collection and ceramics of [[Chimú culture|Chimú]] and [[Vicús culture|Vicús]]. Thousands of golden objects are kept in sealed rooms, including funeral masks of copper, ceremonial vessels, an extraordinary necklace and jewelry of [[Moche (culture)|Mochica]] and Chimú cultures, as well as pieces of the [[Lambayeque culture]].

In the gardens of the museum is a statue dedicated to the mythical figure of [[Naylamp]], founder of the Lambayecanos Kings' dynasty. The front facade has a mural with Lambayecanos motifs. The interior of the principal building is a sequence of four levels, which in total  exhibit more than 1,400 archaeological pieces. These represent the Lambayeque, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Chavín culture|Chavín]], [[Vicús culture|Vicús]], [[Inca Empire|Inca]] cultures and others. Some of the most important pieces date to more than 10,000 years ago.

The '''Camp de Rivesaltes''', also known as '''Camp Maréchal Joffre''', is a military camp in the commune of [[Rivesaltes]] nearby [[Perpignan]] in the department of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] in the South of France. The camp was also used to detain civil populations several times between 1939 and 2007. Its darkest period was in 1942, when 2,251 [[Jews]], including 110 children, were transferred from Rivesaltes via the [[Drancy internment camp]] to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz]], where they were murdered.

==History==
In 1935, the commune of [[Rivesaltes]], situated on a rail route 40&amp;nbsp;km from the Spanish border, was considered a strategic position for the [[French army]], which took over 612 hectares between Rivesaltes and [[Salses]], 5&amp;nbsp;km from the city of Rivesaltes, to construct a camp. It was originally intended to be used as a military base. At the same time, southern France became a major haven for Jewish refugees attempting to flee to neutral countries, whether legally or illegally.

===Creation (1938–1940)===
[[Image:RivesaltesMemorial2.jpg|thumb|Commemorative [[stele]] for survivors of the [[Spanish Civil War]]]]

The military camp was built in 1938, a few miles from [[Perpignan]]. Four-fifths of the camp was situated within the commune of Rivesaltes and one-fifth within the commune of Salses. The camp was named "Camp Joffre" after General [[Joseph Joffre]], the commander-in-chief of the French army during World War I.&lt;ref name=LestWeForget&gt;{{cite web|author=Kate |url=http://www.anglophone-direct.com/Rivesaltes-internment-camp-camp |title=Rivesaltes internment camp - camp Joffre |website=Anglophone-direct |date= |accessdate=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Retirada (the exodus of about half a million refugees from Spain to France in early 1939 during the [[Spanish Civil War]]),&lt;ref name=Retirada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglophone-direct.com/La-Retirada |title=La Retirada |website=Anglophone-direct.com |date=1945-03-15 |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French government decided to use Camp Joffre to intern more than 15,000 Catalan refugees. This decision was never fully put into action, although a small influx of Catalan refugees was held there in 1939.

On December 10, 1940, the Ministry of Defense set aside {{convert|600|acre|km2}} south of the camp to house people expelled from Germany. The military camp was then run in parallel with the civilian camps.

In 1939, at the start of World War II, the camp became a military transit base, and in 1940 a refuge for Spanish refugees fleeing from  [[Francoist Spain]]. After the signing of the [[armistice]], France was split into two. The ''zone libre'' ("free zone"), in which the Pyrénées-Orientales was included, came under the administration of the [[Vichy government]].

Gradually, the Joffre camp became a place of internment for families of [[Romani people|gypsies]], [[Jews]] and Spanish refugees. With a capacity of 8000, before long the camp became overcrowded, families were separated, and conditions deteriorated greatly.

===Accommodation center (1941–1942)===
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S69238, Frankreich, Internierungslager Pithiviers.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[French Police]] checking new inmates in the camp [[Pithiviers]]]]
When the first internees arrived on January 14, 1941, the status of the camp was not yet settled. It was decided to make it an "accommodation center" for families. Initially planned for a maximum of 17,000 "guests", it included 150 large barracks with a capacity of 10,000 individuals. Families were divided between barracks: there were barracks for men, others for women and children. By May 31, 1941, the camp had 6,475 internees from 16 nationalities; Spaniards constituted more than half of them, and Jewish refugees from other countries more than a third.

===Transit camp (1942)===
[[Image:France map Lambert-93 with regions and departments-occupation.svg|thumb|[[France]] under German occupation ([[Nazis]] occupied the southern zone starting in November 1942 — Operation [[Case Anton]]). The green zone was under [[Italian Fascism|Italian]] administration.]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-107-24, Frankreich, Einsatz gegen die Resistance.jpg|thumb|French [[milice]] and [[resistants]]]]

At five o'clock in the morning on August 26, 1942, the foreign Jews in the southern zone were rounded up and taken to the ''Centre national de rassemblement des Israélites'' at Rivesaltes. This "center" was newly established in the camp, in blocks J (for women and children), F (for men; this block had previously been reserved for workers) and K (reception, screening and sorting). It was planned as a transit camp for a total of 10,000 internees who would be housed there for 15 days before being deported. The 1,176 Jews already in the camp prior to the round-up were included in this count.

Convoys left Rivesaltes for [[Drancy internment camp]] on August 11 (400 people), August 23 (175 people), September 1 (173 people), September 4 (621 people), September 14 (594 people), September 21 (72 people), September 28 (70 people), October (101 people) and October 20 (107 people).

[[Serge Klarsfeld]] called the Rivesaltes camp "the Drancy of the free zone", noting that from September 4 to October 22 it played the same role as the Drancy camp in the occupied zone: a transit camp for deportees whose ultimate destination was the Nazi extermination camps. Rivesaltes was, during that time, the camp where the Jews arrested in the so-called "free zone" were gathered, and from which many of them (about 1,700) were sent to Drancy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Klarsfeld |first=Serge |year=2001 |url=http://www.ahicf.com/ww2/actes/9klarsf.rtf |title=L’acheminement des Juifs de province vers Drancy et les déportations|website=Ahicf.com|accessdate=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1942, as Germany invaded the [[German occupation of France during World War II|previously unoccupied]] southern zone of France, German troops moved into Camp Joffre, and it was closed as an internment camp on November 25. There were 277 staff members when it closed.

During those two years, the camp of Rivesaltes housed about 21,000 internees; about 5,714 of them were interned in the "special camp" or transit camp, of whom 2,313 were sent to Drancy and 2,251 were excluded from deportation by the screening committee. A further 215 internees died in the camp, including 51 children one year old or younger.

===Guarded residence center (1944–1946)===
The German army left Rivesaltes on August 19, 1944. While the military part of Rivesaltes camp resumed its original purpose, a new "guarded residence center" was established there on September 12, 1944. Located chiefly in block Q, this center housed people interned under the [[Vichy regime]]'s ''épuration'' ("purification") policy. It had a maximum capacity of 1,080 internees.

The center continued to receive people from other European countries: Spaniards interned for crossing the border illegally were put to work to secure the center, and in January and March 1945 several hundreds of Soviet prisoners of war arrived.

The closing of the center was decided upon on December 10, 1945, and completed early in October 1946.

===Prisoner-of-war depot (1944–1948)===
The military authority transformed the camp into Depot No. 162 for prisoners of war. Housing mostly German and Italian soldiers, this camp held less than 10,000 prisoners in October 1944, and between 6,000 and 7,000 men in May 1945. It closed on May 1, 1948. The prisoners worked extensively on the reconstruction of the [[Roussillon]] region. Between May 1945 and 1946, 412 German prisoners of war died in the camp.

==Post Second World War==
This facility continued to be used after the events of the Second World War. The Algerian war was the next opportunity to use the facility to detain people.

===Algerian war (1962)===
Under the stiffening{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} of the French state caused by the [[Algerian War]], the French government planned in 1957 to create an [[internment camp]] on the site. The [[Prefect]]{{Clarify|date=January 2012|post-text=(of what?)}} tried to dissuade them because, in addition to a training center populated mainly by North Africans, the site contained a Professional Military Training Center particularly for North Africans and young soldiers mobilized for war. The plan was not carried out in its entirety, but a prison was set up discreetly for people convicted of being supporters of Algerian independence, and 527 prisoners were held there between March 9 and April 18, 1962.

===Transit and rehabilitation camp (1962–1977)===

====Harkis====
''[[Harkis]]'' is the generic term for Muslim Algerians serving as auxiliaries with the French Army during the Algerian War (1954–1962).

In June 1962, the 1st regiment of Algerian riflemen was repatriated to Camp Joffre. They brought with them hundreds of civilians, women and children running away from the new independent [[Algeria]]. In October 1962, about 8000 Harkis were staying at the transit and rehabilitation camp of Rivesaltes (including those from the camp of [[Larzac]] and [[Bourg-Lastic]]). In all, according to the calculations of Abderahmen Moumen, about 20,000 people passed through and accumulated in the camp from 1962 to 1964. The stay varied from a few days for some families to years for others.

Families considered "irretrievable"—a term used by administrators at the time—were sent at the end of 1964 to the Saint-Maurice-l'Ardoise military camp in the [[Gard]] until 1975. Several hundred more families who had employment but no housing were accommodated in a "civil village" in the Rivesaltes camp during the 1960s. In 1963, a forestry village was also created in Rivesaltes for about 25 families of former auxiliaries (about a hundred people). The next decade saw the bulk of this population moved to the [[HLM]] (rent-controlled housing) of Rearte, built in the city of Rivesaltes to finalize the situation of these families. The last residents left the camp in February 1977.

====Colonial auxiliaries====
Other [[French Colonial Forces]] and auxiliaries from Africa and [[French Indochina]] came, accompanied by civilians, with the [[Decolonization#French decolonization|decolonization]] of the [[French colonial empire]]: from 1964 to 1966 about 600 [[French Guinea|Guineans]] arrived, and other former soldiers and their families came from French Indochina.

==Immigration detention center (1986–2007)==
Created in 1986, the [[Immigration detention|administrative detention center]] was set up to detain Spanish nationals who had entered French territory illegally. With more than a thousand arrested on French soil in 1994, it was one of the largest detention centers in [[France]]. It was closed in 2007.

==The Rivesaltes memorial museum==

French Name: ''Mémorial du Camp de Rivesaltes''

The memorial museum project has its origins in Serge Klarsfeld's 1978 publication of the list of [[The Holocaust|deported Jews]] and Jews who died in the camp of Rivesaltes.

*In 1993, Klarsfeld published "The transfer of Jews from the camp of Rivesaltes and the Montpellier area towards the center of Drancy for deportation on August 10, 1942."
*On January 16, 1994, Klarsfeld's association "Sons and daughters of Jews deported from France" erected a monument to the memory of 2,313 Jews deported from the Rivesaltes camp to [[Auschwitz]].
*On December 2, 1995, a monument to the Harkis was installed.
*In 1997, a collective petition "To the living memory of the camp of Rivesaltes" was signed by [[Simone Veil]], [[Claude Simon]], [[Edgar Morin]] and many citizens to protest against threats to destroy the camp.
*In 1998, [[Christian Bourquin]], the new president of the [[General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales]], opposed the destruction of the site and started public consultations on the project.
*On October 30, 1999, a [[stele]] was erected in memory of the Republicans of the Spanish Civil War.
*In 2000, the French Ministry of Culture included the site in its supplementary list of [[Monuments historiques]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610130613/http://www.culture.fr/fr/sections/regions/languedoc_roussillon/organisme/JEP-ORGS168639?typeSearch=SearchableTextagencies&amp;=&amp;=SearchWhere] 
&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2005, on the French [[European Heritage Days|Heritage Day]], part of the camp was opened to the public for the first time.
*[[Rudy Ricciotti]] won the architecture competition.
*[[Robert Badinter]] agreed to sponsor the project.
*In November 2005, the [[General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales]] acquired F block, about 42 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cg66.fr/culture/memorial/index.html |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410052728/http://www.cg66.fr/culture/memorial/index.html|title=Une communauté de destins, la souffrance des internés, la solidarité en œuvre |archivedate=April 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On January 21, 2009, architect Rudy Ricciotti filed the [[construction permit]]. Work was expected to start in 2010 and take two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batiweb.com/news/a.asp?ref=06010202&amp;titre=L-architecte-Rudy-Ricciotti-construira-m%C3%A9morial-of-camp-RivesaltesthemeUrl&amp;rub=&amp;= |title=L'architecte Rudy Ricciotti construira le mémorial du camp de Rivesaltes : 03-01-2006 |website=Batiweb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106053352/http://www.cg66.com/culture/memorial/revue_presse/RP_avril_mai_08.pdf]

{{distinguish|Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa}}
The '''''Chronicle of Edessa''''' is a record of the history of [[Edessa]] written in the mid 6th century in [[Syriac language]].

== Description ==

The ''Chronicle of Edessa'' is generally agreed to have been written around {{CE|540-550}}.{{efn|mid 6th century {{harv|Ferguson|1999|p=267}}, {{CE|540}} {{harv|Palmer|1999|p=421}}, {{CE|550}} ({{harvnb|Schnabel|2004|p=899}}; {{harvnb|Yamauchi|1983|p=85}}). {{harvtxt|Samuel|Santiago|Thiagarajan|2008}} claim without explanation that it was written in {{CE|590}} (p. 97).}} The ''Chronicle'' primarily used old Edessan royal archives as its source, as well as some more recent church records,{{sfn|Palmer|1999|p=421}} and accordingly is thought to be historically reliable.{{sfn|Teixidor|2015|p=148}}{{sfn|Baum|Winkler|2003|p=13}}{{sfn|Yamauchi|1983|p=85}}

It is extant in only a single manuscript, ''Vatican Syriac 163''.{{sfn|Bringham Young University|2004}} This manuscript was acquired by [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]] during a trip to the [[Near East]] from {{CE|1715-1717}} taken at the request of [[Pope Clement XI]].{{sfn|Bringham Young University|2004}}

The ''Chronicle'' begins with a record of a flood during the reign of [[Abgar VIII]] in November {{CE|201}} which damaged a Christian church building in Edessa.{{sfn|Ferguson|1999|p=267}}{{sfn|Schnabel|2004|p=899}} This is the earliest mention of a building dedicated exclusively to Christian worship,{{sfn|Myers|2010|p=35}} as well as one of few records of Christianity in Edessa at this time.{{sfn|Frenschkowski|2015|p=464}}{{sfn|Schnabel|2004|p=899}} Also, unlike other [[Syriac literature]], the ''Chronicle'' does ''not'' contain any legends of the [[Apostle Thaddeus]].{{sfn|Baum|Winkler|2003|p=13}}{{sfn|Yamauchi|1983|p=85}}

The '''''Chronicon Helveticum''''' (Latin for "Swiss Chronicle") is one of the oldest accounts of the early history of the [[Swiss Confederation]].

The rough draft of the ''Chronicon Helveticum'' was written by Swiss historian [[Aegidius Tschudi]] in 1550.&lt;ref name="bergier_16"&gt;Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tschudi seems to have made the last revisions between 1569 and 1570, the monumental work did not appear in printed form until [[Johann Rudolf Iselin]] published a two-volume edition in 1734, giving it the name by which it is known today.&lt;ref name="potter_39"&gt;Potter, p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tell Museum"&gt;Führer durch das Tell-Museum in Bürglen am Klausenpass&lt;/ref&gt;

Tschudi’s ''Chronicon Helveticum'' plays an important part in the historiography of [[Switzerland]], since it contains copies of about 50 documents which have not survived in any other form.&lt;ref name="stump_225"&gt;Stump, p.&amp;nbsp;225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of content, Tschudi is particularly interested in representing the long-established independence of the [[Swiss]] population.&lt;ref name="potter_39"/&gt; Furthermore, Tschudi makes mention of the struggle between [[Investiture Controversy|empire and papacy]], the [[crusades]], and a large number of other issues concerning Swiss cities, dioceses and monasteries.&lt;ref name="potter_39"/&gt;

Furthermore, Tschudi’s ''Chronicon Helveticum'' contains much valuable material for the study of the [[William Tell]] legend.&lt;ref name="bergier_21"&gt;Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probably due to these circumstances that Tschudi’s ''Chronicon Helveticum'' became a model for later writers dealing with William Tell. Not only did Tschudi’s chronicle become the major source for [[Johannes von Müller]]’s ''[[History of the Swiss Confederation]]'' (German: ''Geschichten Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft''), it also served as a model for [[Friedrich Schiller]]’s play ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]''.&lt;ref name="bergier_16"&gt;Bergier, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flat vs. threaded===
* A '''flat''' forum is one where each message is added onto the end of the discussion, with no set relation to any prior messages (other than being on the same discussion topic &amp;mdash; except in case of [[Off-topic|Off-Topic]] posting). But, there is normally a feature to 'quote' another user's post, to allow referencing back to other posts.
* A '''[[Threaded discussion|threaded]]''' forum is one where users can specify their message is a reply to an existing message. Threaded forums can display relationships between message topics and associated replies, such as by [[Indentation (typesetting)|indenting]] replies and placing them below the post they reference. Threaded forums are most commonly used for discussions where individual messages tend to be short, such as on [[social news]] sites (e.g. [[Slashdot]] or [[reddit]]), or in commenting systems like [[Disqus]].

===User-selectable themes===
Most forums provide an option for the forum owner to customize the look and feel. Some forums also allow the administrator to create multiple styles or themes, and allow the user to choose which one they wish to view. Themes may simply be a different set of colors and graphics, or they may involve a different layout to the forum, such as one optimized for [[Mobile browser|small-screen device]]s.

The comparison table shows whether a forum software allows forum administrators to customise the "template" of the forum (or specific sections thereof) without altering the released code. Support is considered partial where it's only possible to add CSS rules in this way.&lt;ref name=forummatrix/&gt;

===Unread message tracking===
Unread message tracking refers to the way that is used by forum software to track and display messages that have not yet been read by the current user. This can be one of the following:
* '''Session''' — when a user's session starts, this method relies on the user's "last visit time" to display all messages created since that date as unread. Everything that was posted before "last visit time" is considered "read" regardless of whether the user has actually seen it or not. Until the user's session expires, this method properly tracks read/unread messages, starting with messages that were selected as "unread" when the user's session started. This method is broadly used, due to the simplicity and speed benefits of only storing and checking against a single database value.
* '''Full''' — forum software which records in the persistent database what messages have been read or unread by each user, regardless of user session expiration. Some forum software also allows the user to 'mark as unread', so that they can come back to a message later.

=== Export, portability ===

This column judges the ability to allow users to export data from the forum installation and then import it in new installations of the same software (cf. [[right to fork]]) or feed it to data conversion tools.

[[Software portability]] is a key assessment criterion for the choice and procurement of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fsfe.org/activities/policy/eu/digital-single-market-comments.en.html|title=FSFE's Comments on the EU Digital Single Market Strategy|work=FSFE - Free Software Foundation Europe|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Email]]/[[NNTP]] interface===

Whether the software can be used with standard [[Email]] or [[NNTP]] clients. Adoption of standard protocols is key for [[interoperability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/78891/Review-of-the-Evidence_CIPPM.pdf|title=Open Standards in Government IT: A Review of the Evidence|author=Centre for Intellectual Property &amp; Policy Management at Bournemouth University|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===

Whether the [[internationalization and localization]] of the software are sufficient to both allow and actually provide grammatically correct support for the native language of the target users.&lt;ref name="SFW"&gt;{{cite book|title=Software Without Frontiers: A multi-platform, multi-cultural, multi-nation approach|isbn=9780471969747|editors=Patrick A.V. Hall, Martyn A. Ould|others=With contributions and leadership by Ray Hudson, Costas Spyropoulos, Timo Honkela et al.|publisher=Wiley|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of this table, we consider languages used by an amount of installations/users equal to at least 1% of the top million web properties using that software,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trends.builtwith.com/cms/forum-software|title=Forum Software technologies Web Usage Statistics|website=trends.builtwith.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; without major reported bugs in support.

=== Single sign-on ===

[[Single sign-on]] is often required to enhance web accessibility of the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=S.|last1=Za|first2=E.|last2=D’Atri|first3=A.|last3=Resca|title=Single Sign-On in Cloud Computing Scenarios: A Research Proposal|url=http://eprints.luiss.it/1141/1/CloudComputing_post_print.pdf|publisher=Physica-Verlag HD|journal=Information Technology and Innovation Trends in Organizations|date=1 January 2011|isbn=9783790826319|pages=45–52|doi=10.1007/978-3-7908-2632-6_6|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be accomplished with standards like [[OAuth]] and [[OpenID]].

== Other features ==



===Duplicate thread prevention===

Automatic recommendation systems based on content and users can help forum users find existing discussions similar to those they're browsing or on the topic they're searching,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jun|last1=Zhao|first2=Jiajun|last2=Bu|first3=Chun|last3=Chen|first4=Ziyu|last4=Guan|title=Learning a User-thread Alignment Manifold for Thread Recommendation in Online Forum|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1871437.1871511|publisher=ACM|journal=Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management|date=2010-01-01|location=New York, NY, USA|isbn=9781450300995|pages=559–568|series=CIKM '10|doi=10.1145/1871437.1871511|first5=Can|last5=Wang|first6=Cheng|last6=Zhang}}&lt;/ref&gt; or else reach the correct users with their posts, avoiding to "spam" the forum with duplicate or off-topic posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Yung-Ming|last1=Li|first2=Tzu-Fong|last2=Liao|first3=Cheng-Yang|last3=Lai|title=A social recommender mechanism for improving knowledge sharing in online forums|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457312000234|journal=Information Processing &amp; Management|date=2012-09-01|pages=978–994|volume=48|series=Large-Scale and Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval|issue=5|doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2011.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many users do not bother to search a forum and directly create new threads to seek an answer to a question. On some forums, when the user types a new thread subject, the forum software brings up similar threads automatically on the side. This helps keep the number of redundant threads (or the overall forum pollution) to a lower level as users who neglect to search for a topic and are posting a thread may find the answer to their question as they are creating the new thread.

===[[Forum spam]] defenses===
Most forums are at risk of continuous attack by forum spammers, largely promoting websites with no relevance to the forum's niche. Systems vary in how they are geared to defense, and checking the offering is an important consideration before selection. A forum cannot succeed unless there is an effective system of defense, and an efficient set of tools for spam removal.

[[CAPTCHA]]s are a common feature used among most internet forum software and are often used to prevent automated registrations.

Banning or deleting membership should come as standard, with the ability to blacklist the username, email address or [[IP address]] for variable time spans.

Reference to an anti-forum spam database can be built into the forum software, or offered as add-ons for specific databases.

===User-friendly URLs===
{{main article|Semantic URL}}
Human-friendly forum URLs do not have a [[query string]] and instead contain only the path of the topic. A user-unfriendly URL may contain cryptic parameters, numeric IDs, or file type extensions (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;.php&lt;/tt&gt;) that do not matter to the user and could change if the forum is reimplemented using a different programming language. User-friendly URLs are easy to remember and to type, and may enhance [[search engine optimization]] (SEO).
* user-unfriendly URL example: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com/forum/index.php?t=rview&amp;th=120029&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
* user-friendly URL example: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com/usability-issues/user-friendly-urls&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

In general this is accomplished via [[URL mapping]], however, historically in many forum software packages, human-friendly URLs are an afterthought implemented via [[URL rewriting]], and URLs often contain a numeric ID which represents the thread, while the remainder of the URL can in reality be any string: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com/forum/12345/lets-use-friendly-urls&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com/forum/12345/bogus-path-actually&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; point to the same thread, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.com/forum/12345/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

The only non-controversial counter-argument to using user-friendly URLs is that they would be leaked in the [[HTTP referer]] header field when a user clicks on an external link from a post, which is undesirable for private (sub)forums, since a URL derived from the topic title could convey sensitive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frèrejean|first=Erik|title=SEO URLs|url=http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=218091#p218091|work=phpBB "Arsia" 3.2 Development|publisher=Area51 phpBB|accessdate=2011-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue can be resolved by rewriting external links to point to a redirection page that performs [[HTTP referer#Referer hiding|referer hiding]].

The '''Credit Rating Agency Reform Act''' is a United States federal law whose goal is to improve ratings quality for the protection of [[investors]] and in the public interest by fostering accountability, transparency, and competition in the [[credit rating agency]] industry.&lt;ref name="govtrack1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sen. Richard Shelby [R-AL] |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s3850#overview |title=Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (2006; 109th Congress S. 3850) |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=March 1, 2013}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enacted after being signed by President Bush on September 29, 2006,&lt;ref name="govtrack1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; it amended the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] to require [[nationally recognized statistical rating organization]]s (NRSROs) to register with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marie Leone |url=http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/7991492/c_7989907 |title=Bush Signs Rating Agency Reform Act |publisher=CFO.com |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sen.

Critics had complained that the dominance of "the big three" rating agencies – [[Standard_%26_Poor's#Credit_ratings|Standard &amp; Poor’s Ratings Services]], [[Moody's Investors Service]] and the smaller [[Fitch Ratings|Fitch Rating]]—were in part responsible for the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2006–8.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; The agencies rated 98% of the trillions of dollars of home-mortgage oriented "structured investment" products. Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of securities given the agencies highest—triple-A – rating were later downgraded to "junk" status,&lt;ref&gt;$300 billion [[collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs) issued in 2005–2007 (over half of the CDOs by value during that time period) that rating agencies gave their highest "triple-A" rating to, were written-down to "junk" by the end of 2009. (source:{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report |year=2011 |publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States |pages=228–9 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McLean p.111"&gt;[[Bethany McLean|McLean, Bethany]] and [[Joe Nocera]].

The Act permitted smaller, newer credit rating agencies to register as “statistical ratings organizations".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="illinois1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheeringa |first=Daniel |url=https://publish.illinois.edu/illinoisblj/2011/03/29/dodd-frank-credit-rating-agency-reform-in-the-crosshairs/ |title=Dodd-Frank Credit Rating Agency Reform in the Crosshairs |publisher=Illinois Business Law Journal |date= |accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent of the U.S. Congress was to increase the choice for consumers by opening the market to a greater number of ratings agencies, and also to incent accurate and reliable ratings.&lt;ref name="accountingweb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="illinois1"/&gt;

==Effectiveness of act==
However, in the 12 months that ended in June 2011, the SEC found the big three still issued 97% of all credit ratings, down from 98% in 2007.&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Greg|title=Industry wrote provision that undercuts credit-rating overhaul |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/08/07/198739/industry-wrote-provision-that.html#.Uidbt6ypeSo|accessdate=4 September 2013|newspaper=McClatchy|date=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2013/08/07/18/16/15IKTY.La.91.jpg Status quo for rating agencies] (chart of percentage of outstanding credit ratings reported to the SEC 2007 and 2011; and Moody's revenue and income 1996, 2000, 2010, 2012)| mcclatchydc.com&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Newspapers]] found that "little competition has emerged in rating the kinds of complex home-mortgage securities whose implosion led to the 2007 financial crisis".&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;

Critics have complained that the criteria to designate a rating agency as "a nationally recognized statistical rating organization” was written by a "yet-to-be-identified official of one of the big three ratings agencies" and is so difficult it has "prevented at least one potential competitor from winning approval and have dissuaded others from even applying".&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;  According to critics, the law has set "odd barriers that are very favorable to the incumbents,” made it “exceptionally difficult for a younger player to qualify” as a SEC recognized agency, and “absolutely slammed the door on any new competition” in structured products – “the most lucrative part of the ratings business”.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;

'''''Current Contents''''' is a rapid alerting service database from [[Clarivate Analytics]], formerly the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] and [[Thomson Reuters]]. It is published online and in several different printed subject sections.

==History==
''Current Contents'' was first published in paper format, in a single edition devoted only to biology and medicine. Other subject editions were added later. Initially, it consisted simply of a reproduction of the title pages from several hundred major [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]]s, and was published weekly, with the issues containing title pages from journal issues only a few weeks previously, a shorter time lag than any service then available. There was an author index and a crude keyword subject index only. Author addresses were provided so readers could send reprint requests for copies of the actual articles.

==Current status==
Still published in print, it is available as one of the databases included in Clarivate Analytics' [[ISI Web of Knowledge]] with daily updates, and also through other database aggregators.

===Editions===
The ''Current Contents'' published editions are as follows.

*''Current Contents Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Sciences''
*''Current Contents Arts and Humanities''
*''Current Contents Clinical Practice''
*''Current Contents Engineering, Technology, and Applied  Sciences''
*''Current Contents Life Sciences''
*''Current Contents Physical Chemical and Earth Sciences''
*''Current Contents Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences''

==Current Contents Collections==

''Current Contents Collections'' is issued as two different editions. These are the ''Electronics and Telecommunications Collection'' and the ''Business Collection''. These collections index scholarly journals, trade publications, as well as business and industry related publications. &lt;ref name=CCc/&gt;  

The ''Business Collection'' indexes about 240 journals and trade publications relevant to business administration and management theory and practice. Coverage includes the general subject areas of Business, Economics, Employee Relations, Human Resources, Management, Organization, Marketing, and Business Communication.  &lt;ref name=CCc/&gt; 

The ''Electronics and Telecommunications Collection'' indexes about 210 journals and trade publications relevant to research and developed technology   that pertains to the electronics industry. Coverage includes the general subject areas of Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Optics, Laser Research, Laser Technology, Semiconductors, Solid State Materials Technology, and Telecommunications Technology. &lt;ref name=CCc&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14644">The '''Cutter Expansive Classification''' system is a [[library classification]] system devised by [[Charles Ammi Cutter]]. The system was the basis for the top categories of the [[Library of Congress Classification]].&lt;ref&gt;LaMontagne, Leo E. ''American Library Classification: With Special Reference to the Library of Congress''. Hamden, CT, Shoe String Press. 1961, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Expansive Classification==
[[Charles Ammi Cutter]] (1837&amp;ndash;1903), inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary [[Melvil Dewey]], and with Dewey's initial encouragement, developed his own classification scheme for the Winchester Town Library and then the [[Boston Athenaeum]],&lt;ref&gt;LaMontagne, Leo E. ''American Library Classification: With Special Reference to the Library of Congress''. Hamden, CT, Shoe String Press. 1961, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; at which he served as librarian for twenty-four years. He began work on it around the year 1880, publishing an overview of the new system in 1882. The same classification would later be used, but with a different notation, also devised by Cutter, at the [[Cary Memorial Library|Cary Library]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Cutter, C. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891–93, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many libraries found this system too detailed and complex for their needs, and Cutter received many requests from librarians at small libraries who wanted the classification adapted for their collections. He devised the Expansive Classification in response, to meet the needs of growing libraries, and to address some of the complaints of his critics.&lt;ref&gt;For the Expansive Classification as a response to Cutter's critics, see: Miksa, Francis L., ed. ''Charles Ammi Cutter: Library Systematizer". Littleton, CO, Libraries Unlimited. 1977, p. 58.
* For the Expansive Classification as a response to the growing needs of libraries, see Miksa, above, and also: LaMontagne, Leo E. ''American Library Classification: With Special Reference to the Library of Congress''. Hamden, CT, Shoe String Press. 1961, p. 209.
* The above issues are also discussed by Cutter in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891–93.
&lt;/ref&gt; Cutter completed and published an introduction and schedules for the first six classifications of his new system ([https://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']), but his work on the seventh was interrupted by his death in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;LaMontagne, Leo E. ''American Library Classification: With Special Reference to the Library of Congress''. Hamden, CT, Shoe String Press. 1961, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cutter Expansive Classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, mostly in [[New England]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winke|first1=R. Conrad|title=The Contracting World of Cutter's Expansive Classification|journal=Library Resources &amp; Technical Services|date=2004|volume=48|issue=2|page=123|url=https://journals.ala.org/index.php/lrts/article/viewFile/5419/6654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Library historian Leo E. LaMontagne writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cutter produced the best classification of the nineteenth century. While his system was less "scientific" than that of [[J. P. Lesley]], its other key features – notation, specificity, and versatility – make it deserving of the praise it has received.&lt;ref&gt;LaMontagne, Leo E. ''American Library Classification: With Special Reference to the Library of Congress''. Hamden, CT, Shoe String Press. 1961, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Its top level divisions served as a basis for the [[Library of Congress classification]], which also took over some of its features.&lt;ref&gt;LaMontagne, Leo E. ''American Library Classification: With Special Reference to the Library of Congress''. Hamden, Connecticut, Shoe String Press. 1961, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not catch on as did Dewey's system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;https://journals.ala.org/index.php/lrts/article/view/5419/6654&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the Expansive Classification==
The Expansive Classification uses seven separate schedules, each designed to be used by libraries of different sizes. After the first, each schedule was an expansion of the previous one,&lt;ref&gt;Miksa, Francis L., ed. ''Charles Ammi Cutter: Library Systematizer". Littleton, CO, Libraries Unlimited. 1977, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cutter provided instructions for how a library might change from one expansion to another as it grows.&lt;ref&gt;Cutter, C. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891–93, p. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of the Expansive Classification schedules==

===First classification===
The first classification is meant for only the very small libraries. The first classification has only seven top level classes, and only eight classes in all.

* '''A''' Works of reference and general works which include several of the following sections, and so could not go in any one.
* '''B''' [[Outline of philosophy|Philosophy]] and [[Outline of religion|Religion]]
* '''E''' Biography
* '''F''' [[Outline of history|History]] and [[Outline of geography|Geography]] and Travels
* '''H''' [[Outline of social science|Social sciences]]
* '''L''' [[Outline of natural science|Natural sciences]] and [[The arts|Arts]]
* '''Y''' [[Outline of linguistics|Language]] and [[Outline of literature|Literature]]
* '''YF''' [[Outline of fiction|Fiction]]

===Further classifications===
Further expansions add more top level classes and subdivisions. Many subclasses arranged systematically, with common divisions, such as those by geography and language, following a consistent system throughout.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/cu31924092476229&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fifth classification all the letters of the alphabet are in use for top level classes. These are:

* '''A''' General Works
* '''B''' [[Outline of philosophy|Philosophy]]
* '''C''' [[Outline of Christianity|Christianity]] and [[Outline of Judaism|Judaism]]
* '''D''' Ecclesiastical History
* '''E''' Biography
* '''F''' [[Outline of history|History]], Universal History
* '''G''' [[Outline of geography|Geography]] and Travels
* '''H''' [[Outline of social science|Social Sciences]]
* '''I''' Demotics, [[Outline of sociology|Sociology]]
* '''J''' Civics, Government, [[Outline of political science|Political Science]]
* '''K''' Legislation
* '''L''' [[Outline of science|Science]] and [[The arts|Arts]] together
* '''M''' Natural History
* '''N''' [[Outline of botany|Botany]]
* '''O''' [[Outline of zoology|Zoology]]
* '''P''' [[Outline of anthropology|Anthropology]] and Ethnology
* '''Q''' [[Outline of medicine|Medicine]]
* '''R''' Useful arts, [[Outline of technology|Technology]]
* '''S''' Constructive arts ([[Outline of engineering|Engineering]] and [[Outline of construction|Building]])
* '''T''' [[Outline of manufacturing|Manufactures]] and Handicrafts
* '''U''' [[Outline of military science and technology|Art of War]]
* '''V''' Recreative arts, [[Outline of sports|Sports]], [[Outline of games|Games]], [[Outline of festivals|Festivals]]
* '''W''' [[Outline of the visual arts|Art]]
* '''X''' English Language
* '''Y''' English and American literature
* '''Z''' Book arts

These schedules were not meant to be fixed, but were to be adapted to meet the needs of each library. For example, books on the English language may be put in X, and books on language in general in a subclass of X, or this can be reversed. The first option is less logical, but results in shorter marks for most English language libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Cutter, C. A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L10oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications'']. Boston, C. A. Cutter. 1891–93, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How Expansive Classification call numbers are constructed==
{{Expand section|citations and corrections|date=August 2011}}
Most call numbers in the Expansive Classification follow conventions offering clues to the book's subject. The first line represents the subject, the second the author (and perhaps title), the third and fourth dates of editions, indications of translations, and critical works on particular books or authors. All numbers in the Expansive Classification are (or should be) shelved as if in decimal order.

Size of volumes is indicated by points (.), pluses (+), or slashes (/ or //).

For some subjects a numerical geographical subdivision follows the classification letters on the first line. The number 83 stands for the United States&amp;mdash;hence, F83 is U.S. history, G83 U.S. travel, JU83 U.S. politics, WP83 U.S. painting. Geographical numbers are often further expanded decimally to represent more specific areas, sometimes followed by a capital letter indicating a particular city.

The second line usually represents the author's name by a capital letter plus one or more numbers arranged decimally. This may be followed by the first letter or letters of the title in lower-case, and/or sometimes the letters a, b, c indicating other printings of the same title. When appropriate, the second line may begin with a 'form' number&amp;mdash;e.g., 1 stands for history and criticism of a subject, 2 for a bibliography, 5 for a dictionary, 6 for an atlas or maps, 7 for a periodical, 8 for a society or university publication, 9 for a collection of works by different authors.

On the third line a capital Y indicates a work about the author or book represented by the first two lines, and a capital E (for English&amp;mdash;other letters are used for other languages) indicates a translation into English. If both criticism and translation apply to a single title, the number expands into four lines.

=== Cutter numbers (Cutter codes) ===
{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=August 2011}}
One of the features adopted by other systems, including Library of Congress, is the Cutter number. It is an alphanumeric device to code text so that it can be arranged in alphabetical order using the fewest characters. It contains one or two initial letters and Arabic numbers, treated as a decimal. To construct a Cutter number, a cataloguer consults a Cutter table as required by the classification rules.  Although Cutter numbers are mostly used for coding the names of authors, the system can be used for titles, subjects, geographic areas, and more.

{| class=wikitable
|+Cutter table
|-
! || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9
|-
| S || a || ch || e || h–i || m–p || t || u || w–z
|-
| Qu || || a || e || i || o || r || t || y
|-
| other consonants || || a || e || i || o || r || u || y
|-
| vowels || b || d || l–m || n || p || r || s–t || u–y
|-
| additional letters || || a–d || e–h || i–l || m–o || p–s || t–v || w–z
|}

Initial letters Qa–Qt are assigned Q2–Q29, while entries beginning with numerals have a Cutter number A12–A19, therefore sorting before the first A entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LC Cutter Tables |url=http://staff.library.mun.ca/staff/toolbox/tables/lccutter.htm |website=Queen Elizabeth II Libraries |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland |accessdate=14 August 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814173419/http://staff.library.mun.ca/staff/toolbox/tables/lccutter.htm |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

So to make the three digit Cutter number for "Cutter", you would start with "C", then looking under ''other consonants'', find that "u" gives the number 8, and under ''additional letters'', "t" is 8, giving a Cutter number of "C88".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10565">'''Cybersquatting''' (also known as '''domain squatting'''), according to the United States federal law known as the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]], is registering, trafficking in, or using an [[Domain name|Internet domain name]] with [[bad faith]] intent to profit from the goodwill of a [[trademark]] belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.

The term is derived from "[[squatting]]", which is the act of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied space or building that the squatter does not own, rent, or otherwise have permission to use.

==Legal resolution==
Some countries have specific laws against cybersquatting beyond the normal rules of trademark law. The [[United States]], for example, has the U.S. Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) of 1999. This expansion of the Lanham (Trademark) Act (15 U.S.C.) is intended to provide protection against cybersquatting for individuals as well as owners of distinctive trademarked names. However, even notable personalities, including rock star [[Bruce Springsteen]] and actor [[Kevin Spacey]], failed to obtain control of their names on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/11/26/kevin_spacey_loses_pivotal_cybersquatting/ |title=Kevin Spacey loses pivotal cybersquatting court case |website=Theregister.co.uk |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdiction is an issue, as shown in the case involving Kevin Spacey, in which Judge Gary A. Feess, of the United States District Court of the Central District of California, ruled that the actor would have to file a complaint in a Canadian court, where the current owner of kevinspacey.com resided. Spacey later won the domain through the [[Forum (alternative dispute resolution)]] f.k.a [[National Arbitration Forum]].

===International===
Since 1999, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) has provided an arbitration system wherein a trademark holder can attempt to claim a squatted site. In 2006, there were 1823 complaints filed with WIPO, which was a 25% increase over the 2005 rate.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|title=U.N: Cybersquatting complaints rise |publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Social media==
With the rising of social media websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], a new form of cybersquatting involves registering trademark-protected brands or names of public figure
on popular social media websites.

On June 5, 2009, [[Tony La Russa]], the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, filed a complaint against Twitter, accusing Twitter of cybersquatting.&lt;ref name=Russa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/la-russa-v-twitter-inc |title='&amp;#39;see'&amp;#39;La Russa Complaint, La Russa v. Twitter, Inc., No. CGC-09-488101, 2009 WL 1569936 |publisher=Citmedialaw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute centered on a Twitter profile that used La Russa's name, had a picture of La Russa, and had a headline that said "Hey there! Tony La Russa is now using Twitter." The profile encouraged users to "join today to start receiving Tony La Russa's updates." According to La Russa, the status updates were vulgar and derogatory. La Russa argued that the author of the profile intended, in bad faith, to divert Internet traffic away from La Russa's website and make a profit from the injury to La Russa's mark.&lt;ref name=Russa/&gt; On June 26, 2009, La Russa filed a notice of voluntary dismissal after the parties settled the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/la-russa-v-twitter-inc |title='&amp;#39;see'&amp;#39;La Russa Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, La Russa v. Twitter, Inc., No. CGC-09-488101, 2009 WL 1569936 |publisher=Citmedialaw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efforts to curtail cybersquatting in social media===
Social networking websites have attempted to curb cybersquatting, making cybersquatting a violation of their terms of service.

====Twitter====
Twitter's name squatting policy forbids the cybersquatting as seen in many domain name disputes, like "username for sale" accounts: "Attempts to sell or extort other forms of payment in exchange for usernames will result in account suspension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.twitter.com/forums/26257/entries/18370 |title=Twitter Support: Name Squatting Policy |publisher=Help.twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Twitter has an "Impersonation Policy" that forbids non-parody impersonation. An account may be guilty of impersonation if it confuses or misleads others; "accounts with the clear intent to confuse or mislead may be permanently suspended." Twitter's standard for defining parody is whether a reasonable person would be aware that the fake profile is a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.twitter.com/forums/26257/entries/18366 |title=Twitter Support: Impersonation Policy |publisher=Help.twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, soon after the La Russa suit was filed, Twitter took another step to prevent "identity confusion" caused by squatting by unveiling "Verified Accounts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/help/verified |title=About verified accounts &amp;#124; Twitter Help Center |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usernames stamped with the "verified account" insignia indicate that the accounts are real and authentic.

====Facebook====
Facebook reserves the right to reclaim usernames on the website if they infringe on a trademark.&lt;ref name=facebook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/help/usernames |title=Help Center, FACEBOOK |publisher=Facebook.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trademark owners are responsible for reporting any trademark infringement on a username infringement form Facebook provides. Furthermore, Facebook usernames require "mobile phone authentication".&lt;ref name=facebook/&gt; In order to obtain a username, the individual needs to verify the account by phone.

'''''Deutsches Kolonial-Lexikon''''' is the German title for the '''''Encyclopedia of German colonies''''' which was published in 1920. The text had been finished by 1914 before [[World War I]] but was not printed due to the war. Thus it gives a wide range of information and then official views on the [[German colonial empire|colonies of Germany]] at the end of its rule.

The encyclopedia was published 1920 in three volumes by a committee headed by the former [[Governor of German East Africa|governor]] of [[German East Africa]], [[Heinrich Schnee]]. It was reprinted in 2006 by [[Fines Mundi]] publishers in [[Saarbrücken]].

The complete German text has been digitalized and is available online.

A '''face book''' or '''facebook''' is a printed or [[web directory]] found at some [[Lists of American institutions of higher education|American universities]] consisting of individuals’ photographs and names. In particular, it denotes publications of this type distributed by university administrations at the start of the academic year, with the intention of helping students get to know each other.

==History==
[[Colleges]] and [[university|universities]] in the United States have often published official or unofficial books listing their students, [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], or staff, together with pictures and limited biographical data.&lt;ref name="PU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103202590.html |accessdate=August 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611025730/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103202590.html |archivedate=June 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 2000s, some face books were being published online offering a number of new features, including password protection, more detailed information, more advanced indexing and searching, and the ability for people to upload and enter information and photographs.&lt;ref name="PU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crimson"&gt;{{cite news|work=Harvard Crimson|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/|date=2004-02-09|title=Hundreds Register for New Facebook Website|author=Alan J. Tabak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2004, [[Mark Zuckerberg]], a [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] at [[Harvard University]], created an unofficial online face book at the website "thefacebook.com", the forerunner of the [[Facebook]] service, out of frustration that the university's official online face book project was taking too long.&lt;ref name="Crimson"/&gt; The development of a campus-wide face book had previously been stalled by privacy concerns, many of which became prominent in November 2003 when Zuckerberg was accused of breaching security and violating copyrights and individual privacy. Zuckerberg had created a website, www.facemash.com, that used photos taken without authorization from [[Harvard House]]-based face books, using the photos in a system to rate the attractiveness of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=College Inches Toward Campus-Wide Facebook; Time frame for completion of online directory still uncertain |author=David M.

'''''Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible''''' was a five-volume Biblical encyclopaedia published 1898–1904.

==First edition==
The full title was ''A Dictionary of the Bible, dealing with the Language, Literature and Contents, including the Biblical Theology''. It was edited by [[James Hastings]], with the assistance of [[John A. Selbie]]. Additional assistance with revision of the proofs was provided by [[Andrew B. Davidson|A. B. Davidson]], [[Samuel Rolles Driver|S. R. Driver]] and [[Henry Barclay Swete|H. B. Swete]]. Four volumes (1898&amp;mdash;1902) divided up the alphabetic entries, with a fifth volume (1904) devoted to some extra articles, indexes and maps. Publication was by [[T. &amp; T. Clark]] in Edinburgh and [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] in New York.

Although described as a “dictionary”, the work is better described as an encyclopaedia, with signed articles sometimes several pages in length. It is a substantial work, with five [[Book size|quarto]] volumes each of about 900 pages. The 194 authors of articles were established scholars of the day, generally Protestant Christians, from many countries, but mostly from the UK and the USA in that order.

The subject matter was "the Old and New Testaments, together with the Old Testament Apocrypha, according to the [[Authorized Version|Authorized]] and [[Revised Version|Revised English Version]]s." Articles were written "on names of all Persons and Places, on the Antiquities and Archaeology of the Bible, on its Ethnology, Geology and Natural History, on Biblical Theology and Ethic ..."

It remains a good source of Biblical information as understood around 1900.

==1909 edition==
A one-volume dictionary with the same name was issued by the same publishers in 1909. It was described as "not a condensation of the five-volume set, but new and independent work". The editor was James Hastings, with the co-operation of John A. Selbie, and with the assistance of [[John C. Lambert]] and [[Shailer Mathews]].
992 pages + xvi + 4 maps.

==1963 edition==
A completely up-dated and revised one-volume edition was written by 148 scholars, edited by [[Frederick C. Grant]] and [[H. H. Rowley]] and issued by the same publishers in 1963. 1059 pages + maps.

[[File:Jean-Georges Noverre.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Jean-Georges Noverre&lt;br /&gt;([[Jean-Baptiste Perronneau|Perronneau]], 1764, [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]])&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Jean-Georges Noverre''' (29 April 1727 {{snd}} 19 October 1810) was a French dancer and [[balletmaster]], and is generally considered the creator of ''[[ballet d'action]]'', a precursor of the [[narrative ballet]]s of the 19th century. His birthday is now observed as [[International Dance Day]].

His first professional appearances occurred as a youth in Paris at the [[Opéra-Comique]], at [[Fontainebleau]], in Berlin before [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] and his brother [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726-1802)|Prince Henry of Prussia]], in [[Dresden]] and [[Strasbourg|Strasburg]]. In 1747 he moved to Strasbourg, where he remained until 1750 before moving to Lyon. In 1751, he composed his first great work, ''Les Fêtes Chinoises'' for Marseilles. The work was revived in Paris in 1754 to great acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In 1755, he was invited by [[David Garrick|Garrick]] to London, where he remained for two years.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|title=Noverre, Jean Georges|volume=19|page=839|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/839/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1758 and 1760 he produced several ballets at [[Lyon]], and published his ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Lettres sur la danse et les ballets|fr|3=Lettres sur la danse}}''. It is from this period that the revolution in the art of the ballet for which Noverre was responsible can be dated. Prior to Noverre, ballets were large spectacles that focused mainly on elaborate costumes and scenery and not on the physical and emotional expression of the dancers. He was next engaged by [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg|Duke Karl Eugen of Württemberg]], and later Austrian [[Empress Maria Theresa]], until 1774. In 1776, he was appointed ''maître des ballets'' of the Paris Opera at the request of Queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. He returned to Vienna in Spring of 1776 to stage ballets there, but in June 1776 he returned again to Paris. He regained this post until the [[French Revolution]] reduced him to poverty. He died on 19 October 1810 at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
[[File:Three dancers MET DP-12395-001 (cropped).jpg|thumb|''Pas-de-trois'' in [[Ludwigsburg porcelain]], c. 1763, one of a series of groups probably directly taken from Noverre's ballets]]

Noverre's friends included [[Voltaire]], [[Mozart]], [[Frederick the Great]] and [[David Garrick]] (who called him "the [[Shakespeare]] of the dance"). The ballets of which he was most proud were his ''La Toilette de Vénus'', ''Les Jalousies du sérail'', ''L'Amour corsaire'' and ''Le Jaloux sans rival''. Besides the ''Lettres sur la danse'', Noverre wrote ''Observations sur la construction d'une nouvelle salle de l'Opéra'' (1781); ''Lettres sur Garrick écrites à Voltaire'' (1801); and ''Lettre à un artiste sur les fêtes publiques'' (1801).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Noverre was born in Paris on 29 April 1727 to Marie Anne de la Grange and Jean Louys, a Swiss soldier. The couple expected their son to pursue a military career but the boy chose dance, studying with M. Marcel and then with the famous [[Louis Dupré (dancer)|Louis Dupré]]. Noverre's first professional experience probably occurred at the [[Opéra-Comique]] in Paris on 8 June 1743 in ''Le Coq du village''. In his middle and late teenage years, Noverre performed at [[Fontainebleau]], and in [[Berlin]] before [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] and his brother [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726-1802)|Prince Henry of Prussia]]. Appearances in [[Dresden]] and [[Strasbourg]] followed before his return to the Opéra-Comique. In 1747, Noverre became ballet master in Strasbourg and created his first great success, the exotic ''[[Les Fêtes chinoises]]''. In 1748 in Strasbourg he married the actress Marie-Louise Sauveur.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]]: "»Mademoiselle Jeunehomme« Zur Lösung eines Mozart-Rätsels", ''Mozart Experiment Aufklärung''. Essays for the Mozart Exhibition 2006, (Ostfildern: Hatje Cantz Verlag, Da Ponte-Institut, 2006), 423-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, he became principal dancer in [[Lyon]] and created his first ''ballet-pantomime'', ''Le Jugement de Pâris'' in 1751. Noverre traveled to Vienna, where he worked under Queen [[Maria Theresa]] and became Maître de danse for her twelve-year-old daughter, Marie-Antoinette. Noverre and Marie Antoinette's relationship grew and they became very close. Marie-Antoinette became a patron to Noverre. In early 1754 Noverre produced a frightening and moving scene that disturbed the conservative queen, and he lost his job. He moved to Strasbourg for one year in 1754, and returned to the Opéra-Comique, where ''Les Fêtes'' was staged with great success on 1 July 1754.

In 1755, he went to London with his wife, his sister and brother, and his company. There, he worked with [[David Garrick]] of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]], learning new concepts of theatre and the then-developing natural style of performance. When the London production of ''Les Fêtes chinoises'' was completely destroyed by rioters on the eve of the [[Seven Years' War]], Noverre and his family were forced to go into hiding. He continued to supervise dance spectacles at Drury Lane, but without billing. In 1774 King Louis XV died and Noverre's dear friend Marie-Antoinette became the Queen of France. Marie-Antoinette did not forget about her dear Dance Master, and appointed Noverre to the Paris Opera. This was Noverre's shining moment, but the loyalty and backing of Marie-Antoinette could switch. In 1779 Noverre was unseated from his position because Dauberval, Maximilien Gardel and Mlle Guimard gathered prominent people and poisoned them against Noverre. However, Noverre didn't leave the Opera until 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Guest, Ivor. The Ballet of the Enlightenment: The Establishment of the Ballet D'action in France, 1770–1793. London: Dance, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Noverre's fitting effect on the Paris ballet world would be preserved by the production of his tragic ballet ''Jason et Médée'' in 1763. In 1787, Pierre Gardel inherited the throne and Paris Opera, and carried out Noverre's ideas on costume and thoughts on ballet pantomime. (Chazin-Bennhaum) He composed ''Les Caprices de Galathée'', for example, and garbed his dancers in tiger skins and shoes made of tree bark. His naturalist attitude towards costume placed him in the front rank of the French Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kant|2007|pp=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Context ===
Noverre's treatise on dancing and theater expressed his aesthetic theories on the production of ballets and his method of teaching ballet. Noverre wrote this text in London in 1756 and published it in 1760 in Lyon, France. He began his research for his essays in [[Drury Lane]], London, where he choreographed for his own troupe of dancers at the Theatre Royal under the direction of David Garrick. It was in David Garrick's library that Noverre read modern French literature and ancient Latin treatises on pantomime. Noverre was inspired by the pantomimes that he thought stirred up the audience's emotions by the use of expressive movement. He proclaimed in his text that ballet should unfold through dramatic movement, and the movement should express the relationship between the characters. Noverre named this type of ballet, [[ballet d’action]] or pantomime ballet (International Dictionary of Ballet 1032). From 1757 to 1760, he produced thirteen new works with composer François Granier at the Lyon Opera. His lighter, colorful pantomime ballets like ''Les Caprices de Galathée'', ''La Toilette de Vénus'', and ''Les Jalousies du sérail'', received great success.&lt;ref&gt;Hansell, Kathleen Kuzmick. "Noverre, Jean-Georges." The International Encyclopedia of Dance.:Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference. 2005. Date Accessed 14 Nov. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inspiration ===
Noverre was most immediately influenced by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[David Garrick]], and [[Marie Sallé]]. Rameau was a very influential French composer and music theorist, and Noverre was inspired by his dance music that combined programmatic and strongly individual elements. David Garrick was an actor and theatre director at the Theatre Royal. Noverre was inspired by his talent for "histrionics" and vivid mime work where Noverre wanted to shake from{{clarify|date=September 2018}} the traditional forms of Ballet. (The Encyclopedia of Dance and Ballet 695).

With the content that follows it is imperative to closer examine the profound influence of Marie Sallé on Jean-George Noverre. Sallé and Noverre had an intertwining history that began at the Paris Opera Ballet.  Sallé had studied in Paris with Françoise Prévost, who was a known predecessor of dramatizing ballet with her virtuosic acting and expressive performance.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Dance |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; * Salle had studied in Paris with Francoise Prevost who was an established predecessor of the dramatic style of ballet demonstrated through her virtuosic acting and expressive performances.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;  Sallé made her debut at the Paris Opera in 1727 where she established a reputation for her “delicate grace and expressive mime” abilities.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

Sallé's London season of 1733-34 at Covent Garden saw her two pantomimes—Pygmalion and Bacchus and Ariadne—which were both staged in the spring of 1734.  Additionally, she collaborated with the naturalised British composer George Frideric Handel during his 1734-35 London Opera season during which her pantomimes became a forerunner of Noverre's ballet d'action--.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sarah McCleave |authorlink1=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |editor1-link=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |title=Women’s Work Making Dance in Europe before 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she returned to Paris in 1735, she choreographed and danced in scenes for Jean-Philippe Rameau's Opera-ballets.  Although she retired from the public stage in 1741, she continued to influence the dance community through her coaching and choreographic innovations at Opéra-Comique in 1743, which happens to be when Noverre made his debut.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

Social and economic factors, in what was unequivocally a “man’s world” allowed Noverre to bring forth his ideologies surrounding the evolution of dance. By contrast, the recognition given to Sallé was largely limited to her significance as a performer.  Her role as a creative choreographer, and progressive innovator was not only ignored during her lifetime, but it has failed to have been recognized by historians of the dance arts even to this day. Blanked for her virtuosic movements and expressive talents, Sallé laid the foundations for which Noverre was able to  move forward.  Her choreographic work in Pygmalion brought forth a combination of expressive gestures and dance movements to mediate it's narrative.  Although historians have grappled with the duality of Sallé's role in dance history, it is precisely these aspects that deem her the true inventor of the ballet d'action that was to sweep the late eighteenth-century stage under Noverre's creative efforts and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sarah McCleave |authorlink1=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |editor1-link=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |title=Women’s Work Making Dance in Europe before 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her performance and choreographic work, Sallé worked to create reforms within the rigid ballet world predating Noverre. Sallé revolutionized ballet by her combination of artistic dance movement, the expressive use of gestures matched to the music, and her redesign of costumes and stage scenery in unique ways that broke new ground in the dance world.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;  The simple act of omitting the Mask and the reworking of costumes was later picked up by Noverre in his Les Lettres sur la danse et sur les ballets.   Sallé's shifting public image, influenced the reception of her costume reforms. She was performing at the time when the dancers’ costumes were not realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sarah McCleave |authorlink1=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |editor1-link=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |title=Women’s Work Making Dance in Europe before 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noverre's notion of costume reform clearly stemmed from his association with her. Although he is recognized for his rejection of the dancer's mask, it is most probable that his action would have been motivated by Sallé's “noble, expressive and spiritual countenance,” which inspired particular comment in his Letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sarah McCleave |authorlink1=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |editor1-link=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |title=Women’s Work Making Dance in Europe before 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When contemplating the speed of Noverre's rapid shifts in style, one has to consider all the work Sallé created before him. Given her background and gender—with all its discriminatory limitations—Sallé's achievements were nothing short of incredible. Given the continuing battle for gender equality in the contemporary world of both business and the business of the arts world, her accomplishments are even more extraordinary recognizing that they were done in the 18th century, a time when men held all the most important positions of influence and power in the theatrical world, as well as the political world.  Going against the grain of a woman's role being limited to interpret the dance creations of men, Sallé broke barriers to stage and perform her own creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sarah McCleave |authorlink1=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |editor1-link=“Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence” |title=Women’s Work Making Dance in Europe before 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cannot recognize the work of Noverre's innovations without including the paradigm shifts that grew out of her life and work.

Noverre's text demanded an end to repressive traditions peculiar to the Paris Opera Ballet, such as stereotypical and cumbersome costumes, and old-fashioned musical styles and choreography. Noverre also discussed the methods for training dancers such as encouraging a student to capitalize on his or her own talents (The Encyclopedia of Dance and Ballet 699). Most of Noverre's criticisms of dance in his book were directed towards the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]&lt;ref name="archive.is"&gt;[https://archive.is/20070729054114/http://www.parisoperaballet.com.au/site/gala.html]&lt;/ref&gt; because he felt the Paris Opera Ballet created ballets that were an isolated event within Opera lacking meaningful connection with the main theme of the Opera. He criticized the Paris Opera Ballet&lt;ref name="archive.is"/&gt; use of the mask because it restricted the dancer from showing facial expressions that could bear meaning on their characters. Noverre devoted the whole of his Ninth Letter to the subject of masks and wrote, " Destroy the masks and" he argued, "we shall gain a soul, and be the best dancers in the world."
Noverre specifically dealt with seven major points in his treatise:
# Regarding the training of dancers, he emphasized that correctness in dance technique as laid down by Pierre Beauchamp and others must be held with sensitivity to the individual's anatomy.
# Of prime concern, the [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] consideration of the dancer's personality and style is prerequisite to artistic development.
# Noverre stressed that within a dramatic context, validity and sincerity of gestural expression are of the utmost importance in creating a [[ballet]].
# Noverre called for the logical development of plots. According to Noverre, plots should be thematically integrated with movement. Additionally, all superfluous solos and irrelevant dance techniques should be omitted from the ballet.
# Noverre was adamant that music be appropriately suited to the dramatic development of the plot.
# He insisted that costumes, décor, and lighting be compatible with the introduction, plot, and climax of each act within the ballet.
# With the disappearance of masks in his own ballets, Noverre pronounced his advanced ideas on stage make-up for dancers that would allow for the dancer's expression to be seen rather than hidden behind a mask (Lee 111).

=== Impact ===
Noverre's ''Les Lettres sur la danse et sur les ballets'' had lasting impact on ballet ideology as his text has been printed in almost every European language and his name is one of the most frequently quoted in the literature of dance (Lynham 13). Many of his theories have been implemented in dance classes today and remain a part today's ideology of dance. For example, his idea that a teacher should encourage students to profit from his or her own talents rather than to imitate a teacher or the style of a popular dancer is a present ideology of dance. Noverre did receive criticism from many of his prominent ballet contemporaries, however his theories have survived longer than any of his ballets, which have not been reproduced for at least two centuries (Lynham 127).

=== ''Lettres sur la Danse'' in English ===
''Lettres sur la danse'' was first published in English in 1782, where it was titled ''The Works of Monsieur Noverre translated from the French''. The translator, Parkyns MacMahon, also translated Noverre's ballet ''Adela of Ponthieu'', and was in touch with him while working on ''The Works of Monsieur Noverre''. In 2014, MacMahon's translation was transcribed with commentary by [[Michael Burden]] and Jennifer Thorp, and published with eight essays by dance historians and musicologists as ''The Works of Monsieur Noverre Translated from the French: Noverre, His Circle, and the English'' Lettres sur la Danse (Hillsdale, New York: Pendragon, 2014). Although snippets appear in ''Letters on Dancing and Ballets'' (London: Beaumont, 1930), by [[Cyril Beaumont]], the Burden and Thorp transcription is the only complete English translation.

The essays in the volume, which cover a number of aspects of Noverre's life and career in depth are as follows: Jennifer Thorp: From ''Les fêtes chinoises'' to ''Agamemnon revenged'': Ange Goudar as commentator on the ballets of Jean-Georges Noverre; Samantha Owens: "Just as great as Noverre": the ballet composer Florian Johann Deller (1729–73) and music at the Württemberg court; Kathleen Kuzmick Hansell: Noverre in Milan: a turning point; Adeline Mueller: A peep into Mozart and Le Picq's Serraglio (Milan, 1772): Noverre's tragic reworking of a comic ballet; Edward Nye: Outrageous dancing and respectable Noverre; Bruce Alan Brown: ''Weiß und Rosenfarb'': the end of Noverrian ballet in Vienna and the beginnings of the Wienerischer Musenalmanach; Michael Burden: Regular meetings: Noverre and Gallini in London, 1756-1795; Anna Karin Ståhle: Jean-Georges Noverre applying for jobs.

== The Jean-Georges Noverre bicentenary ==
To mark the bicentenary of the death of Jean-Georges Noverre, two academic meetings were held which explored aspects of biography, dance, and performance.

The first was ‘Celebrating Jean-Georges Noverre 1727-1810: his world, and beyond’, which was the 11th Annual [[Oxford Dance Symposium]] on 16–17 April 2010 at New College, Oxford. Some of the papers were included in Burden and Thorp (2014).

The second was the ‘Colloque International à l’occasion du bicentenaire de la mort de Noverre’, les jeudi 21, vendredi 22 et samedi 23 octobre 2010, A l’initiative de L’Association pour un Centre de recherches sur les Arts du spectacle aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles (ACRAS, société savante), at Centre National de la Danse, 1 rue Victor Hugo – 93500 Pantin, and Maison de la Recherche, 28 rue Serpente, 75006 Paris. The proceedings were published in the ''Revue Musicorum'', X. http://www.revuemusicorum.com/pages/fusebox-short-2-colors_index.html

[[File:HK Britannica Micropedia Ready Reference Index 1-7.JPG|thumb|''Micropædia'' volumes]]
The 12-volume '''''Micropædia''''' is one of the three parts of the [[History of the Encyclopædia Britannica|15th edition]] of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the other two being the one-volume ''[[Propædia]]'' and the 17-volume ''[[Macropædia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bopp|first=Richard E.|title=Reference and Information Services: An Introduction, Fourth Edition|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598848175|page=542|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3fAOcxcNycC&amp;pg=PA542#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Linda C. Smith|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The name ''Micropædia'' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[Mortimer J. Adler]] from the [[Greek language|ancient Greek]] words for "small" and "instruction"; the best English translation is perhaps "brief lessons".

The ''Micropædia'' was introduced in 1974 with 10 volumes having 102,214 short articles, all of which were strictly fewer than 750 words.  This limit was relaxed in the [[History of the Encyclopædia Britannica|major re-organization of the 15th edition]]; many articles were condensed together, resulting in roughly 65,000 articles in 12 volumes.  In general, the 750-word limit is still respected and most articles are only 1-2 paragraphs; however, a few longer articles can be found in the 2007 ''Micropædia'', such as the [[Internet]] entry, which takes up a full page.

With rare exceptions (&lt;3%), the ~65,000 articles of the ''Micropædia'' have no bibliographies and no named contributors. The ''Micropædia'' is intended primarily for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the 700 longer articles of the ''Macropædia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Adler | first = Mortimer J. | authorlink = Mortimer J. Adler | title = Circle of Learning | encyclopedia = The New Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th edition | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] | location = Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; which do have identified authors and bibliographies.

The museum opened to the public in 1957 in a townhouse on at 15 West [[54th Street]] in New York City. [[Robert Goldwater]] (1907–1973) was the museum’s first director.  The museum closed in 1976, and its collections were transferred to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt;

==History==
The initiative for the creation of the Official World Golf Ranking came from the Championship Committee of the [[Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]], which found in the 1980s that its system of issuing invitations to [[The Open Championship]] on a tour by tour basis was omitting an increasing number of top players because more of them were dividing their time between tours, and from preeminent sports agent [[Mark McCormack]], who was the first chairman of the International Advisory Committee which oversees the rankings. The system used to calculate the rankings was developed from [[McCormack's World Golf Rankings]], which were published in his ''World of Professional Golf Annual'' from 1968 to 1985, although these were purely unofficial and not used for any wider purpose (such as inviting players to major tournaments).

The first ranking list was published prior to the 1986 [[Masters Tournament]]. The top six ranked golfers were: [[Bernhard Langer]], [[Seve Ballesteros]], [[Sandy Lyle]], [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]], [[Mark O'Meara]] and [[Greg Norman]]. Thus the top three were all European, but there were 31 Americans in the top 50 (compared with 17 at the end of 2010).

The method of calculation of the rankings has changed considerably over the years. Initially, the rankings were calculated over a three-year period, with the current year's points multiplied by four (three in 1986), the previous year's points by two and the third year's points by one. Rankings were based on the total points and points awarded were restricted to integer values. All tournaments recognised by the world's professional tours, and some leading invitational events, were graded into categories ranging from major championship (whose winners would receive 50 points) to "other tournaments" (whose winners would receive a minimum of 8). In all events, other finishers received points on a diminishing scale that began with runners-up receiving 60% of the winners' points, and the number of players in the field receiving points would be the same as the points awarded to the winner. In a major, for example, all players finishing 30th to 40th would receive 2 points, and all players finishing 50th or higher, 1 point.

Beginning in April 1989, the rankings were changed to be based on the average points per event played instead of simply total points earned, subject to a minimum divisor of 60 (20 events per year). This was in order to more accurately reflect the status of some (particularly older) players, who played in far fewer events than their younger contemporaries but demonstrated in major championships that their ranking was artificially low. Tom Watson, for example, finished in the top 15 of eight major championships between 1987 and 1989, yet had a "total points" ranking of just 40th; his ranking became a more realistic 20th when based on "average points". A new system for determining the "weight" of each tournament was also introduced, based on the strength of the tournament's field in terms of their pre-tournament world rankings. Major championships were guaranteed to remain at 50 points for the winners, and all other events could attain a maximum of 40 points for the winner if all of the world's top 100 were present. In practice most PGA Tour events awarded around 25 points to the winner, European Tour events around 18 and JPGA Tour events around 12.

In 1996, the three-year period was reduced to two years, with the current year now counting double. Points were extended to more of the field, beginning in 2000, and were no longer restricted to integer values. Beginning in September 2001, the tapering system was changed so that instead of the points for each result being doubled if they occurred in the most recent 12 months, one eighth of the initial "multiplied up" value was deducted every 13 weeks. This change effectively meant that players could now be more simply described as being awarded 100 points (not 50) for winning a major. Beginning in 2007, the system holds the points from each event at full value for 13 weeks and then reduces them in equal weekly increments over the remainder of the two-year period.

At first only the Championship Committee of the Royal and Ancient used the rankings for official purposes, but the [[PGA Tour]] recognized them in 1990, and in 1997 all five of the then principal men's golf [[professional golf tours|tours]] did so. The rankings, which had previously been called the '''Sony Rankings''', were renamed the Official World Golf Rankings at that time. They are run from offices in [[Virginia Water]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]].

==Calculation of the rankings==
Source:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/OWGRPT12.pdf Structure of Ranking Points and Rating Values from January 1 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, a golfer's World Ranking is obtained by dividing their ''points total'' by the ''number of events'' they have played, which gives their ''average''. Players are then ranked; a higher average yields a higher rank.

===Event ranking===

The first stage in the calculation is the ranking of each event. For most events the ranking depends on the current world rankings of the participating golfers and the participation of the leading golfers from the "home tour".

A "world rating value" is calculated. Any golfer currently ranked in the world top 200 is given a rating value. The world No. 1 is allocated 45, the No. 2 is allocated 37, the No. 3 is allocated 32, down to those ranked between 101 and 200 who are allocated a rating value of 1 each. The maximum possible world rating value is 925 but this would only happen if all the top 200 golfers were playing.

A "home tour rating value" is calculated. The leading 30 golfers from the previous year's "home tour" are given rating values. Most tours use earnings lists for their top 30, but the PGA Tour currently uses the FedEx points list calculated after the playoffs. [[Men's major golf championships|Major championships]] and [[World Golf Championships|WGC]] events use the current world top 30 list. The home tour No. 1 is allocated 8 down to those from 16 to 30 who are allocated a rating value of 1 each. The maximum home tour rating value is 75 if all the top 30 players from the home tour are competing. The total home tour rating value is limited to 75% of the world rating value.

The world rating value and home tour rating value are added together to give a total rating value. This is then converted into an event ranking using a table. As examples, a total rating value of 10 converts to an event ranking of 8, a total rating value of 100 converts to an event ranking of 24, while a total rating value of 500 converts to an event ranking of 62.

[[Men's major golf championships|Major championships]] have a fixed event ranking of 100 points. For each tour, there is a minimum ranking for each event. In addition, most tours have a "flagship event" that is guaranteed a higher ranking.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Previously the [[Thailand Golf Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thailandgolfchampionship.com/2011/en/tournament/around.php Thailand Golf Championship 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222051054/http://www.thailandgolfchampionship.com/2011/EN/tournament/around.php |date=2011-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2012, several events that previously had not received any points, now do so: Sunshine Tour "Winter Series" – 6 points (72-hole events), 4 points (54-hole events), PGA Tour of Australasia "State Based and Regional Tournaments" – 6 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=6653907&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 |title=Official World Golf Ranking Board Announces Adjustments To Ranking System |date=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925161739/http://www.owgr.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=6653907&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 |archivedate=September 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in July 2015, the four third-tier European tours receive points: 6 points for 72-hole events and 4 points for 54-hole events.&lt;ref name=july2015/&gt; In April 2016, the Korean Tour's minimum was increased from 6 to 9 points and the MENA Golf Tour was added.&lt;ref name=mena&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/news/2016/april/press-release |title=OWGR Board Announcement |publisher=OWGR |date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2018, the Sunshine Tour Big Easy Tour will factor into the World Rankings, making it the 20th professional tour included in the OWGR.&lt;ref name=bet/&gt; For 2018, the European Tour-linked China Tour was added, expanding that total to 21. 

72-hole tournaments which are reduced to 54 holes retain full points, but if a tournament is reduced to 36 holes, its points allocation is reduced by 25%. 54-hole tournaments reduced to 36 holes retain full points.

[[OneAsia Tour]], whose events previously earned a minimum of 6 points, lost its eligibility for world ranking points in 2018.&lt;ref name=oneasia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/news/2018/april/board-announcement |title=Board Announcement |publisher=OWGR |date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''Rank''' refers to the player's world ranking before the event.&lt;/small&gt;

===Player rankings===
Having calculated the ranking of the event, the ranking points of the players for that event can be calculated. The winner's ranking points are the same as the ranking of the event, so that major winners get 100 ranking points. The second place golfer gets 60% of this amount, 40% for 3rd, 30% for 4th, 24% for 5th, down to 14% for 10th, 7% for 20th, 3.5% for 40th to 1.5% for 60th. Players tied for a position share the points for those positions so that if, for example, two players tie for second place they would each receive 50%, the average of 60% and 40%.

A player's ranking points for an event must be at least 1.2. Players who would get less than this using the above formula get no ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th position gets no points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players are guaranteed to receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.

===Adjusted rankings===
For the first 13 weeks after an event the player receives the full ranking points earned in that event. However, from then onwards they are reduced in equal weekly increments over the remainder of a two-year period. This gives priority to recent form. Each week the ranking points are reduced by a factor of 1/92 (approximately 1.09%) so that in week 14 only 98.91% of the ranking points are credited, continuing until week 104 when only 1.09% is credited. From week 105 the ranking points are completely lost.

===Ranking average===
The player's adjusted points for all events in the two-year period are then added together, and this total is divided by the number of events to give the average ranking. However, players are subject to both a minimum and maximum number of events over the two-year period.

If a player competes in fewer than 40 tournaments over the two-year period his adjusted points total is divided by 40 and not the actual number of events he has played in.

In 2010, a maximum number of tournaments was also introduced. The maximum number was initially set to 60 from January 2010 and was reduced by 2 every six months until it reached 52 in January 2012. This means that since 2012 only the player's 52 most recent tournaments (within the two-year period) are used to calculate his ranking average.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120913134247/http://www.owgr.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=6636299&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 Official World Ranking Board Approves Introduction of Maximum Divisor] July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting averages for all players are put into descending order to produce the ranking table. This means that the player who has obtained most cumulative success does not necessarily come top of the rankings: it is ''average'' performance levels that are important, and some golfers play substantially more tournaments than others. New rankings are released every Monday.

==Importance of the rankings==
A professional golfer's ranking is of considerable significance to his career. Currently a ranking in the World Top 50 grants automatic entry to all the [[men's major golf championships|majors]] and [[World Golf Championships]]; see table below. In addition, rankings are the sole criterion for selection for the International Team in the [[Presidents Cup]], while ranking points are one of the qualification criteria for the European [[Ryder Cup]] team. The rankings are also used to help select the field for various other tournaments.

At the 2016 Summer Olympics, the top-15 world-ranked players will be eligible, with a limit of four players from a given country. Beyond the top-15, players will be eligible based on the world rankings, with a maximum of two eligible players from each country that does not already have two or more players among the top-15. Within the 60 players participating, each of the five continents of the Olympic Movement will be guaranteed at least one player and the host nation will be guaranteed one player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympic Games - Qualification System |url=http://www.igfgolf.org/olympic-games/qualification-system/ |publisher=International Golf Federation |accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the major revision of the rating method in September 2001, the highest points average as well as the largest lead in points average were set by [[Tiger Woods]] on September 16, 2007. After winning the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]] and [[The Tour Championship]] in consecutive weeks, he had an average of 24.36 and a lead of 14.73 points over [[Phil Mickelson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/archive/2007/owgr37f2007.pdf OWGR, Week 37, September 16, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tiger Woods]] holds the record for most weeks in the World Top 10, with 860. He is followed by [[Ernie Els]] (788 weeks) and Phil Mickelson (774 weeks). Woods had a record run of 736 consecutive weeks in the top-10 from April 13, 1997 to May 15, 2011 and then had a further run of 124 consecutive weeks in the top-10 from March 25, 2012 to August 3, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golftoday.co.uk/tours/rankings/OWGR_top_10_stats_1.html |title=Official World Golf Ranking - Top Tens |publisher=Golf Today |date=February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf |title=69 Players Who Have Reached the Top-10 in World Ranking |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |date=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=European Tour Official Guide 09 |edition=38th |year=2009 |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |chapter=Players who have reached the Top Ten in the Official World Golf Ranking since 1986 |page=558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of the "number one" ranking==

{{main|List of World Number One male golfers}}
The first official ranking list was published prior to the Masters in April 1986, with [[Bernhard Langer]] the first world No. 1 ranked player, ahead of [[Seve Ballesteros]], who had topped the unofficial [[McCormack's World Golf Rankings]] at the end of the previous year. Ballesteros briefly held the No. 1 spot after Langer, before [[Greg Norman]]'s worldwide success over the rest of that season made him the first year-end No. 1. Ballesteros took the No. 1 position back from Norman in 1987, and the pair exchanged the No. 1 position several times over the next two years. During 1990, [[Nick Faldo]] remained ranked just behind Norman despite winning three majors in two years (and more world ranking points in total than his rival, albeit having entered more events). As detailed in Mark McCormack's "World of Professional Golf 1991" annual, it was also the case (but less immediately apparent) that Norman had won a total of 14 events during the ranking period to Faldo's 10, and when the two had competed in the same tournament, had finished ahead of his rival 19 times to 11, so Norman's No. 1 position (on the new "average points" system) had some justification. Faldo did inherit the No. 1 ranking for the first time early in 1991.

In April 1991, a quirk in the way the rankings treated results from previous years meant that [[Ian Woosnam]], who had never won a major, took the No. 1 spot from Faldo on the eve of the latter's attempt to win the Masters for a third year in succession; as if justifying the ranking system, Woosnam—and not Faldo—won the tournament. Twelve months later, [[Fred Couples]] similarly took over the No. 1 ranking shortly before the 1992 Masters, then also went on to make that tournament his first major victory. Faldo's Open victory in 1992 lifted him back to the No. 1 position, and he held that spot until replaced by [[Nick Price]], who in 1994 became the first African ranked No. 1 after his back-to-back major victories that summer.

By 1996, Greg Norman had regained the top spot and ended 1996 and 1997 narrowly ahead of first [[Tom Lehman]], and then [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Ernie Els]] in the rankings, despite his rivals enjoying major victories in those years while he won none. Lehman, Els and Woods would all briefly become No. 1 during 1997, Lehman for a week – to date, the only player to hold the No. 1 ranking for just one week. In 1996, [[Colin Montgomerie]] also led the rankings in total points earned over the two-year period (but never on average points per event); in 1997 Els was top of a similar "total points" list. Those were the last occasions on which a player led on "total" points but not average points until 2016, when [[Dustin Johnson]] similarly had more points in total than the world number one [[Jason Day]]. Woods then finished 1998 narrowly ahead of [[Mark O'Meara]] even though the latter won two major titles that year while Woods won just once on the PGA Tour. In March 1999, [[David Duval]] became world No. 1 after winning [[The Players Championship]], his sixth victory in a twelve-month period that came before his first major victory (which would follow two years later at the Open Championship).

In 2000, Tiger Woods had an unprecedented season of success that saw him earn 948 world ranking points in a single calendar year, so many points that even had his 1999 points (which represented the previous single-season record) been totally discounted from the calculation, Woods would still have had a points average easily high enough to lead the rankings – and Woods would still have led at the end of 2001 even had he earned no further points that year. Tiger Woods dominated the No. 1 spot for the following five years, but when [[Vijay Singh]] won the [[PGA Championship]] in 2004 and with it took the No. 1 ranking, that change highlighted the fact that Woods had not won a major for over two years, and also the extraordinary success Singh had recently on tour had that had allowed him to overtake the American. Woods responded by winning the very next major, the 2005 Masters, and with it regained the No. 1 spot, which he would then retain for a further five years. Following knee surgery in the summer of 2008, Woods missed the entire second half of the year, while [[Pádraig Harrington]] won two major championships, to add to the Open Championship he won in 2007. Despite earning no further ranking points during his absence, Woods remained No. 1 on the ranking system in December 2008.

During 2010, there was much debate as to whether Woods' continued retention of the No. 1 ranking (which he held up until the end of October) was justified given his relatively poor form—Woods finished fourth in two major championships in 2010, but failed to finish in the top ten of any other events he entered. During the 2010 season, several of his rivals for the No. 1 spot - including Masters champion [[Phil Mickelson]] (who had won four majors since 2004 but had yet to reach No. 1 in the rankings), [[Lee Westwood]] (who had yet to win a major but had finished second in both the Masters and Open Championships in 2010), and then [[Martin Kaymer]] (who had won the PGA Championship among four worldwide wins)— each missed opportunities to win particular events that would have taken them above Woods, before Westwood finally became world No. 1 on October 31.

During 2011, the possession of the No. 1 ranking would be the subject of much discussion among European golf commentators as it passed from Westwood to Kaymer, back to Westwood and then in May to [[Luke Donald]], who took No. 1 spot by defeating Westwood in a playoff for the BMW PGA Championship. Donald, in becoming the fifteenth world No. 1, also became the first ever to reach No. 1 before having won or finished runner-up in a major championship in his career. Donald's position at the top of the rankings was justified by his consistency through the rest of the 2011 season – becoming the first golfer ever to win the money title on both the European and PGA Tours in the same season.

In March 2012, Donald lost the No. 1 position to [[Rory McIlroy]]; the pair then exchanged the No. 1 position a further four times in the following two months, so the volatility of the No. 1 ranking again became a source of comment. At the end of 2012, McIlroy had opened up a clear lead at the top of the rankings, following his second major victory at the PGA Championship and emulating Donald in leading the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic. However, by the end of March 2013, a resurgent Tiger Woods had returned to the top of the rankings, after adding three PGA Tour wins in 2013 to his three victories from 2012 while McIlroy struggled with his form following equipment changes. Woods then suffered a back injury that sidelined him for the early part of 2014, and in his absence, [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]], winner of the 2013 Masters, became the 17th world No. 1 on May 18, despite not winning an event in 2014 to that date; he would win the following week to secure his No. 1 position and avoid following [[Tom Lehman]] as a one-week No. 1. He held the No. 1 position until August 3, when McIlroy regained the top spot by following his Open Championship victory with another at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. Following his second-place finish at the [[2015 PGA Championship]] (that followed earlier wins at the Masters and the U.S. Open), [[Jordan Spieth]] became the 18th world No. 1 on August 16, 2015, describing it as "as good a consolation prize as I've ever had". Over the following three weeks, the No. 1 spot passed back and forth between McIlroy and Spieth, due to the way each player's average points (which were almost identical) fluctuated (as their point weightings and events played divisors changed), until, on September 20, both were overtaken by [[Jason Day (golfer)|Jason Day]], the [[2015 PGA Championship]] winner, who became the 19th world No. 1 with victory in the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]], his fifth of the season. A week later, Spieth regained the No. 1 spot from Day after winning the Tour Championship (and with it, the FedEx Cup), and concluded 2015 as world No. 1, but Day's continued good form took him back to number one after winning the WGC Matchplay in March 2016. 

On February 19, 2017, [[Dustin Johnson]] became the 20th player to reach number one in the rankings following his victory at the [[Genesis Open]]. He would remain number one for over a year before being overtaken in May 2018 by [[Justin Thomas (golfer)|Justin Thomas]], who had won the PGA championship and four other events in 2017. Johnson regained top spot but was overtaken again in September 2018 by [[Justin Rose]], who had finished second at the Open and again in two FedEx Cup playoff events. Rose became the 22nd player to reach number one, and the fourth Englishman. Johnson regained the number one position from Rose but was replaced by a new number one for a third time in 2018 on October 21, when [[Brooks Koepka]] added victory in the [[CJ Cup]] to his two 2018 major titles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1458">The '''Program of the CPSU''' was the main document of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] which put forth  the strategic plans for internal and external politics of the Party and the [[Soviet Union]] as a whole. When the party was known under other names, the program was referred to accordingly, e.g., the '''Program of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)''', etc.

The first Program was adopted in 1903, with the main goals set were to abolish [[tsarism]] and transfer the  power to [[working class]].&lt;ref name=C27/&gt;

The second Program was adopted in 1917 after the [[October Revolution]] with the main goal to build the [[socialism|socialist society]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=C27/&gt;

The third Program was adopted in 1961 at the [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] with the ambitious goal to build [[communism in 20 years]]. 

The last version of the Program was adopted in 1986 at the [[27th Congress of the CPSU]]. Unlike previous Programs, the 1986 version was the amended 1961 version.&lt;ref name=C27&gt;[http://www.xs4all.nl/~eurodos/docu/cpsu-texts/cpsu86-0.htm Program of the CPSU, 27th Party Congress (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56340">This list of books published by [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] comprises titles reviewed in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' (1947 to 1974), plus reprints in the ''Mariners Library'' and ''Reynard Library'' series.

After serving in the [[World War II|Second World War]], Hart-Davis returned to his pre-war occupation as a publisher. In 1946 he founded Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd, in partnership with [[David Garnett]] and [[Edward Preston Young|Edward Young]] and with financial backing from [[Eric Linklater]], [[Arthur Ransome]], [[H. E. Bates]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], and [[Celia Johnson|Celia]] and [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]]. His own literary tastes dictated which books were accepted and which rejected. Frequently he turned down commercial successes because he thought little of the works' literary merit. He later said, "I usually found that the sales of the books I published were in inverse ratio to my opinion of them.  That's why I established some sort of reputation without making any money."&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

When the firm started, paper was rationed; they used Garnett's ex-serviceman's ration, but only one such ration per firm could be used so they could not use that of Hart-Davis. They were given the allocation at cost of a Glasgow bookseller and occasional prewar publisher, Alan Jackson. They decided to start initially with reprints of dead authors, as if a new book became a best-seller they would not have paper for a reprint and the author would leave the firm. They made an exception for Stephen Potter's ''Gamesmanship'' which was a short book; they collected every ream of paper they could buy, and printed 25,000 copies. Likewise 25,000 copies of Eric Linklater's ''Sealskin Trousers'' (five short stories) were printed.&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davis, p. 6f&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm had best-sellers such as [[Stephen Potter]]'s ''[[Gamesmanship]]'' and [[Heinrich Harrer]]'s ''[[Seven Years in Tibet]]'', which sold more than 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name=times79&gt;''The Times'', 29 November 1979, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the early years Hart-Davis secured [[Ray Bradbury]] for his firm, recognising the quality of a science fiction author who also wrote poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Other good sellers were Peter Fleming, Eric Linklater and [[Gerald Durrell]]; but best-sellers were too few, and though the output of Rupert-Hart-Davis Ltd was regularly praised for the high quality of its printing and binding, that too was an expense that weighed the company down.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[G. M. Young]]'s life of [[Stanley Baldwin]] was published in 1952, both [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]] threatened to sue if certain passages were not removed or altered. With the help of the lawyer [[Arnold Goodman]] an agreement was reached to replace the offending sentences, but they had the "hideously expensive" job of removing and replacing seven leaves from 7,580 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Davis, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 1950s, Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd could no longer sustain an independent existence and in 1956 it was absorbed into the Heinemann group.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr Bernstein buys book firm" in ''The Times'', 11 September 1963, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Heinemann sold the imprint to the American firm [[Harcourt Brace]] in 1961, who sold it to the [[Granada plc|Granada Group]] in 1963, when Hart-Davis retired from publishing, though remaining as non-executive chairman until 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2014}} Publications by the firm after Hart-Davis's retirement are included in the list. Hart-Davis continued to contribute some books to the company's lists after he retired.

The Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd logo was a woodcut of a fox, with a background of oak leaves. The company was based at No. 36 [[Soho Square]], London W1 from 1950, when they moved from 53 Connaught Street. Initially they planned to publish eight books according to their first advertisement in ''The Bookseller'', including ''Fourteen Stories'' by [[Henry James]] which was dated 1946 but did not actually appear until 14 February 1947. The annual book output according to Hart-Davis was: 1948, 16; 1949, 21; 1950, 25; 1951, 40; 1952, 37; (1953 not given); 1954, 41; 1955, 46; 1956, 45; 1957, 55 then 1962, 60. 

Book series published over the years by Rupert Hart-Davis included the ''Reynard Library''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishinghistory.com/the-reynard-library-rupert-hart-davis.html The Reynard Library (Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd.) - Book Series List], publishinghistory.com.

'''''SGS (New Zealand) Ltd v Quirke Export Ltd''''' [1988] 1 NZLR 52 CA  is a leading case in [[New Zealand]] regarding [[Exclusion clause|limitation clauses]] contained in [[contract]]s.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Quirke Export exported 2 shipments of onions to [[Taiwan]]. The size of the onions were important, with the onions required to be of a minimum size of between 2.25 and 2.5 inches, in order to suit the processing equipment in [[fast food restaurant]]s.

In order that the onions exported were not smaller than this size, they hired SGS to certify the onions did not exceed the minimum allowable size.

SGS were employed on the basis that any liability for damages was limited to a maximum of 10 times the SGS inspection fee charged, with the clause stating "The company's responsibility under this certificate is limited to gross negligence proven by Principals and will in no case be more than 10 times fees or commissions".

In 1983 SGS issued inspection certificates for 2 shipments of onions, charging $125, where upon delivery in Taiwan, were discovered to be outside the size requirements allowed, with 26% of the first shipment being found undersized, and the 76% of the second shipment.

It was subsequently discovered that SGS had issued the inspection certificates without first inspecting the onions, which the court later held as gross negligence on SGS's part.

These undersized onions were subsequently sold at a loss, and Quirke sued SGS for damages, and the High Court awarded $35,000 in damages against SGS.

SGS appealed, claiming that in any case, their liability for damages was limited to $1,125.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the actual loss was not $35,007, but instead only $8,000. However, the court ruled that the limitation clause was valid, and reduced the damages award to $1,250.

'''Seglora''' is the most rural part of the [[Borås Municipality]].  It is bordering to [[Mark Municipality]] and [[Bollebygd Municipality]] in western Sweden.

Seglora as a locality is not very well known in Sweden, but most Swedes know of the Seglora Church that can be found at [[Skansen]].  The Church there was sold to Skansen in 1916, and in 1918 the church was reopened at its new locality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4086">A '''SAFE (simple agreement for future equity)''' is an agreement between an [[investor]] and a [[company]] that provides rights to the investor for future [[Equity (finance)|equity]] in the company similar to a [[Warrant (finance)|warrant]], except without determining a specific [[price]] per [[Share (finance)|share]] at the time of the initial investment.  The SAFE investor receives the futures shares when a priced round of [[investment]] or [[liquidation]] event occurs. SAFEs are intended to provide a simpler mechanism for [[startup company|startups]] to seek initial funding than [[Convertible bond|convertible notes]].

==Mechanics==

The precise conditions of a SAFE vary. However, the basic mechanics&lt;ref name="ycomb"&gt;{{cite web|title=SAFE financing documents|url=http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/|website=www.ycombinator.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are that the investor provides a certain amount of funding to the company at signing. In return, the investor receives stock in the company at a later date, in connection with specific, contractually-agreed on liquidity events. The primary trigger is generally the sale of preferred shares by the company, typically as part of a future priced fund-raising round. Unlike a straight purchase of equity, shares are not valued at the time the SAFE is signed. Instead, investors and the company negotiate the mechanism by which future shares will be issued, and defer actual valuation. These conditions generally involve a valuation cap for the company and/or a discount to the share valuation at the moment of the trigger event. In this way, the SAFE investor shares in the upside of the company between the time the SAFE is signed (and funding provided) and the trigger event.

Unlike a convertible note, a SAFE is not a loan; it is more like a warrant. In particular, there is no interest paid and no maturity date, and therefore SAFEs are not subject to the regulations that debt may be in many jurisdictions. This simplicity is the primary motivation of a SAFE. "Safes should work just like convertible notes, but with fewer complications", according to startup accelerator [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].

'''Stuckist demonstrations''' since 2000 have been a key part of the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] art group's activities and have succeeded in giving them a high-profile both in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and abroad. Their primary agenda is the promotion of [[painting]] and opposition to [[conceptual art]].

Their demonstrations are particularly associated with the [[Turner Prize]] at [[Tate Britain]] (sometimes dressed as clowns to mock the museum), but have also been carried out at other venues, including [[Trafalgar Square]] and the [[Saatchi Gallery]]. There have also been other protests in the [[United States]] by [[Stuckism in America|US Stuckists]], and there have been Stuckist events against the [[Iraq War]] in 2003.

They have received extensive media coverage for these events both in the UK and internationally, and become possible suspects for any London art protests, as in [[Matthew Collings]]' description of the opening of [[Tate Modern]] in 2000: "Guilt-free art lovers crossed picket lines put up by envious artist-outsiders. They didn't know who was protesting out there. Maybe it was the Stuckists."&lt;ref name=artcrazy&gt;Collings, Matthew (2001). ''Art Crazy Nation'', page 16, 21 Publishing Ltd. {{ISBN|1-901785-08-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, no mention of any such demonstration on the Stuckism website.&lt;ref name=stuckismsite&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com Stuckism International official site] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Nicholas Serota]], director of the Tate gallery, has recognised the demonstrations as a contribution to artistic debate,&lt;ref name=rejects&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1710820,00.html "Tate rejects £500,000 gift from 'unoriginal' Stuckists", The Times, July 28, 2005] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the Tate archive contains material from the demonstrations,&lt;ref name=nordland&gt;Nordland, Rod.

==The Stuckists==
{{main|Stuckism}}
The Stuckists were founded in 1999 by [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]  and [[Billy Childish]] to promote figurative painting and oppose conceptual art. Thomson derived the name of the group from an insult by [[Tracey Emin]] to her ex-boyfriend Childish that he was "stuck". The original group of 13 artists has now grown to an international movement of 183 groups in 44 countries, as of November 2008. (Childish left the group in 2001.)

==Clowns at the Tate==
The Stuckists have demonstrated annually at [[Tate Britain]] on the occasion of the [[Turner Prize]] since 2000, and have been featured extensively in the media for their appearances. The demonstrations  have adopted a variety of themes to make their point, which is simply that the prize is named after a famous painter, but painting is neglected by it in favour of other media. Their Turner Prize manifesto comments: "The only person who wouldn't be in danger of winning the Turner Prize is Turner."&lt;ref name=turnermanifesto&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/realturner.html Stuckists Turner Prize Manifesto] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This is a leaflet they have handed out to the public and prize ceremony guests. Although they have always been outside the building during the actual prize ceremony, they have, on two occasions, been mentioned by the guest of honour on live TV, just before the announcement of the winner—by Sir [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] in 2003 and by Culture Minister, [[David Lammy]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=clown2000&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/clown2000.html "Archive of demos" www.stuckism.com] Retrieved March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000===
[[Image:2000 Stuckist Turner demo (1).jpg|thumb|Stuckist artists dressed as clowns demonstrate against the Turner Prize, Tate Britain, in 2000]]
The first Stuckist demonstration took place outside Tate Britain on Turner Prize day, 28 November 2000. The group took care to work within the regulations in order to subvert them and ridicule the institution. They were dressed as clowns, and had obtained advance permission to enter the museum in this costume. They announced on their web site (and in the London [[Evening Standard]]):&lt;ref name=send&gt;"Send in the Clowns for Turner", ''Evening Standard'', October 16, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|quote=Please note this is not a demonstration in the normal meaning. This is simply the exercise of ones right to visit the gallery which one has paid for, in the attire of ones choice. We have a written statement from the Tate Gallery that the following is permissible dress for admission: suit and tie, trainers, jeans, T-shirt, sports clothing, barrister's wig and gown, Napoleonic military uniform, gorilla suit, clown costume. It should be noted that the following is NOT permissible wear: naked, swimming costume, underwear.&lt;ref name=real&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/rtparch.html "The Real Turner Prize 2000", stuckism.com] Retrieved March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Damien Hirst]]'s godmother, the late Margaret Walsh, announced the "Art Clown of the Year" for "outstanding idiocy in the visual arts" was [[Charles Saatchi]], the prize being a custard pie, which the winner was expected to purchase and administer on themselves.&lt;ref name=astuckist-clowns&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Walker/AStuckistOnStuckism.html#Clowns "Clowns at the Tate" in "A Stuckist on Stuckism", stuckism.com] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This award continued to be made in subsequent years.

They then paraded outside [[Tate Britain]] in clown costumes, walked into the museum and around the exhibition itself. To coincide with the Tate's show, they also staged their own concurrent show ''The Real Turner Prize Show'' with simultaneous shows of the same name in Germany and Australia. ''The Guardian'' announced the winner of the real Turner Prize with the headline "Turner Winner Riles the Stuckists".&lt;ref name=riles&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/turnerpeoplespoll/story/0,,1067793,00.html "Turner Winner Riles the Stuckists", The Guardian, November 29, 2000] Retrieved March 26, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001===
[[Image:2001 Stuckist Turner demo 2 (1).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Charles Thomson at the 2001 demonstration with a cut-out of [[Tracey Emin]]]]
There was a demonstration in ordinary clothes at the Prize press launch on 6 November. ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' said, "In certain respects the Turner Prize never changes: art fleetingly makes the front pages; the dreary Stuckists protest outside the Tate and the winner gets a cheque for 20 grand."&lt;ref name=thrills&gt;"The critics: Visual art - Big thrills in the broom cupboard", ''[[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]]'', 11 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another demonstration took place on the Prize ceremony day, 9 December: this reached a worldwide TV audience, when it was syndicated by [[Reuters]].&lt;ref name=tate01&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/Tate01.html "Turner Prize demo 2001"], stuckism.com.

Retrieved 3 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ekow Eshun]] wrote, "if scandal equated directly to success then this year's winners should probably be the Stuckists, the ragged band of artist malcontents who've turned their annual placard-waving anti-Turner protest outside the Tate into a kind of art event of their own that now generates press attention from around the world."&lt;ref&gt;Ekow Eshun [https://web.archive.org/web/20011224054437/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/news_comment/weekinfocus/turner.shtml BBC site], 24 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stuckists gave their "Art Clown of the Year Award" to Sir Nicholas Serota. Other nominees were [[Charles Saatchi]] (the winner in 2000), [[Norman Rosenthal]] and [[Sarah Kent]].&lt;ref name=tate01/&gt;

===2002===
There was a demonstration at the Turner Prize press launch on 29 October, and one in clown costume on the prize day, 8 December. The "Art Clown of the Year Award" was given to Serota again, with the commendation, "The judges were extremely impressed by Sir Nicholas's ability to create a Turner Prize show which was even worse than last year's",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/RTPS2002/index.html "The Real Turner Prize 2002"], stuckism.com.

===2003===
In 2003, the Stuckists displayed two blow-up sex dolls to parody [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]]'s bronze (painted) sculpture modelled on one.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/turnerprize2003/story/0,,1102084,00.html "Turner Prize Goes to Perry – and Claire", The Guardian, December 8, 2003] Retrieved March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As guests, including [[Jay Jopling]], [[Tracey Emin]], [[Victoria Miro Gallery|Victoria Miro]] and Jake Chapman, arrived, they were greeted with the announcement, "Turner Prize preview—see the original here and the copy inside."  [[Sarah Kent]], art editor of [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]], commented, "Fucking Stuckists... yes, you can quote me."&lt;ref name=clown2000/&gt; Inside Tate Britain, on live television, Serota introduced Sir Peter Blake, who before he announced the winner, started his speech: "Thank you very much Nick. I'm quite surprised to be here tonight, because two days ago I had a phone call asking if I would be a judge for the [[Not the Turner Prize]]. And two years ago I was asked by the Stuckists to dress as a clown and come and be on the steps outside, so I am thrilled and slightly surprised to be here."&lt;ref name=clown2000/&gt; There were cheers from the guests.&lt;ref name=astuckist-clowns/&gt;

===2004===
[[Image:2004 Stuckist Turner demo 1 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Stuckist protest against the Turner Prize, 19 October 2004, enlisting Charles Saatchi's name]]
There were two Stuckist demonstrations, one at the press launch on 19 October and one at the prize-giving day on 6 December. On 10 October, [[Charles Saatchi]] had been quoted in the press as saying there were not enough painters in the Prize—"For the last 10 years, only five of the 40 Turner Prize artists have been pure painters."
&lt;ref name=latestshock&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/02/nsaat02.xml "Saatchi's Latest Shock for the Art World Is – Painting", The Daily Telegraph, October 10, 2004] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Stuckists turned this to their advantage with placards such as: "Charles Saatchi &amp; Stuckists v the Tate" and "No painters in the Turner Prize for the last 4 years!".

The Turner show itself was characterised by video and computer imagery, including a virtual tour of one of [[Osama bin Laden]]'s former residences. Thomson was quoted by the BBC website: "A lot of the stuff this year would be suitable for a Channel 4 documentary. There is no need for this to be in the Tate gallery when television does exactly the same thing."&lt;ref name=light&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3756514.stm "Light at the end of the Turner Show", BBC News Online, October 19, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

To bring their point home, the Stuckists handed out a leaflet which read, with the mock tone of officialdom: "We apologise for the lack of art in this year's Turner Prize. As an alternative, you will find a display of enthusiasts' television programmes and computer games."&lt;ref name=stuckisttate04&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/Tate04.html Tate 2004 demonstration on stuckism.com] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

They also announced:
{{bq|quote=Charles Saatchi is winner of the Art Clown of the Year Award 2004 for posing as a leader in the arts and merely parroting ideas promoted by the Stuckists for the last five years.

The nominees for 2004 were:&lt;br /&gt;
Momart (for not having the Shark and the Bed in their warehouse)&lt;br /&gt;
Damien Hirst (for wasting his money buying work by Damien Hirst),&lt;br /&gt;
Charles Saatchi (for copying the Stuckists' ideas five years afterwards)&lt;br /&gt;
[[Stella Vine]] (for numerous reasons)&lt;br /&gt;
The Prize is a custard pie which the winner is entitled to purchase and push into their own face.&lt;ref name=stuckisttate04/&gt;}}

===2005===
[[Image:2005 Stuckist Turner demo (2).jpg|thumb|left|Stuckists outside the [[Turner Prize]], [[Tate Britain]], December 2005, demonstrate against the purchase of [[Chris Ofili]]'s ''[[The Upper Room (paintings)|The Upper Room]]''. The cutout is Tate Chairman [[Paul Myners]].]]
The Stuckists demonstrated outside the [[Turner Prize]] on 6 December 2005 against the Tate's purchase of its trustee, [[Chris Ofili]]'s work, ''The Upper Room''. They displayed placards with slogans such as "£25,000 Turner Prize, £705,000 Trustee Prize", and wore monkey and elephant masks, referring to the monkeys Ofili had painted in his work, as well as the trademark balls of elephant dung it was propped on.&lt;ref name=shed&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/shed-wins-58000-art-prize/2005/12/06/1133631231483.html "Shed Wins $58,000 Art Prize", Sydney Morning Herald December 6, 2005 (a Reuters syndicated report)] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstrators were approached by Sir [[Nicholas Serota]], and the atmosphere was tense, according to Thomson: "I thought he was going to explode ... I looked at his face and I thought, this guy's going to lose it and hit me, or he's going to burst into tears."&lt;ref name=punks&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1664698,00.html "How Ageing Art Punks Got Stuck into Tate's Serota", The Observer, December 11, 2005] Retrieved March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Marr]], a guest at the evening Prize reception, commented, "When they picketed us, the Stuckists seemed to me affable and intelligent people", although he strongly disagreed with them over Ofili's work.&lt;ref name=marr&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/12/07/do0705.xml Notebook by Andrew Marr (2nd item), The Daily Telegraph, December 7, 2005] Retrieved March 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

That evening in front of guests at the award ceremony in what Marr described as a "moment of rare passion" and an "unusual, possibly unprecedented" move, Serota spoke out with "an angry defence" of the purchase,&lt;ref name=marr/&gt; saying, "I defy anybody who has actually taken the time and trouble to see the work not to agree with the trustees' decision to acquire this most extraordinary and important piece of work."&lt;ref name="shed guardian"&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/turnerprize2005/story/0,16063,1659056,00.html?gusrc=rss "It's a shed, it's collapsible, it floats and (with help from a bike) it's the winner", The Guardian, December 6, 2005] Retrieved March 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, David Lammy, the Culture Minister, made a brief speech before presenting the award, commenting, "Every year, the Turner Prize makes contemporary art the talk of the airwaves ... Stuckists threaten never to paint again",&lt;ref name=demo2005&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/Tate05.html "Turner Prize Demo 5 December 2005" on stuckism.com] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (although there is no evidence they had ever made such a statement).

The Stuckists were included in reports on the Prize by the four UK broadsheets and in a Reuters syndication internationally, where Thomson commented, "The Tate is run by a self-serving clique who hide behind secretiveness" and "The real prize at the Tate is becoming a trustee. It's worth far more money." The winner, [[Simon Starling]] had converted a shed into a boat and back again; ''The Times'' quoted Thomson that "The Turner should be renamed the B&amp;Q diy prize."&lt;ref name=oneman&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html "One Man and His Boat Sail into a Storm over the Turner", The Times, December 6, 2006] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006===
[[Image:2006, Stuckist Turner Prize demo 2006 (1).jpg|thumb|Sir Nicholas Serota holding a protest leaflet showing his portrait]]
The Stuckists handed Sir Nicholas Serota a demonstration leaflet with a Turner Prize "health warning" on one side (claiming that "the exhibits may cause drowsiness or headaches") and Thomson's painting of him on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/early-delivery-no-surprise-from-australian-spinner-427146.html 'Serota told to stick his prize',] ''The Independent'' 2006-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; He held it up and said, "Can't you make another image?"&lt;ref name="stuck 2006"&gt;[http://stuckism.com/Tate/Tate06.html Stuckist Turner demo on stuckism web site], Retrieved 2008-04-05&lt;/ref&gt; Tate chairman [[Paul Myners]] informed demonstrating artist, [[John Bourne (artist)|John Bourne]], "We are grateful for the extra publicity the Stuckists have given the Tate".&lt;ref name="stuck 2006"/&gt;

The Stuckists picketed the 2006 ceremony with placards bearing the slogan 'Is It All A Fix?', a quote from Turner judge [[Lynn Barber]], who had broken with convention by writing about the judging process in ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref name="Barber"&gt;Barber, Lynn (2006)[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1968403,00.html "My Turner's over. Phew!] ''The Observer, 10 December 2006. Accessed 16 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; She encountered the demonstrators, whilst going outside from the judging to have a cigarette, afterwards saying she was horrified to see her words displayed: "The words were taken completely out of context (I dread to think how often celebs have said that to me in interviews, and how often I have disbelieved them) but now I am stuck with being a hero of the Stuckist tendency. I scuttled back into the Tate and survived three hours without nicotine rather than risk encountering them again.&lt;ref name="Barber"/&gt; Thomson's quote that winner [[Tomma Abts]]' work resembled "doodles done by a lobotomised computer" appeared in ''[[The Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya.

===2007===
The Stuckists announced that they were not demonstrating for the first time since 2000, because of "the lameness of this year’s show, which does not merit the accolade of the traditional demo".  They criticised the "recycling" of nominees as being laziness by the jury (two of the four had been nominated in previous years) and stated that Tate Chairman, [[Paul Myners]] had previously thanked them for giving the Tate extra publicity. They also claimed that [[Mark Wallinger]] had copied their idea of walking round a museum dressed in a costume, that he was indistinguishable from a Stuckist demonstrator,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/stuckists-turner-prize-protest-apology-2/ "Stuckists’ Turner Prize Protest Apology" on 3ammagazine.com] Retrieved December 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and that his work was "utter bilge", which had "all the excitement of watching a pensioner do the shopping at Asda".&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel.

{{quotation|
# Everyone talks about The Turner Prize but very few people believe in its worth. It has become an ongoing national joke, because of its pathetic and pretentious exhibits.
# The Turner Prize is not, despite what Sir Nicholas Serota believes, the popularising of art but its [[dumbing down]] into a circus of curiosities.
# The Turner Prize effectively turns The Tate Gallery into a state-funded advertising agency for Charles Saatchi, the Lisson Gallery and the White Cube Gallery.
# Turner did not rebuild launderettes. He did not take photographs. He did not make videos, nor, to our knowledge, did he pickle sheep or construct concrete casts of negative space.
# It should be pointed out that what Turner actually did was to paint pictures.
# To call The Turner Prize The Turner Prize is like calling bubble-gum caviar.
# The only artist who wouldn't be in danger of winning The Turner Prize is Turner.
# To award The Turner Prize to an inferior re-hash of a Buster Keaton film is like awarding an Oscar to the workman who paint the Forth Bridge.
# If the Trustees of The Tate Gallery have any respect for the values to which Turner devoted his life, The Turner Prize must be awarded to an artist who continues the tradition of communicating the power of life through painting.
# Alternatively, we propose that The Turner Prize should be renamed The Duchamp Award for the destruction of artistic integrity.}}

===Tate response===

Sir [[Nicholas Serota]] wrote to the Stuckists in 2005, rejecting a donation of Stuckist paintings, but saying he wanted to ensure "the Tate archive, as the national record of art in Britain, properly represents the contribution of the Stuckist movement to debates about contemporary art in recent years."&lt;ref name=rejects/&gt; In 2006, Tate chairman, [[Paul Myners]], thanked the Stuckists for providing the Tate with extra publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Charles.

Retrieved 3 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Blood feud with Saatchi==
The Stuckists had declared their opposition to [[Charles Saatchi]] from the outset, criticising what they saw as the vacuity of [[Young British Artists|Britart]]: "You can't help feeling that Saatchi's insipid sensationalism would make Duchamp wish that he'd never ever exhibited his piss-pot in the first place and had become a water-colourist instead."&lt;ref name=openletter&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/serotaletter.html "An Open Letter to Sir Nicholas Serota" by the Stuckists] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===A dead shark isn't art 2003===
[[Image:Stuckism International Gallery 2003 (shark 2).jpg|thumb|''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', [[Stuckism International Gallery]], 2003]]
In 2003, the [[Saatchi Gallery]] re-opened at [[County Hall]] with a [[Damien Hirst]] retrospective, which included the exhibition of his refurbished piece, ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'', a shark in a tank of formaldehyde. On the same day as the Saatchi opening, the [[Stuckism International Gallery]] in [[Shoreditch]]—under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art''— exhibited another dead shark, which had first been put on public display in 1989 (two years before Hirst's was first shown) by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. The Stuckists suggested Hirst may have seen this at the time and copied it, and pointed out that whether Hirst plagiarised Saunders work or not, Saunders was the real pioneering artist.&lt;ref name=deadshark&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/SharkSpot.html "A Dead Shark Isn't Art" on the Stuckism International web site] Retrieved March 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stella Vine and OFT 2004===
In February 2004, Saatchi bought ''Hi Paul Can You Come Over'', a painting by ex-stripper [[Stella Vine]] of [[Princess Diana]] with blood coming from the mouth (it was then exhibited in his next show, ''New Blood''). There was international media reporting of this. Vine was talked of as "the new star of the Brit art scene", commenting, "I didn't think anyone really liked what I was doing", and that she had only been painting for four years "after accompanying her son Jamie, 18, to Hampstead School of Art" (a private college).&lt;ref name=firstblood&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/02/24/nsaat24.xml "First Blood to Saatchi as a Star Is Born", The Daily Telegraph, February 24, 2006] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

This caused a strong reaction from the Stuckists. Vine had for a short time been a member of their group, and they had first exhibited her in 2001, when she was also (briefly) married to Charles Thomson. She had even been a nominee for their ''Real Turner Prize Show''. ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper validated these claims and reported Thomson's complaint that Saatchi had been "stealing their identity as he tires of the Britart scene".&lt;ref name=war&gt;"Saatchi and Stuckists Brush in War of the Art Worlds", The Independent, March 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson and eleven other people (including non-Stuckists, such as [[David Lee (art critic)|David Lee]] and Christopher Fiddes of the Movement for Classical Renewal) then reported Saatchi to the [[Office of Fair Trading]].&lt;ref name=abuses&gt;"Charles Saatchi 'Abuses His Hold on British Art Market'", ''The Independent on Sunday'', March 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The grievance was:
{{bq|quote=Mr Saatchi's dominant market and PR position allowed him to achieve blanket coverage for a version of events which completely ignored her &lt;nowiki&gt;[Vine's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; background with the Stuckists. Had this been known, it would have led to increased interest in the Stuckists as a group where new talent was fostered, and the likelihood of increased sales as collectors hoped to find another future star.&lt;ref name=oft&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Saatchi/SaatchiOFT.html "Charles Saatchi Reported to OFT", stuckism.com] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the complaint was not upheld and the OFT pronounced, "We do not have reasonable grounds to suspect that Charles Saatchi is in a dominant position in any relevant market", which Thomson turned to advantage by spotting the unintended slight and remarking that it was "just another cruel smack in the face" for Saatchi.&lt;ref name=oftattack&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Walker/AStuckistOnStuckism.html#OFT "Charles Saatchi and the OFT Attack", A Stuckist on Stuckism, stuckism.com] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Triumph of Painting 2005===
[[Image:2005 Saatchi Gallery demo.jpg|thumb|Stuckist demonstration at the [[Saatchi Gallery]].]]
The Stuckists' concerns were not alleviated, when, at the end of 2004, Saatchi announced that he was putting his Britart holding into storage and devoting the next year to exhibitions featuring only painting. A few months prior to this announcement, Saatchi had stood outside the Stuckism International gallery,&lt;ref name=street&gt;"Saatchi Stuck in Street", ''The Independent'', May 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; reading not only a placard that declared "STUCKIST ART IN 2001 IS SAATCHI ART IN 2004" (referring to Stella Vine), but also the anti-conceptual art, pro-painting Stuckist manifesto, which was on display.&lt;ref name=saatchivisits&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/gossip.html#SaatchiVisits "Charles Saatchi Visits Stuckism International", on stuckism.com] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson responded immediately in the press to the announcement of Saatchi's change of direction, with the accusation: "almost verbatim, he's stolen the introduction to our manifesto."&lt;ref name=latestshock/&gt;

When the show, ''The Triumph of Painting'', opened at the Saatchi Gallery on 25 October 2005, the Stuckists mounted a picket outside, handing leaflets to the incoming guests (who included Saatchi's wife [[Nigella Lawson]]), and displaying placards stating, "Stuckism leads, Saatchi follows" and "Stuckism in 1999 is Saatchi in 2005".
They also wore tall hats with Saatchi's face on,&lt;ref name=saatchidemo05&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/SaatchiDemo05/Index.html Stuckists demo at the Saatchi Gallery on stuckism.com] Retrieved March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomson was photographed inside the gallery opening, wearing a T-shirt with the words "Saatchi the Stuckist".&lt;ref name=toast&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/magazine/people/val/val2-8-05.asp "Toast of the Town, Photos by Thierry Bal on artnet.com] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other UK demonstrations==

===Trafalgar Square===

The Stuckists demonstrated in 2001 in Trafalgar Square, when [[Rachel Whiteread]]'s statue, ''Monument'', was unveiled. This was a resin cast of the fourth (vacant) plinth in the square, and was inverted on the existing plinth. It represents the type of [[conceptual art]] that the Stuckists strongly oppose. The statue was unveiled by the then-[[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]], [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], against whom Thomson was standing in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]] as a Stuckist candidate. At this point Stuckist protesters (one of whom was [[Stella Vine]]) in the watching crowd held up protest placards. Thomson jumped over the metal crowd barrier onto the now-vacant podium and used the PA system to make an address about the complete absence of paintings in that year's Turner Prize (referring to a comment by Smith the previous year that there should be more paintings in the Prize). At the same time he held up a placard, which read, "Mr Smith, do you really think this stupid plinth is a work of art?"&lt;ref name=trafalgar&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Walker/AStuckistOnStuckism.html#Battle "The Battle of Trafalgar", A Stuckist on Stuckism, stuckism.com] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When the PA system was switched off by an official, Thomson made his way back through the crowd and was surprised to find that an angry Serota had followed him.

:Serota: "That was a cheap shot, using another artist's work to promote your ideas."
:Thomson: "It's Dada."
:Serota: "So that gives you the right to do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it?"
:Thomson: "You and a few people like you control the art world and what goes on in it, and as artists this is the only way we can put our point of view across."
: (At this point Serota walked off.)
:Thomson: "That was Sir Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate Gallery. Three cheers for Sir Nicholas."&lt;ref name=trafalgar/&gt;

The Stuckism website headed its report on the incident with a quote from Serota's book ''Experience or Interpretation'': "a willingness ... to risk offence by unexpected confrontation can yield rewards"&lt;ref name=sir&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/news.html#sir "Serota Tells off the Stuckists", stuckism.com] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Death of Conceptual Art===
[[Image:Stuckists Death of Conceptual Art demo.jpg|thumb|Stuckist artists leave a coffin, marked "The death of conceptual art", outside the [[White Cube]] gallery in [[Shoreditch]], 25 July 2002.]]
In 1999, the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] art group had declared themselves "opposed to the sterility of the white wall gallery system", and, three years later, they opened their own Stuckism International  gallery (with coloured walls) in [[Shoreditch]] in  an adjoining street to the [[White Cube]] gallery, which represents [[Tracey Emin]] and [[Damien Hirst]]. To celebrate the opening on 25 July 2002, they dressed as clowns, processed the short distance from Charlotte Road over [[Old Street]] and deposited a coffin, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art", outside the White Cube's door&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas", ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  with the comment, "This is the official date for the demise of conceptual art."&lt;ref name=clown2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=death&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Walker/AStuckistOnStuckism.html#Death "The Death of Conceptual Art", A Stuckist on Stuckism, stuckism.com] Retrieved March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===General election===
In 2001, Stuckist Co-founder, [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] stood as a Stuckist candidate for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 British General Election]], on an anti-Britart ticket, in the constituency of [[Islington South and Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington South and Finsbury]], against [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]]. Thomson picked up 108 votes (0.4%).

===Cutting the string===
In spring 2003, artist [[Cornelia Parker]] was allowed by the authorities to wrap [[Auguste Rodin]]’s sculpture ''[[The Kiss (Rodin sculpture)|The Kiss]]'' (1886) in [[Tate Britain]] in a mile of string.&lt;ref name=strings&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,909667,00.html "No Strings Attached" The Guardian] Retrieved March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many people felt it offensive to the original artwork and an act of vandalism rather than art. As a reaction, Stuckist artist Piers Butler cut the string, while couples stood around engaging in live kissing. However, this was described as an individual action outside the main Stuckist group by Thomson, who nevertheless took the opportunity to remark: "I was puzzled that Parker had been allowed to do her string-wrapping—thereby using another artist's work to promote her ideas—as this was precisely the allegation that an enraged Serota had thrown at me in Trafalgar Square and dubbed a 'cheap shot'."&lt;ref name=piers&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Walker/AStuckistOnStuckism.html#String  "String up the Perpetrator" A Stuckist on Stuckism] Retrieved March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==US Stuckist demonstrations==

===Seattle Pigs on Parade===
In May 2001, the [[Seattle]] Stuckist group (J. Puma, Z.F. Lively, Amanda Perrin and Brett Hamil) protested with placards,  such as "Art-vertising is bad for the soul" and "Tacky and lame", against "Pigs on Parade", large fibreglass pigs which had been installed in the city and decorated by artists to make money for charity. Their objection was to commercial devaluation of art through "an insidious trend in corporate art-vertising. It appeals to the lowest public tastes by providing a kitschy, totally predigested and inoffensive McArt for the masses." (Social or ethical comment was banned from the designs.)  King 5 News mentioned the group (with a "glib chuckle"), but otherwise the event went unreported. There was a certain amount of public support, and Hamil concluded: "For some reason, Stuckists are saddled with the task of vocalizing what everyone already knows, and yet that doesn't make it any less valid. It just makes it that much more regrettable that no one's said it yet."&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/seattle/Seattle_Parade.htm Seattle Stuckists report on "Pigs on Parade"] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clown Trial of President Bush===
In order to "highlight the fact that the [[Iraq War]] does not have the support of the [[United Nations]], thus violating a binding contract with the UN", ''The Clown Trial of President Bush'' took place at 7 p.m. on March 21, 2003 on the steps of the [[New Haven]] Federal Courthouse, staged by local Stuckist artists dressed in clown costume, led by [[Jesse Richards]], [[Nicholas Watson]] and [[Tony Juliano]]. One of the participants was "a public defender for the state of CT. He thought it would be cool to dress up with us as clowns and do the thing. He ended up playing the clown judge. The courthouse that he works at is a block away from the federal courthouse where we did this."&lt;ref name=clownjudge&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/intnews.html#ClownTrial Clown Trial of President Bush on stuckism.com] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously the New Haven Stuckism International gallery run by them opened a ''War on Bush'' show, including work from Brazil, Germany and the UK, while the London Stuckism International Gallery  staged a "War on Blair" show.&lt;ref name=waronbush&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/WarOnArch.html ''War on Bush'' and ''War on Blair'' shows on stuckism.com with some paintings] Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Yale Herald'' reported with the headline, "Stuckists scoff at 'crap,' war". Richards took the opportunity to comment, "[[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] would go over to the [[Yale University Art Gallery]] and he would say, 'This is crap,' and he would go paint a picture." &lt;ref name=yaleherald&gt;[http://yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=1957 "Stuckists scoff at 'crap' war", The Yale Herald, March 28, 2003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921191936/http://yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=1957 |date=September 21, 2005}} Retrieved March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protest shows and art==
[[File:Charles Thomson. Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision.jpg|thumb|''[[Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision]]'', 2000, painting by Charles Thomson]]
The Stuckists have made use of their art shows in order also to promote a message. The name of the group itself is an ironic pre-emptive riposte to their anticipated enemies—as represented in the first instance by former colleague-turned-[[Young British Artists|YBA]], [[Tracey Emin]], who had called the group's co-founder, [[Billy Childish]], "stuck". The group's first show in 1999 was titled, ''Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!''. In 2000, they made an overt challenge with a show titled, ''The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota''. A painting in the show, ''[[Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision]]'' by Charles Thomson, has since been reproduced in the media many times and become an iconic image for the Stuckists.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Jane.

In 2005, another show was called: ''"Painting Is the Medium of Yesterday"—Paul Myners CBE, Chairman of Tate Gallery, Chairman of Marks and Spencer, Chairman of Aspen Insurance, Chairman of Guardian Media, Director of Bank of England, Director of Bank of New York. A Show of Paintings by the Stuckists, as Refused by the Tate Gallery. Guaranteed 100% Free of Elephant Dung.''

==Anti-Stuckist demonstration==
{{main|Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi}}
There has only been one known anti-Stuckist demonstration, which was in 1999, when two Chinese [[performance art]]ists jumped on [[Tracey Emin]]'s installation ''My Bed'', in the Turner Prize at [[Tate Britain]]. The pair had various words written on their bodies, including "Anti-Stuckism". Their explanation is that they were opposed to the Stuckists, who are anti-[[performance art]].&lt;ref name=jumping&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/gossip.html#11 "The Jumping Chinese Gentlemen at It again" Herr von Stuck's Hot Gossip Page] Retrieved March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fiachra Gibbons of ''The Guardian'', the event "will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement."

'''''Television New Zealand Ltd v Quinn''''' [1996] 3 NZLR 24 is a New Zealand [[defamation]] case.

==Background==
[[TVNZ]] current affairs show [[Holmes (TV series)|''Holmes'']], in 2 different episodes alleging that the president of the [[Auckland Trotting Club]], Mr Quinn was involved in illegal [[horse doping]] and financial misconduct involving the club.

Both allegations were later to be discovered to be untrue. It was also later held that the programs investigation at the time did not meet the expected journalist standards.

Quinn sued TVNZ for defamation for both matters, and was awarded $400,000 for the horse doping allegation, and $1.1 million for the financial misconduct allegation.

TVNZ appealed both awards.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that the award for the $400,000 while it was at the upper amount for defamation, it was not going to be reversed. However, with regards to the award for $1.1 million, the court found this to be excessive, and referred it back to the High Court, with the recommendation that any award over $500,000 might be found excessive.

Maxwell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebiblestory.com/tbs/author.php "The Man Behind the Most Famous Bible Stories" (''The Bible Story'')]&lt;/ref&gt; based on the [[King James Version|King James]] and [[Revised Standard Version|Revised Standard]] versions of the [[Christian Bible]].  The books, published from 1953–57, retell most of the narratives of the Bible in 411 stories. Compared to the source material, the stories are sanitized for young readers, and gloss over elements Maxwell apparently found inappropriate for a child audience (there is, for instance, no mention of [[circumcision]] despite the relative prominence of this rite in the Bible text).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/biblestorymoreth10maxw "The Bible Story" at ''Archive.org'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The books have been [[marketing|marketed]] in the [[United States]] for many years by placing the first volume, which covers the first part of the [[Book of Genesis]], in [[Physician|doctor]]'s offices with postage prepaid [[postcard]]s included for readers to order the set or ask for more information.  Originally written in [[English language|English]], the books have been [[translation|translated]] into [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (as ''Las Bellas Historias de la Biblia''), and a new revision has been made based on the [[New International Version]] (NIV) translation of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/396504.The_Bible_Story "The Bible Story (Ten Volume Set)" at ''Goodreads'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bible Story'' is jointly published by the [[Review and Herald Publishing Association]] and the [[Pacific Press Publishing Association]], both closely associated with the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Although Arthur Maxwell himself was a Seventh-day Adventist, ''The Bible Story'' has received numerous endorsements from both [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] clergy alike.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}. The Seventh-Day Adventist slant is discernable especially in passages that deal with the [[Sabbath]], which receives its own chapter ("A Day to Remember") in the first volume of the series. Here Maxwell elaborates on how God revealed the Sabbath to Adam and Eve:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He blessed the Sabbath so it would be a blessing to them.  He set it apart as a holy day not for Himself, but for them.  Even now six thousand years later, all who keep the seventh day holy, find a blessing in it that others never know!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As is evident from this quote, Maxwell also presupposes [[Young Earth Creationism]] with a literal six-day creation taking place six thousand years before the present, in accordance with [[Ussher chronology]]. The introductory chapter to the first volume encourages the reader to reflect on the origin of animals, humans and the earth itself, asking where everything came from. The reader is pointed to the Bible account as the only trustworthy source:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many great men have tried to explain these things [i.e., the origins of lifeforms and the planet itself]. They have come up with all sorts of strange ideas and suggestions, but most of them are far from the truth. In only one place - the Bible - will you find the true story. If you will open this wonderful Book, you will find that the very first part is called Genesis, meaning "the book of beginnings." Here you will find the answers to your questions about where everything came from.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of the chapter, Maxwell asserts that human lineages go back to God, thus explicitly dismissing the [[theory of evolution]] in favor of [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://truthorfables.com/Uncle_Arthur.htm Ammerall, Craig. "Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories Truth in Advertising?" (''Truth or Fables'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cinema Book''''' is a [[film studies]] textbook edited by [[Pam Cook]] and first published by the [[British Film Institute]] (BFI) in 1985 as a resource for teachers. The first edition was based on the BFI Education Department's collection of film clips for use as study guides. However, at the time there were few film textbooks, and ''The Cinema Book'' was an unexpected success. Over the next decade it was adopted by many film studies courses around the world and translated into several languages.

By the time of the second edition in 1999, co-edited with Mieke Bernink, the film clip collection was deemed redundant and the book was transformed into an in-depth guide to film history and updated to include recent theoretical developments. A third revised edition appeared in 2007.

''The Cinema Book'' was one of the last books to be published by BFI Publishing as an integral part of the British Film Institute. Amid some controversy,&lt;ref&gt;See Toby Miller (ed.), 'In Focus: The British Film Institute', ''Cinema Journal'' 47, no. 4, Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the institute entered into a partnership deal with global publishers [[Palgrave Macmillan]] and BFI Publishing staff were relocated to Macmillan's offices in London's King's Cross in January 2008.

'''''The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary: or, the Accomplish'd Housewives Companion''''' was a cookery book written by John Nott and first published in London in 1723.

==Context==

Nott had been the chief cook for a string of aristocrats, named on the title page of his book as the Dukes of Somerset, Ormond, and Bolton, and the Lords Lansdown and Ashburnham.

==Book==

===Contents===

The book describes how to make savoury dishes including "Bisks, Farces, forc'd Meats, Marinades, Olio's, Puptons, Ragoos, Sauces, Soops, Pottages". Pastries include biscuits, cakes, custards, puddings, pies and tarts. Confectionery includes candying and conserving flowers, fruits, and roots, as well as jellies, marmalades and decorative "sugar-works". Drinks include the making of beer, cider, mead, perry and English wines, as well as cordials. The book ends with a list of suggested bills of fare for every month of the year.&lt;ref name="Nott"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nott |first1=John |title=The cooks and confectioners dictionary; or, The accomplish'd housewifes companion|date=1723 |publisher=C. Rivington |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P38EAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is prefaced with a four-page Introduction "To All Good Housewives", beginning "Worthy Dames, Were it not for the sake of Custom, which has made it as unfashionable for a Book to come abroad without an Introduction, as for a Man to appear at Church without a Neckcloth, or a Lady without a Hoop-petticoat, I should not have troubled you with this."{{efn|This memorably humorous start was boldly plagiarised by [[Eliza Smith]] four years later in her ''[[The Compleat Housewife]]''.&lt;ref name=Yost&gt;{{cite journal| author=Yost, Genevieve |title=The Compleat Housewife or Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion. A Bibliographical Study |journal=William and Mary Quarterly |volume=18 | year=1938 |pages=419–435 |jstor=1922976 |doi=10.2307/1922976}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The introduction ends with "Your humble Servant, The Compiler". There follows "Some Divertisements in Cookery, us'd at Festival-Times, as Twelfth-Day, &amp;c."

The main text is laid out as a dictionary from [[Ale|Al]] to [[Zest (ingredient)|Zest]]. It included items now unfamiliar, such as [[battalia pie|Battalia Pye of Fish]], a "very large Pye, and cut with [[Battlements]] ... with as many Towers as will contain your several sorts of Fish", which included [[salmon]], [[cockle (bivalve)|cockles]], [[prawn]]s, [[oyster]]s, and [[Littorinidae|periwinkles]].&lt;ref name="Foodie"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clarkson |first1=Janet |title=Battalia Pie |url=http://www.theoldfoodie.com/2012/11/battalia-pie.html |website=The Old Foodie |accessdate=8 February 2016 |date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is followed by Bills of Fare, Terms of Art for Carving, Instructions for Carving, The Manner of Setting out a Desert of Fruits and Sweet-meats, and the Alphabetical Index.

[[File:To make an Amlet of Asparagus Nott 1723.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Recipe "To make an Amlet of Asparagus" in John Nott's ''The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary'', 1723]]

Since the main text is an alphabetical list, there are no sections, and the recipes stand alone without instructions on kitchen equipment or general comments on types of dish.

The entries are named, either like "Asparagus with Butter" as dishes, or like "To make an Amlet of Asparagus" as goals to be attained. The ingredients are not listed. Quantities, if mentioned at all, are simply included in the text, as "an Egg or two", relying on the cook's judgement as to the exact quantity needed. Cooking conditions are similarly mentioned only in passing, as "over a gentle Fire". For example:&lt;ref name=Omelette/&gt;

::'''To make an Amlet of Asparagus'''

:: Blanch your [[Asparagus]], cut them in short Pieces, fry them in fresh Butter, with a little Parsley and [[Chives|Chibols]] ; then pur in some Cream, season them well, and let them boil over a gentle Fire: In the mean time make an [[Omelette|Amlet]] with new laid Eggs, Cream, and Salt ; when it is enough, dress it on a Dish ; thicken the Asparagus with the Yolk of an Egg or two, turn the Asparagus on the Amlet, and serve it up hot.&lt;ref name=Omelette&gt;Nott, 1723, page 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Nott's recipe for hot chocolate is said to be delicious. The bibliographer [[William Carew Hazlitt]], in his 1902 ''Old Cookery Books'', considered Nott well-read and intelligent as he drew his recipes from many sources at home and abroad, including "to dress mutton the Turkish way".&lt;ref name="Jane"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary: An 18th Century Cookery Book|url=https://janeaustensworld.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/the-cooks-and-confectioners-dictionary-an-18th-century-cookery-book/|publisher=Jane Austen's World|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Cookbooks|url=http://www.djmcadam.com/old-cookery-books.html|accessdate=5 February 2016|date=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nott's "Queen's Pottage" is recreated at ''The Gilbert Scott'' restaurant, though ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' notes that the chef, [[Marcus Wareing]], omits the original [[Comb (anatomy)|cockscomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clay|first1=Xanthe|title=The Gilbert Scott, St Pancras Hotel, London, restaurant preview|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/restaurants/8495233/The-Gilbert-Scott-St-Pancras-Hotel-London-restaurant-preview.html|accessdate=5 February 2016|agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nott's [[Salmagundy]] is likewise reworked by [[Heston Blumenthal]] in his ''Dinner'' restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunt|first1=Tristram|title=Dinner by Heston Blumenthal: a taste of the past|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/03/dinner-heston-blumenthal-history-menu|accessdate=5 February 2016|agency=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets'' notes that the "ubiquitous" [[crème brûlée]] appeared in the ''Dictionary'', but that [[Elizabeth David]] had traced Nott's version to François Massialot's recipe in his 1691 ''Cuisinier royal et bourgeois'', rendered as "Burnt Cream" in the English translation of his book,  ''The Court and Country Cook'' of 1702.&lt;ref name="GoldsteinMintz2015"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldstein |first1=Darra |last2=Mintz |first2=Sidney |last3=Krondl |first3=Michael |title=The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbi6BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 |year=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-931339-6 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation comments that Nott seems to have plagiarized "heavily" from [[Robert May (chef)|Robert May]] as well as Massialot, without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History is Served 18th Century Cookbook Bibliography|url=http://recipes.history.org/bibliography/|publisher=The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Irk bitig 07.jpg|thumb|right|The 10th-century ''[[Irk Bitig]]'' or "Book of Divination" of [[Dunhuang]] is an important source for early Turkic mythology]]
{{Culture of Turkey}}
'''Turkic mythology''' embraces [[Tengrism|Tengri]]ist and [[Shamanism in Central Asia|Shamanist]] and as well as all cultural and social subjects being a nomad folk. Later, especially after [[Turkic migration]] some of the myths were decorated with Islamic symbols. It has numerous common points with Mongol mythology and both of them were probably originated in a proto syncretic Tibetan Buddhist and nationalist mythology. Turkic mythology was influenced by other local mythologies. For example, in [[Tatar]] mythology elements of Finnic and Indo-European myth co-exist. Subjects from Tatar mythology include [[Äbädä]], [[Alara (fairy)|Alara]]. [[Şüräle]], [[Şekä]], [[Pitsen]], [[Tulpar]], and [[Zilant]]. Turks appearently practised all major religions, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorianism|Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Manichaeism]] before, the majority of Turks confessed to islam. Turks often syncretised the other religion into their prevailing mythological understanding.&lt;ref&gt;JENS PETER LAUT ''Vielfalt türkischer Religionen'' p. 25 (German) &lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Irk Bitig]]'', a 10th-century manuscript found in [[Dunhuang]] is one of the most important sources for Turkic mythology and religion. This book is written in [[Old Turkic alphabet]] like the [[Orkhon inscriptions]].

==Gods in Turkic mythology==
{{Main|List of Turkic mythological figures}}

===Tengri===
[[Tengri|Kök Tengri]] is the first of primordial deities in the religion of the early Turkic people. He was known as yüce or yaratıcı tengri (Creator God) after the Turks started to migrate and leave middle Asia, and see monotheistic religions Tengrism was changed from its pagan/politheistic origins. The religion was more like zoroastrianism after its change, with only two of the original gods remaining, Tengri, representing the good god and [[Uçmag]] ( a place like heaven or vallhalla), while Erlik took the position of the bad god and hell. The words [[Tengri]] and [[Sky]] were synonyms. It is unknown how Tengri looks. He rules the fates of entire people and acts freely. But he is fair as he awards and punishes. The well-being of people depends on his will. Tengri worship is first attested in the [[Old Turkic]] [[Orkhon inscriptions]] of the early 8th century.

===Other gods===
[[Umay]] (The Turkic root umāy originally meant 'placenta, afterbirth') is the goddess of fertility and virginity. [[Umay]] resembles earth-mother goddesses found in various other world religions and is the daughter of Tengri.

[[Öd Tengri]] Is the god of time being not well-known, as it states in the orhun stones, "Öd tengri is the ruler of time" and son of Kök Tengri.

[[Boz Tengri]] Like Öd Tengri, he is not known much. He is seen as the god of the grounds and steppes and is a son of Kök Tengri.

[[Kayra]] is the Spirit of God. Primordial god of highest sky, upper air, space, atmosphere, light, life and son of Kök Tengri.

[[Ülgen]] is the son of Kayra and Umay is the god of goodness. The Aruğ (Arı) denotes to "good spirits" in [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Altaic]] mythology. They are under the order of [[Ülgen]] and doing good things on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Türk Söylence Sözlüğü (Turkish Mythology Dictionary), Deniz Karakurt, [[:tr:Türk Söylence Sözlüğü|(OTRS: CC BY-SA 3.0)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erlik]] is the god of death and the underworld.

[[Ay Dede]] is the [[moon god]].

[[Gun Ana|Gün Ana]] is the [[sun goddess]].

==Symbols==

As a result of the nomad culture, the [[horse]] is also one of the main figures of Turkic mythology; Turks considered the horse an extension of the individual -though generally dedicated to the male- and see that one is complete with it. This might have led to or sourced from the term "at-[[bey]]i" (horse-lord).

The [[dragon]] (Evren, also Ebren), also expressed as a [[snake]] or [[lizard]], is the symbol of might and power.  It is believed, especially in mountainous [[Central Asia]], that dragons still live in the mountains of [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan/Tengri Tagh]] and [[Altay Mountains|Altay]]. Dragons also symbolize the god [[Tengri]] (Tanrı) in ancient Turkic tradition, although dragons themselves are not worshiped as gods.

The World Tree or [[Tree of Life]] is a central symbol in Turkic mythology. According to the Altai Turks, human beings are descended from trees. According to the [[Yakuts]], White Mother sits at the base of the Tree of Life, whose branches reach to the heavens where it is occupied by various creatures that have come to life there. The blue sky around the tree reflects the peaceful nature of the country and the red ring that surrounds all of the elements symbolizes the ancient faith of rebirth, growth and development of the Turkic peoples.

==Legends==

===Grey Wolf legend===
The [[Gray wolf|wolf]] symbolizes honor and is also considered the mother of most [[Turkic peoples]]. [[Asena]] is the name of one of the ten sons who were given birth by a mythical wolf in Turkic mythology.&lt;ref&gt;''[[:tr:s:Bozkurt Destanı (Türkiye)|Bozkurt Legend]]'' &lt;!--Ondan sonra Türk on kadınla evlendi, bir çok çocukları oldu. içlerinden Asena adını taşıyan biri hakanlık tahtına geçince boyun adı da Aşine oldu., Oğlanlar orada büyüdüler, orada evlendiler.

The legend tells of a young boy who survived a raid on his village. A she-wolf finds the injured child and nurses him back to health. He subsequently impregnates the wolf which then gives birth to ten half-wolf, half-human boys. One of these, Ashina, becomes their leader and establishes the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina clan]] which ruled the [[Göktürks]] and other [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[nomadic empire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Findley, Carter Vaughin.

Royal Academy of Arts, London, 2005. Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The wolf, pregnant with the boy's offspring, escaped her enemies by crossing the Western Sea to a cave near to the Qocho mountains, one of the cities of the [[Tocharians]]. The first Turks subsequently migrated to the Altai regions, where they are known as expert in [[iron]]workers, as the [[Scythians]] are also known to have been.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher I. Beckwith, Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present, Princeton University Press, 2011, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ergenekon legend===
The [[Ergenekon]] legend tells about a great crisis of the ancient Turks. Following a military defeat, the Turks took refuge in the legendary Ergenekon valley where they were trapped for four centuries. They were finally released when a blacksmith created a passage by melting rock, allowing the gray wolf [[Asena]] to lead them out.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental Institute of Cultural and Social Research, Vol. 1-2, 2001, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murat Ocak, The Turks: Early ages, 2002, pp.76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dursun Yıldırım, "Ergenekon Destanı", Türkler, Vol. 3, Yeni Türkiye, Ankara, 2002, {{ISBN|975-6782-36-6}}, pp. 527–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;İbrahim Aksu: The story of Turkish surnames: an onomastic study of Turkish family names, their origins, and related matters, Volume 1, 2006 , p.87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.

=== Oghuz legends ===
The legend of [[Oghuz Khagan]] is a central political mythology for Turkic peoples of Central Asia and eventually the [[Oghuz Turks]] who ruled in Anatolia and Iran.  Versions of this narrative have been found in the histories of Rashid ad-Din Tabib, in an anonymous 14th-century Uyghur vertical script manuscript now in Paris, and in Abu'l Ghazi's Shajara at-Turk and have been translated into Russian and German.

=== Korkut Ata stories ===

[[Book of Dede Korkut]] from the 11th century covers twelve legendary stories of the [[Oghuz Turks]], one of the major branches of the Turkish Peoples. It originates from the pre-Islamic period of the Turks, in which [[Tengriist]] elements in the Turkic culture were still predominate. It consists of a prologue and twelve different stories. The legendary story which begins in [[Central Asia]] is narrated by a dramatis personae, in most cases by [[Korkut Ata]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miyasoğlu|first=Mustafa|title=Dede Korkut Kitabı|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;Korkut Ata heritage (stories, tales, music related to Korkut Ata) presented by [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkey]] was included in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] of [[UNESCO]] in November 2018 as an example of multi-ethnic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/intangible-heritage-nine-elements-inscribed-representative-list|title=Intangible Heritage: Nine elements inscribed on Representative List|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|language=en|archive-url=https://en.unesco.org/news/intangible-heritage-nine-elements-inscribed-representative-list|archive-date=2018-11-29|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/heritage-of-dede-qorqud-korkyt-ata-dede-korkut-epic-culture-folk-tales-and-music-01399|title=Heritage of Dede Qorqud/Korkyt Ata/Dede Korkut, epic culture, folk tales and music|last=|first=|date=|website=ich.unesco.org|archive-url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/heritage-of-dede-qorqud-korkyt-ata-dede-korkut-epic-culture-folk-tales-and-music-01399|archive-date=2018-11-29|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legend of Timur===
The legend of [[Timur]] (Temir) is the most ancient and well-known. Timur found a strange stone that fell from the sky (an iron ore meteorite), making the first iron sword from it. Today, the word "demir" means "iron".

===Other legends===
* [[Epic of Köroğlu]]
* [[Epic of Manas]]

==Modern interpretations==

===Decorative arts===
[[File:5kr obverse.png|thumb|[[Turkish lira#Coins|5-''kuruş''-coin]] features the tree of life.]]
* A motif of the tree of life is featured on Turkish 5 Kuruş coins, circulated since early 2009.
* The flag of the [[Chuvash Republic]], a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]], is [[charge (heraldry)|charged]] with a stylized [[tree of life]], a symbol of rebirth, with the three suns, a traditional emblem popular in Chuvash art. Deep red stands for the land, the golden yellow—for prosperity.

'''''Yachting Pages''''' is a [[superyacht]] business with a range of products aimed at [[Captain (nautical)|captains]] and [[crew]], [[shipyards]], refit yards and all within the superyacht industry. ''Yachting Pages'' is available either in its original printed form, or online. Since the first edition of ''Yachting Pages'' was released in 2004, the book has grown rapidly into an established superyacht [[Trade directory|directory]].

The annual print directory is available in three separate editions:

*''Mediterranean, Europe, Africa &amp; Middle East''
*''USA, the Americas &amp; Caribbean''
*''Australasia, Asia Pacific &amp; Far East''

The [[Port]] Maps section at the front of every edition totals over 350 detailed maps of the world's superyacht [[marinas]]. Copies of the printed directory are hand delivered free of charge directly to superyachts by uniformed crew, and also to superyacht marinas and land-based superyacht businesses in over 92 countries.&lt;ref&gt; Yachtingpages.com &lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Company'''

''Yachting Pages'' was founded in May 2003 from current CEO Steve Crowe's spare bedroom in [[Antibes]], [[France]], with only one other member of staff. The company is now based in [[Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]] with 34 staff members, many of whom are [[multi-lingual]]. 

The first copy of ''Yachting Pages'' was launched at the Genoa Charter Show, in May 2004. 

Since then, growth of the business has created more products: ''Yachtingpages.com, Yachting Pages Refit, Yachting Pages Delivers and Superyacht Owners' Guide (SYOG).''
