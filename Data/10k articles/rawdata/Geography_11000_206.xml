'''AM/FM/GIS''' stands for [[Automated Mapping]]/[[Facilities Management]] and is a subset of [[GIS]], which is associated with [[public utilities]] like gas, electric, water and telecommunications. The term AM/FM/GIS mostly refers to [[GIS]] software that allows utility users to digitize, manage and analyze their utility network data. This data is stored in an underlying GIS database which also maintains the associations between the graphical entities and the attributes.

== Components ==
There are mainly two major components of any AM/FM/GIS system, the ''graphical component'' and the ''database component''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | contribution = An ESRI White paper
  | year = 2003
  | chapter-format = PDF
  | contribution-url = http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/utility-gis.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
.

=== Graphical component ===
The ''graphical component'', as the term suggests, deals with graphical data which can consist of different types of real world entities or objects represented graphically by shapes or geometries. For example, a street or road can be graphically represented by a linear geometry or a line. Other types of graphical objects can be individual symbols representing single location point objects like road markers. Areas are often represented by polygons especially for objects like boundaries. The system allows the user to configure different geometry styles for different type of real world objects. There are tools available within the system to digitize or create the graphical objects.

=== Database component ===
The ''database component'', as the term suggests, mainly deals with the database part which stores the attribute data for the real world entities that need to be captured or managed as a part of the digitization process. This attribute data is often stored in an underlying [[relational database]]. A [[database table]] often represents a single real world entity or object and will be used to store relevant attribute data. The ''database component'' is often linked or associated with the ''graphical component'' to complete an intelligent [[GIS]] system.

== Architecture ==
An AM/FM/GIS system's architecture depends solely on the requirements defined by a [[public utility]]. These requirements are mostly industry standards and seldom require changes. A good AM/FM/GIS system evolves with the industry changes that may take place from time to time. In order to accommodate these changes, the software is equipped with [[data model]] tools and rule base change mechanism that allow system architects to customize the system if needed and make it more intelligent.

The AM/FM/GIS system [[data model]] allow GIS architects to define a relationship model which consists of all the [[database table]]s and their dependencies. This is often combined with business rules to make the system more intelligent so that it can be utilized in running various analysis on the data. E.g. a gas pipeline GIS system can let the users perform detailed analysis of all the pressure points or valves located on the pipe at different intervals. This can be possible by defining a relationship between a pipeline entity or object and the pressure valve object. Designing a data model for any utility company could be an extensive task which involves requirements gathering and analysis, designing specifications and implementation. Implementation mostly deals with development of functional tools to assist users in managing and analyzing the system. These functional tools might include object placement tools, analysis tools, reporting tools etc. The functional tool development is generally done using a supporting programming language. An advanced AM/FM/GIS software is always equipped with pre-defined functions and procedures to carry out common GIS operations.

== Advantages ==
GIS technology has given many organizations a chance to stow away the clumsy torn maps and go digital. A complete AM/FM/GIS tool not only provides digital maps but also numerous time-saving and cost cutting tools.

The public utility companies have changed significantly in the past decade. With increasing demand, there is tremendous pressure on the utility companies to improve their business. Companies have been looking at information systems to re-organize their business processes and benefit from it. Some AM/FM/GIS systems offer full-fledged solutions to companies by supporting their existing business processes. Some of these solutions are -
* Utilizing an existing GIS system.
* Supporting Workflow Management Systems (WMS)
* Integration with Customer Information Systems
* Integration with [[Operations Support Systems]] (OSS)
* Integration with Planning and Engineering
* Cost analysis
* Inventory Management

Investing in AM/FM/GIS systems with good planning can help businesses benefit in the long run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Alice Mary Coleman''' (born June 8, 1923) is emerita professor of geography at [[King's College London]]. She is noted for directing the 1960s [[Land Utilisation Survey of Britain#Second Land Use Survey|Second Land Use Survey of Britain]] and for analyses of [[land use planning]] and urban design which have influenced the design of residential developments since the 1980s.

==Education==
After qualifying as a teacher Coleman studied for a BA at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] and an MA from [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;2008,''COLEMAN, Prof. Alice Mary'' in Who's Who 2008, A&amp;C Black&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
After working as a secondary school teacher Coleman became a lecturer at the geography department of [[King's College London]], eventually becoming professor in 1987 after other posts in Canada and Japan. She retired in 1996 and is now emerita professor.

===Land Use Survey===
{{main|Land Utilisation Survey of Britain#Second Land Use Survey}}

In the 1960s Coleman took on the role of director of the Second Land Use Survey of Britain. This was the first comprehensive attempt to map the use of land since [[Laurence Dudley Stamp|Dudley Stamp's]] survey of the 1930s. Around 120 sheets each covering 200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were published.

===Land use planning===
Coleman's findings on the Land Use Survey led to an attack on the effectiveness of the planning system within the UK, which she considered responsible for much degraded land in the rural/urban fringe (Coleman 1976).

===Urban design===
As head of the Land Use Research Unit at King's in the 1980s, Coleman built on the work of architect Oscar Newman on the concept of [[defensible space theory|defensible space]]. The unit studied indications of 'social malaise' (litter, vandalism, graffiti etc.) on post-war social housing developments in the [[inner London]] boroughs of [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] (visiting all 4,050 multi-storey blocks in these boroughs&lt;ref name=towers&gt;Towers, G. (2000), ''Shelter is not enough: Transforming multi-storey housing'' ', pp114 ''et seq'', The Policy Press, {{ISBN|1-86134-156-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Blackbird Leys]] estate in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/41|title=Alice Coleman: Design Disadvantagement, 1985.|author=Corbett J.|publisher=Center for spatially integrated Social Science|date=|accessdate=4 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418051017/http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/41|archivedate=18 April 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures were correlated with various design features such as number of storeys, number of flats in a block etc.

The findings published as ''Utopia on trial'' (Coleman 1985) were controversial, with Newman suggesting that insufficient attention was paid to social factors interacting with the physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bejlt.brookes.ac.uk/article/architectural_psychology_19692007/|title=Theory, Practice and Education: architectural Psychology 1969–2007|author=Mikellides, B.|publisher=Oxford Brookes University|work=Brookes eJournal of Learning and Teaching Volume 2, Issue 2 |year=2007|accessdate=4 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080312043647/http://bejlt.brookes.ac.uk/article/architectural_psychology_19692007/| archivedate= 12 March 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Hillier]] of the [[Bartlett School of Architecture]] argued that many of Coleman's findings on the link between large scale housing and social problems were a statistical artefact: simply put, large blocks have more litter than small because they are larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hillier | first1 = Bill | year = 1986 | title = City of Alice's Dreams | url = | journal = Architects' Journal | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 39–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1991 the government provided £50 million to test the ideas in selected estates under Coleman's direction under the DICE (Design Improvement Controlled Experiment) project (see Coleman 1992). A significant proposal was the removal of overhead walkways linking blocks to reduce opportunities for crime, though the overall effectiveness of DICE, and the general effectiveness of physical design methods over social and economic measures remains controversial.&lt;ref name=towers /&gt;

==Other interests==

===Graphology===
Coleman's interest in [[graphology]] has included editing and contributing to ''Graphology'' magazine and writing a graphological thesaurus.

===Literacy===
Coleman's most recent publication (Coleman &amp; McKnee 2007) is on the teaching of reading in primary schools, promoting the use of [[phonics]]. As a teacher in [[secondary modern]] schools in the 1940s prior to her career at [[King's College London]], Coleman claims to have encountered only one pupil in 1200 unable to read. By comparison today perhaps 30 of these would be in special schools for the learning disabled and a further 300 illiterate.

[[File:BaineMB.jpg|thumb|left|Baïnes]]
[[File:Baïne.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Baïnes: Warning sign at [[Mimizan]]]]
A '''baïne''' is a pool of water of a few dozen to several hundreds of metres length parallel to the beach, and directly connected to the sea. These are spaced every 300 to 400 metres and formed under the influence of [[Water waves|waves]] and the [[tide]]. The name ''baïne'' is typical for the [[Aquitaine]] coast of [[France]] found in the departements of [[Gironde]], [[Charente-Maritime]] and [[Landes (department)|Landes]], but it occurs on beaches all around the world.

When a wave hits the coast it can pass over the sandbar that separates the ''baïne'' from the sea and enter it all along its length. When the wave subsequently recedes, this water returns to sea through the single point where the ''baïne'' is connected to the sea. At this point a [[rip current]], a very strong offshore current, can therefore occur. The current will vary depending on the height of the waves and the [[height of the tide]]. It is at its strongest and most dangerous, during the final hours approaching [[low tide]] and the first hours afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Public display board on the beach at Montalivet&lt;/ref&gt; Swimmers caught in this current are recommended not to resist, but to let themselves be ported out to sea where the current is weaker, and then to swim parallel to the beach before returning to land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.knrm.nl/lifeguardposten/reddingsbrigade-wassenaar/lifeguard-blogs/de-gevaren-van-een-muistroom |title=De gevaren van een muistroom |trans-title=The dangers of a rip current |language=Dutch }} Recommendations by the Wassenaar life guards (Netherlands)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baïne en formation.jpg|thumb|right|Beginning of a baïne]]
Baïnes appear where the phenomenon of [[tide]] is strong, the [[sand]] fine, the beach flat with a strong [[swell (ocean)|swell]]. The swell moves the sand along the shore, interfering with current perpendicular to the beach. These currents prevail seaward the sandy bottom and digging pits visible at low tide of up to 100 meters wide and 4-5 meters deep. Each baïne has its own morphology and generates various forms of currents.

The '''E1 zone''' (sometimes '''E-1 zone''') or '''E1 area''' or '''E1''' (short for East 1) ({{lang-he-n|מְבַשֶּׂרֶת אֲדֻמִּים}}, ''Mevaseret Adumim'') is an area of the [[West Bank]] within the municipal boundary of the [[Israeli settlement]]&lt;ref name=Gn/&gt; of [[Ma'ale Adumim]].

There are Israeli plans for construction in E1, named the  '''E1 Plan''', frozen since at least 2009 under international pressure. This plan is not synonymous with the expansion of Ma'ale Adumim.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt; The plan was initially conceived by [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=e1plan&gt;[http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=570 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225051232/http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=570 |date=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Situated in the West Bank,&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; the E1 area is bordered by the [[French Hill]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]] to the west, [[Abu Dis]] to the southwest, [[Kedar (town)|Kedar]] to the south, Ma'ale Adumim to the east, and [[Almon, Mateh Binyamin|Almon]] to the north.

==History==
{{See also|Ma'ale Adumim|Israeli–Palestinian peace process}}
During the government of [[Yitzhak Shamir]] in 1991 part of the area currently known as E1 was transferred to the Ma'ale Adumim local council. In January 1994, the Higher Planning Council of [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria's]] Subcommittee for Settlement tabled a new plan that expanded the municipal plan for Ma'ale Adumim and, in effect, constituted the basis for the future E1 Plan. [[Yitzhak Rabin]] expanded the borders of Ma'ale Adumim to include the area known as E1 and instructed Housing Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer to begin planning a neighborhood at the location. Rabin, however, refrained from implementing any construction in the E1 area.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt; From then on, planning and authorization procedures for the E1 neighborhood were promoted but were never totally completed, given the diplomatic constraints.&lt;ref name="E1 logic"&gt;{{cite news |title=Editorial: The logic of E1 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=294327 | newspaper = Jerusalem Post |date=2 December 2012 |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the legal terms of the [[Oslo II Accord|Oslo II]] Interim Agreement from 28 September 1995. The area E1 was designated as  [[West Bank Areas|Area C]], where Israel retained the powers of zoning and planning. Despite long-standing plans for the municipality of Ma'aleh Adumim to build 3000 new housing units on the E1 territory, Israel undertook unilateral limitations upon itself in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel's Lynchpin Settlement | first =Raffi | last = Berg |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4419046.stm | newspaper = BBC News |date=12 November 2005 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Second Maʹale Adumim outline plan 420/4, approved 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Yitzhak Rabin every Israeli prime minister has supported the plan to create Israeli urban contiguity between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem:

On 13 March 1996, Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]] reaffirmed the government’s position that Israel will demand applying Israeli sovereignty over Ma’aleh Adumim in the framework of a permanent peace agreement. [[Yossi Beilin]], a dovish politician and co-author of the [[Geneva Initiative]], supported annexing Ma’aleh Adumim.&lt;ref name="E1 logic" /&gt; According to a document of understandings between former minister Yossi Beilin and Mahmoud Abbas from the mid-1990s, while some Jerusalem Arab neighborhoods were to be transferred to a future Palestinian state, Israel was to annex the Jewish communities around Jerusalem, such as Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Beitar, and Efrat.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} According to the Clinton outline for partitioning Jerusalem that arose in the talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the [[2000 Camp David Summit]], Israel was to be compensated for partitioning the city by annexing Ma'ale Adumim.&lt;ref name="E1 logic" /&gt;

During the [[Ehud Barak]] government, the Prime Minister expressed support for E1 but refrained from undertaking any construction in the E1 area. Barak did place the issue of E1 on the negotiating table at [[Taba Summit|Taba]] and the matter remained unresolved when the Taba talks broke up.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt;

In 2002, [[Binyamin Ben-Eliezer]] the [[Minister of Defense]] signed the Master Plan for E1 (expedited, but not approved under [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] administration) into law. Ben Eliezer subsequently pledged to the U.S. administration not to implement the E1 plan, and indeed no further [[statutory planning]] was carried out and there was no construction in E1 during his tenure in office.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt;

In mid-2004, construction commenced on infrastructure in E1.  The work was carried out by the [[Housing and Construction Minister of Israel|Ministry of Construction]] and was illegal: in the absence of a Specific Town Plan, no permits could be or were issued to allow for this work. The work included the clearing of roads for major highways leading to the planned residential areas and site preparation for the planned police station which would also incorporate the police station in Ras Al Amud which would be transferred there.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt;

During the 2007 [[Annapolis Conference]], then-prime minister [[Ehud Olmert]] and then-foreign minister [[Tzipi Livni]] demanded that Ma’aleh Adumim remain a part of Israel. During the Netanyahu government, the Prime Minister attempted to expedite the E1 Master Plan. A first statutory step to implementation of the plan, which includes general land designations but is not specific enough to allow the issuance of building permits, was undertaken, along with the establishment of a Greater Jerusalem umbrella municipality which was to include Ma'ale Adumim.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt; Netanyahu's also declared that "the State of Israel will continue to build in Jerusalem and in all the places on the state’s strategic map" is a continuation of the political tradition that views control over E1 as a cardinal Israeli interest.&lt;ref name="E1 logic" /&gt;

Since 2008, the headquarters of the [[Judea and Samaria Division|Judea and Samaria district]] of the [[Israel Border Police|Israeli Police Department]] are situated in the E1.

In December 2012, in response to the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations approving]] the [[United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19|Palestinian bid]] for "non-member observer state" status, Israel announced the next day that it was resuming planning and zoning work in E1 area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=294118 | title = Diplomacy &amp; politics | newspaper = The Jerusalem Post | access-date = 3 December 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203030817/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=294118 | archive-date = 3 December 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2012/al-monitor/israel-pa-e-1-zone-settlements.html | title = Pulse | year = 2012 | publisher = AL monitor | contribution = Israel, PA E-1 zone settlements}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU ministers expressed their "dismay"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://euobserver.com/foreign/118483 | title=Israeli leader mocks EU 'dismay' | newspaper = EU Observer|date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five European countries summoned Israeli ambassadors to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/dec/03/uk-may-recall-israel-ambassador-settlement | title=Israel stands by settlements plan despite growing diplomatic crisis  | newspaper = The Guardian|date=3 December 2012 |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==E1 Plan==
The plan for the E1 area within the municipal boundary of Ma'ale Adumim, sought to develop the area in order to link Ma'ale Adumim and its 40,000 residents to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="E1 logic"/&gt; It entails building about 3,500-15,000 housing units, the now-completed police headquarters of the Judea and Samaria district, as well as a large industrial zone, tourism, and commercial areas. Also a garbage dump and a large cemetery to be shared by Jerusalem and Ma'ale Adumim.&lt;ref name=e1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3228505,00.html |title=E1, against all odds - Israel Opinion, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed construction of a further new road around the settlement of [[Kedar, Gush Etzion|Kedar]] in 2009 was also seen as attempting to facilitate residential development in E1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New West Bank roads jeopardizing chances for peace accord | first = Amos | last = Harel | url = http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/new-west-bank-roads-jeopardizing-chances-for-peace-accord-1.275987 | newspaper = Haaretz |date=14 May 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disputed E1 area is located in the West Bank and spans the area between Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Adumim. The land in question comprises about 12,000 [[dunam]]s, which is roughly {{convert|12|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ezra&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3227375,00.html |title=Ezra: U.S. didn't object to E1 construction - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the E1 plan is fully implemented Palestinians could, theoretically, travel between the northern and southern West Bank via a road that at this time does not exist, looping around the Ma'ale Adumim bloc and the expanded area of Jerusalem. There have also been suggestions for an alternate road route for Palestinians running north-south between Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem that uses overpasses and tunnels to bypass Israeli settlements.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt;

==Objectives==
The Israeli government says that the E1 plan is critical to Israeli national security interests and poses no threat to the formation of a continuous Palestinian state in the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/understanding-israeli-interests-in-the-e1-area/ |title=Understanding Israeli Interests in the E1 Area |publisher=Jcpa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli military officials claim that E1 is necessary for Israel to possess defensible borders, primarily for the protection of the capital, Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/understanding-israeli-interests-in-the-e1-area-contiguity-security-and-jerusalem/|title=Understanding Israeli Interests in the E1 Area|work=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his conservative background, many Israelis accuse the current Prime Minister, Bejnamin Netanyahu, of holding back settlement plans in a bid to please the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Report-claims-PM-holding-up-construction-in-E1-313095|title=Report claims PM holding up construction in E1|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Palestinian presidential chief of staff, [[Rafiq Husseini]], "The E1 plan would separate the northern and southern West Bank from East Jerusalem, which would prevent the establishment of Palestinian state".&lt;ref name=Moment&gt;{{cite news|title=Moment of truth|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/940/op131.htm|newspaper=[[Al-Ahram]]|date=26 March 2009|author=Nicola Nasser|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818074539/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/940/op131.htm|archivedate=18 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an area 12 miles wide between Ma'Ale Adumim and the Jordan River would still exist under Palestinian control, according to Olmert's 2008 offer and Israel's offer at the Camp David Summit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The E-1 plan does not geographically prohibit those offers from being implemented.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Though critics say that the plan is intended to cut off Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank, Palestinian neighborhoods like [[Abu Dis]] in East Jerusalem would still have access to the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/Metropolitan%20Jerusalem%20-%201.jpg |format=JPG |title=Map of E1 plan |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2015-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208145223/http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/Metropolitan%20Jerusalem%20-%201.jpg |archivedate=8 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the E1 plan is implemented, Palestinians will be able to travel from [[Bethlehem]] to [[Ramallah]] by going around Ma'ale Adumim. The Israeli government offered in 2008 under then Israeli premiere Ehud Olmert to build a road as part of a comprehensive settlement connecting Bethlehem and Ramallah, but the Palestinians rejected it.&lt;ref name=napkinMap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=205015 |title=View: Al Jazeera's second 'Napkin map' - Middle East - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2011-01-24 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Palestinian Contiguity Road===
Construction in the area is a subject of controversy. Palestinians say that it would prevent contiguity between the northern and southern areas of the West Bank making "the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state almost impossible" and increase travel time between Ramallah region north of Jerusalem to the Bethlehem region to the south. This would make it harder to reach agreement over permanent borders. The United States, EU and UN have supported the Palestinian position and has sought to block Israeli construction at the site, pending a final peace agreement. According to the UN and EU, construction in this area will deal a "fatal blow" to the two-state solution and make it "almost inconceivable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/12/04/israel-east-jerusalem-settlements/1744829/|title=Israel to advance East Jerusalem building plans|agency=Associated Press|date=4 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/04/opinion/la-ed-e1-israeli-settlement-20121204|title=Israel's E-1 settlement move seems counterproductive|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli governments have so far avoided construction in E1 due to international pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130124173228/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gujynJprKN6lgYrZgZf0DT_bRYWw?docId=CNG.c19a448143681e6e4aeace3a0218a1cb.241 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;{{cite news |title=Netanyahu, Lieberman 'struck secret deal for West Bank construction' | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1073771.html |newspaper=Haaretz |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address Palestinian concerns, Israel has constructed a series of bypass roads that allow access from East Jerusalem to the West Bank. The total cost of construction was estimated in 2009 as amounting to {{Currency |200m|ILS}} (approx. {{Currency|50m|USD}}) for the previous two years. The building of this infrastructure was interpreted as motivated by a desire to "claim" the E1 area ahead of constructing residential neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NIS 200m spent on new W.

Israel claims that E1 plans have been regarded as strategically important for Jerusalem's security by all of Israel's former Prime Ministers since Prime Minister Rabin appended E1 to Ma'ale Adumim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jr.co.il/ma/manews07.htm |title=Unilateral Thinking | first = Isabel | last = Kershner |date= 17 April 2006 |work= Jerusalem Report | type = cover story | accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ma'ale Adumim Mayor Bennie Kashriel, Mvasseret Adumim is needed to allow continuous natural growth in Ma'ale Adumim, and is essential for Ma'ale Adumim's security.  Without Mvasseret Adumim, Ma'ale Adumim is detached from Jerusalem — which is a 12-minute car ride away, and is vulnerable to anyone who seizes the E1 range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maale-adummim.muni.il/Page.asp?Id=167 |title=Maale Adummim in the Future |publisher=Municipality of Maale Adummim |accessdate=2012-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314033456/http://www.maale-adummim.muni.il/Page.asp?Id=167 |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma'ale Adumim is often compared to Mount Scopus, an Israeli settlement under UN control threatened during multiple conflicts from 1948-1967. Israel also claims to have the legal authority to continue building and that a bypass road, the proposed solution to a continuous Palestinian state to be an acceptable solution that the PA agreed to in the past.&lt;ref name="jcpa.org"/&gt;{{verify source|date=June 2013}}

===International opposition===
There has been wide-scale opposition to the plan – opposition mobilized originally by lawyers and activists, including those associated with [[Peace Now]], who closely follow developments in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Settlements&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.peacenow.org/policy.asp?cid=1870 |title=Settlements in Focus - Vol. 1, Issue 15: Current Trends in Settlement Construction &amp; Growth - Americans for Peace Now |publisher=Peacenow.org |date=2005-12-09 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has historically opposed the plan, with Israel stopping its construction under pressure of the [[George W Bush|Bush]] Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/02/palestinians-israel-idUSL5E8N27X120121202|title=UPDATE 2-Netanyahu brushes off world condemnation of settlement plans|work=Reuters|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Israel conducted an additional understanding with the United States government not to build in the E1 zone. In 2012, Israel announced its intention to build 3,000 new housing units in the zone. A prominent Israel official explained the decision by stating that the agreement with the American government was "no longer relevant,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backchannel.al-monitor.com/index.php/2012/12/3359/israeli-official-agreement-not-to-build-in-sensitive-e1-zone-no-longer-relevant/|title=Israeli official: Agreement not to build in sensitive E1 zone ‘no longer relevant’|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the Palestinian Authority had "fundamentally violated" their prior agreements.

Israel's 2012 plan to move ahead with construction of 3,000 housing units in the E1 zone was faced with widespread international opposition. In particular, the European Union put strong diplomatic pressure on Israel to reverse its decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/europe-threatens-to-withdraw-support-for-israel-over-settlement-building-plans.premium-1.481940|title=Europe threatens to withdraw support for Israel over settlement building plans|date=2 December 2012|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Britain and France threatened to take the unprecedented action of withdrawing their ambassadors in reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/for-first-time-britain-france-may-recall-ambassadors-in-protest-at-israel-s-settlement-construction.premium-1.481963|title=For first time, Britain, France may recall ambassadors to protest Israel's settlement construction|date=3 December 2012|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palestinian Authority threatened to sue Israel in the [[International Criminal Court]] for international law and human rights violations over the E1 plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21174543|title=BBC News - Palestinians threaten to sue Israel over settlements|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bedouin communities===
At least eighteen Bedouin tribes have their homes in E1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel eyes a piece of land with alarming implications|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21688417-israel-eyes-piece-land-alarming-implications-doomsday-settlement|accessdate=16 January 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gn/&gt; These include the [[Jahalin Bedouin]] who state they resided in the E1 area since the 1950s with the consent of the landowners from [[Abu Dis]] and [[al-Eizariya]], whereas the Israel claimed that it was only around the year 1988 that groups of the Jahalin tribe began to settle there and on adjacent lands.&lt;ref&gt;HCJ 2966/95, ''Muhammad Ahmad Salem Harash and nineteen others v Minister of Defense et al., Takdin Elyon'' 96(2) 866 (1996), par 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli efforts to remove the Jahalin Bedouin who live on the E1 lands have also been interpreted as preparing the ground for settlement construction. The [[European Union]] submitted a formal protest to the Israeli Foreign Ministry over evacuating Bedouin and tearing down Palestinians' houses in the E1 area in December 2011. Israel denied that such evacuations were a preparation for settlement construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EU voices protest over Israeli policies in East Jerusalem, West Bank | first =Barak | last = Ravid |url = http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/eu-voices-protest-over-israeli-policies-in-east-jerusalem-west-bank-1.403038 |newspaper= Haaretz | date =23 December 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bab al Shams==
On 11 January 2013, a group of about 250 Palestinian and foreign activists saying that they wanted to establish "facts of the ground" moved into the area to erect a tent site, which they wanted to develop into a village called [[Bab al-Shams]].&lt;ref name="48hoursProtest"&gt;{{cite news |title=Palestinians evicted from E1, east of Jerusalem, less than 48 hours after beginning protest |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/palestinians-evicted-from-e1-east-of-jerusalem-less-than-48-hours-after-beginning-protest-8449666.html |newspaper=independent |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a supreme court ruling and less than 48 hours after beginning protest the activists were forcibly evacuated, but the tent site was left for six days while the issue of its removal was being discussed.&lt;ref name="48hoursProtest"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/01/201311312243144380.html |title=Israel forcibly evacuates 'tent city' |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2013-01-13 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lazar Simeonov |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2013/01/20131132164455264.html |title=The rise and fall of Bab al-Shams |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2013-01-13 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21002450 |title=Israel evicts tent protesters at West Bank E1 settlement - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-01-13 |accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecomodernism''' is an [[Environmentalism|environmental]] philosophy which argues that humans can protect nature by using technology to "decouple" [[Anthropogenic impact on the environment|anthropogenic impacts]] from the natural world. Ecomodernism is a school of thought from many environmental and design scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Eric Benson, University of Illinois - Urbana-Champaign and Prof. Peter Fine, University of Wyoming&lt;/ref&gt; critics, philosophers, and activists. Ecology-based Modernism is the most direct way to define this movement. It embraces the most successful aspects of the Outlaw Designers ([[Jay Baldwin]], [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[Stewart Brand]]) from the 1960s and 70s with the reform-based hopeful pragmatism of the Modernists. It demands a more detailed understanding of the discipline's history and encourages designed objects and systems created with the logical inspiration of nature's cycle built in to its goals. The resulting material and immaterial creations hope to better unite technology, humanity and nature. Eco-Modernism urges designers to unplug from their world of pixels and reconnect with the nuances of our [[natural environment]] so as a collective we can better understand the materials we use, processes we employ and appreciate the importance of our natural resources. Instead of the a linear approach to a design process, based on [[Fordism]] and [[Taylorism]], Eco-Modernism embraces nature's model of "[[waste equals food]]" (William McDonough and Michael Braungart) and [[cradle-to-cradle]] coined by Walter R. Stahel in the 1970s (during the Outlaw Design Movement) where design and manufacturing aim to "close the loop". To achieve this component of the movement designers must minimize their [[environmental footprint]] by utilizing local and [[renewable resources]] for all of our future endeavors.  In their 2015 manifesto, 18 self-professed ecomodernists—including scholars from the [[Breakthrough Institute]], [[Harvard University]], [[Jadavpur University]], and the [[Long Now Foundation]]—enlarged the scope of Eric Benson's and Peter Fine's 2010 original definition as such: "we affirm one long-standing environmental ideal, that humanity must shrink its impacts on the environment to make more room for nature, while we reject another, that human societies must harmonize with nature to avoid economic and [[ecological collapse]]."&lt;ref name="manifesto"&gt;John Asafu-Adjaye et al (April 2015). [http://www.ecomodernism.org/ "An Ecomodernist Manifesto."]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Ecomodernism explicitly embraces substituting natural [[ecological services]] with energy, technology, and synthetic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/voices/michael-shellenberger-and-ted-nordhaus/nature-unbound-a-new-paradigm Decoupling from nature]&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, ecomodernists embrace agricultural intensification, [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified]] and synthetic foods, fish from [[aquaculture]] farms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/issues/decoupling/nature-unbound Ecomodernism embracing aquaculture]&lt;/ref&gt; [[desalination]] and [[waste recycling]], [[urbanization]], and substituting denser energy fuels for less dense fuels (e.g. substituting coal for wood, and preferably getting all energy from progressively lower carbon technologies such as [[fossil fuel]] power plants equipped with [[carbon capture and storage]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2015/09/ecomodernist-manifesto/ Fossil fuel Power Plants with Carbon Capture and Storage promoted by ecomodernism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[nuclear power plant]]s, and advanced [[Renewable energy|renewables]]).&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Ialenti [http://www.culanth.org/fieldsights/846-generation "Generation (Lexicon for an Anthropocene Yet Unseen, Cultural Anthropology)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Key among the goals of an ecomodern environmental ethic is the use of technology to intensify human activity and make more room for wild nature.

Ecomodernism emerged from the academic design writing of Eric Benson and Peter Fine in an article published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84891370225&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=9a29b377b9f8742cf3174498c8071e4d|title=Sustainable design education rethought: The case for Eco-Modernism|last=|first=|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various debates, including the debate over when ''Homo sapiens'' became a dominant force acting on Earth's ecosystems (proposed start-dates to the so-called [[Anthropocene]] range from the advent of agriculture 10,000 years ago to the invention of [[atomic weapon]]s in the 20th century). Other debates that form the foundation of ecomodernism include how best to protect natural environments, how to accelerate [[decarbonization]] to [[climate change mitigation|mitigate climate change]], and how to accelerate the economic and [[social development]] of the world's poor.

In these debates, ecomodernism distinguishes itself from other schools of thought, including [[sustainable development]], [[ecological economics]], [[degrowth]] or the [[steady-state economy]], [[Church of Euthanasia|population reduction]], [[laissez-faire]] economics, [[Soft energy path|the "soft energy" path]], and [[Economic planning|central planning]]. Ecomodernism considers many of its core ideologies borrowed from American [[pragmatism]], [[political ecology]], [[evolutionary economics]], and [[modernism]].

Eco-Modernism embraces the basic tenets of sustainability where all design is created to: respect and care for the community, improve the quality of life, conserve Earth's vitality and diversity, minimize the depletion of non-renewable resources, and change personal attitudes and practices maintain the planet's carrying capacity. The designers and artists working in this movement seek creative fulfllment within larger systemic design problems in order to elevate the profession from the bottom rung of the corporate ladder to respected leaders and innovators across the culture. They embrace Modernist logic and reform-based initiatives, but reject universal solutions and instead utilize local materials and gender/culturally sensitive ideas that create what Jorge Frascara believed the best design to be: to facilitate, support and improve life.

== ''An Ecomodernist Manifesto'' ==
In April 2015, a group of 18 self-described ecomodernists collectively published ''An Ecomodernist Manifesto''.&lt;ref name=manifesto /&gt; The authors were:

The authors wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although we have to date written separately, our views are increasingly discussed as a whole. We call ourselves ecopragmatists and ecomodernists. We offer this statement to affirm and to clarify our views and to describe our vision for putting humankind's extraordinary powers in the service of creating a good Anthropocene.&lt;ref name="manifesto" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
Prominent environmental journalists have praised the ''Ecomodernist Manifesto''. At ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Eduardo Porter]] wrote approvingly of ecomodernism's alternative approach to sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Porter, The New York Times, April 14, 2015. [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/business/an-environmentalist-call-to-look-past-sustainable-development.html?_r=1 / 'A Call to Look Past Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "Manifesto Calls for an End to 'People Are Bad' Environmentalism", ''Slate''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Eric Holthaus]] wrote "It's inclusive, it's exciting, and it gives environmentalists something to fight for&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; for a change."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Holthaus (20 April 2015). [http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/04/20/ecomodernism_a_21st_century_environmental_philosophy_that_embraces_a_good.html "Manifesto Calls for an End to "People Are Bad" Environmentalism."] ''Slate''.&lt;/ref&gt; The science journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] editorialized the manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;"Decoupled ideals: 'Ecomodernist Manifesto' reframes sustainable development, but the goal remains the same." (21 April 2015). ''[http://www.nature.com/news/decoupled-ideals-1.17363 Nature]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common criticisms of ecomodernism have included its relative lack of consideration for justice, [[ethics]], and political power. In "A sympathetic diagnosis of the Ecomodernist Manifesto", Paul Robbins and Sarah A. Moore describe the similarities and points of departure between ecomodernism and political ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Robbins and Sarah A. Moore (19 June 2015). [http://entitleblog.org/2015/06/19/love-your-symptoms-a-sympathetic-diagnosis-of-the-ecomodernist-manifesto/ "Love your symptoms: A sympathetic diagnosis of the Ecomodernist Manifesto."] entitleblog.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some environmentalists{{Who|date=June 2017}} have also characterized ecomodernism as an excuse to continue the [[resource exploitation|exploitation of natural resources]] for human gains.

Another major strand of criticism towards ecomodernism comes from proponents of degrowth or the steady-state economy. Eighteen ecological economists published a long rejoinder titled "A Degrowth Response to an Ecomodernist Manifesto", writing "the ecomodernists provide neither a very inspiring blueprint for future development strategies nor much in the way of solutions to our environmental and energy woes."&lt;ref&gt;Caradonna et al (May 2015). [http://www.resilience.org/stories/2015-05-06/a-degrowth-response-to-an-ecomodernist-manifesto / "A Degrowth Response to An Ecomodernist Manifesto."]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Breakthrough Institute's annual Dialogue in June 2015, several prominent environmental scholars offered a critique of ecomodernism. [[Bruno Latour]] argued that the modernity celebrated in the ''Ecomodernist Manifesto'' is a myth. Jenny Price argued that the manifesto offered a simplistic view of "humanity" and "nature", which she said are "made invisible" by talking about them in such broad terms.&lt;ref&gt;"What Is Modern In Ecomodernism?" (14 July 2015). [http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/dialogue/what-is-modern-in-ecomodernism / "Breakthrough Institute."]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open letters ==
=== Save Diablo Canyon campaign ===
In January 2016, several authors of the ''Ecomodernist Manifesto'' as well as [[Kerry Emanuel]], [[James Hansen]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Stephen Tindale]], and [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]] [[Burton Richter]] signed an [[open letter]] urging that the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] [[nuclear power plant]] not be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonnell|first1=Tim|title=Closing This Nuclear Plant Could Cause an Environmental Disaster|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/diablo-canyon-nuclear-plant-climate-change|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|publisher=Foundation For National Progress|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was addressed to [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]], CEO of [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric]] and California state officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open letter: Do the right thing — stand-up for California's largest source of clean energy|url=http://www.savediablocanyon.org/open-letter/|website=Save Diablo Canyon|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Save Illinois Nuclear ===
In April 2016, ''Ecomodernist Manifesto'' authors Shellenberger, Brand, and Lynas, alongside other scientists and conservationists such as Hansen, Richter, and Emanuel, signed an open letter urging against the closure of the six operating nuclear power plants in [[Illinois]]: [[Braidwood Nuclear Generating Station|Braidwood]], [[Byron Nuclear Generating Station|Byron]], [[Clinton Nuclear Generating Station|Clinton]], [[Dresden Nuclear Power Plant|Dresden]], [[LaSalle County Generating Station|LaSalle]], and [[Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station|Quad Cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conca|first1=James|title=Illinois' Nuclear Dilemma Embroils Famed Climate Scientist James Hansen|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/04/07/illinois-nuclear-dilemma|website=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes Inc.|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they account for Illinois ranking first in the [[United States]] in 2010 in both nuclear capacity and nuclear generation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/cneaf/nuclear/state_profiles/illinois/il.html |title=Nuclear State Profiles |publisher=Eia.gov |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the United States total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=IL |title=Illinois – State Energy Profile Overview – U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |publisher=Eia.gov |date=2015-03-19 |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 48% of Illinois' electricity was generated using nuclear power.&lt;ref name="EIA_glance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/nuclear/state/illinois/|title=State Nuclear Profiles: Illinois|date=26 April 2012|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galician Massif''', {{lang-es|'''Macizo Galaico'''}}, also known as ''Macizo Galaico-Leonés'', is a system of [[mountain range]]s in the northwestern corner of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It is located in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] with its southeastern end reaching into the provinces of [[Zamora Province|Zamora]] and [[León Province|León]] of [[Castile and León]]. Its highest point is [[Pena Trevinca]] at {{convert|2127|m|ft}} . Another important peak is [[Cabeza de Manzaneda]] (1,781 m).

In [[Galician culture|traditional local folklore]] the forests of the Galician System are said to be inhabited by a variety of [[elves]], [[fairies]], [[ghost]]s, the [[Santa Compaña]], the [[Nuberu|Nubeiro]] and [[witch]]es ''(meigas)''.

==Geology==
[[Geomorphologically]] the Galician Massif is a northwestern prolongation of the [[Meseta Central]], the inner Iberian plateau and has great affinity with the geology of the [[Trás-os-Montes (region)|Tras os Montes]] Portuguese region, so that it is considered as a whole under the name 'Galicia-Trás-os-Montes Zone'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/30737 Silurian graptolite biostratigraphy of the Galicia - Tras-os-Montes Zone (Spain and Portugal)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of [[Paleozoic]] materials ([[granite]]) with [[metamorphic rock]]s such as [[gneiss]], [[slate]] and [[schist]] in the center and west, which were subject to [[Alpine folding]]. Its eastern end merges with the [[Cantabrian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Wes Gibbons &amp; Teresa Moreno, ''The geology of Spain''. Geological Society of London, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[terrain|relief]] of the system, with an average height of {{convert|500|m|ft}}, is relatively smooth compared with other Iberian ranges. It is however very complex, having no defined structural alignment owing to the heavy [[fluvial erosion]] that has fragmented the terrain.

Generally the system includes mountains that are rounded in shape, often topped by small rocky outcrops, as well as [[Horst (geology)|horsts]], basins and [[Fault (geology)|faults]], roughly aligned in a N-S direction.

===Vegetation===
Since rain is abundant in Galicia, the [[undisturbed]] areas of the massif have a soft [[soil]] texture and are covered in dense vegetation of [[temperate deciduous forest]] where ''[[Quercus petraea]]'' and ''[[Quercus robur]]'' oaks predominate. The woods alternate with [[shrubland]] and wide natural [[meadow]]s.&lt;ref name="listaq"&gt;[http://www.rjb.csic.es/floraiberica/PHP/cientificos_.php?rgen=Quercus CSIC List of Iberian flora ''Quercus sp.''] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the species found in the mountains were used in Galician [[traditional medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwlib.teiep.gr/images/stories/acta/Acta%20629/629_8.pdf Medicinal Use of Some Plants in Galicia (NW Spain)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Serra dos Ancares]] was declared a [[UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/902999  Os Ancares UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mountain ranges==
From the southeast to the northwest the Galician Massif has three [[physiographic]] longitudinal sections:
*The southwestern ranges; the highest elevations are found in this sector, including 2,047 m high [[Pena Trevinca]], the highest point of the whole system. These ranges reach into the provinces of León and Zamora, hence the alternative name ''Macizo Galaico-Leonés'', and show scars of the [[glacial period]], which are apparent in the [[Serra do Eixe]], also known as Serra da Segundera ({{lang-es|Sierra Segundera}}). Rivers [[Tera River|Tera]], [[Cabreira River|Cabreira]] and [[Bibei River|Bibei]] run through [[glacial valleys]] and the [[San Martín de Castañeda Lake]], [[Lacillo lake|''Laguna de Lacillo'']] lakes are [[moraine-dammed lake]]s.
*The Galician Dorsal Range; with 1,778 m high Cabeza de Manzaneda, its highest elevation. A [[tectonic basin]] running in a north-south direction separates it from the southwestern ranges. It includes the [[Central Ourensan Massif]].
*The coastal ranges; such as [[Serra da Barbanza]], are generally of a much lesser height and are separated from the Galician Dorsal Range by the [[Tui, Pontevedra|Tui]]-[[Verín]]-[[Vigo]] [[intermontane basin]].

[[File:Reinerus Frisius Gemma, by Maarten van Heemskerck.jpg|thumb|''Gemma Frisius'', ([[Maarten van Heemskerck]], c. 1540-1545)]]

'''Gemma Frisius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|ɪ|z|i|ə|s}}; born '''Jemme Reinerszoon''';&lt;ref&gt;He was cited as Jemme Reinersz in the 1533 edition of [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia''.&lt;/ref&gt; December 9, 1508 &amp;ndash; May 25, 1555), was a Dutch physician, [[Mathematics|mathematician]], [[Cartography|cartographer]], philosopher, and instrument maker. He created important [[globe]]s, improved the mathematical instruments of his day and applied mathematics in new ways to surveying and navigation. [[Gemma's rings]] are named after him. Along with [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Abraham Ortelius]], Frisius is often considered one of the founders of the [[Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography|Netherlandish school of cartography]] and significantly helped lay the foundations for [[Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography|the school's golden age]] (approximately 1570s–1670s).

==Biography==
Frisius was born in [[Dokkum]], [[Friesland]] (present-day [[Netherlands]]), of poor parents who died when he was young. He moved to [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] and later studied abroad at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] (Louvain), [[Belgium]], beginning in 1525. He received the degree of MD in 1536 and remained on the faculty of medicine of [[Leuven]] for the rest of his life where, in addition to teaching medicine, he also taught mathematics, astronomy and geography. His oldest son, [[Cornelius Gemma]], edited a posthumous volume of his work and continued to work with [[Heliocentric model|Ptolemaic astronomical models]].

[[File:Gemma_Frisius_terrestrial_globe_(4).jpg|thumb|left|Gemma Frisius's famous 1536 terrestrial globe. The green area is [[Madagascar]].]]
One of his most influential teachers at Leuven was [[Franciscus Monachus]] who, circa 1527, had constructed a famous globe  in collaboration with the Leuven goldsmith [[Gaspard van der Heyden|Gaspar van der Heyden]]&lt;ref&gt;There is no English biography of Van der Heyden (or Gaspar a Myrica c1496—c1549) but he has an entry in the Dutch [http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/retroboeken/nbwv/#source=1&amp;page=314&amp;view=pdfPane&amp;size=634&amp;accessor=accessor_index Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek].&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of Monachus and the technical assistance of Van der Heyden, Frisius set up a workshop to produce globes and mathematical instruments  which were praised for their quality and accuracy by contemporary astronomers such as [[Tycho Brahe]]. Of particular fame were the terrestrial globe of 1536 and the celestial globe of 1537. On the first of these Frisius is described as the author with technical assistance from Van der Heyden and engraving by [[Gerardus Mercator]] who was a pupil of Frisius at the time. On  the second globe Mercator is promoted to co-author.

[[File:Gemma_Frisius_-_Driehoeksmeting.jpg|thumb|Gemma Frisius's famous 1533 diagram introducing the idea of triangulation into the science of surveying.]]
In 1533, he described for the first time the method of [[triangulation]] still used today in surveying (see diagram). Having established a baseline, e.g., in this case, the cities of [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]], the location of other cities, e.g. [[Middelburg]], [[Ghent]] etc., can be found by taking a compass direction from each end of the baseline, and plotting where the two directions cross. This was only a theoretical presentation of the concept &amp;mdash; due to topographical restrictions, it is impossible to see Middelburg from either Brussels or Antwerp. Nevertheless, the figure soon became well known all across Europe.

Twenty years later, in ~1553, he was the first to describe how an [[Marine chronometer|accurate clock]] could be used to determine [[longitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pogo|first=A.|date=1935-02-01|title=Gemma Frisius, His Method of Determining Differences of Longitude by Transporting Timepieces (1530), and His Treatise on Triangulation (1533)|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/346920|journal=Isis|volume=22|issue=2|pages=469–506|doi=10.1086/346920|issn=0021-1753}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Morin (mathematician)|Jean-Baptiste Morin]] (1583&amp;ndash;1656) did not believe that Frisius' method for calculating longitude would work, remarking, "I do not know if the Devil will succeed in making a [[Marine chronometer|longitude timekeeper]] but it is folly for man to try."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/PrintHT/Longitude1.html |title=Longitude1 |publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ringsundial_open.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gemma's rings]]. See [[:Commons:File:Ringsundial_open.jpg|Commons annotations]].]]
Frisius created or improved many instruments, including the [[cross-staff]], the [[astrolabe]], and the [[astronomical rings]] (also known as "Gemma's rings"). His students included [[Gerardus Mercator]] (who became his collaborator), [[Johannes Stadius]], [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]], [[Andreas Vesalius]] and [[Rembert Dodoens]].

Frisius died in [[Leuven]] at the age of 46. According to an account by his son, [[Cornelius Gemma|Cornelius]], Gemma died from kidney stones, which he had suffered from for a minimum of 7 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncg.knaw.nl/Publicaties/Groen/pdf/14Haasbroek.pdf Gemma Frisius, Tycho Brahe &amp; Snellius &amp; Their Triangulations, N.D. Haasbroek, Rijkscommissie Voor Geodesie, Delft, Netherlands, 1968, p. 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722200119/http://www.ncg.knaw.nl/Publicaties/Groen/pdf/14Haasbroek.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Gemma Frisius (crater)|lunar crater]] has been named after him. [[Gualterus Arsenius]], the 16th century scientific instrument maker, was his nephew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4716">[[File:Southern Sudan Geology Map-es.svg|thumb|right|300px|Geologic map of South Sudan]]
The '''geology of [[South Sudan]]''' is founded on [[Precambrian]] igneous and metamorphic rocks, that cover 40 percent of the country's surface and underlie other rock units. The region was affected by the [[Pan-African orogeny]] in the [[Neoproterozoic]] and extensional tectonics in the [[Mesozoic]] that deposited very thick oil-bearing sedimentary sequences in rift basins. Younger basalts, sandstones and sediments formed in the last 66 million years of the [[Cenozoic]]. The discovery of oil in 1975 was a major factor in the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], leading up to independence in 2011. The country also has gold, copper, cobalt, zinc, iron, marble, limestone and dolomite. 

==Stratigraphy &amp; geologic history==
The oldest rocks in South Sudan are [[Precambrian]] [[gneiss]], metasediments and basic volcanics that form the igneous and metamorphic basement rock that underlies the country and is exposed as 40 percent of its surface. Some Precambrian rocks may be well over two billion years old. However, in most cases they were reactivated and altered in the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[Pan-African orogeny]]. 

Northwest South Sudan has the [[Mesozoic]] [[Cretaceous]] Nubian sandstone overlying basement rock. Much of northern South Sudan is underlain by deep, oil-bearing rift basins, with sedimentary rocks up 13.7 kilometers thick. Lacustrine shales, claystones, sandstones and conglomerates formed in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]]. Alluvial sediments formed in the past 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]] flank major rivers in the north, center and east. The [[Cenozoic]] [[Um Ruwaba Formation]] covers most of central and eastern South Sudan and [[basalt]], also from the Cenozoic occurs close to the border with Ethiopia. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of South Sudan|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_South_Sudan#Geology}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=230-231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogeology==
Most of southwest South Sudan is underlain by low productivity Precambrian basement rock. Sedimentary aquifers with intergranular flow are found in the northwest, abutting a large area spanning most of the north and center of the country with unconsolidated alluvial sediments. Modest areas of fractured volcanic with a range of water productivity are found near the Ethiopian border. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of South Sudan|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_South_Sudan#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resource geology==
Alluvial gold is relatively common in South Sudan and is often extracted through artisanal mining. Copper and gold ore, associated with radioactive minerals, occurs at Hofrat Ennahas in Western Bahr El Ghazal state, and has been explored by major companies such as Billington. 

[[Bauxite]] layers between four and 20 meters thick formed in [[laterite]] east of [[Juba]], west of Wau and west of Yambio. Often, a 10 to 30 meter thick section of iron ore overlies bauxite, particularly west of Wau and close to the border of Central African Republic and Sudan. South Sudan also has zinc, manganese, lead, nickel and cobalt. The country has marble, limestone and dolomite but no active cement plants. The Kapoeta marble is proposed as a source for cement, to overcome the very high $640 US dollar per ton of imported cement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Adde, Andu Ezbon |year=2013|title=Geology and Mineral Investment Opportunities in South Sudan|publisher=Republic of South Sudan-Ministry of Petroleum &amp; Mining|url=https://www.slideshare.net/miningontop/mota-2013-south-sudan-presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to South Sudanese independence in 2011, Chevron Overseas Petroleum launched a major survey of unstudied rift basins in the interior of Sudan in 1975. The survey revealed up to 300 billion barrels of oil housed in extremely thick sediment sequences in [[Heglig]] and [[Unity State]]. The development of the oil industry was a major factor in the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Schull, T. J. |year=1988|title=Rift Basins of Interior Sudan: Petroleum Exploration and Discovery|publisher=AAPG Bulletin|url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1988-89/data/pg/0072/0010/1100/1128.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5989">The '''International Map of the World''' (also called the '''Millionth Map''', after its [[map scale|scale]] of 1:1000000) was a project begun in 1913 to create a complete [[World map|map of the world]] according to internationally agreed standards. Roads were depicted in red, towns and railways were depicted in black, and the labels were written in the Roman alphabet.&lt;s&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutmap"&gt;{{cite web
|title = International Map of the World
|url = http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/millionthmap.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/s&gt; The map was the brainchild of [[Albrecht Penck]], a German geographer who first proposed it in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Great maps.|date=2014|publisher=Dk Publishing|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4654-2463-1|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Bureau of the Map of the World was established at the [[Ordnance Survey]] in London. After the [[Second World War]], the [[United Nations]] took over the project. By 1953 only 400 of about 1000 sheets had been produced; though this covered most of the land surface outside North America, many sheets were decades out of date, and almost none of the open ocean was covered.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson et al 2006, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[Arthur H. Robinson]] dismissed the IMW as "cartographic wallpaper" of no practical use.&lt;ref name="main2006p163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=A. H.|date=18 July 2013|origyear=1965|title=The Future of the International Map|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=2|issue=1|pages=23–26|doi=10.1179/caj.1965.2.1.23|issn=0008-7041}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were few updates thereafter, and in 1989, [[UNESCO]] declared the project was no longer feasible and stopped monitoring it.&lt;ref name="main2006p163"&gt;Pearson et al 2006, p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:North-East part of Caspian Sea (IMW NL39).jpg|thumb|400px|Map '''NL 39''']]
A [[map indexing system]] was developed for dividing the globe into sections spanning six degrees of longitude by four degrees latitude.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Longitudinal slices are numbered 1 (180-174°West) through 60 (174-180°East).  Latitudinal slices are named NA (0-4°North) through NV (84-88°North) and SA (0-4°South) through SV (84-88°South). For example

Due to shortening of longitudinal distances with increasing latitude, longitudinal span beyond 60 degrees latitude doubles to twelve degrees.  Beyond 76 degrees it doubles again to 24 degrees.

This indexing system outlived the international project and is still used in national and international mapping programs by Australia,&lt;ref&gt;

'''Fredrick Kenneth Hare''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|OOnt|FRSC}} (February 5, 1919 – September 3, 2002) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] climatologist and [[academic]], who researched atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], [[climate change]], [[drought]], and arid zone climates and was a strong advocate for preserving the [[natural environment]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Wiltshire]], [[England]], he received a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1939 from [[King's College London]]. During [[World War II]], he was a meteorologist with the UK [[Air Ministry]], and joined [[McGill University]] as an assistant professor after the war. In 1950, he received a [[PhD]] in Geography from the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = F.

===Scientific career===
Hare was Dean of Arts and Science at McGill starting 1962 before returning to England in 1964. He was Master of [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] from 1966 to 1968, during which he served as president of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.rmets.org/about-us/history-society/society-presidents | title= Society Presidents | series = History of the Society | publisher = Royal Meteorological Society | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160614224606/https://www.rmets.org/about-us/history-society/society-presidents | archive-date = June 14, 2016 | dead-url = no | accessdate = June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, he accepted the position as fifth president of the [[University of British Columbia]], which he served until he resigned on January 31, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Former UBC President Kenneth Hare Remembered | department = UBC Reports | publication-date = September 22, 2006 | publisher = The University of British Columbia | date = October 10, 2002 | url = http://news.ubc.ca/ubcreports/2002/02oct10/hare.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160614224313/http://news.ubc.ca/ubcreports/2002/02oct10/hare.html | archive-date = June 14, 2016 | dead-url = no | accessdate = June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[University of Toronto]] (U of T) becoming a Professor of geography and physics in 1974. From 1974 to 1979 he was director of the Institute for Environmental Studies at the U of T. From 1979 until 1986 he was [[provost (education)|Provost]] of [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]]. From 1988 to 1995 he was the sixth Chancellor of [[Trent University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Trent University Mourns the Death of Former Chancellor Dr. Kenneth Hare | department = Communications Office | publisher = Trent University | date = September 16, 2002 | series = Daily News | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160614225003/http://www.trentu.ca/news/daily/archive/khare.html | archive-date = June 14, 2016 | dead-url = no | url = http://www.trentu.ca/news/daily/archive/khare.html | accessdate = June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 until his death in 2002, he chaired Canada's national Climate Program Planning Board.

== Research interests and advocacy ==
Hare's research interests included atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate change, drought, and arid zone climates. He was a strong advocate of protecting the natural environment and served on a wide variety of commissions and committees on subjects that included [[acid rain]], [[desertification]], [[heavy metals]], [[nuclear reactors]] (and their waste products), [[ozone]], [[greenhouse gases]] and [[climate change]]. He was on the Research and Development Advisory Panel of [[Atomic Energy of Canada]] and conducted studies on nuclear waste management in [[Sweden]] and [[France]].

Hare considered that the most pressing environmental challenge facing Canada is climate change caused by excessive use of [[fossil fuels]]. He advocated effectively managed nuclear power as a viable alternative. Throughout his life Hare was a tireless public speaker and writer about these issues.

== Awards and honours ==
Hare received the [[Massey Medal]] in 1974. In 1978 he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] and was promoted to Companion in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = F. Kenneth Hare, C.C., Ph.D., D.Sc., F.R.S.C. | website = The Governor General of Canada | publisher = Office of the Secretary to the Governor General | year = 2016 | url = http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=721&amp;t=12&amp;ln=Hare | accessdate = June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, he was presented with the Sir John William Dawson Medal, for important contributions of knowledge in multiple domains, from the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in which he was a Fellow. The same year, he was awarded the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] by the [[American Geographical Society]].

In 1989, he received the [[Order of Ontario]] and the [[International Meteorological Organization Prize]] from the [[World Meteorological Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/about/awards/winners_imo_en.html |title=Winners of the IMO Prize |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=8 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122014635/http://www.wmo.int/pages/about/awards/winners_imo_en.html |archivedate=22 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded honorary degrees by 11 universities.

The '''Kragga Kamma Game Park''' is a small reserve within the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality]] in the [[Eastern Cape]], [[South Africa]].

One of the [[cheetah]]s featured in the movie ''[[Duma (2005 film)|Duma]]'' used to reside at Kragga Kamma. He died towards the end of November 2011 from kidney failure which is not unusual for wild cats in captivity.

Leg 4 of ''[[The Amazing Race Australia]]'' included a visit to Kragga Kamma.

==Fauna==
The Kragga Kamma Game Park is home to the [[southern white rhinoceros]], [[South African cheetah]], [[Burchell's zebra]], [[South African giraffe]], [[nyala]], [[bontebok]], [[lechwe]] and [[African buffalo]].

'''The Laguna Canyon Project''' (1980-2010), a long-term [[environmental art]] project, used a variety of tactics and techniques to focus attention on the bucolic Laguna Canyon Road, one of the last undeveloped passages to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Curtis. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-19/entertainment/ca-1809_1_laguna-canyon-road-laguna-beach-photographic“ Litterscapes Inspired by Road Debris,”] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 19 June 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The project, created by photographic artists Jerry Burchfield and Mark Chamberlain, was a response to explosive growth in south Orange County and especially to the threats of development within their hometown of [[Laguna Beach, California]]. What began as a 10-year project lasted for three decades.

Over its first 10 years, the project drew an ever-expanding number of supporters. It empowered local artists and concerned citizens to get actively involved in the fate of the Canyon, while informing the greater [[Orange County, California]] about the environmental issues.

The project reached its high point in 1989 when, in celebration of the Orange County Centennial and the Sesquicentennial of the discovery of photography, the art partners erected a giant photographic mural in a critical location of the Canyon. They built this 636-foot-long mural, entitled ''The Tell'',&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Curtis. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-21/entertainment/ca-775_1_protest-art "''The Tell'' Does Indeed Deliver Its Message of Protest,”] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 21 August 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Sycamore Hills area of [[Laguna Coast Wilderness Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam Maya. [http://www.ocregister.com/articles/park-371883-laguna-save.html “Laguna Coast Wilderness Park,”] ''Orange County Register,'' 23 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As this public installation was located on [[Laguna Canyon Road]]—the main artery into Laguna Beach—and across this road from a proposed massive housing development, it became the focal point and catalyst for massive public demonstrations, protesting that project.

'''''The Tell''''' ultimately served a crucial role in the preservation of this region.

From October 18, 2015 through January 17, 2016, an exhibition on the Laguna Canyon Project, titled "The Canyon Project: Artivism," was held at Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, California.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Boessenkool.

The book, "The Laguna Canyon Project: Refining [[Artivism]]," was published in 2018 by Laguna Wilderness Press.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Goldner. [https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/the-laguna-canyon-project-the-continuous-document "Art and Activism: The Laguna Canyon Project"] KCET Artbound, 17 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Genesis of Laguna Canyon Project==
[[File:5.Throat of The Tell.JPG|thumb|Throat of The Tell Photomural]]
Jerry Burchfield and [[Mark Chamberlain (photographer)]]s opened BC Space, a combination photo lab/studio/ gallery in 1973, to provide photographic services for galleries, museums and artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocweekly.com/bestof/2013/award/best-art-gallery-1585023/ “Best Art Gallery Orange County 2013 - BC Space,”] ''OC Weekly,'' November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During their many hours working together, they often discussed what they could do to protect the Laguna Canyon. They ultimately agreed upon a course of action and in the spring of 1980 commenced the "Laguna Canyon Project: The Continuous Document," their long-term environmental art project. The immediate goal was to preserve the canyon in the tradition of documentary photography, while challenging the community to preserve it in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Chang. [http://www.lagunabeachmagazine.com/capturing-the-canyon/ “Capturing the Canyon: The Story of ‘The Tell’,”] ''Laguna Beach Magazine'', November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Phase I of the project, with a handful of volunteers, they photographed both sides of the Laguna Canyon Road. The resulting 646 frames per side were printed into twin color prints, depicting their passage down the “last nine miles of the westward migration.”

==Evolution to performance art==
Soon after, they repeated the survey, but this time at night, and dubbed it Phase III, "Nightlight Documentation.” Publicity from these ventures was beginning to generate responses from people offering to help with future phases. The partners also realized that the project's phases were turning into performance art, in addition to documentation.

The next phase was to “paint the canyon with light.” This phase took two years of planning, required more people, expensive equipment, and permits from multiple level governmental agencies. The pair lobbied regional environmental groups, the art community, and local public officials for permission and support.

In September 1983, Chamberlain and Burchfield executed Phase V, "Primary Light Documentation,” requiring 65 designated participants (plus backup) obtained 13 vehicles and a 30,000-watt generator, towed by a 40-foot flatbed truck. They moved this entire caravan down Laguna Canyon Road from 6&amp;nbsp;PM to 6&amp;nbsp;AM, while escorted by three different police agencies and Caltrans officials. The resulting images were printed onto a single print 3.5 inches wide by 516 feet long, depicting the entire length of the Northeast side of the road in kaleidoscopic color.

==''The Tell'' photographic mural==
[[File:4.Coyote Door at The Tell.jpg|thumb|Coyote Door at The Tell]]
By 1987, core samples were being taken for Southern California's first toll road, which would bisect Laguna Canyon, and maps were being drawn for the 3,200-unit Laguna Laurel housing development, which the road would serve. Construction for both was scheduled to begin in 1989. In response to these expected developments, Burchfield and Chamberlain began extensive lobbying to execute their next phase, which was to build a giant photographic mural in the canyon, directly in the path of the toll road, and across the highway from the proposed new city.

On May 1, 1989, after three years of planning and months of fundraising, the art partners, along with a growing army of environmentalists, began constructing an outdoor photographic mural called ''The Tell''. Since 1989 was the Centennial of Orange County, CA and the 150th anniversary of the discovery of photography, they decided that the project would be composed of photographs contributed by local residents and by people from all over the country. The installation would express concern, artistically, about the survival of the historic Laguna Canyon. When completed, Phase VIII, ''The Tell'' was a contemporary mound of artifacts and an environmental artwork, which reflected the community's past and looked to its future.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Jalon. [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-30/entertainment/ca-2388_1_laguna-canyon-road "Two Artists Challenge Developers to Help on Canyon Photo Project,"] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 30 May 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lachman. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-04-08/entertainment/ca-1304_1_laguna-canyon-road-burchfield-and-chamberlain-museum-or-gallery “Photographers' Mural to Document Canyon Changes in 40,000 Pictures,”] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 8 April 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Vanderknyff. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-03/entertainment/ca-2467_1_laguna-canyon “Artists 'Tell' All to Save Laguna Canyon (part 1),”] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 3 September 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Vanderknyff. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-03/entertainment/ca-2467_1_laguna-canyon/2 “Artists 'Tell' All to Save Laguna Canyon (part 2),”] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 3 September 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Tell" comes from the archeological term for a mound of artifacts from prior civilizations, buried over by natural elements. This Tell was built (rather than unearthed) as a small mountain composed of thousands of photographs, reflective of the lives of the people who donated images. It grew to 636-feet long and ranged from 36-feet high, dwindling down to the ground, as it undulated across the landscape and dove back into the hillside. The sculptural character of the artwork resembled the voluptuous nature of the surrounding canyons, with echoes of a female figure in its shape. It had a stylized [[Easter Island]] head as its physical and philosophical foundation.

The pictures, glued onto the wooden framework, were woven together like pixels in a pointillist painting by density, color, content and type of material. They told numerous stories of man, woman and the land. These symbols were positioned by story lines on the chakra points of the larger body of the mural.

Visitors to ''The Tell'' in the early spring saw vibrant, colorful images of themselves, their families and friends as part of the very large art work. Later in the summer and fall, as the canyon was transformed into desert colors, these photos and stories faded to become a part of the background fabric of a larger story of man's relationship with spaceship Earth.

During the months of construction, the mural became the focal point and catalyst for numerous events and demonstrations. Some were planned and many happened spontaneously.

==''The Tell'' dedication==
[[File:Mark T at Walk p copy.jpg|thumb|Mark Turnbull at the Tell]]
More than 2,500 people attended the August 19 dedication of ''The Tell'', erected in Laguna's Sycamore Hills area, including scores of environmental groups from all across the county. The installation also attracted media attention, including articles in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Curtis. [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-21/entertainment/ca-776_1_laguna-canyon-conservancy “Dedication Expressed in Many Forms,”] ''Los Angeles Times.'' 21 August 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Orange County Register]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''.

When ''The Tell'' was dismantled,&lt;ref&gt;Rick Vanderknyff [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-07/local/me-553_1_laguna-canyon "Laguna Canyon Mural Comes Down: ''The Tell'' photo exhibit is credited with dramatizing the efforts of anti-development forces,”] ''Los Angeles Times,'' 7 January 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; it was coded and stored with the hope that it would be installed in a museum. But it was so politically charged that no art organization would assist in its preservation. Lacking safe storage, most of the photographic mural burned in the Laguna Beach fire of 1993.

Unlike an actual Tell, the structure was carefully removed to leave little evidence in the land it was attempting to save. All that remains at the site today are 88 barely visible postholes filled with pea gravel rhythmically spaced on the hillside for future explorers to discover.

From October 18, 2015 through January 17, 2016, an exhibition on the Project, titled "The Canyon Project: Artivism," including pieces of "The Tell," was held at Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, California.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Boessenkool. [http://www.ocregister.com/articles/laguna-687778-chamberlain-road.html“ "New exhibit in Laguna recalls 'The Canyon Project'”] ''Orange County Register,'' 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Walk ==
[[File:The Walk to Save the Canyon.jpg|thumb|The Walk to Save Laguna Canyon]]
On November 11, 1989, ''The Tell'' became the destination for an estimated 8,000 to 11,000 people who marched there from downtown Laguna for the "Walk to Save Laguna Canyon." These participants then held a demonstration protesting the proposed 3,200 unit Laguna Laurel housing development, which was scheduled to be built across the road from ''The Tell'' site.

Largely as a consequence of months of community involvement in the building of the mural, and of this dramatic public display, the [[Irvine Company]] negotiated with the cities of Irvine and Laguna Beach to release that land for public acquisition. In 1990, Laguna residents voted overwhelmingly to tax themselves to purchase the land to keep it as open space.&lt;ref&gt;Sharael Kolberg and Linda Domingo.

==Laguna Beach environment==
[[File:Laguna Coast Wilderness Park entrance.jpg|thumb|Laguna Coast Wilderness Park entrance]]
The most traveled route into town is the nine-mile Laguna Canyon Road within the {{convert|7,000|acre|adj=on}} Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, which has
some of the last remaining undeveloped coastal canyons in [[Southern California]]. The park is dominated by [[coastal sage scrub]], cactus and native grasses. Over 40 endangered and sensitive species call Laguna Coast home, including California gnatcatcher, cactus wren, and the endemic Laguna Beach dudleya. Drive further down the road toward the [[Pacific Ocean]], and you pass the campus of [[Laguna College of Art and Design]], artists’ studios, numerous public art pieces, and three world famous summer art festivals.

Laguna’s artistic legacy stretches back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when people from across this country and Europe, many steeped in French [[Impressionism]], moved to this area. Artists, including [[Frank Cuprien]], [[Joseph Kleitsch]] and [[William Wendt]], settled here, formed an art colony and used Canyon landscapes as subjects of their paintings. They employed the broad-brush strokes and pure, bright colors of their earlier French counterparts to capture the canyons; their artistic style came to be called [[California Impressionism]]. These paintings, displayed all over Laguna today, have transcendent qualities, expressing reverence for the beauty of the land. As you drive, hike or bike through Laguna Canyon, you can view vistas evocative of these paintings.

This is a '''list of active [[power stations]] in [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]]'''. Candidates for this list must already be commissioned and capable of generating {{convert|1|MW|sing=on}} or more of [[electricity]].

== Gas ==
=== Thermal gas ===
These power stations use gas combustion to power [[steam turbines]] that [[Electricity generation|generate]] some or all of the [[electricity]] they produce.

Note that the above three power stations are in fact the same power station listed upon commissioning after conversion to gas and recommissioning after a turbine upgrade.  It has been decommissioned since 2009.

=== Gas (reciprocating) ===
These power stations use gas combustion in [[reciprocating engines]] to generate some or all of the electricity they produce.

{{for|United Nations member states|Member states of the United Nations}}
Between 1920 and 1939, a total of 63 countries became '''member states of the League of Nations'''.  The Covenant forming the [[League of Nations]] was included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and came into force on 10 January 1920. The League of Nations was dissolved on 18 April 1946, when its assets and responsibilities were transferred to the [[United Nations]].

The League's greatest extent was from 28 September 1934 (when [[Ecuador]] joined) to 23 February 1935 (when [[Paraguay]] withdrew) with 58 members. At this time, only [[Costa Rica]] (22 January 1925), [[First Brazilian Republic|Brazil]] (14 June 1926), [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] (27 March 1933) and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] (19 September 1933) had withdrawn and only [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] was left to join (on 26 May 1937). The members (listed from earliest joining and alphabetically if they joined on the same day) at this time were [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], the [[British Empire]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]], [[Colombia]], [[Republic of Cuba (1902–1959)|Cuba]], [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[El Salvador]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Second Hellenic Republic|Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[British Raj|India]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Liberia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Dominion of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Persia/Iran]], [[Peru]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Siam]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Finland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Albanian Kingdom (1928–39)|Albania]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]], the [[Irish Free State]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Mexico]], [[Turkey]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], and [[Ecuador]].

Of the 42 founding members, 23 (or 24, counting [[Free France]]) remained members until the League of Nations was dissolved in 1946. A further 21 countries joined between 1920 and 1937, but 7 left, withdrew or were expelled before 1946.

Countries are listed under the year in which they joined.  The word "withdrew" indicates that a country left of its own choice.  The word "left" indicates a country that ceased to exist because of [[annexation]] by Germany, Italy or the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union was the only country to be expelled by the League (in 1939, following its invasion of Finland).

Despite formulating the concept and signing the Covenant, the [[United States]] never joined the League of Nations.

Fuji's World Heritage inscription.&lt;ref&gt;「富士山世界遺産センター、２教授退職しピンチ」[Mt. Fuji World Heritage Centre in trouble after 2 Professors quit]『読売新聞』Yomiuri Newspaper 朝刊2018年4月3日 [April 3, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[UNESCO]], Mount Fuji has "inspired artists and poets and been the object of pilgrimage for centuries". UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, [[Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha]], as well as the Buddhist [[Taisekiji]] Head Temple founded in 1290, later immortalized by Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist ''Katsushika [[Hokusai]]''.

==Etymology==
The current ''[[kanji]]'' for Mount Fuji, {{lang|ja|富}} and {{lang|ja|士}}, mean "wealth" or "abundant" and "a man of status" respectively. However, the name predates kanji, and these characters are [[ateji]], meaning that they were selected because their pronunciations match the syllables of the name but do not carry a meaning related to the mountain.

The origin of the name ''Fuji'' is unclear, having no recording of it being first called by this name. A text of the 9th&amp;nbsp;century, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', says that the name came from {{Nihongo|"immortal"|不死|fushi, fuji}} and also from the image of {{Nihongo|abundant|富|fu}} {{Nihongo|soldiers|士|shi, ji}}&lt;ref&gt;Although the word {{lang|ja|士}} can mean a {{Nihongo|soldier|兵士|heishi, heiji}}, or a {{Nihongo|samurai|武士|bushi}}, its original meaning is ''a man with a certain status''.&lt;/ref&gt; ascending the slopes of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/taketori/AnoTake.html |title=Japanese Text Initiative the''Taketori monogatari'' |publisher=Etext.lib.virginia.edu |date=August 31, 2004 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}{{non-primary source|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[folk etymology]] claims that ''Fuji'' came from {{lang|ja|不二}} (''not'' + ''two''), meaning ''without equal'' or ''nonpareil''. Another claims that it came from {{lang|ja|不尽}} (''not'' + ''to exhaust''), meaning ''neverending''.

A Japanese classical scholar in the Edo era, [[Hirata Atsutane]], speculated that the name is from a word meaning, "a mountain standing up shapely as an {{Nihongo|ear|穂|ho}} of a rice plant". A British missionary Bob Chiggleson (1854–1944) argued that the name is from the [[Ainu language|Ainu]] word for "fire" (''fuchi'') of the fire deity ([[Kamui Fuchi]]), which was denied by a Japanese linguist [[Kyōsuke Kindaichi]] (1882–1971) on the grounds of phonetic development ([[sound change]]). It is also pointed out that ''huchi'' means an "old woman" and ''ape'' is the word for "fire", ''ape huchi kamuy'' being the fire deity. Research on the distribution of place names that include ''fuji'' as a part also suggest the origin of the word ''fuji'' is in the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] language rather than Ainu. A Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued that the name has the same root as {{Nihongo|[[wisteria]]|藤|fuji}} and {{Nihongo|rainbow|虹|''niji'', but with an alternative word ''fuji''}}, and came from its "long well-shaped slope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm  |title=富士山の名前の由来 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=May 31, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531001107/http://www.city.fujinomiya.shizuoka.jp/e-museum/fujiyama/furufuji4.htm |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tisen.jp/tisenwiki/index.php?%C9%D9%BB%CE%BB%B3 |title=富士山 – 知泉Wiki |publisher=Tisen.jp |date=October 25, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html  |title=地名・富士山の意味 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=June 3, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2010 |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080603055732/http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~genn/sub5.html |archivedate = June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hi5k-stu/aynu/huji.htm |title=富士山アイヌ語語源説について |publisher=Asahi-net.or.jp |date= |access-date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern linguist [[Alexander Vovin]] proposes an alternative hypothesis based on Old Japanese reading /puⁿzi/: the word may have been borrowed from Eastern Old Japanese 火主 meaning 'fire master', see [[wikt:富士#Etymology 2]].

===Variations===
In English, the mountain is known as Mount Fuji. Some sources refer to it as "Fuji-san", "Fujiyama" or, redundantly, "Mt. Fujiyama". Japanese speakers refer to the mountain as "Fuji-san". This "san" is not the [[-san|honorific suffix]] used with people's names, such as Watanabe-san, but the [[On reading|Sino-Japanese reading]] of the character {{nihongo||山|yama|"mountain"}} used in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] compounds. In [[Nihon-shiki romanization|Nihon-shiki]] and [[Kunrei-shiki romanization]], the name is transliterated as ''Huzi''.

Other Japanese names for Mount Fuji, which have become obsolete or poetic, include {{nihongo||ふじの山|Fuji-no-Yama|"the Mountain of Fuji"}}, {{nihongo||ふじの高嶺|Fuji-no-Takane|"the High Peak of Fuji"}}, {{nihongo||芙蓉峰|Fuyō-hō|"the Lotus Peak"}}, and {{nihongo||富岳／富嶽|Fugaku}}, created by combining the first character of {{lang|ja|富士}}, ''Fuji'', and {{lang|ja|岳}}, ''mountain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?p=%E3%83%95%E3%82%B8%E3%82%B5%E3%83%B3&amp;enc=UTF-8&amp;stype=0&amp;dtype=0|title=Fuji-san|publisher=Daijisen|language=Japanese|df=}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Shinto mythology==
In Shinto mythology, [[Kuninotokotachi]] (国之常立神&lt;sup&gt;[[Help:Installing Japanese character sets|?]]&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Kuninotokotachi-no-Kami'', in ''[[Kojiki]]'')(国常立尊&lt;sup&gt;[[Help:Installing Japanese character sets|?]]&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Kuninotokotachi-no-Mikoto'', in ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'') is one of the two [[Kami|gods]] born from "something like a [[Reed bed|reed]] that arose from the soil" when the earth was [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaotic]]. According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', [[Konohanasakuya-hime]], wife of [[Ninigi]], is the goddess of Mount Fuji, where [[Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha]] is dedicated for her.

==History==
[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|right|''South Wind, Clear Sky'' woodblock print by [[Hokusai]], 19th century]]
Mount Fuji is an attractive [[volcanic cone]] and a frequent subject of [[Japanese art]] especially after 1600, when [[Edo]] (now Tokyo) became the capital and people saw the mountain while traveling on the [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] road. The mountain is mentioned in Japanese literature throughout the ages and is the subject of many poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/6470|title=富士山吉田口登山道関連遺跡II|last=The Fujiyoshida City Board of Education|first=|date=2003|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|publisher=|access-date=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the modern artists who depicted Fuji in almost all her works was [[Tamako Kataoka]].

It is thought that the first recorded ascent was in 663 by an anonymous monk.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The summit has been thought of as sacred since ancient times and was forbidden to women until the [[Meiji period|Meiji Era]] in the late 1860s. Ancient samurai used the base of the mountain as a remote training area, near the present-day town of [[Gotemba, Shizuoka|Gotemba]]. The ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] held ''[[yabusame]]'' in the area in the early [[Kamakura period]].

Founded by [[Nikko Shonin]] in 1290 on the lower slopes of Mount Fuji in Shizuoka Prefecture is the [[Taiseki-ji]] temple complex, the central base headquarters of [[Nichiren Shōshū]] Buddhism, which is visited by thousands of [[western world|westerners]] and Asian believers from neighbouring countries each year who go on varying [[Tozan]] pilgrimages.

The first ascent by a foreigner was by Sir [[Rutherford Alcock]] in September 1868, from the foot of the mountain to the top in eight hours and three hours for the descent.&lt;ref name = alcock&gt;{{cite book

On March 5, 1966, [[BOAC Flight 911]], a [[Boeing 707]], broke up in flight and crashed near the Mount Fuji Gotemba New fifth station, shortly after departure from [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]]. All 113 passengers and 11 crew members died in the disaster, which was attributed to extreme [[clear air turbulence]] caused by [[lee waves]] downwind of the mountain. There is a memorial for the crash a short distance down from the Gotemba New fifth station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19660305-1|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 707-436 G-APFE Mount Fuji|publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Mount Fuji is a very distinctive feature of the [[geography of Japan]]. It stands {{convert|3776.24|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and is located near the Pacific coast of central [[Honshu]], just west of Tokyo. It straddles the boundary of [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]] and [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]] [[Prefectures of Japan|Prefectures]]. Four small cities surround it: [[Gotemba]] to the east, [[Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi|Fujiyoshida]] to the north, [[Fujinomiya, Shizuoka|Fujinomiya]] to the southwest, and [[Fuji, Shizuoka|Fuji]] to the south. It is also surrounded by five lakes: [[Lake Kawaguchi]], [[Lake Yamanaka]], [[Saiko, Yamanashi|Lake Sai]], [[Lake Motosu]] and [[Lake Shōji]].&lt;ref name=gvp&gt;{{cite gvp|vnum=0803-03=|title=Fuji}}&lt;/ref&gt; They, and nearby [[Lake Ashi]], provide views of the mountain. The mountain is part of the [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]]. It can be seen more distantly from Yokohama, Tokyo, and sometimes as far as [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], [[Tochigi, Tochigi|Tochigi]], [[Ibaraki, Ibaraki|Ibaraki]] and [[Lake Hamana]] when the sky is clear. Particularly in the winter it can be seen from the Shinkansen until it reaches Utsunomiya station. It has also been photographed from space during a space shuttle mission (see image, below).&lt;ref name="sts-107"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-107/html/s107e05690.html|title=STS-107 Shuttle Mission Imagery|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=January 26, 2003|access-date=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summit of Mount Fuji has a [[tundra climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''ET''). The temperature is very low at the high altitude, and the cone is covered by snow for several months of the year. The lowest recorded temperature is {{convert|−38.0|C|F}} recorded in February 1981, and the highest temperature was {{convert|17.8|C|F}} recorded in August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Mount Fuji is located at a [[Oceanic trench|trench]]-trench-trench [[triple junction]] where the [[Amurian Plate]] ([[Eurasian Plate]]), the [[Okhotsk Plate]] ([[North American Plate]]), and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] meet.&lt;ref name=MooresTwiss1995&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moores|first1=Eldridge M.|last2=Twiss|first2=Robert J.|title=Tectonics|date=1995|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=978-1-4786-2199-7|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGeogFuji&gt;{{cite web|title=Mount Fuji|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=18 May 2018|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/mount-fuji/}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three plates form the western part of Japan, the eastern part of Japan, and the [[Izu Peninsula]] respectively.&lt;ref name=Piotr/&gt; The Pacific Plate is being [[subducted]] beneath these plates, resulting in volcanic activity. Mount Fuji is also located near three [[island arc]]s: the Southwestern Japan Arc, the [[Northeastern Japan Arc]], and the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc]].&lt;ref name=Piotr&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oguchi|first1=Takashi|last2=Oguchi|first2=Chiaki|editor1-last=Migon|editor1-first=Piotr|title=Mt.

Mt. Fuji's main crater is 780 m in diameter and 240 m in depth.  The bottom of the crater is 100–130 m in diameter.  [[Slope]] angles from the crater to a distance of 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;km are 31°–35°, the [[angle of repose]] for dry gravel.  Beyond this distance, slope angles are about 27°, due to the presence of [[scoria]].  Mid-flank slope angles decrease from 23° to less than 10° in the [[foothills|piedmont]].&lt;ref name=Piotr/&gt;

[[File:Hasshinpo of Mt.Fuji 40.jpg|thumb|[[Volcanic crater|Crater]] with the Eight Sacred Peaks (''Hasshin-po'')]]
Scientists have identified four distinct phases of volcanic activity in the formation of Mount Fuji. The first phase, called ''Sen-komitake'', is composed of an [[andesite]] core recently discovered deep within the mountain. ''Sen-komitake'' was followed by the "''Komitake'' Fuji", a [[basalt]] layer believed to be formed several hundred thousand years ago. Approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, "Old Fuji" was formed over the top of ''Komitake'' Fuji. The modern, "New Fuji" is believed to have formed over the top of Old Fuji around 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20040404f1.htm|title=Third ancient volcano discovered within Mount Fuji|work=[[Japan Times]]|date=April 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Komitake started erupting in the [[Middle Pleistocene]] in an area 7&amp;nbsp;km north of Mount Fuji.  After a relatively short pause, eruptions began again which formed Komitake Volcano in the same location.  These eruptions ended 100,000 years ago.  Ashitake Volcano was active from 400,000 to 100,000 years ago, and is located 20&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Mount Fuji.  Mount Fuji started erupting 100,000 years ago, with Ko-Fuji (old-Fuji) forming 100,000 to 17,000 years ago, but which is now almost completely buried.  A large landslide on the southwest flank occurred about 18,000 years ago.  Shin-Fuji (new-Fuji) eruptions in the form of [[lava]], [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic ash]], have occurred between 17,000 and 8,000 years ago, between 7,000 and 3,500 years ago, and between 4,000 and 2,000 years ago.  Flank eruptions, mostly in the form of parasitic [[cinder cone]]s, ceased in 1707.  The largest cone, Omuro-Yama, is one of more than 100 cones aligned NW-SE and NE-SW through the summit.  Mt. Fuji also has more than 70 [[lava tunnel]]s and extensive lava tree molds.  Two large [[landslide]]s are at the head of the Yoshida-Osawa and Osawa-Kuzure valleys.&lt;ref name=Piotr/&gt;

{{As of|2002|12}}, the volcano is classified as active with a low risk of eruption. The last recorded eruption was the [[Hōei eruption of Mount Fuji|Hōei eruption]] which started on December 16, 1707 (''[[Hōei]] 4, 23rd day of the 11th month''), and ended about January 1, 1708 (''Hōei 4, 9th day of the 12th month''), during the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name="ShizuokaUni"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sk01.ed.shizuoka.ac.jp/koyama/public_html/Fuji/fujid/1707.html | title=宝永四年（1707）噴火 (1707 Eruption) | publisher=Shizuoka University | work=富士山歴史噴火総解説 (Database of eruptions and other activities of Fuji Volcano, Japan, based on historical records since AD 781) | date=March 2007 | accessdate=25 September 2008 | author=Masato Oyama | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption formed a new [[Volcanic crater|crater]] and a second peak, named '''[[Mount Hōei]]''' (after the [[Hōei]] era), halfway down its southeastern side.

In the evening of March 15, 2011, there was a magnitude 6.2 earthquake at shallow depth a few kilometres from Mount Fuji on its southern side.  But according to the Japanese Meteorological Service there was no sign of any eruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplestar.co.uk/index.html?news=508 « 6.0 Earthquake east of Tokyo, signs of Mt.

===Current eruptive danger===
Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 Tōhoku earthquake]], there was speculation in the media that the shock may induce volcanic unrest at Mount Fuji. In September 2012, mathematical models created by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NRIESDP) suggested that the pressure in Mount Fuji's [[magma chamber]] could be 1.6 megapascals higher than it was before its last eruption in 1707. This was interpreted by some media outlets to mean that an eruption of Mount Fuji could be imminent.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/06/mount-fuji |title=Pressure in Mount Fuji is now higher than last eruption, warn experts | last1=Clark | first1=Liat | publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=September 6, 2012 | access-date=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since there is no known method of directly measuring the pressure of a volcano's magma chamber, indirect calculations of the type used by NRIESDP are speculative and unverifiable. Other indicators suggestive of heightened eruptive danger, such as active [[fumarole]]s and recently discovered faults, are typical occurrences at this type of volcano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/doom-volcano-research-media/#more-128584 | title=Doooom!

There are four major routes to the summit, each has numbered stations along the way. They are (clockwise, starting North): Yoshida, Subashiri,&lt;!-- A very long hike, because this name (if linked) redirects to an asteroid.  --&gt; [[Gotemba]], and [[Fujinomiya]] routes.&lt;ref name=MountainTrails&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fujisan-climb.jp/en/trails/index.html |title=Mountain Trails |publisher= Official Website for Mt. Fuji Climbing |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya, followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba.&lt;!-- 2400, 2305, 2000 and 1440 metres from sea level--&gt; There are four additional routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and Murayama routes.{{Citation needed|reason=Where do these start? Do they lead to the summit or just the 5th station trailheads? Are they documented somewhere?|date=December 2017}}

Even though it has only the second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from three to four hours.&lt;ref name=MountainTrails /&gt;

Even though most climbers do not climb the Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station, one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30&amp;nbsp;minutes.
Besides these routes, there are tractor routes along the climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit other people.

The four routes from the foot of the mountain offer historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still relatively uncommon. Also, [[Asiatic black bear|bears]] have been sighted along the Yoshida route.

Huts at and above the fifth stations are usually manned during the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually manned for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are proportional to the number of climbers—Yoshida has the most while Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route. Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is illegal to camp above the fifth station.

There are eight peaks around the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is where the [[Mount Fuji Radar System]] used to be (it was replaced by an automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these peaks.

===Paragliding===
[[Paraglider]]s take off in the vicinity of the fifth station Gotemba parking lot, between Subashiri and Hōei-zan peak on the south side of the mountain, in addition to several other locations, depending on wind direction. Several paragliding schools use the wide sandy/grassy slope between Gotemba and Subashiri parking lots as a training hill.

== In popular culture ==
As a national symbol of the country, the mountain has been depicted in various art media such as painting, woodblock prints (such as the ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]''), poetry, music, theatre, film, [[manga]], [[anime]], [[Japanese pottery]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunritz-hattori-museum.or.jp/masterpieces/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[kawaii]] subculture.

'''Nicolay de Caveri''' (14??-15??) was a map-maker from [[Genoa]], [[Italy]]. He has also been known as Nicolay Canerio, Nicolo Caveri, Nicolo Canerio, Nicolaus de Caveri, Nicolaus de Caverio, Nicholas de Caveri, and Nicolai de Caveri, all based upon variant readings of his signature on the back of his famous manuscript map.

[[Caverio map|His map]] of 1503 or 1504 was the primary source map used to draw the Western hemisphere on the [[Waldseemüller map]] in 1507.

The '''Saidu Sharif Stupa''', excavated under the name '''Saidu Sharif I''', is a sacred area of [[Buddhism | Buddhist]] located near the city of [[Saidu Sharif]], at the foot of the mountains that separate the river valley [[Saidu]] from that of the river [[Jambil]], in the [[Swat District]] of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]. The sacred area consists of two terraces built on the slope of the hill, through a cut in the rock on the north side. Artificial terracing includes one [[stūpa]], surrounded by smaller monuments, and a monastery.&lt;ref name=BA&gt;Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, Grafikol 2009, p.174-176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
The excavations were initiated by the Italian Archaeological Mission in 1963 and ended in 1982, with a pause between 1966 and 1977. The first excavation campaign investigated the lower terrace with the main [[stūpa]], while the upper terrace with the monastery it was brought to light during the second campaign.&lt;ref name=BA/&gt;

The lower terrace (called "Terrace of the Stupas") has a larger [[stūpa]] (Main Stupa) surrounded by other minor monuments: [[stūpa]]s, [[vihara]]s and columns. Of the Main Stupa is preserved the structure with a square plan up to the first cylindrical body, with a stairway on the north side; of the ''harmikā'' and of the umbrellas are preserved some remains found near the stūpa. One of the two cylindrical bodies of the monument was adorned with a frieze figured in green schist while at the four corners of the top of the rectangular body were four columns on a pedestal with a lion figure crouched on top.&lt;ref name=BA/&gt;

The life phase of the sanctuary of Saidu Sharif I was divided by archaeologists in three periods, during which time we pass from a symmetrical arrangement of the monuments (first period, between 25 BCE and the end of the 1st century) to a progressive crowding of the Terrace of the Stupa, followed by an extension of the terrace itself (second and third periods, respectively II-III century CE and IV-V century CE). The three construction periods were also highlighted on the upper terrace; the monastery underwent an extension followed by a reduction to the original dimensions in the third period, which testifies to the decline of the entire sacred area.&lt;ref name=BA/&gt;

The '''Samseonghyeol''' ([[Korean language|Korean]] for “three clans' holes”) are three large holes in the ground in [[Jeju, Jeju|Jeju]] on [[Jeju-do|Jejudo]], an island in the northern [[East China Sea]]. The holes are in the city's urban area on the central north coast.

{{main article|Samseong mythology}}

According to legend, here three demigods emerged from the ground to become the founding fathers of [[Tamna]] and its people, whose
descendants bear their family names:
* Go Eulna ({{lang|ko-Hang|고을나}} = {{lang|ko-Hant|高乙那}})
* Ryang Eulna ({{lang|ko-Hang|량을나}} = {{lang|ko-Hant|良乙那}})
* Bu Eulna ({{lang|ko-Hang|부을나}} = {{lang|ko-Hant|夫乙那}})

According to an animated film shown at a local shrine, a mysterious man later arrived by ship bringing three beautiful princesses who became their wives, taught them agriculture, and helped them to develop and populate the island. Eventually the three men shot three arrows from the top of a mountain which landed in three places on the island, signifying the places of residence for their descendants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2469">The '''Society of Woman Geographers''' was established in 1925 at a time when women were excluded from membership in most professional organizations, such as the [[Explorers Club]], who would not admit women until 1981.&lt;ref name="ware"&gt;Ware. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized by four friends [[Gertrude Emerson Sen]], [[Marguerite Harrison]], [[Blair Niles]] and  [[Gertrude Mathews Shelby]], to bring together women interested in geography, world exploration, anthropology and related fields.

Among its founders were [[Harriet Chalmers Adams]], the society's first president in December 1925, a post which she held until 1933. &lt;ref name="anema"&gt;Anema. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the society presented its first medal to [[Amelia Earhart]]. Famous members included: historian [[Mary Ritter Beard]], photographer [[Margaret Bourke-White]], novelist [[Fannie Hurst]],  mountain climber [[Annie Smith Peck]], anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and author [[Grace Gallatin Seton Thompson]]. [[Margaret Mead]] was presented with the society's Gold Medal in 1942.&lt;ref name="ware"/&gt;

'''The Guianas''', sometimes called by the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] loan-word '''''Guayanas''''' (''Las Guayanas''), are a region in north-eastern [[South America]] which includes the following three territories:
* [[French Guiana]], an [[Overseas department and region|overseas department]] of [[France]]

* [[Suriname]], formerly [[Dutch colonization of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]], until 1814 together with Berbice, Essequibo and Demerara.

==History==
[[File:Guaiana ofte de Provincien tusschen Rio de las Amazonas ende Rio de Yuiapari ofte Orinoque.jpg|thumb|Parime Lacus on a map by [[Hessel Gerritsz]] (1625). Situated at the west coast of the lake, the so-called city Manoa or El Dorado]]
[[File:Kaart van Guiana - Engelsch, Nederlandsch en Fransch (1888).jpg|thumb|Map of the Guianas dated 1888.]]
===Pre-Columbian===
Before the arrival of European explorers, the Guianas were populated by scattered bands of [[Arawak]] Indians. The native [[tribe]]s of the Northern [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] are most closely related to the natives of the [[Caribbean]]; most evidence suggests that the Arawaks immigrated from the [[Orinoco]] and [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]] [[River Basin]] in Venezuela and Guiana into the northern islands, and were then supplanted by more warlike tribes of [[Island Caribs|Carib]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; [[Indigenous Americans|Indians]], who departed from these same [[river valley]]s a few centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Rogoziński, ''A Brief History of the Caribbean, from the Arawak and Carib to the Present'' (New York: Facts on File, Inc., 1999); Paul Radin, ''Indians of South America'' (New York: Greenwood Press Publishers, 1942); and J. H. Parry, ''The Discovery of South America'' (New York: Taplinger Publishing Company, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries of the [[pre-Columbian era]], the ebb and flow of power between Arawak and Carib interests throughout the Caribbean resulted in a great deal of intermingling (some forced through capture, some accidental through contact). This ethnic mixing, particularly in the Caribbean margins like the Guianas, produced a hybridized culture. Despite their political rivalry, the ethnic and cultural blending between the two groups had reached such a level that, by the time of the Europeans' arrival, the Carib/Arawak complex in Guiana was so homogenous that the two groups were almost indistinguishable to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Radin, pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the contact period following Columbus's arrival, the term "Guiana" was used to refer to all areas between the Orinoco, the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], and the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], and was seen so much as a unified, isolated entity that it was often referred to as the “Island of Guiana.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Harcourt (explorer)|Robert Harcourt]], ''A Relation of a Voyage to Guiana'' (1613; repr., London Hakluyt Society Press, 1928), p. 4; Joshua Hyles, ''Guiana and the Shadows of Empire'', Baylor University, 2010, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European colonization===
[[Christopher Columbus]] first spotted the coast of the Guianas in 1498, but real interest in the exploration and colonization of the Guianas, which came to be known as the "Wild Coast," did not begin until the end of the sixteenth century. [[Walter Raleigh]] began the exploration of the Guianas in earnest in 1594. He was in search of a great golden city at the headwaters of the [[Caroní River]]. A year later [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|he explored]] what is now [[Guyana]] and [[Guayana Region|eastern Venezuela]] in search of "Manoa", the legendary city of the king known as [[El Dorado]]. Raleigh described the city of El Dorado as being located on [[Lake Parime]] far up the [[Orinoco River]] in Guyana. Much of his exploration is documented in his books [[The Discovery of Guiana|''The Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana'']], published first in 1596, and ''The Discovery of Guiana, and the Journal of the Second Voyage Thereto'', published in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Walter Raleigh, ''The Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and Bewtiful Empyre of Guiana'' (1596; repr., Amsterdam: Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1968) and ''The Discovery of Guiana, and the Journal of the Second Voyage Thereto'' (1606; repr., London: Cassell, 1887).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of Raleigh's accounts, several other [[Europe]]an powers developed interest in the Guianas. The Dutch joined in the exploration of the Guianas before the end of the century. In the 80 years between the start of the [[Dutch Revolt]] in 1568 and 1648, when the [[Peace of Münster|Treaty of Münster]] was signed with the Spanish, the Dutch had been practising the delicate art of cobbling together different ethnicities and religious faiths into a viable economic entity. When beginning an empire, the Dutch concerned themselves more with trade and establishing viable networks and outposts than with claiming tracts of land to act as a buffer against neighbouring states. With this goal in mind, the Dutch dispatched explorer [[Jacob Cornelisz]] to survey the area in 1597. His clerk, Adriaen Cabeliau, related the voyage of Cornelisz and his survey of Indian groups and areas of potential trade partnerships in his diary. Throughout the seventeenth century, the Dutch made gains by establishing trading colonies and outposts in the region and in the neighboring Caribbean islands under the banner of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. The company, established in 1621 for such purposes, benefited from a larger investment of capital than the English, primarily through foreign investors like [[Isaac de Pinto]], a Portuguese Jew.  The area was also cursorily explored by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Vasco Nuñez de Balboa]], and in 1608 the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] also organized an expedition to the Guianas, but this was cut short by the untimely death of the Grand Duke.

English and Dutch settlers were regularly harassed by the Spanish and Portuguese, who viewed settlement of the area as a violation of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. In 1613, Dutch trading posts on the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]] and [[Courantyne River|Corantijn]] Rivers were completely destroyed by Spanish troops. The troops had been sent into the Guianas from neighboring Venezuela under the premise of stamping out [[privateering]] and with the support of a cédula passed by the Spanish [[Council of the Indies]] and [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III]].&lt;ref&gt;Goslinga, Cornelis. The Dutch in the Caribbean and on the Wild Coast. Gainesville, FL: University of Florida Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Dutch returned in 1615, founding a new settlement at present-day [[Cayenne]] (later abandoned in favor of [[Suriname]]), one on the [[Oyapock River|Wiapoco River]] (now more commonly known as the Oyapock) and one on the upper Amazon. By 1621, a charter was granted by the [[States-General of the Netherlands|Dutch States-General]], but even a few years prior to the official chartering a fort and trading post had been built at Kijkoveral, under the supervision of Aert Groenewegen, at the confluence of the Essequibo, [[Cuyuni River|Cuyuni]], and [[Mazaruni River]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Raymond T. ''British Guiana''. London: Oxford University Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; British settlers also succeeded in establishing a small settlement in 1606 and a much larger one in modern-day [[Suriname]] in 1650, under the leadership of former Barbadian governor Francis [[Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Willoughby, Lord Parham]].&lt;ref&gt;Goslinga, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French had also made less significant attempts at [[French colonization of the Americas|colonization]], first in 1604 along the [[Sinnamary River]]. The settlement collapsed within a summer, and initial attempts at settlement near modern-day [[Cayenne, French Guiana|Cayenne]], beginning in 1613, were met with similar setbacks. French priorities — land acquisition and [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] conversion — were not easily reconciled with the difficulties of initial settlement-building on the Wild Coast. Even as late as 1635, the [[King of France]] granted permission to the whole of Guiana to a joint-stock company of Norman merchants. When these merchants made a settlement near the modern city of Cayenne, failure ensued. Eight years later, a reinforcement contingent led by [[Charles Poncet de Brétigny]] found only a few of the original colonists left alive, living among the aborigines. Later that year, among the combined total of the original surviving settlers, the reinforcement contingent led by de Brétigny, and a subsequent reinforcement later in the year, only two individuals remained alive long enough to reach the Dutch settlement on the [[Pomeroon River]] in 1645, begging for refuge. Though some trading outposts that could be considered permanent settlements were founded as early as 1624, French “possession” of the land now known as [[French Guiana]] is not recognized as having taken place until at least 1637. Cayenne itself, the first permanent settlement of comparable size to the Dutch colonies, experienced instability until 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thayer |last=Watkins|title= Political and Economic History of French Guiana|work= San Jose State University Faculty Research|url= http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/fguiana.htm |accessdate= November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, ''Greater France: a History of French Overseas Expansion'', New York, St. Martin’s Press, 1996; Hyles, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch appointed a new [[commandeur]] of the Guiana settlements in 1742. In this year, Laurens Storm van 's Gravesande took over the region. He held the position for three decades, coordinating the development and expansion of the Dutch colonies from his Netherlands home in [[Soestdijk]]. Gravesande’s tenure brought significant change to the colonies, though his policy was in many ways an extension of his predecessor, Hermanus Gelskerke. Commandeur Gelskerke had begun pressing for change from a trading focus to one of cultivation, especially of [[sugar]]. The area east of the existing Essequibo colony, known as [[Demerara]], was relatively isolated and encompassed the trading areas of just a few indigenous tribes, thus it contained only two trading outposts during Gelskerke’s term of office. Demerara, though, showed great potential as a sugar-cultivating area, so the commandeur began shifting focus toward the development of the region, signifying his intentions by transferring the administrative center of the colony from Fort Kijkoveral to Flag Island, on the mouth of the Essequibo River, further east and closer to Demerara. These operations were carried out by Gravesande, acting as the Secretary of the Company under Gelskerke. Upon Gelskerke’s death, Gravesande continued the policy of Demerara expansion and the move to sugar cultivation.

Conflict among the British, Dutch, and French continued throughout the seventeenth century. The [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] sealed peace between the English and the Dutch. The treaty allowed the Dutch to retain control over the valuable sugar plantations and factories on the coast of [[Suriname (Dutch colony)|Suriname]] which had been secured by [[Abraham Crijnssen]] earlier in 1667.

All the colonies along the Guiana coast were converted to profitable [[sugar plantation]]s during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. War continued off and on among the three principal powers in the Guianas (the Netherlands, France, and Britain) until a final peace was signed in 1814 (the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Convention of London]]), heavily favouring the British. By this time France had sold off most of its North American territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and had lost all but [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], and [[French Guiana]] in the Caribbean region. The Dutch lost [[Berbice]], Essequibo, and Demerara; these colonies were consolidated under a central British administration and would be known after 1831 as [[British Guiana]]. The Dutch retained Suriname.

After 1814, the Guianas came to be recognized individually as [[British Guiana]], [[French Guiana]], and [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch Guiana]].

'''Trevor John Barnes''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 14 July 1956, [[London]], England) is a British geographer and Professor of [[Economic geography]] at the [[University of British Columbia]].

==Background==
Trevor Barnes received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1983 at [[University of Minnesota]] with a thesis under the supervision of [[Eric Sheppard]] titled ''The Geography of Value, Production, and Distribution: Theoretical Economic Geography after [[Piero Sraffa|Sraffa]]''. Barnes began his career as a [[spatial science|spatial scientist]], but in recent years his interest has moved to the history of economic geography. His current projects concern the history of geography's [[quantitative geography|quantitative revolution]]; [[epistemological pluralism]] in economic geography; the institutional analysis of forestry with [[Roger Hayter]]; and [[creative industry|creative industries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geog.ubc.ca/~tbarnes/ Trevor J.

In [[physical geography]], '''tundra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|n|d|r|ə|,_|ˈ|t|ʊ|n|-}}) is a type of [[biome]] where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term ''tundra'' comes through [[Russian language|Russian]] {{lang|ru|тундра}} (''{{lang|ru-Latn|tûndra}}'') from the [[Kildin Sami language|Kildin Sami]] word {{lang|sjd|тӯндар}} (''{{lang|sjd-Latn|tūndâr}}'') meaning "uplands", "treeless mountain tract".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tunturista jängälle |work=Kieli-ikkunat

Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The [[ecotone]] (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the [[tree line]] or timberline.

There are three regions and associated types of tundra: Arctic tundra,&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt; [[alpine tundra]],&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tundra Biome |work=The World's Biomes |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss5/biome/tundra.html |accessdate=2006-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antarctic tundra]].&lt;ref name="wwf"&gt;{{cite web |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions: Antarctica |work=Wild World |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial_an.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62am1PNdU?url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial_an.html |archivedate=2011-10-21 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=2009-11-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{anchor|Arctic tundra}}
Arctic tundra occurs in the far [[Northern Hemisphere]], north of the [[taiga]] belt. The word "tundra" usually refers only to the areas where the subsoil is [[permafrost]], or permanently frozen soil. (It may also refer to the treeless plain in general, so that northern [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]] would be included.) Permafrost tundra includes vast areas of northern Russia and Canada.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt; The polar tundra is home to several peoples who are mostly nomadic reindeer herders, such as the [[Nganasan people|Nganasan]] and [[Nenet people|Nenets]] in the permafrost area (and the [[Sami people|Sami]] in [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]]).
[[File:Tundra in Siberia.jpg|thumb|Tundra in [[Siberia]]]]

Arctic tundra contains areas of stark landscape and is frozen for much of the year. The soil there is frozen from {{convert|25|to|90|cm|0|abbr=on}} down, making it impossible for trees to grow. Instead, bare and sometimes rocky land can only support certain kinds of [[Arctic vegetation]], low growing plants such as moss, heath ([[Ericaceae]] varieties such as [[crowberry]] and [[Arctostaphylos alpina|black bearberry]]), and [[lichen]]. 

There are two main seasons, winter and summer, in the polar tundra areas. During the winter it is very cold and dark, with the average temperature around {{convert|-28|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, sometimes dipping as low as {{convert|-50|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. However, extreme cold temperatures on the tundra do not drop as low as those experienced in taiga areas further south (for example, Russia's and Canada's lowest temperatures were recorded in locations south of the tree line). During the summer, temperatures rise somewhat, and the top layer of seasonally-frozen soil melts, leaving the ground very soggy. The tundra is covered in marshes, lakes, bogs and streams during the warm months. Generally daytime temperatures during the summer rise to about {{convert|12|°C|°F|abbr=on}} but can often drop to {{convert|3|°C|°F|abbr=on}} or even below freezing. Arctic tundras are sometimes the subject of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] [[conservation movement|conservation]] programs. In Canada and Russia, many of these areas are protected through a national [[Biodiversity Action Plan]].

[[File:Vontut National Park.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vuntut National Park]] in Canada]]
Tundra tends to be windy, with winds often blowing upwards of {{convert|50|-|100|kph|mph|-1|abbr=on}}. However, in terms of precipitation, it is desert-like, with only about {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} falling per year (the summer is typically the season of maximum precipitation). Although precipitation is light, evaporation is also relatively minimal. During the summer, the permafrost thaws just enough to let plants grow and reproduce, but because the ground below this is frozen, the water cannot sink any lower, and so the water forms the lakes and marshes found during the summer months. There is a natural pattern of accumulation of fuel and wildfire which varies depending on the nature of vegetation and terrain. Research in Alaska has shown fire-event return intervals (FRIs) that typically vary from 150 to 200 years, with dryer lowland areas burning more frequently than wetter highland areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author2=Melissa L. Chipman|author3=Jennifer L. Barnes|author4=Michael A.

[[File:Muskox and Geese.jpg|thumb|A group of [[muskox]]en in Alaska]]

The [[biodiversity]] of tundra is low: 1,700 species of vascular plants and only 48 species of land mammals can be found, although millions of birds migrate there each year for the marshes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibacanada.com/site.jsp?siteID=NU078&amp;seedet=N |title=Great Plain of the Koukdjuak |publisher=Ibacanada.com |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a few fish species. There are few species with large populations. Notable animals in the Arctic tundra include [[reindeer]] (caribou), [[musk ox]], [[Arctic hare]], [[Arctic fox]], [[snowy owl]], [[lemming]]s, and even [[polar bear]]s near the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tundra |work=Blue Planet Biomes |url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/tundra.htm |accessdate=2006-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tundra is largely devoid of [[poikilotherm]]s such as frogs or lizards.

Due to the harsh climate of Arctic tundra, regions of this kind have seen little human activity, even though they are sometimes rich in natural resources such as [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]] and [[uranium]]. In recent times this has begun to change in [[Alaska]], Russia, and some other parts of the world: for example, the [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] produces 90% of Russia's natural gas.

===Relationship with global warming===
A severe threat to tundra is [[global warming]], which causes [[permafrost]] to melt. The melting of the permafrost in a given area on human time scales (decades or centuries) could radically change which species can survive there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tundra Threats |work=National Geographic |url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/tundra-threats.html |accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern is that about one third of the world's soil-bound carbon is in [[taiga]] and tundra areas.

Antarctic tundra occurs on Antarctica and on several Antarctic and subantarctic islands, including [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] and the [[Kerguelen Islands]]. Most of Antarctica is too cold and dry to support vegetation, and most of the continent is covered by ice fields. However, some portions of the continent, particularly the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], have areas of rocky soil that support plant life. The flora presently consists of around 300–400 lichens, 100 mosses, 25 [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], and around 700 terrestrial and aquatic algae species, which live on the areas of exposed rock and soil around the shore of the continent. Antarctica's two flowering plant species, the [[Antarctic hair grass]] (''Deschampsia antarctica'') and [[Antarctic pearlwort]] (''Colobanthus quitensis''), are found on the northern and western parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Terrestrial Plants |work=British Antarctic Survey: About Antarctica |url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/ |accessdate=2006-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast with the Arctic tundra, the Antarctic tundra lacks a large mammal fauna, mostly due to its physical isolation from the other continents. Sea mammals and sea birds, including seals and penguins, inhabit areas near the shore, and some small mammals, like rabbits and cats, have been introduced by humans to some of the subantarctic islands. The [[Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra]] [[ecoregion]] includes the [[Bounty Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], [[Antipodes Islands]], the [[Campbell Island group]], and [[Macquarie Island]].&lt;ref name="wwf2"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1101|name=Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Species endemic to this ecoregion include ''[[Nematoceras dienemum]]'' and ''[[Nematoceras sulcatum]]'', the only subantarctic orchids; the [[royal penguin]]; and the [[Antipodean albatross]].&lt;ref name="wwf2"/&gt;

There is some ambiguity on whether [[Magellanic moorland]], on the west coast of [[Patagonia]], should be considered tundra or not.&lt;ref name=Longton1988&gt;{{cite book |last=Longton |first=R.E. |date=1988 |title=Biology of Polar Bryophytes and Lichen |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=20 |isbn=0-521-25015-3 |author-link=|series=Studies in Polar Research }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[phytogeography|Phytogeographer]] [[Edmundo Pisano]] called it tundra ({{lang-es|tundra Magallánica}}) since he considered the low temperatures key to restrict plant growth.&lt;ref name=Longton1988/&gt;

The flora and fauna of Antarctica and the Antarctic Islands (south of 60° south latitude) are protected by the [[Antarctic Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty |work=British Antarctic Survey: About Antarctica |url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/geopolitical/treaty/ |accessdate=2006-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Alpine tundra}}
[[File:Valle de Mifafí 3.jpg|thumb|Alpine tundra at [[Venezuelan Andes]]]]
Alpine tundra does not contain trees because the climate and soils at high altitude block tree growth. Alpine tundra is distinguished from arctic tundra in that alpine tundra typically does not have permafrost, and alpine soils are generally better drained than arctic soils. Alpine tundra transitions to subalpine forests below the tree line; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra [[ecotone]] (the [[treeline]]) are known as ''[[Krummholz]]''.

Alpine tundra occurs in mountains worldwide. The flora of the alpine tundra is characterized by dwarf shrubs close to the ground. The cold climate of the alpine tundra is caused by the low air temperatures, and is similar to [[polar climate]].

== Climatic classification ==
{{see also|Polar climate|Alpine climate}}
[[File:Kongsfjorden from Blomstrandhalvoja.jpg|thumb|right|Tundra region with fjords, glaciers and mountains. Kongsfjorden, [[Spitsbergen]].]]
Tundra climates ordinarily fit the [[Köppen climate classification]] ''ET'', signifying a local climate in which at least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow ({{convert|0|C}}), but no month with an average temperature in excess of {{convert|10|C}}. The cold limit generally meets the ''EF'' climates of [[ice cap|permanent ice and snow]]s; the warm-summer limit generally corresponds with the poleward or altitudinal limit of trees, where they grade into the [[subarctic climate]]s designated ''Dfd'', ''Dwd'' and ''Dsd'' (extreme winters as in parts of [[Siberia]]), ''Dfc'' typical in Alaska, Canada, parts of [[Scandinavia]], [[European Russia]], and [[West Siberian Plain|Western Siberia]] (cold winters with months of freezing), or even ''Cfc'' (no month colder than {{convert|-3|C}} as in parts of [[Iceland]] and southernmost South America). Tundra climates as a rule are hostile to woody vegetation even where the winters are comparatively mild by polar standards, as in Iceland.

Despite the potential diversity of climates in the ''ET'' category involving precipitation, extreme temperatures, and relative wet and dry seasons, this category is rarely subdivided. Rainfall and snowfall are generally slight due to the low [[vapor pressure]] of water in the chilly atmosphere, but as a rule [[potential evapotranspiration]] is extremely low, allowing soggy terrain of swamps and bogs even in places that get precipitation typical of deserts of lower and middle latitudes. The amount of native tundra biomass depends more on the local temperature than the amount of precipitation.
