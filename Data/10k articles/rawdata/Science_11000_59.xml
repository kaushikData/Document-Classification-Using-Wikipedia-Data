==History==
The AFRC was formed in 1983 from its predecessor, the '''Agricultural Research Council''' ('''ARC'''). It was replaced by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC) as a result of government reorganisation in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council |url=http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/links/pages/bbsrc.aspx |publisher=BBSRC |accessdate=18 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023004435/http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/links/Pages/BBSRC.aspx |archivedate=23 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time Sir William Henderson who was secretary to the AFRC claimed that "agriculture was a success story" hence the AFRC could be closed and a new vision for research was envisaged in the creation of the BBSRC. With this shift in emphasis, there also followed the closure of several educational and research organisations as for example the internationally renowned [[Wye College]].

'''Aleksandr Fyodorovich Poleshchuk''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Фёдорович Полещук}}, born October 30, 1953) is a Russian [[cosmonaut]].

Born in [[Cheremkhovo]], [[Irkutsk region]], he graduated from the [[Moscow Aviation Institute]] in 1977 with a mechanical engineering diploma. He then joined [[RSC Energia]] as a test engineer, where he was occupied with perfecting repair and assembly techniques performed during space flights. He has extensive experience in test work under simulated weightlessness conditions. In February 1989 he was selected as a test cosmonaut candidate (1989 Cosmonaut Candidates Class, Group 14, Civil Specialists). From September 1989 to January 1991 he underwent the complete course of general space training and was qualified as a test cosmonaut, and then till March 1992 he undertook advanced training for the Soyuz-TM transport vehicle and [[Mir]] station flight.

In 1992 he was selected as the backup flight engineer of the [[Soyuz TM-15]] joint Russian-French mission, and consequently nominated as the flight engineer of the prime crew of [[Soyuz TM-16]]. In space from January 24 to July 22, 1993, he participated in a 179-day space flight with [[Gennady Manakov]]. During the flight he performed two [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]s totaling 9 hours and 58 minutes. Also testing of the androgynous peripheral docking subassembly of the Kristall module was performed.

October 1994 to March 1995 he trained as back-up flight engineer for the [[Soyuz TM-21]] transport vehicle and Mir Station 18th primary expedition flights.

Poleshchuk is married and has one daughter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5833">'''Cello scrotum''' is a [[hoax]] medical condition originally published as a brief [[case report]] in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref name="BMJ, Murphy, 1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Peer reveals 'cello scrotum' hoax |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7853564.stm |quote=A top doctor has admitted her part in hoodwinking a leading [[medical journal]] after inventing a medical condition called 'cello scrotum'. |department=Health|publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='Cello scrotum' exposed as a hoax |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/28/uk.cello.scrotum.hoax/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |quote=A medical ailment that has worried male members of string sections across the music world for over 30 years has been exposed as a hoax. |work=[[CNN]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name suggests, it was purportedly an affliction of the [[scrotum]] affecting male players of the [[cello]].

==History==

The original letter&lt;ref name="BMJ, Murphy, 1974" &gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The BMJ]]|last=Murphy |first=John M. |authorlink=John Murphy (branding consultant)|title=Letter: Cello scrotum|date=11 May 1974|volume=2|issue=5914|page=335|pmid=4827125|pmc=1610985|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5914.335-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written by Dr [[Elaine Murphy, Baroness Murphy|Elaine Murphy]] but signed by her husband [[John Murphy (branding consultant)|John]] as a joke to compare with a previous letter regarding 'guitar nipple',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curtis | first=P. |title=Letter: Guitar nipple |journal=[[The BMJ]]|volume=2 |issue=5912 |pages=226 |date=27 April 1974 |pmid=4857619 |pmc=1610876 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.5912.226-a|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition reportedly occurring when some styles of [[guitar]] playing excessively irritate the player's [[nipple]] (a form of [[Contact dermatitis#Physical irritant contact dermatitis|contact dermatitis]] similar to [[jogger's nipple]]), which Murphy and her husband believed was likely a joke.

Murphy now points out that even a cursory study of the cellist's [[Cello#Body position|posture]] would show that the 'cello scrotum' complaint would not occur. The unlikelihood of a cellist's posture contributing to scrotal injury was raised back in 1974, but seems to have been overlooked.&lt;ref name="BMJ, Scheuer, 1974" &gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[The BMJ]]|last=Scheuer |first=P.

'''''A Civic Biology: Presented in Problems''''' (usually referred to as just '''''Civic Biology''''') was a [[biology]] [[textbook]] written by [[George William Hunter]], published in 1914. It is the book which the state of [[Tennessee]] required high school teachers to use in 1925 and is best known for its section about [[evolution]] that was ruled by a local court to be in violation of the state [[Butler Act]].  It was for teaching from this textbook that [[John T. Scopes]] was brought to trial in [[Dayton, Tennessee]] in the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes "Monkey" Trial]]. The views espoused in the book about evolution, race, and [[eugenics]] were common to American [[Progressives]] (especially in the work of [[Charles Benedict Davenport]], one of the most prominent American biologists of the early 20th century, whom Hunter cites in the book).

==Excerpts==

Excerpts from the book give its general tone and approach to controversial topics regarding mankind:

{{quote|Evolution of Man. – Undoubtedly there once lived upon the earth races of men who were much lower in their mental organization than the present inhabitants. If we follow the early history of man upon the earth, we find that at first he must have been little better than one of the lower animals. He was a nomad, wandering from place to place, feeding upon whatever living things he could kill with his hands. Gradually he must have learned to use weapons, and thus kill his prey, first using rough stone implements for this purpose. As man became more civilized, implements of bronze and of iron were used. About this time the subjugation and domestication of animals began to take place. Man then began to cultivate the fields, and to have a fixed place of abode other than a cave. The beginnings of civilization were long ago, but even to-day the earth is not entirely civilized.

The Races of Man. – At the present time there exist upon the earth five races or varieties of man, each very different from the other in instincts, social customs, and, to an extent, in structure. These are the Ethiopian or negro type, originating in Africa; the Malay or brown race, from the islands of the Pacific; The American Indian; the Mongolian or yellow race, including the natives of China, Japan, and the Eskimos; and finally, the highest type of all, the caucasians, represented by the civilized white inhabitants of Europe and America. ...

Improvement of Man. – If the stock of domesticated animals can be improved, it is not unfair to ask if the health and vigor of the future generations of men and women on the earth might not be improved by applying to them the laws of selection. This improvement of the future race has a number of factors in which we as individuals may play a part. These are personal hygiene, selection of healthy mates, and the betterment of the environment.

Eugenics. – When people marry there are certain things that the individual as well as the race should demand. The most important of these is freedom from germ diseases which might be handed down to the offspring. Tuberculosis, syphilis, that dread disease which cripples and kills hundreds of thousands of innocent children, epilepsy, and feeble-mindedness are handicaps which it is not only unfair but criminal to hand down to posterity. The science of being well born is called eugenics. ...

Parasitism and its Cost to Society. – Hundreds of families such as those described above exist today, spreading disease, immorality, and crime to all parts of this country. The cost to society of such families is very severe. Just as certain animals or plants become parasitic on other plants or animals, these families have become parasitic on society. They not only do harm to others by corrupting, stealing, or spreading disease, but they are actually protected and cared for by the state out of public money. Largely for them the poorhouse and the asylum exist. They take from society, but they give nothing in return. They are true parasites.

The Remedy. – If such people were lower animals, we would probably kill them off to prevent them from spreading. Humanity will not allow this, but we do have the remedy of separating the sexes in asylums or other places and in various ways preventing intermarriage and the possibilities of perpetuating such a low and degenerate race. Remedies of this sort have been tried successfully in Europe and are now meeting with some success in this country.}}

==Development and publication==
Hunter was born in Mamaroneck New York, and was educated at [[Williams College]], the [[University of Chicago]], and [[New York University]], where he obtained his doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;"Magat, Richard. 'The Forgotten Roles of Two New York City Teachers in the Epic Scopes Trial.' Science &amp; Society 70, No. 4 (2006): 542."&lt;/ref&gt;  He later became chairman of the biology department at his alma mater, De Witt Clinton High School, a public secondary school for boys in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Pauly, Philip J. "The Development of High School Biology: New York City, 1900-1925." Isis 82, No. 4 (1991): 662.&lt;/ref&gt;  During his time at Clinton, he wrote or co-authored 30 textbooks for college and high school biology courses, including ''Civic Biology'' in 1905. By working with educators at Columbia University's Teachers College and the geneticist, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], Hunter developed ''Civic Biology'', a textbook that shaped the modern secondary-school biology curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Pauly (1925).pp.662.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eugenics==
	In the first edition of ''Civic Biology'', Hunter briefly discusses [[eugenics]] on one page of the 432 page textbook. Along with many other evolutionary biologists, Hunter embraced the idea of [[eugenics]] as a social doctrine. It was a popular idea in the early 20th century, and several states had enacted laws to compel the sexual segregation and sterilization of people deemed eugenically unfit.&lt;ref&gt;Magat.(2006): 541.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter believed that society could perfect the human race by preventing intermarriage between people such as the mentally ill, criminals, and epileptics.&lt;ref&gt;Magat. (2006). 539.&lt;/ref&gt; Hunter also believed that the Caucasian race was the highest type of all the races.&lt;ref&gt;Magat. (2006). 539.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shifts in science education==
	[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] had published his evolutionary theories 60 years before the public controversy over ''Civic Biology'' with the [[Scopes Trial]]. Prior to the Scopes Trial and controversy over ''Civic Biology'', most science textbooks included Darwinian concepts in order to keep abreast with prevalent scientific ideas.  In the early 20th century, there was a movement in the education sector to bring evolution into high school classrooms, in order to update and reshape how biology was taught. Once evolution began being taught in high schools, controversy over Darwin's theories developed.&lt;ref&gt;"Shapiro, Adam R. 'Civic Biology and the Origin of the School Antievolution Movement.' Journal of the History of Biology 41, No. 3 (2008): 430."&lt;/ref&gt;  These efforts tried to incorporate progressive educational ideologies and apply the biological sciences to human society.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro. (2008). 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Civic Biology'' was an example of the new approaches to scientific instruction emerging in the education sector.&lt;ref&gt;Ladouceur(2008).435.&lt;/ref&gt; This modern education focused on applying scientific principles to human society by developing applicable and relevant content for students.&lt;ref&gt;Moore pp.542.&lt;/ref&gt; This movement towards socially applicable biology was coupled with national efforts towards mandatory public education. Anti-evolution efforts and legislation were responding to the redesigned ideologies in the new biology curricula, and also to the  centralized control and regulation of education.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro. (2008). 428.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about public and standardized education were part of the public debate over ''Civic Biology.''&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro(2008).428.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural context==
	There were a variety of socio-cultural events that shaped the publication and reaction to ''Civic Biology.'' Following World War I, a cultural movement emerged that poised two ideological groups against each other: the traditionalists and the modernists.&lt;ref&gt;Hellmann, Robert A. "Evolution in American School Biology Books from the Late Nineteenth Century until the 1930's." The American Biology Teacher 27, no. 10 (1965): 778-80. doi:10.2307/4441184.&lt;/ref&gt; The modernists embraced intellectual experimentation by exploring new philosophies such as Freudian theories and advocated against alcohol prohibition in political spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Hellman (1965) pp. 779.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this modernist cultural movement, there was a religious revivalist movement to protest the emergence of these progressive ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Hellman (1965).pp.779.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditionalists were distinguished by their religious zeal. This group favored alcohol prohibition laws and a literal interpretation of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Hellman (1965).pp.780.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scopes Trial==
	The prosecution made arguments that fit the ideology of the traditionalists. The contents of ''Civic Biology'' were not specifically discussed in the trial, but rather the trial focused on the merits and problems with Darwin's theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Oscar W. "The Present Status of Biology in the Secondary Schools." The School Review 31, no. 2 (1923): 143-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scopes Trial used ''Civic Biology'' as a tool to have a publicized and public debate on whether or not evolution should continue to be taught. 
	Specifically, the prosecution argued that teaching evolution undermined traditional religious values by disrupting the Biblical concept of a six day creation.&lt;ref&gt;Richards(1923).143.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, prosecutors proposed that Darwinian concepts could subvert the political sphere of the United States. They argued that the concept of "survival of the fittest" could be used to justify a laissez-faire capitalist system, imperialism, and militarism in United States politics.&lt;ref&gt;Richards(1923).143.&lt;/ref&gt; They also warned that Darwin's theories could be used to justify mass sterilization of livestock in order to selectively breed the best organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Richards(1923).143.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scopes Trial prosecution created agreements to demonstrate the dangers that teaching evolutionary theory could pose to society. 
	The defendants crafted arguments that largely fit within a modernist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, John W. "TEACHING EVOLUTION." Journal of College Science Teaching 4, no. 4 (1975): 277.&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that evolution should be taught to high school students under the protection of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;Magat pp.541.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants proposed a more liberal and innovative science curriculum be provided to students, one that kept up with popular scientific ideas of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Magat pp.541.&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that it was within the rights of teachers and students to decide whether or not to use ''Civic Biology''.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 277.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants also generally advocated for a public education system that was independent of specific political, economic, and religious viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;Moore pp.542.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
	The [[Scopes Trial]] and the controversy over ''Civic Biology'' was a major setback for anti-evolution groups because of the 15 states with anti-evolution legislation pending in 1925, only 2 enacted laws restricting the teaching of Darwin's evolutionary theories.&lt;ref&gt;Magat (2006): 549.&lt;/ref&gt;  While this public controversy had some political implications, it was not extensively influential in the education sector and the instruction of the biological sciences. During the 1970s, it was believed that pressure from Christian fundamentalists after the [[Scopes Trial]] forced textbook authors to limit the discussion of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Ladouceur, Ronald P. 'Ella Thea Smith and the Lost History of American High School Biology Textbooks.' Journal of the History of Biology 41, No. 3 (2008): 435."&lt;/ref&gt;  However, upon later examination of biology textbooks, scholars determined that textbook authors worked to develop biological curricula that differentiated and defended its content, in an attempt to reduce the influence of religious fundamentalism on the biological sciences. As a result, modern scholars now believe that overall, biology textbooks were not heavily influenced by anti-evolution rhetoric after the [[Scopes Trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Ladouceur.(2008). 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

	While biology textbooks did not yield heavy influence from the Scopes Trial, some laws emerged that affected high school teachers. After the Scopes Trial, many teachers, particularly in the South, were then required to take oaths of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Ladouceur, Ronald P. "Ella Thea Smith and the Lost History of American High School Biology Textbooks." Journal of the History of Biology 41, no. 3 (2008): 435-71.&lt;/ref&gt; These oaths centered upon restricting instructors to teaching content that did not contradict traditionalist ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ladoucer(2008).435.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''New Civic Biology''==

A revised edition&lt;ref&gt;George William Hunter, ''New Civic Biology: Presented in Problems'', New York: American Book Co., 1926&lt;/ref&gt; of Hunter's book appeared the year after the [[Scopes Trial]]. This new edition no longer used the word "evolution", and removed most references to recognizably evolutionary concepts. A figure illustrating fossils of the precursors of horses in geological context and much of the associated text was eliminated. The section quoted above, "Evolution of Man", was renamed "Development of Man", and, rather than saying "lower in mental organization" said "lower in civilization" (page 250). The book did mention [[natural selection]] (page 383), [[homology (biology)|homology]] (page 237), [[Scientific classification|classification of plants and animals]] (Chapter XXI, pages 234–252) (including mention of "man" as a vertebrate, a mammal, and a primate, page 250), and had a short biography of [[Charles Darwin]] among the "Great Names in Biology" (pages 411–412).&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Education'' 105, no. 2 (1927): 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

This new edition contained an extended discussion of [[eugenics]] (Chapter XXXII "The Improvement of the Human Race", pages 394–404), but the section quoted above on "The Remedy" removed the words "If such people were lower animals, we would probably kill them off to prevent them from spreading. Humanity will not allow this ...". (page 400). The supposed history of the [[Jukes family]] and the [[The Kallikak Family|Kallikak family]] was advanced (pages 398–399). The section "Parasitism and its Cost to Society" was unchanged but for the insertion of the sentence "It is estimated that between 25% and 50% of all prisoners in penal institutions are feeble-minded."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Education'' 105, no. 2 (1927): 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

This new edition retained the section "The Races of Man" as written, with two changes about "caucasians": They were no longer described as "the highest type of all", and "the Hindus and Arabs of Asia" were included among the enumerated caucasians (page 251).&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Education'' 105, no. 2 (1927): 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clayton Howard Riddell''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (July 13, 1937 – September 15, 2018) was a Canadian [[billionaire]] businessman who was the founder, president and CEO of [[Paramount Resources]], based in [[Calgary, Alberta]].

==Early life==
He was born on a farm near [[Treherne, Manitoba]] on July 13, 1937, the youngest child of
Cecil Howard Riddell and Bertha Maude Riddell nee Taylor.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Obituary"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fitterman |first1=Lisa |title=Obituary: Clay Riddell, 81, was a billionaire and philanthropist who thrived in the oil and gas sector |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-clay-riddell-81-was-a-billionaire-and-philanthropist-who-thrived-in/ |accessdate=3 October 2018 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riddell earned with a bachelor's degree in geology from the [[University of Manitoba]].&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Obituary"/&gt;  

==Career==
He also was part owner of the [[Calgary Flames]] and high-end Calgary restaurant Catch. With an estimated net worth of $US 2.5 billion (as of March 2011), he was ranked by [[Forbes]] as the 12th wealthiest Canadian and 459th in the world.&lt;ref name="Forbes2011"&gt;{{cite news | archive-date=March 13, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313032755/http://www.forbes.com/wealth/billionaires/list?country=223&amp;industry=-1&amp;state= | url=http://www.forbes.com/wealth/billionaires/list?country=223&amp;industry=-1&amp;state= | title=The World's Billionaires | work=Forbes | date=March 13, 2011 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riddell was a president of the [[Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists]] and Chair of the [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]].

The Clayton H. Riddell [[Faculty (university)|Faculty]] of Environment, Earth, and Resources at the University of Manitoba is named in his honour. He donated $10 million to create an endowment fund for the faculty, which combines the Department of Environment and Geography, the Department of Geological Sciences and the Natural Resources Institute.

In 2008, Riddell was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] for his leadership and philanthropy.&lt;ref name="GovGen2008"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=5447 | title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada | publisher=[[Governor General of Canada]] | work=Media | date=July 1, 2008 | accessdate=July 19, 2016 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2010, [[Carleton University]] announced the creation of Canada's first graduate program in political management, Clayton H. Riddell Graduate Program in Political Management, made possible through a donation from Riddell that is the largest in Carleton's history.&lt;ref name="Carleton2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2010/06/02/carleton-university-creates-canadas-first-graduate-program-in-political-management-with-largest-ever-financial-commitment/ |title=Carleton University creates Canada's first graduate program in political management with largest ever financial commitment |work=Carleton Newsroom |publisher=Carleton University |date=June 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719210457/http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2010/06/02/carleton-university-creates-canadas-first-graduate-program-in-political-management-with-largest-ever-financial-commitment/ |archivedate=July 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clinical study design''' is the formulation of [[clinical trial|trials]] and experiments, as well as observational studies in medical, clinical and other types of research (e.g., epidemiological) involving human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miquel Porta]] (2014) "[http://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-dictionary-of-epidemiology-9780199976737?cc=us&amp;lang=en A dictionary of epidemiology]", 6th edn, New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199976737}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of a clinical study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and / or the mechanism of action of an investigational medicinal product or procedure, or new drug or device that is in development, but potentially not yet approved by a health authority (e.g. [[Food and Drug Administration]]). It can also be to investigate a drug, device or procedure that has already been approved but is still in need of further investigation, typically with respect to long-term effects or cost-effectiveness.

Some of the considerations here are shared under the more general topic of [[design of experiments]] but there can be others, in particular related to patient confidentiality and ethics.

==Outline of types of designs for clinical studies==

===Treatment studies===
* [[Randomized controlled trial]]
** [[Blind experiment|Blind trial]]
** [[Open-label trial|Non-blind trial]]
* [[Adaptive clinical trial]]
* [[Quasi-experiment|Nonrandomized trial]] (quasi-experiment)
** [[Interrupted time series design]] (measures on a sample or a series of samples from the same population are obtained several times before and after a manipulated event or a naturally occurring event) - considered a type of quasi-experiment

===Observational studies===
1. Descriptive
*[[Case report]]
*[[Case series]]
*[[Population study]]

2. Analytical
*  [[Cohort study]]
** [[Prospective cohort study|Prospective cohort]]
** [[Retrospective cohort study|Retrospective cohort]]
** [[Time series|Time series study]]
* [[Case-control study]]
** [[Nested case-control study]]
* [[Cross-sectional study]]
** Community survey (a type of cross-sectional study)
* [[Ecological study]]

==Important considerations==
When choosing a study design, many factors must be taken into account.  Different types of studies are subject to different types of bias.  For example, '''recall bias''' is likely to occur in cross-sectional or case-control studies where subjects are asked to recall exposure to risk factors.  Subjects with the relevant condition (e.g. breast cancer) may be more likely to recall the relevant exposures that they had undergone (e.g. hormone replacement therapy) than subjects who don't have the condition.

The [[ecological fallacy]] may occur when conclusions about individuals are drawn from analyses conducted on grouped data.  The nature of this type of analysis tends to overestimate the degree of association between variables.

===Seasonal studies===
Conducting studies in seasonal indications (such as allergies, [[Seasonal Affective Disorder]], [[influenza]], and others) can complicate a trial as patients must be enrolled quickly. Additionally, seasonal variations and weather patterns can affect a seasonal study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appliedclinicaltrialsonline.findpharma.com/appliedclinicaltrials/Drug+Development/Flu-Season-Diseases-Affect-Trials/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/652128|title=Flu, Season, Diseases Affect Trials|publisher=[[Applied Clinical Trials]] Online|author1=Yamin Khan |author2=Sarah Tilly |accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharm-olam.com/pdf/POI-Seasonality.pdf|title=Seasonality: The Clinical Trial Manager's Logistical Challenge|publisher=published by: Pharm-Olam International (POI)|author1=Yamin Khan |author2=Sarah Tilly |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terms==
* The term ''retrospective study'' is sometimes used as another term for a [[case-control study]]. This use of the term "retrospective study" is misleading, however, and should be avoided because other research designs besides case-control studies are also retrospective in orientation.
* ''Superiority trials'' are designed to demonstrate that one treatment is more effective than a given reference treatment. This type of study design is often used to test the effectiveness of a treatment compared to [[placebo]] or to the currently best available treatment. 
* ''Non-inferiority trials'' are designed to demonstrate that a treatment is at least not appreciably less effective than a given reference treatment. This type of study design is often employed when comparing a new treatment to an established [[Standard of care#Medical standard of care|medical standard of care]], in situations where the new treatment is cheaper, safer or more convenient than the reference treatment and would therefore be preferable if not appreciably less effective.
* ''Equivalence trials'' are designed to demonstrate that two treatments are equally effective.
* When using "parallel groups", each patient receives one treatment; in a "[[crossover study]]", each patient receives several treatments but in different order.
* A [[longitudinal study]] assesses research subjects over two or more points in time; by contrast, a [[cross-sectional study]] assesses research subjects at only one point in time (so case-control, cohort, and randomized studies are ''not'' cross-sectional).

'''Codevelopment''' is a trend of thought and a development strategy in [[development studies]]
which considers [[Human migration|migrants]] to be a developing factor for their countries of origin.

Although it is widely accepted that it was [[France|French]] scholar [[Sami Naïr]] who first coined the word codevelopment, it is believed this phenomenon has existed alongside migrations since they exist. Traditionally, immigrants (especially those who migrate for economic reasons) have, collectively or individually, supported their communities of origin.

In 1997 Sami Naïr, while directing the Interministerial Mission on Migration/Codevelopment, defined this last concept as ''a proposal for integrating immigration and development in a way that migration fluxes will benefit both the country of origin and the country of destination. This is, a consensual relationship between two countries that will allow migration to the country of destiny not to imply an equivalent loss in the country of origin''.

Adherents to this model believe that it fosters mutual collaboration among countries in a way that traditional and hierarchical north-south development focus did not.
In this context, immigrant initiatives enrich the countries of origin both from a cultural and a [[human resources]] perspective. Their condition as transnational citizens would allow them a better understanding of the needs of both the communities of origin and destination.
For this reason, their participation in projects involving members of their communities, in both “their” countries would be more effective, as priorities and needs would be correctly identified.
On the other hand, this participation would also work as an integrating force in the destination countries, as they would be perceived as an enriching factor by the public opinion and institutions.

== Codevelopment and migration control ==

In countries receiving immigration, codevelopment has been implemented by the institutions in a different way. Since they were first implemented in France, codevelopment initiatives in Europe have been frequently linked to control of the migration fluxes, often promoting the return of immigrants.

At a European level, codevelopment was first mentioned during the [[Tampere Summit]] held in October 1999, when the [[European Council]] defined 5 guidelines for the new European migration policy aimed at a common space of ''"Liberty, Security and Justice".''
Anyhow, critics consider that Tampere quickly shifted towards a [[Fortress Europe]] mentality, limiting [[development aid]] to those countries willing to implement migration control measures and accepting repatriations.

An example of this tendency may be found in the imbalance between de 23 million euro budget that the [[European Union|EU]] plans on investing in the [[Schengen Information System]] and the [[Visa Information System]] (aimed at a further immigrant identification and control) with the 3 million euro budget (4 million in its second year) granted to codevelopment projects.

== Codevelopment in Spain ==

Since the late nineties, codevelopment has been the subject of postgraduate studies, specialist courses, discussions and forums among multiple stakeholders, as well as calls for project grants by some local and regional administrations, beginning with the Municipality of Madrid.  These authorities quickly became aware of the local impact of the presence of new immigrant communities, the importance of the links that bind them with their communities of origin, and the desirability of relating them in any future action to support the policies of cooperation. Codevelopment policies had a much stronger presence and development in the regional and local levels.

At the state level, in accordance with Tampere Summit on Migration, the GRECO Plan on migration management (Programa Global de Regulación y Coordinación de la Extranjería y la Inmigración 2000-2004), was launched by the Interior Ministry in 2001. This Plan devoted an important space for “joint development”, in line with the policies of Tampere and the French government. GRECO insisted on technical and educational cooperation, the voluntary return of migrants, the channelling of migrants’ remittances to development projects, and finally, on the cooperation with those governments that were ready to accept the returned illegal migrants, as well as to control the exit of their citizens with destination Spain. However, codevelopment was not even mentioned as a policy line in the Immigration law passed in 2000, and did not receive proper funding within the GRECO’s framework.

Since ending 2004, codevelopment policies have been open to discussion, including the contents, limits, and plans. Two state agencies claimed their space in codevelopment actions: the State Secretary for International Cooperation, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the brand new General Directorate of Immigrants’ Integration, at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.

===Codevelopment policy ===

During 2005 there has been progress in the search for a consensus on competences and actors. A codevelopment line was mainstreamed in the Master Plans on Development Cooperation, and two years later, also in the new Integration Plan, called Strategic Plan on Citizenship and Integration 2007-2010, which was finally implemented in 2007, by the Ministry of Labour and Migration.

Regional and local authorities soon adopted this win/win approach and consequently launched several codevelopment guidelines within their Integration Plans and Development Cooperation Strategies. Ending 2009, most of the Spanish Regions (Comunidades Autónomas) had considered codevelopment and had set up budget lines both for migrants' associations and Development NGOs. Graciela Malgesini argues that codevelopment and migrants' remittances partly redirect the decentralized cooperation funds to their countries of origin.

===Current definitions of codevelopment ===

In the last ten years, academic research on codevelopment increased, as a result of the strong immigration process experienced by the Spanish society from 2000 onwards (which represented nearly 80% of Spain’s demographic growth). Many universities decided to open up new learning courses on the matter, following the steps of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. Several doctoral thesis are currently being carried out, focusing diverse aspects of codevelopment, including the impact of migration and remittances in the sending countries, mainly Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco. Migrants living in Spain remitted nearly EURO 10 thousands millions, in 2007 (while the overall Spanish OAD summed only half of this amount).

According to Graciela Malgesini, spontaneous codevelopment could be defined as the win/win effect, the linkage between migration and development, which generates mostly positive impacts on both the society of origin of immigrants, and the host society. This definition presumes the role of immigrants as actors and vectors of development, in "both sides", and the understanding of the relations between host countries (North) and sending countries (South) in a horizontal way. Codevelopment is directly related to Transnationalism.

Carlos Gimenez pinpointed other two characteristics of codevelopment: (1) The multiplicity of stakeholders (a network of participants that surpasses both quantitatively and qualitatively the traditional agents in the traditional development cooperation projects, as it includes authorities, social organizations, trade unions, universities, training institutes, businesses and immigrant associations). (2) Transnational citizenship (immigrants acting in codevelopment activities, embedded in a transnational dynamic, are also transnational citizens, to the extent that they have a dual presence. This dual space of belonging, in turn, encourages decision making, influences on the economic, political and social development, and allows the formation of a separate identity, based on two geographical areas, the country of origin and the country of destination).

===Codevelopment in practice ===

Transnationalism and codevelopment are spreading.In Latin America, covedelopment is a relatively new idea, but it has been embraced by grassroots organizations. For example, on November 25, 2010, FAMIGRANTES—the Federation of associations gathering migrants' family members in South America—gathered in their 4th Meeting on Migration and Codevelopment, in Rosario, Argentina. They stated that the codevelopment approach was the best way of understanding the contribution that their relatives were making both in the reception countries and in their homelands (www.famigrantes.org and www.famisur.org). At the same time, more than 100 migrants' associations launched FEDACOD (Federation of Associations for Codevelopment) in Valencia, Spain, on September 24, 2010 (www.fedacod.com).

This figure has similarities with Figure 1 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wf5p3_fUxacC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Guarino] and to slide 7 in the talk by [http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/aime05/presentations/Ontology%20Mapping%20A%20Way%20out%20of%20the%20Medical%20Tower%20of%20Babel.pdf  van Harmelen].

In [[information science]] a '''conceptualization''' is an abstract simplified view of some selected part of the world, containing the objects, concepts, and other entities that are presumed of interest for some particular purpose and the relationships between them.&lt;ref name=Gruber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; An explicit specification of a conceptualization is an [[ontology (information science)|ontology]], and it may occur that a conceptualization can be realized by several distinct ontologies.&lt;ref name=Gruber/&gt;  An ''[[ontological commitment]]'' in describing ontological comparisons is taken to refer to that subset of elements of an ontology shared with all the others.&lt;ref name=Audi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ceccaroni1/&gt;  "An ontology is ''language-dependent''", its objects and interrelations described within the language it uses,  while a conceptualization is always the same, more general, its concepts existing "independently of the language used to describe it".&lt;ref name=Guarino/&gt; The relation between these terms is shown in the figure to the right.

Not all workers in [[knowledge engineering]] use the term ‘conceptualization’, but instead refer to the conceptualization itself, or to the ontological commitment of all its realizations, as an overarching ontology.&lt;ref name=Ceccaroni/&gt;

==Purpose and implementation==
As a higher level abstraction, a conceptualization facilitates the discussion and comparison of its various ontologies, facilitating knowledge sharing and reuse.&lt;ref name=Ceccaroni/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harmelen/&gt; Each ontology based upon the same overarching conceptualization maps the conceptualization into specific elements and their relationships.

The question then arises as to how to describe the 'conceptualization' in terms that can encompass multiple ontologies. This issue has been called the '[[Tower of Babel]]' problem, that is, how can persons used to one ontology talk with others using a different ontology?&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harmelen/&gt; This problem is easily grasped, but a general resolution is not at hand. It can be a 'bottom-up' or a 'top-down' approach, or something in between.&lt;ref name=Alignment/&gt;

However, in more artificial situations, such as information systems, the idea of a 'conceptualization' and the 'ontological commitment' of various ontologies that realize the 'conceptualization' is possible.&lt;ref name=Guarino/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guarino1/&gt; The formation of a conceptualization and its ontologies involves these steps:&lt;ref name=Hadzic/&gt;
* specification of the conceptualization
* ontology concepts: every definition involves the definitions of other terms
* relationships between the concepts: this step maps conceptual relationships onto the ontology structure
* groups of concepts: this step may lead to the creation of sub-ontologies
* formal description of ontology commitments, for example, to make them computer readable

An example of moving conception into a language leading to a variety of ontologies is the expression of a process in [[pseudocode]] (a strictly structured form of ordinary language) leading to implementation in several different formal computer languages like [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] or [[Fortran]]. The pseudocode makes it easier to understand the instructions and compare implementations, but the formal languages make possible the compilation of the ideas as computer instructions. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Another example is mathematics, where a very general formulation (the analog of a conceptualization) is illustrated with 'applications' that are more specialized examples. For instance, aspects of a [[function space]] can be illustrated using a [[vector space]] or a [[topological space]] that introduce interpretations of the 'elements' of the conceptualization and additional relationships between them but preserve the connections required in the [[function space]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

&lt;ref name=Alignment&gt;
In information science, one approach to finding a conceptualization (or avoiding it and using an automated comparison) is called 'ontology alignment' or 'ontology matching'. See for example, {{cite book |title=Ontology Matching |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYVpA2t2EtQC&amp;printsec=frontcover  |author1=Jérôme.

:The ''ontological commitments'' of a theory are those things which occur in all the ''ontologies'' of that theory. To explain further, the [[ontology]] of a theory consists of the objects the theory makes use of. A dependence of a theory upon an object is indicated if the theory fails when the object is omitted. However, the ontology of a theory is not necessarily unique. A theory is ''ontologically committed'' to an object only if that object occurs in ''all'' the ontologies of that theory. A theory also can be ''ontologically committed'' to a class of objects if that class is populated (not necessarily by the same objects) in all its ontologies. [italics added]

'''''Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things''''' is a 2002 non-fiction book by German chemist [[Michael Braungart]] and U.S. architect [[William McDonough]]. It is a [[manifesto]] detailing how to achieve their [[Cradle to Cradle Design]] model. It calls for a radical change in industry: a switch from a [[Cradle-to-grave analysis#Cradle-to-grave|cradle-to-grave]] pattern to a [[Cradle to Cradle Design|cradle-to-cradle]] pattern. It suggests that the "[[reduce reuse recycle]]" methods perpetuate this cradle-to-grave strategy, and that more changes need to be made.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cradle to Cradle|url=http://us.macmillan.com/cradletocradle|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book discourages [[downcycling]], but rather encourages the manufacture of products with the goal of [[upcycling]] in mind.&lt;ref name="Powell's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780865475878-0|publisher=Powell's Books|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vision of upcycling is based on a system of "lifecycle development" initiated by Braungart and colleagues at the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency in the 1990s: after products have reached the end of their useful life, they become either "biological nutrients" or "technical nutrients". Biological nutrients are materials that can re-enter the environment. Technical nutrients are materials that remain within closed-loop industrial cycles.&lt;ref name="Speakers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Waste equals food|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0iwT-7UkKX0J:epea-hamburg.org/fileadmin/downloads/2009/35984_Speakers%2520Academy%2520Magazine%2520michaelbraugart%25202009.PDF+%22lifecycle+development%22+epea&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiE8v5xm57jGDpK5v4jTJabAyDDFgTx1IreGTkuIL9Vfp1VmeTrKxL987FIGlaebh60edoSGPAaID93gLC7-_ks2APuH884qs3LBAoyv39t0zbR7YYH8ZYG9l7T546Dmu8U93HJ&amp;sig=AHIEtbQlyv0k1XqSdWqycL8WRob5MyfR-w|publisher=Speakers Academy Magazine|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book uses historical examples such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] along with commentary on science, nature, and society.&lt;ref name=C2C /&gt;

==Background==
William McDonough and Michael Braungart met at an Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency reception in [[New York City]]. They began discussing [[toxicity]] and design. They were immediately interested in working together to create a better world for each other, and in 1991 they coauthored ''The Hannover Principles'': a set of design guidelines for the 2000 [[World's Fair]] that were issued at the 1992 World Urban Forum and United Nations forum of the Earth Summit. In 1995 they founded McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, a firm to assist companies in implementing sustainable design protocols.&lt;ref name=C2C /&gt;

==Publication==
The book was published in 2002 by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux|North Point Press]]. The book itself is printed using [[Melcher Media#DuraBooks|DuraBook]] technology. The pages are not paper, but rather synthetics created from [[synthetic resin|plastic resins]] and [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] [[Filler (materials)|fillers]]. The books are more durable and strong than traditional paper books, waterproof, and upcyclable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DuraBooks|url=http://www.durabooks.com/about_durabooks.html|publisher=Durabooks|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a "technical nutrient" in the lifecycle development system.&lt;ref name="C2C"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonough|first=William|title=Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things|year=2002|publisher=North Point Press|isbn=0-86547-587-3|pages=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFX5RprPGQ0C|author2=Braungart, Michael|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been translated into 12 languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10610">[[File:Deformable mirror correction.svg|thumb|A '''deformable mirror''' can be used to correct wavefront errors in an astronomical telescope.]]
'''Deformable mirrors''' (DM) are [[mirror]]s whose surface can be deformed, in order to achieve [[wavefront]] control and correction of optical [[Optical aberration|aberration]]s. Deformable mirrors are used in combination with [[wavefront sensor]]s and real-time control systems in [[adaptive optics]]. In 2006 they found a new use in [[femtosecond pulse shaping]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adaptiveoptics.org/News_0106_2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of a DM can be controlled with a speed that is appropriate for compensation of dynamic aberrations present in the optical system. In practice the DM shape should be changed much faster than the process to be corrected, as the correction process, even for a static aberration, may take several iterations.

A DM usually has many degrees of freedom. Typically, these degrees of freedom are associated with the mechanical [[actuator]]s and it can be roughly taken that one actuator corresponds to one [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]].

== Deformable mirror parameters ==
[[File:The VLT’s new Deformable Secondary Mirror.jpg|thumb|The [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]’s Deformable Secondary Mirror&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The VLT’s new Deformable Secondary Mirror|url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/ann16078a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Number of actuators''' determines the number of degrees of freedom (wavefront [[Inflection point|inflections]]) the mirror can correct. It is very common to compare an arbitrary DM to an ideal device that can perfectly reproduce wavefront modes in the form of  [[Zernike polynomials]]. For predefined statistics of aberrations a deformable mirror with M actuators can be equivalent to an ideal Zernike corrector with N (usually N &lt; M) degrees of freedom. For correction of the atmospheric turbulence, elimination of low-order Zernike terms usually results in significant improvement of the image quality, while further correction of the higher-order terms introduces less significant improvements. For strong and rapid wavefront error fluctuations such as shocks and wake turbulence typically encountered in high-speed aerodynamic flowfields, the number of actuators, actuator pitch and stroke determine the maximum wavefront gradients that can be compensated for.

'''Actuator pitch''' is the distance between actuator centers. Deformable mirrors with large actuator pitch and large number of actuators are bulky and expensive.

'''Actuator stroke''' is the maximum possible actuator displacement, typically in positive or negative excursions from some central null position.  Stroke typically ranges from ±1 to ±30 micrometres.  Free actuator stroke limits the maximum amplitude of the corrected wavefront, while the inter-actuator stroke limits the maximum amplitude and gradients of correctable higher-order aberrations.

'''Influence function''' is the characteristic shape corresponding to the mirror response to the action of a single actuator. Different types of deformable mirrors have different influence functions, moreover the influence functions can be different for different actuators of the same mirror. Influence function that covers the whole mirror surface is called a "modal" function, while localized response is called  "zonal".

'''Actuator coupling''' shows how much the movement of one actuator will displace its neighbors.  All "modal" mirrors have large cross-coupling, which in fact is good as it secures the high quality of correction of smooth low-order optical aberrations that usually have the highest statistical weight.

'''Response time'''  shows how quickly the mirror will react to the control signal. Can vary from microseconds (MEMS and magnetics mirrors) to tens of seconds for thermally controlled DM's.

'''[[Hysteresis]] and creep''' are nonlinear actuation effects that decrease the precision of the response of the deformable mirror.  For different concepts, the hysteresis can vary from zero (electrostatically-actuated mirrors) to tens of percent for mirrors with piezoelectric actuators. Hysteresis is a residual positional error from previous actuator position commands, and limits the mirror ability to work in a feedforward mode, outside of a feedback loop.

'''Segmented concept''' mirrors are formed by independent flat mirror segments. Each segment can move a small distance back and forth to approximate the average value of the wavefront over the patch area. Advantageously, these mirrors have little or zero cross-talk between actuators. Stepwise approximation works poorly for smooth continuous wavefronts. Sharp edges of the segments and gaps between the segments contribute to light scattering, limiting the applications to those not sensitive to scattered light. Considerable improvement of the performance of the segmented mirror can be achieved by introduction of three degrees of freedom per segment: piston, tip and tilt. These mirrors require three times as many actuators compared to piston segmented mirrors. This concept was used for fabrication of large segmented primary mirrors for the [[Keck telescopes]], [[JWST]], and the future [[E-ELT]]. Numerous methods exist to accurately co-phase the segments and reduce the diffraction patterns introduced by the segment shapes and gaps. Future large space-based telescopes, such as the NASA [[ATLAST]] will also possess a segmented primary mirror. The development of robust methods to increase the contrast is key for the direct imaging and characterization of [[exoplanets]].

'''Continuous faceplate concept''' mirrors with discrete actuators are formed by the front surface of a thin deformable membrane. The shape of the plate is controlled by a number of discrete actuators that are fixed to its back side. The shape of the mirror depends on the combination of forces applied to the faceplate, boundary conditions (the way the plate is fixed to the mirror) and the geometry and the material of the plate. These mirrors allow smooth wavefront control with very large - up to several thousands - degrees of freedom.

'''Magnetics concept''' mirrors are based on continuous reflective surface motioned by magnetics actuators. They feature large strokes, linearity and fast settling time.

'''[[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] concept''' mirrors are fabricated using bulk and surface micromachining technologies. MEMS mirrors have a great potential to be cheap. They could break the high price threshold of conventional [[adaptive optics]]. MEMS mirrors typically have high response rates, limited hysteresis.

'''Membrane concept''' mirrors are formed by a thin conductive and reflective membrane stretched over a solid flat frame. The membrane can be deformed electrostatically by applying control voltages to electrostatic electrode actuators that can be positioned under or over the membrane. If there are any electrodes positioned over the membrane, they are transparent. It is possible to operate the mirror with only one group of electrodes positioned under the mirror. In this case a bias voltage is applied to all electrodes, to make the membrane initially spherical. The membrane can move back and forth with respect to the reference sphere.

[[File:Ferrofluid Deformable mirror.JPG|thumb|A ferrofluid deformable mirror]]
'''Bimorph concept''' mirrors are formed by two or more layers of different materials. One or more of (active) layers are fabricated from a piezoelectric or electrostrictive material. Electrode structure is patterned on the active layer to facilitate local response. The mirror is deformed when a voltage is applied to one or more of its electrodes, causing them to extend laterally, which results in local mirror curvature. Bimorph mirrors are rarely made with more than 100 electrodes.

'''[[Ferrofluid]] concept''' mirrors are [[Ferrofluid mirror|liquid deformable mirrors]] made with a suspension of small (about 10&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter) ferromagnetic nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid carrier. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the ferromagnetic particles align with the field, the liquid becomes magnetized and its surface acquires a shape governed by the equilibrium between the magnetic, gravitational and surface tension forces. Using proper magnetic field geometries, any desired shape can be produced at the surface of the ferrofluid. This new concept offers a potential alternative for low-cost, high stroke and large number of actuators deformable mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ferrofluid Based Deformable Mirrors - a New Approach to Adaptive Optics Using Liquid Mirrors|date=August 2002|series=Proceedings of SPIE Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation meeting|doi=10.1117/12.459065|arxiv=astro-ph/0212189|author=P.

The term '''e-Research''' (alternately spelled '''eResearch''') refers to the use of [[information technology]] to support existing and new forms of research.  E-research extends [[e-Science]] and [[cyberinfrastructure]] to other disciplines, including the humanities and social sciences.

==Overview==
Examples of e-Research problems range across disciplines which include:

==== Modelling of ecosystems or economies - ====

==== Exploration of human genome structures - ====

==== Studies of large linguistic corpora - ====

==== Integrated social policy analyses - ====

=== Principle features of e-Research include: ===

==== Collaboration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = e-Research Collaboration - Theory, Techniques and {{!}} Murugan Anandarajan {{!}} Springer|url = https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642122569|website = www.springer.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - ====

==== Use of [[grid-computing]] technologies - ====

==== [[Data-intensive computing|data-intensive]] activity - ====
E-Research includes research activities that use a spectrum of advanced [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) capabilities. It embraces new research methodologies emerging from increasing access to:

* networks
* services
* tools

==In Australia==
Specialist services, centres or programmes instituted to support [[Australia]]n data and technology intensive research operate under the umbrella term: eResearch.  In March 2012, representatives from these eResearch groups came together to discuss the need build a "collaborative program to strengthen eResearch and address issues facing the sector nationally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intersect Newsletter, 6 March 2012|url=http://www.intersect.org.au/intersect-newsletter-18|website=Intersect Australia|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Australian eResearch Organisation (AeRO) emerged from this forum as "a collaborative organisation of national and state-based research organisations to advance eResearch implementation and innovation in Australia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://aero.edu.au/|website=Australian eResearch Organisation (AeRO)|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Professionals working in Australian eResearch annually convene a conference known as: eResearch Australasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/eres2015/about/|website = eResearch Australasia Conference|accessdate = 15 January 2016|date = |title = About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fluid pipes''' are a phenomenon driven by [[surface tension]].  When a pure water jet impinges on a reservoir, [[capillary wave]]s are excited and propagate up the jet at the same speed that the jet falls.

Fluid pipe phenomenon may be observed with a kitchen faucet. When the diameter of the stream is 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm, placing an obstacle in the stream will give the desired effect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hancock|first=Matthew J.|last2=Bush|first2=John W.

'''Geoff Goodfellow''' (born 1956 in California) associated with early [[wireless email]] ventures.

==Technology career==
In 1982 he posted a message titled "Electronic Mail for People on the Move" in an [[arpanet]] mailing list called Telecom Digest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iconia.com/TELECOMDigestV2.33.txt 1982 message digest]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s Goodfellow attempted to commercialize this concept in a product called [[RadioMail]]. In 1992, Radiomail entered into a partnership with [[Research in Motion]], [[RAM Mobile Data]], and [[Ericsson]].  Goodfellow left the company in 1996.

Goodfellow, a contributor to the ''[[Jargon File]]'' and participant in the early days of the [[Silicon Valley]] computer culture, did not believe in patenting his idea. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "You don't patent the obvious...The way you compete is to build something that is faster, better, cheaper. You don't lock your ideas up in a patent and rest on your laurels." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Markoff|title=In Silicon Valley, a Man Without a Patent|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 16, 2006|page=1, section 3|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/technology/16wireless.html?ei=5090&amp;en=76984460580ca72a&amp;ex=1302840000&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/16/business/goodfellow.php/&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventor, [[Thomas J. Campana Jr.]], was granted several patents covering his inventions related to the practical implementation of wireless e-mail. In 2006, after a protracted legal battle, (See [[NTP Inc.]])  Research in Motion had to pay $US 615 million to obtain rights to these patents.

In 2006 Goodfellow began researching the cause, nature and origin of what he regards as the critical state of disharmony on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;http://iconia.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glasgow Science Centre''' is a visitor attraction located in the [[Clyde Waterfront Regeneration]] area on the south bank of the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] opened Glasgow Science Centre on 5 June 2001. It is one of Scotland's most popular paid-for visitor attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35690252 |title=Visitor numbers up at Scots attractions |publisher=BBC News |date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a purpose-built [[science centre]] composed of three principal buildings: Science Mall, [[Glasgow Tower]] and an [[IMAX]] [[Movie theater|cinema]]. The Scottish tourist board, [[VisitScotland]], awarded Glasgow Science Centre a five star rating in the visitor attraction category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Science Centre on Visitscotland.com | url=http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5,en,SCH1/objectId,SIG48295Svs,curr,GBP,season,at1,selectedEntry,home/home.html | accessdate=24 July 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004233/http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5%2Cen%2CSCH1/objectId%2CSIG48295Svs%2Ccurr%2CGBP%2Cseason%2Cat1%2CselectedEntry%2Chome/home.html | archivedate=27 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as its main location, Glasgow Science Centre also manages the visitor centre at [[Whitelee Wind Farm]], which opened to the public in 2009.

==Science Mall==
[[File:Glasgow Science Centre from the west.jpg|thumb|330px|Glasgow Science Centre from the west]]
The largest of the three main, titanium-clad buildings takes a crescent shape structure and houses a Science Mall. In architectural terms it represents the canted hull of a ship, a reference to the adjacent 'canting basin', where vessels were brought to have the marine growth removed from their hulls. Internally, there are three floors of over 250 science-learning exhibits. As is usual for science centres, the exhibits aim to encourage interaction, and can be used or played with as part of the informal learning experience the centre aims to deliver. The building was designed by BDP.

On Floor 1, amongst the many interactive exhibits that demonstrate scientific principles, visitors can access a Science Show Theatre and the Glasgow Science Centre Planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=MERO Construction website on the Glasgow Science Centre| url=http://www.merouk.co.uk/structures/2001gsc.htm| accessdate=26 April 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410114702/http://www.merouk.co.uk/structures/2001gsc.htm| archivedate=10 April 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Science Centre webpage on the Science Mall | url=http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/sciencemall_4.aspx | accessdate=26 April 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093046/http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/sciencemall_4.aspx | archivedate=9 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[planetarium]] contains a [[zeiss projector|Zeiss]] [[Planetarium#Traditional electromechanical.2Foptical projectors|optical-mechanical projector]] that projects images of the night sky onto a 15m diameter dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeiss Press release| url=http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/ee1fd0d05bbcc39bc1256b6f003c7d01 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210003926/http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/ee1fd0d05bbcc39bc1256b6f003c7d01 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=10 February 2013 |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeiss installation list| url=http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/cd498b133073712741256a76004e9e4b |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an area specifically aimed at young children, called The Big Explorer.

On Floor 2, visitors can explore opportunities in STEM careers in the My World of Work Live interactive exhibition space. There is also The Lab, primarily used as an educational workshop space.

Floor 3 was refurbished in 2012 and reopened to the public on 28 March 2013. It now houses an interactive exhibition about human health and wellbeing in the 21st century, called BodyWorks. Visitors are invited to consider their bodies, health and lifestyle from a new perspective through 115 interactive exhibits, research capsules and live laboratory experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=What is BodyWorks?| url=http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/bodyworks-newsroom/what-is-bodyworks.html| accessdate=8 April 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022532/http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/bodyworks-newsroom/what-is-bodyworks.html| archivedate=24 September 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ground Floor of the Science Mall contains the ticket desk, cafes, gift shop, and a cloakroom. There are a number of flexible room spaces on the Ground Floor that are used for a variety of educational and corporate purposes: an education space called The Egg; a lecture-theatre space called The Auditorium; and the Clyde Suite, a multi-purpose function space. Access to Glasgow Tower for the public is also via the Ground Floor.

==Glasgow Tower==

{{main|Glasgow Tower}}
The Glasgow Tower was designed to be the tallest freely-rotating tower in the world. It missed its opening date in 2001 and was plagued by problems since then. It has been closed for over 80% of its life,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and was closed from August 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22509056|title=BBC News - Faulty tower: Glasgow's £10m white elephant|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; until July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-28366052|title=BBC News - Glasgow Science Centre tower reopens|date=19 July 2014|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMAX Cinema==

The IMAX cinema was the first IMAX cinema to be built in Scotland. The single auditorium seats 370 in front of a rectangular screen measuring {{convert|80|ft|m}} by {{convert|60|ft|m}} and has the capability to show [[3-D film|3D films]] as well as standard 2D films in IMAX format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Big Movie Zone | url=http://www.bigmoviezone.com/txshows/theaters/index.html?uniq=695 | accessdate=17 September 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604041706/http://www.bigmoviezone.com/txshows/theaters/index.html?uniq=695 | archivedate=4 June 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened to the public in October 2000, and premiered the first film, entitled "Dolphins", several months prior to the opening of the two other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Millennium Commission News October 2000 | url=http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=1184&amp;d=11&amp;h=24&amp;f=46&amp;dateformat=%25o-%25B-%25Y | accessdate=24 July 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010424/http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=1184&amp;d=11&amp;h=24&amp;f=46&amp;dateformat=%25o-%25B-%25Y | archivedate=28 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September 2013, [[Cineworld]] agreed a 10-year lease to operate the IMAX cinema and opened a [[Starbucks]] on site.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Glasgow garden festival overhead.jpg|thumb|270px|right|View of the [[Glasgow Garden Festival]] site]]
Opened to the public in June 2001, Glasgow Science Centre is part of the ongoing redevelopment of [[Pacific Quay]], an area which was once a cargo port known as Prince's Dock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science on the Clyde |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1394637.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 April 2008 |date=19 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Architecture website on Pacific Quay | url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/pacific_quay.htm |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redevelopment started with the [[Glasgow Garden Festival]] in 1988. As with the other [[National Garden Festival]]s, the {{convert|100|acre|km2}} Glasgow site was intended to be sold off for housing development, but due to a housing slump in 1987, the developers were unable to develop the land as they intended, and the majority of the site remained derelict for years. Parts were finally redeveloped for the Science Centre and also [[Pacific Quay]], including new headquarters for [[BBC Scotland]] and [[Scottish Television]], opened in 2007. The Clydesdale Bank Tower was dismantled and re-erected in [[Rhyl]] in North [[Wales]], however its spiritual successor came in the form of the [[Glasgow Tower]] as part of Science Centre complex, which stands on approximately the same spot.

The architects of the Glasgow Science Centre were [[Building Design Partnership]], however the Glasgow Tower was originally designed by the architect Richard Horden with engineering design by [[Buro Happold]].&lt;ref name="hcla.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web | title=Horden Cherry Lee Architects | url=http://www.hcla.co.uk/projects/?prorub1=ap&amp;prorub2=5&amp;pid=67

==Funding issues==
In June 2004, it was announced that about a fifth of the workforce were to be made redundant following the creation of a funding deal with the [[Scottish Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Redundancies at science centre |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3851349.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 July 2008 |date=29 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the leader of the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]], [[Nicol Stephen]], stated that Glasgow Science Centre was facing a 40% cut in government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science centre '40% funding cut' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7437912.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 July 2008 |date=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] commented on this issue during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] saying, "It's unfortunate in Glasgow that as a result of the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], funding has been cut, and they will live to regret that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Evening Times News Report | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2376867.0.0.php|accessdate= 3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although funding for the Scottish Science Centres as a whole has actually increased, it is now being split between four centres using a formula based on visitor numbers, and Glasgow is the only centre to face a reduction in budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SNP News Release | url=http://www.snp.org/node/14009 | accessdate=3 July 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012181805/http://www.snp.org/node/14009 | archivedate=12 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the announcement in July 2008 that 28 full-time jobs were to be cut as a direct consequence of the cuts "in order to secure Glasgow Science Centre's future", according to the Chief Executive, Kirk Ramsay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Troubled science centre cuts jobs |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7487335.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 July 2008 |date=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
Glasgow Science Centre is located in the [[Pacific Quay]] area, and as such, is surrounded by the media centres that form the Digital Media Quarter, a [[Scottish Enterprise]] development initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Digital Media Quarter webpage | url=http://www.pacificquaydmq.com/|accessdate= 10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the opening of the new [[STV (TV network)|STV]] headquarters in June 2006 and the beginning of broadcast programming from [[BBC Pacific Quay]] in the summer of 2004, it can be expected that more programming will be filmed in the area.

In the [[CBeebies]] television programme ''[[Nina and the Neurons]]'', the title character Nina is a [[neuroscientist]] who works at Glasgow Science Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CBeebies Nina and the Neurons webpage | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/ninaandtheneurons.shtml | accessdate=28 April 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514133942/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/ninaandtheneurons.shtml | archivedate=14 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Nina is played by the actress [[Katrina Bryan]] who is not a staff member at Glasgow Science Centre.

'''The Global Energy Prize''' is an international award which recognises outstanding scientific innovations and solutions in global energy research and its concurrent environmental challenges. Since its inception in 2002, the Global Energy Prize has grown to become a recognised global energy award. According to [http://ireg-observatory.org/en/pdfy/ireg-list-academic-awards.pdf IREG Observatory on Academic Ranking and Excellence], the Global Energy Prize is one of TOP-99 international academic awards with the highest prestige and significance. It is the only award from Russia included in the IREG list.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.miragenews.com/unsw-solar-expert-is-first-australian-to-win-international-energy-prize/&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Global Energy Prize is included in the official list of [http://www.icda.org/images/2014_World_of_Awards_Analysis_1_.pdf the International Congress of Distinguished Awards (ICDA)]. In ICDA prestige rating the Global Energy Prize is in the category of “Mega Prizes” for its laudable goals, practices exemplary and the overall prize fund. Three leading Russian energy companies support and provide funding the prize: [[Gazprom|JSC Gazprom]], [[Surgutneftegas|JSC Surgutneftegaz]] and [[FGC UES|JSC Federal Grid Company UES]].

The Global Energy Prize is awarded annually in Russia by the [[President of the Russian Federation]] or person on his behalf. Each laureate receives, amongst others, a commemorative medal and a monetary prize. In 2017 the Prize fund amounted to 39 million RUB. The award process is overseen by the Global Energy Prize International Award Committee, which consists of 20 scientists from 13 countries and is chaired by renowned British scientist [[Rodney John Allam]].

The Global Energy Prize is managed by the Global Energy Association.

== History ==
The Global Energy Prize was founded in October 2002 by leading Russian energy companies and endorsed by the President of the Russian Federation.

Since the first awards ceremony in 2003, the award has been presented to 37 laureates from 12 countries: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, Japan, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the UK and the US. The Global Energy Prize laureates include, amongst others, prominent scientists including [[Arthur Rosenfeld]], awarded for his pioneering work in energy efficiency, and [[Gennady Mesyats]], awarded for fundamental research and development in the field of powerful pulse energy.

=== The Global Energy Association ===
The Global Energy Prize is managed by the Global Energy Association which is responsible for the organisational, financial and informational management of the Global Energy Prize. The Association is managed by the Board of Trustees, headed by Alexander Shokhin, Head of Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and other representatives of Russian academia of Sciences, politics and energy sphere, including the Nobel Peace Prize winner Mikhail Gorbachev. The Board, formed by the Global Energy Association and renewed every 5 years, is responsible for general management of the nomination process and the awarding of the Prize. The members of the Board of Trustees do not take part in the nomination process, nor do they make a final decision on awarding.

The Global Energy Association manages a range of awards and projects related to the promotion of science and innovation in the field of energy:

* The Energy of Breakthrough - An All-Russian contest of implemented innovative projects in the field of energy. Russian scientists, PHD students and specialists of industry organizations under 45 years of age are eligible to participate. The key criterion is to show that the development is successfully applied in practice. The contest is held annually since 2014. The winner gets a 1 million rubles prize. The total number of monetary prizes is 3 million rubles.
* The Energy of Knowledge – A series of interactive lectures given by the laureates of the Global Energy Prize and other prominent energy scholars. The program works to raise interest in energy issues among young people and to unleash the potential of young researchers within the sector. Ultimately, the project aims to increase the number of young energy scientists, as well as to strengthen the knowledge networks under the auspices of the Global Energy Prize.
* The Energy of Start - An All-Russian contest of energy projects for the teenagers. The program’s goal is to form high school students’ positive and responsible attitude to this field of and to reveal most promising young specialists who will certainly bring new benefits to the spheres of energy science and energy business.
* The Energy of Youth – A competition of youth research projects in the energy sector, conducted annually among the core research and educational institutions of the Russian Federation. All scientists participating in the project are under the age of 35 years. The project aims to promote progress in the Russian energy sector, by encouraging young scientists to carry out their research within the field. Each winner gets 1 million rubles for the continuation of research. Since 2004, more than 200 young scientists were awarded. The total sum of grants allocated is 47, 5 million rubles.
* The Energy of Words - An international media competition, which aims to encourage media and individual journalists to cover energy issues.

=== Founders ===
The idea of the Global Energy Prize was developed in 2002 by a group of Russian scientists and was endorsed by Russian energy corporations, President of the Russian Federation, [[Vladimir Putin]], and the scientific community. The Global Energy Fund was set up in October 2002, by three major Russian Energy companies:  [[Gazprom|JSC Gazprom]], [[Federal Grid Company of Russia|JCS Federal Grid Company of the Unified Energy Systems]] (FGC UES, Former JSC Unified Energy Systems of Russia) and Yukos. In 2005, oil and gas company [[Surgutneftegaz|JSC Surgutneftegaz]] joined the group of funding companies.

=== First prizes ===
The first Global Energy Prize awarding ceremony took place in June 2003 at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace|Konstantinovsky Palace, Strelna]] (St Petersburg district, Russia) and was attended by President [[Vladimir Putin]]. The award was presented to three scientists:  Mr [[Nick Holonyak]] (USA), Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics at the University of Illinois, for his contribution to the development of power silicon electronics and the invention of the first semi-conducting light-emitting diodes, Mr Ian Douglas Smith (USA), Chief Manager and Senior Researcher in ‘Titan Pulse Sciences Division’, for his fundamental research and development in the field of powerful pulse energy, and a Russian scientist Mr [[Gennady Mesyats]], then-Chairman of the State Commission for Academic Degrees and Titles of the Russian Federation, for his fundamental research and development in the field of powerful pulse energy.

[[File:Gunung Padang Site.jpg|thumb|alt=Gunung Padang site.|upright=1.2|Gunung Padang site]] '''Gunung Padang''' is a [[megalith]]ic site located in Karyamukti village, [[Cianjur]] regency, [[West Java]] Province of [[Indonesia]], 30&amp;nbsp;km southwest of the city of Cianjur or 6 kilometers from Lampegan station. It has been called the largest megalithic site in all of Southeastern Asia, and has produced carbon dating results which, if confirmed, suggest it is extraordinarily old.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/world/digging-for-the-truth-at-controversial-megalithic-site-20130726-2qphb.html Digging for the truth at controversial megalithic site - Michael Bachelard, Sydney Morning Herald, July 27, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The survey believes that Gunung Padang was built in four different eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sains.kompas.com/read/2014/06/06/1957144/Mari.Terbang.ke.Atas.Situs.Megalitikum.Gunung.Padang |title=Mari Terbang ke Atas Situs Megalitikum Gunung Padang |author=Yunanto Wiji Utomo |date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Gunung Padang 5th terrace.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|A view of Gunung Padang]]
The existence of the site was mentioned in ''Rapporten van de Oudheidkundige Dienst'' (ROD, "Report of the Department of Antiquities") in 1914. The Dutch historian N. J. Krom also mentioned it in 1949. Employees of the National Archeology Research Centre visited the site in 1979 for a study of its archaeology, history, and geology.

Located at 885 metres above sea level, the site covers a hill in a series of terraces bordered by retaining walls of stone that are accessed by about 400 successive [[andesite]] steps rising about 95 metres. It is covered with massive rectangular stones of volcanic origin. The [[Sundanese people]] consider the site sacred and believe it was the result of [[King Siliwangi]]'s attempt to build a palace in one night. The asymmetric [[Step pyramid|Punden Berundak]] faces northwest, to [[Mount Gede]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/151062 |title=From Lampegan to Mount Padang |publisher=Pikiran-rakyat.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was constructed for the purpose of worship.  Based on various dating techniques, the site was completed by 5000 BC and quite likely much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geologi.iagi.or.id/2011/02/22/situs-megalitik-gunung-padang-cianjur-harmoni-bumi-dan-langit/ |title=Situs Megalitik Gunung Padang, Cianjur: Harmoni Bumi dan Langit |date=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The villages closest to the site are Cimanggu, Ciwangun and Cipanggulakan. Two possible routes to access the site are
* From Sukabumi to Cianjur: From Warungkondang to Cipadang, Cibokor, Lampegan Pal Dua, Ciwangin, Cimanggu.
* From Cianjur to Sukabumi: From Sukaraja to Cireungas, Cibanteng, Rawabesar, Sukamukti and Cipanggulaan.

At the end of June 2014, the Education and Culture Ministry declared Gunung Padang Megalithic Site a National Site Area of 29 hectares area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jabar.tribunnews.com/2014/06/25/balai-pengelolaan-dibentuk-setelah-penataan-selesai-dilakukan |title=Balai Pengelolaan Situs Gunung Padang Segera Dibentuk |date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2014, surveyors halted excavation activities temporarily due to these facts and recommendations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jabar.tribunnews.com/2014/10/01/timnas-gunung-padang-hentikan-penelitian |title=Timnas Gunung Padang Hentikan Penelitian |date=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a large structure below the surface
* A core zone site area has been confirmed
* Many man-made artefacts have been discovered
* The construction of the site spans four eras
* A recommendation has been made to extend the survey, renovation concept, conservation and management of the site

The 2014 excavation has been criticized for being improperly conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/09/24/archaeologists-slam-excavation-gunung-padang-site.html|title=Archaeologists slam excavation of Gunung Padang site|work=thejakartapost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 survey==
A survey conducted in 2012 showed the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmol.co/read/2012/06/27/68645/Laporan-Resmi:-Situs-Gunung-Padang-Punya-100-Undakan-dan-Luasnya-25-Hektar- |title=Laporan Resmi: Situs Gunung Padang Punya 100 Undakan dan Luasnya 25 Hektar |date=June 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmol.co/read/2012/06/28/68876/Tim-Terpadu-Riset-Mandiri:-Gunung-Padang-Truly-Extraordinary- |title=Tim Terpadu Riset Mandiri: Gunung Padang Truly Extraordinary |date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The site was dated 6,500 years BP (before present) by carbon radiometric dating at 3–4 metres below the surface (12,500 years at 8 to 10 metres below the surface), and the artifacts at the surface date to about 4,800 years BP.
* Based on geoelectric, georadar, and geomagnetic testing, at least up to 15 metres from the surface there is construction with large chambers.
* Unlike the south side with its 5 stone terraces, the east side has 100 stone terraces with width and height of 2x2 metres.  The west side also has stone terraces but is still covered by soil and bush, and the north side has, in addition to a 1.5 metre-wide stair, terraces also.  
* The site area is approximately 25 hectares, in contrast for example to [[Borobudur]] Temple, which occupies only 1.5 hectares.  
* Wall-side construction of the terraces is similar to that of [[Machu Picchu]] in [[Peru]].

==Criticism==
Thirty-four Indonesian scientists signed a petition questioning the motives and methods of the Hilman-Arif team.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; Vulcanologist Sutikno Bronto states that the site is the neck of an ancient volcano and not a man-made pyramid.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; An unnamed archaeologist suggests that the Hilman-Arif team has "created a civilisation around the period to explain their finding".&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

'''Horizontal correlation''' is a methodology for [[gene|gene sequence]] analysis. Rather than referring to one specific technique, ''horizontal correlation'' instead encompasses a variety of approaches to sequence analysis that are unified by two specific themes:

* Sequence analysis is performed by making comparisons ''horizontally'', along the length of a single genetic sequence; this is in contrast to ''vertical'' methods that make comparisons across several different genetic sequences.
* The comparisons made generally measure [[information theory|information theoretic]] quantities such as value of the [[mutual information]] function between two regions of the sequence.

The core ideas of the horizontal correlation approach were first presented in a year 2000 paper by Grosse, Herzel, Buldyrev, and Stanley (Grosse, et al. 2000). In this first formulation, Grosse and colleagues sought to characterize a large genetic sequence by dividing the sequence into [[genetic code|coding]] and non-coding regions. Whereas traditional approaches to the coding-vs.-non-coding problem generally relied on sophisticated pattern recognition systems that were first trained on small inputs and then run over the entire sequence (Ohler, et al. 1999), the horizontal correlation approach of Grosse and colleagues worked instead by breaking the sequence into many relatively short sequence fragments, each only 500 base pairs in length. They then sought to characterize each of these fragments as either coding or non-coding. This was accomplished by comparing each size 3 window along the length of a fragment with the first size 3 window in that fragment, then measuring the value of the mutual information function between the two windows. Coding sequences were found to display a stylized pattern of 3-periodicity that non-coding sequences did not. Such a pattern was easy to recognize, and enabled significantly more rapid, more species-independent identification of coding regions (Grosse, et al. 2000).

Since 2000, horizontal correlation methodologies emphasizing the measurement of information theoretic quantities along the length of a gene sequence have been put to widespread use, and have even found application in [[shotgun sequencing]] fragment assembly (Otu &amp; Sayood, 2004).

==History==
iNaturalist.org began in 2008 as a [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] [[UC Berkeley School of Information|School of Information]] Master's final project of Nate Agrin, Jessica Kline, and Ken-ichi Ueda.&lt;ref name='about'/&gt; Nate Agrin and Ken-ichi Ueda continued work on the site with Sean McGregor, a web developer. In 2011, Ueda began collaboration with Scott Loarie, a research fellow at [[Stanford University]] and lecturer at UC Berkeley. Ueda and Loarie are the current co-directors of iNaturalist.org. The organization merged with the [[California Academy of Sciences]] on April 24, 2014.&lt;ref name='merger'&gt;{{cite web|title=California Academy of Sciences Acquires iNaturalist|url=http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2014/inaturalist.php|date=14 May 2014|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, iNaturalist celebrated its one millionth observation.&lt;ref name=Hance2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizen scientist site hits one million observations of life on Earth|first=Jeremy|last= Hance|website=[[Mongabay]]|date=November 10, 2014|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2014/1110-hance-inaturalist-million.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, iNaturalist became a joint initiative between the California Academy of Sciences and the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref name='about20180507'&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/about|date=2018-05-07|accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
The iNaturalist platform is based on [[crowdsourcing]] of data. An iNaturalist observation records an encounter with an individual organism at a particular time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/getting+started|title=Getting Started|last=|first=|date=|website=iNaturalist.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to recording actual audio and photos of the organism, an iNaturalist observation may also record evidence of an organism, such as animal tracks, nests, and scat, but the scope of iNaturalist excludes natural but inert subjects such as [[geology|geologic]] or [[hydrology|hydrologic]] features. Users typically upload photos as evidence of their findings, though audio recordings are also accepted and such evidence is not a strict requirement. Users may share observation locations publicly, "obscure" them to display a less precise location, or make the locations private.

On iNaturalist, other users add identifications to each other’s observations in order to confirm or improve the "community identification." Observations are classified as "casual," "needs ID" (needs identification), or "research grade" based on the quality of the data provided and the community identification process. "Research grade" observations are incorporated into other online databases such as The [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]].&lt;ref name="Bowser et al 2014" /&gt; Users have the option to license their observations, photos, and audio recordings in several ways, including for the [[public domain]], [[Creative Commons]], or with [[all rights reserved]]. 
[[File:Using the iNaturalist app in the field.png|250px|thumb|right|Using the iNaturalist [[mobile app|app]]]]

==Automated species identification==
In addition to observations being identified by others in the community, iNaturalist includes an [[automated species identification]] [[computer vision]] tool, called "Computer Vision."&lt;ref name="compvis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/computer_vision_demo|title=iNaturalist Computer Vision Explorations|last=|first=|date=2017-07-27|website=iNaturalist.org|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images can be identified via an [[artificial intelligence]] model which has been trained on the large database of the "research grade" observations on iNaturalist. A broader taxon such as a [[genus]] or [[family (biology)|family]] is typically provided if the model cannot decide what the species is. If the image has poor lighting, is blurry, or contains multiple subjects, it can be difficult for the model to determine the species and it may decide incorrectly. Multiple species suggestions are typically provided, with the one the software believes the image is most likely of at the top of the list.

==Participation==
{{As of|2018|10|4}}, iNaturalist users contributed over 15,900,000 observations of plants, animals, and other organisms worldwide, with over 88,000 users active in the previous 30 days.&lt;ref name="inatstats"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inaturalist.org/stats|title=iNaturalist.org Stats|last=|first=|date=2018-10-04|website=inaturalist.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; iNaturalist is the preferred application for crowd-sourced biodiversity data in Mexico and southern Africa.&lt;ref name="Pimm et al 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pimm|first1=S.

That project exceeded 100,000 observations in August 2016.&lt;ref name=seltzer2016/&gt; In 2017, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] teamed up with iNaturalist to celebrate [[World Environment Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldenvironmentday.global/en/news/app-brings-marvels-tech-and-nature-together-keep-world-connected|title=App brings marvels of tech and nature together to keep the world connected |website=worldenvironmentday.global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The City Nature Challenge'''

In 2016, Lila Higgins from the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] and Alison Young from the [[California Academy of Sciences]] co-founded the City Nature Challenge. In the first City Nature Challenge, naturalists in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] documented over 20,000 observations with the iNaturalist platform.&lt;ref name='cnc2016'&gt;{{cite web|title=City Nature Challenge 2016 iNaturalist Project|url=https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/city-nature-challenge-2016|date=2018|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the challenge expanded to 16 cities&lt;ref name=cnc2017&gt;{{cite web|title=City Nature Challenge 2017 iNaturalist Project|url=https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/city-nature-challenge-2017-umbrella|date=2018|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the United States and collected over 125,000 observations of wildlife in 5 days. 

In 2018, the challenge expanded to a global audience, with 68 cities participating from 19 countries, with some cities using [[citizen science|community science]] platforms other than iNaturalist to participate.&lt;ref name=cncweb/&gt; In 4 days, over 17,000 people cataloged over 440,000 nature observations in urban regions around the world.&lt;ref name="Higgins2018"&gt;{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Lila|title=City Nature Challenge 2018: A Win For Urban Nature Around the World|website=Natural History Museum, Los Angeles County|date=4 May 2018|url=https://nhm.org/nature/blog/city-nature-challenge-2018-win-urban-nature-around-world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seek for kids/families'''

In spring of 2018, iNaturalist introduced Seek by iNaturalist for iOS mobile devices&lt;ref name="iOS Seek app"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seek by iNaturalist on the App Store|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/seek-by-inaturalist/id1353224144?mt=8|website=App Store|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help children and families learn about nearby nature, try to match a target species, and earn badges for observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seek App - iNaturalist.org|url=https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app|website=iNaturalist.org|accessdate=13 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billed as "kid-safe" and "family-friendly," no registration is required and it collects no user data, meaning observations are not submitted to the iNaturalist database. An Android version is being considered.

{{Information science}}
'''Information seeking''' is the process or activity of attempting to obtain information in both human and technological contexts. Information seeking is related to, but different from, [[information retrieval]] (IR).

== Information retrieval ==
Traditionally, IR tools have been designed for IR professionals to enable them to effectively and efficiently retrieve information from a source. It is assumed that the information exists in the source and that a well-formed query will retrieve it (and nothing else). It has been argued that [[layman|laypersons']] information seeking on the internet is very different from information retrieval as performed within the IR discourse. Yet, internet search engines are built on IR principles. Since the late 1990s a body of research on how casual users interact with internet search engines has been forming, but the topic is far from fully understood. IR can be said to be technology-oriented, focusing on [[algorithm]]s and issues such as [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]] and [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]]. Information seeking may be understood as a more human-oriented and open-ended process than information retrieval. In information seeking, one does not know whether there exists an answer to one's query, so the process of seeking may provide the learning required to satisfy one's [[information need]].

== In different contexts ==
Much library and information science (LIS) research has focused on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = C. M. | last2 = Ortega | first2 = L. | year = 2007 | title = Information seeking behaviour of physical science librarians: Does research inform practice | url = http://crl.acrl.org/content/66/3/231.short | journal = College &amp; Research Libraries | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 231–247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; academics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemminger | first1 = B.

C. | last2 = Tama | first2 = S. L. | year = 2001 | title = Information search process of lawyers: A call for 'just for me' information services | url = | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 25–43 | doi = 10.1108/EUM0000000007076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and mini-publics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Feng|last2=Cai|first2=Guoray|date=2017-06-07|title=Community Issue Review: Crystallizing Knowledge for Encouraging Civic Engagement|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3085228.3085293|publisher=ACM|pages=260–269|doi=10.1145/3085228.3085293|isbn=9781450353175}}&lt;/ref&gt;(among others). Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' information seeking. The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals' information seeking behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to "prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking" (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;188). The model has been adapted by Wilkinson (2001) who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers.

== Theories of information-seeking behavior ==
{{main|Information seeking behavior}}
A variety of theories of information behavior – e.g. [[Zipf]]'s Principle of Least Effort, [[Brenda Dervin]]'s Sense Making, [[Elfreda Chatman]]'s Life in the Round – seek to understand the processes that surround information seeking. In addition, many theories from other disciplines have been applied in investigating an aspect or whole process of information seeking behavior. &lt;ref&gt; Khosrowjerdi, M. 2016. A review of theory-driven models of trust in the online health context. IFLA Journal, 42 (3), 189-206, available http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0340035216659299 &lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the literature on information seeking behavior shows that information seeking has generally been accepted as dynamic and non-linear (Foster, 2005; Kuhlthau 2006). People experience the information search process as an interplay of thoughts, feelings and actions ([[Carol Kuhlthau|Kuhlthau, 2006]]). Donald O. Case (2007) also wrote a good book that is a review of the literature.

Information seeking has been found to be linked to a variety of interpersonal communication behaviors beyond question-asking, to include strategies such as candidate answers.

Robinson’s (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = M. A. | year = 2010 | title = An empirical analysis of engineers' information behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 640–658 | doi = 10.1002/asi.21290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; research suggests that when seeking information at work, people rely on both other people and information repositories (e.g., documents and databases), and spend similar amounts of time consulting each (7.8% and 6.4% of work time, respectively; 14.2% in total). However, the distribution of time among the constituent information seeking stages differs depending on the source. When consulting other people, people spend less time locating the information source and information within that source, similar time understanding the information, and more time problem solving and decision making, than when consulting information repositories. Furthermore, the research found that people spend substantially more time receiving information passively (i.e., information that they have not requested) than actively (i.e., information that they have requested), and this pattern is also reflected when they provide others with information.

== Wilson's nested model of conceptual areas ==
[[Image:Wilsons_Nested_Model_of_Conceptual_Areas.png|thumb|Wilson's Nested Model of Conceptual Areas]]

The concepts of information seeking, information retrieval, and information behaviour are objects of investigation of [[information science]]. Within this scientific discipline a variety of studies has been undertaken analyzing the interaction of an individual with [[information source]]s in case of a specific [[information need]], task, and context. The research models developed in these studies vary in their level of scope. Wilson (1999) therefore developed a nested model of conceptual areas, which visualizes the interrelation of the here mentioned central concepts.

Wilson defines models of information behavior to be "statements, often in the form of diagrams, that attempt to describe an information-seeking activity, the causes and consequences of that activity, or the relationships among stages in information-seeking behaviour" (1999: 250).

The '''Ionospheric Connection Explorer''' ('''''ICON''''')&lt;ref name="icon-ssl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icon.ssl.berkeley.edu |title=Ionospheric Connection Explorer |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a planned satellite designed to investigate changes in the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. ''ICON'' will study the interaction between Earth's weather systems and space weather driven by the Sun, and how this interaction drives turbulence in the upper atmosphere. It is hoped that a better understanding of this dynamic will mitigate its effects on communications, GPS signals, and technology in general.&lt;ref name="icon-ssl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icon-overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/icon-mission-overview |title=ICON Mission Overview |publisher=NASA |accessdate=4 February 2018|date=2016-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of [[NASA]]{{'s}} [[Explorers program]] and will be operated by [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley's]] [[Space Sciences Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2013/04/16/uc-berkeley-selected-to-build-nasas-next-space-weather-satellite/ |title=UC Berkeley selected to build NASA's next space weather satellite |work=Berkeley News |first=Robert |last=Sanders |date=16 April 2013 |access-date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''ICON'' was originally scheduled to launch in December 2017 and has been repeatedly delayed because of problems with its [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus XL]] rocket. Most recently, it was due to launch on 26 October 2018 but the launch was postponed to 7 November 2018.&lt;ref name=postponed/&gt; 

== Overview ==

[[File:The ICON observational geometry, showing both in situ and remote sensing of the ionosphere-thermosphere system.jpg|thumb|left|ICON's observational geometry, showing both in-situ and remote sensing of the ionosphere-thermosphere system.]]
Once launched, ''ICON'' will perform a two-year mission to observe conditions in both the [[thermosphere]] and [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name=selection /&gt; ''ICON'' will be equipped with four instruments: a [[Michelson interferometer]], built by the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]], will measure the winds and temperatures in the thermosphere; an [[ion drift meter]], built by [[University of Texas at Dallas|UT Dallas]], will measure the motion of charged particles in the ionosphere; and two [[ultraviolet]] imagers built at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] will observe the [[airglow]] layers in the upper atmosphere in order to determine both ionospheric and [[Thermosphere|thermospheric]] density and composition.

Many low-Earth orbiting satellites, including the International Space Station, fly through the ionosphere and can be affected by its changing electric and magnetic fields. The ionosphere also acts as a conduit for many communications signals, such as radio waves and the signals that make [[GPS system]]s work. The ionosphere is where [[space weather]] manifests, creating unpredicted conditions such as electric currents that can cause electrical charging of satellites, changing density that can affect satellite orbits, and shifting magnetic fields that can induce current in power systems, causing strain, disrupt communications and navigation or even blackouts.&lt;ref name='Oct Press kit'/&gt; Improved understanding of this environment can help predict such events and improve satellite design.&lt;ref name='Oct Press kit'/&gt;

== Launch planning ==
''ICON'' was originally scheduled to launch in December 2017 and has been repeatedly delayed because of problems with its [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus XL]] rocket. Most recently, it was due to launch on 26 October 2018 but the launch was postponed indefinitely at that time.&lt;ref name=postponed/&gt; In 2017, ICON was going to be launched from [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/10/ngis-updates-icon-launch-status/|title=Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems updates ICON launch status – NASASpaceFlight.com|website=www.nasaspaceflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/11/10/launch-of-nasa-ionospheric-probe-delayed-to-examine-rocket-issue/|title=Launch of NASA ionospheric probe delayed to examine rocket issue – Spaceflight Now|website=spaceflightnow.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When that was launch was scrubbed, it was possible it to ferry the launch vehicle using the air-launch aircraft ''Stargazer'' back the United States where a new launch site was chosen, Cape Canaveral in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/10/ngis-updates-icon-launch-status/|title=Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems updates ICON launch status – NASASpaceFlight.com|website=www.nasaspaceflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The October 2018 launch was to be from Cape Canaveral, Florida before issues were detected with some new components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/10/ngis-updates-icon-launch-status/|title=Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems updates ICON launch status – NASASpaceFlight.com|website=www.nasaspaceflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the delay in 2017 had to due concerns over the rocket-aircraft separation system;the launch system has a good track record launching small science payloads for NASA, and just had a successful launched in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/11/10/launch-of-nasa-ionospheric-probe-delayed-to-examine-rocket-issue/|title=Launch of NASA ionospheric probe delayed to examine rocket issue – Spaceflight Now|website=spaceflightnow.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch system has placed more than 80 satellites in low orbit since its first in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/pegasus-celebrates-quarter-century-milestone/|title=Pegasus celebrates quarter of a century milestone – NASASpaceFlight.com|website=www.nasaspaceflight.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], '''Kepler's laws of planetary motion''' are three [[scientific law]]s describing the motion of [[planet]]s around the [[Sun]].

#The [[orbit]] of a planet is an [[ellipse]] with the Sun at one of the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]].
#A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.&lt;ref name="Wolfram2nd"&gt;Bryant, Jeff; Pavlyk, Oleksandr. "[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/KeplersSecondLaw/ Kepler's Second Law]", ''[[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]]''. Retrieved December 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The square of the [[orbital period]] of a planet is proportional to the cube of the [[semi-major axis]] of its orbit.

Most planetary orbits are nearly circular, and careful observation and calculation are required in order to establish that they are not perfectly circular. Calculations of the orbit of [[Mars]], whose published values are somewhat suspect,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/science/after-400-years-a-challenge-to-kepler-he-fabricated-his-data-scholar-says.html?pagewanted=1&lt;/ref&gt; indicated an elliptical orbit. From this, [[Johannes Kepler]] inferred that other bodies in the [[Solar System]], including those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits.

Kepler's work (published between 1609 and 1619) improved the [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], explaining how the planets' speeds varied, and using elliptical orbits rather than circular orbits with [[epicycle]]s.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the Solar System to a good approximation, as a consequence of his own [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]].

==Comparison to Copernicus==
Kepler's laws improved the model of Copernicus. If the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricities]] of the planetary [[orbit]]s are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agreed with Copernicus:
#The planetary orbit is a circle
#The Sun is at the center of the orbit
#The speed of the planet in the orbit is constant

The eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the foregoing rules give fair approximations of planetary motion, but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than does the model proposed by Copernicus.

Kepler's corrections are not at all obvious:
#The planetary orbit is ''not'' a circle, but an ''ellipse''.
#The Sun is ''not'' at the center but at a ''focal point'' of the elliptical orbit.
#Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the ''area speed'' is constant.

The eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the [[March equinox]] to the [[September equinox]], around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the Sun parallel to the [[equator]] of the Earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;e \approx \frac{\pi}{4} \frac{186 - 179}{186 + 179} \approx 0.015,&lt;/math&gt;

which is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see [[Earth's orbit]]).

The calculation is correct when [[perihelion]], the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a [[solstice]]. The current perihelion, near January 3, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21 or 22.

==Nomenclature==
It took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to take on its settled form. [[Voltaire]]'s ''Eléments de la philosophie de Newton'' (Elements of Newton's Philosophy) of 1738 was the first publication to use the terminology of "laws".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, ''Eléments de la philosophie de Newton'' [Elements of Newton's Philosophy] (London, England: 1738).  See, for example:

(By one of the great laws of Kepler, each planet describes equal areas in equal times ; by another law no less certain, each planet makes its revolution around the sun in such a way that if its mean distance from the sun is 10, take the cube of that number, which will be 1000, and the time of the revolution of that planet around the sun will be proportional to the square root of that number 1000.)

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers]]'' in its article on Kepler (p.&amp;nbsp;620) states that the terminology of scientific laws for these discoveries was current at least from the time of [[Joseph de Lalande]].&lt;ref&gt;De la Lande, ''Astronomie'', vol. 1 (Paris, France:  Desaint &amp; Saillant, 1764).  See, for example:
*  [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=Sg8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA390 From page 390:]  ''" … mais suivant la fameuse loi de Kepler, qui sera expliquée dans le Livre suivant (892), le rapport des temps périodiques est toujours plus grand que celui des distances, une planete cinq fois plus éloignée du soleil, emploie à faire sa révolution douze fois plus de temps ou environ; … "'' ( … but according to the famous law of Kepler, which will be explained in the following book [i.e., chapter] (paragraph 892), the ratio of the periods is always greater than that of the distances [so that, for example,] a planet five times farther from the sun, requires about twelve times or so more time to make its revolution [around the sun]; … )

Mawman, 1804).&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the current usage of "Kepler's Second Law" is something of a misnomer. Kepler had two versions, related in a qualitative sense: the "distance law" and the "area law". The "area law" is what became the Second Law in the set of three; but Kepler did himself not privilege it in that way.&lt;ref name="Stephenson1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Stephenson|title=Kepler's Physical Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pxCYAeOqJg8C&amp;pg=PA170|date=1994|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0-691-03652-7|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Johannes Kepler]] published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of [[Tycho Brahe]].&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Astronomia nova'', Kepler presented only a proof that Mars' orbit is elliptical.  Evidence that the other known planets' orbits are elliptical was presented only in 1621.&lt;br&gt;
See:  Johannes Kepler, ''Astronomia nova'' … (1609), [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up p. 285.]  After having rejected circular and oval orbits, Kepler concluded that Mars' orbit must be elliptical.  From the top of page 285:  ''"Ergo ellipsis est Planetæ iter; … "'' (Thus, an ellipse is the planet's [i.e., Mars'] path; … )  Later on the same page:  ''" … ut sequenti capite patescet:  ubi simul etiam demonstrabitur, nullam Planetæ relinqui figuram Orbitæ, præterquam perfecte ellipticam; … "'' ( … as will be revealed in the next chapter:  where it will also then be proved that any figure of the planet's orbit must be relinquished, except a perfect ellipse; … )  And then:  ''"Caput LIX.  Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … "'' (Chapter 59.  Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … )  The geometric proof that Mars' orbit is an ellipse appears as Protheorema XI on pages 289–290.&lt;br&gt;
Kepler stated that every planet travels in elliptical orbits having the Sun at one focus in:  Johannes Kepler,  ''Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae'' [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz ("Lentiis ad Danubium"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, part 1, III.  De Figura Orbitæ (III.  On the figure [i.e., shape] of orbits), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&amp;pg=PA658 pages 658–665.]  From p. 658:  ''"Ellipsin fieri orbitam planetæ … "'' (Of an ellipse is made a planet's orbit … ).  From p. 659:  ''" … Sole (Foco altero huius ellipsis) … "'' ( … the Sun (the other focus of this ellipse) … ).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite book

|location=Piscataway, NJ |accessdate=December 27, 2009 |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Astronomia nova'' ... (1609), Kepler did not present his second law in its modern form.  He did that only in his ''Epitome'' of 1621.  Furthermore, in 1609, he presented his second law in two different forms, which scholars call the "distance law" and the "area law".
*  His "distance law" is presented in:  ''"Caput XXXII.  Virtutem quam Planetam movet in circulum attenuari cum discessu a fonte."'' (Chapter 32.  The force that moves a planet circularly weakens with distance from the source.)  See:  Johannes Kepler, ''Astronomia nova'' … (1609), [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/164/mode/2up pp. 165–167.]  [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/166/mode/2up On page 167], Kepler states:  ''" … , quanto longior est αδ quam αε, tanto diutius moratur Planeta in certo aliquo arcui excentrici apud δ, quam in æquali arcu excentrici apud ε."'' ( … , as αδ is longer than αε, so much longer will a planet remain on a certain arc of the eccentric near δ than on an equal arc of the eccentric near ε.)  That is, the farther a planet is from the Sun (at the point α), the slower it moves along its orbit, so a radius from the Sun to a planet passes through equal areas in equal times.  However, as Kepler presented it, his argument is accurate only for circles, not ellipses.
*  His "area law" is presented in:  ''"Caput LIX.  Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … "'' (Chapter 59.  Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … ), Protheorema XIV and XV, [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up pp. 291–295.]  On the top p. 294, it reads:   ''"Arcum ellipseos, cujus moras metitur area AKN, debere terminari in LK, ut sit AM."''  (The arc of the ellipse, of which the duration is delimited [i.e., measured] by the area AKM, should be terminated in LK, so that it [i.e., the arc] is AM.)  In other words, the time that Mars requires to move along an arc AM of its elliptical orbit is measured by the area of the segment AMN of the ellipse (where N is the position of the Sun), which in turn is proportional to the section AKN of the circle that encircles the ellipse and that is tangent to it.  Therefore, the area that is swept out by a radius from the Sun to Mars as Mars moves along an arc of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the time that Mars requires to move along that arc.  Thus, a radius from the Sun to Mars sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

In 1621, Kepler restated his second law for any planet:  Johannes Kepler, ''Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae'' [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz ("Lentiis ad Danubium"), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&amp;pg=PA668 page 668].  From page 668:  ''"Dictum quidem est in superioribus, divisa orbita in particulas minutissimas æquales:  accrescete iis moras planetæ per eas, in proportione intervallorum inter eas &amp; Solem."''  (It has been said above that, if the orbit of the planet is divided into the smallest equal parts, the times of the planet in them increase in the ratio of the distances between them and the sun.)  That is, a planet's speed along its orbit is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun.  (The remainder of the paragraph makes clear that Kepler was referring to what is now called angular velocity.)&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler's third law was published in 1619.&lt;ref name = "Kepler 1619"&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''Harmonices Mundi'' [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1619), book 5, chapter 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLlCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA189 p. 189.]  From the bottom of p. 189:  ''"Sed res est certissima exactissimaque quod ''proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit præcise sesquialtera proportionis'' mediarum distantiarum, … "''  (But it is absolutely certain and exact that the ''proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the sesquialternate proportion'' [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, … ")&lt;br&gt;
An English translation of Kepler's ''Harmonices Mundi'' is available as:  Johannes Kepler with E.J. Aiton, A.M. Duncan, and J.V. Field, trans., ''The Harmony of the World'' (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:  American Philosophical Society, 1997); see especially [https://books.google.com/books?id=rEkLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA411 p. 411].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holton /&gt; Kepler had believed in the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] of the solar system, which called for circular orbits, but he could not reconcile Brahe's highly precise observations with a circular fit to Mars' orbit—Mars coincidentally having the highest eccentricity of all planets except Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.windows2universe.org/?page=/our_solar_system/planets_table.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first law reflected this discovery.

Kepler in 1621 and [[Godefroy Wendelin]] in 1643 noted that Kepler's third law applies to the four brightest moons of [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref group="Nb"&gt;Godefroy Wendelin wrote a letter to Giovanni Battista Riccioli about the relationship between the distances of the Jovian moons from Jupiter and the periods of their orbits, showing that the periods and distances conformed to Kepler's third law.  See:  Joanne Baptista Riccioli, ''Almagestum novum'' … (Bologna (Bononia), (Italy):  Victor Benati, 1651), volume 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mJDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA492 page 492 Scholia III.]  In the margin beside the relevant paragraph is printed: ''Vendelini ingeniosa speculatio circa motus &amp; intervalla satellitum Jovis''.  (Wendelin's clever speculation about the movement and distances of Jupiter's satellites.)&lt;br&gt;In 1621, Johannes Kepler had noted that Jupiter's moons obey (approximately) his third law in his ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'' [Epitome of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (“Lentiis ad Danubium“), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&amp;pg=PA554 page 554].&lt;/ref&gt; The second law, in the "area law" form, was contested by [[Nicolaus Mercator]] in a book from 1664, but by 1670 his ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' were in its favour. As the century proceeded it became more widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilbur Applebaum|title=Encyclopedia of the Scientific Revolution: From Copernicus to Newton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k43Q9RHuGXgC&amp;pg=PT603|date=13 June 2000|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-135-58255-5|page=603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception in Germany changed noticeably between 1688, the year in which Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was published and was taken to be basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] on Kepler had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Roy Porter]]|title=The Scientific Revolution in National Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l61fl6Z1sxQC&amp;pg=PA102|date=25 September 1992|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-39699-8|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton was credited with understanding that the second law is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation, being a consequence just of the radial nature of that law; while the other laws do depend on the inverse square form of the attraction. [[Carl Runge]] and [[Wilhelm Lenz]] much later identified a symmetry principle in the [[phase space]] of planetary motion (the [[orthogonal group]] O(4) acting) which accounts for the first and third laws in the case of Newtonian gravitation, as [[conservation of angular momentum]] does via rotational symmetry for the second law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victor Guillemin|author2=Shlomo Sternberg|title=Variations on a Theme by Kepler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NXFth0gDQgC&amp;pg=PR5|date=2006|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-4184-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulary==
The mathematical model of the kinematics of a planet subject to the laws allows a large range of further calculations.

===First law of Kepler===
{{bq|The [[orbit]] of every [[planet]] is an [[ellipse]] with the Sun at one of the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]].}}

[[File:kepler-first-law.svg|thumb|Figure 2: Kepler's first law placing the Sun at the focus of an elliptical orbit]]

[[File:Ellipse latus rectum.svg|thumb|Figure 4: Heliocentric coordinate system (''r'',{{nbsp}}''θ'') for ellipse. Also shown are: semi-major axis ''a'', semi-minor axis ''b'' and semi-latus rectum ''p''; center of ellipse and its two foci marked by large dots. For {{nowrap|θ {{=}} 0°}}, {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''r''{{sub|min}}}} and for {{nowrap|θ {{=}} 180°}}, {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''r''{{sub|max}}}}.]]

Mathematically, an ellipse can be represented by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon\, \cos\theta},&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[semi-latus rectum]], ''ε'' is the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the ellipse, ''r'' is the distance from the Sun to the planet, and ''θ'' is the angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as seen from the Sun. So (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'') are [[polar coordinates]].

For an ellipse 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''ε''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 ; in the limiting case ''ε'' = 0, the orbit is a circle with the sun at the centre (i.e. where there is zero eccentricity).

At ''θ'' = 0°, [[perihelion]], the distance is minimum
:&lt;math&gt;r_\min = \frac{p}{1 + \varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

At ''θ'' = 90° and at ''θ'' = 270° the distance is equal to &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

At ''θ'' = 180°, [[aphelion]],  the distance is maximum (by definition, aphelion is – invariably – perihelion plus 180°)
:&lt;math&gt;r_\max = \frac{p}{1 - \varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[semi-major axis]] ''a'' is the [[arithmetic mean]] between ''r''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  r_\max - a &amp;= a - r_\min \\[3pt]
           a &amp;= \frac{p}{1 - \varepsilon^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[semi-minor axis]] ''b'' is the [[geometric mean]] between ''r''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{r_\max}{b} &amp;= \frac{b}{r_\min} \\[3pt]
                 b &amp;= \frac{p}{\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[semi-latus rectum]] ''p'' is the [[harmonic mean]] between ''r''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{r_\min} - \frac{1}{p} &amp;= \frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{r_\max} \\[3pt]
                              pa &amp;= r_\max r_\min = b^2\,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] ''&amp;epsilon;'' is the [[coefficient of variation]] between ''r''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \frac{r_\max - r_\min}{r_\max + r_\min}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[area]] of the ellipse is
:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi a b\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The special case of a circle is ''ε'' = 0, resulting in ''r'' = ''p'' =  ''r''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' = ''b'' and ''A'' = ''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Second law of Kepler===
{{bq|A [[line (geometry)|line]] joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.&lt;ref name="Wolfram2nd"/&gt;}}

[[File:kepler-second-law.gif|thumb|The same (blue) area is swept out in a fixed time period. The green arrow is velocity. The purple arrow directed towards the Sun is the acceleration. The other two purple arrows are acceleration components parallel and perpendicular to the velocity.]]

The orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet in the elliptical orbit will vary. This is shown in the animation: the planet travels faster when closer to the sun, then slower when farther from the sun. Kepler's second law states that the blue sector has constant area.

In a small time &lt;math&gt;dt\,&lt;/math&gt; the planet sweeps out a small triangle having base line &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;r \, d\theta&lt;/math&gt; and area &lt;math&gt;dA = \frac{1}{2} \cdot r \cdot rd\theta&lt;/math&gt; and so the constant [[areal velocity]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{1}{2}r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

The area enclosed by the elliptical orbit is &lt;math&gt;\pi ab.\,&lt;/math&gt; So the period &lt;math&gt;P\,&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;P \cdot \frac{1}{2}r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \pi ab&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[mean motion]] of the planet around the Sun
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{2\pi}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;r^2\,d\theta = abn\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

===Third law of Kepler ===
&lt;!--- The article Gravitation links to this subsection. Please do not change the title of this subsection without making the appropriate amendments to all articles that link to it ---&gt;
{{bq|The [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[orbital period]] of a planet is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[cube (arithmetic)|cube]] of the [[semi-major axis]] of its orbit.}}

This captures the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods.

Kepler enunciated in 1619&lt;ref name = "Kepler 1619"/&gt; this third law in a laborious attempt to determine what he viewed as the "[[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]" according to precise laws, and express it in terms of musical notation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Arthur Burtt|Burtt, Edwin]]. ''The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science''. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;
So it was known as the ''harmonic law''.&lt;ref name=Holton3&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics, the Human Adventure |author=Gerald James Holton, Stephen G. Brush |page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=czaGZzR0XOUC&amp;pg=PA45|isbn=0-8135-2908-5 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using Newton's Law of gravitation (published 1687), this relation can be found in the case of a circular orbit by setting the [[centripetal force]] equal to the gravitational force:
: &lt;math&gt;mr\omega^2 = G\frac{mM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, expressing the angular velocity in terms of the orbital period and then rearranging, we find Kepler's Third Law:
: &lt;math&gt;mr\left(\frac{2\pi}{T}\right)^2 = G\frac{mM}{r^2} \rightarrow T^2 = \left(\frac{4\pi^2}{GM} \right)r^3 \rightarrow  T^2 \propto r^3&lt;/math&gt;

A more detailed derivation can be done with general elliptical orbits, instead of circles, as well as orbiting the center of mass, instead of just the large mass. This results in replacing a circular radius, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, with the elliptical semi-major axis, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, as well as replacing the large mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;M + m&lt;/math&gt;. However, with planet masses being so much smaller than the sun, this correction is often ignored. The full corresponding formula is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^3}{T^2} = \frac{G(M + m)}{4\pi^2} \approx \frac{GM}{4\pi^2} \approx 7.495 \cdot 10^{-6} \left(\frac{\text{AU}^3}{\text{days}^2}\right) \text{ is constant}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the sun, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the planet, and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital period and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the elliptical semi-major axis.

==Planetary acceleration==
[[Isaac Newton]] computed in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' the [[acceleration]] of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second law.
# The ''direction'' of the acceleration is towards the Sun.
# The ''magnitude'' of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance from the Sun (the ''inverse square law'').

This implies that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of planets. However, Newton states in his Principia that he considers forces from a mathematical point of view, not a physical, thereby taking an instrumentalist view.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, Principia, p. 408 in the translation of I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he does not assign a cause to gravity.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, Principia, p. 943 in the translation of I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton defined the [[force]] acting on a planet to be the product of its [[mass]] and the acceleration (see [[Newton's laws of motion]]). So:
# Every planet is attracted towards the Sun.
# The force acting on a planet is directly proportional to the mass of the planet and is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the Sun.

The Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed, in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]:
# All bodies in the solar system attract one another.
# The force between two bodies is in direct proportion to the product of their masses and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them.

As the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits conform approximately to Kepler's laws. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's model, and fits actual observations more accurately (see [[two-body problem]]).

Below comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second laws.

===Acceleration vector===
{{See also| Polar coordinate#Vector calculus| Mechanics of planar particle motion}}
From the [[heliocentric]] point of view consider the vector to the planet &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r\hat{\mathbf{r}} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the planet and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[unit vector]] pointing towards the planet. 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{dt} = \dot{\hat{\mathbf{r}}} = \dot{\theta}\hat{\boldsymbol\theta},\qquad
  \frac{d\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}}{dt} = \dot{\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}} = -\dot{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector whose direction is 90 degrees counterclockwise of &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the polar angle, and where a [[Notation for differentiation#Newton.27s notation|dot]] on top of the variable signifies differentiation with respect to time.

Differentiate the position vector twice to obtain the velocity vector and the acceleration vector:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \dot{\mathbf{r}} &amp;= \dot{r}\hat{\mathbf{r}} + r\dot{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}
                     = \dot{r}\hat{\mathbf{r}} + r\dot{\theta}\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}, \\
  \ddot{\mathbf{r}} &amp;= \left(\ddot{r}\hat{\mathbf{r}}
                             + \dot{r}\dot{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}
                       \right)
                       + \left(\dot{r}\dot{\theta} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}
                               + r\ddot{\theta}\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}
                               + r\dot{\theta}\dot{\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}
                         \right)
                    = \left(\ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2\right)\hat{\mathbf{r}}
                      + \left(r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}\right)\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{\mathbf{r}} = a_r \hat{\boldsymbol{r}}+a_\theta\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

where the '''radial acceleration''' is
:&lt;math&gt;a_r = \ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the '''transversal acceleration''' is
:&lt;math&gt;a_\theta = r\ddot{\theta} + 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverse square law===
Kepler's second law says that
:&lt;math&gt;r^2\dot{\theta} = nab&lt;/math&gt; 

is constant.

The transversal acceleration &lt;math&gt;a_\theta&lt;/math&gt; is zero:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left(r^2\dot{\theta}\right)}{dt}
  = r\left(2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r{\ddot{\theta}}\right)
  = ra_\theta = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

So the acceleration of a planet obeying Kepler's second law is directed towards the sun.

The radial acceleration &lt;math&gt;a_\text{r}&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;a_\text{r}
  = \ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2
  = \ddot{r} - r\left(\frac{nab}{r^2}\right)^2
  = \ddot{r} - \frac{n^2 a^2 b^2}{r^3}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Kepler's first law states that the orbit is described by the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{r} = 1 + \varepsilon\cos(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to time
:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{p\dot{r}}{r^2} = -\varepsilon\sin(\theta)\,\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;p\dot{r} = nab\,\varepsilon\sin(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating once more
:&lt;math&gt;p\ddot{r}
  = nab\varepsilon\cos(\theta)\, \dot{\theta}
  = nab\varepsilon\cos(\theta)\, \frac{nab}{r^2}
  = \frac{n^2 a^2 b^2}{r^2}\varepsilon\cos(\theta).
&lt;/math&gt;

The radial acceleration &lt;math&gt;a_\text{r}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;pa_\text{r}
  = \frac{n^2 a^2 b^2}{r^2}\varepsilon\cos(\theta) - p\frac{n^2 a^2 b^2}{r^3}
  = \frac{n^2 a^2 b^2}{r^2}\left(\varepsilon\cos(\theta) - \frac{p}{r}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the equation of the ellipse gives
:&lt;math&gt;pa_\text{r} = \frac{n^2 a^2 b^2}{r^2}\left(\frac{p}{r} - 1 - \frac{p}{r}\right) = -\frac{n^2 a^2}{r^2}b^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The relation &lt;math&gt;b^2 = pa&lt;/math&gt; gives the simple final result
:&lt;math&gt;a_\text{r} = -\frac{n^2 a^3}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the acceleration vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{r}}&lt;/math&gt; of any planet obeying Kepler's first and second law satisfies the '''inverse square law'''
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{r}} = -\frac{\alpha}{r^2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = n^2 a^3\,&lt;/math&gt;

is a constant, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector pointing from the Sun towards the planet, and &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the planet and the Sun.

According to Kepler's third law, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has the same value for all the planets. So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire solar system.

The inverse square law is a [[differential equation]]. The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a [[hyperbola]] or [[parabola]] or a [[straight line]]. See [[Kepler orbit]].

===Newton's law of gravitation===
By [[Newton's second law]], the gravitational force that acts on the planet is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m_\text{planet} \mathbf{\ddot{r}} = - m_\text{planet} \alpha r^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_\text{planet}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the planet and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has the same value for all planets in the solar system. According to [[Newton's Third Law|Newton's third Law]], the Sun is attracted to the planet by a force of the same magnitude. Since the force is proportional to the mass of the planet, under the symmetric consideration, it should also be proportional to the mass of the Sun, &lt;math&gt;m_\text{Sun}&lt;/math&gt;. So
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = Gm_\text{Sun}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]].

The acceleration of solar system body number ''i'' is, according to Newton's laws:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_i = G\sum_{j \ne i} m_j r_{ij}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_j &lt;/math&gt; is the mass of body ''j'', &lt;math&gt;r_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; is the distance between body ''i'' and body ''j'', &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector from body ''i'' towards body ''j'', and the vector summation is over all bodies in the world, besides ''i'' itself.

In the special case where there are only two bodies in the world, Earth and Sun, the acceleration becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_\text{Earth} = Gm_\text{Sun} r_{\text{Earth},\text{Sun}}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{Earth},\text{Sun}}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the acceleration of the Kepler motion. So this Earth moves around the Sun according to Kepler's laws.

If the two bodies in the world are Moon and Earth the acceleration of the Moon becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot{r}}_\text{Moon} = Gm_\text{Earth} r_{\text{Moon},\text{Earth}}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{Moon},\text{Earth}}&lt;/math&gt;

So in this approximation the Moon moves around the Earth according to Kepler's laws.

In the three-body case the accelerations are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_\text{Sun} &amp;=
      Gm_\text{Earth} r_{\text{Sun},\text{Earth}}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{Sun},\text{Earth}} +
      Gm_\text{Moon} r_{\text{Sun},\text{Moon}}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{Sun},\text{Moon}} \\
  \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_\text{Earth} &amp;=
      Gm_\text{Sun} r_{\text{Earth},\text{Sun}}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{Earth},\text{Sun}} +
      Gm_\text{Moon} r_{\text{Earth},\text{Moon}}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{Earth},\text{Moon}} \\
   \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_\text{Moon} &amp;=
      Gm_\text{Sun} r_{\text{Moon},\text{Sun}}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{Moon},\text{Sun}} +
      Gm_\text{Earth} r_{\text{Moon},\text{Earth}}^{-2} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\text{Moon},\text{Earth}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These accelerations are not those of Kepler orbits, and the [[three-body problem]] is complicated. But Keplerian approximation is the basis for [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]] calculations. See [[Lunar theory]].

==Position as a function of time {{anchor|position_function_time}}==
Kepler used his two first laws to compute the position of a planet as a function of time. His method involves the solution of a [[Transcendental function|transcendental equation]] called [[Kepler's equation]].

The procedure for calculating the heliocentric polar coordinates (''r'',''θ'') of a planet as a function of the time ''t'' since [[perihelion]], is the following four steps:

# Compute the '''[[mean anomaly]]''' ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''nt'' where ''n'' is the [[mean motion]].
#: &lt;math&gt;n\cdot P = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; radians where ''P'' is the period.
# Compute the '''[[eccentric anomaly]]''' ''E'' by solving Kepler's equation:
#: &lt;math&gt;M = E - \varepsilon\sin E&lt;/math&gt;
# Compute the '''[[true anomaly]]''' ''&amp;theta;'' by the equation:
#: &lt;math&gt;(1 - \varepsilon) \tan^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = (1 + \varepsilon)\tan^2\frac{E}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
# Compute the '''heliocentric distance'''
#: &lt;math&gt;r = a(1 - \varepsilon\cos E). &lt;/math&gt;

The Cartesian velocity vector can along be trivially calculated as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \frac{\sqrt{\mu a}}{r} \left\langle -\sin{E}, \sqrt{1-\varepsilon^2} \cos{E}\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwarz|first1=René|title=Memorandum № 1: Keplerian Orbit Elements → Cartesian State Vectors|url=https://downloads.rene-schwarz.com/download/M001-Keplerian_Orbit_Elements_to_Cartesian_State_Vectors.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important special case of circular orbit, ''ε''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, gives ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''M''. Because the uniform circular motion was considered to be ''normal'', a deviation from this motion was considered an '''anomaly'''.

The proof of this procedure is shown below.

===Mean anomaly, ''M''===
[[File:Mean Anomaly.svg|thumb|200px| FIgure 5: Geometric construction for Kepler's calculation of θ. The Sun (located at the focus) is labeled ''S'' and the planet ''P''. The auxiliary circle is an aid to calculation. Line ''xd'' is perpendicular to the base and through the planet ''P''. The shaded sectors are arranged to have equal areas by positioning of point ''y''.]]
The Keplerian problem assumes an [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]] and the four points:
: ''s'' the Sun (at one focus of ellipse);
: ''z'' the [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]]
: ''c'' the center of the ellipse
: ''p'' the planet
and
: &lt;math&gt;\ a = |cz|,&lt;/math&gt; distance between center and perihelion, the '''semimajor axis''',
: &lt;math&gt;\ \varepsilon = {|cs| \over a},&lt;/math&gt; the '''eccentricity''',
: &lt;math&gt;\ b = a\sqrt{1 - \varepsilon^2},&lt;/math&gt; the '''semiminor axis''',
: &lt;math&gt;\ r = |sp| ,&lt;/math&gt; the distance between Sun and planet.
: &lt;math&gt;\theta = \angle zsp,&lt;/math&gt; the direction to the planet as seen from the Sun, the '''[[true anomaly]]'''.

The problem is to compute the [[polar coordinates]] (''r'',''θ'') of the planet from the '''time since perihelion''',&amp;nbsp;''t''.

It is solved in steps. Kepler considered the circle with the major axis as a diameter, and
:&lt;math&gt;\ x,&lt;/math&gt; the projection of the planet to the auxiliary circle
:&lt;math&gt;\ y,&lt;/math&gt; the point on the circle such that the sector areas |''zcy''| and |''zsx''| are equal,
:&lt;math&gt;M = \angle zcy,&lt;/math&gt; the '''[[mean anomaly]]'''.

The sector areas are related by &lt;math&gt;|zsp| = \frac{b}{a} \cdot |zsx|.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[circular sector]] area &lt;math&gt;|zcy| = \frac{a^2 M}2.&lt;/math&gt;

The area swept since perihelion, 
: &lt;math&gt;|zsp| = \frac{b}{a} \cdot|zsx| = \frac{b}{a} \cdot |zcy| = \frac{b}{a} \cdot \frac{a^2 M}{2} = \frac{abM}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

is by Kepler's second law proportional to time since perihelion. So the mean anomaly, ''M'', is proportional to time since perihelion, ''t''.
: &lt;math&gt;M = nt,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the [[mean motion]].

===Eccentric anomaly, ''E''===
When the mean anomaly ''M'' is computed, the goal is to compute the true anomaly ''θ''. The function ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''M'') is, however, not elementary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.ifpan.edu.pl/firststep/aw-works/fsII/mul/mueller.html|title=EQUATION OF TIME – PROBLEM IN ASTRONOMY|last=MÜLLER|first=M|date=1995|publisher=Acta Physica Polonica A|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler's solution is to use
: &lt;math&gt;E = \angle zcx&lt;/math&gt;, ''x'' as seen from the centre,  the '''[[eccentric anomaly]]'''
as an intermediate variable, and first compute ''E'' as a function of ''M'' by solving Kepler's equation below, and then compute the true anomaly ''θ'' from the eccentric anomaly ''E''. Here are the details.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
            |zcy| &amp;= |zsx| = |zcx| - |scx| \\
  \frac{a^2 M}{2} &amp;= \frac{a^2 E}2 - \frac{a\varepsilon \cdot a\sin E}{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Division by ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 gives '''[[Kepler's equation]]'''
:&lt;math&gt;M = E - \varepsilon\sin E.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation gives ''M'' as a function of ''E''. Determining ''E'' for a given ''M'' is the inverse problem. Iterative numerical algorithms are commonly used.

Having computed the eccentric anomaly ''E'', the next step is to calculate the true anomaly&amp;nbsp;''θ''.

===True anomaly, ''θ''===
Note from the figure that
:&lt;math&gt;\overrightarrow{cd} = \overrightarrow{cs} + \overrightarrow{sd}&lt;/math&gt;

so that
:&lt;math&gt;a\cos E = a \varepsilon + r\cos\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and inserting from Kepler's first law
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{r}{a} = \frac{1 - \varepsilon^2}{1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

to get
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cos E = \varepsilon + \frac{1 - \varepsilon^2}{1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta} \cos\theta
         = \frac{\varepsilon (1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta) + \left(1 - \varepsilon^2\right)\cos\theta}{1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta}
         = \frac{\varepsilon + \cos\theta}{1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The result is a usable relationship between the eccentric anomaly ''E'' and the true anomaly&amp;nbsp;''θ''.

A computationally more convenient form follows by substituting into the [[trigonometric identity]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan^2\frac{x}{2} = \frac{1 - \cos x}{1 + \cos x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \tan^2\frac{E}{2}
    &amp;= \frac{1 - \cos E}{1 + \cos E}
     = \frac{1 - \frac{\varepsilon + \cos\theta}{1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta}}{1 + \frac{\varepsilon + \cos \theta}{1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta}} \\[8pt]
    &amp;= \frac{(1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta) - (\varepsilon + \cos\theta)}{(1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta) + (\varepsilon + \cos\theta)}
    = \frac{1 - \varepsilon}{1 + \varepsilon} \cdot \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{1 + \cos\theta}
    = \frac{1 - \varepsilon}{1 + \varepsilon} \tan^2\frac{\theta}{2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ε'' gives the result
:&lt;math&gt;(1 - \varepsilon)\tan^2\frac{\theta}{2} = (1 + \varepsilon)\tan^2\frac{E}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the third step in the connection between time and position in the orbit.

=== Distance, ''r'' ===
The fourth step is to compute the heliocentric distance ''r'' from the true anomaly ''θ'' by Kepler's first law:
:&lt;math&gt;r(1 + \varepsilon\cos\theta) = a\left(1 - \varepsilon^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the relation above between ''θ'' and ''E'' the final equation for the distance ''r'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;r = a(1 - \varepsilon\cos E).&lt;/math&gt;

*(1.) ID - The X-15 program used a 3-digit ID code to record information. 
**The first digit represents the specific X-15 flown. 1 = X-15-1, 2 = X-15-2 or X-15-2A, 3 = X-15-3. 
**The second digit represents the number of the specific X-15. This is for free flights only. Captive flights used a "C" in the second position. If a free flight resulted in an aborted launch, the second digit was represented by an "A".
**The third digit represents the total number of times that specific X-15 had been carried aloft by either NB-52. This number incremented for each captive-carry, abort, and actual release.

Only X-15 free flights are shown on the above list.

'''Little Joe 5B''' was an unmanned [[Launch escape system|Launch Escape System]] test of the Mercury spacecraft, conducted as part of the US [[Mercury program]].  The mission used production Mercury spacecraft # 14A. The mission was launched April 28, 1961, from [[Wallops Island]], [[Virginia]].  The Little Joe 5B flew to an apogee of 2.8 miles (4.5&amp;nbsp;km) and a range of 9 miles (14&amp;nbsp;km).  The mission lasted 5 minutes 25 seconds. Maximum speed was 1,780&amp;nbsp;mph (2865&amp;nbsp;km/h) and acceleration was 10 g (98&amp;nbsp;m/s²).  The mission was a success and Mercury spacecraft # 14A was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4201/ch10-9.htm |title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury - NASA SP-4201 |authors=Loyd S.

'''Loop modeling''' is a problem in [[protein structure prediction]] requiring the prediction of the [[chemical conformation|conformations]] of [[loop (biochemistry)|loop]] regions in [[protein]]s with or without the use of a structural template. Computer programs that solve these problems have been used to research a broad range of scientific topics from [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] to [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perraud|first=AL |author2=Takanishi, CL |author3=Shen, B |author4=Kang, S |author5=Smith, MK |author6=Schmitz, C |author7=Knowles, HM |author8=Ferraris, D |author9=Li, W |author10=Zhang, J |author11=Stoddard, BL |author12=Scharenberg, AM|title=Accumulation of free ADP-ribose from mitochondria mediates oxidative stress-induced gating of TRPM2 cation channels.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Feb 18, 2005|volume=280|issue=7|pages=6138–48|pmid=15561722|doi=10.1074/jbc.M411446200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baloria|first=U|author2=Akhoon, BA |author3=Gupta, SK |author4=Sharma, S |author5= Verma, V |title=In silico proteomic characterization of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) for the mapping of high affinity antigenic determinants against breast cancer.|journal=Amino Acids|date=Apr 2012|volume=42|issue=4|pages=1349–60|pmid=21229277|doi=10.1007/s00726-010-0830-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because protein function is determined by its shape and the physiochemical properties of its exposed surface, it is important to create an accurate model for protein/ligand interaction studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fiser|first=A|author2=Sali, A |title=ModLoop: automated modeling of loops in protein structures.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=Dec 12, 2003|volume=19|issue=18|pages=2500–1|pmid=14668246|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem arises often in [[homology modeling]], where the [[tertiary structure]] of an [[amino acid sequence]] is predicted based on a [[sequence alignment]] to a ''template'', or a second sequence whose structure is known. Because loops have highly variable sequences even within a given [[structural motif]] or [[protein folding|protein fold]], they often correspond to unaligned regions in sequence alignments; they also tend to be located at the [[solvent]]-exposed surface of [[globular protein]]s and thus are more conformationally flexible. Consequently, they often cannot be modeled using standard homology modeling techniques. More constrained versions of loop modeling are also used in the data fitting stages of solving a protein structure by [[X-ray crystallography]], because loops can correspond to regions of low [[electron density]] and are therefore difficult to resolve.

Regions of a structural model that are predicted by non-template-based loop modeling tend to be much less accurate than regions that are predicted using template-based techniques. The extent of the inaccuracy increases with the number of [[amino acid]]s in the loop. The loop amino acids' [[side chain]]s [[dihedral angle]]s are often approximated from a [[rotamer]] library, but can worsen the inaccuracy of side chain packing in the overall model. [[Andrej Sali]]'s homology modeling suite [[MODELLER]] includes a facility explicitly designed for loop modeling by a satisfaction of spatial restraints method. All methods require an upload of the [[Protein Data Bank (file format)|PDB]] file and some require the specification of the loop location.

==Short loops==

In general, the most accurate predictions are for loops of fewer than 8 amino acids.  Extremely short loops of three residues can be determined from geometry alone, provided that the bond lengths and bond angles are specified.  Slightly longer loops are often determined from a "spare parts" approach, in which loops of similar length are taken from known crystal structures and adapted to the geometry of the flanking segments.  In some methods, the bond lengths and angles of the loop region are allowed to vary, in order to obtain a better fit; in other cases, the constraints of the flanking segments may be varied to find more "protein-like" loop conformations.  The accuracy of such short loops may be almost as accurate as that of the homology model upon which it is based.   It should also be considered that the loops in proteins may not be well-structured and therefore have no one conformation that could be predicted; [[protein NMR|NMR experiments]] indicate that solvent-exposed loops are "floppy" and adopt many conformations, while the loop conformations seen by [[X-ray crystallography]] may merely reflect crystal packing interactions, or the stabilizing influence of crystallization co-solvents.

==Template Based Techniques==

As mentioned above homology-based methods use a database to align the target protein gap with a known template protein. A database of known structures is searched for a loop that fits the gap of interest by similarity of sequence and stems (the edges of the gap created by the unknown loop structure). The success of this method largely depends on the quality of that alignment. Since the loop is the least [[conserved sequence|conserved]] portion of a protein’s structure, the homology-based method cannot always find a known template that aligns with the target sequence. Fortunately, the template databases are always adding new templates so the problem of not being able to find an alignment is becoming less of an issue. Some programs that use this method are SuperLooper and FREAD.

==Non-Template Based Techniques==

Otherwise known as an ''ab initio'' method, non-template based approaches use a statistical model to fill in the gaps created by the unknown loop structure. Some of these programs include MODELLER, Loopy, and RAPPER; but each of these programs approaches the problem in a different manner. For example, Loopy uses samples of torsion angle pairs to generate the initial loop structure then it revises this structure to maintain a realistic shape and closure, while RAPPER builds from one end of the gap to the other by extending the stem with different sampled angles until the gap is closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holtby|first=Daniel|author2=Shuai Cheng Li |author3=Ming Li |title=LoopWeaver – Loop Modeling by the Weighted Scaling of Verified Proteins|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2012|volume=7262|issue=3|pages=113–126|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-29627-7_11|pmid=23461572|pmc=3590895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another method is the “divide and conquer” approach. This involves subdividing the loop into 2 segments and then repeatedly dividing and transforming each segment until the loop is small enough to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosatto|first=SC|author2=Bindewald, E |author3=Hesser, J |author4= Männer, R |title=A divide and conquer approach to fast loop modeling.|journal=Protein Engineering|date=Apr 2002|volume=15|issue=4|pages=279–86|pmid=11983928|doi=10.1093/protein/15.4.279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with all these methods non-template based approaches are most accurate up to 12 residues (amino acids within the loop).

There are three problems that arise when using a non-template based technique. First, there are constraints that limit the possibilities for local region modeling. One such constraint is that loop termini are required to end at the correct anchor position. Also, the [[Ramachandran plot|Ramachandran]] space cannot contain a backbone of [[dihedral angle]]s. Second, a modeling program has to use a set procedure. Some programs use the “spare parts” approach as mentioned above. Other programs use a ''[[De novo protein structure prediction|de novo]]'' approach that samples sterically feasible loop conformations and selects the best one. Third, determining the best model means that a scoring method must be created to compare the various conformations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=AN|author2=Peng, J |author3=Wilde, M |author4=Xu, J |author5=Freed, KF |author6= Sosnick, TR |title=Modeling large regions in proteins: applications to loops, termini, and folding.|journal=Protein Science|date=Jan 2012|volume=21|issue=1|pages=107–21|pmid=22095743|doi=10.1002/pro.767|pmc=3323786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''Lévy distribution''', named after [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], is a [[continuous probability distribution]] for a non-negative [[random variable]]. In [[spectroscopy]], this distribution, with frequency as the dependent variable, is known as a  '''van der Waals profile'''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"van der Waals profile" appears with lowercase "van" in almost all sources, such as: ''Statistical mechanics of the liquid surface'' by Clive Anthony Croxton, 1980, A Wiley-Interscience publication, {{isbn|0-471-27663-4}}, {{isbn|978-0-471-27663-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wve2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Van+der+Waals+profile%22&amp;dq=%22Van+der+Waals+profile%22&amp;hl=en]; and in ''Journal of technical physics'', Volume 36, by Instytut Podstawowych Problemów Techniki (Polska Akademia Nauk), publisher: Państwowe Wydawn. Naukowe., 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2XpVAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Van+der+Waals+profile%22&amp;dq=%22Van+der+Waals+profile%22&amp;hl=en]&lt;!-- and many more --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a special case of the [[inverse-gamma distribution]]. It is a stable distribution.


==Definition==

The [[probability density function]] of the Lévy distribution over the domain &lt;math&gt;x\ge \mu&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\mu,c)=\sqrt{\frac{c}{2\pi}}~~\frac{e^{ -\frac{c}{2(x-\mu)}}} {(x-\mu)^{3/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[location parameter]] and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scale parameter]]. The cumulative distribution function is

:&lt;math&gt;F(x;\mu,c)=\textrm{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{c}{2(x-\mu)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textrm{erfc}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the complementary [[error function]]. The shift parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; has the effect of shifting the curve to the right by an amount &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, and changing the support to the interval [&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;). Like all [[stable distribution]]s, the Levy distribution has a standard form f(x;0,1) which has the following property:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\mu,c)dx = f(y;0,1)dy\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''y'' is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{x-\mu}{c}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of the Lévy distribution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(t;\mu,c)=e^{i\mu t-\sqrt{-2ict}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the characteristic function can also be written in the same form used for the stable distribution with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(t;\mu,c)=e^{i\mu t-|ct|^{1/2}~(1-i~\textrm{sign}(t))}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming &lt;math&gt;\mu=0&lt;/math&gt;, the ''n''th [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of the unshifted Lévy distribution is formally defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;m_n\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \sqrt{\frac{c}{2\pi}}\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-c/2x}\,x^n}{x^{3/2}}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

which diverges for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 so that the moments of the Lévy distribution do not exist. The [[moment generating function]] is then formally defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;M(t;c)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \sqrt{\frac{c}{2\pi}}\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-c/2x+tx}}{x^{3/2}}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

which diverges for &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and is therefore not defined in an interval around zero, so that the moment generating function is not defined ''per se''. Like all [[stable distribution]]s except the [[normal distribution]], the wing of the probability density function exhibits heavy tail behavior falling off according to a power law:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\mu,c) \sim \sqrt{\frac{c}{2\pi}}\frac{1}{x^{3/2}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; as &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

(This shows that Lévy is not just [[Heavy-tailed distribution|Heavy-tailed]] but also [[Fat-tailed distribution|Fat-tailed]].)  

This is illustrated in the diagram below, in which the probability density functions for various values of ''c'' and &lt;math&gt;\mu=0&lt;/math&gt; are plotted on a log-log scale.

The standard Lévy distribution satisfies the condition of being [[Stable_distribution|Stable]]
: &lt;math&gt; (X_1 + X_2 + \dotsb + X_n) \sim n^{1/\alpha}X &lt;/math&gt;, 

where &lt;math&gt;X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n, X &lt;/math&gt; are independent standard Lévy-variables with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Related distributions==
* If &lt;math&gt;X \sim \textrm{Levy}(\mu,c)\, &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; k X + b \sim \textrm{Levy}(k \mu + b ,k c) \,&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;X\,\sim\,\textrm{Levy}(0,c)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;X\,\sim\,\textrm{Inv-Gamma}(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{c}{2})&lt;/math&gt; ([[inverse gamma distribution]])

* If &lt;math&gt;X \sim \textrm{Normal}(\mu,\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma}})\, &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;{(X-\mu)}^{-2} \sim \textrm{Levy}(0,\sigma)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;X\,\sim\,\textrm{Levy}(\mu,c)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;X\,\sim\,\textrm{Stable}(1/2,1,c,\mu) \,&lt;/math&gt; ([[Stable distribution]])
* If &lt;math&gt;X\,\sim\,\textrm{Levy}(0,c)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;X\,\sim\,\textrm{Scale-inv-}\chi^2(1,c)&lt;/math&gt; ([[Scaled-inverse-chi-squared distribution]])
* If &lt;math&gt;X\,\sim\,\textrm{Levy}(\mu,c)&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;{(X-\mu)}^{-\tfrac{1}{2}} \sim\,\textrm{FoldedNormal}(0,1/\sqrt{c})&lt;/math&gt; ([[Folded normal distribution]])

==Random sample generation==
Random samples from the Lévy distribution can be generated using [[inverse transform sampling]]. Given a random variate ''U'' drawn from the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] on the unit interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1], the variate ''X'' given by&lt;ref&gt;How to derive the function for a random sample from a Lévy Distribution: http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/special/Levy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;X=F^{-1}(U)=\frac{c}{(\Phi^{-1}(1-U/2))^2}+\mu&lt;/math&gt;

is Lévy-distributed with location &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and scale &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the cumulative distribution function of the standard [[normal distribution]].

==Applications==

* The frequency of [[geomagnetic reversal]]s appears to follow a Lévy distribution&lt;!-- for ref see that article --&gt;
*The [[hitting time|time of hitting]] a single point &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (different from the starting point 0) by the [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]] has the Lévy distribution with &lt;math&gt;c=\alpha^2&lt;/math&gt;. (For a Brownian motion with drift, this time may follow an [[inverse Gaussian distribution]], which has the Lévy distribution as a limit.)

'''M82 X-2''' is an [[X-ray pulsar]] located in the galaxy [[Messier 82]], approximately 12 million [[light-year]]s from Earth.&lt;ref name="llnl20141009"/&gt; It is exceptionally luminous, radiating energy equivalent to approximately ten million [[Sun]]s. This object is part of a [[binary star|binary system]]: If the pulsar is of an average size, {{solar mass|1.4|link=yes}}, then its companion is at least {{solar mass|5.2|link=yes}}.&lt;ref name="nasa20141008a"/&gt; On average, the pulsar rotates every 1.37 seconds, and revolves around its more massive companion every 2.5 days.{{sfn|Smith et al.|1995|p=202}}

M82 X-2 is an [[ultraluminous X-ray source]] (ULX), shining about 100 times brighter than theory suggests something of its mass should be able to. Its brightness is many times higher than the [[Eddington limit]], a basic physics guideline that sets an upper limit on the brightness that an object of a given mass should be able to achieve. Possible explanations for violations of the Eddington limit include geometrical effects arising from the funneling of in-falling material along magnetic field lines.

While M82 X-2 was previously known as an X-ray source, it was not until an observation campaign to study the newly discovered supernova [[SN 2014J]] in January 2014 that X-2's true nature was uncovered.&lt;ref name="caltech20141008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="futurity20141009"/&gt; Scientists looking at data from the [[NuSTAR]] spacecraft noticed a pulsing in the X-ray spectrum coming from near the supernova in Messier 82.&lt;ref name="llnl20141009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa20141008b"/&gt; Data from the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] and [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] spacecraft was used to verify the NuSTAR findings and provide the necessary [[spatial resolution]] to determine the exact source.&lt;ref name="nasa20141008a"/&gt;{{sfn|Smith et al.|1995|p=202}} After combining the NuSTAR and Chandra data, scientists were able to discern that M82 X-2 emitted both an X-ray beam and continuous broad X-ray radiation.{{sfn|Smith et al.|1995|p=204}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1022">The '''Manned Orbital Development System''' was created by the US Air Force [[Space System Division]] (SSD) in June 1962. It was to begin working on plans to use [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] hardware as the first step in a new [[USAF|US Air Force]] man-in-space program called MODS (Manned Orbital Development System), a type of military space station that used [[Gemini spacecraft]] as ferry vehicles. The term [[Blue Gemini]] first showed up in August 1962 as part of a more specific proposal to fly six Gemini missions with Air Force pilots in a preliminary orientation and training phase of MODS.  MODS was effectively superseded when the [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]] was announced in December 1963.

'''Molinology''' (from [[Latin]]: molīna, mill; and [[Greek language|Greek]] λόγος, study) is the study of mills and other mechanical devices which use the energy of moving water or wind, or the strength of animal or human muscle to power machines for purposes such as [[hammer]]ing, [[Grinder (milling)|grinding]], [[pump]]ing, [[saw]]ing, [[Crusher|pressing]] or [[fulling]]. More particularly, molinology aims to retain the knowledge of those traditional engines which have been rendered obsolete by modern technical and economic trends. 

The term "Molinology" was coined in 1965 by the Portuguese industrial historian João Miguel dos Santos Simões. 

Cultural and scientific interest in molinology is maintained by [[The International Molinological Society]] (TIMS), a non-profit organisation which brings together around five hundred members worldwide. It was founded in 1973 after earlier international symposia in 1965 and 1969.

The '''NIH Intramural Research Program''' ('''IRP''') is the internal research program of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), known for its synergistic approach to [[biomedical science]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oversight/NIH-IRP_Redbook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; With 1,200 [[Principal Investigator]]s and over 4,000 [[Postdoctoral]] Fellows conducting basic, [[translational research|translational]], and clinical research, the NIH Intramural Research Program is the largest biomedical research institution on earth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership Organization and Leadership | NIH Intramural Research Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The unique funding environment of the IRP facilitates opportunities to conduct both long-term and high-impact science that would otherwise be difficult to undertake. With rigorous external reviews ensuring that only the most outstanding research secures funding,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/sci-review/blue-ribbon-toc.htm Blue Ribbon Panel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the IRP is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of [[fluoride]] to prevent tooth decay, the use of [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] to manage [[bipolar disorder]], and the creation of [[vaccines]] against [[hepatitis]], Hemophilus influenzae ([[HIB]]), and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the IRP has also produced or trained 21 [[Nobel Prize]]-winning scientists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Mission==
Within the framework of the NIH mandate, the Intramural Research Program’s mission is to:
* Conduct distinctive, laboratory, clinical, behavioral, translational and population-based research that breaks new ground and defines scientific excellence &lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://irp.nih.gov/about-us About Us | NIH Intramural Research Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facilitate new approaches to improve health through prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment by developing and/or using innovative technologies, approaches or devices &lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
* Respond rapidly to critical [[public health]] needs &lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
* Train the next generation of biomedical and behavioral researchers &lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
* Foster sharing of information and dissemination of the IRP’s major discoveries to the public through partnerships with academic institutions and industry &lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

==History==
The NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) traces its roots to 1887, when a one-room laboratory on [[Staten Island]] was created within the Marine Hospital Service, a predecessor agency to the [[U.S. Public Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/ A Short History of the National Institutes of Health&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This laboratory evolved into the Hygienic Laboratory, which moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1891 and, with the [[Ransdell Act]] of 1930, became the National Institute of Health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/history History | NIH Intramural Research Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the IRP’s initial Institutes were established over the next two decades and, after World War II, [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]], outlined a program for postwar scientific research that affirmed the contributions of "remote and unexpected fields of medicine and the underlying sciences" in the progress against disease and the benefits of cooperative endeavors with industry and academia.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; 
	
The disease orientation and categorical structure of the IRP had its genesis in the establishment of the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) in 1944.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1948, Congress passed the National Heart Act, which created the National Heart Institute, and soon after established institutes for research on mental health, oral diseases, neurological problems, and blindness.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Today, the IRP consists of individual programs housed in 23 of the NIH Institutes and Centers, creating a network of multi-disciplinary, federally funded laboratories with an emphasis on [[translational research]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;  The [[National Institutes of Health Clinical Center]], the world’s largest clinical research hospital, is designed to foster smooth transitions between laboratory work, patient studies, and bedside cures, facilitating the translation of laboratory findings to new approaches for the prevention and cure of human diseases.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Organization and Leadership==
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is composed of 27 Institutes and Centers, most of which include research programs led by a Scientific Director and conducted by federal researchers and their trainees at one of several NIH campus locations. Collectively, these research programs encompass the Intramural Research Program (IRP).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; The IRP includes the [[United States National Library of Medicine]], an international resource for researchers, and the NIH Clinical Center, the world’s largest clinical research hospital.

Intramural researchers are affiliated with individual Laboratories, Branches or Centers, which are typically organized around common thematic research goals and approaches, much like a department or center at an [[academic institution]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Within these larger structures, [[Principal Investigator]]s run Sections or Units devoted to their independent research goals. Core facilities, supported by staff scientists and clinicians, are among the shared resources available to IRP researchers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Scientific interests are not bound by the organizational structure. There exists a full spectrum of scientific interest groups (called SIGs) that brings researchers from different Institutes and Centers together around common areas of scientific interest where ideas can be shared and collaborations initiated.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://irp.nih.gov/our-research/scientific-focus-areas Scientific Focus Areas | NIH Intramural Research Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, institutes come together to work cooperatively on major initiatives focused on unraveling the complexities of disease.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation (CHI) is one example of this trans-NIH cooperative research approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/chi/ Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation. NHLBI. NIH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As with all biomedical research, the scientific programs of the IRP’s 1,200 Principal Investigators are subject to periodic scientific review.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Each Principal Investigator must be peer-reviewed at least once every four years by an external Board of Scientific Counselors (BSC). The BSC evaluates the quality of research, the resources that should be allocated to scientists, and the promise of tenure-track investigators for future success in their careers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; These evaluations are based on the Principal Investigator’s past accomplishments, objectives met, and future plans.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The review criteria mirror those used by extramural peer review with the addition of considering whether the investigator is taking advantage of the special features of the NIH intramural scientific environment and employing useful collaborative arrangements.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; As a result of these reviews, recommendations for altering allocated resources are prepared by the BSC for the Scientific Director, the Institute or Center Director, the NIH Deputy Director for Intramural Research, and the Institute or Center (IC) National Advisory Council or Board.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

Additionally, each IRP as a whole is subject to periodic review by [[Blue Ribbon Panel]]s. These panels, made up of expert external reviewers appointed by the NIH Director, ensure that the program’s overall objectives are current, relevant, distinctive, and appropriate to the unique research environment of the IRP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Blue Ribbon Panel reports are addressed to the NIH Director, the Advisory Committee of the Director, and the IC Director. 

In addition to the external NIH Boards of Scientific Counselors and Blue Ribbon Panels, the NIH IRP receives regular and periodic independent evaluations by the following external bodies:
* [[U.S. Congress]] and its committees; [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]]  &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[National Academies of Sciences]], [[Institute of Medicine]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Office of the Inspector General]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Office of Management and Budget]] (e.g., Program Assessment Rating Tool) &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[The Joint Commission]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* [[Association for Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs]] &lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

[[Michael M. Gottesman]], M.D. is the Deputy Director for Intramural Research and heads the Office of Intramural Research (OIR).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; In this role, he is responsible for oversight and coordination of all intramural research, training and technology transfer activities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In the field of [[nuclear engineering]], a '''rabbit''' refers to a pneumatically controlled tool used to insert small samples of material inside the core of a nuclear reactor usually for the purpose studying the effect of irradiation on the material. Some rabbits have special linings to screen out certain types of neutrons. (For example, the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]] research reactor uses a [[cadmium]]-lined rabbit to allow only high-energy neutrons through to samples in its core.)&lt;ref name="MissouriS&amp;T"&gt;{{cite web

==Naming==
Ralph is named after a character in ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' (1950s television show),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/honeymooners.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television - Honeymooners, The|website=www.museum.tv|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with another ''New Horizons'' instrument, Alice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-mission-honors-memory-of-engineer-lisa-hardaway|title=NASA’s New Horizons Mission Honors Memory of Engineer Lisa Hardaway|last=Gipson|first=Lillian|date=2017-06-23|work=NASA|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEISA's acronym was retitled from ''Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array'' to ''Lisa Hardaway Infrared Mapping Spectrometer'' by NASA in June 2017, after Ralph's program manager.&lt;ref name="nasa20170623"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-new-horizons-mission-honors-memory-of-engineer-lisa-hardaway |title=NASA's New Horizons Mission Honors Memory of Engineer Lisa Hardaway |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Lillian |editor-last=Gipson |date=June 23, 2017 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Schrödinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality'''''  is a 1995 book by [[John Gribbin]], in which the author attempts to explain the mysteries of modern [[quantum mechanics]] in a [[popular science|popular-scientific]] way. It is a sequel to his earlier book, ''[[In Search of Schrödinger's Cat]]'' (1984).

In his epilogue, Gribbin touches on what were then the most recent developments of [[string theory]], and introduces the [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics as the new "[[mythology]]" of our time.  His argument does not refute the theory, but demonstrates how all theories can be true and mythological (depending on one's perspective).

He worked for most of his life as a religious timekeeper (''muwaqqit'') at the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;King, David A. (1975). [https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-2968(197504)34%3A2%3C81%3AAQT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6 "Al-Khalili's qibla table"], ''Journal of Near-Eastern Studies'' 34(2), pp. 81-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Little else is known about his life.

==Work==
Al-Khalili is known for two sets of [[mathematical tables]] he constructed, both totaling roughly 30,000 entries. He tabulated all the entries made by the celebrated Egyptian Muslim astronomer [[Ibn Yunus]], except for the entries that al-Khalili made himself for the city of Damascus. He computed 13,000 entries into his 'Universal Tables' of different auxiliary functions which allowed him to generate the solutions of standard problems of [[spherical astronomy]] for any given latitude. In addition to this, he created a 3,000 entry table that gave the direction of the city of [[Mecca]] (the [[Qibla]]) for all latitudes and longitudes for all the Muslim countries of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;King, David A. (1973). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1973JHA.....4...99K "Al-Khalili's auxiliary tables for solving problems of spherical astronomy"], ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'' 4(2), pp. 99-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the direction of the Qibla is essential in Islam because Muslims pray in the direction of Mecca. The values present in al-Khalili’s tables have been determined to be accurate up to three or four significant decimal digits. Up to the present time, it is not known how exactly al-Khalili went about calculating each of his entries.&lt;ref&gt;G Van Brummelen (1991).

In [[sociology]] and [[economics]], '''Social dualism''' is a theory developed by economist Julius Herman Boeke which characterizes a society in the economic sense by the social spirit, the organisational forms and the technique dominating it.&lt;ref name=dual-economy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/dual-economy-theory.php|publisher=EconomyProfessor.com|title=Dual economy theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boeke, "These three aspects are interdependent and in this connection typify a society, in this way that a prevailing social spirit and the prevailing forms of organisation and of technique give the society its style, its appearance, so that in their interrelation they may be called the social system, the social style or the social atmosphere of that society&lt;ref name="Mishra Puri"&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics of Development and Planning|year=2010|publisher=Himalaya Publishing House|location=Mumbai|isbn=978-81-8488-829-4|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; ".

== The dual society ==
According to Boeke, it is not necessary that a society be dominated exclusively by one social system. If one social system does prevail, the society in question is a homogeneous society. When, on the contrary two (or more) social systems appear simultaneously, we have a dual society.
Boeke qualifies the term dual society by using it only for societies "showing a distinct cleavage of two synchronic and full grown social styles which in the normal, historical evolution of homogeneous societies are separated from each other by transitional forms, as for instance, pre-capitalism and high capitalism by early capitalism."&lt;ref name="dual-economy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mishra Puri"/&gt;

This qualification is necessary because every society going through the process of evolution or endogenic social progression shows besides the prevailing social systems, the remains of the preceding and the beginnings of its future social style. If, on the other hand, one social system is imported from abroad and this system fails to oust or assimilate the prevailing social system, a dual society obviously exists.

On this account Boeke defines a dual society as a society where "one of the two prevailing social systems, as a matter of fact always the most advanced, will have been imported from abroad and have gained its existence in the new environment without being able to oust or assimilate the divergent social system that has grown up there, with the result that neither of them becomes general and characteristic for that society as a whole."

== Characteristics of a dualistic economy ==
;Overriding importance of social needs
The first characteristic of dualistic economies pointed out by Boeke is the relatively greater importance of social needs as compared to western economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Development|author=Todaro|author2=Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeke states, "Possessions in the share of cattle, land, clothes, and houses, the fulfilment of social duties in all the circumstances of likr, must be all regarded as largely the satisfaction of social needs. It is not their economic usefulness, not the individual services they render their possessor which determine the value of the goods. It is a matter of secondary importance whether the land produces reasonable profit in proportion to the money paid for it whether the cattle can be made reasonably useful to their owner in his own business,whether the clothing covers, protects,warms the wearer or affects him pleasantly in any way. For it is not the use of these objects to the subject himself that gives them their worth in his eyes; it is what the community thinks of them that sets the standard.

== Criticism ==
{{POV check|section|date=November 2013|talk=Criticism}}

The social dualism theory has been criticised by Benjamin Higgins on the following grounds:
# ''The Wants Are Not Limited'': If we analyse “Indonesia’s life” we do not find that the desires of the people are limited because here the values of MPC and MPM are higher. This is the reason that the government has to impose import restrictions. Moreover, whenever the harvest is good, farmers become prosperous and the demand for luxurious goods rises.
# ''Casual Labor Are Not Unorganized'': Boeke presented the version that casual workers are unorganised and passive. But this may be true as far as agricultural sector is concerned but they are not unorganised in coffee, tea, rubber and plantation etc.
# ''Eastern Labor Is Not Immobile'': Boeke thought that eastern labor is immobile. It is not so because of attraction of modern facilities of life in the urban areas. Moreover, the high income incentives force the labor to move from rural areas to urban areas.
# ''Dualistic Theory Is Not Particular To Under Developed Countries Only'': The eastern society, according to Boeke, only exists in under-developed countries. It is not true. It does exist in Canada, Italy and even in the United States.
# ''Applicability To Western Society'': According to Professor Higgins most of the characteristics of eastern society given by Boeke are present even in the western societies. For example, during hyper inflation, speculation is preferred to investment. This means, the people in the western countries also have a strong desire to keep their capital safe and in liquid form. The western society also believes in conspicuous consumption as discussed by veblin and snob effects. The backward bending supply curve of efforts has been experienced by Australia during post war period and by US in the fifties.
# ''Not A Theory But A Description'': It is objected that the Boeke’s dualistic theory is merely a description rather than a theory. His findings are based upon neo—classical theory which has the limited applicability in the western world.
# ''Does Not Provide Solution To The Problem Of Unemployment'': Boeke’s dualism centers more on socio—cultural aspects rather on economic. He only says that government is not in a position to remove unemployment. Moreover, he does not mention the situation of under employment. Therefore, his theory is full of shortcomings. 
Higgins argues that the main issue in dualistic economies is to provide employment opportunities and Boeke's theory fails to do it and has developed the theory of [[Technological dualism]] as a response.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6942">In [[combinatorics]], a '''square-free word''' is a [[String (computer science)|word]] (a sequence of characters) that does not contain any [[Substring#Substring|subword]] twice in a row.

Thus a square-free word is one that [[Avoidable pattern|avoids the pattern]] ''XX''.&lt;ref name=LotII112&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LotII114&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Over a two-letter alphabet {''a, b''} the only square-free words are the empty word and ''a'', ''b'', ''ab'', ''ba'', ''aba'', and ''bab''.   However, there exist infinite square-free words in any [[alphabet]] with three or more symbols,&lt;ref name=LotII113/&gt;  as proved by [[Axel Thue]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Thue, Über unendliche Zeichenreihen, Norske Vid. Skrifter I Mat.-Nat. Kl., Christiania 7 (1906) 1–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Thue, Über die gegenseitige Lage gleicher Teile gewisser Zeichenreihen, Norske Vid. Skrifter I Mat.-Nat. Kl., Christiania 1 (1912) 1–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of an infinite square-free word over an alphabet of size 3 is the word over the alphabet {0,±1} obtained by taking the [[first difference]] of the [[Thue–Morse sequence]].&lt;ref name=PF104&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS97&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.97&lt;/ref&gt; That is, from the Thue–Morse sequence
:0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...
one forms a new sequence in which each term is the difference of two consecutive terms of the Thue–Morse sequence. The resulting square-free word is
:1, 0, &amp;minus;1, 1, &amp;minus;1, 0, 1, 0, &amp;minus;1, 0, 1, &amp;minus;1, 1, 0, &amp;minus;1, ... {{OEIS|id=A029883}}.

Another example found by [[John Leech (mathematician)|John Leech]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=J. | last=Leech | authorlink=John Leech (mathematician) | title=A problem on strings of beads | journal=Math. Gazette | volume=41 | year=1957 | pages=277–278 | zbl=0079.01101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined recursively over the alphabet {''a, b, c''}.  Let &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; be any word starting with the letter ''a''. Define the words &lt;math&gt; \{w_i \mid i \in \mathbb{N} \}&lt;/math&gt; recursively as follows: the word &lt;math&gt;w_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; by replacing each ''a'' in &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; with {{not a typo|''abcbacbcabcba''}}, each ''b'' with {{not a typo|''bcacbacabcacb''}}, and each ''c'' with {{not a typo|''cabacbabcabac''}}.  It is possible to check that the sequence converges to the infinite square-free word
:{{not a typo|''abcbacbcabcbabcacbacabcacbcabacbabcabacbcacbacabcacb''...}}

==Related concepts==
A '''cube-free''' word is one with no occurrence of ''www'' for a factor ''w''.  The [[Thue–Morse sequence|Thue-Morse sequence]] is an example of a cube-free word over a binary alphabet.&lt;ref name=LotII113&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.113&lt;/ref&gt;  This sequence is not square-free but is "almost" so: the [[Critical exponent of a word|critical exponent]] is 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Developments in Language Theory]]: Proceedings 10th International Conference, DLT 2006, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, June 26-29, 2006 | volume=4036 | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | editor1-first=Oscar H. | editor1-last=Ibarra | editor2-first=Zhe | editor2-last=Dang | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2006 | isbn=3-540-35428-X | first=Dalia | last=Krieger | chapter=On critical exponents in fixed points of non-erasing morphisms | pages=280–291 | zbl=1227.68074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Thue–Morse sequence has no '''overlap''' or ''overlapping square'', instances of 0''X''0''X''0 or 1''X''1''X''1:&lt;ref name=LotII113/&gt; it is essentially the only infinite binary word with this property.&lt;ref name=BLRS81&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dejean's theorem]] characterizes the minimum possible critical exponents for each alphabet size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Thue number]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] ''G'' is the smallest number ''k'' such that ''G'' has a ''k''-coloring for which the sequence of colors along every [[Path (graph theory)|simple path]] is squarefree.

The [[Kolakoski sequence]] is an example of a cube-free sequence.

An '''abelian ''p''-th power''' is a subsequence of the form &lt;math&gt;w_1 \cdots w_p&lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is a permutation of &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt;.  There is no abelian-square-free infinite word over an alphabet of size three: indeed, every word of length eight over such an alphabet contains an abelian square.  There is an infinite abelian-square-free word over an alphabet of size five.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Sustainable engineering''' is the process of designing or operating systems such that they use energy and resources [[sustainability|sustainably]], in other words, at a rate that does not compromise the natural environment, or the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

==As an aspect of engineering disciplines==

Every engineering discipline is engaged in sustainable design, employing numerous initiatives, especially [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA), [[pollution prevention]], design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and  design for recycling (DfR).  These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a "cap and trade" has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a "bubble" over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a "stack-by-stack" and "pipe-by-pipe" approach, i.e. the so-called "command and control" approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life-cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sustainable_Design.html?id=vrj5DIQ-7m8C|&lt;/ref&gt;  
Historically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. [[Green engineering]] recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach.  Green engineering attempts to achieve four goals:&lt;ref name="C. Brasier 2008"&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Waste reduction;
# Materials management;
# Pollution prevention; and,
# Product enhancement.

Green engineering encompasses numerous ways to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental and sustainable standpoint. Every one of these approaches depends on viewing possible impacts in space and time. Architects consider the sense of place. Engineers view the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary. The design must consider short and long-term impacts. Those impacts beyond the near-term are the province of sustainable design. 
The effects may not manifest themselves for decades. In the mid-twentieth century, designers specified the use of what are now known to be hazardous building materials, such as asbestos flooring, pipe wrap and shingles, lead paint and pipes, and even structural and mechanical systems that may have increased the exposure to molds and radon. Those decisions have led to risks to people inhabiting these buildings.  It is easy in retrospect to criticize these decisions, but many were made for noble reasons, such as fire prevention and durability of materials. However, it does illustrate that seemingly small impacts when viewed through the prism of time can be amplified exponentially in their effects.
Sustainable design requires a complete assessment of a design in place and time. Some impacts may not occur until centuries in the future. For example, the extent to which we decide to use nuclear power to generate electricity is a sustainable design decision. The radioactive wastes may have half-lives of hundreds of thousands of years. That is, it will take all these years for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay. Radioactive decay is the spontaneous transformation of one element into another. This occurs by irreversibly changing the number of protons in the nucleus. Thus, sustainable designs of such enterprises must consider highly uncertain futures. For example, even if we properly place warning signs about these hazardous wastes, we do not know if the English language will be understood.
All four goals of green engineering mentioned above are supported by a long-term, life cycle point of view. A life cycle analysis is a holistic approach to consider the entirety of a product, process or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and final disposal. In other words, assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product.
The first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society. Once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known, the important functions and impacts of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal are estimated. Thus, in sustainable design, engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames.&lt;ref name="C. Brasier 2008"/&gt;

==Accomplishments from 1992 to 2002==
*The World Engineering Partnership for [[Sustainable development|Sustainable Development]] (WEPSD) was formed and they are responsible for the following areas: redesign engineering responsibilities and ethic to sustainable development, analyze and develop a long term plan, find solution by exchanging information with partners and using new technologies, and solve the critical global environment problems, such as [[fresh water]] and climate change
*CASI Global was formed mainly as a platform for corporates and governments to share best practices; with a mission to promote the cause and knowledge of csr &amp; sustainability. Thousands of corporates and colleges across the world are now a part of CASI Global with a view to support this mission. CASI also offers Global Fellow programs on finance / operations / manufacturing / supply chain / etc. with a dual specialization in Sustainability. The idea is every professional has inculcate sustainability within their core function &amp; industry. http://www.casiglobal.us/ 
*Developed environmental policies, codes of ethics, and sustainable development guidelines
*[[Earth Charter]] was restarted as a [[civil society]] initiative
*The World Bank, [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environmental Program]], and the [[Global Environment Facility]] joined programs for sustainable development
*Launched programs for engineering students and practicing engineers on how to apply sustainable development concepts in their work
*Developed new approaches in industrial processes

== Sustainable housing ==
In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatt hours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much electricity does an American home use? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url = http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&amp;t=3|website = www.eia.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential sector itself uses 18%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much energy is consumed in the world by each sector? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url = http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=447&amp;t=1|website = www.eia.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the total energy generated and therefore, incorporating sustainable construction practices there can be significant reduction in this number. Basic Sustainable construction practices include : 
# '''Sustainable Site and Location:''' One important element of green that is often overlooked happens to simply be where we choose to build. Avoiding inappropriate sites such as farmland and locating the site near existing infrastructure, like roads, sewers, stormwater systems and transit, allows builders to lessen negative impact on a home's surroundings.
# '''Water Conservation:''' Conserving water can be economically done by installing low-flow fixtures that often cost the same as less efficient models. Water can be saved in landscaping applications by simply choosing the proper plants.
# '''Materials:''' Green materials include many different options. Most often, people assume that "green" means recycled materials. Although that recycled materials represent one option, green materials also include reused materials, renewable materials like bamboo and cork, or materials local to your region. Remember, a green material does not have to cost more or be of lesser or higher quality. Most green products are comparable to their non-green counterparts.
# '''Energy Conservation:''' Probably the most important part of building green is energy conservation. By implementing passive design, structural insulated panels (SIPs), efficient lighting, and renewable energy like [[solar energy]] and [[geothermal energy]], a home can benefit from reduced energy consumption or qualify as a net-zero energy home.
# '''Indoor Environmental Quality:''' The quality of the indoor environment plays a pivotal role in a person's health. In many cases, a much healthier environment can be created through avoiding hazardous materials found in paint, carpet, and other finishes. It is also important to have proper ventilation and ample day lighting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Green Homes vs Traditional Homes - Buildipedia|url = http://buildipedia.com/at-home/design-remodeling/green-homes-vs-traditional-homes|website = buildipedia.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02|first = Michael Tolson MBA, LEED|last = AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Savings===
# '''Water Conservation:''' A newly constructed home can implement products with the WaterSense label at no additional costs and achieve a water savings of 20% when including the water heater savings and the water itself.
# '''Energy Conservation:''' Energy conservation is definitely the most intensive when it comes to cost premiums for implementation. However, it also has the largest potential for savings. Minimum savings can be achieved at no additional cost by pursuing passive design strategies. The next step up from passive design in the level of green (and ultimately the level of savings) would be implementing advanced building envelopematerials, like structural insulated panels (SIPs). SIPs can be installed for approximately $2 per linear foot of exterior wall. That equals a total premium of less than $500 for a typical one-story home, which will bring an energy savings of 50%. According to the DOE, the average annual energy expense for a single family home is $2,200. So SIPs can save up to $1,100 per year. To reach the savings associated with a net-zero energy home, renewable energy would have to be implemented on top of the other features. A geothermal energy system could achieve this goal with a cost premium of approximately $7 per square foot, while a photovoltaic system (solar) would require up to a $25,000 total premium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Technology trajectory''' refers to a single branch in the evolution of a technological design of a product/service, with nodes representing separate designs.

Movement along the technology trajectory is associated with research and development. Due to institutionalisation of ideas, markets and professions, a technology development can get 'stuck' within one trajectory, and firms and engineers unable to adopt to ideas and innovation from outside.

'''''The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World''''' is a nonfiction book released in 2015, by the historian [[Andrea Wulf]] about the [[Prussian]] [[natural science|naturalist]], [[List of explorers|explorer]] and [[geography|geographer]] [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. The book follows Humboldt from his early childhood and travels through Europe as a young man to his journey through Latin America and his return to Europe. Wulf makes the case that Humboldt synthesized knowledge from many different fields to form a vision of nature as one interconnected system, that would go on to influence scientists, activists and the public.

== Sections ==
'''Part 1. Departure: Emerging Ideas'''

Wulf describes Humboldt's childhood with his emotionally distant mother. As a child his interests in nature and travel were not taken seriously. His mother, on whom he was financially dependent, insisted he become a civil servant.  As a young man, Humboldt became friends with [[Goethe]] and other German intellectuals. His mother's death allowed him the freedom and financial independence needed to journey to the new world.

'''Part 2 Arrival: Collecting Ideas'''

Humboldt arrives in Cuba with his companion Bonpland and begins his journey through Central and South America. He brought with him a plethora of scientific instruments. He chronicles his travels and the measurements he obtained using scientific instruments in his journals. Humboldt climbs the Chimborazo Volcano, which was then believed to be highest mountain in the world. The trip concludes with his visit to the United States where he visited the White House to discuss science and politics with Thomas Jefferson before returning to Europe.

'''Part 3 Return: Sorting Ideas'''

Humboldt returns to Europe where he is greeted as a celebrity. He lives as an expat in Paris for a seven months as he finds the city and its scientific culture more stimulating than that of Berlin. While in France, he meets a young [[Simon Bolivar]], who is impressed with Humboldt's knowledge and passion for his home country of Venezuela, and they discuss South American politics. Humboldt returns to Prussia, to earn a salary in the King's court before returning to Paris. At this point he begins to work several manuscripts based on his travels. The books are widely read. As Bolivar begins to plan and execute Revolutions in South America, Humboldt publishes a series of books on the politics of Latin America that criticize colonialism.

'''Part 4 New Worlds: Spreading Ideas'''

Wulf discusses Humboldt's personal correspondence and influence on a young [[Charles Darwin]]. Darwin attributed the inspiration for his voyage on the Beagle to Humboldt. Humboldt's influence on the American poet and philosopher [[Henry David Thoreau]] is explored. Humboldt's magnum opus ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'', where he talks of the interconnections of the natural world, is discussed.

== Reception ==

Invention of Nature became a [[New York Times bestseller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Sellers: Expeditions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2015/12/13/expeditions-disasters-and-adventures/|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=27 June 2016|date=December 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics felt that the book could have covered Humboldt more thoroughly instead of focusing on people he influenced.&lt;ref&gt;Price, M.

{{History of war}}
[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|right|The mushroom cloud produced by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of the city of Hiroshima]] during [[World War II]]. The bombing was an act of total war.]]
'''Total war''' is [[war]]fare that includes any and all [[civilian]]-associated resources and infrastructure as [[legitimate military target]]s, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over [[non-combatant]] needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as "war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] or [[combatant]]s involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the [[law of war|laws of war]] are disregarded."

In the mid-19th century, scholars identified "total war" as a separate class of warfare. In a total war, to an extent inapplicable in less total conflicts, the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants diminishes and sometimes it even vanishes entirely because opposing sides can consider nearly every human resource, even that of non-combatants, to be a part of the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gunn. "The Moral Dilemma of Atomic Warfare", ''Aegis: The [[Otterbein College]] Humanities Journal'', Spring 2006, [http://www.otterbein.edu/Aegis/Aegis_2006.pdf#page=67 p. 67]. NB Gunn cites this Wikipedia article as  it was on {{diff|Total war|pref|24038262|27 September 2005}}, but on only for the text of the song "The Thing-Ummy Bob".&lt;/ref&gt;

Actions that may characterize the post-19th century concept of total war include:
* [[Strategic bombing]], as during [[Strategic bombing during World War II|World War II]], the [[Korean War#Bombing North Korea|Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]] (Operations [[Operation Rolling Thunder|Rolling Thunder]] and [[Operation Linebacker II|Linebacker II]])
* [[Blockade]] and [[siege|sieging]] of population centers, as with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[blockade of Germany]] and the [[Siege of Leningrad]] during the [[Blockade of Germany|First]] and [[Blockade of Germany (1939–45)|Second]] World Wars
* [[Scorched earth]] policy, as with the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] during the [[American Civil War]] and the Japanese "[[Three Alls Policy]]" during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]
* [[Commerce raiding]], [[tonnage war]], and [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], as with [[privateer]]ing, the German [[U-boat|U-Boat]] campaigns of the First and Second World Wars, and the United States [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|submarine campaign against Japan]] during World War II
* [[Collective punishment]], pacification operations, and [[reprisal]]s against populations deemed hostile, as with the execution and deportation of suspected [[Communards]] following the fall of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]] or the German reprisal policy targeting resistance movements, insurgents, and [[Untermensch]]en such as in France (e.g. [[Maillé massacre]]) and [[Pacification actions in German-occupied Poland|Poland]] during World War II
* The use of [[civilian]]s and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] as [[forced labor]] for [[military operation]]s, as with Japan and Germany's massive use of forced laborers of other nations during World War II (see [[Slavery in Japan]] and [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Forced labor under German rule during World War II]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the Road to Total War: The American Civil War and the German Wars of Unification, 1861–1871 (Publications of the German Historical Institute) |page=296 |date=August 22, 2002 |publisher=[[German Historical Institute]] |isbn=0-5215-2-119X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Giving [[no quarter]] (i.e. take no prisoners), as with [[Hitler]]'s [[Commando Order]] during [[World War II]].

==Etymology==
The phrase can be traced back to the 1935 publication of the World War I memoir of German General [[Erich Ludendorff]], ''Der totale Krieg'' ("The total war").{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}  Some authors extend the concept back as far as classic work of [[Carl von Clausewitz]], ''[[On War]]'', as "absoluter Krieg" ([[absolute war]]); however, different authors interpret the relevant passages in diverging ways.&lt;ref name="StrachanHerberg-Rothe2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hew Strachan|author2=Andreas Herberg-Rothe|title=Clausewitz in the twenty-first century|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-923202-4|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total war also describes the French "guerre à outrance" during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name="ChickeringFörster2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chickering|author2=Stig Förster|title=The shadows of total war: Europe, East Asia, and the United States, 1919–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ne0rFJbWfdIC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81236-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taithe1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertrand Taithe|title=Defeated flesh: welfare, warfare and the making of modern France|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-5621-5|page=35 and 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Förster2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stig Förster|title=On the Road to Total War: The American Civil War and the German Wars of Unification, 1861–1871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qm4o2vsMTdYC&amp;pg=PA550|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52119-2|page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letter to his [[Chief of Staff]], Union General [[Henry Halleck]] on 24 December 1864 described that the Union was "not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war, as well as their organized armies," defending [[Sherman's March to the Sea]], the operation that inflicted widespread destruction of infrastructure in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/william-t-sherman-to-henry.html|title=William T.

[[United States Air Force]] General [[Curtis LeMay]] updated the concept for the [[nuclear age]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In 1949, he first proposed that a total war in the nuclear age would consist of delivering the entire [[nuclear arsenal]] in a single overwhelming blow, going as far as "killing a nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGroot|first=Gerard J.|title=The bomb: a life|year=2004|publisher=Harvard|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-674-01724-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VQCsAZpPrgC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=the%20entire%20stockpile%20of%20atomic%20bombs%20in%20a%20single%20massive%20attack&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[destruction under the Mongol Empire]] in the 13th century effectively exemplified total war.  The military forces of [[Genghis Khan]] slaughtered whole populations and destroyed any city that resisted:

{{quote|As an aggressor nation, the ancient Mongols, no less than the modern [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], practiced total war against an enemy by organizing all available resources, including [[military personnel]], [[noncombatant]] [[workers]], [[Military intelligence|intelligence]], [[transport]], [[money]], and [[wikt:provision|provisions]].&lt;ref&gt;Janice J. Terry, James P. Holoka, Jim Holoka, George H. Cassar, Richard D. Goff (2011).

==18th and 19th centuries==

===Intertribal warfare===
Author and historian Mark van de Logt wrote: "Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of 'total war' for conflicts between modern industrial nations, the term nevertheless most closely approaches the state of affairs between the [[Pawnee people|Pawnees]] and the [[Great Sioux Nation|Sioux]] and [[Cheyennes]]. Both sides directed their actions not solely against warrior-combatants but against the people as a whole. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy's territory."&lt;ref&gt;Mark van de Logt (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bbgh_hA4ib4C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false War Party in Blue: Pawnee Scouts in the U.S. Army]''. University of Oklahoma Press. pp. 35–36. {{ISBN|0806184396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French and American Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars===
In The [[American Revolution]], also known as the American Revolutionary War, many basic tactics of Total War were created in a modern form, I.E. Scorched Earth. in 1779, The [[Sullivan Expedition]]  began, marching through Western Pennsylvania and up through New York, burning Iroquois villages to the ground, leaving nothing behind but smoldering ruin and dead bodies. In the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War]], The British and American Militia did similar campaigns of Extermination, but to their neighbors. Whole towns where depopulated. The British Cavalry led by [[Banastre Tarleton]] join the militia in the creation of the inferno called "South Carolina".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

{{quote|From this moment until such time as its enemies shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the armies. The young men shall fight; the married men shall forge arms and [[logistics|transport provisions]]; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old lint into linen; the old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic.}}

The wars merged into the [[Napoleonic Wars]] of the [[First French Empire]] from ca. 1803.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Over the coming two decades of almost constant warfare it is estimated that somewhere in the vicinity of five million died—probably about half of them civilians—and France alone counted nearly a million (by some sources in excess of a million) deaths.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the [[French invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]] of 1812 the Russians resorted to destroying infrastructure and agriculture in their retreat in order to hamper the French and strip them of adequate supplies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In the campaign of 1813, Allied forces in the German theater alone amounted to nearly one million whilst two years later in [[the Hundred Days]] a French decree called for the total mobilization of some 2.5 million men (though at most a fifth of this was managed by the time of the French defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} During the prolonged [[Peninsular War]] from 1808–1814 some 300,000 French troops were kept permanently occupied by, in addition to several hundred thousand Spanish, Portuguese and British regulars, an enormous and sustained guerrilla insurgency—ultimately French deaths would amount to 300,000 in the Peninsular War alone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Taiping Rebellion===

=== American Civil War===
During the [[American Civil War]], [[Union Army]] General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s [[Valley Campaigns of 1864#Sheridan's Valley Campaign (August – October 1864)|stripping of the Shenandoah Valley]], beginning on September 21, 1864 and continuing for two weeks, was considered "total war". {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Its purpose was to eliminate food and supplies vital to the South's military operations, as well as to strike a blow at Southern civilian morale.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Sheridan took the opportunity when he realized opposing forces had become too weak to resist his army.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Janda,  "Shutting the gates of mercy: The American origins of total war, 1860–1880."

Union Army General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s '[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]' in November and December 1864 destroyed the resources required for [[Confederate States of America|the South]] to make war. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] initially opposed the plan until Sherman convinced them of its necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=551|title=Sherman's March to the Sea – Ohio History Central|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars taking issue with the notion that Sherman was employing "total war" include Noah Andre Trudeau. Trudeau believes that Sherman's goals and methods do not meet the definition of total war and to suggest as much is to "misread Sherman's intentions and to misunderstand the results of what happened".&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, Noah Andre. "Southern Storm." Harper, 2008. p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

===World War I===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2008-0084, Belgien, Flandern, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Damage and destruction of civilian buildings in Belgium, 1914]]
Almost the whole of [[Europe]] and the European colonial empires mobilized to wage [[World War I]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Young men were removed from production jobs to serve in military roles, and were replaced on the production line by women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Rationing occurred on the home fronts.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Bulgaria]] went so far as to mobilize a quarter of its population or 800,000 people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
One of the features of Total War in Britain was the use of government [[propaganda]] posters to divert all attention to the war on the [[home front]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Posters were used to influence public opinion about what to eat and what occupations to take, and to change the attitude of support towards the war effort.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Even the [[Music Hall]] was used as propaganda, with propaganda songs aimed at recruitment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After the failure of the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], the large British offensive in March 1915, the British Commander-in-Chief [[Field Marshal]] John French blamed the lack of progress on insufficient and poor-quality [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shells]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This led to the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] which brought down both the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Premiership]] of [[H.

===World War II===
The [[Second World War]] was the quintessential total war of modernity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The level of national mobilization of resources on all sides of the conflict, the [[battlespace]] being contested, the scale of the [[armies]], [[navies]], and [[air forces]] raised through [[conscription]], the active targeting of non-combatants (and non-combatant property), the general disregard for [[collateral damage]], and the unrestricted aims of the belligerents marked total war on an unprecedented and unsurpassed, multicontinental scale.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Shōwa Japan====
During the first part of the [[Shōwa era]], the government of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] launched a string of policies to promote a total war effort [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against China]] and [[Pacific war|occidental powers]] and increase industrial production. Among these were the [[National Spiritual Mobilization Movement]] and the [[Taisei Yokusankai|Imperial Rule Assistance Association]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[National Mobilization Law]] had fifty clauses, which provided for government controls over civilian organizations (including [[labor union]]s), [[nationalization]] of strategic industries, price controls and [[rationing]], and nationalized the [[news media]].&lt;ref&gt;Pauer, Japan's War Economy, 1999 pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The laws gave the government the authority to use unlimited budgets to subsidize war production, and to compensate manufacturers for losses caused by war-time mobilization. Eighteen of the fifty articles outlined penalties for violators.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

To improve its production, Shōwa Japan used millions of [[slave labour]]ers&lt;ref&gt;Unidas, Naciones. ''World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slavery in Japan|pressed more than 18 million people]] in [[East Asia]] into forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;Zhifen Ju, "''Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war''", 2002, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, "Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45"] Access date: February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Before the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[United Kingdom]] drew on its [[World War I|First World War]] experience to prepare legislation that would allow immediate mobilization of the economy for war, should future hostilities break out.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Rationing of most goods and services was introduced, not only for consumers but also for manufacturers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This meant that factories manufacturing products that were irrelevant to the war effort had more appropriate tasks imposed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} All artificial light was subject to legal [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

|quote="..There is another more obvious difference from 1914. The whole of the warring nations are engaged, not only soldiers, but the entire population, men, women and children.

The workmen are soldiers with different weapons but the same courage."

Not only were men conscripted into the armed forces from the beginning of the war (something which had not happened until the middle of World War I), but women were also conscripted as [[Land Girls]] to aid farmers and the [[Bevin Boys]] were conscripted to work down the coal mines.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Enormous casualties were expected in bombing raids, so [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during the Second World War|children were evacuated from London and other cities en masse to the countryside]] for compulsory [[billet]]ing in households. In the long term this was one of the most profound and longer-lasting social consequences of the whole war for Britain.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This is because it mixed up children with the adults of other classes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Not only did the middle and upper classes become familiar with the urban squalor suffered by working class children from the [[slum]]s, but the children got a chance to see animals and the countryside, often for the first time, and experience rural life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The use of statistical analysis, by a branch of science which has become known as [[Operational Research]] to influence military tactics was a departure from anything previously attempted.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} It was a very powerful tool but it further dehumanised war particularly when it suggested strategies which were counter intuitive.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Examples where statistical analysis directly influenced tactics include the work done by [[Patrick Blackett]]'s team on the optimum size and speed of convoys and the introduction of [[bomber stream]]s by the [[Royal Air Force]] to counter the night fighter defences of the [[Kammhuber Line]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Germany====
In contrast, [[Germany]] started the war under the concept of [[Blitzkrieg]]. Officially, it did not accept that it was in a total war until [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Sportpalast speech]] of 18 February 1943.
{{Quote box

The commitment to the doctrine of the short war was a continuing handicap for the Germans; neither plans nor state of mind were adjusted to the idea of a long war until the failure of the [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} A major strategical defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]] forced [[Albert Speer]], who was appointed as Germany's armament minister in early 1942, to nationalize German war production and eliminate the worst inefficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Milward. The End of the Blitzkrieg. The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 16, No. 3 (1964), pp. 499–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Speer's direction a threefold increase in armament production occurred and did not reach its peak until late 1944.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} To do this during the damage caused by the growing strategic Allied bomber offensive, is an indication of the degree of industrial under-mobilization in the earlier years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} It was because the German economy through most of the war was substantially under-mobilized that it was resilient under air attack.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Civilian consumption was high during the early years of the war and inventories both in industry and in consumers' possession were high.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} These helped cushion the economy from the effects of bombing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Plant and machinery were plentiful and incompletely used, thus it was comparatively easy to substitute unused or partly used machinery for that which was destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Foreign labour, both slave labour and labour from neighbouring countries who joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Germany, was used to augment German industrial labour which was under pressure by conscription into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (Armed Forces).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Soviet Union====
[[File:RIAN archive 216 The Volkovo cemetery.jpg|thumb|Three men burying victims of [[siege of Leningrad|Leningrad's siege]], in which about 1 million civilians died.]]
The Soviet Union (USSR) was a [[planned economy|command economy]] which already had an economic and legal system allowing the economy and society to be redirected into fighting a total war.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The transportation of factories and whole labour forces east of the [[Urals]] as the Germans advanced across the USSR in 1941 was an impressive feat of planning.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Only those factories which were useful for war production were moved because of the total war commitment of the Soviet government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Eastern Front of the [[European Theatre of World War II]] encompassed the conflict in [[central Europe|central]] and [[eastern Europe]] from June 22, 1941 to May 9, 1945. It was the largest theatre of war in history in terms of numbers of soldiers, equipment and [[World War II casualties|casualties]] and was notorious for its unprecedented ferocity, destruction, and immense loss of life (see [[World War II casualties]]). The fighting involved millions of [[Nazi army|German]], Hungarian, Romanian and [[Red army|Soviet]] troops along a broad front hundreds of kilometres long. It was by far the deadliest single theatre of [[World War II]]. Scholars now believe that at most 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, including at least 8.7 million soldiers who fell in battle against [[Hitler]]'s armies or died in [[POW]] camps. Millions of civilians died from [[starvation]], exposure, atrocities, and massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm |work= BBC.co.uk |title= Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead |accessdate= 5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Axis lost over 5 million soldiers in the east as well as many thousands of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;German losses according to: Rüdiger Overmans, ''Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg''. Oldenbourg 2000. {{ISBN|3-486-56531-1}}, p. 265, 272&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], newly built [[T-34 tank]]s were driven—unpainted because of a paint shortage—from the factory floor straight to the front. &lt;!-- World at War series not sure which programme number--&gt;This came to symbolise the USSR's commitment to the [[Great Patriotic War]] and demonstrated the government's total war policy.

====United States====
The United States underwent an unprecedented mobilization of national resources for the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Conditions in the United States were not as strained as they were in the United Kingdom or as desperate as they were in the Soviet Union, but the United States greatly curtailed nearly all non-essential activities in its prosecution of the Second World War and redirected nearly all available national resources to the conflict, including reaching the point of diminishing returns by late 1944, where the U.S. military was unable to find any more males of the correct military age to draft into service.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The strategists of the U.S. military looked abroad at the storms brewing on the horizon in Europe and Asia, and began quietly making contingency plans as early as the mid-1930s; new weapons and weapons platforms were designed, and made ready. Following the outbreak of war in Europe and the ongoing aggression in Asia, efforts were stepped up significantly.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The collapse of France and the airborne aggression directed at Great Britain unsettled the Americans, who had close relations with both nations, and a peacetime draft was instituted, along with [[Lend-Lease]] programs to aid the British, and covert aid was passed to the Chinese as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

American [[public opinion]] was still opposed to involvement in the problems of Europe and Asia, however.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In 1941, the Soviet Union became the latest nation to be invaded, and the U.S. gave her aid as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} American ships began defending aid convoys to the Allied nations against submarine attacks, and a total trade embargo against the [[Empire of Japan]] was instituted to deny its military the raw materials its factories and military forces required to continue its offensive actions in China.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In late 1941, Japan's [[Imperial Japanese Army|Army]]-dominated government decided to seize by military force the strategic resources of South-East Asia and Indonesia since the Western powers would not give Japan these goods by trade.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Planning for this action included [[surprise attack]]s on American and British forces in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, and the U.S. naval base and warships at [[Pearl Harbor]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In response to these attacks, the U.K. and U.S. declared war on the [[Empire of Japan]] the next day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Nazi Germany]] declared war on the U.S. a few days later, along with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]]; the U.S. found itself fully involved in a second world war.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As the United States began to gear up for a major war, information and propaganda efforts were set in motion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Civilians (including children) were encouraged to take part in fat, grease, and scrap metal collection drives. Many factories making non-essential goods retooled for war production.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Levels of industrial productivity previously unheard of were attained during the war; multi-thousand-ton convoy ships were routinely built in a month-and-a-half, and tanks poured out of the former automobile factories.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Within a few years of the U.S. entry into the Second World War, nearly every man fit for service, between 18 and 30, had been conscripted into the military "for the duration" of the conflict, and unprecedented numbers of women took up jobs previously held by them. Strict systems of rationing of consumer staples were introduced to redirect productive capacity to war needs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Previously untouched sections of the nation mobilized for the war effort.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Academics became technocrats; home-makers became bomb-makers (massive numbers of women worked in heavy industry during the war); union leaders and businessmen became commanders in the massive armies of production.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The great scientific communities of the United States were mobilized as never before, and mathematicians, doctors, engineers, and chemists turned their minds to the problems ahead of them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

By the war's end a multitude of advances had been made in medicine, physics, engineering, and the other sciences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Even the [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]], whose theories were not believed to have military applications (at the time), were sent far into the Western deserts to work at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] on the [[Manhattan Project]] that culminated in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] and changed the course of history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the war, the United States lost 407,316 military personnel, but had managed to avoid the extensive level of damage to civilian and industrial infrastructure that other participants suffered. The U.S. emerged as one of the two [[superpower]]s after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The world since 1945: a history of international relations|last=McWilliams|first=Wayne|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unconditional surrender====

After the United States entered World War II, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] declared at [[Casablanca conference]] to the other Allies and the press that [[unconditional surrender]] was the objective of the war against the Axis Powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan.&lt;ref name="SOSCasablanca"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Casablanca Conference, 1943|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/casablanca|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this declaration, the individual regimes of the Axis Powers could have negotiated an [[armistice]] similar to that at the end of World War I and then a conditional surrender when they perceived that the war was lost.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The unconditional surrender of the major Axis powers caused a legal problem at the post-war [[Nuremberg Trials]], because the trials appeared to be in conflict with Articles 63 and 64 of the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention of 1929]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Usually if such trials are held, they would be held under the auspices of the defeated power's own legal system as happened with some of the minor Axis powers, for example in the post World War II [[Romanian People's Tribunals]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} To circumvent this, the Allies argued that the major war criminals were captured after the end of the war, so they were not prisoners of war and the Geneva Conventions did not cover them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Further, the collapse of the Axis regimes created a legal condition of total defeat (''[[debellatio]]'') so the provisions of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] over [[military occupation]] were not applicable.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Wedgwood {{cite web |url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pubaffairs/SAISarticles04/Wedgwood_WSJ_111604.pdf |title=Judicial Overreach |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308191908/http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pubaffairs/SAISarticles04/Wedgwood_WSJ_111604.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |df= }} [[Wall Street Journal]] November 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of World War II, no industrial nation has fought such a large, decisive war.&lt;ref name="GWUniversityWWII"&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II (1939-1945)|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/world-war-2.cfm|website=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project|publisher=George Washington University|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the availability of nuclear weapons, whose destructive power and quick deployment render a full mobilization of a country's resources such as in World War II unnecessary.{{sfn|Baylis|Wirtz|Gray|2012|p=55}} Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peacetime defense budgets.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

By the end of the 1950s, the [[ideology|ideological]] stand-off of the [[Cold War]] between the [[Western World]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had resulted in thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed by each side at the other.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Strategically, the equal balance of destructive power possessed by each side situation came to be known as [[Mutually assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] (MAD), considering that a nuclear attack by one superpower would result in nuclear counter-strike by the other.&lt;ref name="BBCMAD"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castella|first1=Tom de|title=How did we forget about mutually assured destruction?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17026538|accessdate=19 January 2017|work=BBC News|date=15 February 2012|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in hundreds of millions of deaths in a world where, in words widely attributed to [[Nikita Khrushchev]], "The living will envy the dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/73/1257.html|title=1257.

During the Cold War, the two [[superpower]]s sought to avoid open conflict between their respective forces, as both sides recognized that such a clash could very easily escalate, and quickly involve nuclear weapons.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in proxy wars, military buildups, and diplomatic standoffs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the case of proxy wars, each superpower supported its respective allies in conflicts with forces aligned with the other superpower, such as in the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

During the [[Yugoslav Wars]], [[NATO]] conducted strikes against the electrical grid in enemy territory using [[graphite bomb]]s. Some observers{{who|date=July 2018}} considered this to be an act of total war, owing to the fact that powerplants supported by the electrical grid were essential to water purification and thus the strike represented a direct attack on civilian resources. NATO claimed that the objective of their strikes was to disrupt military infrastructure and communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Michael|title=CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW; NATO AIR ATTACKS ON POWER PLANTS PASS A THRESHOLD|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/04/world/crisis-balkans-overview-nato-air-attacks-power-plants-pass-threshold.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He contributed articles to the ''[[Geological Magazine]]'', the ''[[Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London]]'', and the ''Proceedings of the Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society'', and several other learned journals.&lt;ref name=Dineley/&gt; He was awarded the [[Murchison Medal]] in 1914.

The Ussher Society, named in his honour, was founded in 1962 to promote the study of geology and geomorphology in southwest England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|website=Ussher Society|url=http://www.ussher.org.uk/Ussher_Society_History.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering''' ('''WYSE''') Academic Challenge is a high school academic competition run in [[Illinois]] and [[Missouri]] by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]], respectively.  The team competition consists of 14-person teams from multiple high schools each taking two exams. There are seven subject areas from which each student chooses their two tests: [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Computer Science]], [[Engineering drawing|Engineering Graphics]]/[[Technical drawing|Drafting]], [[English studies|English]], [[Mathematics]], and [[Physics]]. Awards are given to both teams and individuals at three progressively harder levels; Regionals, Sectionals, and the State Finals.

==Test Format==

The tests are 40 minute multiple choice tests. Each test has a different number of questions. Computer Science and Mathematics are 30 question exams; Physics 35; Biology 50; Chemistry, and Engineering Graphics 40; and English 80. These questions are divided into subcategories in each field; for instance, there are 14 [[Algebra]] questions, 7 [[Geometry]] questions, etc. on the Mathematics exam at the Regional Level.

==Competition Format==

Schools competing in the WYSE Competition are divided into 4 divisions based on their [[Illinois High School Association|IHSA]] classification enrollment; Division 300 features schools with a maximum of 300 enrolled students, Division 700 features schools with an enrollment larger than 300 and smaller than 700, Division 1500 from 700 to 1500, and Division Unlimited for schools larger than 1500 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wyse.engineering.illinois.edu/academic-challenge/registration/|title=Registration Information {{!}} Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering - Illinois|website=wyse.engineering.illinois.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tests are the same in each division.

Schools are divided geographically into Sectionals; nine in Illinois, two in Missouri. Each Sectional is divided again into smaller Regionals, and Sectionals can have anywhere from two to five Regionals within it. Schools from different divisions can and do attend the same Regional and Sectional, even though they do not compete against each other. Some Regionals may not be represented in certain Divisions if no schools of that enrollment participate in the competition. 

==Scoring System==
===Individual===
Tests are graded and ranked from highest score to lowest score. At Regionals and Sectionals, the top 3 scores in each test, including ties, are awarded medals. At the State Finals, the top 6 scores including ties are awarded medals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wyse.engineering.illinois.edu/files/2014/12/WYSE-2018-Coaches-Guide-1.pdf|title=2018 Academic Challenge Coaches' Guide|last=Lausell|first=Sahid|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Team===
Individual tests are graded and ranked from highest score to lowest score. The two highest scores in each subject for a school are added together to determine the school's Raw Score for that subject. If a school has only one score in a subject, the Raw Score is zero.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The highest Raw Score for a subject is considered the Normalizing Raw Score. This Raw Score is divided into 100 to find the Normalizing Constant. (100/Top Raw Score=Normalizing Constant) Every Raw Score for that subject in that division is then multiplied by the Normalizing Constant to find the school's normalized score. This is done for each subject in each division.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Once the normalized scores have been found, the school's score is determined by adding the normalized scores for five of the seven tests together. The five tests are English, Chemistry, Mathematics, and the two highest normalized scores of the remaining four tests (Biology, Computer Science, Engineering Graphics, and Physics).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Advancement==
Individuals and teams advance from Regionals to Sectionals to the State Finals based on their placement at the current level of competition.

=== Individual ===
Individuals who place 1st or 2nd, including ties, at either Regionals or Sectionals advance to the next level. Thus, if there is one 1st place individual and a four-way tie for 2nd, five individuals will advance to the next level for that subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the Sectional level, individuals can also advance to the State Finals by scoring a pre-determined qualifying score on a test. This prevents Sectionals from advancing only the top two scores when 
there are additional high scores below the 2nd place finisher(s).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If an individual qualifies to advance for one test, that individual still takes two tests at the next level, even if their school does not advance with the individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Team ===
Teams advance to the next level based on their finish compared to the number of schools competing.
If there are 1 or 2 teams competing, both advance.
If there are from 3-7 teams, the top 2 advance.
If there are from 8-12 teams, the top 3 advance.
If there are from 13-16 teams, the top 4 advance.
If there are more than 16 teams, the top 5 advance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
