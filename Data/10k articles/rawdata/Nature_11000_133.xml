'''Atlantic Canada''', also called the '''Atlantic provinces''', is the [[list of regions of Canada|region]] of Canada comprising the four [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] located on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]], excluding [[Quebec]]: the three [[the Maritimes|Maritime provinces]] – [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Prince Edward Island]] – and the easternmost province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2016 was about 2,300,000&lt;ref name=StatCan2016&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&amp;T=101&amp;S=50&amp;O=A | title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, 2016 and 2011 censuses – 100% data | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=2017-02-08 | accessdate=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; on half a million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The provinces combined had an approximate GDP of $121.888 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/econ15-eng.htm|title=Gross domestic product, expenditure-based, by province and territory.|last=|first=|date=Nov 9, 2016|website=Stats Canada|access-date=Feb 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011.

==History==
The first [[Premier of Newfoundland]], [[Joey Smallwood]], coined the term "Atlantic Canada" when [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] joined the [[Dominion of Canada]] in 1949. He believed that it would have been presumptuous for Newfoundland to assume that it could include itself within the existing term "[[The Maritimes|Maritime Provinces]]," used to describe the cultural similarities shared by [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]]. The three Maritime provinces entered [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] during the 19th century (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were founding members of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, and Prince Edward Island joined in 1873). Today, Atlantic Canada is a culturally distinct region of the country, with the original founding cultures of Celtic, English, and French remaining strong and vibrant to this day.

Although Quebec has physical Atlantic coasts on the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], [[Ungava Bay]], and the [[Hudson Strait]], it is generally not considered an Atlantic Province, instead being classified as part of [[Central Canada]] along with [[Ontario]].

[[File:Old Bedford River at Welney - geograph.org.uk - 688607.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Old Bedford River, photographed from the bridge at Welney, Norfolk (2008); the camera is looking downstream, south-west of the bridge]]

The '''Bedford Level experiment''' is a series of [[observation]]s carried out along a {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in|adj=on}} length of the [[Old Bedford River]] on the Bedford Level of the [[Cambridgeshire]] Fens in the [[United Kingdom]], during the 19th and early 20th centuries, to measure the [[figure of the Earth|curvature]] of the [[Earth]].  [[Samuel Birley Rowbotham]], who conducted the first observations starting in 1838, claimed he had proven the Earth to be [[Flat Earth|flat]]. However, in 1870, after adjusting Rowbotham's method to avoid the effects of [[atmospheric refraction]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] found a curvature consistent with a [[spherical Earth]].&lt;ref name=garwood /&gt;

== The Bedford Level ==

At the point chosen for all the experiments, the river is a slow-flowing drainage canal running in an uninterrupted straight line for a {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in|adj=on}} stretch to the north-east of the village of [[Welney]].  This makes it an ideal location to directly measure the curvature of the Earth, as Rowbotham wrote in ''[[Zetetic Astronomy]]:''

: IF the earth is a globe, and is 25,000 English statute miles in circumference, the surface of all standing water must have a certain degree of convexity—every part must be an arc of a circle. From the summit of any such arc there will exist a curvature or declination of 8 inches in the first statute mile. In the second mile the fall will be 32 inches; in the third mile, 72 inches, or 6 feet, as shown in the following diagram:

: [[File:Fig01.jpg|thumb|right|Earth's rate of curvature as shown in ''Zetetic Astronomy''. [[Vertical exaggeration]] 1000x.]]

: ...[A]fter the first few miles the curvature would be so great that no difficulty could exist in detecting either its actual existence or its proportion...In the county of Cambridge there is an artificial river or canal, called the "Old Bedford." It is upwards of twenty miles in length, and ... passes in a straight line through that part of the Fens called the "Bedford Level." The water is nearly stationary—often completely so, and throughout its entire length has no interruption from locks or water-gates of any kind; so that it is, in every respect, well adapted for ascertaining whether any or what amount of convexity really exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

Samuel Birley Rowbotham) |publisher=via sacred-texts.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiments ==

[[File:Rowbotham–curvature.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of Rowbotham's experiment on the Bedford Level, taken from his book "Earth not a globe"]]
The first experiment at this site was conducted by Rowbotham in the summer of 1838.  He waded into the river and used a telescope held {{convert|8|in|cm|spell=in}} above the water to watch a boat, with a flag on its mast {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} above the water, row slowly away from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zetetic Astronomy|first=Samuel|last=Rowbotham|year=1863|url=https://archive.org/details/zeteticastronom00rowbgoog|page=11|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that the vessel remained constantly in his view for the full {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} to Welney bridge, whereas, had the water surface been curved with the accepted circumference of a spherical earth, the top of the mast should have been some {{convert|11|ft|m}} below his line of sight. He published this observation using the pseudonym ''Parallax'' in 1849 and subsequently expanded it into a book, ''Earth Not a Globe'', published in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Samuel Birley (writing as "Parallax") |last= Rowbotham |year= 1881 |title= Earth Not a Globe |publisher= Simpkin, Marshall |location= London |isbn= 0-7661-4945-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:wallace-bedford-level.png|thumb|The view through Wallace's level as reproduced in his autobiography]]
Rowbotham repeated his experiments several times over the years but his claims received little attention until, in 1870, a supporter by the name of John Hampden offered a wager that he could show, by repeating Rowbotham's experiment, that the earth was flat. The noted naturalist and qualified surveyor [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] accepted the wager. Wallace, by virtue of his surveyor's training and knowledge of physics, avoided the errors of the preceding experiments and won the bet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date= 7 April 1870|volume=1|doi=10.1038/001581a0|page=581|issue=23|title=The Rotundity of the Earth|bibcode = 1870Natur...1..581. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title= The Form of the Earth: A Shock of Opinions |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 10 August 1871 |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1871/08/10/78770850.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The crucial steps were to
# Set a sight line 13 feet (4&amp;nbsp;m) above the water, and thereby reduce the effects of [[atmospheric refraction]], and
# Add a pole in the middle that could be used to see the "bump" caused by the curvature of the earth between the two end points.&lt;ref name=garwood&gt;{{cite book |first= Christine |last= Garwood |title= Flat Earth |publisher= Macmillan |year= 2007 |pages= 104–125 |isbn= 0-312-38208-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite Hampden initially refusing to accept the demonstration, Wallace was awarded the bet by the referee, editor of ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' sports magazine.
Hampden subsequently published a pamphlet alleging that Wallace had cheated and sued for his money. Several protracted court cases ensued, with the result that Hampden was imprisoned for threatening to kill Wallace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=My Life|first=Alfred Russel|last=Wallace|year=1908|pages=368–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2OA9IeEYUwYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[libel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hampden |first= John |year= 1870 |title= The Bedford Canal Swindle Detected &amp; Exposed |publisher= A. Bull |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Correspondent |date= 8 March 1875 |title= Spring Assizes |newspaper= [[The Times]] |location= London |page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same court ruled that the wager had been invalid because Hampden retracted the bet and required that Wallace return the money to Hampden.
Wallace, who had been unaware of Rowbotham's earlier experiments, was criticized by his peers for "his 'injudicious' involvement in a bet to 'decide' the most fundamental and established of scientific facts".&lt;ref name=garwood /&gt;

In 1901, [[Henry Yule Oldham]], a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in geography at [[King's College, Cambridge]], reproduced Wallace's results using three poles fixed at equal height above water level.  When viewed through a [[theodolite]] (a precision instrument for measuring angles), the middle pole was found to be almost {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} higher than the poles at each end.&lt;ref name=BA1901&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correspondent|date=25 September 1901|title=The British Association|journal=[[The Times]]|location=London|issue=36569|page=12|quote=Mr Yule Oldham on his re-measurement of the curvature of the Earth along the Bedford Level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oldham|first=H.

Advocates of a flat Earth, however, were not deterred: on 11 May 1904 Lady Elizabeth Anne Blount, who would go on to be influential in the formation of the [[Flat Earth Society]], hired a commercial photographer to use a telephoto lens camera to take a picture from Welney of a large white sheet she had placed, the bottom edge near the surface of the river, at Rowbotham's original position {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} away. The photographer, Edgar Clifton from [[Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer|Dallmeyer's studio]], mounted his camera two feet above the water at Welney and was surprised to be able to obtain a picture of the target, which he believed should have been invisible to him given the low mounting point of the camera. Lady Blount published the pictures far and wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Michell |first=John |year= 1984 |title= Eccentric Lives and Peculiar Notions |publisher= [[Thames and Hudson]] |location= London |isbn= 0-500-01331-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These controversies became a regular feature in the ''[[The English Mechanic and World of Science|English Mechanic]]'' magazine in 1904–05, which published Blount's photo and reported two experiments in 1905 that showed the opposite results. One of these, by Clement Stratton on the [[Ashby Canal]], showed a dip on a sight-line only above the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=[[The English Mechanic and World of Science]]|date=20 January 1905|author=Clement Stratton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refraction==

[[Atmospheric refraction]] can produce the results noted by Rowbotham and Blount. Because the density of air in the Earth's atmosphere decreases with height above the Earth's surface, all light rays travelling nearly horizontally bend downward (assuming a curve or change in air temperature along the line of sight). This phenomenon is routinely allowed for in [[Levelling#Refraction and Curvature|levelling]] and [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celnav.de/page2.htm|title=A short guide to Celestial Navigation|first=Henning|last= Umland|accessdate=14 November 2010|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Posn_Setting_Sun.jpg|thumb|250px|Atmospheric refraction causing an object below the horizon to be visible]]
If the measurement is close enough to the surface, light rays can curve downward at a rate equal to the mean curvature of the Earth's surface. In this case, the two effects of assumed curvature and refraction could cancel each other out and the Earth will appear flat in optical experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Umland|pp=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This would have been aided, on each occasion, by a [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] in the atmosphere with temperature increasing with altitude above the canal, similar to the phenomenon of the [[Superior mirage|superior image mirage]]. Temperature inversions like this are common. An increase in air temperature or [[lapse rate]] of 0.11 degrees [[Celsius]] per metre of altitude would create an illusion of a flat canal, and all optical measurements made near ground level would be consistent with a completely flat surface. If the lapse rate were higher than this (temperature increasing with height at a greater rate), all optical observations would be consistent with a concave surface, a "bowl-shaped earth". Under average conditions, optical measurements are consistent with a spherical Earth approximately 15% less curved than its true diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=David K |last2= Livingston |first2= William |title= Color and Light in Nature|year=2001 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-521-77504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repetition of the atmospheric conditions required for each of the many observations is not unlikely, and warm days over still water can produce favourable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naylor|first=John|title=Out of the Blue A 24-Hour Skywatcher's Guide|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2002|chapter=Mirages|isbn=0-521-80925-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar experiments conducted elsewhere==
On 25 July 1896, Ulysses Grant Morrow, a newspaper editor, conducted a similar experiment on the Old Illinois Drainage Canal, [[Summit, Illinois]]. Unlike Rowbotham, he was seeking to demonstrate that the surface of the earth was curved: when he too found that his target marker, {{convert|18|in|cm}} above water level and {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} distant, was clearly visible he concluded that the Earth's surface was [[Hollow_Earth#Concave_Hollow_Earths|''concavely'']] curved, in line with the expectations of his sponsors, the [[Koreshan Unity]] society. The findings were dismissed by critics as the result of atmospheric refraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Simanek |first= Donald E. |title= Turning the Universe Inside-Out |work=  |publisher= Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania |year= 2003 |url= http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hollow/morrow.htm |accessdate= 2 November 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121045617/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hollow/morrow.htm |archivedate= 21 November 2007 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teed|first=Cyrus|authorlink=Cyrus Teed|last2=Morrow |first2= Ulysses Grant|title=The Earth a Concave Sphere|publisher=Guiding Star|location=Estero, FL|year=1905|page=160|isbn=0-87991-026-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">The '''beneficial acclimation hypothesis''' ('''BAH''') is the [[physiology|physiological]] [[hypothesis]] that [[acclimatization|acclimating]] to a particular environment (usually thermal) provides an [[organism]] with advantages in that environment. First formally tested by [[Armand Marie Leroi]], Albert Bennett, and [[Richard Lenski]] in 1994, it has however been a central assumption in historical physiological work that acclimation is [[adaptive]].  Further refined by [[Raymond B. Huey]] and David Berrigan under the [[strong inference]] approach, the hypothesis has been [[Falsifiability|falsified]] as a general rule by a series of multiple hypotheses experiments.

== History and definition ==

Acclimation is a set of [[physiology|physiological]] responses that occurs during an individual's lifetime to chronic laboratory-induced environmental conditions (in contrast to [[acclimatization]]).  It is one component of [[adaptation]]. While physiologists have traditionally assumed that acclimation is beneficial (or explicitly defined it as such), criticism of the [[adaptationist program]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] led to a call for increased robustness in testing [[adaptationist]] hypotheses.&lt;ref name = "Gould"&gt;Gould, S.J and Lewontin, R.C. (1979). ''The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme.'' Proc. Roy. Soc. London B 205. pp. 581-598.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial definition of the BAH, as published in 1994 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Leroi et al., is that &lt;blockquote&gt;“acclimation to a particular environment gives an organism a performance advantage in that environment over another organism that has not had the opportunity to acclimate to that particular environment.”&lt;ref name = "Leroi"&gt;{{citation |authors=Leroi, A.M., Bennett, A.F. and Lenski, R. E. |year=1994 |title=Temperature acclimation and competitive fitness: An experimental test of the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1917–1921 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/91/5/1917.full.pdf |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.5.1917|pmid=8127906 |pmc=43275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; This definition was further reworked in an article in American Zoologist 1999 by Raymond B. Huey, David Berrigan, George W. Gilchrist, and Jon C. Herron.&lt;ref name = "Huey"&gt;Huey, R. B., Berrigan, D., Gilchrist, G.W. and Herron, J.C. (1999). ''Testing the Adaptive Significance of Acclimation: A Strong Inference Approach.'' Am. Zool. 39. pp. 323-336&lt;/ref&gt;  They determined that, following Platt's [[strong inference]] approach, multiple competing hypotheses were needed to properly assess beneficial acclimation.  These included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. '''Beneficial Acclimation'''. Acclimating to a particular environment confers [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantages in that environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2.''' Optimal Developmental Temperature'''. There is an ideal temperature to develop at so individuals reared at an optimal temperature compete better in all environments. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3. '''Colder (bigger) Is Better.''' In [[ectotherms]], individuals reared in colder environments tend to develop to a larger body size. These individuals therefore have a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantage in all environments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4. '''Warmer (smaller) Is Better.''' The inverse of '''Colder Is Better'''. Smaller individuals have a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;5. '''Developmental Buffering.''' Development temperature does not affect adult [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Experimental tests ==

The majority of tests of the beneficial adaptation hypothesis have, following [[Krogh's principle]], centered on the model organisms ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref name = "Huey" /&gt; More specifically, experimental tests have centered on easily  measured temperature adaptation (although other systems have been studied; see &lt;ref name = "Huey"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kristensen"&gt;Kristensen, T.N., Hoffmann, A. A., Overgaard, J., Sorensen, J.G., Hallas, R., and Loeschke, V. (2008). ''Costs and Benefits of Cold Acclimation in Field-Released Drosophila.'' PNAS. 105 (1). pp. 216-221.3.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Of the several experimental tests of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, most have rejected it as a universal rule (see reviews &lt;ref name = "Huey" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Woods"&gt;Woods, H.A. and Harrison, J.F. (2002). ''Interpreting Rejections of the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis: When is Physiological Plasticity Adaptive?'' Evolution. 56(9). pp. 1863-1866.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wilson"&gt;Wilson, R. S. and Franklin, C. E. (2002).'' Testing the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis.'' TREE. 17(2). pp. 66-70.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Initial experiments by Leroi ''et al.'', the first scientists to address this problem, tested only the beneficial acclimation hypothesis and not the subsequent hypotheses developed by Huey ''et al.''&lt;ref name = "Leroi" /&gt;  Colonies of ''E. coli'' were acclimated for seven generations in two different temperature conditions: 32&amp;nbsp;°C and 41.5&amp;nbsp;°C.  Colonies were then competed against each other at those temperatures.  He found that, agreeing with the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, colonies acclimated at 32&amp;nbsp;°C competed better at 32&amp;nbsp;°C. However, at 41.5&amp;nbsp;°C, colonies acclimated at 32&amp;nbsp;°C competed better as well. This led to the authors' rejection of the generality of beneficial acclimation.&lt;ref name = "Leroi" /&gt;
Huey ''et al.'' examined four previously conducted studies, applying the five competing hypotheses, and found that none of the results of the studies could be entirely explained by beneficial acclimation. Instead, a combination of hypotheses were required to explain the observed patterns of acclimation.&lt;ref name = "Huey" /&gt;

== Why acclimation is not beneficial ==

While it seems intuitive that acclimation would provide benefits to individuals, the majority of empirical tests of the hypothesis have rejected its general application.  Why then is acclimation not beneficial? H. Arthur Woods and Jon F. Harrison examined the possible reasons in a 2002 ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'' paper.&lt;ref name = "Woods" /&gt;  They suggested that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The timescale of [[adaptation]] is much longer than that of environmental variation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Environmental cues for timing of adaptive acclimation are unreliable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;3. It may cost more to adapt than not to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;4. [[wikt:Migration|Migration]] by adjacent populations may swamp out [[genes]] for adaptive acclimation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==

In response to continuing rejections of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, a number of common criticisms of experimental tests have been developed:&lt;ref name = "Huey" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Woods" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wilson"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The majority of studies have actually been examining developmental acclimation.  That is, rather than acclimating an adult individual and testing, they suggest that developmental switches triggered by particular temperatures result in a different mechanism of acclimation. More recently, it has been found that adult acclimation and developmental acclimation lead to support for different hypotheses.&lt;ref name = "Kristensen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Most studies have included stressful temperatures. Acclimation to those temperatures may decrease [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] in an individual.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;3. Finally, a variety of traits are examined in these studies that may only be indirectly linked to fitness. For example, examining [[longevity]] as a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] measure in ''D. melanogaster'' may be irrelevant since [[fertility]] declines rapidly with age in this species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Current state ==

The majority of studies have concluded the beneficial acclimation hypothesis is not true in all cases, and that alternate hypotheses should be tested.  In addition to this, recent  studies of the hypothesis have provided additional complications, such as trade-offs evident only in field environments&lt;ref name = "Kristensen" /&gt; and interactions with behavior and [[Biological life cycle|life history]] traits.&lt;ref name = "Deere"&gt;Deere, J.A. and Chown, S.L. (2006). ''Testing the Beneficial Acclimation Hypothesis and Its Alternatives for Locomotor Performance.'' Am. Nat. 168(5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Marais"&gt;Marais, E. and Chown, S.L. (2008). ''Beneficial Acclimation and the Bogert Effect.'' Ecol. Lett. 11. pp. 1027:1036.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of developmental and [[phenotypic plasticity]] continues.

The '''Beringia lowland tundra''' is a [[tundra]] [[ecoregion]] of North America, on the west coast of [[Alaska]], mostly covered in wetland.

==Setting==
These are areas of flat, wet, lowland on the Bering Sea coast of Alaska north as far as the [[Kotzebue Sound]], and on the eastern coasts of the offshore [[St Lawrence Island]] and [[St. Matthew Island]]. Lakes and ponds cover almost a quarter of the area, and wetlands cover most of it. The southern [[Bristol Bay]] end of this coast receives much more rainfall than Kotzebue Sound in the north.

==Flora==
These flat lands are mostly covered in sedges and grass with shrubland on the more sloping areas such as Bristol Bay. Sedge plants include ''[[Eriophorum angustifolium]]'' and ''[[Carex]]'' species, while the dominant shrubs are ericas such as crowberry (''[[Empetrum nigrum]]'').

==Fauna==
Wildlife includes large colonies of seabirds on the islands and waterbirds and shorebirds in the many wetlands such as the [[Kuskokwim River]] delta, one of the largest waterbird nesting areas in the world and home to the world's largest communities of [[tundra swan]], most of the world's [[emperor goose]], and half of the world's [[black brant]] (Branta bernicla). The lagoon that forms the heart of [[Izembek National Wildlife Refuge]] on the Alaska Peninsula has also long been recognised as an important staging ground for migrating  birds. Other birds of the coastal wetlands include [[bristle-thighed curlew]], [[dotterel]], [[bar-tailed godwit]], and [[Pacific golden plover]] while seabirds of include [[Steller's eider]] and the large colonies of [[murre]] on the islands.

Mammals include [[North American river otter]] (''Lontra canadensis''), [[stoat]] (''Mustela erminea''), [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), [[grizzly bear]] (''Ursus arctos horribilis''), [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), and [[caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus''). One of the largest bear populations is found in [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] and on [[Iliamna Lake]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na1106|name=Beringia lowland tundra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
This ecoregion is almost intact apart from small fishing settlements on the coasts. Protected areas include: in the north the [[Bering Land Bridge National Preserve]] on the [[Seward Peninsula]] and [[Selawik National Wildlife Refuge]]; the [[Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge]]; and around Bristol Bay and on the Alaska Peninsula, [[Togiak National Wildlife Refuge]] on the north of the bay, Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, [[Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge]] along the southern coast of the peninsula, [[Becharof National Wildlife Refuge]] and Katmai National Park and Preserve. Also St. Matthew Island is one of the many that make up [[Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge]].

The '''Calles-Morrow Agreement''' was brokered on the cusp of Mexican oil expropriation.  Political actors from Mexico and the United States negotiated the settlement over the course of 1927 and 1928, after “a decade of wrangling” between the two countries that followed the creation of the Mexican Constitution of 1917.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mexican Petroleum Industry in the Twentieth Century|last=|first=|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1992|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Jonathan C.|location=Austin|pages=xii|editor-last2=Knight|editor-first2=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Succinctly, Calles-Morrow affirmed the legitimacy of oil-land titles obtained, and maintained, by foreign industries prior to the ratification of the 1917 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scroggs|first=William O.|date=1940|title=Mexican Anxieties|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=18| issue =  2|pages=276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The political statement conveyed by the accord remains a topic of interpretive debate.  Some historians argue that Calles-Morrow revealed a delicate partiality on the part of Mexican president [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] toward foreign companies: concisely summarized, “where ‘positive acts’ had been performed prior to 1917, the companies received confirmatory concessions of indefinite duration.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mexican Petroleum Industry in the Twentieth Century|last=|first=|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1992|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Jonathan C.|location=Austin|pages=91|editor-last2=Knight|editor-first2=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others more drastically assert that through this agreement, Calles “attempted completely to surrender the country to foreign imperialism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carrillo|first=Alejandro|date=1938|title=Mexican People and the Oil Companies|url=|journal=World Affairs|volume=101| issue =  3|pages=171–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon President Calles’ entrance into office, it appeared as though his predecessor, [[Álvaro Obregón|Álvaro Obregón’s]], “personal promise to ease the pressure on the oil firms” would disintegrate under the new administration.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mexican Petroleum Industry in the Twentieth Century|last=|first=|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1992|isbn=|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Jonathan C.|location=Austin|pages=20|editor-last2=Knight|editor-first2=Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he served as the minister of industry, then-General Calles had attempted to negotiate an interim agreement affording “provisional” oil-drilling permits to international operators, contingent on their compliance with regulations determined by the Mexican government.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oil and Revolution in Mexico|last=Brown|first=Jonathan C.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=235–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foreign oil executives recoiled at the proposition, however, as they were “no more willing to comply with future legislation… than to pay royalties on land they already held under private contract.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Tensions between Calles’ administration and oil companies escalated to such an extent that in early 1927, foreign outfits began drilling illegally with the intention of prompting a governmental counter-response.  Sensing the looming menace of U.S. military involvement, Calles directed Mexican troops to seal oil wells and valves, before finally commanding General Lázaro Cárdenas to execute arson, strategically, at foreign-oil sites.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldhistory.biz/modern-history/81498-calles-and-the-united-states-1924-1934.html|title=Calles and the United States, 1924–1934|last=|first=|date=June 21, 2015|website=World History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the heart of the confrontation was a desire—notably shared by both sides—to resolve the fiscal and constitutional uncertainties (e.g. exactions and “pre-constitutional property rights”) surrounding oil production, following the drastic redefinitions that emerged from the Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

With the financial downturn that occurred in Mexico in 1927, Calles came to view an accord with foreign oil companies as an economic exigency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, the president remained “well aware of national [aversion toward] placing the control of natural resources in the hands of foreigners,” so he strove, in a shrewd political move, to “criticize[] the foreign oil companies while simultaneously creating a legal basis for their continued operation in Mexico.”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mexican Oil and Natural Gas: Political, Strategic and Economic Implications|last=Mancke|first=Richard B.|publisher=Praeger|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an agreement appeared increasingly imminent, social commentators of the day remarked that Calles’ possessed three potential directions: he could “actually confiscate oil fields held by Americans”; continue professing support for the 1917 Constitution, while avoiding any sort of concrete confiscation measures, behind the scenes; or else “admit the legality of American titles to Mexican oil lands.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Oil War in Mexico Grows More Intense|last=Ybarra|first=T.R.|date=April 10, 1927|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Into the scene stepped U.S. Ambassador [[Dwight Morrow]], a former “corporate lawyer and partner in… J.P. Morgan” whose banking history linked him to a number of Mexico’s creditors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Morrow made a significant impression on Calles, who proved receptive to Morrow’s alleged “face-saving solution… [in which the] Mexican Supreme Court would declare the [existing petroleum] law to be ex post facto.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As a result of the pair’s relative rapport, the titular agreement finally took shape.  Calles’ government altered the standing Petroleum Act of 1925 to permit the extension of so-called “confirmatory concessions” to oil corporations that had obtained their subsoil rights before the midway mark of 1917.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  These concessions  were dealt to applicant oil companies “without limitation[s] of time.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Mexican House Acts to Change Oil Law|last=|first=|date=December 27, 1927|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, Calles successfully lobbied the State Department to embrace the notion of “positive acts,” in which corporations would relinquish claims to “pre-1917 oil reserves on which they had made no improvements.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Oil companies did not receive the Calles-Morrow agreement well, as many claimed that “the new legislation did not go far enough” in securing them a lasting presence in Mexico.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Mexico Consults Morrow on Stabilizing Finances as Result of Oil Solution|last=Owen|first=Russell|date=January 7, 1928|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finding the concept of “concessions” to be condescending, recalcitrant petroleum executives desired “an amendment to the 1917 Constitution or a comprehensive definition of what were their rights on May 1, 1917.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Nonetheless, on the whole, U.S.-Mexican relations proceeded amicably for the remainder of Calles’ tenure, largely due to the Mexican president’s increasingly conservative leanings, which advantaged U.S. commercial interests.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In the end, however, Calles’ successor, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], effectively dismantled the Calles-Morrow agreement as he initiated an economic transition “from a phase of postrevolutionary reconstruction… to one of depression-induced industrialization and state intervention,” which manifested, finally, in the Mexican oil expropriation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The laws governing cattle slaughter in India vary greatly from state to state. The "Preservation, protection and improvement of stock and prevention of animal diseases, veterinary training and practice" is Entry 15 of the [[State List]] of the Seventh Schedule of the [[Constitution of India|Constitution]], meaning that [[State legislatures]] have exclusive powers to legislate the prevention of slaughter and preservation of cattle. Some States allow the slaughter of cattle with restrictions like a "fit-for-slaughter" certificate which may be issued depending on factors like age and gender of cattle, continued economic viability etc. Others completely ban cattle slaughter, while there is no restriction in a few states.&lt;ref name=simoon122&gt;{{cite book|author=F.J.

The scope, extent and status of animals in ancient India is a subject of scholarly dispute. One group interprets ancient Hindu texts as supporting animal sacrifice. For example, according to [[D. N. Jha]]’s 2009 work, The Myth of the Holy Cow, cattle including cows were neither inviolable nor revered in the ancient times as they were later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/research/cow-protection-hindutva-politics-bjp-india-5227382/|title=Why the cow is worshipped in Hindutva politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dwijendra Narayan Jha|Jha, Dwijendra Narayan]].

The cow has been a symbol of wealth in India since [[Ancient India|ancient times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC&amp;pg=PT108 |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |ISBN=978-81-8475-182-6 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
According to Nanditha Krishna, the cow veneration in ancient India "probably originated from the pastoral Aryans" in the Vedic era, whose religious texts called for non-violence towards all bipeds and quadrupeds, and often equated killing of a cow with the killing of a human being especially a [[Brahmin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |ISBN=978-81-8475-182-6 |pages=80, 101–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn 10.87.16 of the Hindu scripture ''[[Rigveda]]'' (~1200–1500 BCE), states Nanditha Krishna, condemns all killings of men, cattle and horses, and prays to god [[Agni]] to punish those who kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC&amp;pg=PT108 |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |ISBN=978-81-8475-182-6 |pages=15, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.८७ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.८७], Wikisource, Quote: "यः पौरुषेयेण क्रविषा समङ्क्ते यो अश्व्येन पशुना यातुधानः । यो अघ्न्याया भरति क्षीरमग्ने तेषां शीर्षाणि हरसापि वृश्च ॥१६॥"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3 Hindu deity Krishna on ceramic tile at Munnar Kerala India 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The iconography of popular Hindu deity [[Krishna]] often includes cows. He is revered in [[Vaishnavism]].]]
According to Harris, the literature relating to cow veneration became common in 1st millennium CE, and by about 1000 CE vegetarianism, along with a taboo against beef, became a well accepted mainstream Hindu tradition.&lt;ref name=harris201/&gt; This practice was inspired by the belief in Hinduism that a soul is present in all living beings, life in all its forms is interconnected, and non-violence towards all creatures is the highest ethical value.&lt;ref name=harris201/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemmerer2011p59"/&gt; Vegetarianism is a part of the Hindu culture. God [[Krishna]], one of the incarnations ([[Avatar]]) of Vishnu, is associated with cows, adding to its endearment.&lt;ref name=harris201/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemmerer2011p59"/&gt;

Many ancient and medieval Hindu texts debate the rationale for a voluntary stop to cow slaughter and the pursuit of vegetarianism as a part of a general abstention from violence against others and all killing of animals.&lt;ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludwig Alsdorf|title=The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHKMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-16641-0|pages=32–44 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mclane271&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

The Mahabharata debate presents one meat-producing hunter who defends his profession as [[dharma|dharmic]].&lt;ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"/&gt; The hunter, in this ancient Sanskrit text, states that meat consumption should be okay because animal sacrifice was practiced in the Vedic age, that the flesh nourishes people, that man must eat to live and plants like animals are alive too, that the nature of life is such every life form eats the other, that no profession is totally non-violent because even agriculture destroys numerous living beings when the plough digs the land.&lt;ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"/&gt; The hunter's arguments are, states Alsdorf, followed by stanzas that present support for restricted meat-eating on specific occasions.&lt;ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"/&gt;

The pro-vegetarianism sections of these Hindu texts counter these views. One section acknowledges that the Vedas do mention sacrifice, but not killing the animal. The proponents of vegetarianism state that Vedic teachings explicitly teach against killing, its verses can be interpreted in many ways, that the correct interpretation is of the sacrifice as the interiorized spiritual sacrifice, one where it is an "offering of truth (''[[satya]]'') and self-restraint (''[[Temperance (virtue)#Hinduism|damah]]'')", with the proper sacrifice being one "with reverence as the sacrificial meal and Veda study as the herbal juices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludwig Alsdorf|title=The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHKMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-16641-0|pages=39–42 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]] (1921), [https://archive.org/stream/vierphilosophisc00deusuoft#page/470/mode/2up Mahabharata XII], pages 471-473, 423-437, 764-765, 791-792 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The sections that appeal for vegetarianism, including abstention from cow slaughter, state that life forms exist in different levels of development, some life forms have more developed sensory organs, that non-violence towards fellow man and animals who experience pain and suffering is an appropriate ethical value. It states that one's guiding principle should be conscientious ''atmaupamya'' (literally, "to-respect-others-as-oneself").&lt;ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"/&gt;

According to Ludwig Alsdorf, "Indian vegetarianism is unequivocally based on ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence)" as evidenced by ancient ''[[smriti]]s'' and other ancient texts of Hinduism. He adds that the endearment and respect for cattle in Hinduism is more than a commitment to vegetarianism, it has become integral to its theology.&lt;ref name=alsdorf2/&gt; According to Juli Gittinger, it is often argued that cow sacredness and protection is a fundamental quality of Hinduism, but she considers this to be a false claim.&lt;ref name=gittinger17/&gt; This, states Gittinger, could be understood more as an example of "sanskritization" or presentation of certain traditions followed by its upper castes as purer, informed form of Hinduism and possibly an influence of Jainism on Hinduism.&lt;ref name=gittinger17&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gittinger|first1=Juli L.|title=The Rhetoric of Violence, Religion, and Purity in India’s Cow Protection Movement|journal=Journal of Religion and Violence|date=2017|volume=5|issue=2|pages=131–149|doi=10.5840/jrv201751540}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respect for cattle is widespread but not universal. Some Hindus ([[Shaktism]]) practice animal sacrifice and eat meat including beef at certain festivals. According to Christopher Fuller, animal sacrifices have been rare among the Hindus outside a few eastern states and Himalayan regions of the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=alsdorf2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher John Fuller|title=The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=To6XSeBUW3oC |year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12048-X|pages=46, 83–85, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the majority of modern Indians, states Alsdorf, respect for cattle and disrespect for slaughter is a part of their ethos and there is "no ''ahimsa'' without renunciation of meat consumption".&lt;ref name=alsdorf2&gt;{{cite book|last= Alsdorf|first= Ludwig|title=The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India|year =2010|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-11351-66-410|pages=2–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=iHKMAgAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jainism====
[[Jainism]] is against violence to all living beings, including cattle. According to the Jaina sutras, humans must avoid all killing and slaughter because all living beings are fond of life, they suffer, they feel pain, they like to live, and long to live. All beings should help each other live and prosper, according to Jainism, not kill and slaughter each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan J. Armstrong|author2=Richard G. Botzler|title=The Animal Ethics Reader|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qiQlDwAAQBAJ |year= 2016|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn= 978-1-317-42197-9|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|authorlink=Paul Dundas|title= The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ |year=2003| publisher=Routledge|isbn= 978-04152-66-055|pages= 160–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Jain tradition, neither monks nor laypersons should cause others or allow others to work in a slaughterhouse.&lt;ref name=kemmerer57&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Kemmerer|author2=Anthony J.

The Jain community leaders, states Christopher Chapple, has actively campaigned to stop all forms of animal slaughter including cattle.&lt;ref name="Chapple2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Chapple|title=Jainism and ecology: nonviolence in the web of life|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oIHXAAAAMAAJ|year= 2002|publisher= Harvard Divinity School|isbn=978-0-945454-33-5|pages=7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
The texts of [[Buddhism]] state [[ahimsa]] to be one of five ethical precepts, which requires a practicing Buddhist to "refrain from killing living beings".&lt;ref name="Kemmerer2011p100"/&gt; Slaughtering cow has been a taboo, with some texts suggest taking care of a cow is a means of taking care of "all living beings".

With the arrival of Islamic rule as the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the 12th-century, Islamic dietary practices entered India. According to the verses of the [[Quran]], such as 16:5–8 and 23:21–23, God created cattle to benefit man and recommends Muslims to eat cattle meat, but forbids pork.&lt;ref name="Phillips2008p116"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clive Phillips|title= The Welfare of Animals: The Silent Majority|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eq28F0MMrhIC |year= 2008|publisher= Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9219-0|pages=116–117, 98–99, 184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cattle slaughter had been and continued to be a religiously approved practice among the Muslim rulers and the followers of Islam, particularly on festive occasions such as the [[Eid al-Adha|Bakri-Id]].&lt;ref name="Phillips2008p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChapISec8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-i-introduction.aspx#item8 |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter I (8.

The earliest texts on the invasion of the Indian subcontinent mention the cow slaughter taboo, and its use by Muslim army commanders as a political message by committing the taboo inside temples.&lt;ref name="Asif2016p112"/&gt; For example, in the early 11th century narrative of [[Al-Biruni]], the story of 8th-century [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquest of [[Multan]] is mentioned. In this Al-Biruni narrative, according to [[Manan Ahmed Asif]] – a historian of Islam in South and Southeast Asia, "Qasim first asserts the superiority of Islam over the polytheists by committing a taboo (killing a cow) and publicly soiling the idol (giving the cow meat as an offering)" before allowing the temple to continue as a place of worship.&lt;ref name="Asif2016p112"&gt;{{cite book|author= Manan Ahmed Asif|title= A Book of Conquest|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3QD6DAAAQBAJ|year= 2016|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-97243-8|pages=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 13th-century Persian text of [[Chach Nama]], the defending fort residents call the attacking Muslims in rage as "Candalas and cow-eaters", but adds André Wink, the text is silent about "cow-worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=André Wink|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA151 |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=0-391-04173-8|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the texts of court historians of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and later the [[Mughal Empire]], cow slaughter taboo in India is mentioned, as well as cow slaughter as a means of political message, desecration, as well as its prohibition by Sultans and Muslim Emperors as a means of accommodation of public sentiments in the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Jackson|title=The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lt2tqOpVRKgC|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-54329-3|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of India as told by its own historians|chapter=Tabakat-i-Akbari by Nizamud Din Ahmad|author= H.M.

While most Muslims consider cattle to be a source of religiously acceptable meat, some Muslim [[Sufi]] sects of India practiced vegetarianism,&lt;ref name=saxena201/&gt; at least during periods of prayers and fasting. Their reasons, states [[Richard Foltz]], were same as other non-Muslim Indians, that is compassion for life and animals. According to Foltz, this Sufi practice was probably influenced by Hindus or Buddhists of South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Richard Foltz]]|title=Animals in Islamic Traditions and Muslim Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TFQQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50 |year=2014|publisher= Oxford: Oneworld|isbn= 978-1-78074-666-1|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity arrived on the Indian sea coast with Christian travelers and merchants.

The conversion ritual involved making the converts eat beef and pork as a confirmation that they have given up Hinduism or Islam.&lt;ref name="Puskar2010"/&gt; However, vegetarianism continued amongst some of the Indian Christians, and an estimated 8% of the contemporary Christians in India don't eat meat including that sourced from cattle.

===Mughal Empire===
Cattle slaughter, in accordance with the Islamic custom, was practiced in the Mughal Empire under its [[Sunni]] rulers with a few exceptions. The religiously liberal emperor [[Akbar]], out of respect for the demographic majority of Hindus, criminalized cow slaughtering. In one case, Akbar banished his high official for the offense of cow slaughter.&lt;ref name="Rahman2017p83"/&gt; Later, Aurangzeb lifted this prohibition with his ''Fatawa-i-Alamgiri''. Despite cow slaughter no longer being a crime, states Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman, "no one dared publicly to slaughter cows, particularly in Hindu-dominated areas as people could instantly punish the culprit".&lt;ref name="Rahman2017p83"&gt;{{cite book|author=Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman|title=Criminal Sentencing in Bangladesh: From Colonial Legacies to Modernity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbq8DgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-34193-7|pages=83–85 with footnote 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maratha Empire===
According to Ian Copland and other scholars, the [[Maratha Empire]], which led a Hindu rebellion against the Muslim Mughal Empire and created a Hindu state in the 17th and 18th centuries, respected mosques, mausoleums and Sufi ''pirs''.&lt;ref name="Copland2013p154"/&gt; However, the Maratha polity sharply enforced the Hindu sentiments for cow protection. This may be linked to the [[Bhakti movement]] that developed before the rise of the Maratha Empire, states Copland, where legends and a theology based on the compassion and love stories of Hindu god [[Krishna]], himself a cowherd became integral to regional religiosity.&lt;ref name="Copland2013p154"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ian Copland|author2=Ian Mabbett|author3=Asim Roy et al|title=A History of State and Religion in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWcZulI5tL0C |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45950-4|pages=154–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maratha administration adopted the same approach with Portuguese Christians in the Western Ghats and the peninsular coastal regions. Marathas were liberal, state Copland and others, they respected Christian priests, allowed the building of churches and gave state land to Christian causes.

With the advent of [[British Raj|British rule in India]], eating beef along with drinking whiskey, in English-language colleges in [[Bengal]], became a method of fitting in into the British culture. Some Hindus, in the 1830s, consumed beef to show how they "derided irrational Hindu customs", according to Metcalf and Metcalf.&lt;ref name="Metcalf2012p83"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barbara D.

The reverence for the cow played a role in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] against the [[British East India Company]]. Hindu and Muslim [[sepoy]]s in the army of the East India Company came to believe that their [[paper cartridge]]s, which held a measured amount of [[gunpowder]], were greased with cow and pig fat. The consumption of swine is forbidden in [[Islam]]. Since loading the gun required biting off the end of the paper cartridge, they concluded that the British were forcing them to break edicts of their religion.&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chambers's Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People |year=1891 |author=W. and R.

The [[Arya Samaj]] had a tremendous role in skillfully converting this sentiment into a national movement.&lt;ref name = "Sacred Symbols as Mobilizing Ideology"/&gt;

The first ''Gaurakshini sabha'' (cow protection society) was established in the Punjab in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of an Indian Metropolis, Colonial governance and public culture in Bombay, 1890/1920'', Prashant Kidambi, p. 176, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5612-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement spread rapidly all over [[North India]] and to Bengal, Bombay, Madras presidencies and other [[Central Provinces|central provinces]].  The organization rescued wandering cows and reclaimed them to groom them in places called ''[[Goshala|gaushalas]]'' (cow refuges). Charitable networks developed all through North India to collect rice from individuals, pool the contributions, and re-sell them to fund the ''gaushalas''. Signatures, up to 350,000 in some places, were collected to demand a ban on cow sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Vishnu pp. 67-69"&gt;''Vishnu's crowded temple, India since the great rebellion'', pp. 67-69, Maria Misra, 2008, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-13721-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1880 and 1893, hundreds of ''gaushalas'' were opened.&lt;ref name="ChapISec10"/&gt;

Cow protection sentiment reached its peak in 1893.  Large public meetings were held in [[Nagpur]], [[Haridwar]] and [[Benares]] to denounce beef-eaters. [[Melodramas]] were conducted to display the plight of cows, and pamphlets were distributed, to create awareness among those who sacrificed and ate them. Riots broke out between Hindus and Muslims in [[Mau]] in the [[Azamgarh]] district; it took 3 days for the government to regain control. The rioting was precipitated by contradictory interpretations of a British local magistrate's order.  He had apparently asked all the Muslims interested in cow slaughter to register, which undertaking was in fact performed to identify problem-prone areas. However, Muslims had interpreted this as a promise of protection for those who wanted to perform sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Nationalism, Hindus and Muslims in India'', Peter van der Veer, pp. 92-93, {{ISBN|0-520-08256-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series of violent incidences also resulted in a riot in Bombay involving the working classes, and unrest occurred in places as far away as [[Rangoon, Burma]].  An estimated thirty-one to forty-five [[communal riot]]s broke out over six months and a total of 107 people were killed.&lt;ref name="Vishnu pp. 67-69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Concise History of India, Barbara Daly Metcalf, Thomas R.

[[Queen Victoria]] mentioned the cow protection movement in a letter, dated 8 December 1893, to then [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lansdowne]], writing, "The Queen greatly admired the Viceroy's speech on the Cow-killing agitation. While she quite agrees in the necessity of perfect fairness, she thinks the [[Mohammedan|Muhammadans]] do require more protection than Hindus, and they are decidedly by far the more loyal. Though the Muhammadan's cow-killing is made the pretext for the agitation, it is, in fact, directed against us, who kill far more cows for our army, &amp;c., than the Muhammadans."&lt;ref name="ChapISec10"/&gt;

Cow slaughter was opposed by some prominent leaders of the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]] such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Madan Mohan Malviya]], [[Rajendra Prasad]] and [[Purushottam Das Tandon]].

Gandhi said, "I worship it [cow] and I shall defend its worship against the whole world," and that, "the cow is a poem of pity. One reads pity in the gentle animal. She is the mother to millions of Indian mankind. Protection of the cow means protection of the whole dumb creation of God."&lt;ref name="Gandhi" /&gt; Gandhi considered cow protection as integral to Hindu beliefs, and called "cow protection to me is one of the most wonderful phenomena in human evolution" and "cow protection is the gift of Hinduism to the world, that it is not [[Tilak]] or [[mantra]] or [[caste]] rules that judge Hindus, but "their ability to protect the cow".&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt; According to Gandhi, cow protection means "protection of lives that are helpless and weak in the world". "I would not kill a human being for protection a cow", added Gandhi, and "I will not kill a cow for saving a human life, be it ever so precious".&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt;

On 25 July 1947, in a prayer meeting, Gandhi opposed laws that were derived from religion. He said, "In India no law can be made to ban cow-slaughter. I do not doubt that Hindus are forbidden the slaughter of cows. I have been long pledged to serve the cow but how can my religion also be the religion of the rest of the Indians?

In 1940, one of the Special Committees of the Indian National Congress stated that slaughter of cow and its progeny must be totally prohibited. However, another Committee of the Congress opposed cow slaughter prohibition stating that the skin and leather of cow and its progeny, which is fresh by slaughter should be sold and exported to earn foreign exchange.&lt;ref name = "ChapISec11" /&gt;

In 1944, the British placed restrictions on cattle slaughter in India, on the grounds that the shortage of cattle was causing anxiety to the Government. The shortage itself was attributed to the increased demand for cattle for cultivation, transport, milk and other purposes. It was decided that, in respect of slaughter by the army authorities, working cattle, as well as, cattle fit for bearing offspring, should not be slaughtered. Accordingly, the slaughter of all cattle below 3 years of age, male cattle between 3 and 10 years, female cattle between 3 and 10 years of age, which are capable of producing milk, as well as all cows which are pregnant or in milk, was prohibited.&lt;ref name = "ChapISec11" /&gt;

There was a large increase in the number of cattle slaughtered in the years preceding Independence, according to statistics given by Pandit Thakur Dass, during the debate in the Constituent Assembly on 24 November 1948. The number of oxen killed in 1944 was 6,091,828, while in 1945, sixty five lakhs were slaughtered, an increase of more than 4 lakhs. He further stated that the population of oxen in the country decreased by 37 lakhs in 5 years from 1940 to 1945.&lt;ref name = "ChapISec11"/&gt; However, the figures are much lower according to the Dater Singh Committee Report which states that 2,791,828 and 3,167,496 oxen were slaughtered in 1944 and 1945 respectively.&lt;ref name = "ChapISec12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dahd.nic.in/ch1/chap1.htm#item12 |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter I Annex I (1) |publisher=[[Ministry of Agriculture (India)|DAHD]] |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the British Raj, there were several cases of communal riots caused by the slaughter of cows. A historical survey of some major communal riots, between 1717 and 1977, revealed that out of 167 incidents of [[Religious violence in India|rioting between Hindus and Muslims]], that although in some cases the reasons for provocation of the riots was not given, 22 cases were attributable directly to cow slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banu|first=Zenab|title=Politics of Communalism|pages=175–193|chapter=Appendix IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it10A |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter II (10 A.

===Post-Independence===
The Central Government, in a letter dated 20 December 1950, directed the State Governments not to introduce total prohibition on slaughter, stating, "Hides from slaughtered cattle are much superior to hides from the fallen cattle and fetch a higher price. In the absence of slaughter the best type of hide, which fetches good price in the export market will no longer be available. A total ban on slaughter is thus detrimental to the export trade and work against the interest of the Tanning industry in the country."&lt;ref name="item 13" /&gt;

In 1955, a senior Congress member of parliament [[Seth Govind Das]] drafted a bill for India's parliament for a nationwide ban on cow slaughter, stating that a "large majority of the party" was in favour. India's first Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] opposed this national ban on cow slaughter, and threatened to resign if the elected representatives passed the bill in India's parliament. The bill failed by a vote of 95 to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ls38Az4-J64C&amp;pg=PA160 |title=India and the Politics of Developing Countries: Essays in Memory of Myron Weiner|author = Steven Wilkinson| editor= Myron Weiner, Ashutosh Varshney and Gabriel Almond | year = 2004|publisher=SAGE Publications| isbn=9780761932871| page=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLpRFbLSxvAC&amp;pg=PA117 |title=Votes and Violence: Electoral Competition and Ethnic Riots in India|last=Wilkinson|first=Steven I.|year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=9780521536059| pages=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nehru declared that it was individual states to decide their laws on cow slaughter, states Donald Smith, and criticized the ban on cow slaughter as "a wrong step".&lt;ref name=smith487&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zXWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA487 |title=India as a Secular State|last=Smith|first=Donald Eugene|year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press| isbn=9781400877782| pages= 486–488 }}, Quote: "Although Nehru had declared that this [cow slaughter law] was a matter for the states to decide for themselves, he did not hesitate to criticize the U.P. decision as 'a wrong step'.

All of these governments, of course, have been controlled by the Congress party."&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nehru's opposition was largely irrelevant, states Steven Wilkinson, because under India's Constitution and federal structure laws such as those on cattle slaughter has been an exclusive State subject rather than being a Central subject.

In 1958, a lawsuit was heard in the Supreme Court of India regarding the constitutionality of the slaughter ban laws in the state, where Qureshi petitioned that the laws infringed on Muslim rights to freely practice their religion such as sacrificing cows on Bakr-Id day.&lt;ref name=smith487/&gt; The Court determined that neither the Quran nor the ''Hidaya'' mandates cow slaughter, and the Islamic texts allow a goat or camel be sacrificed instead. Therefore, according to the Court, a total ban on cow slaughter did not infringe on the religious freedom of Muslims under Articles 25 or 48 of its Constitution.&lt;ref name=smith487/&gt;

In 1966, Indian independence activist [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] wrote a letter to then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] calling for a ban on cow slaughter. Narayan wrote, "For myself, I cannot understand why, in a Hindu majority country like India, where rightly or wrongly, there is such a strong feeling about cow-slaughter, there cannot be a legal ban".&lt;ref name="item 13" /&gt; In the same year, the [[1966 anti-cow slaughter agitation|Hindu organisations started an agitation]] demanding a ban on the slaughter of cows.

In July 1995, the Government of India stated before the Supreme Court that, "It is obvious that the Central Government as a whole is encouraging scientific and sustainable development of livestock resources and their efficient utilization which inter-alia includes production of quality meat for export as well as for domestic market. This is being done with a view of increasing the national wealth as well as better returns to the farmer." In recent decades, the Government has started releasing grants and loans for setting up of modern slaughter houses.&lt;ref name="item 13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dahd.nic.in/related-links/chapter-i-introduction|title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter I (13.

Poor hygiene and prevalence of meat-borne disease has been reported in studies of Indian cattle slaughter-houses.

According to media reports, India has numerous illegal slaughterhouses. For example, in the state of Andhra Pradesh, the officials in 2013 reported over 3,000 illegal slaughterhouses.&lt;ref name=nytimes2013/&gt; Cattle are traditionally left to freely roam streets and graze in India. These are easy prey to thieves, state Rosanna Masiola and Renato Tomei.&lt;ref name=tomei45&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosanna Masiola|author2=Renato Tomei|title=Law, Language and Translation: From Concepts to Conflicts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhrGBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-14271-5|pages=43–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The New York Times, the organized mafia gangs pick up the cattle they can find and sell them to these illegal slaughterhouses. These crimes are locally called "cattle rustling" or "cattle lifting".&lt;ref name=nytimes2013&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/world/asia/cow-thefts-on-the-rise-in-india.html For New Breed of Rustlers, Nothing Is Sacred], Gardiner Harris (26 May 2013), The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the cows belong to poor dairy farmers who lack the facility or infrastructure to feed and maintain the cows, and they don't traditionally keep them penned. According to Masiola and Tomei, the increasing meat consumption has led to cows becoming a target for theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rosanna Masiola|author2=Renato Tomei|title=Law, Language and Translation: From Concepts to Conflicts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MhrGBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-14271-5|pages=45}}, Quote: "Increasing meat consumption has meant that holy cows are a target for unscrupulous thieves."&lt;/ref&gt;

The theft of cattle for slaughter and beef production is economically attractive to the mafias in India. In 2013, states Gardiner Harris, a truck can fit 10 cows, each fetching about 5,000 rupees (about US$94 in 2013), or over US$900 per cattle stealing night operation. In a country where some 800 million people live on less than US$2 per day, such theft-based mafia operations are financially attractive.&lt;ref name=nytimes2013/&gt; According to Andrew Buncombe, when smuggled across its border, the price per cattle is nearly threefold higher and the crime is financially more attractive.&lt;ref name=buncombe2012/&gt; Many states have reported rising thefts of cattle and associated violence, according to The Indian Express.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/web-edits/in-assam-mob-fury-and-cattle-thieves-have-a-long-history-4636848/ In Assam, mob fury and cattle thieves have a long history], Samudra Gupta Kashyap (2 May 2017), The Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bangladeshi newspaper ''The Daily Star'', some of cattle theft operations move the cattle stolen in India across the border into [[Bangladesh]], ahead of festivals such as [[Eid-ul-Azha]] when the demand for meat increases. The criminals dye the white or red cows into black, to make identifying the stolen cow difficult. The Border Guard Bangladesh in 2016 reported of confiscating stolen cattle, where some of cattle's original skin color had been "tampered with".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/novel-trick-lift-cattle-1277011 A novel trick to lift cattle], The Daily Star (29 August 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of cows, states the British newspaper ''The Independent'', are illegally smuggled from India into Bangladesh every year to be slaughtered.&lt;ref name=buncombe2012/&gt; Gangs from both sides of the border are involved in this illegal smuggling involving an estimated 1.5 million (15 lakhs) cattle a year, and cattle theft is a source of the supply, states Andrew Buncombe.&lt;ref name=buncombe2012&gt;{{cite web | last=Buncombe | first=Andrew | title=Nothing's sacred: the illegal trade in India's holy cows | website=The Independent | date=1 June 2012 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/nothings-sacred-the-illegal-trade-in-indias-holy-cows-7808483.html | accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zahoor Rather, trade in stolen cattle is one of the important crime-related border issues between India and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;Zahoor A.

=== Castes and religions ===
Some scholars state that the Hindu views on cattle slaughter and beef eating is caste-based, while other scholars disagree. Dalit Hindus eat beef state the former, while the latter state that the position of Dalit Hindus on cattle slaughter is ambiguous.&lt;ref name=lodwick61/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |pages=155–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deryck Lodrick states, for example, “beef-eating is common among low caste Hindus", and vegetarianism is an upper caste phenomenon.&lt;ref name=lodwick61&gt;{{cite journal|title=Symbol and Sustenance: Cattle in South Asian Culture|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|author=Deryck O. Lodrick|volume= 29|issue= 1|pages= 61–84|year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, cow-cherishing, Krishna-worshipping rustic piety, state Susan Bayly and others, has been popular among agriculture-driven, cattle husbandry, farm laboring and merchant castes. These have typically been considered the low-castes in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Bayly2001p83"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Bayly|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC |year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|pages=83–84, 192–194, 209–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bayly, reverence for the cow is widely shared in India across castes. The traditional belief has also associated death or the dead with being unclean, polluting or defiling, such as those who handle corpse, carrion and animal remains.&lt;ref name="Bayly2001p83"/&gt; However, the tradition differentiates between natural or accidental death, and intentional slaughter. According to Frederick J. Simoons, many members of low castes and tribal groups in India reject "cow slaughter and beef eating, some of them quite strongly", while others support beef eating and cattle slaughter.&lt;ref name=simoons110&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick J.

According to Simoons and Lodrick, the reverence for cattle among Hindus, and Indians in general, is more comprehensively understood by considering both the religious dimensions and the daily lives in rural India.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick I. Simoons and Deryck O. Lodrick (1981), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25841764 Background to Understanding the Cattle Situation of India: The Sacred Cow Concept in Hindu Religion and Folk Culture], Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, Bd. 106, H. 1/2, pp. 121-137&lt;/ref&gt; The veneration of cow across various Hindu castes, states Lodrick, emerged with the "fifteenth century revival of Vaishnavism", when god [[Krishna]] along with his cows became a popular object of [[bhakti]] (devotional worship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deryck O. Lodrick|title=Sacred cows, sacred places: origins and survivals of animal homes in India |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-JXX-k034nwC |year= 1981|publisher= University of California Press|isbn= 978-0-520-04109-7|pages= 66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other scholars such as [[J. A. B. van Buitenen]] and Daniel Sheridan state that the theology and the most popular texts related to Krishna, such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' was composed by about 2nd century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Jeaneane Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students, Sussex University Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84519-520-5}}, page xxiv; Quote:"A date of the fifth century BCE is accepted by some, with a later demarcation of the second century BCE, which I think is the more probable."&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' was composed between 500 and 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Sheridan| first=Daniel| title= The Advaitic Theism of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1986 |isbn=81-208-0179-2 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qrtYYTjYFY8C |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=1966 | last=van Buitenen | first=J.

According to [[People's Union for Democratic Rights]] (PUDR), some Dalits work in leather which includes cow-skin and they rely on it for their livelihood. The position of Dalits to cow-protection is highly ambivalent, states PUDR, given their Hindu identity and the "endemic contradiction - between the 'Hindu' ethos of protecting the cow and a trade dependent fundamentally on the skin of cows".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selling of old cattle for skin, according to them, is supported by members of both "dominant and subordinate castes" for the leather-related economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year= 2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |page=155}}, Quote: "The practice of selling off ageing and sick and dry cows is something the dominant and subordinate castes have historically practiced".&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant groups, officials and even some Dalits state that "Dalits are cow-protectors". The inclusion of Dalits in cow-protection ideology, according to PUDR, is accompanied by "avowal of loyalty to cow-protection" exposing the fragility of the cow-protection ideology across castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Dalit student associations in the [[Hyderabad]] region state that beef preparations, such as ''beef biriyani'', is the traditional food of low-castes. Historical evidence does not support this claim, state Claude Levy-Straus and Brigitte Sebastia. Beef as the traditional food of impoverished Dalits is a reconstruction of history and Indian beef dishes are a Mughal era innovation and more recently invented tradition. It is the nineteenth century politics that has associated beef and cattle slaughter with Muslim and Dalit identity, states Sebastia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brigitte Sebastia|title=Eating Traditional Food: Politics, Identity and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TMlDwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-28594-6|pages=10–11, 116–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic imperative ===
According to [[Marvin Harris]], the importance of cattle to Hindus and other religious groups is beyond religion, because the cattle has been and remains an important pillar of rural economy.&lt;ref name=harris28/&gt; In the traditional economy, states Harris, a team of oxen is "Indian peasant's tractor, thresher and family car combined", and the cow is the factory that produces those oxen.&lt;ref name=harris28/&gt;{{refn|group=note|In rice-growing regions, buffalo is important because buffalo pull better in water-filled muddy soils.&lt;ref name=harris28/&gt;}} The cattle produce nutritious milk, their dung when dried serves as a major cooking fuel, and for the poor the cattle is an essential partner in many stages of agriculture. When cattle fall sick, the family worries over them like Westerners do over their pets or family members. A natural loss of a cattle from untimely death can cripple a poor family, and thus slaughtering a creature so useful and essential is unthinkable. According to Harris, India's unpredictable monsoons and famines over its history meant even greater importance of cattle, because Indian breeds of cattle can survive with little food and water for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=harris28/&gt;

According to Britha Mikkelsen and other scholars, cow dung produced by young and old cattle is the traditional cooking fuel as dung-cakes and fertilizer in India. The recycling substitutes over {{Convert|25000000|t|LT|lk=on}} of fossil fuels or {{Convert|60000000|t|LT}} of wood every year, providing the majority of cooking fuel needs in rural India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Britha Mikkelsen|title=Methods for Development Work and Research: A New Guide for Practitioners|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SIVdugYuwOIC |year= 2005|publisher= SAGE Publications|isbn= 978-0-7619-3328-1|page= 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Bonnie Kime Scott|author2= Susan E.

Henslin|title=Down to Earth Sociology: 14th Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF2f9ndR__gC |year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-3620-8|pages=465–466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian religions adapted to the rural economic constraints, states Harris. Preserving cattle by opposing slaughter has been and remains an economic necessity and an insurance for the impoverished.&lt;ref name=harris28&gt;[[Marvin Harris]] (1978), India's sacred cow, ''Human Nature'', 1(2), 28–36&lt;/ref&gt; The cow is sacred in India, states Harris, not because of superstitious, capricious and ignorant beliefs, but because of real economic imperatives and cattle's role in the Indian tradition of integrated living. Cattle became essential in India, just like dogs or cars became essential in other human cultures, states Harris.&lt;ref name=harris28/&gt;

=== Animal cruelty ===
The slaughterhouses in India have been accused of cruelty against animals by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] and other animal-rights groups.&lt;ref name=cruelty2/&gt; According to PETA and these groups, the slaughterhouse workers slit animals’ throats with dull blades and let them bleed to death. Cattle are skinned and dismembered while they’re still alive and in full view of other animals.&lt;ref name=cruelty2/&gt;

The Supreme Court of India, in February 2017, ordered a state governments to stop the illegal slaughterhouses and set up enforcement committees to monitor the treatment of animals used for meat and leather.&lt;ref name=cruelty2/&gt; The Court has also ruled that the Indian Constitution requires Indian citizens to show compassion to the animal kingdom, respect the fundamental rights of animals, and asked the states to prevent cruelty to animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sc-stays-hc-judgment-on-cow-slaughter/articleshow/56742659.cms Supreme Court stays high court judgment on cow slaughter], The Times of India (Jan 24, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vigilantism ===
According to Judith Walsh, widespread cow protection riots occurred repeatedly in [[British India]] in the 1880s and 1890s. These were observed in regions of [[Punjab]], [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], Bihar, [[Bengal]], [[Bombay Presidency]] and in parts of South [[Myanmar]] (Rangoon). The anti-Cow Killing riots of 1893 in Punjab caused the death of at least 100 people.&lt;ref name=yang576&gt;{{cite journal | last=Yang | first=Anand A. | title=Sacred Symbol and Sacred Space in Rural India: Community Mobilization in the “Anti-Cow Killing” Riot of 1893 | journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=04 | year=1980 | doi=10.1017/s0010417500009555 | pages=576–596}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Judith&gt;{{cite book|author=Judith E.

According to Mark Doyle, the first cow protection societies on the Indian subcontinent were started by Kukas of [[Sikhism]] (also called Namdharis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Doyle|title=Communal Violence in the British Empire: Disturbing the Pax|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QK2tDAAAQBAJ|year =2016|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic Publishing|isbn=978-1-4742-6826-4|pages=249 note 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sikh Kukas or Namdharis were agitating for cow protection after the British annexed Punjab. In 1871, states Peter van der Veer, Sikhs killed Muslim butchers of cows in [[Amritsar]] and [[Ludhiana]], and viewed cow protection as a "sign of the moral quality of the state".&lt;ref name="Veer1994p90"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter van der Veer|title=Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p29ArJ7j6zgC|year=1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08256-4|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barbara Metcalf and Thomas Metcalf, Sikhs were agitating for the well-being of cows in the 1860s, and their ideas spread to Hindu reform movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barbara D.

Cow slaughter in contemporary India has triggered riots and violent vigilante groups.&lt;ref name=yang576/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Robb | first=Peter | title=The Challenge of Gau Mata: British Policy and Religious Change in India, 1880–1916 | journal=Modern Asian Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press| volume=20 | issue=02 | year=1986 | doi=10.1017/s0026749x00000846 | pages=285–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/27/india-cow-protection-spurs-vigilante-violence India: ‘Cow Protection’ Spurs Vigilante Violence: Prosecute Assailants, Protect Targeted Minorities], Human Rights Watch (27 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to PUDR, the VHP, a Hindu group, and the Gauraksha Samiti have defended violent vigilantism around cow protection as sentiments against the "sin of cow-slaughter" and not related to "the social identity of the victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |page=155}}, Quote: "It needs to be recalled that the very first response of the VHP and the Gauraksha Samiti was to glorify the killings as just retribution for the sin of cow-slaughter. The social identity of the victims appeared unimportant, except that they were possibly cow-slaughterers".&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups, such as the families of Dalits who were victims of a mob violence linked to cow-slaughter in 2002, did not question the legitimacy of cow protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |pages=155}}, Quote: "Noticeably none of the groups concerned, including the state, disputed that the response of the mob was a completely understandable response to cow-slaughter. The emphasis was rather on the truth value of the allegation itself. It is evident that the issue of cow-protection is central to an understanding of the incident."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Human Rights Watch]], the post-2014 violence has included instances of assault, harassment, extortion, and it has targeted Muslims and lower-caste Hindus.{{cn|date=November 2017}} According to a Reuters report, citing IndiaSpend analysis, a total of "44 Indians – 39 of them Muslims – have been killed and 124 injured", between 2010 and June 2018 in cow-related violence.&lt;ref name=reuters20102017&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/india-protests-muslims-beef-idINKBN19J2BV|title=Protests held across India after attacks against Muslims|work=Reuters|date=28 June 2017|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Preservation, protection and improvement of stock and prevention of animal diseases, veterinary training and practice" is Entry 15 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, meaning that State Legislatures have exclusive powers to legislate the prevention of slaughter and preservation of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vakilbabu.com/Laws/SubList/SList.htm |title=The States Subjects List |publisher=Vakilbabu.com |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/shed07.htm |title=Seventh Schedule |publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prohibition of cow slaughter is also one of the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Article 48 of the Constitution. It reads, "The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall, in particular, take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of India - Part IV|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/Const.Pock%202Pg.Rom8Fsss%287%29.pdf|work=[[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Ministry of Law and Justice]]|accessdate=8 November 2013|page=21}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Muslims of Bihar petitioned the Supreme Court of India that the ban on cow slaughter violated their religious right. The Court unanimously rejected their claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ian Copland|author2=Ian Mabbett|author3=Asim Roy, Kate Brittlebank and Adam Bowles|title=A History of State and Religion in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWcZulI5tL0C&amp;pg=PA238| year=2013|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-1-136-45950-4|pages =237–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several cases, such as ''Mohd. Hanif Qureshi v. State of Bihar'' (AIR 1959 SCR 629), ''Hashumatullah v. State of Madhya Pradesh'', ''Abdul Hakim and others v. State of Bihar'' (AIR 1961 SC 448) and ''Mohd. Faruk v. State of Madhya Pradesh'', the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] has held that, "A total ban [on cattle slaughter] was not permissible if, under economic conditions, keeping useless bull or bullock be a burden on the society and therefore not in the public interest."&lt;ref name="ChapISec8"/&gt; The clause "under economic conditions, keeping useless (...)" has been studied by the Animal Welfare Board of India which determined that the fuel made from cow dung for household cooking purposes in the Indian society suggests that the cattle is never useless while it produces dung.&lt;ref name="ChapISec8"/&gt;

In May 2016, [[Bombay High Court]] gave the judgement that consumption or possession of beef is legal under Article 21 of [[Constitution of India]], but upheld the ban on cow slaughter in the state of Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/cow-slaughter-not-allowed-but-beef-lovers-can-eat-meat-in-maharashtra/story-K5v2Cggb25sHSJATE6R4gN.html|title=Bombay HC says eating beef legal, upholds ban on cow slaughter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/beef-ban-maharashtra-high-court-verdict-government-2787769/|title=Can eat, possess beef got from outside state: Bombay High Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court of India heard a case between 2004 and 2017. The case petitioned the Court to order a ban on the common illegal treatment of animals during transport and slaughter. In February 2017, the Court ordered a state governments to stop the illegal slaughterhouses and set up enforcement committees to monitor the treatment of animals used for meat and leather.&lt;ref name=cruelty2&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/animals-on-way-to-slaughterhouse-treated-inhumaly/articleshow/59078137.cms Animals on way to slaughterhouse treated inhumanly], Vijay V Singh, The Times of India (10 June 2017);&lt;br&gt;[http://www.petaindia.com/media/peta-calls-states-stop-illegal-slaughter-animals-per-supreme-court-order/ PETA Calls on all States to Stop Illegal Slaughter of Animals as Per Supreme Court Order], Nikunj Sharma and Shambhavi Tiwari, PETA India (31 March 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court has also ruled, according to a Times of India report, that "it was evident from the combined reading of Articles 48 and 51- A(g) of the [Indian] Constitution that citizens must show compassion to the animal kingdom. The animals have their own fundamental rights. Article 48 specifically lays down that the state shall endeavour to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, other milch and draught cattle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sc-stays-hc-judgment-on-cow-slaughter/articleshow/56742659.cms Supreme Court stays high court judgment on cow slaughter], The Times of India (24 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-uniformity===
No state law explicitly bans the consumption of beef. There is a lack of uniformity among State laws governing cattle slaughter. The strictest laws are in Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, where the slaughter of cow and its progeny, including bulls and bullocks of all ages, is completely banned.  Most States prohibit the slaughter of cows of all ages. However, Assam and West Bengal permit the slaughter of cows of over the ages of 10 and 14 years, respectively. Most States prohibit the slaughter of calves, whether male or female. With the exception of Bihar and Rajasthan, where age of a calf is given as below 3 years, the other States have not defined the age of a calf. According to the National Commission on Cattle, the definition of a calf being followed in Maharashtra, by some executive instructions, was "below the age of 1 year".&lt;ref name="Chapter 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dahd.nic.in/ch2/chap2.htm|title=Chapter II  Executive Summary|accessdate=26 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408235732/http://dahd.nic.in/ch2/chap2.htm#|archive-date=8 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dahd.nic.in/ch4/chap4.htm|title=Chapter IV  Legislation, Part I|accessdate=26 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314202637/http://dahd.nic.in/ch4/chap4.htm#|archive-date=14 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Daman and Diu, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand violation of State laws on cattle slaughter are both [[cognizable offence|cognizable]] and non-bailable offences. Most of other States specify that offences would be cognizable only. The maximum term of imprisonment varies from 6 months to 14 years(life-term) and the fine from {{INR}}1,000 to {{INR}}5,00,000. Delhi and Madhya Pradesh have fixed a [[mandatory minimum]] term of imprisonment at 6 months.

Cows are routinely shipped to states with lower or no requirement for slaughter, even though it is illegal in most states to ship animals across state borders to be slaughtered.&lt;ref name="MP goes tough on cow slaughter"&gt;{{cite news|title=MP goes tough on cow slaughter|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-04/india/30588595_1_animal-preservation-act-jail-term-cow-slaughter-prohibition|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME Asia"&gt;{{Cite news | first=Maseeh | last=Rahman | title=Is Nothing Sacred? | date=29 May 2000 | url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0529/india.cows.html | work=Time Asia | accessdate=25 February 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928072438/http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0529/india.cows.html# | archive-date=28 September 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many illegal [[slaughterhouse]]s operate in large cities such as [[Chennai]] and [[Mumbai]].

===Legislative history===

====Constituent Assembly====
After India attained Independence, the members of the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]], a body consisting of indirectly elected representatives set up for the purpose of drafting a constitution for India, debated the question of making a provision for the protection and preservation of the cow in the Constitution of India. An amendment for including a provision in the Directive Principles of State Policy as Article 38A was introduced by Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava. The amendment read, "The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall in particular take steps for preserving and improving the breeds of cattle and prohibit the slaughter of cow and other useful cattle, specially milch and draught cattle and their young stock".&lt;ref name="section 11" /&gt;

Another amendment motion was moved by [[Seth Govind Das]], who sought to extend the scope of the provisions for prohibiting slaughter to cover cow and its progeny by adding the following words at the end of Bhargava's amendment, "'The word "cow' includes bulls, bullocks, young stock of genus cow". Bhargava's amendment was passed by the Constituent Assembly, but Das' was rejected.&lt;ref name="section 11" /&gt;

Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava ([[East Punjab]]), Seth Govind Das ([[Central Provinces and Berar]]), Shibban Lal Saksena ([[United Provinces (1937–50)|United Provinces]]), Ram Sahai (United State of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]]-[[Indore State|Indore]]-[[Malwa Agency|Malwa:]] [[Madhya Bharat|Madhya]] [[Madhya Bharat|Bharat]]), [[Raghu Vira]] (Central Provinces and Berar) and [[Raghunath Vinayak Dhulekar]] (United Provinces) strongly pleaded for the inclusion of a provision in the Constitution for prohibiting the slaughter of cows. Although some members were keen on including the provision in the chapter on [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Rights]] but, later as a compromise and on the basis of an assurance given by [[B. R. Ambedkar|Dr. B. R. Ambedkar]], the amendment was moved for inclusion as a Directive Principle of State Policy.&lt;ref name="section 11" /&gt;

Bhargava stated that "While moving this amendment, I have no hesitation in stating that for people like me and those that do not agree with the point of view of Dr. Ambedkar and others, this entails, in a way, a sort of sacrifice. Seth Govind Das had sent one such amendment to be included in the Fundamental Rights and other members also had sent similar amendments. To my mind, it would have been much better if this could have been incorporated in the Fundamental Rights, but some of my Assembly friends differed and it is the desire of Dr. Ambedkar that this matter, instead of being included in Fundamental Rights should be incorporated in the Directive Principles. As a matter of fact, it is the agreed opinion of the Assembly that this problem should be solved in such a manner that the objective is gained without using any sort of coercion. I have purposely adopted this course, as to my mind, the amendment fulfills our object and is midway between the Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights." Bhargava also observed that "I do not want that, due to its inclusion in the Fundamental Rights, non-[[Hindu]]s should complain that they have been forced to accept a certain thing against their will." The end result of the debate in the Constituent Assembly was that the Bhargava's amendment was carried and the Article in its present form exists as Article 48 of the Constitution, as one of the Directive Principles of State Policy.&lt;ref name="section 11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it11 |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter II (11.

====Parliament====
A number of Private Member’s Bills and Resolutions regarding the prevention of cow slaughter have been introduced in both Houses of Parliament, from time to time. However, none have been successful in obtaining a complete nationwide ban on cow slaughter. Attempts to address the issue through a central legislation or otherwise are described below.&lt;ref name="Section 13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it13|title=Chapter II, Executive Summary, Section 13|publisher=Government of India|access-date=18 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109002416/http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it13#it13|archive-date=9 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vinoba Bhave]] went on an indefinite fast from 22 April 1979 demanding that the Governments of West Bengal and Kerala agree to enact legislation banning cow slaughter. On 12 April 1979, a Private Members Resolution was passed in the Lok Sabha, by 42 votes to 8, with 12 absentees. It read, "This House directs the Government to ensure total ban on the slaughter of cows of all ages and calves in consonance with the Directive Principles laid down in Article 48 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court, as well as necessitated by strong economic considerations based on the recommendations of the Cattle Preservation and Development Committee and the reported fast by Acharya Vinoba Bhave from 21st April, 1979".&lt;ref name="Section 12" /&gt;

Then Prime Minister [[Morarji Desai]] later announced in Parliament that the government would initiate action for amending the Constitution with a view to conferring legislative competence on the Union Parliament for legislating on the subject of cow protection. Accordingly, a Constitution Amendment Bill seeking to bring the subject of prevention of cow slaughter on to the [[Concurrent List]] was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 18 May 1979. The Bill, however, lapsed on account of dissolution of the Sixth Lok Sabha. Bhave reiterated his demand for a total ban on cow slaughter in July 1980, while addressing the All India Goseva Sammelan. He also requested that cows should not be taken from one State to another.&lt;ref name="Section 12" /&gt;

In 1981, the question of amending the Constitution by introducing a Bill was again examined by the Government, but, in view of the sensitive nature of the issue and owing to political compulsions a "wait and watch" policy was adopted. A number of complaints were received from time to time that despite the ban on the slaughter of cow and its progeny, healthy bullocks were being slaughtered under one pretext or the other and calves were being maimed, so that they could be declared useless and ultimately slaughtered.&lt;ref name="Section 12"/&gt;

Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], in her letter dated 24 February 1982 wrote to the Chief Ministers of 14 States viz. Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir, in which she desired that the ban be enforced in letter and spirit, that the ban on cow slaughter is not allowed to be circumvented by devious methods, and that Committees to inspect cattle before they are admitted to slaughter houses be adopted.&lt;ref name="Section 12"/&gt;

Recognizing that the problem basically arose on account of inaction or obstruction on the part of a few States and large scale smuggling of cows and calves from a prohibition State to a non-prohibition State like Kerala was taking place, a suggestion was made that this problem be brought to the notice of the [[Sarkaria Commission]], which was making recommendations regarding Centre-State relations, but this idea was dropped as the Commission was then in the final stages of report-writing.&lt;ref name="Section 12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it12 |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter II (12.

==Legislation by State or Union Territory==
===Andhra Pradesh===
''The Andhra Pradesh Prohibition of Cow Slaughter and Animal Preservation Act, 1977'' governs the slaughter of cattle (cows and buffaloes) in the state. In the case of cows, the law makes a distinction between males and females. The slaughter of female cows and of heifers is totally forbidden. The slaughter of bulls and bullocks is permitted upon obtaining a "fit-for-slaughter" certificate, to be issued only if the animal is "not economical or is not likely to become economical for the purpose of breeding or draught/agricultural operations." The certificate can be issued by any veterinary doctor and is a source of much corruption and misuse. The law also prohibits the slaughter of calves, whether male or female. The age limit of "calf" is not defined.

In the case of buffaloes, the law firstly forbits in absolute terms the slaughter of calves, whether male or female. Again, the age limit of "calf" is not defined and therefore there is much misuse, resulting in the slaughter of many young male animals who are only a few months old. Secondly, the law forbids the slaughter of adult buffaloes unless a "fit-for-slaughter" certificate is issued by a veterinarian. The ceretificate can be issued if the animal is deemed "uneconomical for purposes of milking, breeding or draught/agricultural operations." Thus, the law permits the slaughter of all adult male buffaloes and of all old and "spent" female buffaloes whose milk yield is not economical. For this reason, the slaughter of buffaloes, both male and female, is rampant in Andhra Pradesh.

Anyone violating the law can be punished with imprisonment up to maximum of 6 months or fine of up to {{INR}}1,000 or both. The crime is treated as a [[cognizable offence]].&lt;ref name="ANNEX II (8)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary/annex-ii-8.aspx |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - ANNEX II (8) Gist of State Legislations on Cow Slaughter |publisher=[[Ministry of Agriculture (India)|DAHD]] |accessdate=8 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185034/http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary/annex-ii-8.aspx |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cerro Ñielol Natural Monument''' is a hill belonging to the Intermediate Depression and is located in the urban area of the city of [[Temuco]], Province of Cautín, [[Araucanía Region]], Chile.

With a height of 115 and 335 m, the latter is the highest point of the city. On 89 acres a large variety of flora and fauna of the Valdivian temperate forest ecoregion can be seen, as well as important historical and cultural landmarks of Temuco. Its main entrance is along Avenida Arturo Prat (one of the main Temuco streets) and is seven blocks away from the main square Plaza de Armas. Because of its natural landscape and several viewpoints, the monument is one of the main tourist areas of the city. Cultural events are usually held at the top of the monument.

The [[Southern Andean Volcano Observatory]] is located at the hill, due to its good outlook on several volcanoes including [[Llaima]] volcano.

The hill was originally named "National Tourism Park Cerro Ñielol". The Society of the Friends of the tree (founded by Luis Picasso Vallebuona) purchased the lands of the hill to reforest and protect it. Later it was reclassified as the National Park Natural Monument by Supreme Decree No. 617 of the Ministry of National Assets on December 3, 1987. Nowadays it is a protected area administrated by the Chilean state. It can be visited by car or foot all year round.

'''Charles A. Lindbergh State Park''' is a 569-acre (2.3&amp;nbsp;km²) [[Minnesota]] [[List of Minnesota state parks|state park]] on the outskirts of [[Little Falls, Minnesota|Little Falls]]. The park was once the farm of Congressman [[Charles August Lindbergh]] and his son [[Charles Lindbergh]], the famous aviator. Their restored 1906 house and two other farm buildings are within the park boundaries. The house, a [[National Historic Landmark]], and an adjacent museum are operated by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]], known as the Charles Lindbergh House and Museum. Three buildings and three structures built by the [[Works Progress Administration]] in the 1930s were named to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. These buildings include a picnic shelter and a water tower, built in the [[National Park Service Rustic|Rustic Style]] from local stone and logs, and have remained relatively unchanged since construction. Although the property includes shoreline on the [[Mississippi River]], the Lindbergh family requested that the park not include intensive use areas for swimming or camping, so development was kept to a minimum.

==History==
Charles August Lindbergh, known as C.A., was a prominent lawyer and real estate trader in Little Falls.  In March 1901 he married Evangeline Lodge Land, the college-educated descendant of two notable Detroit medical families, who had come to Little Falls the previous autumn as a teacher. She, C.A., and his two daughters from a previous marriage moved to a property, which C.A. had purchased for a dairy farm three years earlier. They had a three-story house built on the bluff overlooking the Mississippi River. A tenant's house was built across the road for the farm workers. Charles Augustus Lindbergh was born in 1902, and would be the couple's only child. A barn was built later that year, and the farm was populated with cattle, goats, hogs, sheep, chickens, and pigeons as well as cats and dogs.

On August 5, 1905 a fire started for unknown reasons on the third floor. The house burned down to its stone foundation, but the Lindberghs and their servants escaped injury and managed to save many of the household items. The Lindberghs had a new house built on the foundation of the first. However it was much smaller, due to C.A.'s overextended finances and a growing strain in the marriage. The new house fit awkwardly onto the footprint of the old, necessitating a short hallway with seven doors leading off. The basement, intended as a library for C.A., and the upper floor was never finished. Instead, C.A. entered politics and in 1907 began serving the first of five consecutive terms in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. For the next decade the younger Charles spent much of each year in Detroit and Washington, D.C., leaving only two or three months at the house in Little Falls. However, Charles would credit his time spent on the farm and playing along the Mississippi for his strength and self-reliance. The unfinished upper floor became Charles' exclusive play area, and upon hearing an unusually loud engine one day in 1911 he climbed out onto the roof and saw his first airplane.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Charles Lindbergh House|url={{NHLS url|id=70000303}} |format=pdf|author=Cathy Alexander |date=February 1976 |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=70000303|title=Accompanying 3 images|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(976&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evangeline's relationship with C.A. and his daughters worsened, and in 1917 she and Charles moved back into the house year-round. Charles continued sleeping in his bedroom, which was really a screened-in porch, on all but the very coldest winter nights. He began overseeing the farm and was an early adopter of mechanization technology. Charles left in 1920 to attend college and returned only once, in 1923, arriving in his [[Curtiss JN-4]] plane and landing in a field on the west side of the property. In the next two years the barn burned down and C.A. died, and the farm was largely neglected. After Charles Lindbergh became famous in 1927, souvenir seekers frequently broke into the empty house and caused extensive damage.

Encouraged by locals hoping to see the house protected, the Lindbergh family donated the {{convert|110|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm to the state of Minnesota in 1931 as a park in memory of C.A. The family worked with the [[Minnesota Historical Society]] to restore the home, and donated many original furnishings. The Works Progress Administration developed the park for recreation.  In 1969 the house and its grounds were transferred to the [[Minnesota Historical Society]]. In what was to be his final public address, Charles spoke from the porch of his boyhood home at the 1973 grand opening of an adjacent interpretive center. He died the following year. The visitor center initially focused on the three generations of Lindberghs in America, at the request of the spotlight-leery Charles. However, a 2002 remodeling doubled the exhibit space and added more about the aviator himself.

In 1989 the WPA developments were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a {{convert|9|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]]. The district contains six [[contributing properties]]—two buildings (a picnic shelter and latrine), two structures (the water tower and a retaining wall along Pike Creek), and two objects (drinking fountains near the picnic shelter). All were built between 1938 and 1939. They are considered historically significant as examples of [[New Deal]] federal work relief and Minnesota's state park development, and architecturally significant for their [[National Park Service rustic]] design. The same picnic shelter design was used in [[Lake Bemidji State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Rolf T. |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Charles A.

==Park grounds==
The land is glacial [[till]] deposited between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago. [[Slate]] boulders carried in by glaciers from farther north are visible in the bed of Pike Creek. The vegetation remains similar to its pre-settlement composition of pine forest with oak and prairie openings. Damming has raised the water level of the Mississippi substantially from the days when Charles Lindbergh swam in it.

The park has a campground with 38 sites, 15 of those with electrical hookups. There is also a group campsite that accommodates up to 30 people, one walk-in campsite, and a canoe-in site along the Mississippi River.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="716">The '''chemical equator''' concept was coined in 2008 when researchers from [[University of York]] discovered a distinct divide between the polluted air over Indonesia from the largely uncontaminated atmosphere over Australia.

The divide of the [[atmosphere]] of the [[northern hemisphere]] from the atmosphere of the [[southern hemisphere]] is different from that of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080923091339.htm|title=  Chemical Equator' Discovery Will Aid Pollution Mapping}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Citizenfour''''' is a 2014 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Laura Poitras]], concerning [[Edward Snowden]] and the [[NSA spying scandal]]. The film had its US premiere on October 10, 2014, at the [[New York Film Festival]] and its UK premiere on October 17, 2014, at the [[BFI London Film Festival]]. The film features Snowden and [[Glenn Greenwald]], and was co-produced by Poitras, [[Mathilde Bonnefoy]], and [[Dirk Wilutzky]], with [[Steven Soderbergh]] and others serving as [[executive producer]]s. ''Citizenfour'' received critical acclaim upon release, and was the recipient of numerous accolades, including the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[87th Academy Awards|2015 Oscars]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:CITIZENFOUR (2014) trailer.webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=1:05|Shot from the film trailer for ''Citizenfour'']]
In January 2013, [[Laura Poitras]], an American documentary film director/producer who had been working for several years on a film about monitoring programs in the United States that were the result of the [[September 11 attacks]], receives an encrypted e-mail from a stranger who calls himself, "Citizenfour."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/snowdens-first-emails-to-poitras/|title=These Are the Emails Snowden Sent to First Introduce His Epic NSA Leaks|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he offers her inside information about illegal [[wiretapping]] practices of the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and other intelligence agencies. In June 2013, accompanied by investigative journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'' intelligence reporter [[Ewen MacAskill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2014/05/edward-snowden-politics-interview|title=The Snowden Saga: A Shadowland of Secrets and Light|author1=Suzanna Andrews|author2=Bryan Burrough|author3=Sarah Ellison|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; she travels to Hong Kong with her camera for the first meeting with the stranger in a hotel, who reveals himself as [[Edward Snowden]]. Scenes of their meeting take place in Snowden's hotel room, where he maintains his privacy. Shots of Snowden in his bed, in front of his mirror and of the hotel from a distance  form the character of Snowden as a trapped political agent.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keenan, “Windows: of Vulnerability,” Ed. Bruce Robbins, The Phantom Public Sphere (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press,1997), 121-141&lt;/ref&gt;

After four days of interviews, on June 9, Snowden's identity is made public at his request. As media outlets begin to discover his location at [[The Mira Hong Kong]], Snowden relocates to Poitras' room in an attempt to elude phone calls made to his room. Facing potential extradition and prosecution in the United States, Snowden schedules a meeting with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] and applies for refugee status. After Poitras believes she is being followed, she leaves Hong Kong for Berlin.

On June 21, the US government requests the Hong Kong government extradite Snowden. Snowden manages to depart from Hong Kong, but his US passport is cancelled before he can connect to Havana, stranding him in the [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] in Moscow. On August 1, 2013, the Russian government grants Snowden temporary asylum for a period of one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chumley|first1=Cheryl|last2=Sherfinski|first2=David|title=Edward Snowden granted asylum in Russia, leaves airport|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/1/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-granted-asylum-ru/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Greenwald returns to his home in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and speaks publicly about United States' utilization of NSA programs for foreign surveillance. Greenwald and Poitras maintain a correspondence wherein they both express reluctance to return to the United States.

Throughout, the film offers smaller vignettes that precede and follow Snowden's Hong Kong interviews, including [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]] speaking about NSA programs, and eventually testifying before the German Parliament regarding [[German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal|NSA spying in Germany.]]

The film closes with Greenwald, Snowden and Poitras meeting once again, this time in Russia. Greenwald and Snowden discuss new emerging details on US intelligence programs, careful to only write down and not speak critical pieces of information. Greenwald tears these documents creating a pile of scraps, before slowly removing them from the table.

== Background on Snowden ==
[[File:Edward Snowden 2013-10-9 (1) (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|Edward Snowden, October 2013.]]
Born on June 21, 1983 in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]], Edward Snowden first became involved with the United States government upon his enrollment in the [[Army Reserves]] in the spring of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/edward-snowden-21262897|title=Edward Snowden|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden claims to have left the program after a few months because he broke his legs in a training accident while a US House of Representatives report claims he had shin splints&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Executive Summary of Review of the Unauthorized Disclosures of Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward Snowden|last=|first=|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives|year=2016|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He then began working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 2006 and was stationed with diplomatic cover by agency in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]] in 2007. After nearly three years with the agency, Snowden resigned his position in February 2009 in order to begin working for a contractor for the [[National Security Agency|NSA]]. It was at this point in his career that Snowden could sense that his views were changing; "I watched as Obama advanced the very policies that I thought would be reigned in ... [The NSA] are intent on making every conversation and every form of behaviour in the world known to them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/01/edward-snowden-intelligence-leak-nsa-contractor-extract|title=How Edward Snowden went from loyal NSA contractor to whistleblower|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=2014-02-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Snowden was reassigned from his base in Japan to a base in Honolulu, Hawaii, working for a variety of different contractors before serving as a consultant to [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/edward-snowden-timeline-n114871|title=Edward Snowden: A Timeline - NBC News|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In his own words, the longer he continued to work for the NSA, the more he "worked in secret to resist" his own feelings regarding the various programs in place at the agency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/edward-snowden-says-motive-behind-leaks-was-to-expose-surveillance-state/2013/06/09/aa3f0804-d13b-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html|title=Edward Snowden says motive behind leaks was to expose ‘surveillance state’|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He had served at the Hawaiian base for approximately 15 months prior to leaving the United States and leaking thousands of classified documents. 

==Production==
By 2012, Poitras had begun work on the third film in her 9/11 trilogy, which she intended to focus broadly on the topic of domestic [[surveillance]] for which she interviewed Assange, Greenwald, Binney, and Appelbaum.&lt;ref name="Packer 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Packer|first1=George|authorlink1=George Packer|title=Laura Poitras's closeup view of Edward Snowden.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/20/holder-secrets|accessdate=December 12, 2014|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was first contacted by Snowden in January 2013 after he was unable to establish encrypted communications with Greenwald.&lt;ref name="Lapin 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lapin|first1=Andrew |title='Citizenfour' Follows The Snowden Story Without (Much) Grandstanding |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/24/356100779/citizenfour-follows-the-snowden-story-without-much-grandstanding|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=December 12, 2014|date=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/05/excerpt-glenn-greenwalds-no-place-to-hide/ |title=Excerpt: Glenn Greenwald's 'No Place to Hide'|first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |publisher=ABC News}} {{Dead link |date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She flew to Hong Kong in late May 2013, where over the course of eight days she filmed Snowden in his hotel room&lt;ref name="Packer 2014"/&gt; at the [[The Mira Hong Kong|Mira Hotel]] in Hong Kong.

Ronnie Scheib of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote "No amount of familiarity with whistleblower Edward Snowden and his shocking revelations of the U.S. government's wholesale spying on its own citizens can prepare one for the impact of Laura Poitras's extraordinary documentary ''Citizenfour''... far from reconstructing or analyzing a fait accompli, the film tersely records the deed in real time, as Poitras and fellow journalist Glenn Greenwald meet Snowden over an eight-day period in a Hong Kong hotel room to plot how and when they will unleash the bombshell that shook the world. Adapting the cold language of data encryption to recount a dramatic saga of abuse of power and justified paranoia, Poitras brilliantly demonstrates that information is a weapon that cuts both ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-citizenfour-1201327600/

Spencer Ackerman writes in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "''Citizenfour'' must have been a maddening documentary to film. Its subject is pervasive global surveillance, an enveloping digital act that spreads without visibility, so its scenes unfold in courtrooms, hearing chambers and hotels. Yet the virtuosity of Laura Poitras, its director and architect, makes its 114 minutes crackle with the nervous energy of revelation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/11/citizenfour-review-snowden-vindicated-poitras-nsa-journalism | title=''Citizenfour'' Review&amp;nbsp;– Poitras' Victorious Film Shows Snowden Vindicated | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=October 11, 2014 | accessdate=October 11, 2014 | last=Ackerman | first=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In December 2014, retired naval officer and oil executive Horace Edwards of Kansas filed suit against the film's producers "on behalf of the American people" for aiding and abetting Snowden's leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The Academy rejected the claim, noting that "the ''Guardian'' interview appears in less than two minutes of the documentary", and ruled that ''Citizenfour'' was eligible for Oscar consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-rejects-challenge-citizenfour-oscar-759987 |title=Academy Rejects Challenge to ''Citizenfour'' Oscar Eligibility |first=Scott|last=Feinberg |date=December 23, 2014 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the filmmakers asked the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas]] to dismiss the lawsuit on standing and jurisdictional grounds, and on [[First Amendment]] grounds citing ''[[Bartnicki v. Vopper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/citizenfour-filmmakers-demand-end-lawsuit-772519|title='Citizenfour' Filmmakers Demand End to Lawsuit Over Edward Snowden Disclosures

==Security==
{{NSA surveillance|1|2|3}}
Poitras took many security precautions related to the film, described by military writer [[Peter Maass]] among others.&lt;ref name=maass&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/magazine/laura-poitras-snowden.html|first=Peter|last=Maass|title=How Laura Poitras Helped Snowden Spill His Secrets |work=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/09/berlins-digital-exiles-tech-activists-escape-nsa |first=Carole|last=Cadwalladr|title=Berlin's digital exiles: where tech activists go to escape the NSA|date=November 9, 2014|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being detained repeatedly at border controls when entering the US.&lt;ref name=maass/&gt; She edited the film in Germany after flying directly there from Hong Kong with the Snowden footage, to prevent the FBI from showing up with a search warrant for her hard drives. All the film footage is kept on encrypted drives with multiple levels of nested protection.&lt;ref name="wired-crypto"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/10/laura-poitras-crypto-tools-made-snowden-film-possible/ |title=Laura Poitras on the Crypto Tools That Made Her Snowden Film Possible|first=Andy|last=Greenberg
|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer she uses for reading sensitive documents is separated from the internet by an [[air gap (networking)|air gap]]. Greenwald credited her with a "complete expert level of understanding of how to do a story like this with total technical and operational safety". Maass called Poitras' security skills "particularly vital — and far from the journalistic norm — in an era of pervasive government spying", and quotes Snowden stating that "[i]n the wake of this year's disclosure, it should be clear that unencrypted journalist-source communication is unforgivably reckless."&lt;ref name=maass/&gt;

Bonnefoy has also discussed the encrypted workflow used in making the film, adding "if we have a conversation that's particularly confidential, we'll move the electronics out of the room, or we'll just meet somewhere outside of the editing room, without our phones."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/88016-positive-trauma-editor-mathilde-bonnefoy-on-citizenfour/ |title=Positive Trauma: Editor Mathilde Bonnefoy on CITIZENFOUR|work=[[Filmmaker magazine]] |first=Scott|last=Macaulay|date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] (which selects films for the New York Film Festival) reported&lt;ref name=nyff2&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.filmlinc.com/daily/entry/silent-no-more-laura-poitras-talks-about-citizenfour|title=Silent No More, Laura Poitras Talks About 'CITIZENFOUR'|first=Eugene|last=Hernandez |date=October 14, 2014|publisher=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Poitras changed the location of the initial screening for the NYFF's selection committee several times, in case someone was tracking her movements. The committee was shown a rough cut that had sensitive material redacted, and the NYFF "had to keep the movie's inclusion in the festival under wraps until mid-September" and it was "kept out of festival schedules and documents until we could talk about it openly". The last-minute inclusion in the festival's main slate was an unprecedented event for the NYFF,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/edward-snowden-doc-added-new-733161|title=New York Film Fest: Top-Secret Edward Snowden Doc Added to Lineup |first=Scott|last=Feinberg|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "tickets for both screenings sold out within just a few hours".&lt;ref name=nyff2/&gt;

The film's ending credits unusually&lt;ref name="wired-crypto"/&gt; name several [[free software]] projects and security tools, without which "this film would not be possible". The programs named include [[Tor (software)|Tor]], [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]], [[Debian GNU/Linux]], [[Off-the-Record Messaging]], the [[GNU Privacy Guard]], [[Truecrypt]], and [[SecureDrop]].

The '''Clean Energy Finance Corporation''' ('''CEFC''') is an Australian Government-owned [[Green Bank (financial institution)|Green Bank]] that was established to facilitate increased flows of finance into the clean energy sector.  The CEFC is responsible for investing $10 billion in clean energy projects on behalf of the Australian Government.  Its mission is to help lower Australia's carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies across the economy, via a range of finance options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cefc.com.au/where-we-invest/|title=Where we invest - Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)|website=www.cefc.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CEFC also supports innovative start-up companies through the Clean Energy Innovation Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cefc.com.au/where-we-invest/innovation-fund/|title=Innovation Fund - Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)|website=www.cefc.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Across its portfolio, the CEFC invests to deliver a positive return for taxpayers.

The CEFC invests in accordance with its legislation, the ''Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012'' (CEFC Act) &lt;ref&gt;http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/cth/num_act/cefca2012297/&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevailing Investment Mandate. The CEFC is a corporate Commonwealth entity under the ''Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013'' (PGPA Act).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00269&lt;/ref&gt; The CEFC has access to funding of $10 billion comprising annual appropriations to the CEFC Special Account of $2 billion every 1 July from 2013 to 2017 inclusive, in accordance with section 46 of the CEFC Act. The CEFC draws on this finance on an as needs basis, with non-committed funds remaining in the Special Account until required.

The CEFC is governed by an independent Board which has a statutory responsibility for decision-making, performance of the Corporation's functions and managing the CEFC's investments, and a Chief Executive Officer who is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Corporation. A system of delegations exist to aid in the performance of these functions. The Board reports to Parliament through its Responsible Ministers.

The CEFC's investment objectives are to catalyse and leverage an increased flow of funds for the commercialisation and deployment of Australian-based renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies. The CEFC achieves its objectives through the prudent application of capital, in adherence with its risk management framework, its Investment Mandate and the investment policies issued by the CEFC Board.

In March 2017, Mr Ian Learmonth was appointed CEO,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cefc.com.au/media/files/cefc-board-appoints-ian-learmonth-as-new-chief-executive-officer-replacing-oliver-yates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; replacing founding CEO Mr Oliver Yates. New Board members&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cefc.com.au/media/296276/minister-cormann-minister-frydenberg-media-release-cefc-appointments.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; were appointed from August 2017, with Mr Steven Skala AO replacing founding chair Ms Jillian Broadbent AO.

==History==
The CEFC was established under the ''Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012'', passed by the [[Parliament of Australia]] on 22 July 2012.&lt;ref name="cefcb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r4814 |title=Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012 |date=16 August 2012 |work=Parliament of Australia |publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]] |accessdate=19 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established on 3 August 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/reports/annual-reports/files/annual-report-2013-14/governance-and-corporate-information/the-cefc-and-government.aspx |title=The CEFC and Government - Enabling legislation |publisher=Cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced making investment commitments from 1 July 2013.

On 5 August 2013 the federal Coalition Opposition led by [[Tony Abbott]] wrote to the CEFC asking it to stop making new loans and to cease assessing new projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=Tony|title=Coalition Leader's Letter to CEFC 5 Aug 2013|url=http://static.liberal.org.au.s3.amazonaws.com/13-08-05%20Signed%20Carbon%20Tax%20Letters%20-%20TA.pdf|publisher=Leader of the Opposition|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], on 5 December 2013, then CEFC Chair Jillian Broadbent said on ABC Radio National that the government should "break an election promise" and keep the CEFC in operation, citing a 7% profit. Coalition Senator Arthur Sinodinos said that if it's making a profit, it should survive without the government and essentially confirmed the government would shut the corporation down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourne|first=James|title=CEFC fights for its life.|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/cefc-makes-a-pitch-for-its-continued-existence/5135882|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Legislation to abolish the CEFC and transfer the CEFC's existing assets and liabilities to the Commonwealth was put before Parliament but blocked by non-government senators in the Senate. In July 2015, Abbott announced he would ban the CEFC from investing in wind power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-has-escalated-his-war-on-wind-power-20150711-gia3xi.html|title=Tony Abbott has escalated his war on wind power|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 Jul 2015|author=Adam Gartell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rooftop solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-pulls-the-plug-on-household-solar-20150712-gian0u.html|title=Government pulls the plug on household solar|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=13 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July 2015, the CEFC said it was taking advice in relation to the draft Mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/media/releases-and-announcements/files/statement-from-the-cefc.aspx |title=Statement from the CEFC |publisher=Cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au |date=2015-07-13 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Fairfax media reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had lifted the ban on CEFC investment in wind power, in his first major break from the former regime's environmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Federal Politics |url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-has-lifted-tony-abbotts-wind-power-investment-ban-20151211-glly40 |title=Malcolm Turnbull has lifted Tony Abbott's wind power investment ban |publisher=[[Theage.com.au]] |date=2015-12-13 |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' reported on 24 December 2015 that the CEFC had been directed to focus on innovative and emerging technologies, reversing a mandate by the former prime minister Tony Abbott that would have specifically blocked funding for windfarms and small-scale solar projects.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 24 December 2015: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/24/new-clean-energy-investment-mandate-a-shift-from-policy-proposed-by-abbott New clean energy investment mandate a shift from policy proposed by Abbott]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Australian Government further tasked the CEFC with creating a $1 billion Sustainable Cities Investment Program and a $1 billion Reef Funding Program, in addition to its $200 million Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which is operated alongside the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). Finance for the three programs is drawn from the CEFC's existing $10 billion allocation, with investments to be made in accordance with usual CEFC investment practice.

Then CEFC Chair Jillian Broadbent AO canvassed the CEFC's role in the energy sector in a March 2017 [http://www.cefc.com.au/media/files/australias-energy-future-achieving-the-goals-of-energy-security,-sustainability-and-affordability.aspx discussion] on "Australia's Energy Future: Achieving the goals of energy security, sustainability and affordability." In her comments, Broadbent said: "Australia's energy mix can incorporate higher levels of clean energy with strengthened transmission, better demand management systems and increased storage capacity. These need to be planned and co-ordinated."

These matters were explored further in the CEFC's [http://www.cefc.com.au/media/246032/cefc-submission-to-the-independent-review-into-the-future-security-of-the-national-electricity-market-february-2017.pdf submission] to the Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market - commonly referred to as the Finkel Review. The CEFC said the March 2017 submission drew on its experience as a specialist clean energy investor to frame out a number of areas that would benefit from reform, including: Market design to support security and reliability; technology to transform the electricity sector and barriers to investment.

==Commercial approach==
The CEFC applies a commercial approach when making investment decisions and seeks to develop a portfolio across the spectrum of clean energy technologies that in aggregate must have an acceptable but not excessive level of risk relative to the sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://annualreport2015.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/performance/year-in-review/our-investment-portfolio/aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The Corporation applies a commercial filter when making its investment decisions, focussing on projects and technologies at the later stages of development. The filter is not as stringent as the private sector equivalent, as the Corporation has a public policy purpose and values any positive externalities being generated. Consequently, it has different risk/return requirements. For a given return, the Corporation may take on higher risk and, for a given level of risk, due to positive externalities, may accept a lower financial return. In line with its policy intent, the Corporation considers the positive externalities and public policy outcomes when making investment decisions and when determining the extent of any concession for an investment.&lt;ref name="ausrenewpolicy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrnes |first=L. |last2=Brown |first2=C. |last3=Foster |first3=J. |last4=Wagner |first4=L. |date=December 2013 |title=Australian renewable energy policy: Barriers and challenges |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=60 |pages=711–721 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148113003170 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CEFC submission to the Statutory Review of the Corporation is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cefc.com.au/media/390711/statutory-review-cefc-submission-february-2018.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investment commitments==

In July 2018, CEO Ian Learmonth [https://www.cefc.com.au/media/files/cefc-broadens-emissions-focus-in-another-year-of-record-investment/ reported] that the CEFC had directly committed to a further 39 projects in the 12 months to 30 June 2018, up from 36 direct investments in FY17. Total new CEFC commitments in FY18 were $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in the previous year. CEFC commitments in FY18 included $1.1 billion in renewable energy, $939 million in energy efficiency, $100 million in transport and $127 million in waste-related projects. At 30 June 2018, total CEFC investment commitments since inception exceeded $6.6 billion. After allowing for repayment, amortisation and any cancellations, the CEFC investment portfolio was $5.3 billion at 30 June 2018. In five years of investing, CEFC commitments have now contributed to clean energy projects Australia-wide, with a total project value of $19 billion. The organisation had directly invested in more than 110 individual transactions and delivered finance for more than 5,500 smaller-scale clean energy projects. The CEFC said each dollar of CEFC investment commitments was matched by more than $1.80 of private sector finance, with the portfolio of investment commitments targeting annual cuts to greenhouse gas emissions of 10.8 million tonnes of CO2-e, and lifetime cuts to greenhouse gas emissions of more than 190 million tonnes of CO2-e.

Throughout 2017-18, the CEFC announced a number of innovative financing transactions to encourage additional private sector investment in measures to reduce carbon emissions. These included measures to lower agribusiness-related emissions, through the agricultural platform of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cefc.com.au/media/files/cefc-in-finance-first-to-target-energy-efficiency-and-sustainability-in-australian-farming-sector/|title=CEFC in finance first to target energy efficiency and sustainability in Australian farming sector - Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)|website=www.cefc.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as lowering infrastructure-related carbon emissions, with an investment in the IFM Australian Infrastructure Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cefc.com.au/media/files/ifm-investors-and-the-cefc-work-together-to-cut-carbon-emissions-in-the-infrastructure-assets/|title=IFM Investors and the CEFC work together to cut carbon emissions in the infrastructure assets - Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)|website=www.cefc.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEFC has also identified transport-related emissions as an ongoing investment priority and, with ARENA, commissioned a detailed report into measures to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cefc.com.au/where-we-invest/transport/|title=Transport - Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)|website=www.cefc.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clean Energy Innovation Fund ==
At 30 June 2018, the CEFC reported that the Clean Energy Innovation Fund had established itself as the largest dedicated Australian investor of its kind. The Innovation Fund was created as a specialist financier to invest $200 million in early-stage clean energy companies.  It draws on CEFC finance to provide primarily equity finance to innovative clean energy projects and businesses which involve renewable, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies.  The Innovation Fund made investments commitments of more than $55 million in nine transactions in its first 18 months. The investments were across a diverse range of technologies – from second life batteries to smart meters; from state-of-the art car wheels to the internet of things, and many more.  The CEFC said the investments demonstrate the potential of Australian innovators to lead Australia's transition to a low carbon economy, helping to lower carbon emissions and to deliver on the benefits of clean energy. They also demonstrated the potential for innovative companies to capitalise on the new business opportunities emerging from Australia's clean energy transition. The CEFC draws on the technical expertise of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) in assessing potential investment opportunities for the Innovation Fund. The Innovation Fund does not provide grants.

== Object and functions ==
The object of the CEFC is specified in section 3 of the CEFC Act as being 'to facilitate financial flows into the clean energy sector'. The main function of the CEFC is the 'investment function' (as specified in section 9 and subsection 58(1) of the CEFC Act), to invest, directly and indirectly, in renewable and low carbon technologies. Section 9 also specifies a number of support functions such as:

* liaison with relevant individuals, businesses and agencies to facilitate the investment function
* to perform any other functions conferred by the CEFC Act or any other Commonwealth law
* to do anything incidental or conducive to the performance of the investment function or the other functions.

==Responsible ministers==
Under section 4 of the CEFC Act, the Responsible Ministers are the Minister for the Environment and Energy and the Minister for Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annualreport2015.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/governance-structure-people/governance-structure-people-overview/responsible-ministers/ |title=Responsible Ministers |publisher=Annualreport2015.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nominated Minister is one of the Responsible Ministers who exercises additional powers and functions under the CEFC Act. Subsection 76(1) of the CEFC Act provides that the Responsible Ministers determine between them which is to be nominated.

==CEFC operations==
The CEFC is a statutory authority established by the Australian Government under the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012.  Under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act (PGPA Act), the CEFC is known as a corporate Commonwealth entity.  The CEFC Act:

* Creates the CEFC Special Account, a Special Account under the PGPA Act which is credited with $2 billion each 1 July, for five years from 1 July 2013, to enable the CEFC to invest in the clean energy sector
* Provides the CEFC Board with statutory responsibility for decision-making and managing the CEFC's investments. The Board operates and makes its investment decisions independently of government, based on rigorous commercial assessments
* Provides for the appointment of the CEFC Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the CEFC, subject to (and in accordance with the policies determined by) the Board
* Requires investments by the CEFC to be "complying investments" as defined in Section 59 (2).

The CEFC publishes quarterly reports on its website regarding investment commitments.

==Investment Mandate==

An Investment Mandate direction [https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L00035] is the means by which the Government of the day provides instruction as to how the Corporation can make investments, providing it:
* does not have a purpose of directing the Corporation to require the corporation to make or not make a particular investment and
* is not inconsistent with the Act, (including the object of the Act).

Under the CEFC Act, the CEFC Board must be consulted on the draft of a proposed new mandate, and any submission made by the Board must be tabled in the Parliament. [https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012A00104/Html/Text#_Toc330982504]

==Offices==

CEFC is headquartered in Sydney with offices also in Brisbane and Melbourne, and an additional staff member based in Townsville to focus on opportunities in North Queensland and in the Reef Catchment Area.&lt;ref name="10cf"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.financialstandard.com.au/news/view/27445296 |title=$10bn CEFC fund gets govt mandate |author=Alice Uribe |accessdate=18 May 2013 |date=26 April 2013 |work=Financial Standard |publisher=Rainmaker Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservation-reliant species''' are animal or plant [[species]] that require continuing species-specific [[wildlife management]] intervention such as [[Hunting#Wildlife management|predator control]], [[Habitat conservation|habitat management]] and [[Pest control|parasite control]] to survive, even when a self-sustainable recovery in population is achieved.&lt;ref name="NCSE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncseonline.org/Conference/Biodiversity/cms.cfm?id=2396 |title=Endangered Species and Other Conservation Reliant Species |last=J.

== History ==

The term "conservation-reliant species" grew out of the [[conservation biology]] undertaken by ''The Endangered Species Act at Thirty Project'' (launched 2001)&lt;ref name="Goble"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goble |first=Dale |author2=J. Michael Scott |author3=Frank W. Davis |title=The Endangered Species Act at Thirty: Renewing the Conservation Promise |publisher=Island Press |year=2006 |volume=I |pages=xii, 299 |isbn=978-1-59726-009-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vEh7m1k5WMwC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=%22conservation+reliant+species%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularization by project leader [[J. Michael Scott]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=J. Michael |date=Jan 2007 |title=AOU Conservation Award, 2006 |journal=The Auk |publisher=The American Ornithologists' Union |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=353–355 |issn=0004-8038 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1642/0004-8038%282007%29124%5B353%3AACA%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2007)124[353:ACA]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first use in a formal publication was in ''Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment'' in 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Worldwide use of the term has not yet developed and it has not yet appeared in a publication compiled outside North America.&lt;!--?: &lt;ref&gt;Note: See publication information of article references.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Passages of the 1973 [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) carried with it the assumption that endangered species would be delisted as their populations recovered. It assumed they would then thrive under existing regulations and the protections afforded under the ESA would no longer be needed. However, eighty percent of [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|species currently listed]] under the ESA fail to meet that assumption. To survive, they require species-specific conservation interventions (e.g. control of predators, competitors, nest parasites, prescribed burns, altered hydrological processes, etc.) and thus they are conservation-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.fws.gov/EC/WebSeminarSeries/aug08/information_page.html Conservation Reliant Species: Our New Relationship with Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==

The criteria for assessing whether a species is conservation-reliant are:&lt;ref name="Scott1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://training.fws.gov/EC/WebSeminarSeries/aug08/conservation_reliant_species.pdf |title=Conservation Reliant Species:Our New Relationship with Nature? |last=Scott |first=J. Michael Scott |author2=Dale Goble |author3=Aaron Haines |date=August 21, 2008 |work=CSP3900 Conservation Science Web Conference Series |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Threats to the species’ continued existence are known and treatable.
# The threats are pervasive and recurrent, for example: nest parasites, non-native [[predator]]s, human disturbance.
# The threats render the species at risk of [[extinction]], absent ongoing conservation management.
# Management actions sufficient to counter threats have been identified and can be implemented, for example: [[controlled burn|prescribed fires]], restrictions on grazing or public access, predator or parasite control.
# National, state or local governments, often in cooperation with private or tribal interests, are capable of carrying out the necessary management actions as long as necessary.

== Management actions ==

There are five major areas of management action for conservation of vulnerable species:
# Control of other species may include: control of [[Introduced species#Introduced animals|exotic fauna]], [[Introduced species#Introduced plants|exotic flora]], other native species and [[parasite]]s and [[disease]].
# Control of direct human impacts may include control of [[Grazing#Disadvantages|grazing]], human access, on and [[off-road vehicle]]s, low impact [[recreation]] and illegal collecting and [[poaching]].
# Pollution control may include control of chemical [[Surface runoff|run-off]], [[siltation]], [[water quality]] and use of [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s.
# Active [[Habitat conservation|habitat management]] may include [[Wildfire suppression|fire management and control]], control of [[Erosion|soil erosion]] and [[waterbody|waterbodies]], habitat [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] and [[Weed control#Organic methods|mechanical vegetation control]].
# Artificial population recruitment may include captive propagation (forced immigration) or [[captive breeding]].&lt;ref name="Scott1"/&gt;

== Case study ==
[[File:Indian Tiger.jpg|thumb|225px|Bengal tiger at [[Bannerghatta National Park]], Bangalore, India.]]

A prominent example is in [[India]], where [[Bengal tiger|tigers]], an [[apex predator]] and the national animal, are considered a conservation-reliant species. This [[keystone species]] can maintain self-sustaining wild populations; however, they require ongoing management actions because threats are pervasive, recurrent and put them at risk of extinction. The origin of these threats are rooted in the changing socio-economic, political and spatial organization of society in India. Tigers have become extinct in some areas because of extrinsic factors such as habitat destruction, poaching, disease, floods, fires and drought, decline of prey species for the same reasons, as well as intrinsic factors such as demographic [[stochastic]]ity and [[genetic deterioration]].

Recognizing the conservation reliance of tigers, [[Project Tiger]] is establishing a national science-based framework for monitoring tiger population trends in order to manage the species more effectively. India now has 28 tiger reserves, located in 17 states. These reserves cover {{convert|37761|km2|sqmi}} including 1.14% of the total land area of the country. These reserves are kept free of biotic disturbances, forestry operations, collection of minor forest products, grazing and human disturbance. The populations of tigers in these reserves now constitute some of the most important tiger source populations in the country.&lt;ref name="Maraj"&gt;{{cite web |last=R Maraj, J Seidensticker |title=Assessment of a Framework for Monitoring Tiger Population Trends in India |url=http://projecttiger.nic.in/whtsnew/Assessment%20of%20a%20framework%20for%20monitoring%20tiger%20population%20trends%20in%20India-%202006.pdf |year=2006 |work=A Report to the IUCN: World Conservation Union and India's Project Tiger |publisher=Govt. of India, Project Tiger |pages=7–9 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==

The magnitude and pace of human impacts on the environment make it unlikely that substantial progress will be made in delisting many species unless the definition of "recovery" includes some form of active management. Preventing delisted species from again being at risk of extinction may require continuing, species-specific management actions. Viewing "recovery" of  "conservation-reliant species" as a continuum of phases rather a simple "recovered/not recovered" status may enhance the ability to manage such species within the framework of the Endangered Species Act. With ongoing loss of habitat, disruption of natural cycles, increasing impacts of non-native invasive species, it is probable that the number of conservation-reliant species will increase.

It has been proposed that development of "recovery management agreements", with legally and biologically defensible contracts would provide for continuing conservation management following delisting. The use of such formalized agreements will facilitate shared management responsibilities between federal wildlife agencies and other federal agencies, and with state, local, and tribal governments, as well as with private entities that have demonstrated the capability to meet the needs of conservation-reliant species.&lt;ref name="Scott2"&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 2005 |title=Recovery of imperiled species under the Endangered Species Act: The need for a new approach |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |publisher=ProQuest-CSA |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=383–89 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7326616&amp;q=%22conservation+reliant+species%22&amp;uid=1014961&amp;setcookie=yes |doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0383:ROISUT]2.0.CO;2 |last1=Scott |first1=J Michael |last2=Goble |first2=Dale D. |last3=Wiens |first3=John A. |last4=Wilcove |first4=David S. |last5=Bean |first5=Michael |last6=Male |first6=Timothy |issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Contrail with crow instability.jpg|The Crow instability is also responsible for this different shape of contrail|thumb|200px]]

In [[aerodynamics]], the '''Crow Instability''', or '''V.C.I. vortex crow instability''', is an [[Inviscid flow|inviscid]] line-vortex instability, named after its discoverer S. C. Crow.
The Crow instability is most commonly observed in the skies behind large aircraft such as the Boeing 747. It occurs when the [[wingtip vortices]] interact with [[contrail]]s from the engines, producing visible distortions in the shape of the contrail.

== Instability development ==
The Crow Instability is a vortex pair instability, and typically goes through several stages:
*A pair of counter rotating vortices act upon each other to amplify small [[sinusoidal]] distortions in their vortex shapes (normally created by some initial disturbance in the system).
*The waves develop into either symmetric or anti-symmetric modes, depending on the nature of the initial disturbance.
*These distortions grow, both through interaction from one vortex on another, and also 'Self Induction' of a vortex with itself. This leads to an exponential growth in the vortex wave amplitude.
*The vortex amplitudes reach a critical value and reconnect, forming a chain of [[vortex ring]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">The '''Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone''' ('''DCVZ''') is an orographically-induced atmospheric phenomenon characterized by convergent winds east of the [[Denver]] metropolitan area, typically 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;km in length and oriented in a north-south direction. This meteorological feature was subject to academic scrutiny following a large outbreak of Denver-area [[tornado]]es in 1981 and has been used to explain the propensity of the area to spawn [[landspout]] ([[misocyclone]]) and [[supercell]] ([[mesocyclone]]) tornadoes.&lt;ref name="25 yrs"&gt;{{cite conference |first = Edward J. |last = Szoke |title = The Denver Cyclone and Tornadoes 25 Years later: The Continued Challenge of Predicting Non-supercell Tornadoes |booktitle = 23rd Conf Severe Local Storms |pages = |publisher = American Meteorological Society |date = 8 Nov 2006

Email correspondence quoted by Sam Barricklow, http://www.k5kj.net/DCVZ.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
DCVZ conditions form when a low-level moist, southeasterly flowing [[air mass]] meets the [[Palmer Divide]], a ridge that extends east of the [[Colorado Front Range]]. If the moist air lifts over the ridge and meets northwesterly winds originating in the [[Rocky Mountain]] foothills, winds may converge to create enhanced cyclonic [[vorticity]].&lt;ref name="Haby"/&gt; A study conducted between 1981 and 1989 demonstrated that the DCVZ formed on one-third of all days during the [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] season (May through August).&lt;ref&gt;Szoke, E.J., and J.A. Augustine, 1990: An examination of the mean flow and thermodynamic characteristics of a mesoscale flow feature: The Denver Cyclone.

DCVZ conditions are often associated with the [[Denver Cyclone]] effect, which is characterized by the formation of a large [[gyre]] near the city center.&lt;ref name="k5kj.net"/&gt;

== Role in Denver area tornado formation ==
Several studies have documented the role of the DCVZ in [[tornado outbreak]]s across the Denver area. Using climatic data from the 1980s, one researcher has suggested that the presence of a strong June DCVZ has been associated with a 70% chance of zone-area tornado [[Tornadogenesis|formation]].&lt;ref&gt;Szoke, E.J., and J.A.

'''Malaysian blackwood''' ('''''Diospyros ebonasea'''''), is a species of [[Flowering plant|flowering]] [[tree]] in the family [[Ebenaceae]] that is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the forests of [[Malaysia]]. Malaysian blackwood is a nickname of this wood, but actually this wood is one of the [[ebony]] family in the world.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Malaysian Blackwood Guitar.jpg|128px|thumbnail|left|A guitar body made from Malaysian blackwood]]
Malaysian blackwood is a premium tonewood that is well suited for all sorts of guitars. It has become a favorite of several well-known high-end luthiers, and its popularity is growing. Denser than most [[rosewood]], the sustaining, glassy tap tone draws comparisons to [[African blackwood]]. It is slightly less brittle though, and unlike African blackwood, most sets have dark streaks. The overall coloring is similar to ziricote, with black and dark gray colors highlighted by subtle reddish brown and/or green hues.

A '''directed-energy weapon''' ('''DEW''') is a [[ranged weapon]] that damages its target with highly focused [[energy]], including [[laser]], [[microwave]]s and [[particle beam]]s. Potential applications of this technology include weapons that target [[anti-personnel weapon|personnel]], [[missile defense|missiles]], vehicles, and optical devices.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/10303988/Golden-Eye-style-energy-beam-is-developed-by-Nato-scientists.html "Daily Telegraph, 12th September 2013"], ''Golden Eye-style energy beam is developed by Nato scientists'', Oct. 08, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milsat2&gt;[http://www.satnews.com/story.php?number=1272864526 "Milsat Magazine, Satnews Daily, June 24th 2009"], ''U.S. Navy Laser Versus UAVs...

Directed energy weapons could have several main advantages over conventional weaponry:
* Direct energy weapons can be used discreetly; radiation above and below the visible spectrum is invisible and does not generate sound.&lt;ref name="Defence IQ Press"&gt;[http://www.defenceiq.com/army-and-land-forces/articles/we-talk-to-dr-pali-ek-about-directed-energy-system/ "Defence IQ talks to Dr Palíšek about Directed Energy Weapon systems"], ''Defence iQ', Nov. 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmb.physics.wisc.edu/tutorial/spectrum.html Spectrum Tutorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531032118/http://cmb.physics.wisc.edu/tutorial/spectrum.html |date=2013-05-31 }}, University of Wisconsin Electromagnetic Spectrum Tutorial, accessed 22/06/2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Light is only [[Gravitational lens|very slightly altered by gravity]], giving it an almost perfectly [[Bullet drop|flat trajectory]]. It is also practically immune (in anything resembling normal planetary conditions) to both [[windage]] and [[Coriolis force]]. This makes aim much more precise and extends the range to line-of-sight, limited only by beam diffraction and spread (which dilute the power and weaken the effect), and absorption or scattering by intervening atmospheric contents.
* Lasers could possibly have much greater speed and range than conventional weapons, therefore, are suitable for use in [[space warfare]].

== Microwave weapons ==

Although some devices are labelled as microwave weapons, the microwave range is commonly defined as being between 300&amp;nbsp;MHz and 300&amp;nbsp;GHz which is within the [[RF]] range&lt;ref&gt;[http://wifiinschools.org.uk/15.html RF vs Microwave Freq range], Microwaves and radio waves&lt;/ref&gt;—these frequencies having wavelengths of 1–1000 micrometers. Some examples of weapons which have been publicized by the military are as follows:
* [[Active Denial System]] is a millimeter wave source that heats the water in a human target's skin and thus causes incapacitating pain. It was developed by the [[Air Force Research Laboratory|U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory]] and [[Raytheon]] for riot-control duty. Though intended to cause severe pain while leaving no lasting damage, concern has been voiced as to whether the system could cause irreversible damage to the eyes. There has yet to be testing for long-term side effects of exposure to the microwave beam. It can also destroy [[Electromagnetic shielding|unshielded electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[CBS News]] | date = 2008-06-01 | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | title = The Pentagon's Ray Gun | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/02/29/60minutes/main3891865.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device comes in various sizes including attached to a [[humvee]].
* [[Vigilant Eagle]] is a proposed airport defense system that directs high-frequency microwaves towards any projectile that is fired at an aircraft.&lt;ref name=AZrep&gt;
''Raytheon focuses on non-lethal weapons, Andrew Johnson, (The Arizona Republic, 09-17-2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of a missile-detecting and tracking subsystem (MDT), a command and control system, and a scanning array. The MDT is a fixed grid of passive infrared (IR) cameras. The command and control system determines the missile launch point. The scanning array projects microwaves that disrupt the surface-to-air missile's guidance system, deflecting it from the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/rtnwcm/groups/rms/documents/content/rtn_rms_ps_vigilanteagle_datas.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bofors HPM Blackout]] is a high-powered microwave weapon that is said to be able to destroy at short distance a wide variety of [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) electronic equipment. It is said to be not lethal to humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/BAE_GCSW_hpm_blackout.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825185029/http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/BAE_GCSW_hpm_blackout.html |date=August 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Karlsson (2009).

== Laser weapons ==

=== Electrolaser ===

{{Main article|Electrolaser}}
An electrolaser first [[blooming (directed-energy weapon)|ionizes]] its target path, and then sends a powerful electric current down the conducting track of [[ionization|ionized]] plasma, somewhat like [[lightning]]. It functions as a giant, high-energy, long-distance version of the [[Taser]] or [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]].

=== Pulsed energy projectile ===
{{Main article|Pulsed energy projectile}}

Pulsed Energy Projectile or PEP systems emit an infrared laser pulse which creates rapidly expanding [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] at the target. The resulting sound, shock and electromagnetic waves stun the target and cause pain and temporary paralysis. The weapon is under development and is intended as a non-lethal weapon in crowd control though it can also be used as a lethal weapon.

=== Dazzler ===

A [[Dazzler (weapon)|dazzler]] is a directed-energy weapon intended to temporarily blind or disorient its target with intense directed radiation. Targets can include sensors or human vision. Dazzlers emit [[infrared]] or invisible light against various electronic sensors, and [[visible light]] against humans, when they are intended to cause no long-term damage to [[eye]]s. The emitters are usually [[laser]]s, making what is termed a ''laser dazzler''. Most of the contemporary systems are man-portable, and operate in either the red (a [[laser diode]]) or green (a [[diode-pumped solid-state laser]], DPSS) areas of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Initially developed for military use, non-military products are becoming available for use in law enforcement and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/us-cops-and-military-to-get-laser-guns-602983 |title=US cops and military to get laser guns |date=27 May 2009 |author=Mark Harris |publisher=[[Techradar.com]] |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20011548-71.html |title=Police to experiment with blinding 'Dazer Laser'? |author=Chris Matyszczyk |date=23 July 2010 |publisher=[[CNET]].com |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems with laser weapons===

==== Blooming ====
{{See also|Thermal blooming}}
Laser beams begin to cause [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] breakdown in the atmosphere at energy densities of around one [[Joule|megajoule]] per cubic centimetre. This effect, called "blooming," causes the laser to defocus and disperse energy into the surrounding air.  Blooming can be more severe if there is [[fog]], [[smoke]], or [[dust]] in the air.

Techniques that may reduce these effects include:
* Spreading the beam across a large, curved mirror that focuses the power on the target, to keep energy density en route too low for blooming to happen. This requires a large, very precise, fragile mirror, mounted somewhat like a searchlight, requiring bulky machinery to slew the mirror to aim the laser.
* Using a [[phased array]]. For typical laser [[wavelength]]s, this method would require billions of [[micrometre]]-size [[antenna (radio)|antennae]].  There is currently no known way to implement these, though [[carbon nanotube]]s have been proposed. Phased arrays could theoretically also perform [[Nonlinear optics|phase-conjugate amplification]] (see below). Phased arrays do not require mirrors or lenses, and can be made flat and thus do not require a turret-like system (as in "spread beam") to be aimed, though range will suffer if the target is at extreme angles to the surface of the phased array.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3x.html#laser Atomic Rocket: Space War: Weapons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using a phase-conjugate laser system. This method employs a "finder" or "guide" laser illuminating the target. Any mirror-like ("specular") points on the target reflect light that is sensed by the weapon's primary amplifier. The weapon then amplifies inverted waves, in a positive feedback loop, destroying the target, with [[shock wave|shockwaves]] as the specular regions evaporate. This avoids blooming because the waves from the target pass through the blooming, and therefore show the most conductive optical path; this automatically corrects for the distortions caused by blooming. Experimental systems using this method usually use special chemicals to form a "[[phase-conjugate mirror]]". In most systems, the mirror overheats dramatically at weapon-useful power levels.
* Using a very short pulse that finishes before blooming interferes.
* Focusing multiple lasers of relatively low power on a single target.

====Countermeasures====
The Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] has invested in the development of coatings that can deflect beams fired by U.S. military lasers.  Laser light can be deflected, reflected, or absorbed by manipulating physical and chemical properties of materials. Artificial coatings can counter certain specific types of lasers, but a different type of laser may match the coating's [[absorption spectrum]] enough to transfer damaging amounts of energy. The coatings are made of several different substances, including low-cost metals, [[rare earths]], [[carbon fiber]], silver, and diamonds that have been processed to fine sheens and tailored against specific laser weapons. China is developing anti-laser defenses because protection against them is considered far cheaper than creating competing laser weapons themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1444732/us-lasers-pla-preparing-raise-its-deflector-shields US lasers?

== Particle-beam weapons ==
{{Main article|Particle-beam weapon}}
Particle-beam weapons can use charged or neutral particles, and can be either endoatmospheric or exoatmospheric. [[Particle beam]]s as beam weapons are theoretically possible, but practical weapons have not been demonstrated yet. Certain types of particle beams have the advantage of being self-focusing in the atmosphere.

[[Blooming (directed-energy weapon)|Blooming]] is also a problem in particle-beam weapons. Energy that would otherwise be focused on the target spreads out; the beam becomes less effective:
* Thermal blooming occurs in both charged and neutral particle beams, and occurs when particles bump into one another under the effects of thermal vibration, or bump into air molecules.
* Electrical blooming occurs only in charged particle beams, as ions of like charge repel one another.

=== Plasma weapons ===
{{Main article|Plasma weapon}}

Plasma weapons fire a beam, bolt, or [[particle beam|stream]] of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is an excited [[state of matter]] consisting of atomic electrons &amp; nuclei and free electrons if [[ionization|ionized]], or other particles if [[pinch (plasma physics)|pinched]].

The [[MARAUDER]] (''Magnetically Accelerated Ring to Achieve Ultra-high Directed-Energy and Radiation'') used the [[Shiva Star]] project (a high energy capacitor bank which provided the means to test weapons and other devices requiring brief and extremely large amounts of energy) to accelerate a toroid of plasma at a significant percentage of the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=7369133 |title=Energy Citations Database (ECD) – – Document #7369133 |doi=10.1063/1.860681 |publisher=Osti.gov |accessdate=2012-06-12|bibcode=1993PhFlB...5.2938D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Sonic weaponry}}

Cavitation, which affects gas nuclei in human tissue, and heating can result from exposure to ultrasound and can damage tissue and organs. Studies have found{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} that exposure to high intensity ultrasound at frequencies from 700&amp;nbsp;kHz to 3.6&amp;nbsp;MHz can cause lung and intestinal damage in mice.  Heart rate patterns following vibroacoustic stimulation have resulted in potentially serious atrial flutter and [[bradycardia]]. Researchers have concluded that generating pain through the auditory system using high intensity sound risked permanent hearing damage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Extra-aural (unrelated to hearing) bioeffects on various internal organs and the central nervous system included auditory shifts, [[vibrotactile]] sensitivity change, muscle contraction, [[cardiovascular]] function change, [[central nervous system]] effects, [[vestibular]] ([[inner ear]]) effects, and [[chest wall]]/lung tissue effects.  Researchers found that low frequency sonar exposure could result in significant [[cavitation]]s, [[hypothermia]], and tissue shearing. Follow-on experiments were not recommended.

Tests performed on mice show the threshold for both lung and liver damage occurs at about 184 [[Decibel|dB]].  Damage increases rapidly as intensity is increased.  Noise-induced [[neurological]] disturbances in humans exposed to continuous low frequency tones for durations longer than 15 minutes involved development of immediate and long-term problems affecting brain tissue. The symptoms resembled those of individuals who had suffered minor head injuries. One theory for a causal mechanism is that the prolonged sound exposure resulted in enough mechanical strain to brain tissue to induce an [[encephalopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) ===

[[File:soundweapon1.jpg|thumb|right|The LRAD is the round black device on top of the [[New York City]] police Hummer.]]
The '''[[Long Range Acoustic Device]]''' ('''LRAD''') is an [[acoustic hailing device]] developed by [[LRAD Corporation]] to send messages and warning tones over longer distances or at higher volume than normal [[loudspeaker]]s. LRAD systems are used for long range communications in a variety of applications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lradx.com/application/ Applications – LRAD Corporation website]&lt;/ref&gt; including as a means of non-lethal, non-kinetic crowd control.

=== Mirrors of Archimedes ===
[[File:Archimedes Heat Ray conceptual diagram.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a [[parabolic reflector]] to burn ships attacking [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].]]
{{main article|Archimedes#Heat ray}}
According to a legend, [[Archimedes]] created a mirror with an adjustable focal length (or more likely, a series of mirrors focused on a common point) to focus sunlight on ships of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fleet as they invaded [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], setting them on fire.&lt;ref name=noScifi&gt;Bill Sweetman.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20150810084543/http://aviationweek.com/defense/directed-energy-weapons-no-longer-science-fiction Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Historians point out that the earliest accounts of the battle did not mention a "burning mirror", but merely stated that Archimedes's ingenuity combined with a way to hurl fire were relevant to the victory. Some attempts to replicate this feat have had some success; in particular, an experiment by students at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] showed that a mirror-based weapon was at least possible, if not necessarily practical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/lectures/10_ArchimedesResult.html Archimedes Death Ray: Idea Feasibility Testing]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Watson-Watt ===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}
In 1935, the British [[Air Ministry]] asked [[Robert Watson-Watt]] of the [[Radio Research Station]] whether a "[[death ray]]" was possible. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He and colleague [[Arnold Wilkins]] quickly concluded that it was not feasible, but as a consequence suggested using radio for the detection of aircraft and this started the development of [[radar]] in Britain.

=== The fictional "engine-stopping ray" ===
Stories in the 1930s and World War Two gave rise to the idea of an "engine-stopping ray". They seemed to have arisen from the testing of the television transmitter in [[Feldberg, Baden-Württemberg|Feldberg]], Germany. Because electrical noise from car engines would interfere with field strength measurements, sentries would stop all traffic in the vicinity for the twenty minutes or so needed for a test. Reversing the order of events in retelling the story created a "tale" where tourists car engine stopped first and then were approached by a German soldier who told them that they had to wait. The soldier returned a short time later to say that the engine would now work and the tourists drove off. Such stories were circulating in Britain around 1938 and during the war British Intelligence relaunched the myth as a "British engine-stopping ray", trying to spoof the Germans into researching what the British had supposedly invented in an attempt to tie up German scientific resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=R.V. |authorlink=Reginald Victor Jones |title=Most Secret War: British Scientific Intelligence 1939–1945 |date=1978 |publisher=Coronet |isbn=0-340-24169-1 |pages=84,124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German World War II experimental weapons ===

During the early 1940s [[Axis Powers|Axis]] engineers developed a [[sonic cannon]] that could cause fatal vibrations in its target body. A [[methane gas]] [[combustion chamber]] leading to two [[parabolic dish]]es pulse-detonated at roughly 44 [[Hertz|Hz]]. This sound, magnified by the dish reflectors, caused [[vertigo]] and [[nausea]] at {{convert|200|-|400|m|yd}} by vibrating the [[middle ear]] bones and shaking the [[Cochlea|cochlear fluid]] within the [[inner ear]]. At distances of {{convert|50|-|200|m|ft}}, the [[sound wave]]s could act on organ tissues and fluids by repeatedly compressing and releasing compressive resistant organs such as the [[kidney]]s, [[spleen]], and [[liver]]. (It had little detectable effect on malleable organs such as the [[heart]], [[stomach]] and [[intestine]]s.) [[Lung]] tissue was affected at only the closest ranges as [[Atmosphere|atmospheric air]] is highly compressible and only the blood rich [[alveoli]] resist compression. In practice, the [[weapon system|weapon]] was highly vulnerable to enemy fire. [[Rifle]], [[bazooka]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds easily deformed the parabolic reflectors, rendering the wave amplification ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Weird Weapons: The Axis |series=Modern Marvels |serieslink=Modern Marvels |network=The History Channel |credits=Martin O'Collins, director |date=21 February 2006 |season=12 |number=8 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later phases of [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] increasingly put its hopes on research into technologically revolutionary secret weapons, the ''[[Wunderwaffe]]n''.

Among the directed-energy weapons the Nazis investigated were [[X-ray]] beam weapons developed under Heinz Schmellenmeier, Richard Gans and Fritz Houtermans. They built an electron accelerator called Rheotron (invented by [[Max Steenbeck]] at [[Siemens-Schuckert]] in the 1930s, these were later called [[Betatron]]s by the Americans) to generate hard X-ray [[synchrotron]] beams for the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM). The intent was to pre-ionize ignition in aircraft engines and hence serve as anti-aircraft DEW and bring planes down into the reach of the FLAK. The Rheotron was captured by the Americans in Burggrub on April 14, 1945.

Another approach was Ernst Schiebolds 'Röntgenkanone' developed from 1943 in Großostheim near [[Aschaffenburg]]. The Company Richert Seifert &amp; Co from Hamburg delivered parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.main-netz.de/nachrichten/region/aschaffenburg/aschaffenburg-land/land/art3986,883119 |title=Forschungsstätte für Hitlers "Todesstrahlen" |publisher=Main-netz.de |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reported use in Sino-Soviet conflicts===
The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] informed [[Secretary of State|Secretary]] [[Henry Kissinger]] that it had twelve reports of Soviet forces using laser-based weapons against Chinese forces during the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|1969 Sino-Soviet border clashes]], though [[William Colby]] doubted that they had actually been employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80M01048A000800160004-5.pdf |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=October 29, 1974|access-date=September 20, 2017 |title=REPORTS OF USE OF LASER WEAPONS BY THE SOVIETS AGAINST THE CHINESE |last=Colby |first=William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategic Defense Initiative ===
In the 1980s, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] proposed the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) program, which was nicknamed ''[[Star Wars]]''. It suggested that lasers, perhaps space-based [[X-ray laser]]s, could destroy [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] in flight. Panel discussions on the role of high-power lasers in SDI took place at various laser conferences, during the 1980s, with the participation of noted physicists including [[Edward Teller]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C. P.  (Ed.), ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '85'' (STS, McLean, Va, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F. J. Duarte|Duarte, F. J.]]  (Ed.), [[The International Conference on Lasers and Applications, Lasers 'XX|''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '87'' (STS, McLean, Va, 1988)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the strategic missile defense concept has continued to the present under the [[Missile Defense Agency]], most of the directed-energy weapon concepts were shelved. However, Boeing has been somewhat successful with the [[Boeing YAL-1]] and [[Boeing NC-135]], the first of which destroyed two missiles in February 2010. Funding has been cut to both of the programs.

=== Iraq War ===

During the [[Iraq War]], electromagnetic weapons, including high power microwaves, were used by the U.S. military to disrupt and destroy Iraqi electronic systems and may have been used for crowd control. Types and magnitudes of exposure to electromagnetic fields are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;

===Alleged tracking of Space Shuttle ''Challenger''===
The [[Soviet Union]] invested some effort in the development of [[ruby laser|ruby]] and [[carbon dioxide laser]]s as anti-ballistic missile systems, and later as a tracking and anti-satellite system. There are reports that the [[Terra-3]] complex at [[Sary Shagan]] was used on several occasions to temporarily "blind" US spy satellites in the IR range.

It has been claimed (and proven false) that the USSR made use of the lasers at the Terra-3 site to target the Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=FAS&gt;{{cite web|last=Kononenko|first=Boris|title=Silent Space Is Being Monitored|url=https://fas.org/news/russia/1996/druma189_s96005.htm|accessdate=21 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210114952/http://www.fas.org/news/russia/1996/druma189_s96005.htm|archivedate=10 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jane's"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaloga|first=Steven|title=RED STAR WARS|url=http://www.oook.info/dyson/sdi.html|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the Soviet Union were concerned that the shuttle was being used as a reconnaissance platform. On 10 October 1984 ([[STS-41-G]]), the Terra-3 tracking laser was allegedly aimed at ''Challenger'' as it passed over the facility. Early reports claimed that this was responsible for causing "malfunctions on the space shuttle and distress to the crew", and that the United States filed a diplomatic protest about the incident.&lt;ref name=FAS/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jane's"/&gt; However, this story is comprehensively denied by the crew members of STS-41-G and knowledgeable members of the US intelligence community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sts41g.htm |title=STS-41-G |publisher=Astronautix.com |accessdate=2012-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620020803/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sts41g.htm |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-lethal weapons ==
The TECOM Technology Symposium in 1997 concluded on [[non-lethal weapons]], "determining the target effects on personnel is the greatest challenge to the testing community", primarily because  "the potential of injury and death severely limits human tests".&lt;ref&gt;
Human Effects Advisory Panel Program; presented to: NDIANon-Lethal Defense IV [https://web.archive.org/web/20041114161030/http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/nld4/kenny.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, "directed energy weapons that target the central nervous system and cause neurophysiological disorders may violate the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention of 1980. Weapons that go beyond non-lethal intentions and cause "superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering" may also violate the Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1977."&lt;ref&gt;

Some common bio-effects of non-lethal electromagnetic weapons include:
* Difficulty breathing
* [[Orientation (mental)|Disorientation]]
* [[Nausea]]
* [[Pain]]
* [[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]]
* Other systemic discomfort.
Interference with breathing poses the most significant, potentially lethal results.

Light and repetitive visual signals can induce [[epilepsy|epileptic]] seizures. [[Sensory illusions in aviation|Vection]] and [[motion sickness]] can also occur.

[[Pristina]] is the capital and the most populated city of [[Kosovo]]. It is also considered as the most polluted city in Kosovo. Basic reason for Pristina’s air pollution is [[coal mining]] and energy emitted by the single producer of energy, Kosovo Energy Corporation J.S.C. KEK operates through two power plants, Kosovo A and B located 5&amp;nbsp;km near Pristina. Furthermore, the diesel-spitting car traffic highly contributes to the pollution of air, along with the wood and coal household heating system and central coal-heating company "Termokos" that operates in Pristina.

==Air pollution in Pristina==
'''Main sources of air pollution in Pristina are''':
*Traffic – cars and busses in Pristina
*"Termokos" heating company
*Kosova A and B located near Pristina

'''Air in Pristina is polluted mainly from''':
*Particulate Matter – PM10, PM2.5(Dust)
*Gases – NO2, SO2, CO, O3

===Sources of air pollution===

====Gases====

'''NO{{sub|x}}'''

The main [[nitrogen oxide]] found in air in Pristina is nitrogen oxide NO2. NO affects the color of textile materials, causes corrosion in metallic materials, and at vegetation causes the drop of leaves; therefore, limit values are set. NO2 is 4 times more lethal than NO, and it is mostly concentrated in urban areas. NO2 in Pristina comes 52% from transport, 28% from fuel for power production, and 11% from industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Authors|first=Group|title=DIRECTIONS FOR REDUCING THE EMISSION OF POLLUTANTS  FROM MOTOR VEHICLES IN PRISTINE REGION|url=http://www.quality.unze.ba/zbornici/QUALITY%202011/128-Q11-198.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Pristina has a lower annual average of NO2 emission as compared to the annual average limit allowed.

Annual average of NO{{sub|2}} in Pristina

The annual average of NO{{sub|2}} emission in Pristina was 20.82&amp;nbsp;µg/m3 in 2010, which is lower than limit of 40&amp;nbsp;µg/m3. There are no available data for 2011, which would allow in turn comparing 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Authors|first=Group|title=State of the Air Reports|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/raporti_i_ajrit__anglisht_18122012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, this result comes from very low percentage of data collected, with only 68% of data being valid; this means that the emission of NO{{sub|2}}, may not be accurate. In the other hand, according to the National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo study, the emission of NO2 is alarming; in only three months of, NO2 measurement have exceeded allowed emissions by 18 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thinking Green|url=http://www.iksweb.org/repository/docs/enThinking_Green_274022.pdf|publisher=Iniciativa Kosovare per Stabilitet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The emission of NO{{sub|2}} is higher in winter, where the heating process is accelerated, with February being as the peak month. The main contributor to the pollution of air with NO{{sub|2}} is Kosovo A and B power plants. Thus, NO{{sub|2}} emission is estimated to be higher in urban areas where traffic is enormous. The good side of the story is that in Pristina there is no exceed of the NO{{sub|2}} limit that would cause health problems in people’s life; however, this does not apply for other cities of Pristina.

'''SO{{sub|2}}'''

Annual average values of SO{{sub|2}} in Pristina

The annual average of NO2 emission in Pristina was 20.82&amp;nbsp;µg/m3 in 2010, which is lower than limit of 40&amp;nbsp;µg/m3. There are no available data for 2011, which would allow in turn comparing 2010 and 2011.

'''CO{{sub|2}}'''

[[File:Prishtina në perëndim të diellit.jpg|thumb|500px|Prishtina në perëndim të diellit]]

Vehicles and fuel burning companies are the main CO{{sub|2}} pollutants of air in Pristina. Fuel burning contains liquid fuels, natural gas and wood, combustion of coal, and industrial processes such as furnaces, paper factories, the refineries, and facilities for production of construction materials. CO{{sub|2}} emission in air can be mitigated through plants; however, this is another problem in Pristina. The lack of green spaces and well-maintained parks makes impossible the mitigation of CO{{sub|2}}. The highest pollutant is the production of energy, with its annual CO{{sub|2}} contribution to global warming is 5.5 million tons.   CO{{sub|2}} pollution comes 30% from fuel use for power generation, 29% from transport, 20% from industry, 15% from residential commerce, and 6% from other sources. 
If Pristina is compared with regional countries, it is noticed that Pristina exceeds the OSCE and EU emissions of CO{{sub|2}}.  Pristina has higher emission of CO2 compared to the region of Serbia, and lower emissions compared to the region of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

====Particulate Matter (Dust)====

PM emission on air comes mainly from transport in Pristina. In the road transportation, this comes mainly from cars and tires. The problem relies in the intensive increase of automobiles in Pristina, where most of them are old and do not possess catalysts. Pristina’s cars life span differs from 5 years to more than 15 years. 7.5% of registered cars are newer than 5 years old, 77.36% are older than 10 years, and 66.82% of them are more than 15 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baxhaku|first=Bashkim|title=DIRECTIONS FOR REDUCING THE EMISSION OF POLLUTANTS  FROM MOTOR VEHICLES IN PRISTINE REGION|url=http://www.quality.unze.ba/zbornici/QUALITY%202011/128-Q11-198.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, each day in Pristina enter an enormous number of cars, creating traffic as well as air pollution. Out of the total number of vehicles registered in Kosovo, 31.18% of them are registered in Pristina; 84% are passenger’s vehicles, 13% are from transporting, and the others come mainly from urban traffic. The public transportation in Pristina contains mainly busses exported from other countries. There are 757 licensed buses routes per day and out of these 382 are executed on average per day. Buses/minibuses connecting urban and suburban areas total 151with 935 departures per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dobruna|first=Aida|title=LOW CARBON Pristina, MISSION IM(POSSIBLE)?!|url=http://www.isocarp.net/data/case_studies/1616.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are two main stations in Pristina that measure the air pollution: Kosovo Hydro Meteorological Institute   and "Rilindja."

As it can be seen from the table that the maximum amount allowed to be exceeded with PM10, is 35 days and the maximum daily value is 50&amp;nbsp;µg/m3. However, according to KHMI, Pristina has exceeded this limit for 99 days in 2010 and for 68 days in 2011. The majority of days with exceedance of average daily values were during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Authors|first=Group|title=State of Air Report|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/raporti_i_ajrit__anglisht_18122012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The table below presents PM{{sub|10}} maximum, minimum, and average monthly values, where November is the month with the highest recorded PM{{sub|10}} value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tahirsylaj|first=Syle|title=Quality of Air in Urban and suburban Area's of the Pristina's and  Meteorological Impact Conditions in Distribution of Pollution|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/zanran_storage/balwois.com/ContentPages/78546993.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual limit of (40&amp;nbsp;µg/m3)14 was also exceeded in 2010 and 2011, as it can be seen from figure 2. The highest pollution value reached from traffic in Pristina was estimated to be 75.74&amp;nbsp;µg/m3, which is 1.9 times more than the average annual limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Authors|first=Group|title=State of the Air Report|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/raporti_i_ajrit__anglisht_18122012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual Average of PM{{sub|2.5}}

The average annual emission of PM{{sub|2.5}} is 25&amp;nbsp;µg/m3. However, Pristina has exceeded this limit in 2010 and 2011. Furthermore, the PM{{sub|2.5}} concentration has increased from 37.34&amp;nbsp;µg/m3 in 2010 to 40.40&amp;nbsp;µg/m3in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Authors|first=Group|title=State of the Air Report|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/raporti_i_ajrit__anglisht_18122012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest value of PM2.5 has been recorded in the winter months, with November leading among other months.

====Kosova A and B Power Plants====

[[File:KEK plants - Obiliq.jpg|thumb|500px|KEK plants - Obiliq]]

Kosovo A and B power plant are the number one pollutant of Pristina. It is the primary factor contributing to the pollution of air with the above-mentioned gasses. Kosovo A and B power plant produce 97% of the energy used in Pristina, while only 3% comes from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Authors|first=Group|title=Measurements of Emission of Gases SO2, NOx, CO and CO2 from the  Burning Process in the Furnaces of Power Plant "Kosova B"|url=http://www.jieas.com/volumes/vol101-2/abs10-v5-i2-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Kosovo Energy Corporation is the main polluter in Pristina region. There is no continuous emission monitoring system from those two plants. However, lower emissions have been reported in Kosovo B compared to Kosovo A. Kosovo A has three blocks, A{{sub|1}}, A{{sub|3}}, A{{sub|5}}, and Kosovo B has two blocks B{{sub|1}} and B{{sub|2}}. According to the state report for environmental conditions in Kosovo, both power plants have exceeded the SO{{sub|2}} limit in air, that of 400&amp;nbsp;mg/Nm3, and the NO{{sub|2}} limit that of 500&amp;nbsp;mg/Nm3, and dust emission limit that of 50&amp;nbsp;mg/Nm3. CO{{sub|2}} emission from A is lower from power plant B, as it can be seen in the table below.

CO{{sub|2}} emissions from power plant A and B in Pristina

Electro filters are planned to be established in A{{sub|3}}, A{{sub|4}} and A{{sub|5}} with the aim to increase the efficiency of the existing electro filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raport per Gjendjen e Mjedisit|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Raporti_Gjendja_e_Mjedisit_Web_Shqip.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as it can be seen, KEDS CO{{sub|2}} emissions are more than 6 million tons annually, which means 520 tons per hour. 
When KEDS produces at full capacity (200 MW), it emits 25 tons of dust and ash (that includes gases) per hour, which is 74 times more than the European limit. Critical months are April, June, July, October, November and December, where the emission of gases and dust exceeds the limit allowed.

'''Facts from Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning in Kosovo''':

"Greenhouse gasses: 10,797,000 tons of CO{{sub|2}} and 425,000 t of CH{{sub|4}}"
"CO emissions: 986,000 tons"
"Dust emissions: 167,000 t with specific values from 1,881mg/m{{sup|3}} to 7,523 mg/m{{sup|3}} at Kosovo A and 250 mg/m{{sup|3}} at Kosovo B"
"SO{{sub|2}} emissions: 167,000 t with specific values of 895 mg/m{{sup|3}}"
"NO{{sub|x}} Emission: 20,000 t with specific values from 358 mg/m{{sup|3}} to 478 mg/m{{sup|3}} at Kosovo A and 735 mg/m{{sup|3}} at Kosovo B."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air  pollution from lignite -- based electricity generation in Kosovo|url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/pdf/sap/2006/graz/presentations/04-03.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Ministry of Environment has concluded that the problem with dust emitted from those two power plants is serious and it cannot be avoided without major redesign of the boilers. Units in Kosovo A need serious assessment since they are at the end of their lifespan. On the other hand, Kosovo B has a longer lifespan, but the existing electrostatic precipitator is in very bad conditions and also there is low control of dust emission in the air.  European Union has set some targets that those power plants reach by 2017. Dust emission should be max 50&amp;nbsp;mg/Nm{{sup|3}}, SO{{sub|2}} max 400&amp;nbsp;mg/Nm{{sup|3}}, and NO{{sub|2}} max 500&amp;nbsp;mg/Nm{{sup|3}}.

Emissions released from Power Plants A and B

====Termokos and Household Heating====

Heating company "Termokos" covers most of the neighborhoods in Pristina. This company operates with oil and gas, while the cogeneration system is considered to be a very stable solution for the improvement of the heating system in Pristina. However, Termokoscovers only three main cities in Kosovo, 3-4% of households in general are heated from it. 
There are some problems related with Termokos:

*	Loss of water / energy during distribution 
*	No coverage of entire city with central heating 
*	No use of energy alternatives such as solar heating 
*	Pollutants emitted in the air

SO{{sub|2}} pollution from Termokos

As it can be seen in the table Termokos releases 491&amp;nbsp;mg/Nm{{sup|3}}, while the limit, as stated before is 400&amp;nbsp;mg/Nm{{sup|3}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air  pollution from lignite -- based electricity generation in Kosovo|url=http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/pdf/sap/2006/graz/presentations/04-03.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, it can be noticed that Termokos is one of the main pollutants of Pristina.
Households in Pristina use mainly wood for heating. Oftentimes, households use old sofa that do not use filters, and the pollutants end up in the air. This problem could be avoided if the central heating problem would be solved, so that Termokos could supply with heating each house in Pristina region. This in turn would disincentivize people to secure heating materials on their own, which in turn would decrease the air pollution as well.

==Water Contamination==

Pristina City has limited quantities of surface and groundwater, which are mainly distributed in the peripheral areas. A small fraction of the available water is found as underground water, such as that in "Pajtimi" field that amounts to 50 liters / sec and "Germia" source that amounts to     15 liters /sec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plani Zhvillimor Urban i Prishtines 2013-2023|url=|publisher=Kuvendi Komunal i Prishtines}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Watercourses are scarce. There are small rivers in the urban area, such as Pristina and Vellusha Rivers that collect the water flows of faux pas coming from Lagjia e Spitalit, Mati, Kodra e Trimave, and Shkabaj.
Vellusha and Pristina Rivers serve to collect rainwater from all urban areas of Pristina. The main drinking water sources remain Batllava and Badovc Lakes. 
Batllava Lake – it has a capacity of 38 million m³ of water and supplies the town of Pristina with 65% of drinking water. Batllava represents the main source of drinking water for the municipality of Pristina. It was built in 1960-1963; initially it worked only for technical water supply to the energy complex in Obilic. From 1982 it turned into water resource for drinking water for the Pristina region. Recently, the water treatment plant in Shajkovc was built, which has a maximum capacity of 900 liters/sec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plani Zhvillimor Urban i Prishtines 2013-2023 |url=file:///C:/Users/lorezq/Desktop/Wiki%20Academy/PZHU_Pjesa%20Tekstuale.pdf |publisher=Kuvendi Komunal i Prishtines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812155911/http://c/ |archivedate=2013-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Badovci Lake- has a volume of 27 million m³ and supplies the town of Pristina with 35% of drinking water. It was initially built in 1960 for the supply of drinking water, irrigation, and technical water for Kishnica mine. From1980 this lake is mainly used for drinking water purposes for Pristina region. The water treatment plant has been built in Badovc, which has a maximum capacity 400l/sec.
Those two lakes are the main source of water in Pristine. They both supply around 90% of population in Pristina region with drinking water. However, the distribution power has many problems. Most of the pipes used are older than 50 years, which lose around 50% of available water; 35% are technical losses, while 15% are commercial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plani Zhvillimor Urban i Prishtines 2013-2023 |url=file:///C:/Users/lorezq/Desktop/Wiki%20Academy/PZHU_Pjesa%20Tekstuale.pdf |publisher=Kuvendi Komunal i Prishtines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812155911/http://c/ |archivedate=2013-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result there are reductions on available water to citizens, with 8-10 hours/day water cuts to each household. 
Another problem is the water contamination. There is no urban water monitoring in Kosovo. There are only some small regional, water companies that do not have large competencies on water monitoring. Wastewater discharges remain the main pollutants of water in Pristina. Those wastes are dangerous because they contain substances such as soluble compounds of phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, pathogenic bacteria and viruses, nitrogen (eutrophication), and other matters that affect the water quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of Water in Kosovo|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/raporti_ujerave_2010-angl.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Main carrier of underground waters pollution is Prishtevka River, which at the same time is the main carrier of sewage and rainwater.

===Waste in water===

There are two main pollutants of water in Pristina: collective pollutants and industrial pollutants. Collective pollutants are households and individuals that throw waste in water and have common canalization system. Industrial pollutants are the largest industrial pollutants, such as agriculture, chemicals, and ironmongery pollutants. There are 6 individual pollutants in Prishtevka River, and 1 collective pollutant. There are 15 collective pollutants in Llapi River, and 7 individual pollutants. Sitnica River has 24 collective pollutants and 7 individual pollutants, and Gracanka River has 3 collective pollutants, and 1 individual pollutant. The table below shows the individualpollutants in Pristina and their landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadastri i Ndotësve  të Ujërave të Kosovës|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Kadastri_i_ndotesve__te_ujerave_Shq.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Water Pollutants in Pristina

===Sewage waters===

The city of Pristina has the system of moving sewage water out of the center of Pristina, but it does not have the system of continuing maintenance of sewage waters. The movement of sewage waters is done toward rivers in Pristina, mainly on Sitnica River. Sitnica is the main receiver of sewage waters coming from citizens of Pristina. The total amount of water discharged into Sitnica from urban area is 800liters/sec, from which 450liter/sec are taken through Pristina River and 150 liters/sec through Vellushariver. Other amounts are taken through Shkabajfaux pas. There are only 8 settlements in Pristina with public or own canalization system. The table below presents main regions of Pristina and their landfills of sewage waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadastri i Ndotësve  të Ujërave të Kosovës|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Kadastri_i_ndotesve__te_ujerave_Shq.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water pollutants in Pristina

As it can be seen from the table, the main polluted river with most sewage waters flows on it is Prishtevka. It can be said that Prishtevka has turned into a river flow of sewage waters, withmore than 400,000 inhabitants polluting it.  
Another big problem is with sewage waters that are present in Taukbashçe Park, which besides the fact that they are polluted and are part of the park, they also smell horrible for people who visit the park. This may cause health problem to people, given the fact that elderly people are those that visit this park mostly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ujërat e zeza në Taukbashçe!|date=3 January 2014|url=http://www.prishtina.com/komuna-e-prishtines/-uj-rat-e-zeza-n-taukbash-e-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground Waters===

Considering the problem of Pristina to supply its citizens with water, underground water has been thought to be a rescue for this problem. Kolevica underground waters have been the main supplier of water for Pristina from 1950 to 1970. Those waters are placed in the northern side of Pristina, with a maximum capacity of 50 liters/sec. However, with the construction of Batllava River, those underground rivers were left unused, and now they form part of the polluted waters in Pristina. 
Germia Source is another underground water resource that lies in Germia Park ad is the oldest water sources known. It has been used many years ago, and it has a flow of 15 liters/sec. This source is used for GermiaBasis,while those days Germia’s underground waters are considered to be the main source of water for Pristina citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plani Zhvillimor Urban i Prishtines 2013-2023 |url=file:///C:/Users/lorezq/Desktop/Wiki%20Academy/PZHU_Pjesa%20Tekstuale.pdf |publisher=Kuvendi Komunal i Prishtines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812155911/http://c/ |archivedate=2013-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wells in Pristina===

There are hidden wells{{Clarify|dated=February 2015; are these aquifers|date=February 2015}} in Pristina, which most of them are covered with waste and are in the most polluted areas of Pristina. These sources are used when surface water is lacking. Recently, water has been found in "Pajtimi" field, which currently is one of the waste polluted areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Puset në Fushën e Pajtimit do të rifunksionalizohen shumë shpejt|date=19 February 2014|url=http://www.botasot.info/kosova/274791/puset-ne-fushen-e-pajtimit-do-te-rifunksionalizohen-shume-shpejt/}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, in an attempt to clean Pristina environment, and also find water, the opening phase of these wells has started and they are estimated to be completed by mid-2014. In this place, 9 wells are found, and the flow is estimated at 60 liters/sec. 
There are two other wells in Llukar village. Those wells are estimated to have a flow of 50 liters/sec. The problem with those two wells is their usage, mainly for auto washing. Those wells ceased being used in 1989, and they are expected to become active again by mid-2014. 
A plan to plant trees in Pristina and lower air pollution, has prompted that 17 artificial wells to be opened in Pristina. The Pristina municipal government has provided funding for these wells, which would supply the water the irrigation of the newly planted trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rexhepi|first=Kaltrina|title=17 Puset e Komunës për Gjelbërimin e Prishtinës|date=September 2013|url=http://www.gazetajnk.com/?cid=1,1018,6422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste==

The region of Pristina is the highest waste container. In 2007, 61.644.35 ton of waste have been collected only in Pristina, while in 2008, 80.185.06	 ton of waste have been collected in Pristina.

Waste Collection in Pristina 2007 and 2008

[[File:Pano pristina noche2.jpg|thumb|500px|Pano pristina noche2]]

The average amount of municipal waste disposal in Pristina is 0.9&amp;nbsp;kg/day per person, while 332&amp;nbsp;kg/year per person. If Pristina is compared with other municipalities, it can be seen that Pristina differs much more. While in Pristina the average waste disposal is 332&amp;nbsp;kg/year per person, in other municipalities this average is 95&amp;nbsp;kg/year per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendja e Mbeturinave|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/2Raporti_i_mbeturinave_2008.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem relies in the disposal of this waste is done in (field-waste) municipal surface. Those waste disposals have not filled the minimum standard requirements for waste. They are settled near habitats and rivers, which most of time end up polluting the rivers also, especially underground waters and wells. Oftentimes those waste disposals are burned from nature, as well as from people. During summer they smell badly because most of waste is not even covered with grit. Some disposals in Pristina have been closed, with the aim to reduce those negative effects in the nature; however, still most of them remain uncovered. 
Pristina regional waste disposal collects waste from Prishtinë, Obiliq, Lipjan, Fushë	Kosovë and Drenas(Gllogoc). The size of this disposal is approximately 40 hectares, it has a lide span of 15 years, and its total capacity is 3,500,000 m{{sup|3}} while its monthly capacity is 6000 tons. The status of this disposal is miserable, with a very bad smell causing many health implications to people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendja e Mbeturinave|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/2Raporti_i_mbeturinave_2008.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Waste===

As the capital city of Kosovo, Pristina has the largest number of inhabitants, which in turn means that it has the largest amount of waste disposal. Generation, collection, treatment, and elimination of waste in Pristinais done by "Pastrimi" Company, which covers the highest percentage of people with this service compared to other municipalities. In 2007 this company covered 64% of the population with this service, in 2008 52%, in 2009 53%, and in 2010 55%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendja e Mbeturinave|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/2Raporti_i_mbeturinave_2008.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection of waste is done through two ways: 52% door-to-door collection and 48% for collective apartments.

Waste collection in Pristina

In 2012, local yearly waste per capita was 515&amp;nbsp;kg, while daily waste per capita was 1.4&amp;nbsp;kg. The total amount of waste collected in Pristina is 248,832 ton. (cite 37)
The collection of local waste in Pristina has increased from 2007 to 2012. In 2007 182,000 ton were collected, while in 2012 249,000 ton were collected. This is an example of an increase in the efficiency of waste collection. If Pristina is compared with the other regions, the collection of waste per capita is much higher. Only in 2012, the difference between Pristina and other regions collection of waste was 0.7&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anketa e Mbeturinave Komunale 2012|url=https://esk.rks-gov.net/mjedisi/publikimet/doc_view/1075-anketa-e-mbeturinave-komunale-2012?tmpl=component&amp;format=raw|publisher=Kosovo Agency of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Waste===

Industrial waste contains substances in various aggregate forms that remained for a long time in different facilities, warehouses, and industrial units.Over time, the usage of some of these substances has expired or degraded by changing their composition, making them as highly hazardous substances for people’s health.

Industrial Waste in Pristina

As it can be seen, Kosovo A power plant is one of the largest pollutants with industrial waste, followed by Kishnica Laboratory.

===Medicinal Waste===
This type of waste includes medicinal pills whose usage is not valid anymore. This sector in Pristina does not have a system of collection, transportation, or elimination. Even though, new waste disposals have been set in hospital as well as in medicinal family centers, they are not being used as much. Medicinal pills are thrown in normal waste disposals. When medicinal pills stay for a long time without valid usage time, then they release dangerous substances for human’s health. The Municipal Family Medicine Center in Pristina releases 60 tons/year medicinal waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendja e Mbeturinave|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/2Raporti_i_mbeturinave_2008.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Medicinal waste is found also in some pharmacies in Pristina. The central pharmacy of Pristina has declared 200&amp;nbsp;kg of medical waste. Other pharmacies have also reported medical waste, such as Agani Warehouse.

==Land Degradation==

The continued impact of human activities on land causes [[land degradation]], which is harmful for human and socio-economic environment. Since Pristina is the capital city of Kosovo, most of the population lives here. This means that land degradation issue is more present in the Pristina region; however, Pristina was always industrial-oriented city, with less agricultural land used for food cultivation. Land degradation happens because of the increased construction of settlements (unplanned constructions), road construction, industry (solid waste, surface mining), local and sanitary waste, erosion and uncontrolled exploitation of gravel.

===Land Usage===

Below are some facts for land usage in Pristina Municipality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plani Zhvillimor Urban i Prishtines 2013-2023 |url=file:///C:/Users/lorezq/Desktop/Wiki%20Academy/PZHU_Pjesa%20Tekstuale.pdf |publisher=Kuvendi Komunal i Prishtines |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812155911/http://c/ |archivedate=2013-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Constructed Land: 2365.6 hectares or 30.45% of the total surface

Residential Areas: 2011.58 hectares. It is characterized with individual residence 23.17%, with only 2.72% collective residence.
 
'''Economic Areas''': 217.94 hectares or 2.81% of total constructed areas belongs to the industrial development.

'''Educational Institutions''': occupy a surface of 34.7 hectares or 0.45% of the constructed area

'''Health Institutions''':  occupy a surface of 33.9 hectares or 0.44% of the constructed area

'''Administrative Institutions''': occupy a surface of 50.08 hectares or 0.64% of the constructed area

'''Green Areas''': 5023.05 hectares or 64.04% of the total area

'''Specific Areas''': 149.11 hectares or 1.92% of the total area

'''Transport and Traffic Areas''': 231 hectares or 2.97% of total area

Ownership in Pristina Municipality is divided into two groups:

'''Public Ownership''': 2695.21 hectares or 34.7%

'''Private Ownership''': 5073.48 hectares or 65.3%

===Degradation of Agricultural Land===

Pristina has 9155 hectares of agricultural land, from which 8508 hectares have the system of irrigation on them. Since Pristina has a much polluted air, then it tis thought that this emission of pollution be transferred from air to land. This happens through rainfall that dissolves air pollution and deposits it into the land. 
One of the most common ways of agricultural land degradation is the transformation of agricultural land into industrial land.  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development, in the period from 1998-2006 1 hectare of land in Pristina was transformed. However, the construction of Pristina started the last five years, with more people building apartments in each neighborhood of Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gjendja e Mbeturinave|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/2Raporti_i_mbeturinave_2008.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The problem of land degradation is that it happens in both ways: through the permition of the municipality of Pristina, but also without the permission of the municipality of Pristina. According to the director of the agricultural association in Kosovo, land degradation is happening each day more and more, and the most dangerous zones to remain without agricultural land are lands between Pristina and Skopje highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tokat bujqësore janë degraduar|url=http://www.telegrafi.com/ekonomi/tokat-bujqesore-jane-degraduar-46-15443.html|publisher=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws on land degradation===

==Spatial Planning==

Spatial planning in Pristina is very important, given the enormous construction plans happening currently. The construction of collective apartments has started in Pristina the last five years, and some of them follow the directives for constructing from Pristina Municipality, but others do not. However, when dealing with spatial planning, it is very important to protect local zones from construction, especially parks that people use for recreational activities. One of the natural spatial areas protected from the municipality of Pristina is the national park "Germia."

===Protected zones - Germia===

[[File:-Germia national park Prishtina 2014-01-29 12-19.jpg|thumb|500px|-Germia national park Pristina 2014-01-29 12-19]]

The regional park "Germia" is protected and monitored from the public enterprise "Hortikultura." This park is protected from construction, as well as because of its biodiversity in fauna and flora. Germia lies in the northern part of Pristina and it has a surface of 62 km2. 
The boundaries of Germia starts with vineyards fields in the west, continues with Miredita hills in the east toward the Hajvalia mining and Gracanica River. In the South it continues with Busise River, and in the east it ends up with Badovci River. Besides of its geographic boundaries, Germia is protected because of its diversity in flora and fauna. 610 types of vascular flora have been found in Germia separated into 82 families. 83 types of mushrooms have been found and 4 forest communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VLERAT E TRASHËGIMISË  NATYRORE TË KOSOVËS|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Vlerat_e_trashegimis_natyrore_te_Kosoves.pdf|publisher=INSTITUTI I KOSOVËS PËR MBROJTJEN E NATYRËS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
It is the only place of Pristina where the air pollution is lower, and most of people use it as a recreational place. 41.40.52 hectares of Germia are under the protected zone, starting from the Germia Basis and continue with fields, children parks and toys, and sporting centers.
The status of Germia is a Protected Regional Park, including 1.126.01.00 hectares. Germia Park is evidenced as a protected zone in the international list of protected places.

==Environmental Protection Measures==

During 2011-2012 the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning in Kosovo, has formulated the Strategy for the protection of the Environment in Pristina. Those strategies have been created for the future of Pristina environment in 2015-2022. Those strategies entail specific plans and EU standards that Pristina needs to fulfill by the end of year 2022. 
Local Plans for Environmental Actions are mandatory for each municipality in Kosovo. In Pristina this plan has been approved and it only waits for the starting period of implementation. This plan has been taken in cooperation with the Swedish Agence for International Development. The municipality of Pristina is developing and implementing this plan for other municipalities as well. 
14 plans have been established for waste management in Pristina, according to the Kosovo Law for Waste.

[[File:Tijdvereffening-equation of time-en.jpg|thumb|right|310px|This graph uses the opposite sign to the one above it. There is no universally followed convention for the sign of the equation of time.]]

The '''equation of time''' describes the discrepancy between two kinds of [[solar time]]. The word ''equation'' is used in the medieval sense of "reconcile a difference". The two times that differ are the ''apparent'' solar time, which directly tracks the [[diurnal motion]] of the [[Sun]], and ''mean'' solar time, which tracks a theoretical [[mean]] Sun with [[noon]]s 24 hours apart. Apparent solar time can be obtained by measurement of the current position ([[Hour angle#Solar hour angle|hour angle]]) of the Sun, as indicated (with limited accuracy) by a [[sundial]]. ''Mean'' solar time, for the same place, would be the time indicated by a steady clock set so that over the year its differences from apparent solar time would resolve to zero.&lt;ref name=Maskelyne&gt;''Nautical Almanac'' 1767&lt;/ref&gt;

The equation of time is the east or west component of the [[analemma]], a curve representing the angular offset of the Sun from its mean position on the [[celestial sphere]] as viewed from Earth. The equation of time values for each day of the year, compiled by astronomical [[observatory|observatories]], were widely listed in [[almanac]]s and [[ephemeris|ephemerides]].&lt;ref name="Milham"&gt;Milham 1945, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;See for example, British Commission on Longitude 1794, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
[[File:L' equazione del tempo. Foro Carolino in piazza Dante, Napoli.jpg|thumb|Clock with auxiliary dial displaying the equation of time. Piazza Dante, [[Naples]] (1853).]]
During a year the equation of time varies as shown on the graph; its change from one year to the next is slight. Apparent time, and the sundial, can be ahead (fast) by as much as 16&amp;nbsp;[[minute|min]]&amp;nbsp;33&amp;nbsp;[[second|s]] (around 3&amp;nbsp;November), or behind (slow) by as much as 14&amp;nbsp;min&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;s (around 12&amp;nbsp;February). The equation of time has zeros near 15&amp;nbsp;April, 13&amp;nbsp;June, 1&amp;nbsp;September and 25&amp;nbsp;December. Ignoring very slow changes in the Earth's orbit and rotation, these events are repeated at the same times every [[tropical year]]. However, due to the non-integer number of days in a year, these dates can vary by a day or so from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;As an example of the inexactness of the dates, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory's ''Multiyear Interactive Computer Almanac'' the equation of time was zero at 02:00 [[UT1]] on 16&amp;nbsp;April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The graph of the equation of time is closely approximated by the sum of two sine curves, one with a period of a year and one with a period of half a year. The curves reflect two astronomical effects, each causing a different non-uniformity in the apparent daily motion of the Sun relative to the stars:

* the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the [[ecliptic]] (the plane of the Earth's annual orbital motion around the Sun), which is inclined by about 23.44 degrees relative to the plane of the Earth's [[equator]]; and
* the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun, which is about 0.0167.

The equation of time is [[constant function|constant]] only for a planet with zero [[axial tilt]] and zero [[orbital eccentricity]]. On [[Mars]] the difference between sundial time and clock time can be as much as 50&amp;nbsp;minutes, due to the considerably greater eccentricity of its orbit. The planet [[Uranus]], which has an extremely large axial tilt, has an equation of time that makes its days start and finish several hours earlier or later depending on where it is in its orbit.

==Sign of the equation of time==
There is no universally accepted definition of the [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] of the equation of time. Some publications show it as positive when a sundial is ahead of a clock, as shown in the upper graph above; others when the clock is ahead of the sundial, as shown in the lower graph. In the English-speaking world, the former usage is the more common, but is not always followed. Anyone who makes use of a published table or graph should first check its sign usage. Often, there is a note or caption which explains it. Otherwise, the sign can be determined by knowing that, during the first three months of each year, the clock is ahead of the sundial. The [[mnemonic]] "NYSS" (pronounced "nice"), for "new year, sundial slow", can be useful. Some published tables avoid the ambiguity by not using signs, but by showing phrases such as "sundial fast" or "sundial slow" instead.&lt;ref name="Waugh, p.&amp;nbsp;205"&gt;Waugh, p.&amp;nbsp;205&lt;/ref&gt;

In this article, and others in English Wikipedia, a positive value of the equation of time implies that a sundial is ahead of a clock.

==History==
The phrase "equation of time" is derived from the [[medieval Latin]] ''aequātiō diērum'', meaning "equation of days" or "difference of days". The word ''aequātiō'' was widely used in early astronomy to tabulate the difference between an observed value and the expected value (as in the equation of centre, the equation of the equinoxes, the equation of the epicycle).  The difference between apparent solar time and mean time was recognized by astronomers since antiquity, but prior to the invention of accurate mechanical clocks in the mid-17th century, [[sundial]]s were the only reliable timepieces, and apparent solar time was the generally accepted standard. Mean time did not supplant apparent time in national almanacs and ephemerides until the early 19th century. {{sfn| McCarthy| Seidelmann| 2009| page=9}}

A description of apparent and mean time was given by [[Nevil Maskelyne]] in the ''Nautical Almanac'' for 1767: "Apparent Time is that deduced immediately from the Sun, whether from the Observation of his passing the Meridian, or from his observed [[Sunrise|Rising]] or [[Sunset|Setting]].  This Time is different from that shewn by Clocks and Watches well regulated at Land, which is called equated or mean Time." He went on to say that, at sea, the apparent time found from observation of the Sun must be corrected by the equation of time, if the observer requires the mean time.&lt;ref name=Maskelyne/&gt;

The right time was originally considered to be that which was shown by a sundial. When good mechanical clocks were introduced, they agreed with sundials only near four dates each year, so the equation of time was used to "correct" their readings to obtain sundial time. Some clocks, called [[equation clock]]s, included an internal mechanism to perform this "correction". Later, as clocks became the dominant good timepieces, uncorrected clock time, i.e., "mean time", became the accepted standard. The readings of sundials, when they were used, were then, and often still are, corrected with the equation of time, used in the reverse direction from previously, to obtain clock time. Many sundials, therefore, have tables or graphs of the equation of time engraved on them to allow the user to make this correction.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The equation of time was used historically to [[wikt:clocksetter|set clocks]]. Between the invention of accurate clocks in 1656 and the advent of commercial time distribution services around 1900, there were three common land-based ways to set clocks. Firstly, in the unusual event of having an astronomer present, the sun's transit across the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] (the moment the sun passed overhead) was noted, the clock was then set to noon and offset by the number of minutes given by the equation of time for that date.  Secondly, and much more commonly, a sundial was read, a table of the equation of time (usually engraved on the dial) was consulted and the watch or clock set accordingly. These calculated the mean time, albeit local to a point of [[longitude]]. The third method did not use the equation of time; instead, it used [[wikt:star|stellar]] observations to give [[sidereal time]], exploiting the relationship between sidereal time and [[mean solar time]].&lt;ref&gt;Olmstead 1866, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, the equation of time can still be used, when required, to obtain apparent solar time from clock time. Devices such as [[solar tracker]]s, which move to keep pace with the Sun's movements in the sky, frequently do not include sensors to determine the Sun's position. Instead, they are controlled by a clock mechanism, along with a mechanism that incorporates the equation of time to make the device keep pace with the Sun.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

===Ancient history—Babylon and Egypt===
The irregular daily movement of the Sun was known by the Babylonians. Book III of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' is primarily concerned with the Sun's anomaly, and he tabulated the equation of time in his ''Handy Tables''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto Neugebauer | date = 1975 | title = A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy | publisher = Springer-Verlag | publication-place = New York / Heidelberg / Berlin | pages = 984–986 | isbn = 0-387-06995-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy discusses the correction needed to convert the meridian crossing of the Sun to mean solar time and takes into consideration the nonuniform motion of the Sun along the ecliptic and the meridian correction for the Sun's ecliptic longitude. He states the maximum correction is {{frac|8|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;time-degrees or {{frac|5|9}} of an hour (Book III, chapter 9).&lt;ref&gt;Toomer 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;171&lt;/ref&gt; However he did not consider the effect to be relevant for most calculations since it was negligible for the slow-moving luminaries and only applied it for the fastest-moving luminary, the Moon.

===Medieval and Renaissance astronomy===
Based on Ptolemy's discussion in the [[Almagest]], medieval Islamic astronomers such as [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|al-Khwarizmi]], [[al-Battani]], [[Kushyar Gilani|Kushyar ibn Labban]], [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] and others, made improvements to the solar tables and the value of obliquity, and published tables of the equation of time (''taʿdīl al-ayyām bi layālayhā'') in their ''zij'' (astronomical tables).&lt;ref&gt;E.S. Kennedy, "A Survey of Islamic Astronomical Tables", ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', '''46''', Part&amp;nbsp;2 (1956), p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, the next substantial improvement in the computation didn't come until Kepler's final upset of the geocentric astronomy of the ancients.  [[Gerald J. Toomer]] uses the medieval term "equation" from the Latin ''aequātiō''{{refn|equalization (adjustment)|group= n}}, for Ptolemy's difference between the mean solar time and the apparent solar time. [[Johannes Kepler]]'s definition of the equation is "the difference between the number of degrees and minutes of the mean anomaly and the degrees and minutes of the corrected anomaly."&lt;ref&gt;Kepler 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apparent time versus local mean time===
{{See also|Equation clock}}
Until the invention of the pendulum and the development of reliable clocks during the 17th century, the equation of time as defined by Ptolemy remained a curiosity, of importance only to astronomers. However, when mechanical clocks started to take over timekeeping from sundials, which had served humanity for centuries, the difference between clock time and sundial time became an issue for everyday life. [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|Apparent solar time]] is the time indicated by the Sun on a sundial (or measured by its transit over a preferred local meridian), while ''mean solar time'' is the average as indicated by well-regulated clocks. The first tables to give the equation of time in an essentially correct way were published in 1665 by [[Christiaan Huygens]].&lt;ref&gt;Huygens, 1665&lt;/ref&gt; Huygens, following the tradition of Ptolemy and medieval astronomers in general, set his values for the equation of time so as to make all values positive throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;Huygens 1665&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This meant that any clock being set to mean time by Huygens's tables was consistently about 15&amp;nbsp;minutes slow compared to today's mean time.|group= n}}

Another set of tables was published in 1672–73 by [[John Flamsteed]], who later became the first [[Astronomer Royal]] of the new [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. These appear to have been the first essentially correct tables that gave today's meaning of Mean Time (rather than mean time based on the latest sunrise of the year as proposed by Huygens). Flamsteed adopted the convention of tabulating and naming the correction in the sense that it was to be applied to the apparent time to give mean time.&lt;ref&gt;Flamsteed 1672&lt;/ref&gt;

The equation of time, correctly based on the two major components of the Sun's irregularity of apparent motion,{{refn|See above|group= n}} was not generally adopted until after Flamsteed's tables of 1672–73, published with the posthumous edition of the works of [[Jeremiah Horrocks]].&lt;ref&gt;Vince 1814, p.&amp;nbsp;49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hooke]] (1635–1703), who mathematically analyzed the [[universal joint]], was the first to note that the geometry and mathematical description of the (non-secular) equation of time and the universal joint were identical, and proposed the use of a universal joint in the construction of a "mechanical sundial".&lt;ref&gt;Mills 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;219&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th and early 19th centuries===
The corrections in Flamsteed's tables of 1672–1673 and 1680 gave mean time computed essentially correctly and without need for further offset. But the numerical values in tables of the equation of time have somewhat changed since then, owing to three factors:
* general improvements in accuracy that came from refinements in astronomical measurement techniques,
* slow intrinsic changes in the equation of time, occurring as a result of small long-term changes in the Earth's obliquity and eccentricity (affecting, for instance, the distance and dates of [[perihelion]]), and
* the inclusion of small sources of additional variation in the apparent motion of the Sun, unknown in the 17th century, but discovered from the 18th century onwards, including the effects of the Moon{{refn|See [[barycentre]]|group= n}}, Venus and Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Maskelyne 1764, pp.&amp;nbsp;163–169&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Derby Sundial C 5810.JPG|thumb|A sundial made in 1812, by [[Whitehurst &amp; Son sundial (1812)|Whitehurst &amp; Son]] with a circular scale showing the equation of time correction. This is now on display in the Derby Museum.]]

From 1767 to 1833, the British ''[[Nautical Almanac|Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris]]'' tabulated the equation of time in the sense 'mean minus apparent solar time'.  Times in the Almanac were in apparent solar time, because time aboard ship was most often determined by observing the Sun. In the unusual case that the mean solar time of an observation was needed, one would apply the equation of time to ''apparent'' solar time. In the issues since 1834, all times have been in mean solar time, because by then the time aboard ship was increasingly often determined by [[marine chronometer]]s. In the unusual case that the apparent solar time of an observation was needed, one would apply the equation of time to ''mean'' solar time, requiring all differences in the equation of time to have the opposite sign than before.

As the apparent daily movement of the Sun is one revolution per day, that is 360° every 24&amp;nbsp;hours, and the Sun itself appears as a disc of about 0.5° in the sky, simple sundials can be read to a maximum accuracy of about one minute. Since the equation of time has a range of about 33&amp;nbsp;minutes, the difference between sundial time and clock time cannot be ignored. In addition to the equation of time, one also has to apply corrections due to one's distance from the local time zone meridian and [[Daylight saving time|summer time]], if any.

The tiny increase of the mean solar day due to the slowing down of the Earth's rotation, by about 2 [[Millisecond|ms]] per day per century, which currently accumulates up to about 1&amp;nbsp;second every year, is not taken into account in traditional definitions of the equation of time, as it is imperceptible at the accuracy level of sundials.

== Major components of the equation ==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2018}}
=== Eccentricity of the Earth's orbit ===
[[File:Zeitgleichung.png|thumb|250px|Equation of time (red solid line) and its two main components plotted separately, the part due to the obliquity of the ecliptic (mauve dashed line) and the part due to the Sun's varying apparent speed along the ecliptic due to eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (dark blue dash &amp; dot line)]]

The Earth revolves around the Sun. As seen from Earth, the Sun appears to revolve once around the Earth through the background stars in one year. If the Earth orbited the Sun with a constant speed, in a circular orbit in a plane perpendicular to the Earth's axis, then the Sun would [[culmination|culminate]] every day at exactly the same time, and be a perfect time keeper (except for the very small effect of the slowing rotation of the Earth). But the orbit of the Earth is an ellipse not centered on the Sun, and its speed varies between 30.287 and 29.291&amp;nbsp;km/s, according to [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], and its angular speed also varies, and thus the Sun appears to move faster (relative to the background stars) at [[perihelion]] (currently around 3&amp;nbsp;January) and slower at [[aphelion]] a half year later. &lt;ref name="eecen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eccentricity|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_fall2003.web.dir/Beth_Caissie/eccentricity.htm|website=ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Source cited does not discuss effect of eccentricity on equation of time|date=January 2018}}

At these extreme points this effect varies the apparent solar day by 7.9&amp;nbsp;s/day from its mean. Consequently, the smaller daily differences on other days in speed are cumulative until these points, reflecting how the planet accelerates and decelerates compared to the mean. As a result, the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit contributes a periodic variation which is (in the first-order approximation) a [[sine wave]] with an amplitude of 7.66&amp;nbsp;min and a [[periodic function|period]] of one year to the equation of time. The zero points are reached at perihelion (at the beginning of January) and aphelion (beginning of July); the extreme values are in early April (negative) and early October (positive).

=== Obliquity of the ecliptic ===
[[Image:Middaysun.gif|thumb|300px|right|Sun and planets at local apparent noon (Ecliptic in red, Sun and Mercury in yellow, Venus in white, Mars in red, Jupiter in yellow with red spot, Saturn in white with rings).]] 

However, even if the Earth's orbit were circular, the perceived motion of the Sun along our [[celestial equator]] would still not be uniform. This is a consequence of the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis with respect to the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of its orbit]], or equivalently, the tilt of the [[ecliptic]] (the path Sun appears to take in the [[celestial sphere]]) with respect to the [[celestial equator]]. The projection of this motion onto our [[celestial equator]], along which "clock time" is measured, is a maximum at the [[solstice]]s, when the yearly movement of the Sun is parallel to the equator (causing amplification of perceived speed) and yields mainly a change in [[right ascension]]. It is a minimum at the [[equinox]]es, when the Sun's apparent motion is more sloped and yields more change in [[declination]], leaving less for the component in [[right ascension]], which is the only component that affects the duration of the solar day. A practical illustration of obliquity is that the daily shift of the shadow cast by the Sun in a sundial even on the equator is smaller close to the solstices and greater close to the equinoxes.  If this effect operated alone, then days would be up to 24&amp;nbsp;hours and 20.3&amp;nbsp;seconds long (measured solar noon to solar noon) near the solstices, and as much as 20.3&amp;nbsp;seconds shorter than 24&amp;nbsp;hours near the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obliquity|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/212_fall2003.web.dir/Beth_Caissie/obliquity.htm|website=ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=Source cited does not discuss effect of obliquity on equation of time|date=January 2018}}

In the figure on the right, we can see the monthly variation of the apparent slope of the plane of the ecliptic at solar midday as seen from Earth. This variation is due to the apparent [[precession]] of the rotating Earth through the year, as seen from the Sun at solar midday.

In terms of the equation of time, the inclination of the ecliptic results in the contribution of a sine wave variation with an amplitude of 9.87 minutes and a period of a half year to the equation of time. The zero points of this sine wave are reached at the equinoxes and solstices, while the extrema are at the beginning of February and August (negative) and the beginning of May and November (positive).

==Secular effects==
The two above mentioned factors have different wavelengths, amplitudes and phases, so their combined contribution is an irregular wave. At [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] 2000 these are the values (in minutes and seconds with [[Universal Time|UT]] dates):

:E.T. = apparent − mean. Positive means: Sun runs fast and culminates earlier, or the sundial is ahead of mean time. A slight yearly variation occurs due to presence of leap years, resetting itself every 4&amp;nbsp;years.

The exact shape of the equation of time curve and the associated [[analemma]] slowly change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; over the centuries, due to [[secular variation]]s in both eccentricity and obliquity. At this moment both are slowly decreasing, but they increase and decrease over a timescale of hundreds of thousands of years. If and when the Earth's orbital eccentricity (now about 0.0167 and slowly decreasing) reaches 0.047, the eccentricity effect may in some circumstances overshadow the obliquity effect, leaving the equation of time curve with only one maximum and minimum per year, as is the case on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/allison_02/ Telling Time on Mars]&lt;/ref&gt;

On shorter timescales (thousands of years) the shifts in the dates of equinox and perihelion will be more important. The former is caused by [[precession]], and shifts the equinox backwards compared to the stars. But it can be ignored in the current discussion as our [[Gregorian calendar]] is constructed in such a way as to keep the vernal equinox date at 21&amp;nbsp;March (at least at sufficient accuracy for our aim here). The shift of the perihelion is forwards, about 1.7&amp;nbsp;days every century. In 1246 the perihelion occurred on 22&amp;nbsp;December, the day of the solstice, so the two contributing waves had common zero points and the equation of time curve was symmetrical: in ''Astronomical Algorithms'' Meeus gives February and November extrema of 15&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;39&amp;nbsp;s and May and July ones of 4&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;58&amp;nbsp;s. Before then the February minimum was larger than the November maximum, and the May maximum larger than the July minimum. In fact, in years before −1900 (1901&amp;nbsp;BCE) the May maximum was larger than the November maximum. In the year −2000 (2001&amp;nbsp;BCE) the May maximum was +12&amp;nbsp;minutes and a couple seconds while the November maximum was just less than 10&amp;nbsp;minutes.  The secular change is evident when one compares a current graph of the equation of time (see below) with one from 2000&amp;nbsp;years ago, e.g., one constructed from the data of Ptolemy.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Graphical representation==
[[File:EquationofTimeandAnalemma.gif|thumb|612px|center|Animation showing equation of time and [[analemma]] path over one year.]]

==Practical use==
If the [[gnomon]] (the shadow-casting object) is not an edge but a point (e.g., a hole in a plate), the shadow (or spot of light) will trace out a curve during the course of a day. If the shadow is cast on a plane surface, this curve will be a [[conic section]] (usually a hyperbola), since the circle of the Sun's motion together with the gnomon point define a cone. At the spring and fall equinoxes, the cone degenerates into a plane and the hyperbola into a line. With a different hyperbola for each day, hour marks can be put on each hyperbola which include any necessary corrections. Unfortunately, each hyperbola corresponds to two different days, one in each half of the year, and these two days will require different corrections. A convenient compromise is to draw the line for the "mean time" and add a curve showing the exact position of the shadow points at noon during the course of the year. This curve will take the form of a figure eight and is known as an '''[[analemma]]'''. By comparing the analemma to the mean noon line, the amount of correction to be applied generally on that day can be determined.

The equation of time is used not only in connection with [[sundial]]s and similar devices, but also for many applications of [[solar energy]]. Machines such as [[solar tracker]]s and [[heliostat]]s have to move in ways that are influenced by the equation of time.

[[Civil time]] is the local mean time for a meridian that often passes near the center of the [[time zone]], and may possibly be further altered by [[daylight saving time]]. When the apparent solar time that corresponds to a given civil time is to be found, the difference in longitude between the site of interest and the time zone meridian, daylight saving time, and the equation of time must all be considered.&lt;ref&gt;"How to find the exact time of solar noon" n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculating the equation of time==
The equation of time is obtained from a published table, or a graph. For dates in the past such tables are produced from historical measurements, or by calculation; for future dates, of course, tables can only be calculated. In devices such as computer-controlled heliostats the computer is often programmed to calculate the equation of time. The calculation can be numerical or analytical. The former are based on numerical integration of the differential equations of motion, including all significant gravitational and relativistic effects. The results are accurate to better than 1 second and are the basis for modern almanac data. The latter are based on a solution that includes only the gravitational interaction between the Sun and Earth, simpler than but not as accurate as the former. Its accuracy can be improved by including small corrections.

The following discussion describes a reasonably accurate (agreeing with Almanac data to within 3&amp;nbsp;seconds over a wide range of years) algorithm for the equation of time that is well known to astronomers.&lt;ref name="Duffet-Smith p.&amp;nbsp;89"&gt;Duffet-Smith p.&amp;nbsp;89&lt;/ref&gt; It also shows how to obtain a simple approximate formula (accurate to within 1&amp;nbsp;minute over a large time interval), that can be easily evaluated with a calculator and provides the simple explanation of the phenomenon that was used previously in this article.

===Mathematical description===
The precise definition of the equation of time is&lt;ref&gt;Hughes et al., p.1529&lt;/ref&gt;
:EOT = GHA − GMHA
The quantities occurring in this equation are
* EOT, the time difference between [[apparent solar time]] and [[mean solar time]];
* GHA, the Greenwich [[hour angle|Hour Angle]] of the apparent (actual) Sun;
* GMHA = Universal Time − Offset, the Greenwich Mean Hour Angle of the mean (fictitious) Sun.

Here time and angle are quantities that are related by factors such as: 2{{pi}}&amp;nbsp;radians = 360° = 1&amp;nbsp;day = 24&amp;nbsp;hours. The difference, EOT, is measurable since GHA is an angle that can be measured and [[Universal Time]], UT, is a scale for the measurement of time. The offset by {{pi}} = 180° = 12&amp;nbsp;hours from UT is needed because UT is zero at mean midnight while GMHA&amp;nbsp;= 0 at mean noon.{{refn|1=Universal Time is discontinuous at mean midnight so another quantity day number {{math|''N''}}, an integer, is required in order to form the continuous quantity time {{math|''t''}}: {{nowrap|1={{math|''t''}} = {{math|''N''}} + {{sfrac|UT|24 hr}} days}}.|group= n}} Both GHA and GMHA, like all physical angles, have a mathematical, but not a physical discontinuity at their respective (apparent and mean) noon. Despite the mathematical discontinuities of its components, EOT is defined as a continuous function by adding (or subtracting) 24&amp;nbsp;hours in the small time interval between the discontinuities in GHA and GMHA.

According to the definitions of the angles on the celestial sphere {{nowrap|1=GHA = GAST − {{math|''α''}}}} (see [[hour angle]])&lt;br/&gt; where:
* GAST is the Greenwich apparent [[sidereal time]] (the angle between the apparent [[vernal equinox]] and the meridian in the plane of the equator).  This is a known function of UT.&lt;ref&gt;"Computing Greenwich Sidereal Time", Naval Oceanography Portal&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{math|''α''}} is the [[right ascension]] of the apparent Sun (the angle between the apparent vernal equinox and the actual Sun in the plane of the equator).

On substituting into the equation of time, it is
:EOT = GAST − {{math|''α''}} − UT + offset
Like the formula for GHA above, one can write {{nowrap|1=GMHA = GAST − {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, where the last term is the right ascension of the mean Sun. The equation is often written in these terms as&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron p.&amp;nbsp;275, Roy p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt;
:EOT = {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; − ''α''}}
where {{nowrap|1={{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}} = GAST − UT + offset}}. In this formulation a measurement or calculation of EOT at a certain value of time depends on a measurement or calculation of {{math|''α''}} at that time. Both {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}} vary from 0 to 24 hours during the course of a year. The former has a discontinuity at a time that depends on the value of UT, while the later has its at a slightly later time. As a consequence, when calculated this way EOT has two, artificial, discontinuities. They can both be removed by subtracting 24 hours from the value of EOT in the small time interval after the discontinuity in {{math|''α''}} and before the one in {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The resulting EOT is a continuous function of time.

Another definition, denoted {{math|''E''}} to distinguish it from EOT, is
:{{math|''E''}} = GMST − {{math|''α''}} − UT + offset
Here {{nowrap|1=GMST = GAST − eqeq}}, is the Greenwich mean sidereal time (the angle between the mean vernal equinox and the mean Sun in the plane of the equator). Therefore, GMST is an approximation to GAST (and {{math|''E''}} is an approximation to EOT); eqeq is called the equation of the equinoxes and is due to the wobbling, or [[astronomical nutation|nutation]] of the Earth's axis of rotation about its precessional motion. Since the amplitude of the nutational motion is only about 1.2&amp;nbsp;s (18″ of longitude) the difference between EOT and {{math|''E''}} can be ignored unless one is interested in subsecond accuracy.

A third definition, denoted {{math|Δ''t''}} to distinguish it from EOT and {{math|''E''}}, and now called the Equation of Ephemeris Time&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, et. al., p.&amp;nbsp;1532&lt;/ref&gt; (prior to the distinction that is now made between EOT, {{math|''E''}}, and {{math|Δ''t''}} the latter was known as the equation of time) is
:{{math|1=Δ''t'' = ''Λ'' − ''α''}}
here {{math|''Λ''}} is the [[ecliptic longitude]] of the mean Sun (the angle from the mean vernal equinox to the mean Sun in the plane of the [[ecliptic]]).

The difference {{nowrap|{{math|''Λ''}} − (GMST − UT + offset)}} is 1.3&amp;nbsp;s from 1960 to 2040. Therefore, over this restricted range of years {{math|Δ''t''}} is an approximation to EOT whose error is in the range 0.1 to 2.5&amp;nbsp;s depending on the longitude correction in the equation of the equinoxes; for many purposes, for example correcting a sundial, this accuracy is more than good enough.

===Right ascension calculation===
The right ascension, and hence the equation of time, can be calculated from Newton's two-body theory of celestial motion, in which the bodies (Earth and Sun) describe elliptical orbits about their common mass center. Using this theory, the equation of time becomes
:{{math|1=Δ''t'' = ''M'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; − ''α''}}
where the new angles that appear are
*{{math|1=''M'' = {{sfrac|2π(''t'' − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)|''t''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, is the [[mean anomaly]], the angle from the [[periapsis]] of the elliptical orbit to the mean Sun; its range is from 0 to 2{{pi}} as {{math|''t''}} increases from {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + ''t''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;}};
* {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|365.2596358}}&amp;nbsp;days is the length of time in an [[anomalistic year]]: the time interval between two successive passages of the periapsis;
* {{math|1=''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = ''Λ'' − ''M''}}, is the ecliptic longitude of the periapsis;
* {{math|''t''}} is [[dynamical time]], the independent variable in the theory. Here it is taken to be identical with the continuous time based on UT (see above), but in more precise calculations (of {{math|''E''}} or EOT) the small difference between them must be accounted for&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, et. al., p.&amp;nbsp;1530, "Computing Greenwich Sidereal Time", Naval Oceanography Portal&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the distinction between UT1 and UTC.

To complete the calculation three additional angles are required:
* {{math|''E''}}, the Sun's [[eccentric anomaly]] (note that this is different from {{math|''M''}});
* {{math|''ν''}}, the Sun's [[true anomaly]];
* {{math|1=''λ'' = ''ν'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the Sun's true longitude on the ecliptic.

[[File:EquationOfTimeGeom.svg|thumb|500px|right|The celestial sphere and the Sun's elliptical orbit as seen by a geocentric observer looking normal to the ecliptic showing the 6 angles ({{math|''M'', ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, ''α'', ''ν'', ''λ'', ''E''}}) needed for the calculation of the equation of time. For the sake of clarity the drawings are not to scale.]]

All these angles are shown in the figure on the right, which shows the [[celestial sphere]] and the  Sun's [[elliptical orbit]] seen from the Earth (the same as the Earth's orbit seen from the Sun). In this figure {{math|''ε''}} is the [[obliquity]], while {{math|1=''e'' = {{sqrt|1 − (''b''/''a'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} is the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the ellipse.

Now given a value of {{math|0 ≤ ''M'' ≤ 2π}}, one can calculate {{math|''α''(''M'')}} by means of the following well-known procedure:&lt;ref name="Duffet-Smith p.&amp;nbsp;89"/&gt;

First, given {{math|''M''}}, calculate {{math|''E''}} from [[Kepler's equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Moulton p.&amp;nbsp;159&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=''M'' = ''E'' − ''e'' sin ''E''}}

Although this equation cannot be solved exactly in closed form, values of {{math|''E''(''M'')}} can be obtained from infinite (power or trigonometric) series, graphical, or numerical methods. Alternatively, note that for {{math|1=''e'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''E'' = ''M''}}, and by iteration:&lt;ref&gt;Hinch p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|''E'' ≈ ''M'' + ''e'' sin ''M''}}.
This approximation can be improved, for small {{math|''e''}}, by iterating again,
:{{math|''E'' ≈ ''M'' + ''e'' sin ''M'' + {{sfrac|1|2}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin 2''M''}},
and continued iteration produces successively higher order terms of the power series expansion in {{math|''e''}}. For small values of {{math|''e''}} (much less than 1) two or three terms of the series give a good approximation for {{math|''E''}}; the smaller {{math|''e''}}, the better the approximation.

Next, knowing {{math|''E''}}, calculate the [[true anomaly]] {{math|''ν''}} from an elliptical orbit relation&lt;ref&gt;Moulton p.&amp;nbsp;165&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nu=2\tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{1+e}{1-e}}\tan\tfrac12 E \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The correct branch of the multiple valued function {{math|tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''}} to use is the one that makes {{math|''ν''}} a continuous function of {{math|''E''(''M'')}} starting from {{math|1=''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''E''=0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}. Thus for {{math|0 ≤ ''E'' &lt; π}} use {{math|1=tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x'' = Tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''}}, and for {{math|π &lt; ''E'' ≤ 2π}} use {{math|1=tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x'' = Tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x'' + π}}. At the specific value {{math|1=''E'' = π}} for which the argument of {{math|tan}} is infinite, use {{math|1=''ν'' = ''E''}}. Here {{math|Tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''}} is the principal branch, {{math|1={{abs|Tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''}} &lt; {{sfrac|π|2}}}}; the function that is returned by calculators and computer applications.  Alternatively, this function can be expressed in terms of its [[Taylor series]] in {{math|''e''}}, the first three terms of which are:
:{{math|''ν'' ≈ ''E'' + ''e'' sin ''E'' + {{sfrac|1|4}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin 2''E''}}.
For small {{math|''e''}} this approximation (or even just the first two terms) is a good one. Combining the approximation for {{math|''E''(''M'')}} with this one for {{math|''ν''(''E'')}} produces
:{{math|''ν'' ≈ ''M'' + 2''e'' sin ''M'' + {{sfrac|5|4}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin 2''M''}}.
The relation {{math|''ν''(''M'')}} is called the [[equation of the center]]; the expression written here is a second-order approximation in {{math|''e''}}. For the small value of {{math|''e''}} that characterises the Earth's orbit this gives a very good approximation for {{math|''ν''(''M'')}}.

Next, knowing {{math|''ν''}}, calculate {{math|''λ''}} from its definition:
:{{math|1=''λ'' = ''ν'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}
The value of {{math|''λ''}} varies non-linearly with {{math|''M''}} because the orbit is elliptical and not circular. From the approximation for {{math|''ν''}}:
:{{math|''λ'' ≈ ''M'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''e'' sin ''M'' + {{sfrac|5|4}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin 2''M''}}.

Finally, knowing {{math|''λ''}} calculate {{math|''α''}} from a relation for the right triangle on the celestial sphere shown above&lt;ref&gt;Burington p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=''α'' = tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(cos ''ε'' tan ''λ'')}}
Note that the quadrant of {{math|''α''}} is the same as that of {{math|''λ''}}, therefore reduce {{math|''λ''}} to the range 0 to 2{{pi}} and write
:{{math|1=''α'' = Tan&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (cos {{math|''ε''}} tan {{math|''λ''}}) + ''k''π}},
where {{math|''k''}} is 0 if {{math|''λ''}} is in quadrant 1, it is 1 if {{math|''λ''}} is in quadrants 2 or 3 and it is 2 if {{math|''λ''}} is in quadrant 4. For the values at which tan is infinite, {{math|1=''α'' = ''λ''}}.

Although approximate values for {{math|''α''}} can be obtained from truncated Taylor series like those for {{math|''ν''}},&lt;ref&gt;Whitman p.&amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; it is more efficacious to use the equation&lt;ref&gt;Milne p.&amp;nbsp;374&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=''α'' = ''λ'' − sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [''y'' sin (''α'' + ''λ'')]}}
where {{math|1=''y'' = tan&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;{{sfrac|''ε''|2}}&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;}}. Note that for {{math|1=''ε'' = ''y'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''α'' = ''λ''}} and iterating twice:
:{{math|''α'' ≈ ''λ'' − ''y'' sin 2''λ'' + {{sfrac|1|2}}''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin 4''λ''}}.

===Equation of time===
The equation of time is obtained by substituting the result of the right ascension calculation into an equation of time formula. Here {{math|1=Δ''t''(''M'') = ''M'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; − ''α''[''λ''(''M'')]}} is used; in part because small corrections (of the order of 1 second), that would justify using {{math|''E''}}, are not included, and in part because the goal is to obtain a simple analytical expression. Using two term approximations for {{math|''λ''(''M'')}} and {{math|''α''(''λ'')}}, allows {{math|Δ''t''}} to be written as an explicit expression of two terms, which is designated {{math|Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''ey''&lt;/sub&gt;}} because it is a first order approximation in {{math|''e''}} and in {{math|''y''}}.
:{{math|1=Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''ey''&lt;/sub&gt; = −2''e'' sin ''M'' + y sin (2''M'' + 2''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) = −7.659 sin ''M'' + 9.863 sin (2''M'' + 3.5932)}}&amp;nbsp;minutes
This equation was first derived by Milne,&lt;ref&gt;Milne p.&amp;nbsp;375&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote it in terms of {{math|1=''λ'' = ''M'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The numerical values written here result from using the orbital parameter values, {{math|''e''}} = {{val|0.016709}}, {{math|''ε''}} = {{val|23.4393}}° = {{val|0.409093}}&amp;nbsp;radians, and {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|282.9381}}° = {{val|4.938201}}&amp;nbsp;radians that correspond to the epoch 1&amp;nbsp;January 2000 at 12 noon [[UT1]]. When evaluating the numerical expression for {{math|Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''ey''&lt;/sub&gt;}} as given above, a calculator must be in radian mode to obtain correct values because the value of {{math|2''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; − 2π}} in the argument of the second term is written there in radians. Higher order approximations can also be written,&lt;ref&gt;Muller Eqs (45) and (46)&lt;/ref&gt; but they necessarily have more terms. For example, the second order approximation in both {{math|''e''}} and {{math|''y''}} consists of five terms&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, et. al., p1535&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{math|1=Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''ey''&lt;/sub&gt; − {{sfrac|5|4}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin 2''M'' + ''ey'' sin ''M'' cos (2''M'' + 2''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) − {{sfrac|1|2}}''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sin (4''M'' + 4''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)}}
This approximation has the potential for high accuracy, however, in order to achieve it over a wide range of years, the parameters {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''ε''}}, and {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} must be allowed to vary with time.&lt;ref&gt;Duffett-Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;86, Hughes, et. al., p.&amp;nbsp;1531,1535&lt;/ref&gt; This creates additional calculational complications. Other approximations have been proposed, for example, {{math|Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Duffett-Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;86, Williams&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the first order equation of the center but no other approximation to determine {{math|''α''}}, and {{math|Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;"Approximate Solar Coordinates", Naval Oceanographic Portal&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the second order equation of the center.

The time variable, {{math|''M''}}, can be written either in terms of {{math|''n''}}, the number of days past perihelion, or {{math|''D''}}, the number of days past a specific date and time (epoch):
:{{math|1=''M'' = {{sfrac|2π|''t''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;}}''n'' days = ''M&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' + {{sfrac|2π|''t''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;}}''D'' days = {{val|6.24004077}} + {{val|0.01720197}}''D''}}
Here {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the value of {{math|''M''}} at the chosen date and time. For the values given here, in radians, {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is that measured for the actual Sun at the epoch, 1&amp;nbsp;January 2000 at 12&amp;nbsp;noon UT1, and {{math|''D''}} is the number of days past that epoch. At periapsis {{math|1=''M'' = 2π}}, so solving gives {{math|1=''D'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|2.508109}}. This puts the periapsis on 4&amp;nbsp;January 2000 at 00:11:41 while the actual periapsis is, according to results from the ''Multiyear Interactive Computer Almanac''&lt;ref&gt;U.S.Naval Observatory&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated as MICA), on 3&amp;nbsp;January 2000 at 05:17:30. This large discrepancy happens because the difference between the orbital radius at the two locations is only 1 part in a million; in other words, radius is a very weak function of time near periapsis. As a practical matter this means that one cannot get a highly accurate result for the equation of time by using {{math|''n''}} and adding the actual periapsis date for a given year. However, high accuracy can be achieved by using the formulation in terms of {{math|''D''}}.
[[File:EquationOfTime612.png|thumb|500px|right|Curves of {{math|Δ''t''}} and {{math|Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''ey''&lt;/sub&gt;}} along with symbols locating the daily values at noon (at 10-day intervals) obtained from the ''Multiyear Interactive Computer Almanac'' vs {{math|''d''}} for the year 2000.]]
When {{math|''D'' &gt; ''D''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ''M'' is greater than 2{{pi}} and one must subtract a multiple of 2{{pi}} (that depends on the year) from it to bring it into the range 0 to 2{{pi}}. Likewise for years prior to 2000 one must add multiples of 2{{pi}}. For example, for the year 2010, {{math|''D''}} varies from {{val|3653}} on 1&amp;nbsp;January at noon to {{val|4017}} on 31&amp;nbsp;December at noon, the corresponding {{math|''M''}} values are {{val|69.0789468}} and {{val|75.3404748}} and are reduced to the range 0 to 2{{pi}} by subtracting 10 and 11 times 2{{pi}} respectively. One can always write {{math|1=''D'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt; + ''d''}}, where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of days from the epoch to noon on 1&amp;nbsp;January of the desired year, and {{math|0 ≤ ''d'' ≤ 364}} (365 if the calculation is for a leap year).

The result of the computations is usually given as either a set of tabular values, or a graph of the equation of time as a function of {{math|''d''}}.  A comparison of plots of {{math|Δ''t''}}, {{math|Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''ey''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and results from MICA all for the year 2000 is shown in the figure on the right. The plot of {{math|Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''ey''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is seen to be close to the results produced by MICA, the absolute error, {{nowrap|1=Err = {{abs|{{math|Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''ey''&lt;/sub&gt;}} − MICA2000}}}}, is less than 1&amp;nbsp;minute throughout the year; its largest value is 43.2&amp;nbsp;seconds and occurs on day&amp;nbsp;276 (3&amp;nbsp;October). The plot of {{math|Δ''t''}} is indistinguishable from the results of MICA, the largest absolute error between the two is 2.46&amp;nbsp;s on day&amp;nbsp;324 (20&amp;nbsp;November).

====Remark on the continuity of the equation of time====
For the choice of the appropriate branch of the {{math|arctan}} relation with respect to function continuity a modified version of the arctangent function is helpful. It brings in previous knowledge about the expected value by a parameter. The modified arctangent function is defined as:
:{{math|1=arctan&lt;sub&gt;''η''&lt;/sub&gt; ''x'' = arctan ''x'' + π round ({{sfrac|''η'' − arctan ''x''|π}})}}.
It produces a value that is as close to {{math|''η''}} as possible. The function {{math|round}} rounds to the nearest integer.

Applying this yields:
:{{math|1=Δ''t''(''M'') = ''M'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; − arctan&lt;sub&gt;(''M''+''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; (cos ''ε'' tan ''λ'')}}.
The parameter {{math|''M'' + ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} arranges here to set {{math|Δ''t''}} to the zero nearest value which is the desired one.

===Secular effects===
The difference between the MICA and {{math|Δ''t''}} results was checked every 5&amp;nbsp;years over the range from 1960 to 2040. In every instance the maximum absolute error was less than 3&amp;nbsp;s; the largest difference, 2.91&amp;nbsp;s, occurred on 22&amp;nbsp;May 1965 (day&amp;nbsp;141). However, in order to achieve this level of accuracy over this range of years it is necessary to account for the secular change in the orbital parameters with time. The equations that describe this variation are:&lt;ref&gt;Duffett-Smith p.&amp;nbsp;86, Hughes, et. al., p.&amp;nbsp;1531,1535&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e &amp;= 1.6709 \times 10^{-2} - 4.193 \times 10^{-5}\left(\frac{D}{36\,525}\right) - 1.26\times 10^{-7}\left(\frac{D}{36525}\right)^2 \\
\varepsilon &amp;= 23.4393-0.013\left(\frac{D}{36\,525}\right) - 2\times 10^{-7}\left(\frac{D}{36\,525}\right)^2 + 5\times 10^{-7}\left(\frac{D}{36\,525}\right)^3\mbox{ degrees} \\
\lambda_\mathrm{p} &amp;= 282.938\,07 + 1.7195\left(\frac{D}{36\,525}\right) + 3.025\times 10^{-4}\left(\frac{D}{36\,525}\right)^2\mbox{ degrees}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
According to these relations, in 100&amp;nbsp;years ({{math|''D''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|36525}}), {{math|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} increases by about 0.5% (1.7°), {{math|''e''}} decreases by about 0.25%, and {{math|''ε''}} decreases by about 0.05%.

As a result, the number of calculations required for any of the higher-order approximations of the equation of time requires a computer to complete them, if one wants to achieve their inherent accuracy over a wide range of time. In this event it is no more difficult to evaluate {{math|Δ''t''}} using a computer than any of its approximations.

In all this note that {{math|Δ''t&lt;sub&gt;ey&lt;/sub&gt;''}} as written above is easy to evaluate, even with a calculator, is accurate enough (better than 1&amp;nbsp;minute over the 80-year range) for correcting sundials, and has the nice physical explanation as the sum of two terms, one due to obliquity and the other to eccentricity that was used previously in the article. This is not true either for {{math|Δ''t''}} considered as a function of {{math|''M''}} or for any of its higher-order approximations.

===Alternative calculation===
Another calculation of the equation of time can be done as follows.&lt;ref&gt;Williams&lt;/ref&gt; Angles are in degrees; the conventional [[order of operations]] applies.

:{{math|''W''}} = {{sfrac|360°|365.24 days}}
{{math|''W''}} is the Earth's mean angular orbital velocity in degrees per day.

:{{math|1=''A'' = ''W'' × (''D'' + 10)}}
{{math|''D''}} is the date, in days starting at zero on 1&amp;nbsp;January (i.e. the days part of the [[ordinal date]] minus&amp;nbsp;1). 10 is the approximate number of days from the December solstice to 1&amp;nbsp;January. {{math|''A''}} is the angle the earth would move on its orbit at its average speed from the December solstice to date {{math|''D''}}.

:{{math|1=''B'' = ''A'' + {{sfrac|360°|π}} × 0.0167 × sin [''W''(''D'' − 2)]}}
{{math|''B''}} is the angle the Earth moves from the solstice to date {{math|''D''}}, including a first-order correction for the Earth's orbital eccentricity, 0.0167. The number 2 is the number of days from 1&amp;nbsp;January to the date of the Earth's [[perihelion]]. This expression for {{math|''B''}} can be simplified by combining constants to: 
:{{math|1=''B'' = ''A'' + 1.914° × sin [''W''(''D'' − 2)]}}.

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{A-\arctan\frac{\tan B}{\cos 23.44^\circ}}{180^\circ}&lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''C''}} is the difference between the angles moved at mean speed, and at the corrected speed projected onto the equatorial plane, and divided by 180 to get the difference in "[[Turn (geometry)|half turns]]". The value 23.44° is the obliquity (tilt) of the Earth's axis. The subtraction gives the conventional sign to the equation of time. For any given value of {{math|''x''}}, {{math|[[Inverse trigonometric functions#arctan|arctan]] ''x''}} (sometimes written as {{math|tan{{sup|−1}} ''x''}}) has multiple values, differing from each other by integer numbers of half turns. The value generated by a calculator or computer may not be the appropriate one for this calculation. This may cause {{math|''C''}} to be wrong by an integer number of half turns. The excess half turns are removed in the next step of the calculation to give the equation of time:

:EOT = 720 × {{math|(''C'' − nint(''C''))}}&amp;nbsp;minutes

The expression [[Nearest integer function|{{math|nint(''C'')}}]] means the nearest integer to {{math|''C''}}. On a computer, it can be programmed, for example, as {{nowrap|&lt;tt&gt;INT(C + 0.5)&lt;/tt&gt;}}. It is 0, 1, or 2 at different times of the year. Subtracting it leaves a small positive or negative fractional number of half turns, which is multiplied by 720, the number of minutes (12&amp;nbsp;hours) that the Earth takes to rotate one half turn relative to the Sun, to get the equation of time.

Compared with published values,&lt;ref name="Waugh, p.&amp;nbsp;205"/&gt; this calculation has a [[root mean square]] error of only 3.7&amp;nbsp;s. The greatest error is 6.0&amp;nbsp;s. This is much more accurate than the approximation described above, but not as accurate as the elaborate calculation.

====Addendum about solar declination====
{{Main article|Declination|Position of the Sun}}
The value of {{math|''B''}} in the above calculation is an accurate value for the Sun's ecliptic longitude (shifted by 90°), so the solar declination becomes readily available:

:Declination = {{math|−arcsin (sin 23.44° × cos ''B'')}}

which is accurate to within a fraction of a degree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">In [[geomorphology]] '''fluvio-thermal erosion''' is the combined mechanical and [[thermal erosion]] of an unfrozen river or stream against ice-rich soils and [[sediment]]s. The [[Erosion|erosional process]] includes the thawing of ice sediments by a strong water flow and once the surface is unfrozen, mechanical erosion occurs only if [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] forces are powerful enough to incise the riverbank material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.722/full|title=Effects of Ice Content on the Thermal Erosion of Permafrost: Implications for Coastal and Fluvial Erosion|last=Dupeyrat|first=L|date=2011|website=Wiley Online Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of erosion sometimes causes the [[River bank failure|banks to collapse]] into the river, and when this occurs collapses are commonly controlled by [[ice wedge]]s.&lt;ref name=French2007&gt;{{cite book|first=Hugh M.|last=French|title=The Periglacial Environment|edition=3rd|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.|isbn=978-0-470-86588-0|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers where this process has been observed include the [[Lena River|Lena]],  the [[Colville River (Alaska)|Colville River]] delta, and the [[Yukon River]].&lt;ref name=French2007/&gt;

The [[Yakutia|Yakutia region]] in Central [[Siberia]], where the Lena River is located, is an exceptional point of interest to study this type of erosion based on its record low temperatures and extreme thickness of [[permafrost]]. During the winter when water level is low, a thick sheet of ice forms on top of the Lena River, that is sometimes as much as 2m thick.  Seasonal floods caused by rapid snowmelt and irregular storms then break the ice apart in the summer, exposing the banks of the river to the power of erosion. There are two stages to this process: the first is the breakup of the ice and the second is the [[flood]]ing. Over the course of just a few days in May or June, water discharge can increase by 10x its velocity. The force of the water causes the ice sitting on top of the river to break apart, and these broken pieces are thrust up onto the riverbanks, sometimes forming an ice barrier that as high as 10m tall that will protect the banks from erosion for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp.1812/abstract|title=An Assessment of the Erosion Potential of the Fluvial Thermal Process during Ice Breakups of the Lena River (Siberia)|last=Costard|first=Francois|date=2014|website=Wiley Online Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the flood continues, the warmth and mechanical energy from the water melts the ice barrier, giving way for the fluvio-thermal erosion of the frozen riverbanks. For the Lena, the banks are observed to retreat approximately 40m per year.

Based on lab models carried out in a cold room, high water temperature, ice temperature, and discharge are shown to be the main contributors of thermal erosion, whereas high ice content in the soil is shown to slow down the thermal erosion process. Melting of the ice within a [[Porous medium|porous material]] reduces the strength of the material, rendering it easily breakable and removable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.1489/abstract|title=Fluvial thermal erosion: heat balance integral method|last=Randriamazaoro|first=R|date=2007|website=Wiley Online Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the melting period of a periglacial river in the summer, due to a relatively high water discharge, the unfrozen sediments are [[Weathering|weathered]] away. In conclusion, water discharge in permanent contact with permafrost banks creates a combination of thermal and mechanical erosion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4397">A '''generalist species''' is able to thrive in a wide variety of environmental conditions and can make use of a variety of different [[natural resource|resources]] (for example, a [[heterotroph]] with a varied [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]). A '''specialist species''' can thrive only in a narrow range of environmental conditions or has a limited diet. Most [[organism]]s do not all fit neatly into either group, however. Some species are highly specialized (the most extreme case being '''[[List of feeding behaviours#By food type|monophagy]]'''), others less so, and some can tolerate many different environments. In other words, there is a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] from highly-specialized to broadly-generalist species.

[[File:Waschbaer auf dem Dach.jpg|left|thumb|Generalists such as [[raccoon]]s are sometimes able to adapt to [[urban environment]]s.]]

[[Omnivore]]s are usually generalists. [[Herbivore]]s are often specialists, but those that eat a variety of plants may be considered generalists. A well-known example of a specialist animal is the [[koala]], which subsists almost entirely on [[eucalyptus]] leaves. The [[raccoon]] is a generalist because it has a natural range that includes most of North and Central America, and it is omnivorous, eating [[berries]], [[insect]]s, butterflies      ([[Asterocampa celtis|Hackberry Emperor]], for example), [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and small [[animal]]s. Monophagous organisms feed exclusively, or nearly so, on a single other species.

The distinction between generalists and specialists is not limited to animals. For example, some plants require a narrow range of temperatures, [[soil]] conditions and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] to survive while others can tolerate a broader range of conditions. A [[cactus]] could be considered a specialist species. It will die during winters at high [[latitude]]s or if it receives too much water.

When [[body weight]] is controlled for, specialist feeders such as [[insectivore]]s and [[frugivore]]s have larger [[home range]]s than generalists like some [[folivore]]s (leaf eaters). Because their food source is less abundant, they need a bigger area for [[foraging]].&lt;ref name="Krebs93"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Krebs | first = J. R. | last2 = Davies | first2 = N. B. | title =  An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell  | year = 1993 | page35 = | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CA31asx7zq4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=behavioral+ecology+an+introduction&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-632-03546-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example comes from the research of [[Tim Clutton-Brock]], who found that the [[black and white colobus]], a folivore generalist, needs a home range of only 15[[hectare|ha]]. On the other hand, the more specialized [[red colobus monkey]] has a home range of 70 ha, which it requires to find patchy shoots, flowers and fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Clutton-Brock|first1=T.H.|year=1975 |title=Feeding behaviour of red colobus and black and white colobus in East Africa |journal=Folia Primatologica |volume=23 |issue= 3|pages=165–207 |url= |doi=10.1159/000155671 |pmid=805763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When environmental conditions change, generalists are able to adapt, but specialists tend to fall victim to [[extinction]] much more easily.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, C.; Begon, M.; Harper, J. (2003) ''Essentials of Ecology'' (2nd edition) p.54-55 Blackwell, {{ISBN|1-4051-0328-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a species of fish were to go extinct, any specialist [[parasite]]s would [[coextinction|also face extinction]]. On the other hand, a species with a highly specialized [[ecological niche]] is more effective at [[competition (biology)|competing]] with other organisms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} For example, a fish and its [[parasite]]s are in an [[evolutionary arms race]], a form of [[co-evolution]], in which the fish constantly develops defenses against the parasite, while the parasite in turn evolves adaptations to cope with the specific defenses of its host. This tends to drive the [[speciation]] of more specialized species provided conditions remain relatively stable. This involves [[niche partitioning]] as new species are formed, and [[biodiversity]] is increased.

The '''Jigawa ethanol program''' is a program to produce [[ethanol]] from agricultural products in [[Jigawa]], [[Nigeria]]. The ethanol programme was initiated by the [[President of Nigeria|Nigerian President]], [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], to process [[sugarcane]] into [[biofuel]]. Besides sugarcane, the Nigerian Government plans to start processing [[cassava]] as well.

{{Greek myth (Hades)}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Lethe''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|θ|i}} ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Λήθη}}, ''Lḗthē''; {{IPA-el|lɛ́:tʰɛː|anc}}, {{IPA-el|ˈliθi|mod}}) was one of the five rivers of the underworld of [[Hades]].  Also known as the ''Ameles potamos'' (river of unmindfulness), the Lethe flowed around the cave of [[Hypnos]] and through the Underworld, where all those who drank from it experienced complete forgetfulness.  Lethe was also the name of the Greek spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion, with whom the river was often identified.

In Classical Greek, the word [[wikt:Lethe|lethe]] ([[wikt:λήθη#Ancient Greek|λήθη]]) literally means "oblivion", "forgetfulness", or "concealment".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|lh/qh|λήθη|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is related to the Greek word for "truth", ''[[aletheia]]'' ([[wikt:ἀλήθεια|ἀλήθεια]]), which through the [[privative alpha]] literally means "un-forgetfulness" or "un-concealment".

==Mythology==

===River===
Lethe, the river of forgetfulness, was one of the five rivers of the [[Greek underworld]], the other four being [[Styx]], [[Acheron]] (the river of sorrow), [[Cocytus]] (the river of lamentation) and [[Phlegethon]] (the river of fire).  According to [[Statius]], it bordered [[Elysium]], the final resting place of the virtuous. [[Ovid]] wrote that the river flowed through the cave of Hypnos, god of sleep, where its murmuring would induce drowsiness.&lt;ref name="Theoi"&gt;{{Cite web
| title = LETHE : Greek goddess of the underworld river of oblivion ; mythology| url = http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/PotamosLethe.html | accessdate = 2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shades of the dead were required to drink the waters of the Lethe in order to forget their earthly life.  In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Virgil]] (VI.703-751) writes that it is only when the dead have had their memories erased by the Lethe that they may be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]].&lt;ref name="Virgil"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Day-Lewis | first = Cecil (trans.)  | title =Virgil's [[Aeneid]]  | year = 1952 | pages = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goddess===
Lethe was also the name of the personification of forgetfulness and oblivion, with whom the river was often associated. [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' identifies her as the daughter of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] ("strife"), and the sister of [[Ponos]] ("Hardship"), [[Limos (mythology)|Limos]] ("Starvation"), [[Algos|Algea]] ("Pains"), [[Hysminai]] ("Battles"), [[Makhai]] ("Wars"), [[Phonoi]] ("Murders"), [[Androctasiai|Androktasiai]] ("Manslaughters"), [[Neikea]] ("Quarrels"), Pseudea ("Lies"), Logoi ("Stories"), [[Amphillogiai]] ("Disputes"), [[Dysnomia (mythology)|Dysnomia]] ("Anarchy"), [[Atë|Ate]] ("Ruin"), and [[Horkos]] ("Oath").&lt;ref&gt;Richard Caldwell, ''Hesiod's Theogony'', Focus Publishing/R. Pullins Company (June 1, 1987). {{ISBN|978-0-941051-00-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in religion and philosophy==
Some ancient Greeks believed that souls were made to drink from the river before being reincarnated, so they would not remember their past lives.  The [[Myth of Er]] in Book X of [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' tells of the dead arriving at a barren waste called the "plain of Lethe", through which the river ''Ameles'' ("careless") runs. "Of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity," Plato wrote, "and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he drank forgot all things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Republic by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s taught the existence of another river, the [[Mnemosyne]]; those who drank from the Mnemosyne would remember everything and attain [[omniscience]]. Initiates were taught that they would receive a choice of rivers to drink from after death, and to drink from Mnemosyne instead of Lethe.

These two rivers are attested in several verse inscriptions on gold plates dating to the 4th century BC and onward, found at [[Thurii]] in Southern [[Italy]] and elsewhere throughout the Greek world. There were rivers of Lethe and Mnemosyne at the oracular shrine of [[Trophonius]] in [[Boeotia]], from which worshippers would drink before making oracular consultations with the god.

More recently, [[Martin Heidegger]] used "lēthē" to symbolize the "concealment of Being" or "forgetting of Being" that he saw as a major problem of modern philosophy. Examples are found in his books on [[Nietzsche]] (Vol 1, p.&amp;nbsp;194) and on Parmenides.

== References in literature ==
{{main|River Lethe in popular culture}}
Many ancient Greek poems mention or describe Lethe. The river is also referenced in more recent novels and poetry. [[Simonides of Ceos]], an ancient Greek lyrical poet, references Lethe in the sixty-seventh fragment of one of his poems. [[Ovid|Publius Ovidius Naso]], known as Ovid, in his description of the Underworld in his ''[[Metamorphoses]],'' includes a description of Lethe as a stream that puts people to sleep. [[Aeneas]], the protagonist of [[Virgil|Virgil's]] epic Latin poem, ''[[Aeneid]]'', travels to Lethe to meet the ghost of his father in Book VI of the poem.

''"The souls that throng the flood ''

''Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow'd:''

''In Lethe's lake they long oblivion taste,''

''Of future life secure, forgetful of the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.6.vi.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Aeneid by Virgil|website=classics.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Virgil also writes about Lethe in his didactic hexameter poem, the ''[[Georgics]]''.

In the ''[[Purgatorio]]'', the second ''cantica'' of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', the Lethe is located in the [[Purgatorio#The Earthly Paradise|Earthly Paradise]] atop the Mountain of Purgatory. Dante, held in the arms of Matilda, is immersed in the Lethe so that he may wipe out all memory of sin (''Purg''. XXXI). After being washed in the Lethe, penitents are washed in the [[Eunoe]], a river of Dante's own invention. The Lethe is also mentioned in the ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', the first part of the ''Comedy'', as flowing down to Hell from Purgatory to be frozen in the ice around Satan, "the last lost vestiges of the sins of the saved"&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ciardi]], ''Purgatorio'', notes on Canto XXVII, pg. 535&lt;/ref&gt; (''Inf.'' XXXIV.130).

In his first speech in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', Satan describes how "The associates and copartners of our loss, Lie thus astonished on ''the oblivious pool''", referencing Lethe.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', Kastan Ed., Book 1, lines 265-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real rivers==
[[Image:Rio Lima 2.JPG|thumb|right|Lima Bridge on Lima River in [[Ponte de Lima]], [[Portugal]]]]

Amongst authors in Antiquity, the tiny [[Lima river]] between [[Norte Region, Portugal]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia, Spain]] was said to have the same properties of memory loss as the legendary Lethe River, being mistaken for it. In 138 BCE, the Roman general [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]] sought to dispose of the myth, as it impeded his military campaigns in the area. He was said to have crossed the Lima and then called his soldiers from the other side, one by one, by name. The soldiers, astonished that their general remembered their names, crossed the river as well without fear. This act proved that the Lima was not as dangerous as the local myths described.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] iii. p. 153; [[Mela]], iii, 1; [[Pliny the Elder]] H.N. iv. 22 s. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cádiz]], Spain, the river [[Guadalete]] was originally named "Lethe" by local Greek and Phoenician colonists who, about to go to war, solved instead their differences by diplomacy and named the river Lethe to forever forget their former differences. When the Arabs conquered the region much later, their name for the river became Guadalete ("River Lethe" in Arabic).

In Alaska, a river which runs through the [[Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes]] is called the [[River Lethe]]. It is located within the [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] in southwest Alaska.

''[[Nepenthes hurrelliana]]'' and ''[[Nepenthes murudensis|N. murudensis]]'' are of putative hybrid origin, but are considered species by most [[taxonomists]], as they form stable, fertile populations independent of their original parent species. The same could be said for stable hybrids such as ''[[Nepenthes x kinabaluensis|N &amp;times; kinabaluensis]]''. Indeed, species status has been proposed for this taxon in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, J.H. &amp; C.C. Wilcock 1998 ['1996']. Pitcher plants of Mt. Kinabalu in Sabah.

Complex hybrids involving all three species are also common.&lt;ref name=McPherson /&gt;

All three species from Australia are known to hybridise.

===Outlying areas===
There are six additional species endemic to areas other than those listed above. These are:

* ''[[Nepenthes distillatoria|N. distillatoria]]'' ([[Sri Lanka]])
* ''[[Nepenthes khasiana|N. khasiana]]'' ([[India]])
* ''[[Nepenthes madagascariensis|N. madagascariensis]]'' ([[Madagascar]])
* ''[[Nepenthes masoalensis|N. masoalensis]]'' ([[Madagascar]])
* ''[[Nepenthes pervillei|N. pervillei]]'' ([[Seychelles]])
* ''[[Nepenthes vieillardii|N. vieillardii]]'' ([[New Caledonia]])

Of these, the only species that could conceivably hybridise in the wild are ''[[Nepenthes madagascariensis|N. madagascariensis]]'' and ''[[Nepenthes masoalensis|N. masoalensis]]''. Although the ranges of the two species used to meet near [[Cape Masoala]], no natural hybrids have ever been recorded.&lt;ref name=McPherson /&gt;

[[Venus flytrap]]s are by far the most commonly recognized and cultivated [[carnivorous plant]]. They are sold as houseplants and are often found at florists, hardware stores and supermarkets. During the past ten years or so large quantities of [[cultivar]]s (cultivated varieties) have come into the market through [[Plant tissue culture|tissue culture]] of selected genetic mutations.  It is through tissue culture that great quantities of plants are raised for commercial markets.

The registered cultivars include (name of registrant in braces):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56899">This is the list of notable [[star]]s in the [[constellation]] '''[[Carina (constellation)|Carina]]''', sorted by decreasing brightness.

This constellation's [[Bayer designation]]s (Greek-letter star names) were given while it was still considered part of the constellation of [[Argo Navis]]. After Argo Navis was broken up into Carina, [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], and [[Puppis]], these Greek-letter designations were kept, so that Carina does not have a full complement of Greek-letter designations. For example, since Argo Navis's gamma star went to Vela, there is no Gamma Carinae.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a reliability indicator used by electric power utilities.  MAIFI is the average number of momentary interruptions that a customer would experience during a given period (typically a year).  Electric power utilities may define momentary interruptions differently, with some considering a momentary interruption to be an outage of less than 1 minute in duration while others may consider a momentary interruption to be an outage of less than 5 minutes in duration.

==Calculation==
MAIFI is calculated as

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{MAIFI} = \frac{\mbox{total number of customer interruptions less than the defined time}}{\mbox{total number of customers served}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Reporting==
MAIFI has tended to be less reported than other reliability indicators, such as [[SAIDI]], [[SAIFI]], and [[CAIDI]].  However, MAIFI is useful for tracking momentary power outages, or "blinks," that can be hidden or misrepresented by an overall outage duration index like SAIDI or SAIFI.

==Causes==
Momentary power outages are often caused by transient faults, such as lightning strikes or vegetation contacting a power line, and many utilities use [[autorecloser|reclosers]] to automatically restore power quickly after a transient fault has cleared.

==Comparisons==
MAIFI is specific to the area ( power utility, state, region, county, power line, etc. ) because of the many variables that affect the measure: high/low lightning, number &amp; type of trees, high/low  winds, etc. Therefore, comparing MAIFI of one power utility to another is not valid and should not be used in this type of benchmarking. It also is difficult to compare this measure of reliability
within a single utility. One year may have had an unusually high number of thunderstorms and thus skew any comparison to another year's MAIFI.

'''Mesquite Bosque''' is a [[Association (ecology)|vegetative association]] within the [[Southwestern United States]], under the [[A.W. Kuchler|Kuchler scheme]] of plant association categories.

==Geography==
The Mesquite Bosque association occurs in the [[Sonoran Desert]], with [[Prosopis|mesquite (''Prosopis'' spp.)]] dominating. In some cases, this plant association is along [[xeric]] portions of desert [[floodplain]]s, [[Bajada (geography)|bajada]]s, and [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Scott, Patricia J. Heglund, Michael L. Morrison. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesquite species==
:The mesquite species can include:
*[[Prosopis velutina|Velvet mesquite - ''Prosopis velutina'']]
*[[Prosopis pubescens|Screwbean mesquite - ''Prosopis pubescens'']] - "Tornillo"
*[[Prosopis glandulosa|Honey mesquite - ''Prosopis glandulosa'']]

==Mesquite Bosque plant association species==
*[[Acacia greggii|Catclaw acacia - ''Acacia greggii'']]
*[[Populus fremontii|Fremont cottonwood - ''Populus fremontii'']]
*[[Phoradendron californicum|Desert mistletoe - ''Phoradendron californicum'']]
*[[Washingtonia filifera|California fan palm - ''Washingtonia filifera'']] - the Mesquite Bosque association is one of the Kuchler scheme designation areas where this [[endangered]] palm may occur.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3698">'''Musaeus of Athens''' ({{lang-el|Μουσαῖος}}, ''Mousaios'') was a legendary [[polymath]], philosopher, historian, prophet, seer, priest, poet, and musician, said to have been the founder of priestly poetry in [[Attica, Greece|Attica]]. He composed dedicatory and purificatory [[hymns]] and prose treatises, and oracular responses.

==Attributed works==
[[Herodotus]] reports that, during the reign of [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]] at [[Athens]], the scholar [[Onomacritus]] collected and arranged the oracles of Musaeus but inserted forgeries of his own devising, later detected by [[Lasus of Hermione]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] 7.6.3-5; see also 8.96 and 9.43&lt;/ref&gt; The mystic and oracular verses and customs of Attica, especially of [[Eleusis]], are connected with his name. A ''Titanomachia'' and ''Theogonia'' are also attributed to him by [[Gottfried Kinkel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epicorum graecorum fragmenta'', 1878&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation in antiquity==
In 450 BC, the playwright [[Euripides]] in his play ''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]'' describes him thus, "Musaeus, too, thy holy citizen, of all men most advanced in lore."&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Euripides/rhesus.html Euripides, ''Rhesus'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 380 BC, Plato says in his  ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' that poets are inspired by [[Orpheus]] and Musaeus but the greater are inspired by [[Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/ion.html Plato, ''Ion'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the  ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', [[Plato]] says that Musaeus was a [[hierophant]] and a [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/protagoras.html Plato, ''Protagoras'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', [[Socrates]] says, "What would not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and [[Hesiod]] and Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html Plato, ''Apology'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to  [[Diodorus Siculus]], Musaeus was the son of Orpheus,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1&amp;ndash;2].&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Tatian]] he was the disciple of Orpheus, but according to [[Diogenes Laertius]] he was the son of [[Eumolpus]]. [[Alexander Polyhistor]], [[Clement of Alexandria]] and  [[Eusebius]] say he was the teacher of Orpheus. [[Aristotle]] quotes him in Book VIII of his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'': "Song is to mortals of all things the sweetest." According to Diogenes Laertius he died and was buried at [[Phalerum]], with the epitaph: "Musaeus, to his sire Eumolpus dear, in Phalerean soil lies buried here." According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], he was buried on the [[Philopappos Monument|Mouseion Hill]], south-west of the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 25.8&lt;/ref&gt; where there was a statue dedicated to a Syrian. For this and other reasons, [[Artapanus of Alexandria]], Alexander Polyhistor, [[Numenius of Apamea]], and Eusebius identify Musaeus with [[Moses]] the [[Jewish]] lawbringer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_09_book9.htm Eusebius, ''Praeparatio Evangelica'' IX]&lt;/ref&gt;  Musaeus is singled out in Book 6 of ''[[The Aeneid]]'', as someone who the souls of Elysium particularly looked up to.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''The Aeneid'' 6.667.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1991 the [[Parliament of Norway]] decided to deregulate the market for power trading. In 1993 '''Statnett Marked AS''' was established as an independent company.  Nord Pool market was created in 1996 as a result of the establishment of common electricity market of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. The name was changed to '''Nord Pool ASA'''. It was owned by the two national grid companies, [[Statnett]] in Norway (50%) and [[Svenska Kraftnät]] in Sweden (50%).  [[Finland]] joined Nord Pool market area in 1998, Western Denmark in 1999 and Eastern Denmark in 2000.

In 2000, Nord Pool participated in establishing the [[Leipzig]] Power Exchange (now part of the [[European Energy Exchange]]). Nord Pool also supplied its technology to [[France]]'s [[Powernext]] exchange.  In 2002, [[spot market]] activities were transferred into a newly established company, [[Nord Pool Spot|Nord Pool Spot AS]].  In 2005, Nord Pool started trading and clearing of EU emission allowances, becoming the first exchange to expand its activities into this area.

On 21 December 2007, Nord Pool agreed to sell its two subsidiaries—Nord Pool Clearing, which deals with clearing transactions, and Nord Pool Consulting—to the global exchange operator NASDAQ OMX.&lt;ref name=reuters211207&gt;

[[Austria]] has seven [[protected area]]s known as [[national park]]s, six of them internationally accepted according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] standard. The first national park, [[Hohe Tauern]], was established in 1981. Today the '''national parks of Austria''' have a combined area of 2,376 km², which is 2.8% of the country's total area.&lt;ref name=Nationalparks&gt;{{cite web

==Development==
[[File:Karte Nationalparks Österreich.png|thumb|Outline map]]
First plans for the protection of the Hohe Tauern mountain range were evolved by [[Austrian Alpine Club]], which in 1915-18 acquired large mountainous areas. However, the national park project was abandoned in the late 1930s and not resumed until 1971, when the [[States of Austria|federal states]] of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Carinthia]] signed the [[Heiligenblut am Großglockner|Heiligenblut]] Agreement, followed by similar initiatives in [[Lower Austria|Lower]] and [[Upper Austria]].

The establishment of each national park took several years; as conflicts of use and the question of funding had to be resolved. The parks are managed by contracts between one or more of the [[States of Austria|federal states]] and the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]],&lt;ref name=OECD/&gt; with the financing shared equally between the Austrian government and the respective province.&lt;ref name=Nationalparks/&gt; The national park administrations offer more than 300 [[green job]]s. The park centres provide the public with educational services on [[ecology]] and [[environmental protection]], information and leisure activities.&lt;ref name=OECD/&gt; With about 400,000 visitors a year, they play an important role in [[Tourism in Austria|Austrian tourism]].

==National Parks==
Of the seven national parks, four are protecting Austrian [[Eastern Alps|Alpine]] regions and three are covering waters. The largest park by far is [[Hohe Tauern]]; at {{convert|1856|km2|acre}}, it is also the largest national park in [[Central Europe]]. The [[National Park Neusiedler See-Seewinkel|Neusiedler See–Seewinkel]] and [[Thaya]]tal national parks stretch across the border with [[Hungary]] and the [[Czech Republic]] respectively.

All of Austria's national parks meet [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN Category II]] standards, with the exception of the [[Nock Mountains]] National Park, which had been classified as a Protected Landscape (Category V). In 2012, it was converted into the core zone of a UNESCO [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]].

==Sailing dedicated to the Science ==

In November 2006, [[Yvan Griboval]] creates the ''OceanoScientific Programme'' for SailingOne. The ''OceanoScientific Programme'' is the set of activities designed to enable the international scientific community and the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] to enrich their knowledge about the causes and consequences of climate change, through the repeated collection of quality data at the ocean - atmosphere interface (oceanographic and atmospheric), especially on sea routes subject to little or no scientific exploration, aboard all kind of vessels but especially sailing ships; guided by JCOMMOPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wo.jcommops.org/cgi-bin/WebObjects/JCOMMOPS |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080512195550/http://wo.jcommops.org/cgi-bin/WebObjects/JCOMMOPS |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the support centre of the Joint [[WMO]] - [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission|IOC]] Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology of the United Nations.

IPCC, WMO and IOC are specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN).

The two main contractual partners of the ''OceanoScientific Programme'' from the start are the French research institutes [[IFREMER]]&lt;ref&gt;http://wwz.ifremer.fr/lpo/La-recherche/Projets-en-cours/GLOSCAL/SSS-Voiliers&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Météo-France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnrm-game-meteo.fr/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial partner of the ''OceanoScientific Programme'' is the German company SubCtech,&lt;ref&gt;http://subctech.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; headed and created by Stefan Marx, who created a ''p''CO2 sensor. This sensor was compared to others on board the research vessel ''Polarstern''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanoscientific.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/reportberichte-pco2-polarstern.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yvan Griboval - Its creator ==

Self-made man with a scholarship in Rouen (France), Yvan Griboval has early married his passions for sailing and for media, combining the job of professional sportsman, as from 1975  and of journalist-reporter, as from 1979 in French media: [[L'Équipe|L’Équipe]], [[Agence France-Presse|Agence France Presse]], Voiles &amp; Voiliers, [[France Télévisions|France Télévision]].

Yvan Griboval took part in the win of ''L’Esprit d’Équipe'' with Lionel Péan at the [[1985–86 Whitbread Round the World Race|Whitbread 1985-86]] (now the [[Volvo Ocean Race]]), the crewed race around the world.

Then he put his experience and know-how at the service of companies as from 1987–88, to guide them in their event-driven communication processes based on the exploitation of the Yachting in general and the Sailing, of its competitions, of its champions.

Founder and president of the company SailingOne ever since its inception (December 1994), he created the ''Trophée of Sailing Champions'' in 1990.  As from its first edition, the French version of this event was named the ''Trophée Clairefontaine''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tropheeclairefontaine.com/&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to the partnership established in the spring 1990 with the eponymous papermaker group (Groupe des Papeteries de Clairefontaine). In November 2006, Yvan Griboval creates the ''OceanoScientific Programme''.

== A unique material (collecting oceanographic and meteorologic data) ==

As from early 2007, Yvan Griboval creates the ''OceanoScientific System'', which is a component of the ''OceanoScientific Programme'' and the tool for ''OceanoScientific Campaigns''. This is a "Plug &amp; Play" equipment for the automatic acquisition and transmission by satellite of at least twelve scientific (oceanographic and atmospheric) parameters - formatted according to the standards of [[United Nations|UN]] agencies. The OSC System is a technological development without any equivalent anywhere in the world when it works for the first time, on 14 October 2009. It makes possible for scientists the access to a new fleet of vessels of opportunity: sailing boats especially dedicated to these scientific missions. A scientific publication was carried out after the first test-expedition in the French Revue de l’Electricité et de l’Electronique (REE),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanoscientific.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/articleree1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2010.

== Data transmission to the International Scientific Community ==
Yvan Griboval initiates then the ''OceanoScientific Campaigns'', standing for the implementation of the ''OceanoScientific System''. It therefore involves the repeated collection of quality data at the ocean - atmosphere interface and their transmission to the oceanography and meteorology international platforms of the specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN). Data of ''OceanoScientific Campaigns'' are transmitted free of charge to the international scientific community considering its own criteria. They are integrated into the [[GOOS|Global Ocean Observing System]] (GOOS), for example via WMO’s [[Global Telecommunication System]] (GTS). These observations contribute to improve meteorological and climatological forecasts in scarcely or not at all scientifically explored ocean areas.

The two first campaigns carried out are: The ''ARTIC MISSION 2012''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanoscientific.org/en/2012/09/12/retour-de-la-mission-arctique-2012/&lt;/ref&gt; on the schooner ''La Louise''&lt;ref&gt;http://lalouise.fr/La_Louise/Accueil_2.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Baffin Bay]] between 65° and 70° North; the 96-days ''ANTARCTIC MISSION 2013'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanoscientific.org/en/2013/04/29/mission-antarctique-2013-accomplie-avec-succes/&lt;/ref&gt; on the three-master ''[[Europa (ship)|Bark EUROPA]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://barkeuropa.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barkeuropa.com/news/15/2013/2/11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606233131/http://www.barkeuropa.com/news/15/2013/2/11 |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Netherlands) between 50° and 63° South, especially in the [[Drake Passage]].

== ''OceanoScientific Campaign 2013 - 2014'' ==

Started from Brest (France) on 28 November 2013, the ''OceanoScientific Campaign - ATLANTIC MISSION 2013 - 2014'', led on the 16-meter Navire A Voile d’Observation Scientifique de l’Environnement (NAVOSE) bearing the colours of the MEROCEANS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meroceans.org/&lt;/ref&gt; foundation, came to an end in [[Monaco]] on 26 April 2014. In addition to the tests of the ''OceanoScientific System'' (OSC System) Version 3.0, a unique material collecting data of ten scientific parameters at the ocean - atmosphere interface, this 10,000 nautical miles (18,520&amp;nbsp;km) expedition enabled the deployment of drifting scientific materials in compliance with the requirements of JCOMMOPS, a [[UNESCO]] agency. In the meantime, the OSC System won the 2013 French-German Prize of Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.francoallemand.com/fr/manifestations/prix-franco-allemand-de-leconomie-2013/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607000613/http://www.francoallemand.com/fr/manifestations/prix-franco-allemand-de-leconomie-2013/ |archivedate=2014-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Environment category. As from now one, the scientific data collected by the OSC System will be transmitted to the CORIOLIS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coriolis.eu.org/&lt;/ref&gt; network. This Campaign was carried out in energy self-sufficiency, without any CO2 emission, thanks to the hydro generators installed on board.

'''Paleoclimatology''' (in [[British spelling]], '''palaeoclimatology''') is the study of [[climate change|changes]] in [[climate]] taken on the scale of the entire [[history of Earth]]. It uses a variety of [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] methods from the [[Earth sciences|Earth]] and [[life sciences]] to obtain data previously preserved within things such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[sediment]]s, [[ice sheet]]s, [[tree ring]]s, [[coral]]s, [[mollusc shell|shells]], and [[microfossil]]s. It then uses the records to determine the past states of the [[Earth]]'s various climate regions and its [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] system. Studies of past changes in the environment and biodiversity often reflect on the current situation, specifically the impact of climate on [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]] and biotic recovery.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf |author1=Sahney, S. |author2=Benton, M.J. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2008 |title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 |volume= 275 |pages= 759–65|format=PDF |pmid=18198148 |issue=1636 |pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of climate change science|Historical climatology}}
The scientific study field of paleoclimate began to form in the early 19th century, when discoveries about glaciations and natural changes in Earth's past climate helped to understand the [[greenhouse effect]].The first observations which had a real scientific basis were probably those by John Hardcastle in New Zealand, in the 1880s. He noted that the [[loess]] deposits at Timaru in the South Island recorded changes in climate; he called the loess a 'climate register'.&lt;ref&gt;Hardcastle,J. 1890. On the Timaru loess as a climate register. Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute 23, 324-332. also Loess Letter 71, www.loessletter.msu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Proxy (climate)}}
Paleoclimatologists employ a wide variety of techniques to deduce ancient climates.

===Ice===
Mountain [[glacier]]s and the polar [[ice caps]]/[[ice sheets]] provide much data in paleoclimatology. Ice-coring projects in the ice caps of [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] have yielded data going back several hundred thousand years, over 800,000 years in the case of the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica|EPICA]] project.
:*Air trapped within fallen [[snow]] becomes encased in tiny bubbles as the snow is compressed into ice in the glacier under the weight of later years' snow. The trapped air has proven a tremendously valuable source for direct measurement of the composition of air from the time the ice was formed.
:*Layering can be observed because of seasonal pauses in ice accumulation and can be used to establish chronology, associating specific depths of the core with ranges of time.
:*Changes in the layering thickness can be used to determine changes in precipitation or temperature.
:*[[Oxygen-18]] quantity changes ({{delta|18|O|link}}) in ice layers represent changes in average ocean surface temperature. Water molecules containing the heavier O-18 evaporate at a higher temperature than water molecules containing the normal [[Oxygen-16]] isotope. The ratio of O-18 to O-16 will be higher as temperature increases. It also depends on other factors such as the water's salinity and the volume of water locked up in ice sheets. Various cycles in those isotope ratios have been detected.
:*[[Pollen#Pollen in the fossil record|Pollen]] has been observed in the ice cores and can be used to understand which plants were present as the layer formed. Pollen is produced in abundance and its distribution is typically well understood. A pollen count for a specific layer can be produced by observing the total amount of pollen categorized by type (shape) in a controlled sample of that layer. Changes in plant frequency over time can be plotted through statistical analysis of pollen counts in the core. Knowing which plants were present leads to an understanding of precipitation and temperature, and types of fauna present. [[Palynology]] includes the study of pollen for these purposes.
:*[[Volcanic ash]] is contained in some layers, and can be used to establish the time of the layer's formation. Each volcanic event distributed ash with a unique set of properties (shape and color of particles, chemical signature). Establishing the ash's source will establish a range of time to associate with layer of ice.

===Dendroclimatology===
{{Main|Dendroclimatology}}
Climatic information can be obtained through an understanding of changes in tree growth. Generally, trees respond to changes in climatic variables by speeding up or slowing down growth, which in turn is generally reflected by a greater or lesser thickness in growth rings. Different species, however, respond to changes in climatic variables in different ways. A tree-ring record is established by compiling information from many living trees in a specific area.

Older intact wood that has escaped decay can extend the time covered by the record by matching the ring depth changes to contemporary specimens. By using that method, some areas have tree-ring records dating back a few thousand years. Older wood not connected to a contemporary record can be dated generally with radiocarbon techniques. A tree-ring record can be used to produce information regarding precipitation, temperature, hydrology, and fire corresponding to a particular area.

===Sedimentary content===
On a longer time scale, geologists must refer to the sedimentary record for data.

:*Sediments, sometimes lithified to form rock, may contain remnants of preserved vegetation, animals, plankton, or [[palynology|pollen]], which may be characteristic of certain climatic zones.
:*Biomarker molecules such as the [[alkenones]] may yield information about their temperature of formation.
:*Chemical signatures, particularly [[Mg/Ca]] ratio of [[calcite]] in [[Foraminifera]] tests, can be used to reconstruct past temperature.
:*Isotopic ratios can provide further information. Specifically, the {{delta|18|O|link}} record responds to changes in temperature and ice volume, and the {{delta|13|C|link}} record reflects a range of factors, which are often difficult to disentangle.
[[File:Core+Repository+core samples2.jpg|right|thumb|Sea floor core sample labelled to identify the exact spot on the sea floor where the sample was taken. Sediments from nearby locations can show significant differences in chemical and biological composition.]]
;[[Sedimentary facies]]: On a longer time scale, the rock record may show signs of [[sea level rise]] and fall, and features such as [[Dune#Lithified dunes|"fossilised" sand dunes]] can be identified. Scientists can get a grasp of long term climate by studying [[sedimentary rock]] going back billions of years. The division of earth history into separate periods is largely based on visible changes in sedimentary rock layers that demarcate major changes in conditions. Often, they include major shifts in climate.

===Sclerochronology===
;Corals (see also [[sclerochronology]]): Coral "rings" are similar to tree rings except that they respond to different things, such as the water temperature, freshwater influx, pH changes, and wave action. From there, certain equipment can be used to derive the sea surface temperature and water salinity from the past few centuries. The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of [[coralline algae|coralline]] red algae provides a useful proxy of the combined sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity at high latitudes and the tropics, where many traditional techniques are limited.&lt;ref name=Geology2008&gt;{{cite journal |author= Halfar, J. |year= 2008 |doi= 10.1130/G24635A.1 |title= Coralline red algae as high-resolution climate recorders |journal= Geology |volume= 36 |pages= 463 |last2= Steneck |first2= R.S. |last3= Joachimski |first3= M. |last4= Kronz |first4= A. |last5= Wanamaker |first5= A.D. |issue= 6|bibcode= 2008Geo....36..463H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cobb&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cobb, K. |year= 2003 |title= El Nino/Southern Oscillation and tropical Pacific climate during the past millennium |journal= Nature |volume= 424 |issue= 6946 |pages= 271–6 |pmid= 12867972 |last2= Charles |first2= C.

===Landscapes and landforms===
Within [[climatic geomorphology]] one approach is to study [[relict (geology)|relict landforms]] to infer ancient climates.&lt;ref name=Gutix2&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285964375_Climatic_Geomorphology|chapter=Climatic Geomorphology|title=Treatise on Geomorphology|volume=13|author-last=Gutiérrez|first=Mateo |last2=Gutiérrez|first2=Francisco|year=2013|pages=115–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being often concerned about past climates climatic geomorphology is considered sometimes to be a theme of [[historical geology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=2005|chapter=Chapter 1 Climatic geomorphology |title=Developments in Earth Surface Processes|editor-last=Gutiérrez|editor-first=Mateo |url= |location= |publisher=|volume=8 |pages=3–32 |isbn= |author-link=|doi=10.1016/S0928-2025(05)80051-3|ISBN=978-0-444-51794-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climatic geomorphology is of limited use to study recent ([[Quaternary]], [[Holocene]]) large climate changes since there are seldom discernible in the geomorphological record.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Goudie|first=A.S.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Climatic geomorphology|year=2004|pages=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time Scale and Limitations===
A multinational consortium, the [[European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica]] (EPICA), has drilled an ice core in Dome C on the East Antarctic ice sheet and retrieved ice from roughly 800,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jouzel|first=Jean|title=Orbital and Millennial Antarctic Climate Variability over the Past 800,000 Years|journal=Science|date=10 August 2007|volume=317|pages=793–796|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5839/793.abstract|doi=10.1126/science.1141038|last2=Masson-Delmotte|first2=V.|last3=Cattani|first3=O.|last4=Dreyfus|first4=G.|last5=Falourd|first5=S.|last6=Hoffmann|first6=G.|last7=Minster|first7=B.|last8=Nouet|first8=J.|last9=Barnola|first9=J.

Older sediments are also more prone to corruption by [[diagenesis]]. Resolution and confidence in the data decrease over time.

==Notable climate events in Earth history==
{{See also|List of periods and events in climate history|Geologic time scale|History of Earth}}

Knowledge of precise climatic events decreases as the record goes back in time, but some notable climate events are known:
* [[Faint young Sun paradox]] (start)
* [[Huronian glaciation]] (~2400 Mya Earth completely covered in ice probably due to [[Great Oxygenation Event]])
* Later Neoproterozoic [[Snowball Earth]] (~600 Mya, precursor to the [[Cambrian Explosion]])
* [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] (~450 Mya)

* [[Little Ice Age]] (1300–1800)
* [[Year Without a Summer]] (1816)

==History of the atmosphere==
{{Life timeline}}
{{See also|Atmosphere of Earth|History of Earth}}

===Earliest atmosphere===
The [[paleoatmosphere|first atmosphere]] would have consisted of gases in the [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|solar nebula]], primarily [[hydrogen]]. In addition, there would probably have been simple [[hydride]]s such as those now found in gas giants like [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], notably [[water]] vapor, [[methane]], and [[ammonia]]. As the solar nebula dissipated, the gases would have escaped, partly driven off by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=Zahnle&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Zahnle |first1= K. |last2= Schaefer |first2= L. |last3= Fegley |first3= B. |doi= 10.1101/cshperspect.a004895 |title= Earth's Earliest Atmospheres |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume= 2 |issue= 10 |pages= a004895 |year= 2010 |pmid= 20573713 |pmc= 2944365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second atmosphere===
The next atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and inert gases, was produced by outgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge [[asteroids]].&lt;ref name=Zahnle/&gt; A major part of carbon dioxide emissions were soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.

Water-related sediments have been found dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;B. Windley: ''The Evolving Continents.'' Wiley Press, New York 1984&lt;/ref&gt; About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen was the major part of the then stable "second atmosphere". An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere because hints of early life forms have been dated to as early as 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;J. Schopf: ''Earth's Earliest Biosphere: Its Origin and Evolution.'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that it is not perfectly in line with the 30% lower solar radiance (compared to today) of the early Sun has been described as the "[[faint young Sun paradox]]".

The geological record, however, shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early [[temperature record]] of Earth with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late [[Archean|Archaean]] eon, an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently from photosynthesizing [[cyanobacteria]] (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]) which have been found as [[stromatolite]] fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy ([[isotope ratio]] proportions) was very much in line with what is found today, suggesting that the fundamental features of the [[carbon cycle]] were established as early as 4 billion years ago.

===Third atmosphere===
The constant rearrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago, during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], and its appearance is indicated by the end of the [[banded iron formations]]. Until then, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials. That point was a shift from a [[redox|reducing]] atmosphere to an [[oxidizing]] atmosphere. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Scotese, [http://www.scotese.com/precamb_chart.htm Back to Earth History: Summary Chart for the Precambrian], Paleomar Project&lt;/ref&gt; The following time span was the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, during which oxygen-breathing [[metazoan]] life forms began to appear.

The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of 35%&lt;ref name=Beerling2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling|first=David|authorlink= David Beerling|year=2007|title=The emerald planet: how plants changed Earth's history|publisher=Oxford University press|isbn=9780192806024|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Carboniferous]] period, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: plants [[photosynthesis|use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]], releasing oxygen and the breakdown of [[pyrite]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s release [[sulfur]] into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for rapid development of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward:[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11630] Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate during geological ages==
[[File:GlaciationsinEarthExistancelicenced annotated.jpg|thumb|600px|right|Timeline of glaciations, shown in blue]]
{{See also|Timeline of glaciation}}
* The [[Huronian glaciation]], is the first known glaciation in Earth's history, and lasted from 2400-2100 million years ago.
* The [[Cryogenian glaciation]] lasted from 720-635 million years ago.
* The [[Andean-Saharan glaciation]] lasted from 450–420 million years ago.
* The [[Karoo glaciation]] lasted from 360–260 million years ago.
* The [[Quaternary glaciation]] is the current glaciation period and began 2.58 million years ago.

===Precambrian climate===
{{Main|Precambrian}}
The climate of the late Precambrian showed some major [[glaciation]] events spreading over much of the earth. At this time the continents were bunched up in the [[Rodinia]] supercontinent. Massive deposits of [[tillite]]s and anomalous [[isotopic signature]]s are found, which gave rise to the [[Snowball Earth]] hypothesis. As the [[Proterozoic|Proterozoic Eon]] drew to a close, the Earth started to warm up. By the dawn of the Cambrian and the Phanerozoic, life forms were abundant in the [[Cambrian explosion]] with average global temperatures of about 22 °[[Celsius|C]].

===Phanerozoic climate===
[[File:Phanerozoic Climate Change.png|thumb|450px|500 million years of climate change]]
{{Main|Phanerozoic}}
Major drivers for the preindustrial ages have been variations of the sun, volcanic ashes and exhalations, relative movements of the earth towards the sun, and tectonically induced effects as for major sea currents, watersheds, and ocean oscillations. In the early Phanerozoic, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have been linked to driving or amplifying increased global temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosemarie E.

The difference in global mean temperatures between a fully glacial Earth and an ice free Earth is estimated at approximately 10&amp;nbsp;°C, though far larger changes would be observed at high latitudes and smaller ones at low latitudes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} One requirement for the development of large scale ice sheets seems to be the arrangement of continental land masses at or near the poles. The constant rearrangement of continents by [[plate tectonics]] can also shape long-term climate evolution. However, the presence or absence of land masses at the poles is not sufficient to guarantee glaciations or exclude polar ice caps. Evidence exists of past warm periods in Earth's climate when polar land masses similar to [[Antarctica]] were home to [[deciduous]] forests rather than ice sheets.

The relatively warm local minimum between [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] goes along with an increase of subduction and mid-ocean ridge volcanism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douwe G. Van Der Meer, Richard E. Zeebe, Douwe J. J. van Hinsbergen, Appy Sluijs, Wim Spakman, and Trond H.

Superimposed on the long-term evolution between hot and cold climates have been many short-term fluctuations in climate similar to, and sometimes more severe than, the varying glacial and interglacial states of the present [[ice age]]. Some of the most severe fluctuations, such as the [[Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]], may be related to rapid climate changes due to sudden collapses of natural [[methane clathrate]] reservoirs in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frieling|first=Joost|last2=Svensen|first2=Henrik H.|last3=Planke|first3=Sverre|last4=Cramwinckel|first4=Margot J.|last5=Selnes|first5=Haavard|last6=Sluijs|first6=Appy|date=25 October 2016|title=Thermogenic methane release as a cause for the long duration of the PETM|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/43/12059|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=43|pages=12059–12064|doi=10.1073/pnas.1603348113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27790990|pmc=5087067|bibcode=2016PNAS..11312059F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar, single event of induced severe climate change after a [[meteorite impact]] has been proposed as reason for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. Other major thresholds are the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic]], and [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events]] with various reasons suggested.

The [[Quaternary]] sub-era includes the current climate. There has been a cycle of [[ice age]]s for the past 2.2–2.1 million years (starting before the Quaternary in the late [[Neogene]] Period).

Note in the graphic on the right the strong 120,000-year periodicity of the cycles, and the striking asymmetry of the curves. This asymmetry is believed to result from complex interactions of feedback mechanisms. It has been observed that ice ages deepen by progressive steps, but the recovery to interglacial conditions occurs in one big step.

==Climate forcings==
[[File:Radiative-forcings.svg|thumb|right|300px|Radiative forcings, IPCC (2007)]]
{{Main|Climate change#Causes}}
The [[climate forcing]] is the difference of radiant energy ([[sunlight]]) received by the Earth and the outgoing [[outgoing longwave radiation|longwave radiation]] back to space. The radiative forcing is quantified based on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amount in the [[tropopause]], in units of watts per square meter to the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|year=2007

|title= Concept of Radiative Forcing
|url= https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-2.html
|publisher= [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependent on the [[radiative balance]] of incoming and outgoing energy, the Earth either warms up or cools down. Earth radiative balance originates from changes in solar [[insolation]] and the concentrations of [[greenhouse gases]] and [[aerosols]]. Climate change may be due to internal processes in Earth sphere's and/or following external forcings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal processes and forcings===
The Earth's climate system involves the study of the [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]], [[cryosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[lithosphere]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher =NASA|title=Glossary, Climate system|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Glossary/index.php?mode=alpha&amp;seg=b&amp;segend=d}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sum of these processes from Earth sphere's is considered the processes affecting the climate. Greenhouse gases act as the internal forcing of the climate system. Particular interests in climate science and paleoclimatology focuses on the study of Earth [[climate sensitivity]], in response to the sum of forcings.

Examples:
* [[Thermohaline circulation]] (Hydrosphere)
* [[Life]] (Biosphere)

===External forcings===
* The [[Milankovitch cycles]] determine Earth distance and position to the Sun. The solar insolation is the total amount of solar radiation received by Earth.
* Volcanic eruptions are considered an external forcing.&lt;ref name="IPCC AR5"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=IPCC AR5|url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_AnnexIII_FINAL.pdf|title=Annex III: Glossary|quote=Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings, such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Human changes of the composition of the atmosphere or land use.&lt;ref name="IPCC AR5"/&gt;

===Mechanisms===
On timescales of millions of years, the uplift of mountain ranges and subsequent [[weathering]] processes of rocks and soils and the [[subduction]] of [[tectonic plates]], are an important part of the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caldeira|first=Ken|title=Enhanced Cenozoic chemical weathering and the subduction of pelagic carbonate|journal=Nature|date= 18 June 1992|volume=357|pages=578–581|doi=10.1038/357578a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v357/n6379/abs/357578a0.html|issue=6379|bibcode=1992Natur.357..578C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Cin-Ty Aeolus Lee, Douglas M.

==History==
Periglaciation became a distinct subject within the study of geology after [[Walery Łoziński]], a Polish geologist, introduced the term in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the field trip to [[Svalbard]] that followed the congress participants were able to observe the phenomena reported by Łoziński, directly. Łoziński published his contribution to the congress in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mroczek |first=Przemysław|date=2010|title=Stulecie pojêcia peryglacja |url=https://www.pgi.gov.pl/images/stories/przeglad/2010rok/pg_2010_02_19.pdf |journal=Przegląd Geologiczny |publisher= |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=130–132 |doi= |access-date=|language=Polish }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1950 to 1970, periglacial geomorphology developed chiefly as a subdiscipline of [[climatic geomorphology]] that was current in Europe at the time.&lt;ref name=French2007intro&gt;French 2007, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ''[[Biuletyn Peryglacjalny]]'', established in 1954 by [[Jan Dylik]], was important for the consolidation of the discipline.&lt;ref name=thehistory&gt;{{cite book |last=French |first=Hugh M. |date=2008 |series=The History of the Study of Landforms: Or the Development of Geomorphology|volume=4 |title= Quaternary and Recent Processes and Forms (1890–1965) and the Mid-Century Revolutions|editor-last=Burt|editor-first=T.P. |editor-last2=Chorley|editor-first2=R.J.|editor-last3=Brunsden|editor-first3=D.|editor-last4=Cox|editor-first4=N.J.|editor-last5=Goudie|editor-first5=A.S.|editor-link2=Richard Chorley|editor-link5=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=wg0Rl7dY5ZYC&amp;pg=PA649&amp;lpg=PA649&amp;dq=biuletyn+peryglacjalny&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7HuDC4WyGp&amp;sig=xrB53kVYnoWwEPze6SALhVnC2bY&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGrOnftK3PAhVHPJAKHRZUAXgQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Dylik&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |pages=647–49 |isbn=1862392498|chapter=Periglacial Processes and Forms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periglacial zones and climates==
{{see also|Climatic geomorphology}}
Albeit the definition of what a periglacial zone is not clear-cut, a conservative estimate is that a quarter of Earth's land surface has periglacial conditions. Beyond this quarter an additional quarter or fifth or Earth's land surface had periglacial conditions at some time during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=French2007-11-13&gt;French 2007, pp.  11–13&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern hemisphere larger swathes of northern Asia and northern North America are periglaciated. In Europe parts of [[Fennoscandia]], [[Iceland]], northern [[European Russia]] and [[Svalbard]]. In addition Alpine areas in the non-arctic northern hemisphere might also be subject to periglaciation. A major outlier in the northern hemisphere is the [[Tibetan Plateau]] that stands out by its size and low-latitude location.&lt;ref name=French2007-11-13/&gt; In the southern hemisphere parts of the [[Andes]], the ice-free areas of [[Antarctica]] and the [[List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands|sub-Antarctic islands]] are periglaciated.&lt;ref name=French2007-11-13/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boelhouwers |first1=Jan |last2=Holness |first2=Steve |last3=Sumner |first3=Paul |date=2003 |title=The maritime Subantarctic: a distinct periglacial environment |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |publisher=Elsevier |volume=52 |issue= |pages=39–55 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Carl Troll]] introduced the concept of periglacial climate in 1944 there have various attempts to classify the diversity of periglacial climates. Hugh M. French’s classification recognizes six climate types existing in the present:&lt;ref&gt;French 2007, pp.  32–34&lt;/ref&gt;
*High Arctic climates
*Continental climates
*Alpine climates
*Climate of the [[Tibetan Plateau|Qinghai-Xizang plateau]]
*Climates of low annual temperature range
*Climate of dry unglaciated areas of Antarctica

===Factors affecting location===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
*Latitude – temperatures tend to be higher towards the equator. Periglacial environments tend to be found in higher [[latitude]]s. Since there is more land at these latitudes in the north, most of this effect is seen in the northern hemisphere. However, in lower latitudes, the direct effect of the sun's radiation is greater so the freeze-thaw effect is seen but permafrost is much less widespread.
*Altitude – Air temperature drops by approximately 1&amp;nbsp;°C for every 100 m rise above sea level. This means that on mountain ranges, modern periglacial conditions are found nearer the [[Equator]] than they are lower down.
*Ocean Currents – Cold surface currents from polar regions, reduce mean average temperatures in places where they exert their effect so that ice caps and periglacial conditions will show nearer to the Equator as in [[Labrador]] for example. Conversely, warm surface currents from tropical seas increases mean temperatures. The cold conditions are then found only in more northerly places. This is apparent in western North America which is affected by the North Pacific current. In the same way but more markedly, the Gulf Stream affects Western Europe.
*[[Continentality]] – Away from the moderating influence of the ocean, seasonal temperature variation is more extreme and freeze-thaw goes deeper. In the centres of Canada and Siberia, the permafrost typical of periglaciation goes deeper and extends further towards the Equator. Similarly, solifluction associated with freeze-thaw extends into somewhat lower latitudes than on western coasts.

==Landforms of periglaciation==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
{{distinguish|paraglacial}}
[[Image:Frost hexagons.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A '''blockfield''' around 4000m on [[Mount Kenya]]]]
[[File:HickoryRunBoulderField2007.jpg|thumb|right|A boulder field in [[Pennsylvania]]]]

Periglaciation results in a variety of ground conditions but especially those involving irregular, mixed deposits created by [[ice wedge]]s, [[solifluction]], [[gelifluction]], [[frost creep]] and [[rockfall]]s. Periglacial environments trend towards stable geomorphologies.&lt;ref&gt;Brundsen, D (2001). A critical assessment of the sensitivity concept in geomorphology. ''Catena'' vol. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Coombe and head deposits – Coombe deposits are chalk deposits found below chalk escarpments in Southern England. Head deposits are more common below outcrops of granite on [[Dartmoor]].
*[[Patterned Ground]] – Patterned ground occurs where stones form circles, polygons and stripes. Local topography affects which of these are expressed. A process called [[frost heaving]] is responsible for these features.
*Solifluction lobes – Solifluction lobes are formed when waterlogged soil slips down a slope due to gravity forming U shaped lobes.
*[[Blockfield]]s or Felsenmeer – Blockfields are areas covered by large angular blocks, traditionally believed to have been created by freeze-thaw action.  A good example of a blockfield can be found in the [[Snowdonia National Park]], Wales.  Blockfields are common in the unglaciated parts of the Appalachian Mountains in the northeastern United States, such as at the [[Hawk Mountain|River of Rocks]] or [[Hickory Run State Park|Hickory Run Boulder Field]], [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]], [[Pennsylvania]].
 
'''Other landforms include:'''
*[[Bratschen]]
*[[Palsa]]
*[[Pingo]]
*[[Rock glacier]]
*[[Thermokarst]]

==River activity==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Many areas of periglaciation have relatively low precipitation—otherwise, they would be glaciated—and low [[evapotranspiration]]. which makes their average river discharge rates low. However, rivers flowing into the [[Arctic Ocean]] adjacent to northern Canada and Siberia are prone to [[erosion]] resulting from earlier thawing of snow pack in the upper, more southerly reaches of their [[drainage basin]]s, which leads to flooding downstream, owing to obstructing river ice in the still-frozen, downstream parts of the rivers. When these ice dams melt or break open, the release of impounded water causes erosion.

The '''Princeton Ocean Model''' ('''POM''') is a community general [[numerical model]] for [[ocean circulation]] that can be used to simulate and predict oceanic currents, temperatures, [[salinity|salinities]] and other water properties.

==Development==
The model code&lt;ref&gt;see POM web, [http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/POMWEB/]&lt;/ref&gt; was originally developed at [[Princeton University]] (G. Mellor and [[Alan Blumberg]]) in collaboration with [[Dynalysis of Princeton]] (H. James Herring, Richard C. Patchen). The model incorporates the [[Mellor–Yamada turbulence scheme]] developed in the early 1970s by George Mellor and Ted Yamada; this turbulence sub-model is widely used by oceanic and atmospheric models. At the time, early computer ocean models such as the Bryan–Cox model (developed in the late 1960s at the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]], GFDL, and later became the [[Modular Ocean Model]], MOM)), were aimed mostly at coarse-resolution simulations of the large-scale ocean circulation, so there was a need for a numerical model that can handle high-resolution coastal ocean processes. The Blumberg–Mellor&lt;ref&gt;Blumberg, A. F. and G. L. Mellor, A description of a three-dimensional coastal ocean circulation model. Three-Dimensional Coastal ocean Models, edited by N. Heaps, 208 pp., American Geophysical Union., 1987&lt;/ref&gt; model (which later became POM) thus included new features such as free surface to handle tides, sigma vertical coordinates (i.e., terrain-following) to handle complex topographies and shallow regions, a curvilinear grid to better handle coastlines, and a turbulence scheme to handle vertical mixing. At the early 1980s the model was used primarily to simulate estuaries such as the [[Hudson–Raritan Estuary]] (by Leo Oey) and the [[Delaware Bay]] (Boris Galperin), but also first attempts to use a sigma coordinate model for basin-scale problems have started with the coarse resolution model of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (Blumberg and Mellor) and models of the Arctic Ocean (with the inclusion of ice-ocean coupling by Lakshmi Kantha and Sirpa Hakkinen).

In the early 1990s when the web and browsers started to be developed, POM became one of the first ocean model codes that were provided free of charge to users through the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.aos.princeton.edu/WWWPUBLIC/htdocs.pom/ | title=The Princeton Ocean Model | publisher=The Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS), Princeton University | accessdate=2010-11-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702070016/http://www.aos.princeton.edu/WWWPUBLIC/htdocs.pom/ | archivedate=July 2, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of the POM users group and its web support (by Tal Ezer) resulted in a continuous increase in the number of POM users which grew from about a dozen U.S. users in the 1980s to over 1000 users in 2000 and over 4000 users by 2009; there are users from over 70 different countries. In the 1990s the usage of POM expands to simulations of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] (Zavatarelli&lt;ref&gt;Zavatarelli, M. and G. L. Mellor, A numerical study of the Mediterranean Sea circulation. J. Phys. Oceanogr., Vol. 25, No. 6, Part II, 1384–1414, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;) and the first simulations with a sigma coordinate model of the entire Atlantic Ocean&lt;ref&gt;Ezer, T. and G. L.

Malanotte-Rizzoli Ed., Elsevier Oceanog. Ser., 61, 347–376, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;). Operational forecast system for other regions such as the Great Lakes, the [[Gulf of Mexico]] (Oey), the [[Gulf of Maine]] (Huijie Xue) and the [[Hudson River]] (Blumberg) followed. For more information on applications of the model, see the searchable database of over 1800 POM-related publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~tezer/POMDB/references.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivatives and other models==
In the late 1990s and the 2000s many other terrain-following community ocean models have been developed; some of their features can be traced back to features included in the original POM, other features are additional numerical and parameterization improvements. Several ocean models are direct descendents of POM such as the commercial version of POM known as the estuarine and coastal ocean model (ECOM), the navy coastal ocean model (NCOM) and the finite-volume coastal ocean model ([[FVCOM]]). Recent developments in POM include a generalized coordinate system that combines sigma and z-level grids (Mellor and Ezer), inundation features that allow simulations of wetting and drying (e.g., flood of land area) (Oey), and coupling ocean currents with surface waves (Mellor). Efforts to improve turbulent mixing also continue (Galperin, Kantha, Mellor and others).

'''Radiation Portal Monitors''' ('''RPM'''s) are passive radiation detection devices used for the screening of individuals, vehicles, cargo or other vectors for detection of illicit sources such as at borders or secure facilities. Fear of terrorist attacks with radiological weapons spurred RPM deployment for [[cargo scanning]] since [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]], particularly in the United States.

==Application==
RPMs were originally developed for screening individuals and vehicles at secure facilities such as weapons laboratories.&lt;ref name="FehlauBrunson1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fehlau |first1=P. E. |last2=Brunson |first2=G. S. |title=Coping with Plastic Scintillators in Nuclear Safeguards |journal=IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science |volume=30 |issue=1 |year=1983 |pages=158–161 |issn=0018-9499 |doi=10.1109/TNS.1983.4332242|bibcode = 1983ITNS...30..158F }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were deployed at scrap metal facilities to detect radiation sources mixed among scrap that could contaminate a facility and result in a costly clean up. {{Citation needed|reason=it is unclear what technology in the RPM - either gamma ray detectors or neutron detectors, were made for the scrap metal industry prior to using the technology in portal monitors.  Also, it is unclear to what level and scalability the technology was developed to before RPM use.  A source for this statement is therefore needed|date=April 2013}} As part of the effort to thwart nuclear smuggling after the breakup of the Soviet Union, RPMs were deployed around that territory, and later around many other European and Asian countries,  by the US Department of Energy (DOE) [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] (NNSA) Second Line of Defense Program (SLD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/nonproliferation/programoffices/internationalmaterialprotectionandcooperation/se Second Line of Defense Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112013541/http://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/nonproliferation/programoffices/internationalmaterialprotectionandcooperation/se |date=2011-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the late 1990s. After the attack of 9/11, the [[US Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) started the Radiation Portal Monitor Program (RPMP) to deploy RPMs around all US borders (land, sea and air).&lt;ref&gt;Kouzes, R.T., "Detecting Illicit Nuclear Materials", American Scientist 93, PP. 422-427 (September–October 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detected radiation==

Radiation Portal Monitor (RPM) was designed to detect traces of radiation emitted from an object passing through a RPM. Gamma radiation is detected, and in some cases complemented by neutron detection when sensitivity for nuclear material is desired.&lt;ref name="KouzesSiciliano2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kouzes |first1=Richard T. |last2=Siciliano |first2=Edward R. |last3=Ely |first3=James H. |last4=Keller |first4=Paul E. |last5=McConn |first5=Ronald J. |title=Passive neutron detection for interdiction of nuclear material at borders |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |volume=584 |issue=2-3 |year=2008 |pages=383–400 |issn=0168-9002 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2007.10.026|bibcode = 2008NIMPA.584..383K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===PVT (gamma ray detection)===
First generation RPMs often rely on [[polyvinyl toluene|PVT]] scintillators for gamma counting. They provide limited information on energy of detected photons, and as a result, they were criticized for their inability to distinguish gamma rays originating from nuclear sources from gamma rays originating from a large variety of benign cargo types that naturally emit radioactivity, including [[cat litter]], [[granite]], [[porcelain]], [[stoneware]], [[banana]] etc.&lt;ref name=hor&gt;{{cite book
  | title =Waste, Abuse, and Mismanagement in Department of Homeland Security Contracts
  | publisher =[[United States House of Representatives]]
  | date =July 2006
  | pages =12–13
  | url =http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20060727092939-29369.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those [[Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material]]s, called NORMs account for 99% of nuisance alarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url=http://www.ludlums.com/manuals/M3500-1000mar06.pdf
  | accessdate = Sep 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth noting that bananas have erroneously been reported as the source of radiation alarms; they are not. Most produce contains potassium-40, but packing density of fruits and vegetables is too low to produce a significant signal. PVT does have the ability to provide some energy discrimination, which can be exploited to limit nuisance alarms from NORM.&lt;ref name="ElyKouzes2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ely |first1=James |last2=Kouzes |first2=Richard |last3=Schweppe |first3=John |last4=Siciliano |first4=Edward |last5=Strachan |first5=Denis |last6=Weier |first6=Dennis |title=The use of energy windowing to discriminate SNM from NORM in radiation portal monitors |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |volume=560 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=373–387 |issn=0168-9002 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2006.01.053|bibcode = 2006NIMPA.560..373E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NaI(Tl) (gamma ray detection)===
In attempt to reduce the high nuisance alarm rates of first generation RPMs, the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) program was called into life. Some of the portal monitors evaluated for this purposes are based on [[Sodium iodide|NaI(Tl)]] scintillating crystals. These devices, having better energy resolution than PVT, were supposed to reduce nuisance alarm rates by distinguishing threats from benign sources on the basis of the detected gamma radiation spectra. ASPs based on NaI(Tl) had a cost several times that of first generation RPMs. To date, NaI(Tl) based ASPs have not been able to demonstrate significantly better performance than PVT based RPMs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12699&amp;page=R1 "Evaluating testing, costs, and benefits of advanced spectroscopic portals for screening cargo at ports of entry: interim report" (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASP program was canceled in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matishak|first1=Martin|title=Homeland Security Cancels Troubled Radiation Detector Effort|url=http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/homeland-security-cancels-troubled-radiation-detector-effort/|accessdate=6 July 2015|agency=Global Security Newswire|date=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; after continued problems, including a high rate of false positives and difficulty maintaining stable operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combating Nuclear Smuggling: Lessons Learned from Cancelled Radiation Portal Monitor Program Could Help Future Acquisitions|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-256|website=GAO-13-256|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HPGe (gamma ray detection)===
In the scope of the ASP program, high purity germanium (HPGe) based portal monitors were evaluated. HPGe, having significantly better energy resolution than NaI(Tl), allows rather precise measurement of the isotopes contributing to gamma ray spectra. However, due to very high costs and major constraints such as cryo-cooling requirements, US government support for HPGe based portal monitors was dropped.

=== &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He (thermal neutron detection)===
RPMs geared for interception of nuclear threats usually incorporate a neutron detection technology.  The vast majority of all neutron detectors deployed in RPMs to date relies on [[Helium-3|He-3]] tubes surrounded by [[neutron moderator]]s.  Since the end of 2009, however, the global He-3 supply crisis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/23/us/23helium.html |title=Shortage Slows a Program to Detect Nuclear Bombs |author=Matthew L. Wald |newspaper=New York Times |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made this technology unavailable.  The search for alternative neutron detection technologies has yielded satisfactory results.&lt;ref&gt;Kouzes, R.T., J.H. Ely, L.E. Erikson, W.J. Kernan, A.T. Lintereur, E.R. Siciliano, D.L. Stephens, D.C. Stromswold, R.M. VanGinhoven, M.L. Woodring, Neutron Detection Alternatives For Homeland Security, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A 623 (2010) 1035–1045&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He (fast neutron detection) ===
The latest technology being deployed at ports&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://174.128.194.76/news/detectors-antwerp-gets415358.aspx|title=Port of Antwerp Gets Nuke Detectors|last=|first=|date=|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325025635/http://174.128.194.76/news/detectors%2Dantwerp%2Dgets415358.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses pressurized natural helium to directly detect fast neutrons, without the need for bulky [[neutron moderator]]s. Utilizing recoil nuclei following neutron scatter events, natural helium glows (scintillates), allowing photomultipliers (e.g. SiPMs) to produce an electrical signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=J.M.|last2=R. P. Kelley|last3=D. Murer|last4=K. A. Jordan|year=2014|title=Fission signal detection using helium-4 gas fast neutron scintillation detectors|url=|journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|volume=105|pages=014102|bibcode=2014ApPhL.105a4102L|doi=10.1063/1.4887366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing moderators and lithium-6 to capture thermalized neutrons further increases the detection capabilities of natural helium, at the expense of losing the initial information of the neutrons (such as energy) and reducing sensitivity to shielded neutron-emitting materials.

==Radiological threats==
RPMs are deployed with the aim to intercept radiological threats as well as to deter malicious groups from deploying such threats.

===Radiological dispersal devices===
[[radiological weapon|Radiological dispersal devices]] (RDDs) are weapons of mass disruption rather than weapons of mass destruction. "[[Dirty bomb]]s" are examples of RDDs. As the name suggests, an RDD aims at dispersing radioactive material over an area, causing high cleanup costs, psychological, and economic damage. Nevertheless, direct human losses caused by RDDs are low and not attributed to the radiological aspect. RDDs are easily fabricated and components readily obtainable. RDDs are comparatively easy to detect with RPMs due to their high level of radioactivity. RDDs  emit gamma radiation as well as sometimes, depending on what isotopes are used, neutrons.

===Nuclear devices===
Improvised nuclear devices (INDs) and [[nuclear weapons]] are weapons of mass destruction. They are difficult to acquire, manufacture, refurbish, and handle. While INDs can be constructed to emit only low amounts of radiation making them difficult to detect with RPMs, all INDs emit some amounts of gamma and neutron radiation.

==Alarms==
Gamma radiation as well as neutron radiation can cause RPMs to trigger an alarm procedure. Alarms caused by statistical fluctuations of detection rates are referred to as false alarms. Alarms caused by benign radioactive sources are referred to as nuisance alarms. Causes of nuisance alarms can be broken up into several large categories:

==Deployment==
This article relates primarily to RPMs deployed for screening trucks at ports of entry. Over 1400 RPMs are deployed at US borders and a similar number at foreign locations for the purpose of interdicting illicit radiological and nuclear material. The US deployments cover all land border vehicles, all seaport containerized cargo, and all mail and express courier facilities. Efforts are also being made to deploy similar measures to other cross border vectors including:
* Pedestrian radiation portal monitoring
* Air freight radiation portal monitoring
* Crane based radiation portal monitoring
* Air luggage radiation portal monitoring
* Railway radiation portal monitoring

RPMs are also deployed at civilian and military nuclear facilities to prevent theft of radiological materials. Steel mills often use RPMs to screen incoming scrap metal to avoid radioactive sources illegally disposed in this way. Garbage incineration plants often monitor incoming material to avoid contamination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9783">'''Rangeland management''' (also '''range management''', '''range science''', or '''arid-land management''') is a professional [[natural science]] that centers around the study of [[rangeland]]s and the "conservation and sustainable management [of Arid-Lands] for the benefit of current societies and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangelands.org/ Society for range Management. Society for Range Management, 2016. Web. 22 Apr. 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; Range management is defined by Holechek et al. as the "manipulation of rangeland components to obtain optimum combination of [[Ecosystem services|goods and services]] for society on a sustained basis."&lt;ref&gt;Holechek, Jerry L., Rex D. Pieper, and Carlton H. Herbel. Range Management: Principles and Practices (6th Edition). 6th ed. N.p.: Pearson, 2011. 5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest form of Rangeland Management is not formally deemed part of the natural science studied today, although its roots can be traced to [[Nomad|nomadic grazing]] practices of the [[neolithic agricultural revolution]] when humans [[Domestication|domesticated]] plants and animals under pressures from population growth and environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Ecological History of Agriculture 10,000 B.C.-A.D. 10,000|last=Vasey|first=Daniel A.|publisher=Iowa State University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Ames, Iowa|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans might even have altered the environment in times preceding the  [[Neolithic]] through hunting of [[Big-game hunting|large-game]], whereby large losses of [[Grazing|grazing herbivores]] could have resulted in altered ecological states; meaning humans have been inadvertently managing land throughout prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Wroe , Judith Field , Richard Fullagar , Lars S. Jermin. "Megafaunal extinction in the late Quaternary and the global overkill hypothesis." ''Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.'' Vol. 28, Iss. 1, (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazoyer, Marcel, and Laurence Roudart. ''A History of World Agriculture: From the Neolithic Age to the Current Crisis''. New York: Monthly review Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rangeland management was developed in the United States in response to rangeland deterioration and in some cases, [[denudation]], due to [[overgrazing]] and other misuse of arid lands, as was described by [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin]]’s 1968 "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" and evidenced previously by the 20th century "[[Dust Bowl]]".&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Melvin S. "History of Range Management Education." Rangelands 3.3 (1981): 119-20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, M W., and F P. Cronemiller. "Some of the Beginnings of Range Management." Journal of Range Management 14.2 (1961): 95-102. Print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathan F. Sayre, William deBuys, Brandon T. Bestelmeyer, and Kris M. Havstad. "’The Range  Problem’ After a Century of Rangeland Science: New Research Themes for Altered  Landscapes." Rangeland Ecol Manage 545-552: 65 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the discipline focused on the manipulation of [[grazing]] and the proper use of rangeland vegetation for [[livestock]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Kenneth W., W R. Chapline, Lloyd W. Swift, George W. Craddock, and Donald R. Cornelius. "Arthur W. Sampson- Pioneer Range Scientist." Journal of Range Management 20.6 (1967): 245-351. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern application==
Today, range management's focus has been expanded to include the host of [[ecosystem services]] that rangelands provide to humans world-wide. Key management components seek to optimize such goods and services through the protection and enhancement of [[soils]], [[riparian zones]], [[Drainage basin|watersheds]], and vegetation complexes, [[sustainably]] improving outputs of consumable range products such as [[red meat]], [[wildlife]], water, wood, [[fiber]], [[leather]], energy resource extraction, and [[outdoor recreation]], as well as maintaining a focus on the [[Grazing management|manipulation of grazing]] activities of large herbivores to maintain or improve animal and plant production.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Herrick, J.R. Brown, B.T. Bestelmeyer, S.S. Andrews, G. Baldi, J. Davies, M. Duniway, K.M.  Havstad, J.W. Karl, D.L. Karlen, D.P.C. Peters, J.N. Quinton, C. Riginos, P.L. Shaver, D. Stainaker, S. Twomlow. “Revolutionary Land Use Change in the 21st Century: Is (Rangeland) Science Relevant? Rangeland Ecol Manage 590-598: 65 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society for Range Management [http://www.rangelands.org/] is "the professional society dedicated to supporting persons who work with rangelands and have a commitment to their sustainable use." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rangelands.org/|title=Society for Range Management|website=www.rangelands.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary Rangeland Management publications include the ''Journal of Range Management'', ''Rangelands'', and ''Rangeland Ecology &amp; Management''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rangelands.org/publications.shtml|title=Publications|website=www.rangelands.org|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pastoralism]] has become a contemporary anthropological and ecological study as it faces many threats including fragmentation of land, conversion of rangeland into urban development, lack of grazing movement, impending threats on global diversity, damage to species with large terrain, decreases in shared public goods, decreased [[Animal migration|biological movements]], threats of a "tragedy of enclosures", limitation of key resources, reduced biomass and invasive plant species growth.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Robin S.; Fernández-Giménes, María E.; Galvin, Kathleen A. “Dynamics and Resilience of Rangelands and Pastoral Peoples Around the Globe.” ''Annu. Rev. Environ. Resource''. 39:217-249 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in contemporary pastoralist cultures like the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] has continued to increase, especially because the traditional syncreticly-adaptive ability of pastoralists could promise lessons in collaborative and [[adaptive management]] for contemporary pastoralist societies threatened by [[globalization]] as well as for contemporary non-pastoralist societies that are managing livestock on rangelands.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Robin S.; Fernández-Giménes, María E.; Galvin, Kathleen A. “Dynamics and Resilience of Rangelands and Pastoral Peoples Around the Globe.” ''Annu. Rev. Environ. Resource''. 39:217-249 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briske, D.D.; Sayre, Nathan F.; Huntsoinger; Fernandez-Gimenez, M.; Budd, B.; Derner, J.D. “Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate: Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland research.” ''Rangeland Ecol Manage''. 64(4): 325-334 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and employment==
In the United States, the study of range science is commonly offered at [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] including [[New Mexico State University]], [[Colorado State University]], [[Oregon State University]], [[South Dakota State University]], [[Texas A&amp;M University]], [[Texas Tech University]], the [[University of Arizona]], the [[University of Idaho]], the [[University of Wyoming]], [[Utah State University]], and [[Montana State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rangelands.org/education_universities.shtml Society for Range Management. Society for Range Management Universities and Colleges, 2016. Web. 22 Apr. 2016. ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Range Science curriculum is strongly tied to [[animal science]], as well as [[plant ecology]], [[soil science]], [[wildlife management]], [[climatology]] and [[anthropology]]. Courses in a typical Range Science curriculum may include [[ethology]], range [[animal nutrition]], [[plant physiology]], [[plant ecology]], [[plant identification]], [[plant communities]], [[microbiology]], [[soil sciences]], [[fire control]], [[agricultural economics]], [[Wildlife management|wildlife ecology]], [[ranch management]], [[Socioeconomics]], [[cartography]], [[hydrology]], [[Ecophysiology]], and [[environmental policy]]. These courses are essential to entering a range science profession.

Students with degrees in range science are eligible for a host of technician-type careers working for the federal government under the [[Bureau of Land Management]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], the [[Agricultural Research Service]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]], or the [[US Forest Service]] as range conservationists, inventory technicians, range monitoring/animal science agents, field botanists, natural-resource technicians, vegetation/habitat monitors, [[Geographic information system|GIS]] programming assistants, general range technicians, and as [[Ecological technology|ecological]] assessors, as well as working in the private sector as range managers, [[Rancher|ranch managers]], producers, commercial consultants, mining and agricultural real estate agents, or as Range/ Ranch Consultants. Individuals who complete degrees at the [[Master's degree|M.S.]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy|P.h.D.]] level, can seek academic careers as [[professor]]s, [[Agricultural extension|extension specialists]], research assistants, and [[Adjunct professor|adjunct]] staff, in addition to a number of professional research positions for government agencies such as the [[US Department of Agriculture]] and other state run departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rangelands.org/jobs/listings.html#free Society for Range Management.

Notice the young cottonwood and sycamore trees at the left.]]
'''Riparian-zone restoration''' is the [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] of '''[[riparian zone|riparian-zone]]''' '''[[habitat]]s''' of streams, rivers, [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, lakes, [[floodplain]]s, and other [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] ecologies. A '''riparian zone''' or '''riparian area''' is the interface between land and a [[river]] or [[stream]]. ''Riparian'' is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen  terrestrial [[biome]]s of the earth; the habitats of plant and animal communities along the margins and [[Bank (geography)|river banks]] are called riparian vegetation, characterized by [[Aquatic plants]] and animals that favor them. Riparian zones are significant in [[ecology]], [[environmental management]], and [[civil engineering]] because of their role in [[soil conservation]], their [[habitat]] [[biodiversity]], and the influence they have on [[fauna]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, including [[grassland]], [[woodland]], [[wetland]] or sub-surface features such as [[water table]]s.  In some regions the terms ''riparian woodland'', ''[[riparian forest]]'', ''riparian buffer zone,'' or ''riparian strip'' are used to characterize a riparian zone.

The perceived need for '''Riparian-zone restoration''' has come about because riparian zones have been altered and/or degraded throughout much of the world&lt;ref name=Richardson2007&gt;{{harvnb|Richardson|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the activities of mankind affecting natural geologic forces. The unique [[biodiversity]] of riparian [[ecosystem]]s and the potential benefits that natural, vegetated riprarian have to offer in preventing [[erosion]], maintaining water quality that ranges from being decent to completely healthy, providing habitat and [[wildlife corridor]]s, and maintaining the health of in-stream [[biota (ecology)|biota]] ([[:Category:Aquatic organisms|Aquatic organisms]]) has led to a surge of restoration activities aimed at riparian ecosystems in the last few decades.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|Hawkins|Kershner|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Restoration efforts are typically guided by an ecological understanding of riparian-zone processes and knowledge of the causes of degradation.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; They are often interdependent with [[stream restoration]] projects.

== Causes of riparian-zone degradation ==
Riparian-zone [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] falls into two main categories: hydrologic modifications that indirectly impact riparian communities through changes in [[Channel types|stream morphology]] and hydrologic processes, and habitat alterations that result in direct modification of riparian communities through land clearing or disturbance.

=== Hydrologic modifications ===

==== Dams and diversions ====
{{see also|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
Dams are built on rivers primarily to store water for human use, generate hydroelectric power, and/or control flooding. Natural riparian ecosystems upstream of dams can be destroyed when newly created reservoirs inundate riparian habitat. Dams can also cause substantial changes in downstream riparian communities by altering the magnitude, frequency, and timing of flood events and reducing the amount of sediment and nutrients delivered from upstream.&lt;ref name=MerrittCooper2000&gt;{{harvnb|Merritt|Cooper|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993&gt;{{harvnb|Stromberg|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diverting water from stream channels for agricultural, industrial, and human use reduces the volume of water flowing downstream, and can have similar effects.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

In a natural riparian system, periodic flooding can remove sections of riparian vegetation. This leaves portions of the floodplain available for regeneration and effectively “resets” the successional timeline.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Frequent disturbance naturally favors many early-successional (pioneer) riparian species.&lt;ref name=AzamiSuzukiToki2004&gt;{{harvnb|Azami|Suzuki|Toki|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies show that a reduction in flooding due to dams and diversions can allow community succession to progress beyond a typical stage, causing changes in community structure.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=AzamiSuzukiToki2004 /&gt;

Changing flood regimes can be especially problematic when exotic species are favored by altered conditions. For example, dam regulation changes floodplain [[hydrology]] in the southwest US by impeding annual flooding cycles. This modification has been implicated in the dominance of saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis) over the native cottonwood (Populus deltoids). Cottonwoods were found to be competitively superior to saltcedar when flooding allowed seeds of both species to cogerminate. However, the lack of flooding caused by altered hydrology creates more favorable conditions for the germination of saltcedar over cottonwoods.&lt;ref name=Bhattacharjee2009&gt;{{harvnb|Bhattacharjee|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Groundwater withdrawals ====
Riparian zones are characterized by a distinct community of plant species that are physiologically adapted to a greater amount of freshwater than upland species.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; In addition to having frequent direct contact with surface water through periodic rises in stream water levels and flooding, riparian zones are also characterized by their proximity to [[groundwater]]. Particularly in arid regions, shallow groundwater, [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], and springs provides a more constant source of water to riparian vegetation than occasional flooding.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; By reducing the availability of water, groundwater withdrawals can impact the health of riparian vegetation.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=StombergTillerRichter1996&gt;{{harvnb|Stomberg|Tiller|Richter|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Populus fremontii|Fremont cottonwood]] (''Populus fremontii''), and [[Salix gooddingii|San Joaquin willow]] (''Salix gooddingii''), common riparian species in Arizona, were found to have more dead branches and experienced greater mortality with decreasing groundwater levels.&lt;ref name=HortonKolbHart2001&gt;{{harvnb|Horton|Kolb|Hart|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant community composition can change dramatically over a gradient of groundwater depth: plants that can only survive in wetland conditions can be replaced by plants that are tolerant of drier conditions as groundwater levels are reduced, causing habitat community shifts and in some cases complete loss of riparian species.&lt;ref name=StombergTillerRichter1996 /&gt; Studies have also shown that decreases in groundwater levels may favor the invasion and persistence of certain exotic [[invasive species]] such as [[Tamarix chinensis|Saltcedar]] (''Tamarix chinensis''), which do not appear to show the same degree of physiologic water stress as native species when subjected to lower groundwater levels.&lt;ref name=HortonKolbHart2001 /&gt;

==== Stream channelization and levee construction ====
Stream [[River engineering#Channelization|channelization]] is the process of engineering straighter, wider, and deeper stream channels, usually for improved navigation, wetland drainage, and/or faster transport of flood waters downstream.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; [[Levee]]s are often constructed in conjunction with channelization to protect human development and agricultural fields from flooding.&lt;ref name=Franklin2009&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riparian vegetation can be directly removed or damaged during and after the channelization process.&lt;ref name=Hupp1992&gt;{{harvnb|Hupp|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, channelization and levee construction modify the natural hydrology of a stream system.&lt;ref name=Franklin2009 /&gt; As water flows through a natural stream, meanders are created when faster flowing water erodes outer banks and slower flowing water deposits sediment on inner banks. Many riparian plant species depend on these areas of new sediment deposition for germination and establishment of seedlings.&lt;ref name=ScottFriedmanAuble1996&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|Friedman|Auble|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel straightening and levee construction eliminate these areas of deposition, creating unfavorable conditions for riparian vegetation recruitment.

By preventing overbank flooding, levees reduce the amount of water available to riparian vegetation in the floodplain, which alters the types of vegetation that can persist in these conditions.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; A lack of flooding has been shown to decrease the amount of habitat heterogeneity in riparian ecosystems as wetland depressions in the floodplain no longer fill and hold water.&lt;ref name=Franklin2009 /&gt; Because habitat heterogeneity is correlated with species diversity, levees can cause reductions in the overall biodiversity of riparian ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Franklin2009 /&gt;

=== Habitat alteration ===

==== Land clearing ====
In many places around the world, vegetation within  riparian zones have been completely removed as humans have [[Deforestation|cleared land]] for raising crops, growing timber, and developing land for commercial or residential purposes.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; Removing riparian vegetation increases the erodibility of stream banks, and can also speed the rate of channel migration (unless the newly cleared banks are lined with riprap, retaining walls, or concrete).&lt;ref name=MicheliKirchnerLarsen2004&gt;{{harvnb|Micheli|Kirchner|Larsen|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, removal of riparian vegetation fragments the remaining riparian ecosystem, which can prevent or hinder dispersal of species between habitat patches.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; This can diminish riparian plant diversity, as well as decrease abundances and diversity of migratory birds or other species that depend on large, undisturbed areas of habitat.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Fragmentation can also prevent gene flow between isolated riparian patches, reducing genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

==== Livestock grazing ====
{{see also|Noxious weed}}
[[Cattle]] have a propensity to aggregate around water, which can be detrimental to riparian ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; While native [[ungulate]]s such as deer are commonly found in riparian zones, [[livestock]] may trample or graze down [[native plant]]s, creating an unnatural amount and type of disturbance that riparian species have not evolved to tolerate.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarr2002&gt;{{harvnb|Sarr|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock [[grazing]] has been shown to reduce areal cover of native plant species, create disturbance frequencies that favor exotic annual weeds, and alter plant community composition. For example, in an arid South African ecosystem, grazing was found to cause a reduction of grasses, sedges, and tree species and an increase in non-succulent shrubs.&lt;ref name=Allsopp2007&gt;{{harvnb|Allsopp|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mining ====
{{see also|Environmental impact of mining}}
Mining stream channels for sand and gravel can impact riparian zones by destroying habitat directly, removing groundwater through pumping, altering stream channel morphology, and changing sediment flow regimes.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Conversely, mining activities in the floodplain can create favorable areas for the establishment of riparian vegetation (e.g., cottonwoods) along streams where natural recruitment processes have been impacted through other forms of human activity.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Mining for metals can impact riparian zones when toxic materials accumulate in sediments.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

==== Invasive exotics ====
The number and diversity of invasive [[Introduced species|exotic species]] in riparian ecosystems is increasing worldwide.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Riparian zones may be particularly vulnerable to invasion due to frequent habitat disturbance (both natural and anthropogenic) and the efficiency of rivers and streams in dispersing propagules.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Invasive species can greatly impact the ecosystem structure and function of riparian zones. For example, the higher biomass of dense stands of the invasive Acacia mearnsii and Eucalyptus species causes greater water consumption and thus lower water levels in streams in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Invasive plants can also cause changes in the amount of sediment that is trapped by vegetation, altering channel morphology, and can increase the flammability of the vegetation, increasing fire frequency.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Exotic animals can also impact riparian zones. For example, feral burros along the [[Santa Maria River (Arizona)|Santa Maria river]] strip bark and cambium off native cottonwoods, causing tree mortality.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

== Methods ==
Methods for restoring riparian zones are often determined by the cause of degradation. Two main approaches are used in riparian-zone restoration: restoring hydrologic processes and geomorphic features, and reestablishing native riparian vegetation.

=== Restoring hydrologic processes and geomorphic features ===

When altered flow regimes have impacted riparian zone health, re-establishing natural streamflow may be the best solution to effectively restore riparian ecosystems.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; The complete removal of dams and flow-altering structures may be required to fully restore historic conditions, but this is not always realistic or feasible. An alternative to dam removal is for periodic flood pulses consistent with historical magnitude and timing to be simulated by releasing large amounts of water at once instead of maintaining more consistent flows throughout the year. This would allow overbank flooding, which is vital for maintaining the health of many riparian ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Bhattacharjee2009 /&gt; However, simply restoring a more natural flow regime also has logistical constraints, as legally appropriated water rights may not include the maintenance of such ecologically important factors.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; Reductions in groundwater pumping may also help restore riparian ecosystems by reestablishing groundwater levels that favor riparian vegetation; however, this too can be hampered by the fact that groundwater withdrawal regulations do not usually incorporate provisions for riparian protection.&lt;ref name=StombergTillerRichter1996 /&gt;

The negative effects of channelization on stream and riparian health can be lessened through physical restoration of the stream channel.  This can be accomplished by restoring flow to historic channels, or through the creation of new channels. In order for restoration to be successful, particularly for the creation of entirely new channels, restoration plans must take into account the geomorphic potential of the individual stream and tailor restoration methods accordingly.&lt;ref name=Rosgen1997&gt;{{harvnb|Rosgen|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typically done through examination of reference streams (physically and ecologically similar streams in stable, natural condition) and by methods of stream classification based on morphological features.&lt;ref name=Rosgen1997 /&gt; Stream channels are typically designed to be narrow enough to overflow into the floodplain on a 1.5 to 2 year timescale.&lt;ref name=Rosgen1997 /&gt; The goal of geomorphic restoration is to eventually restore hydrologic processes important to riparian and instream ecosystems. However, this type of restoration can be logistically difficult: in many cases, the initial straightening or modification of the channel has resulted in humans encroaching into the former floodplain through development, agriculture, etc.&lt;ref name=GoodwinHawkinsKershner1997 /&gt; In addition, stream channel modification can be extremely costly.

One well-known example of a large-scale stream restoration project is the [[Restoration of the Everglades#Kissimmee River|Kissimmee River Restoration Project]] in central Florida. The [[Kissimmee River]] was channelized between 1962 and 1971 for [[flood control]], turning a meandering 167&amp;nbsp;km of river into a 90&amp;nbsp;km drainage canal.&lt;ref name=Whalen2002&gt;{{harvnb|Whalen|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively eliminated seasonal inundation of the floodplain, causing a conversion from wetland to upland communities.&lt;ref name=SFWMD2006&gt;{{harvnb|SFWMD|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A restoration plan began in 1999 with the goals of reestablishing ecological integrity of the river-floodplain system.&lt;ref name=SFWMD2006 /&gt; The project involves dechannelizing major sections of the river, directing water into reconstructed channels, removing water control structures, and changing flow regimes to restore seasonal flooding to the floodplain.&lt;ref name=Whalen2002 /&gt; Since the completion of the first phase of restoration, a number of improvements in vegetation and wildlife communities have been documented as the conversion from uplands back to wetlands has begun to take place.&lt;ref name=SFWMD2009&gt;{{harvnb|SFWMD|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Breaching levees to reconnect streams to their floodplains can be an effective form of restoration as well.  On the [[Cosumnes River]] in central California, for example, the return of seasonal flooding to the floodplain as a result of levee breaching was found to result in the reestablishment of primarily native riparian plant communities.&lt;ref name=Trowbridge2007&gt;{{harvnb|Trowbridge|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dechannelisation of shorter reach (2&amp;nbsp;km long) and lowered levee are also been proved to be an effective restoration approach together with natural (or near natural) flooding regime in order to improve soil processes spatial and temporal heterogeneity typical of natural floodplains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Samaritani|first1=Emanuela|last2=Shrestha|first2= Juna|last3=Fournier|first3=Bertrand|last4=Frossard|first4=Emmanuel|last5=Gillet|first5=François|last6=Guenat|first6=Claire|last7=Niklaus|first7=Pascal A.|last8=Pasquale|first8=Nicola|last9=Tockner|first9=Klement|last10=Mitchell|first10=Edward A.D.|last11=Luster|first11=Jörg|title=Heterogeneity of soil carbon pools and fluxes in a channelized and a restored floodplain section (Thur River, Switzerland)|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|year=2011|volume=15|pages=1757–1769|doi=10.5194/hess-15-1757-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream channels will often recover from channelization without human intervention, provided that humans do not continue to maintain or modify the channel. Gradually, channel beds and stream banks will begin to accumulate sediment, meanders will form, and woody vegetation will take hold, stabilizing the banks. However, this process may take decades: a study found stream channel regeneration took approximately 65 years in channelized streams in West Tennessee.&lt;ref name=Hupp1992 /&gt; More active methods of restoration may speed the process along.

=== Restoration of riparian vegetation ===

The revegetation of degraded riparian zones is a common practice in riparian restoration. Revegetation can be accomplished through active or passive means, or a combination of the two.

==== Active vegetation restoration ====
A lack of naturally available propagules can be a major limiting factor in restoration success.&lt;ref name=Young2005&gt;{{harvnb|Young|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, actively planting native vegetation is often crucial for the successful establishment of riparian species.&lt;ref name=YoungChaseHuddleston2001&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Chase|Huddleston|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common methods for actively restoring vegetation include broadcast sowing seed and directly planting seeds, plugs, or seedlings. Reestablishing clonal species such as willows can often be accomplished by simply putting cuttings directly into the ground.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; To increase survival rates, young plants may need to be protected from herbivory with fencing or tree shelters.&lt;ref name=Phillips2007&gt;{{harvnb|Phillips|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preliminary research suggests that direct-seeding woody species may be more cost-effective than planting container stock.&lt;ref name=PalmerleeYoung2010&gt;{{harvnb|Palmerlee|Young|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference sites are often used to determine appropriate species to plant and may be used as sources for seeds or cuttings. Reference communities serve as models for what restoration sites should ideally look like after restoration is complete.&lt;ref name=SER2004&gt;{{harvnb|SER|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about using reference sites have been raised however, as conditions at the restored and reference sites may not be similar enough to support the same species.&lt;ref name=SER2004 /&gt; Also, restored riparian zones may be able to support a variety of possible species combinations, therefore the Society for Ecological Restoration recommends using multiple reference sites to formulate restoration goals.&lt;ref name=SER2004 /&gt;

A practical question in active vegetation restoration is whether certain plants facilitate the recruitment and persistence of other plants (as predicted by theories of succession), or whether initial community composition determines long-term community composition (priority effects).&lt;ref name=Young2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PalmerAmbrosePoff1997&gt;{{harvnb|Palmer|Ambrose|Poff|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the former applies, it may be more effective to plant facilitative species first, and wait to plant dependent species as conditions become appropriate (e.g., when enough shade is provided by overstory species). If the latter applies, it is probably best to plant all desired species at the outset.&lt;ref name=PalmerAmbrosePoff1997 /&gt;

As a critical component of restoring native riparian communities, restoration practitioners often have to remove invasive species and prevent them from reestablishing. This can be accomplished through herbicide application, mechanical removal, etc. When restoration is to be done on long stretches of rivers and streams, it is often useful to begin the project upstream and work downstream so that propagules from exotic species upstream will not hamper restoration attempts.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Ensuring the establishment of native species is considered vital in preventing future colonizations of exotic plants.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt;

==== Passive vegetation restoration ====
Active planting of riparian vegetation may be the fastest way to reestablish riparian ecosystems, but methods may be prohibitively resource-intensive.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Riparian vegetation may come back on its own if human-induced disturbances are stopped and/or hydrologic processes are restored.&lt;ref name=OppermanMerenlender2004&gt;{{harvnb|Opperman|Merenlender|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, many studies show that preventing cattle grazing in riparian zones through exclusion fencing can allow riparian vegetation to rapidly increase in robustness and cover, and also shift to a more natural community composition.&lt;ref name=Sarr2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DobkinRichPyle1998&gt;{{harvnb|Dobkin|Rich|Pyle|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By simply restoring hydrologic processes such as periodic flooding that favor riparian vegetation, native communities may regenerate on their own (e.g., the Cosumnes River floodplain).&lt;ref name=Trowbridge2007 /&gt; The successful recruitment of native species will depend on whether local or upstream seed sources can successfully disperse propagules to the restoration site, or whether a native seed bank is present.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=YoungChaseHuddleston2001 /&gt; One potential hindrance to passive vegetation restoration is that exotic species may preferentially colonize the riparian zone.&lt;ref name=Richardson2007/&gt; Active weeding may improve the chances that the desired native plant community will reestablish.

=== Restoring animal life ===
Restoration often focuses on reestablishing plant communities, probably because plants form the foundation for other organisms within the community.&lt;ref name=Young2005 /&gt; Restoration of faunal communities often follows the “Field of Dreams” hypothesis: “if you build it, they will come”.&lt;ref name=PalmerAmbrosePoff1997 /&gt; Many animal species have been found to naturally recolonize areas where habitat has been restored.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; For example, abundances of several bird species showed marked increases after riparian vegetation had been reestablished in a riparian corridor in Iowa.&lt;ref name=BensonDinsmoreHohman2006&gt;{{harvnb|Benson|Dinsmore|Hohman|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some riparian restoration efforts may be aimed at conserving particular animal species of concern, such as the Valley elderberry longhorn beetle in central California, which is dependent on a riparian tree species (blue elderberry, ''Sambucus mexicana'') as its sole host plant.&lt;ref name=Vaghti2009&gt;{{harvnb|Vaghti|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When restoration efforts target key species, consideration for individual species’ needs (e.g., minimum width or extent of riparian vegetation) are important for ensuring restoration success.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;

=== Ecosystem perspectives ===
Restoration failures may occur when appropriate ecosystem conditions are not reestablished, such as soil characteristics (e.g., salinity, pH, beneficial soil biota, etc.), surface water and groundwater levels, and flow regimes.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt; Therefore, successful restoration may be dependent on taking a number of both biotic and abiotic factors into account. For example, restoration of soil biota, including symbiotic myccorhizae, invertebrates, and microorganisms may improve nutrient cycling dynamics.&lt;ref name=Stromberg1993 /&gt;  Restoration of physical processes may be a prerequisite to the reestablishment of healthy riparian communities.&lt;ref name=Trowbridge2007 /&gt; Ultimately, a combination of approaches taking into account causes for degradation and targeting both hydrology and the reestablishment of vegetation and other life forms may be most effective in riparian zone restoration.

[[File:Estructura-suelo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=This is a diagram and related photograph of soil layers from bedrock to soil.|A represents soil; B represents [[laterite]], a [[regolith]]; C represents saprolite, a less-weathered regolith; beneath C is bedrock.]]

'''Saprolite''' is a chemically [[Weathering|weathered]] rock. Saprolites form in the lower zones of [[soil profile]]s and represent deep weathering of the [[bedrock]] surface. In most outcrops its color comes from [[ferric]] compounds. Deeply weathered profiles are widespread on the continental landmasses between latitudes 35°N and 35°S.

Conditions for the formation of deeply weathered [[regolith]] include a topographically moderate relief flat enough to prevent [[erosion]] and to allow [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of the products of chemical weathering. A second condition is long periods of tectonic stability; tectonic activity and climate change can cause erosion. The third condition is [[tropical climate|humid tropical]] to [[temperate climate]].

Poorly weathered saprolite grit [[aquifer]]s are capable of producing [[groundwater]], often suitable for livestock. Deep weathering causes the formation of many secondary and [[Supergene (geology)|supergene]] [[ore]]s &amp;ndash; [[bauxite]], [[iron ore]]s, saprolitic [[gold]], supergene [[copper]], [[uranium]] and heavy minerals in residual accumulations.&lt;ref name=butt/&gt;

Saprolite (from Greek σαπρος = putrid + λιθος = rock) is a chemically weathered rock (literally, it means "rotten rock"). More intense weathering results in a continuous transition from saprolite to [[laterite]].

[[File:Sif Was Queen of the Fields.jpg|thumb|The goddess Sif holds her long, golden hair while grain grows behind her in an illustration from 1897]]

In [[Norse mythology]], '''Sif''' ({{IPAc-en|s|iː|f}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/sif "Sif"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Ásynjur|goddess]] associated with earth. Sif is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], and in the poetry of [[skald]]s. In both the ''Poetic Edda'' and the ''Prose Edda'', Sif is the wife of the thunder god [[Thor]] and is known for her [[Blond|golden hair]].

In the ''Prose Edda'', Sif is named as the mother of the goddess [[Þrúðr]] by [[Thor]] and of [[Ullr]] with a father whose name is not recorded. The ''Prose Edda'' also recounts that Sif once had her hair [[shorn]] by [[Loki]], and that Thor forced Loki to have a golden headpiece made for Sif, resulting in not only Sif's golden tresses but also five other objects for other gods.

Scholars have proposed that Sif's hair may represent fields of [[wheat|golden wheat]], that she may be associated with fertility, family, wedlock and/or that she is connected to [[rowan]], and that there may be an allusion to her role or possibly her name in the [[Old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]''.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Sif'' is the singular form of the plural [[Old Norse]] word {{wikt-lang|non|sifjar}}. {{lang|non|Sifjar}} only appears in singular form when referring to the goddess as a proper noun. {{lang|non|Sifjar}} is cognate to the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|sibb}} and [[english language|modern English]] {{wikt-lang|en|sib}} (meaning "affinity, connection, by marriage") and in other Germanic languages: [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{wikt-lang|got|𐍃𐌹𐌱𐌾𐌰}} ({{lang|got-Latn|sibja}}), [[Old High German]] {{wikt-lang|goh|sippa}}, and [[german language|modern German]] {{wikt-lang|de|Sippe}}. {{lang|non|Sifjar}} appears not only in ancient poetry and records of law, but also in compounds ({{lang|non|[[wikt:byggja#Old Norse|byggja]] sifjar}} means "to marry").&lt;ref name=VIGFUSSON526&gt;Gudbrandur Vigfusson (1874:526).&lt;/ref&gt; Using this etymology, scholar [[John Lindow]] gives the meanings "in-law-relationship", scholar Andy Orchard provides "relation", and scholar [[Rudolf Simek]] gives "relation by marriage".&lt;ref name=MODERNSCHOLARSETYMOLOGY&gt;Lindow (2001:266), Orchard (1997:138), and Simek (2007:283).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attestations ==

=== Poetic Edda ===

In stanza 48 of the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Hárbarðsljóð]]'', [[List of names of Odin|Hárbarðr]] ([[Odin]], father of Thor, in disguise) meets [[Thor]] at an [[inlet]] of a gulf. The two engage in [[flyting]], and Hárbarðr refuses to [[ferry]] Thor across the bay. Among numerous other insults, Hárbarðr claims that Sif has a lover at home. In response, Thor says that Hárbarðr is speaking carelessly "of what seems worst to me" and also lying.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON75&gt;Larrington (1999:75–76).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lokasenna by Lorenz Frølich.jpg|thumb|''Lokasenna'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]

In stanzas 53 and 54 of the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', after pouring Loki a crystal cup of [[mead]] during his series of insults towards the gods, Sif states that there is nothing Loki can say only in regard to her. In response, [[Loki]] claims that Sif has had an affair with him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

: ''Then Sif went forward and poured out mead for Loki into a crystal cup and said:''
:: Welcome now, Loki, and take the crystal cup
:: full of ancient mead,
:: you should admit, that of the children of the [[Æsir]],
:: that I alone am blameless.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

: ''He took the horn and drank it down:
:: That indeed you would be, if you were so,
:: if you were shy and fierce towards men;
:: I alone know, as I think I do now,
:: your lover beside Thor,
:: and that was the wicked Loki.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON93&gt;Larrington (1999:93).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sif does not respond, and the exchange turns to [[Beyla]].&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON94&gt;Larrington (1999:94).&lt;/ref&gt; Sif is additionally mentioned in two kennings found in poems collected in the ''Poetic Edda''; ''[[Hymiskviða]]'' (where Thor is referred to as the "Husband of Sif" thrice&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON78-80-82&gt;Larrington (1999:78, 80, and 82.).&lt;/ref&gt;), and ''[[Þrymskviða]]'' (where Thor is once referred to as "Husband of Sif"&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON100&gt;Larrington (1999:100).&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Prose Edda ===

[[File:How loki wrought mischief in Asgard by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|''How Loki wrought mischief on Asgard'' (1920) by [[Willy Pogany]]]]

[[File:The third gift — an enormous hammer by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''The third gift&amp;nbsp;– an enormous hammer'' (1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]. The bottom right corner depicts the ship [[Skíðblaðnir]] "afloat" Sif's new hair.]]

In the ''Prose Edda'', Sif is mentioned once in the [[Prologue (Prose Edda)|Prologue]], in chapter 31 of ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', and in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' as a guest at [[Ægir]]'s feast, the subject of a jötunn's desire, as having her hair shorn by Loki, and in various kennings.

Sif is introduced in chapter three of the [[Prologue (Prose Edda)|Prologue section]] of the ''Prose Edda''; Snorri's euhemerized account of the origins of [[Viking mythology]]. Snorri states that Thor married Sif, and that she is known as "a prophetess called [[Sibyl]], though we know her as Sif".&lt;ref name=BYOCK6&gt;Byock (2006:6).&lt;/ref&gt; Sif is further described as "the most loveliest of women" and with hair of gold.&lt;ref name=BYOCK6&gt;Byock (2006:6).&lt;/ref&gt; Although he lists her own ancestors as unknown, Snorri writes that Thor and Sif produced a son by the name of [[Lóriði]], who "took after his father".&lt;ref name=FAULKES3&gt;Faulkes (1995:3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 31 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''Gylfaginning'', Ullr is referred to as a son of Sif and a stepson of Thor (though his father is not mentioned):
&lt;blockquote&gt;

: Ull is the name of one. The son of Sif, he is the stepson of Thor. He is so skillful a bowman and skier that no one can compete with him. He is beautiful to look at, and is an accomplished warrior. He is also a good person to pray to when in single combat.&lt;ref name=BYOCK38&gt;Byock (2006:38).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As reported in the ''Prose Edda'' book ''Skáldskaparmál'', Thor once engages in a duel with [[Hrungnir]], there described as the strongest of the [[jötunn|jötnar]]. Prior to this, Hrungnir had been drunkenly boasting of his desire to, amongst other things, kill all of the gods except [[Freyja]] and Sif, whom he wanted to take home with him. However, at the duel, Hrungnir is quickly killed by the enraged Thor.&lt;ref name=FAULKES77-79&gt;Faulkes (1995:77–79).&lt;/ref&gt;

Further in ''Skáldskaparmál'', Snorri relates a story where Loki cuts off Sif's hair as a prank. When Thor discovers this, he grabs hold of Loki, resulting in Loki swearing to have a headpiece made of gold to replace Sif's locks. Loki fulfills this promise by having a headpiece made by [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]], the [[Sons of Ivaldi]]. Along with the headpiece, the dwarfs produced Odin's spear, [[Gungnir]]. As the story progresses, the incident leads to the creation of the ship [[Skíðblaðnir]] and the boar [[Gullinbursti]] for [[Freyr]], the multiplying ring [[Draupnir]] for Odin, and the mighty hammer [[Mjöllnir]] for Thor.&lt;ref name=FAULKES96-97&gt;Faulkes (1995:96–97).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sif also appears in ''Skáldskaparmál'' listed as a [[heiti]] for "earth",&lt;ref name=FAULKES160&gt;Faulkes (1995:163).&lt;/ref&gt; appears in a kenning for a gold-keeping woman,&lt;ref name=FAULKES115&gt;Faulkes (1995:115).&lt;/ref&gt; and once for [[Hildr]].&lt;ref name=FAULKES123&gt;Faulkes (1995:123).&lt;/ref&gt; Poetic means of referring to Sif calling her "wife of Thor", "mother of Ullr", "the fair-haired deity", "rival of [[Járnsaxa]]", and as "mother of Þrúðr".&lt;ref name=FAULKES86&gt;Faulkes (1995:86).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Swedish folklore ===

19th-century scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] records that in his time residents of [[Värmland]], [[Sweden]] "call[ed] Thor's wife ''godmor'', good mother."&lt;ref name=GRIMM1364&gt;Grimm (1888:1364).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==

[[File:Sif by Dollman.jpg|thumb|''Sif'' (1909) by [[John Charles Dollman]]]]

=== ''Beowulf'' ===

In [[Old English]], ''sib'' ("family") is cognate with Old Norse ''Sif'' and ''sif''. In the Old English poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' (lines 2016 to 2018), [[Hroðgar]]'s wife, [[Wealhþeow]], moves through the hall serving mead to the warriors and defusing conflict. Various scholars beginning with [[Magnus Olsen]] have pointed to the similarity with what Sif does at the feast described in ''[[Lokasenna]]''.&lt;ref name="BAKER153"&gt;Baker (1994:153, n. 72)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENRIGHT15"&gt;Enright (1996:15).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard S. North|Richard North]] further notes that unusually, ''sib'' is personified here and in lines 2599 to 2661, and suggests they may be references to Sif in Danish religion: "Both instances may indicate that the poet of ''Beowulf'' was in a position to imagine a sixth-century Scandinavia on the basis of his knowledge of contemporary Danish legends."&lt;ref name="NORTH235-236"&gt;North (1998:235–236, n. 126).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hair as wheat and potential cognates ===

19th-century scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] proposes a reconstruction of a Germanic deity cognate to Sif in other Germanic cultures, and proposes a similar nature to that of the goddesses [[Frigg]] and [[Freyja]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[Gothic language|Goth.]] {{lang|got-Latn|sibja}}, [[Old High German|OHG]]. {{lang|goh|sippia}}, {{lang|goh|sippa}}, [[Old English|AS]]. {{lang|ang|sib}} [[genitive case|gen]]. {{lang|ang|sibbe}}, denote peace, friendship, kindred; from these I infer a divinity ''Sibja'', ''Sippia'', ''Sib'', corresponding to [[Old Norse|ON]]. {{lang|non|Sif}} gen. {{lang|non|Sifjar}}, the wife of [[Thor|Thôrr]], for the ON. too has a pl. {{lang|non|sifjar}} meaning cognatio, sifi amicus (OHG. {{lang|goh|sippio}}, {{lang|goh|sippo}}), sift genus, cognatio. By this sense of the word, ''Sif'' would appear to be, like [[Frigg]] and [[Freyja]], a goddess of loveliness and love; as attributes of [[Odin|Oðinn]] and Thôrr agree, their wives Frigg and Sif have also a common signification.&lt;ref name=GRIMM309&gt;Grimm (1882:309).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Grimm connects Eddic references to Sif's golden hair (gold is referred to as {{lang|non|Sifjar haddr}}; Sif's hair) with the herb name {{lang|non|haddr Sifjar}} (''[[Polytrichum aureum]]''){{check|date=June 2018}}&lt;!-- probably Polytrichum commune ("golden maidenhair moss" etc), but "P. aureum" is not a valid scientific name as per http://www.theplantlist.org/1.1/browse/B/Polytrichaceae/Polytrichum/ --&gt;. Grimm says that "expositors see in this the  golden fruits of the Earth burnt up by fire and growing again, they liken Sif to [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]", and Grimm says that "with it agrees the fact that [[Old Church Slavonic|O. Slav]]. {{lang|cu-Latn|[[Živa (goddess)|Siva]]}} is a gloss on {{lang|la|Ceres dea frumenti}}" but cites [[etymology|etymological]] problems between the potential cognate. Grimm says that Thor's mother was the earth, and not his wife, yet "we do find the simple ''Sif'' standing for earth." Grimm adds that he is inconclusive regarding Sif and that, "we ought to have fuller details about Sif, and these are wholly wanting in our mythology. Nowhere amongst us is the mystic relation of the seed-corn of [[Demeter]], whose poignant grief for her daughter threatens to bring famine on mankind (Hymn to Cer. 305–306), nor anything like it, recorded."&lt;ref name=GRIMM309-310&gt;Grimm (1888:309–310).&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the etymology of her name, 19th century scholar [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]] theorizes that Sif "betokens mother earth with her golden sheaves of grain; she was the goddess of the sanctity of the family and wedlock".&lt;ref name=VIGFUSSON526/&gt;

Scholar [[Rudolf Simek]] theorizes that Sif likely originated as a complement to Thor through his fertility associations, and that the name ''Sif'' (Simek provides the etymology "relation by marriage") may have originally simply meant "the wife (of Thor)". Simek rejects notions of a "vegetation cult" venerating Sif, says that Sif does not appear to have a function, dismisses theories proposing connections between Sif's hair and grain as "over-zealous interpretation[s]", and theorizes that Snorri invented the story of Sif's shorn locks in attempt to explain the attributes of various gods.&lt;ref name=SIMEK283&gt;Simek (2007:283).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Hilda Ellis Davidson|H. R. Ellis Davidson]] states that Sif may have been an ancient fertility goddess, agreeing with a link between her lustrous hair and fields of [[wheat|golden wheat]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSON84&gt;Davidson (1965:84).&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Sif, Thor, and fertility, Davidson says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

: The cult of Thor was linked up with men's habitation and possessions, and with well-being of the family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a [[storm god]] in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of [[Hieros gamos|divine marriage]] between [[sky deity|sky god]] and [[earth goddess]], when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON-II-72"&gt;Davidson (1975:72).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholar John Lindow proposes that a potentially understated mythological importance of Sif's role in the story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology. Lindow further states that it may be easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.&lt;ref name=LINDOW266&gt;Lindow (2001:266).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rowan ===

Sif has been linked with [[Ravdna]], the consort of the [[Sami shamanism|Sami]] thunder-god [[Horagalles]]. Red berries of [[rowan]] were holy to Ravdna, and the name ''Ravdna'' resembles the North-Germanic words for the tree (for example, Old Norse ''reynir''). According to ''Skáldskaparmál'' the rowan is called "the salvation of Thor" because Thor once saved himself by clinging to it. It has been theorized that Sif was once conceived in the form of a rowan to which Thor clung.&lt;ref name=TURVILLE-PETRE98&gt;Turville-Petre (1964:98).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Lokasenna'' accusations ===
[[File:Loki and Sif by A Chase.jpg|thumb|Sif sleeps while Loki lurks behind in an illustration (1894) by A. Chase]]

Regarding the accusations that Loki makes to Sif in ''Lokasenna'', Carolyne Larrington says that Sif is not elsewhere attested as unfaithful, though notes that Odin makes a similar accusation in ''Hárbarðsljóð'', and theorizes a potential connection between the story of Loki cutting off Sif's hair with these references.

Sif has inspired the name of a [[volcano]] on the planet [[Venus]] ([[Sif Mons]]). Sif's characterization in modern media tends to be much more martial than in original sources. The [[Marvel Comics]] character, [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], is based on the Sif of Norse myth and is portrayed by [[Jaimie Alexander]] in the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', its [[Thor: The Dark World|sequel]], and the ''[[Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D]]'' television series.&lt;ref name=MODERNINFLUENCE&gt;For the volcano, see Lang (2003:221). For the Marvel Comics character, see Mansour (2005:485).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tropical forests''' are forested landscapes in [[tropical]] regions: ''i.e.'' land areas approximately bounded by the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, but possibly affected by other factors such as [[prevailing winds]].
[[File:BorneoRainforest DSC 9267.JPG|thumb|350px|right|[[Borneo]] rainforest]]

Some categories of tropical forest types is difficult. While forests in temperate areas are readily categorised on the basis of tree canopy density, such schemes do not work well in tropical forests.&lt;ref name="Putz_etal"&gt;Francis E. Putz Kent H. Redford (2010) “The Importance of Defining ‘Forest’: Tropical Forest Degradation, Deforestation, Long-term Phase Shifts, and Further Transitions” BIOTROPICA 42(1): 10–20 &lt;/ref&gt; There is no single scheme that defines what a forest is, in tropical regions or elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Putz_etal"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Shvidenko_etal"&gt;Anatoly Shvidenko, Charles Victor Barber, Reidar Persson et al. 2005 "Millennium ecosystem assessment." Ecosystems and human wellbeing: a framework for assessment Washington, DC: Island Press&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these difficulties, information on the extent of tropical forests varies between sources. However Tropical Forests are extensive, making up just under half the world’s forests.&lt;ref&gt; D’Annunzio, Rémi, Lindquist, Erik J.,MacDicken, Kenneth G. 2017 “Global forest land-use change from 1990 to 2010: an update to a global remote sensing  survey of forests Forest Resource Assessment Working Paper 187” FAO, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of tropical forest==
Tropical forests are often thought of as evergreen rainforests and moist forests, however in reality only up to 60% of tropical forest is [[rainforest]]&lt;ref name = "Shvidenko_etal"/&gt; (depending on how this is defined - see maps).  The remaining tropical forests are a diversity of many different forest types including: [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonally-dry tropical forest]],&lt;ref&gt; Rodolfo Dirzo, Hilary S. Young, Harold A. Mooney and Gerado Ceballos (eds). 2011. “Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests: Ecology and Conservation.” Island Press, Washington, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mangrove]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.wisc.edu/courses/botany_422/Lecture/pdf/DryForest.pdf |title=Data |website=www.botany.wisc.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; tropical [[freshwater swamp forest]]s (or "flooded forests" such as the ''[[Várzea forest|Várzea]]'' of the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]]), [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forest]],&lt;ref&gt; Peter G.

(1991) Palaeoecological Background: Neotropics. In: Myers N. (eds) Tropical Forests and Climate. Springer, Dordrecht&lt;/ref&gt; (the higher elevations of which are [[cloud forests]]).  Over even relatively short distances, the boundaries between these [[biome]]s may be unclear, with [[ecotone]]s between the main types.

The nature of tropical forest in any given area is affected by a number of factors, most importantly:
* '''Geographical''': location and [[climatic zone]] (see sub-types), with:
**[[Precipitation]] levels and [[seasonal tropical forest|seasonality]], with strong [[dry season]]s significantly affecting flora (''e.g.'' the predominance of [[lianas]]);&lt;ref&gt;Chen YJ, Cao KF, Schnitzer SA, Fan ZX, Zhang JL, Bongers F (2015) Water-use advantage of lianas over trees in seasonal tropical forests. ''New Phytologist'', '''205'''[1]: 128–136&lt;/ref&gt;
**Temperature profile, which is relatively even in [[equatorial rainforest]] or with a cooler season towards [[subtropical]] latitudes;
**Elevation affects the above, often creating "[[ecological island]]s" with high [[endemism]] (''e.g.'' [[Mount Kinabalu]] in the [[Borneo#Ecology|Borneo]] rainforest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v524/n7565/full/nature14949.html Merckx VCFT, Hendriks KP, Beentjes KK, ''et al.'' (2015) Evolution of endemism on a young tropical mountain. ''Nature'' '''524''': 347–350]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Historical''': prehistoric age of forest and level of recent disturbance (see [[#Threats|threats]]), changing [[primary forest|primary]] (usually maximum [[biodiversity]]) into [[secondary forest]], degenerating into [[bamboo forest]] after prolonged [[swidden agriculture]] (''e.g.'' in several areas of [[Indo-China]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1659/mrd.0875 Heinimann A, Peter Messerli P, Schmidt-Vogt D, Wiesmann U (2007) The Dynamics of Secondary Forest Landscapes in the Lower Mekong Basin: a Regional-scale Analysis. ''Mountain Research and Development'' '''27(3)''': 232-241]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Soil]] characteristics''' (also subject to various [[soil classification|classifications]]): including depth and drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Schulte, A, Ruhiyat D (Eds.) (1998) ''Soils of Tropical Forest Ecosystems: Characteristics, Ecology and Management''. Springer, 204 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''Global 200'' scheme===
The ''[[Global 200]]'' scheme, promoted by the [[World Wildlife Fund]], classifies three main tropical forest habitat types ([[biome]]s), grouping together tropical and sub-tropical areas (maps below):
* [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]],
* [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]],
* [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]].

[[File:Logging Bulletwood Berbice-Guyana JK.JPG|thumb]]
A number of tropical forests have been designated [[High-Biodiversity Wilderness Area]]s, but remain subject to a wide range of disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic. All tropical forests have experienced at least some levels of disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Robin L. Chazdon 2003 “Tropical forest recovery: legacies of human impact and natural disturbances” Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics 6/1,2, pp. 51–71&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in [[Borneo]] describes how, between 1973 and 2018, old-growth forest had been reduced from 76% to 50% of the island, mostly due to fire and [[agricultural expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/factsheet/6552-factsheet.pdf Gaveau DLA (2016) ''What a difference 4 decades make: Deforestation in Borneo since 1973'' CIFOR (retrieved 29 October 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;  A widely-held view is that placing a value on the [[ecosystem services]] these forests provide may bring-about more sustainable policies.  However, clear monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for environmental, social and economic outcomes are needed. For example, a study in Vietnam indicated that poor and inconsistent data combined with a lack of human resources and political interest (thus lack of financial support) are hampering efforts to improve forest land allocation and a Payments for Forest Environmental Services scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-155.pdf Pham TT, Le ND, Vu TP, Nguyen HT, Nguyen VT (2016) ''Forest land allocation and payments for forest environmental services in four northwestern provinces of Vietnam: From policy to practice'' CIFOR (retrieved 29 October 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[continuum mechanics]], '''wave action''' refers to a [[conserved quantity|conservable measure]] of the [[wave]] part of a [[motion (physics)|motion]].&lt;ref name="AM1978"&gt;{{harvtxt|Andrews|McIntyre|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; For small-[[amplitude]] and [[Slowly varying envelope approximation|slowly varying]] waves, the '''wave action density''' is:&lt;ref name="BG1968"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bretherton|Garrett|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \frac{E}{\omega_i},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the intrinsic wave [[energy]] and &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt; is the intrinsic frequency of the slowly modulated waves – intrinsic here implying: as observed in a [[frame of reference]] moving with the [[average|mean]] velocity of the motion.&lt;ref name="Craik1988"&gt;{{harvtxt|Craik|1988|pp=98–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[action (physics)|action]] of a wave was introduced by {{harvtxt|Sturrock|1962}} in the study of the (pseudo) energy and momentum of waves in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s. {{harvtxt|Whitham|1965}} derived the conservation of wave action – identified as an [[adiabatic invariant]] – from an [[averaged Lagrangian]] description of slowly varying [[nonlinear]] wave trains in [[homogeneity and heterogeneity|inhomogeneous]] [[transmission medium|media]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\mathcal{A} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave-action density [[flux]] and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divergence]] of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}&lt;/math&gt;. The description of waves in inhomogeneous and moving media was further elaborated by {{harvtxt|Bretherton|Garrett|1968}} for the case of small-amplitude waves; they also called the quantity ''wave action'' (by which name it has been referred to subsequently). For small-amplitude waves the conservation of wave action becomes:&lt;ref name="BG1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Craik1988"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \frac{E}{\omega_i} \right) + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \left[ \left( \boldsymbol{U} + \boldsymbol{c}_g \right)\, \frac{E}{\omega_i} \right] = 0,&lt;/math&gt; {{pad|2em}} using {{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \frac{E}{\omega_i}&lt;/math&gt; {{pad|1em}} and {{pad|1em}} &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}} = \left( \boldsymbol{U} + \boldsymbol{c}_g \right) \mathcal{A},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{c}_g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[group velocity]] and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{U}&lt;/math&gt; the mean velocity of the inhomogeneous moving medium. While the ''total energy'' (the sum of the energies of the mean motion and of the wave motion) is conserved for a non-dissipative system, the energy of the wave motion is not conserved, since in general there can be an exchange of energy with the mean motion. However, wave action is a quantity which is conserved for the wave-part of the motion.

The equation for the conservation of wave action is for instance used extensively in [[wind wave model]]s to forecast [[sea state]]s as needed by mariners, the offshore industry and for coastal defense. Also in [[plasma physics]] and [[acoustics]] the concept of wave action is used.

The derivation of an exact wave-action equation for more general wave motion – not limited to slowly modulated waves, small-amplitude waves or (non-dissipative) [[conservative system]]s – was provided and analysed by {{harvtxt|Andrews|McIntyre|1978}} using the framework of the [[generalised Lagrangian mean]] for the separation of wave and mean motion.&lt;ref name="Craik1988"/&gt;
