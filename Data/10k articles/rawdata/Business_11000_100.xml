An '''adulterant''' is a [[pejorative]] term for a substance found within other substances such as [[food]], [[fuel]]s or chemicals even though it is not allowed for legal or other reasons.

It will not normally be present in any specification or declared contents of the substance, and may not be legally allowed. The addition of adulterants is called '''adulteration'''. The most common reason for adulteration is the use by manufacturers of undeclared materials that are cheaper than the correct and declared ones.  The adulterants may be harmful, or reduce the potency of the product, or they may be harmless.

The term "[[contamination]]" is usually used for the inclusion of unwanted substances due to accident or negligence rather than intent, and also for the introduction of unwanted substances after the product has been made.  Adulteration therefore implies that the adulterant was introduced deliberately in the initial manufacturing process, or sometimes that it was present in the raw materials and should have been removed, but was not.

An adulterant is distinct from, for example, permitted [[food additive]]s. There can be a fine line between adulterant and additive; [[chicory]] may be added to [[coffee]] to reduce the cost or achieve a desired flavour—this is adulteration if not declared, but may be stated on the label. [[Chalk]] was often added to [[bread flour]]; this reduces the cost and increases whiteness, but the [[calcium]] actually confers health benefits, and in modern bread a little chalk may be included as an additive for this reason.

In wartime adulterants have been added to make foodstuffs "go further" and prevent shortages. The German word ''[[ersatz]]'' is widely recognised from such practices during [[World War II]]. Such adulteration was sometimes deliberately hidden from the population to prevent loss of morale and propaganda reasons. Some goods considered luxurious in the [[Communist Bloc]] such as coffee were adulterated to make them affordable to the general population.

Adulterants added to reduce the amount of expensive product in [[illicit drugs]] are called [[cutting agent]]s. Deliberate addition of toxic adulterants to food or other products for human consumption is [[poison]]ing.

==In food and beverages==
Past and present examples of adulteration, some dangerous, include:
* Roasted [[chicory]] roots used as an adulterant for [[coffee]]
* [[Diethylene glycol]], used dangerously by some winemakers in [[sweet wine]]s
* [[Apple]] jellies (jams), as substitutes for more expensive fruit [[Fruit preserves|jellies]], with added colorant and sometimes even specks of wood that simulate raspberry or strawberry seeds
* [[Water]], for diluting [[milk]] and [[alcoholic beverage]]s
* [[Cutting agent]]s used to adulterate (or "cut") illicit drugs—for example, [[shoe polish]] in [[hashish]], [[amphetamine]]s in [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], [[lactose]] in [[cocaine]]
* [[Urea]], [[melamine]] and other nonprotein [[nitrogen]] sources, added to [[protein]] products to inflate crude protein content measurements&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news

==History==
Historically, the use of adulterants has been common; sometimes dangerous substances have been used. In the [[United Kingdom]] up to the [[Victorian era]], adulterants were common; for example, [[cheese]]s were sometimes colored with [[lead]]. Similar adulteration issues were seen in industry in the [[United States]], during the 19th century. There is dispute over whether these practices declined primarily due to government regulation or to increased public awareness and concern over the practices.

In the early 21st century, cases of dangerous adulteration occurred in the [[People's Republic of China]].

In some African countries, it is not uncommon for thieves to break electric [[transformer]]s to steal [[transformer oil]], which is then sold to the operators of roadside [[food stall]]s to be used for [[deep frying]]. When used for frying, it is reported that transformer oil lasts much longer than regular [[cooking oil]]. The downside of this misuse of the transformer oil is the threat to the health of the consumers, due to the presence of [[PCBs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/12/thieves-fry-kenya-power-grid-fast-food-2014122884728785480.html Thieves fry Kenya's power grid for fast food], Al Jazeera, 2014-12-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Adulterant use was first investigated in [[1820#Events|1820]] by the German chemist [[Frederick Accum]], who identified many toxic metal colorings in food and drink. His work antagonized food suppliers, and he was ultimately discredited by a scandal over his alleged mutilation of books of the [[Royal Institution]] library. The physician [[Arthur Hill Hassall]] conducted extensive studies in the early 1850s, which were published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' and led to the 1860 Food Adulteration Act and other legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Coley |first= Noel |date= 1 March 2005 |title= The fight against food adulteration |url= https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-fight-against-food-adulteration/2020253.article |magazine= [[Education in Chemistry]] |volume= 42 |issue= 2 |pages= 46–49 |publisher= [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |access-date= 19 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Postgate (food safety campaigner)|John Postgate]] led a further campaign, leading to another Act of 1875, which forms the basis of the modern legislation and a system of [[public analyst]]s who test for adulteration.

At the turn of the 20th century, industrialization in the United States led to a rise in adulteration which inspired some protest. Accounts of adulteration led the [[New York Evening Post|New York ''Evening Post'']] to parody:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Mary had a little lamb,
And when she saw it sicken,
She shipped it off to Packingtown,
And now it's labeled chicken.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey M. Pilcher, ''Food in World History'' New York: [[Routledge]], 2006, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even in the 18th century, people complained about adulteration in food:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The bread I eat in London is a deleterious paste, mixed up with chalk, alum and bone ashes, insipid to the taste and destructive to the constitution. The good people are not ignorant of this adulteration; but they prefer it to wholesome bread, because it is whiter than the meal of corn [wheat]. Thus they sacrifice their taste and their health. . . to a most absurd gratification of a misjudged eye; and the miller or the baker is obliged to poison them and their families, in order to live by his profession." – [[Tobias Smollet]], ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' (1771)&lt;ref name="weston"&gt;[http://www.westonaprice.org/modern-diseases/digestive-disorders/621-against-the-grain.html Weston A.Price: Against the Grain, Section Bread to Feed the Masses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Incidents of adulteration==

* In 2007, samples of [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]] mixed with [[melamine]], presumably to produce inflated results from tests for protein content, were discovered in the USA. They were found to have come from China. ''(See: [[Chinese protein adulteration]].)''
* In 2008, significant portions of China's [[milk]] supply were found to have been adulterated with melamine. [[Infant formula]] produced from this milk killed at least six children and is believed to have harmed thousands of others. ''(See: [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]].)''
* In 2012, a study in India across 29 states and union territories found that milk was adulterated with detergent, fat, and even [[urea]], and diluted with water. Just 31.5% of samples conformed to FSSAI standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sinha |first=Kounteya |date=10 January 2012 |title=70% of milk in Delhi, country is adulterated |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-of-milk-in-Delhi-country-is-adulterated/articleshow/11429910.cms |newspaper=Times of India |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Daniel Alexander Bagot''' (25 December 1893 – 12 June 1968), generally known as "Alec" or "E. D. A. Bagot" was a South Australian adventurer, polemicist and politician active in the first half of the 20th Century, and related to Captain [[Charles Hervey Bagot]].

==Early life==
His father, the Rev. E(dward) Arthur Bagot ( – 19 January 1930) of Kildoon, [[County Kildare]], and mother had arrived in Adelaide on the ''Ormuz'' on 21 July 1891. Mrs Bagot had a daughter at 73 Hill Street, North Adelaide, and the son was born in [[Magill, South Australia|Magill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25673545 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=27 December 1893 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not Henley Beach--&gt; on Christmas Day, 1893. In 1894 they moved to Western Australia, where they had another son on 6 November 1895 at [[Cottesloe, Western Australia|Cottesloe Beach]] and in 1899 returned to England, eventually retiring to [[Brighton]].

E. D. A. Bagot was educated at [[Framlingham College|Framlingham]] and [[Lowestoft College|Lowestoft]] Colleges, in [[Suffolk]], joined the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]], assigned as second wireless operator to the ''[[S.S. Olympic]]'', and was on that ship when she received the fateful last broadcasts of her sister ship ''[[S.S. Titanic|Titanic]]''.

==Military service==
At the outbreak of war in 1914 he was in Australia working for the Commonwealth Radio Service (later Postmaster-General's Department) at [[Alberton, South Australia]]. He applied for enlistment several times, and was finally accepted on 11 September 1916, and married Christobel Bollen on 20 September 1916. (Curiously, in his Army enlistment papers he gave his place of birth as [[Lowestoft]], England.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=3043823 National Archives Service dossier for E. D. A. Bagot]&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Australian Imperial Forces as a lieutenant in the 1st Australian (Wireless) Signals Squadron, led by Major Charles William Marr, and left on the ''Karmala'' for the Middle East on 21 September 1916 and served in India and [[Mesopotamia]], [[Mentioned in Despatches]] in 1918 (once not twice, and contrary to some references he was never awarded a [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]), promoted to captain on 1 October 1918 and returned to Australia on 14 April, his appointment terminating in Adelaide on 23 May 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar life==

After the war he spent another eight years organising tourist services between [[Iraq]], Persia (now [[Iran]]) and [[Syria]] for the Mesopotamian Trading Agency of Ashar, [[Basrah]]. His wife may have joined him in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4177380 |title=Classified Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=16 August 1924 |accessdate=27 March 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to South Australia in 1926 with the intention of setting up a regular service between Adelaide and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] via [[Oodnadatta, South Australia|Oodnadatta]] and [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60937479 |title=Adelaide to Darwin. |newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |location=Qld. |date=7 April 1926 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conducted a demonstration run with eight men and four women in three [[Studebaker]] cars and a [[Thornycroft]] truck,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/thornycroft/lorries/endurance.htm |title=Thornycroft lorries feats of endurance |access-date=23 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014205811/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/thornycroft/lorries/endurance.htm |archive-date=14 October 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving Adelaide on 18 May and arrived in Darwin on 3 June; left there on 7 June and returned to Adelaide on 25 June, travelling via [[Camooweal, Queensland]] and [[Marree, South Australia]], publicised by Duncan and Fraser (agents for both Thornycroft and Studebaker) and as they were equipped with a short-wave transceiver, gave nightly reports on radio 5CL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article56567213 |title=Communicating with Overland Motorists |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=29 May 1926 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a second successful round trip that year, Bagot abandoned his idea of regular service when the Commonwealth Government turned down his application for a subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54821501 |title=North–South Transport. |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=24 November 1926 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found employment with [[General Motors]] and in 1930 "Captain Bagot" as he was called by admirers (or "'Alphabetical Bagot' as he was known to the many who disliked him),&lt;ref&gt;Nethercote, J. N. ''Liberalism and the Australian Federation'' p.143 Federation Press, 2001 {{ISBN|1862874026}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded the Citizens' League of South Australia, which opposed Unionism, Communism and the White Australia Policy as benefiting the working classes, yet also opposing Fascism. This was the time of the [[Great Depression]] and he also supported the Young People's Employment Council and the Rev. [[Samuel Forsyth (Methodist)|Samuel Forsyth]]'s (1881–1960) Forsyth Industrial Colony "Kuitpo Colony" near [[Kuitpo Forest]], which was training boys as farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32591153 |title=Unemployed Youth |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=2 December 1932 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Citizen's League attempted political influence by promising support to political candidates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59387712 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=28 January 1933 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=3 Section: Advertising |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a factor in the election of the Independent candidate [[George Connor (Australian politician)|George Connor]] to the [[South Australian House of Assembly|Assembly]] seat of Alexandra in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47535894 |title=Independent Wins By-Election |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=12 February 1934 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 he founded Wannaway Options Limited, a gold-mining company with ten leases in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article74008313 |title=Wannaway Options Limited |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=2 June 1933 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=23 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new company, New Milo Gold Mining, was set up to take over the options held by Wannaway which was voluntarily liquidated in August the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article34620402 |title=Mining |newspaper=[[Western Argus|Western Argus (Kalgoorlie, WA : 1916 – 1938)]] |location=Kalgoorlie, WA |date=8 August 1933 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a committee member of the S.P.C.A., one of many organisations supported by Mrs Alec Bagot. He founded the Australian Listeners' League in 1937, with the principal aim of having the Radio Listener's Licence fee halved from one guinea (£1.1s) to 10/6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55929558 |title=1,000 Radio Listeners Join League. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=19 June 1937 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
After several abortive attempts to enter parliament, he was elected to the Southern District seat on the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] in a by-election in 1938, largely on his stand against five year parliamentary terms.

When not a full-time political operator, he was employed in the insurance industry in Adelaide&lt;ref name=adb&gt;Lonie, John, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bagot-edward-daniel-5091/text8499 'Bagot, Edward Daniel (1893–1968)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; then in 1943 moved to [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]], from where he joined the [[Government Insurance Office of New South Wales]]. He was promoted and moved to Sydney, where amongst other duties he edited the in-house magazine ''Security'', retiring in 1963.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; and wrote a well-received biography of [[George S. Coppin]]. His wife was a close friend of Coppin's daughter Lucy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55787627 |title=Women's Interests |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=4 August 1951 |accessdate=13 July 2012 |page=32 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He married Christobel Bollen on 20 September 1916. Her father, Dr. Christopher Bollen (29 July 1866 – 12 September 1952) of "Clovelly", Woodville Road, [[Woodville, South Australia|Woodville]] then [[Fitzroy, South Australia]], was notable as having possibly the longest practising life of any Australian medical practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47435527 |title=Death of Dr. Chris Bollen |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=13 September 1952 |accessdate=26 March 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs Alec Bagot, as she was generally known, was a keen actor and was involved in many charitable organisations.

They had one son, Edward Christopher (5 January 1922 – 14 January 1944), who enlisted in the RAAF in March 1941, and left for England in September 1942 became a Pilot Officer, flying Lancaster bombers in the Pathfinder force for Bomber Command over Germany and was lost, reportedly when his plane crashed near [[Salzgitter|Watenstedt]] in the [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] area. In the absence of evidence, his mother never abandoned hope of his survival and spent years searching for the facts surrounding his disappearance, to the discomfort of the Air Force's Missing, Research and Enquiry Service.

Their first home was "Clovelly", [[Woodville, South Australia]] then until 1937 "Wellington House", Wellington Square, [[North Adelaide, South Australia|North Adelaide]]; then 90 Jeffcott Street, North Adelaide (with a summer residence in [[Stirling, South Australia|Stirling West]]).

==History==
The Argosy was founded in 1925 by Louis Cohen,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2011/05/15/trazzler_slide_show_beautiful_bookstores/slide_show/9/ "The world's most inspiring bookstores"] ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who picked the name, in 
part, because it started with the letter “A” and would be listed early in telephone directories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In October 2012 the Argosy suffered extensive damage during [[Hurricane Sandy]], when bricks dislodged from the 32nd story of the adjacent building and crashed through the store’s roof. The resulting flood affected the top two floors and destroyed many historical artifacts, including acts of congress signed by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''''Asia''''' was an [[United States|American]] [[magazine]] in the 1920s and 1930s that featured reporting about [[Asia]] and its people, including the [[Far East]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]],  and the [[Middle East]]. From 1934 to 1946, it was edited by [[Richard J. Walsh]], with extensive contributions from his wife, [[Pearl S. Buck]]. Under their influence, the journal published many prominent Asian literary and political figures and American authorities. In 1946, after many years of financial trouble, it was merged into a new journal, ''United Nations World''.

==Origins and development==
''Asia'' magazine was established by the [[American Asiatic Association]] in 1898 as ''Journal of the American Asiatic Association''. An editorial in the ''Journal'' explained: "The ignorance of our people in regard to the countries of the Far East is unquestionably a serious obstacle to the legitimate extension of American influence. .&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the American Asiatic Association''. Asia: 17.1 (March 1917). [https://books.google.com/books?id=SQhZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=irgnorance+of+our+people#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 [[Willard Dickerman Straight|Willard Straight]], who had been involved in promoting American trade and investment in Korea and China since the turn of the century,  and his wife, [[Dorothy Payne Whitney|Dorothy Payne Whitney Straight]], bought the magazine and renamed it ''Asia''. and continued its publication as a popular journal of commerce and travel. The Straights also were co-founders of ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Records " &gt;"Records of Asia Magazine" RG 4, pp. 207 208, "Papers of Pearl S. Buck," [http://www.psbi.org/document.doc?id=533 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Willard Straight died of influenza in 1918, his widow took over publication of the magazine. She married [[Leonard K. Elmhirst]] in 1925. The editors included [[Louis D. Froelick]] and   [[John Foord]], and associate editors [[Gertrude Emerson Sen|Gertrude Emerson]] and Marietta Neff. [[Elsie Weil]], who joined the staff about 1920, was the long time managing editor.&lt;ref name="Records " /&gt;[[Frank H. McIntosh (artist)|Frank H. McIntosh]] painted many of the covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askart.com/AskART/M/frank_mcintosh/frank_mcintosh.aspx Ask Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Richard Walsh and Pearl S. Buck==
In January 1934, although ownership remained unchanged, [[Richard J. Walsh]], head of [[John Day Company|John Day publishers]] published his first issue as editor. He announced that the magazine would no longer be a tourist handbook, and despite objections from some readers, the magazine was shifted from advertising luxury goods, travel and promotion of American commerce in the Orient to discussion of international affairs and current Asian culture and literature. In the first editorial Walsh promised readers a wide range of topics and views. The magazine's political stance changed as well. Walsh wrote that it would "look upon Communism as objectively as upon art, and bring to religious concepts as open a mind as we bring to economic problems." Walsh soon brought his new wife, [[Pearl S. Buck]] into the editorial process. {{sfnb|Conn|1996| p= 159-160, 171-173}}

In the following years, Asia underwent revolution and war. Walsh, as publisher of John Day, and Buck, as America's most influential writer about Asia, attracted and recruited a new range of Asian and American writers, many of whom promoted an anti-colonial agenda, such as support for Indian independence, and anti-racist program. Subscriptions rose as Americans become more worried about the oncoming [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Writers included [[William Ernest Hocking]], the Harvard liberal theologian; [[Hu Shih]], leader of China's [[New Culture Movement]]; [[Owen Lattimore]], the emerging authority on Central Asia; [[Lin Yutang]]; [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the Indian independence leader; and reporters such as [[Nathaniel Peffer]]; [[Edgar Snow]],  [[Nym Wales]], and [[Theodore H. White]], who reported from the front line on China before World War II. Buck wrote a regular book review column titled “Asia Book Shelf.” The magazine recruited corresponding editors to gather articles, including [[Gertrude Emerson Sen]] in India and [[Harold John Timperley|H.J. Timperley]], an Australian journalist in China.{{sfnb|Conn|1996| p= 159-160, 171-173}}

In 1941, Walsh and Buck bought the magazine from the Elmhirsts. They changed the name to ''Asia and the Americas'' in November 1942, and Buck assumed the editorship. She continued her attacks on imperialism, particularly British, and offered strong support for colonial independence movements.{{sfnb|Conn|1996| p= 243}} With the end of the war in 1945, however, Americans lost interest in Asia and the magazine suffered a financial crisis. Buck resigned as editor in 1947 merged the magazine with ''[[Free World (magazine)|Free World]]'' and ''Inter-American'' to form a new journal,''United Nations World''.{{sfnb|Conn|1996| p = 297-298}}

A '''chief security officer''' ('''CSO''') is an [[corporation|organization's]] most senior [[corporate officer|executive]] accountable for the development and oversight of policies and programs intended for the mitigation and/or reduction of [[security|compliance, operational, strategic, financial and reputational security risk]] strategies relating to the protection of people, intellectual assets and tangible property.  

The accountabilities of the CSO include, but are not necessarily limited to: 
* In cooperation with the organization’s executive leadership team(s), directs the development of an effective strategy to assess and mitigate risk (foreign and domestic), manage crises and incidents, maintain continuity of operations, and safeguard the organization. 
* Directing staff in identifying, developing, implementing, and maintaining security processes, practices, and policies throughout the organization to reduce risks, respond to incidents, and limit exposure and liability in all areas of information, financial, physical, personal, and reputational risk.
* Ensures the organization’s compliance with the local, national, and international regulatory environments where applicable to the accountability of this role (i.e. privacy, [[Information privacy|data protection]], and environmental, health and safety).
* Researches and deploys state-of-the-art technology solutions and innovative security management techniques to safeguard the organization’s personnel and assets, including intellectual property and trade secrets. Establishes appropriate standards and associated risk controls.
* Develops relationships with high-level officials in law enforcement [and international counterparts] to include in-country security [and international security agencies], intelligence, and other relevant governmental functions as well as private sector counterparts [worldwide].
* Through other internal policy committees, personnel and/or other external resources, coordinates and implements site security, operations, and activities to ensure protection of executives, managers, employees, customers, stakeholders, visitors, etc., as well as all physical and information assets, while ensuring optimal use of personnel and equipment.
 
Digital or cyber security, sometimes referred to as IT security, does have a cooperative inter-connected involvement.  Some organizations have combined various elements of security programs within the "[[chief information security officer]]" (CISO) function. IT security typically addresses security-related risk issues across all layers of an organization's technology stack. This may include:

* Emerging Technologies and Market Trends
* Identity and access management
* Incident and crisis management
* Information and privacy protection
* Risk and compliance management
* Security architecture
* Organizational resiliency programs and assessments
* Threat, intelligence and vulnerability management

      <comment>/* "Hook IP" */ [[Patent]]s are by definition not "secret". In fact, the very original of the word "patent" is as an [[antonym]] of "secret" (as in: "we don't make it secret, we make it patent, but you require a license from us").</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3877">'''Compliance and Robustness''', sometimes abbreviated as '''C&amp;R''', refers to the legal structure or regime underlying a [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) system. In many cases, the C&amp;R regime for a given DRM is provided by the same company that sells the DRM solution. For example, [[RealNetworks]] Helix or [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Media DRM]].

However, for standardised DRM systems, it is fairly common for a separate body to be established to run the C&amp;R regime.

== Elements ==
=== C&amp;R Body ===
The legal entity that establishes and maintains the regime. Usually this will be a [[joint venture]] or forum with representation from multiple companies, structured in such as way as to avoid accusations of [[antitrust]] violations. The nature of the business is that such bodies will generally be composed of manufacturers and content owners, with little or no direct representation from consumer advocates.

=== Trust Model ===
The C&amp;R body is responsible for ensuring a chain of trust, such that the original content provider is sufficiently satisfied that their content will remain adequately secure throughout all future links in the chain. This may include export of content from one DRM system to another.

To meet this requirement, it is normal that any device planning to receive DRMed content is required to validate that it meets the C&amp;R requirements, and this is usually done using a [[device certificate]] of some kind. The issuance of such certificates is the stamp of approval for both the manufacturer and the device.

If two devices can verify that they both have trusted certificates, they can then reasonably expect that content passed between them will remain secure.

=== Compliance Rules ===
In many cases there will be gaps, ambiguities or options left open in a DRM technical specification. The C&amp;R regime must clarify exactly how a compliant device is to behave in these cases. For example, a compliance rule may define which other types of interfaces are acceptable on a device, something that the technical specification itself will never do.

=== Robustness Rules ===
The most controversial aspect of C&amp;R is the agreement on how to ensure that a device is sufficiently robust at resisting attacks. These rules may require that certain elements are implemented only in hardware, or run on secure CPUs, or that the code must not be available as open source. Manufacturers then have to satisfy the C&amp;R body that they meet this requirement before they are granted access to the certificates needed to establish their products as trusted.

=== "Hook IP" ===
One particular trick that is often used is to include some [[patent]]ed technology, often as part of the trust establishment mechanism. This means that anyone wanting to implement the DRM in a way that will work with others is forced to license these patents. A condition of obtaining such a license is to follow the rules of the C&amp;R regime itself. Thus a C&amp;R body has a 20-year window to pursue legal measures against a "rogue" implementation on the grounds of patent violation, rather than having to rely on a [[DMCA]]-style regulation provided by the relevant government. The need to license hook IP patents also impacts anyone thinking of building a product covered by the [[GPL]].

One well-known example of a system employing such Hook IP is the DVB Common Scrambling Algorithm [[DVB-CSA]], which though standardised by [[ETSI]], includes patented elements that are only licensed to approved [[Conditional access]] systems vendors who agree to maintain the secrecy and integrity of the algorithm in their chip designs.

== Examples ==
* [[OMA DRM]] is governed by the [http://www.cm-la.com/ CMLA] C&amp;R regime
* [[DTCP-IP]] is governed by the [http://www.dtcp.com/ DTLA] C&amp;R regime

'''Event marketing''' is the [[marketing]] of a brand, service, or product through [[promotional event]]s.{{r|Targosz}}{{r|Jaworowicz1}} It typically involves direct contact with the brand's representatives, allowing for more direct interaction. Events are also a way to develop a relationship with [[Media (communication)|media]] outlets, and work as an alternative for [[direct marketing]]. They may also be classified as an [[internal communication]] tool within a certain company. It should not be confused with [[event management]], which is a process of organizing and conducting events while event marketing is a tool to promote brands or products with events.

Event marketing is also considered to be a part of experiential marketing and content marketing. Experiential marketing follows the process of corporate storytelling,{{r|group=n|Petrucci}} and aims to further engage the audience. Experiential follows a simple formula of combining a brand's message and interactive components.{{r|Smith}} This mode of marketing places the target audience in a live environment that will encourage the desired outcome.{{r|Smith}}

Event marketing mostly relies on emotions and the activity of the human brain. Event marketing uses emotions and is based on the fact that people remember what they are experiencing. Emotional stimulus significantly affects the image of the offered service or product. Psychologists proved that while stimulated by emotions, the brain remembers certain facts and pieces of information better. Experiencing something makes it more memorable.{{r|Psych}} In this condition, it is more likely that the brand will stay in the receiver's mind and create a long-lasting image.{{r|Jaworowicz2}}

In a thesis for the International Business and Economics Programme at the [[Luleå University of Technology]], Jessica Eriksson and Anna Hjälmsson wrote:
{{Quote
|text=Event marketing is marketing through events, where marketing is seen as central and the event is considered the actual marketing tool. Event marketing is focusing on a target group and involves high contact intensity. It turns a message into an event that can be experienced by the audience. Several senses are engaged, which increases the chances to remember the experience and thereby also the message.{{r|Eriksson}}
}}

A completely different kind of event marketing is defined by [[Business-to-business|B2B]]. The emotions involved are no longer a representation of the event, but rather, it is a possibility to make business contacts and networking which can only exist through a face-to-face meeting.

== Misconception of the term ==
Event marketing was often misunderstood in the terms of its definition.{{r|Macmillan}} The Cambridge Dictionary{{r|Cambridge}} has two definitions for it:

# The job of advertising products by selling or providing them at events in order to gain new customers.
# The job of advertising different events so that people will go to them.

The term itself became an important area of study in German, American, British, and Canadian markets. Event marketing had been considered equal to the promotion of an event in order to increase the sales of the tickets and was forgotten as a form of marketing.{{r|Targosz}}

This conception changed with excessive studies in the late-20th and early-21st century. [[Philip Kotler]]'s ''Marketing'', which was published at the beginning of the century, is regarded as the first step to a clear definition of the term.{{r|Kotler}} It was later followed by a Danish publication ''Events as a strategic marketing tool'' written by Dorothe Gerritsen and Ronald van Olderen. Event marketing became recognized as a marketing tool, especially in Poland{{r|Jaworowicz1}} when it was introduced in the early 2000s. (Jaworowicz P., Jaworowicz M., Event marketing w Zintegrowanej Komunikacji Marketingowej, Warszawa 2016.) Polish academics mostly relied on Western studies and managed to build up the whole concept.

== Event marketing worldwide ==
Recently, event marketing has been gaining attention globally as its definition is acknowledged by a larger group of people.

According to The US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the event industry will grow by 44% from 2010 to 2020.{{r|Ferrell}} A [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of marketers (31%) believe event marketing to be the single-most effective marketing channel, with 27% voting on [[Content marketing|Content Marketing]], and 25% on [[Email marketing|Email Marketing]].{{r|Rafalson}}

[[HubSpot]] has listed 11 experiential marketing campaigns from worldwide renowned brands like [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Zappos]], and [[Guinness]], who have hosted or created events as an innovative way of advertising a product.{{r|Becker}} Each of them were successful and attracted thousands of new customers. Marketing Insider Group has also listed 5 event marketing examples that are still being talked about. Among them, The Kia Dream Chute is mentioned as one of the best ideas. All of those events are considered one of the best marketing campaigns in the world.{{r|Brenner}}

A study made by [[Jack Morton Worldwide]] shows that 11 out of 14 consumers prefer to get to know new products or services by experiencing them personally.{{r|Gordon}}

Moreover, 74% of consumers say that connecting with branded event marketing experiences is making them more likely to buy the products which are being promoted.{{r|Report}} That's a statistic from the report by The Event Marketing Institute and Mosaic.

== Event marketing strategy ==
Due to the misunderstanding in regards to event marketing, its [[strategy]] has become recognized as a strategy of promoting a certain event. In the light of the right definition, event marketing strategy should be understood as a tailor-made plan to promote a brand/product with events as an advertising tool. The whole strategy should include an in-depth analysis of the plans of brand's presence on events. One of the only sources in this topic: eventory.cc highlights the importance of identifying the role in the event. This step includes answers whenever someone should actually participate in the event (conferences, fairs or exhibitors, participants), sponsor it or organize it. Such an analysis would take place while taking all other possible factors into the account. Further studies are required in this topic.

In order to measure the success of event marketing, the brand impact has to be verified. Based on [[Advertising Research Foundation]] (ARF) made in March 2006, engagement is "turning on a prospect to a brand idea enhanced by the surrounding context".{{r|Creamer}} There was also a function created to show the impact on a brand: ''Engagement + Trust x Targeted Group = Brand Impact.''

== Types of events ==
According to thebalance.com, events can be sorted out into nine different groups:

# Seminars and conferences - for educational purposes.
# Trade shows - lead generation activity.
# Executive retreats and incentive programs - enjoyable activities mixed with business development.
# Golf events - relationship management.
# Appreciation events - building a rapport in informal environment.
# Company or organization milestones - the opportunity to celebrate company's achievements.
# Team building events - build upon a company's strengths.
# Product launch events - creating a "buzz" around new product.
# Board meetings and shareholder meetings - meeting &amp; reviewing business performances.{{r|Hard}}

'''Flora Call Disney''' (April 22, 1868{{spaced ndash}}November 26, 1938) was the mother of [[Walt Disney|Walt]] and [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]].

==Family==
Call was born in [[Steuben, Ohio]], the daughter of Henrietta (née Gross; 1837–1910) and Charles Call (1823–1890), who were neighbors of Kepple Disney, father of [[Elias Disney]], her husband. She was of [[Germany|German]] and English descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/cheney.html|title=Ancestry of Dick Cheney (b. 1941)|work=wargs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Death==
Flora died in 1938 in an accident that plagued her son Walt with grief for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSJIngvkCsAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Disney Magic Every Day of Your Life | publisher=HCI | author=Williams, Pat | year=2004 | pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of their film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', in 1938, Walt and Roy presented their parents with a new home in [[North Hollywood]], near the Disney studios in [[Burbank, California]]. Less than a month after moving in, Flora complained to Walt and Roy of problems with the gas furnace in her new home. Studio repairmen were sent to the house, but the problem was not adequately fixed.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Flora wrote a letter to her daughter Ruth describing the wonderful new home, but again complaining of the fumes from the furnace. A few days later, Flora died of [[asphyxiation]] caused by the fumes at age 70.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} She is entombed next to her husband in Glendale's [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3034">'''Fransisco Aupa Indongo''' (born January 15 1936), is a prominent Namibian businessman and former politician. He  owns Continental Enterprises, Indongo Toyota, Frans Indongo Gardens, Farm Gelukwater, Select Service and Gas Station and various shares in mining and fishing companies in Namibia. He is the father-in-law of prominent lawyer Sisa Namandje and prominent banker Wosman Hamukonda. He is third on the list of Namibia's top ten richest people, behind the Pupkewitz and Olthaver &amp; List families.

==Business career==
Indongo opened his first business, which made bricks, in the late 1950s. With the profits from that business, he bought sewing equipment for cloth making, which he sold in [[Oranjemund]]. In 1961, he opened a small shop in [[Omusimboti]], Oshana which eventually allowed him to open a chain of supermarkets across the country. Indongo owns a large number of properties across Namibia, including prominent locations in [[Swakopmund]], [[Tsumeb]], [[Walvis Bay]], [[Otjiwarongo]] and [[Windhoek]] as well as holdings in the sugar and fishing industries.
He is a very well known successful entrepreneur

==Political career==
Indongo entered politics in the 1970s as a leading member of the [[National Democratic Party (Namibia)|National Democratic Party]], which became part of the [[Democratic Turnhalle Alliance]] following the completion of the [[Turnhalle Constitutional Conference]] in 1977. At the Turnhalle Conference, Indongo was an important member of the [[Ovamboland]] delegation. He was Minister of Economic Affairs in the Owambo legislative assembly from 1975 and from 1980 a Minister in the Owambo Second Tier Representative Authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=64 Frans Indongo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722235133/http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=64 |date=2011-07-22 }} at the Namibia Institute for Democracy, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, he was a founding member of the [[Christian Democratic Action for Social Justice]], led by [[Peter Kalangula]]. He resigned from politics in the late 1980s to manage his business affairs.

==Honours==
In 2001, Indongo received an honorary doctorate in business administration from the [[University of Namibia]]. In 2003, a street was named after him in downtown Windhoek.
Indongo owns Etango Complex in Oshakati, one of the highest standard buildings in northern Namibia.

'''Hearst Television, Inc.''' (formerly '''Hearst-Argyle Television''') is a broadcasting company in the [[United States]] owned by [[Hearst Communications]]. From 1998 to mid-2009, the company traded its common stock on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the symbol "HTV."

Hearst-Argyle was formed in 1997 with the merger of Hearst Corporation's broadcasting division and stations owned by '''Argyle Television Holdings II''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19263839.html Rathbun, Elizabeth A. "Hearst stocks up on Argyles; merged TV group with 14 stations, 11.6% coverage is valued at $1.8 billion.], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]''. March 31, 1997. [[HighBeam Research]]. (February 17, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; which is partially related to the company of the same name who (in 1994) sold its stations to [[New World Communications]], stations that eventually became [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]-owned stations (Hearst itself, unusual for any American broadcast group, has never held a Fox affiliation on any of their stations). Hearst's involvement in broadcasting dates to the 1920s.

In terms of audience reach, Hearst is the third-largest group owner of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated stations, behind the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], and ahead of [[Tegna, Inc.]], and the second-largest group owner of [[NBC]] affiliates, behind Tegna.

Hearst-owned ABC affiliates in [[National Football League]] markets simulcast ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games from [[ESPN]] that involve these teams - ESPN is 20% owned by Hearst, the rest being owned by ABC's parent, [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Other Hearst-owned stations also carry ESPN-aired NFL games, even though they are affiliated with other networks (like [[WBAL-TV]], Baltimore's NBC affiliate). Hearst also holds some [[joint venture]]s for [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]] with [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]].

On June 3, 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that it would purchase substantially all of the stock not held by Hearst. Hearst-Argyle Television then dropped "Argyle" from its name and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation.&lt;ref name="Hearst Broadcasting Merger"&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/277983-Hearst_Moves_On_Merger.php Hearst Moves On Merger], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital television==
In February 2009, Hearst-Argyle announced that its stations (except for [[KITV]] and its satellites in [[Hawaii]], which had already completed their transition to digital, and [[WPTZ]] in [[Plattsburgh, New York]] and [[WNNE]] in [[Hartford, Vermont]], which followed the other [[Champlain Valley]] in transitioning on February 17, 2009) would comply with the new DTV transition date of June 12, 2009.

==Hearst-owned stations==
[[File:Hearst-Argyle Television logo.png|right|thumb|Hearst-Argyle Television logo, 2007-2009]]
Currently, Hearst owns a total of 34 overall television stations but considers two groups of four stations and an NBC station with an ABC [[digital subchannel]] joint operations, bringing their count down to 31 under that consideration: eleven NBC affiliates, fifteen ABC affiliates (one as a subchannel of an NBC affiliate, and one which acts as a two-station simulcast), two [[CBS]] affiliates, six [[The CW|CW]] affiliates (two traditional, two subchannel (which are part of a two-station simulcast), and two channel shares), two [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliates (one traditional, one subchannel), and one [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]]. Most of the company's subchannel stations broadcast either [[Weigel Broadcasting]]'s [[MeTV]] or NBC's [[Cozi TV]] through national affiliation deals, along with being charter carriers of Weigel's two newest concepts, [[Heroes &amp; Icons]] and [[Movies!]]. Since December 1, 2014, [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] CBS affiliate [[KCCI]] has used their third subchannel as an H&amp;I affiliate carrying MyNetworkTV programming in primetime. Hearst also owns two radio stations in [[Baltimore]], the last remaining from the company divesting most of their radio assets after the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] went into effect. As already mentioned above, none of Hearst's stations have ever held a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliation, with the exception of two WMUR translators in the northern part of New Hampshire dis-affiliating with the network upon Hearst's assumption of ownership of WMUR.

[[File:Candy Altman at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards for Hearst-Argyle Television-Commitment 2008.jpg|thumb|Candy Altman at the 68th Annual [[Peabody Awards]] for Hearst-Argyle Television-Commitment 2008]]

Some Hearst-owned stations use the "Commitment (Year)" banner for all political news coverage leading up to the local, national, and statewide elections in lieu of a localized version of their associated network's political branding. This started in 2000. Hearst also maintains a [[Washington, D.C.]] [[News bureau|bureau]] to assist their stations in coverage of national politics, including on-air reporters and facilities and equipment assistance for local stations. Many Hearst stations license the "Operation High School" branding for coverage of local [[high school sports]]. In 2007, Hearst-Argyle became one of the first television broadcasting groups to post their news stories on [[YouTube]]. [[WCVB]], [[KCRA-TV|KCRA]], [[WTAE-TV|WTAE]], [[WBAL-TV|WBAL]] and [[WMUR-TV|WMUR]] were the first stations in Hearst-Argyle's station group to do this.

Until 2009, three of Hearst's television stations ([[KCWE]], [[WMOR-TV]], and [[WPBF]]) and its two radio stations ([[WBAL (AM)|WBAL radio]] and [[WIYY]]) were owned by Hearst Broadcasting, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation through which Hearst ultimately controlled Hearst-Argyle Television, as opposed to Hearst-Argyle itself; Hearst-Argyle still operated these stations under a management services agreement. These stations were transferred to Hearst Television shortly after its privatization.&lt;ref name="fcc-hearstmsa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanation to FCC of Hearst-Argyle privatization|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101312805&amp;qnum=5010&amp;copynum=1&amp;exhcnum=1|format=PDF|date=May 18, 2009|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fcc-hearsttransfer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanation to FCC of Hearst reorganization|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101324506&amp;qnum=5010&amp;copynum=1&amp;exhcnum=1|format=PDF|date=July 29, 2009|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst's television and radio cluster in Baltimore additionally serves as the [[flagship station]]s and operation bases for the [[Baltimore Ravens]] radio and television networks.

On August 20, 2014, it was announced that Hearst Television would acquire [[WVTM]] in Birmingham, Alabama and [[WJCL (TV)|WJCL]] in Savannah, Georgia from [[Media General]], which divested those stations under FCC advisement as part of their acquisition of [[LIN Media]].&lt;ref name="tvnc-saletohearst"&gt;{{cite news|title=Media General, LIN Sell Stations In 5 Markets|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/78615/media-general-lin-sell-stations-in-5-markets|accessdate=August 20, 2014|work=TVNewsCheck|date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b&amp;c-saletohearst"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Michael|title=Media General, LIN Divest Stations in Five Markets|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/media-general-lin-divest-stations-five-markets/133323|accessdate=August 20, 2014|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2017, Hearst acquired majority control of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]-based [[broadcast syndication|syndicator]] [[Litton Entertainment]], which has control of four of the five [[E/I]]-compliant Saturday morning blocks on the five major broadcast networks, along with being a syndicator of traditional programming. The deal closed on February 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/hearst-entertainment-litton-acquires-syndication-1201954104/|title=Hearst Acquires Majority Stake in Independent Distributor Litton Entertainment |last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=6 January 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television production===

Hearst Television also produces the weekly public-affairs program ''[[Matter of Fact with Soledad O'Brien]]'', which in fall 2018 entered its fourth season. Outside of the Hearst stations and [[A&amp;E (TV network)|A&amp;E]], the show is distributed in national [[broadcast syndication]] by [[Sony Pictures Television]].

Other Notes:
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; KCWE in Kansas City has been managed by Hearst since its sign-on in 1996.
* &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; As a result of the [[Spectrum reallocation#Broadcast incentive auction|incentive auction]], WNNE channel shares with WPTZ after the sale of its former spectrum. WNNE previously served [[Hartford, Vermont]] and [[Hanover, New Hampshire]] as a [[semi-satellite]] of WPTZ.
* &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; As a result of the incentive auction, WCWG channel shares with WXII after the sale of its former spectrum. Hearst purchased WCWG outright on February 12, 2018 from former owner [[Lockwood Broadcast Group]], but operated the station under a secondary [[Local marketing agreement|shared services arrangement]] after the channel share went into effect on July 31, 2017.

'''Notes:'''
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; WDTN was an ABC affiliate under Hearst during its ownership; LIN switched the station's affiliation back to NBC in 2004.
*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; WNAC-TV was owned by Argyle, but operated from 1996 to 2001 by [[Clear Channel Communications]] under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with [[WPRI-TV]], which Clear Channel owned at the time.

In addition to the above, Hearst-Argyle never owned WZZM or WGRZ. Those two stations were divested by one of the company's predecessors, Argyle Television Holdings II, several months prior to the merger with Hearst Broadcasting. The "years owned" information reflects the years of ownership by Argyle Television Holdings II. And WDTN was the only formerly owned television station that was owned directly by Hearst prior to the merger.

'''Henry Croft''' (January 15, 1856 &amp;ndash; July 28, 1917) was an [[Australia|Australian-born]] lumber and mining magnate on [[Vancouver Island]] in the early 1900s. He founded the town of [[Crofton, British Columbia|Crofton]], [[British Columbia]] in 1902 as a place to house the smelter for his coal mine on [[Mount Sicker]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia at [[Darling Point, New South Wales|Darling Point]], in a place called [[Mount Adelaide]], he migrated to [[England]] at the age of one, after the death of his mother. He moved back to Australia after finishing school in 1879, but then went to the [[United States]], where his brother was living. Soon after in 1882, he again moved, this time to [[Canada]], staying at [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]]. It was here he met Mary Jean Dunsmuir, daughter of [[Robert Dunsmuir]]. They married on June 29, 1885.

In 1890, Croft was elected to the [[British Columbia Legislature]] with 146 votes, or 34.27% of the ballots, representing the [[Cowichan (electoral district)|Cowichan]] region. He served this post for the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elections BC|authorlink=Elections BC|title=Electoral History of British Columbia, 1871–1986|publisher=[[Queen's Printer#British Columbia|Queen's Printer for British Columbia]]|year=1988|location=[[Victoria, British Columbia]]|page=55|ISBN=0-7718-8677-2|url=http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/1871-1986_ElectoralHistoryofBC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had developed the prosperous Lenora mine at nearby Mount Sicker in 1898. By 1902, his mine was producing more ore than railway cars could load and haul away to the [[Ladysmith, British Columbia|Ladysmith]] and Nanaimo, [[British Columbia|Nanaimo]] ports. Inspired by significant profits, Croft bought the townsite of [[Crofton, British Columbia|Crofton]] to build a copper smelter and house his workers.

On July 28, 1917, Croft died at the age of 61 at his home, Mount Adelaide, in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]. His wife, Mary, died on August 15, 1928. By the time of Croft's death, his smelter had long ago disappeared, and rumours of building a large sawmill in Crofton had been raging. However, none of them ever came about.

==Association==
Henry Croft was a member of many different societies as a result of his mining involvement:
*Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]]
*Member of the [[Institute of Mining Engineers]]
*Member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16162">'''High-density solids pumps''' are hydrostatically operating machines which displace the medium being pumped and thus create a flow.

==High-density solids and their transport==
High-density solids are mixtures of liquid and solid constituents; examples include farm grain, pulled pork, etc..  Each have their own typical physical and chemical characteristics such as specific weight, solids content, maximum particle size as well as how they behave, for example [[Thixotropy|thixotropically]], abrasively or adhesively.

Typical examples for high-density solids are [[concrete]], [[sludge]]s and [[slurries]].

Within industrial plants many substances with high proportion of solids - such as mechanically dewatered sewage sludges, filter cakes, bituminous coal sludges, waste and process sludges - have to be transported over relatively great distances to landfills or incineration plants.

In principle, long conveying distances can be bridged with mechanical conveying equipment or hydraulic high-density solids pumps.

Types of '''mechanical conveyors''' are [[Conveyor belt|belt]], [[Screw conveyor|screw]] (worm), or [[Conveyor chain#scraper|scraper]]. They are suitable for nearly all types of high-density solids.

'''Hydraulic high-density solids pumps''' move sludges and slurries within an enclosed pipeline. However, not every sludge or slurry is pumpable, depending on:
* Ratio: The mixture of solid and liquid components must be such that it results in a plastically deformable mass.
* Saturation: The volume of pore space in the sludges must be filled with sufficient quantity of liquid matter for particle to be able to rest on particle via a plastically viscous liquid and for the interstices to be filled.
* Gas component: As a consequence of pressure fluctuations, knocking in the pipe may happen. By injection of about 2% air, sludges which do not naturally have a gas component can be brought to a better consistency.

==Types of high-density solids pumps==
Depending on how the displacement principle is implemented, a distinction can be drawn between rotary and reciprocating pumps. The rotary circulation pumps includes eccentric screw pumps, [[centrifugal pump]]s, and squeezed tube (peristaltic) pumps. Reciprocating pumps include plunger, diaphragm, and piston pumps.

The high-density solids pumps which can be used in the widest range of situations is the hydraulically powered piston (or reciprocating) pump. It can be realized as single-cylinder or two-cylinder pump. In the latter case, power is transferred to the material via delivery pistons working in push-pull-mode.While one delivery piston sucks material from the feed hopper into the cylinder, the second piston simultaneously pushes the material in the other delivery cylinder and into the delivery line.

The PUMPMAN series pumps invented in INDIA in 2015-16 are however completely different from the presently available hydraulically operated piston pumps. The PUMPMAN series Pumps have been recently invented which do not use a hydraulic pump and complex hydraulic circuits for their operation. However they use a very simple mechanism which multiplies the reciprocating force several times without using a hydraulic system. These Pumps are protected under multiple patent applications, some of them are already published by the Indian Patent office. They have been invented by Amit &amp; Anand Gokhale.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/small-concrete-pump-pm-25-d-amit-gokhale?trk=hp-feed-article-title-share&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Type: Piston pump with transfer tube (two-cylinder pump)===
[[File:Rohrweichenpumpe Animation.ogv|thumb|300px|Operating principle of piston pump with transfer tube]]

====Construction details====
The most characteristic element of the transfer tube pump is the so-called "S" transfer tube installed inside the feed hopper. The job of the transfer tube is to control the flow of high-density solids - in other words, the pump cylinder which is currently pushing the material is connected to the delivery line by such tube. At (or nearby) the end of each piston stroke the S-shaped tube which is connected to the delivery line is swung over to the other delivery cylinder with the aid of two switch cylinders. A hydraulic circuit is used for synchronizing the position of the transfer tube and the movements of the two delivery pistons.

The S tube should swing over rapidly and not suffer undue wear. This is effected with two large-sized plunger cylinders and a so-called spectacle plate (so named from its shape) including seal rings.

In cross section the S-tube is circular with a diameter which tapers in the direction of flow. This keeps the risk of clogging down. The sealing faces of the spectacle plate and of the seal ring lie parallel with the swivelling movement of the S-tube, so that they cannot be damaged when foreign bodies are cut through or get stuck.

This pump does not need check valves.

====Operating features====
Piston pumps with S-tube are suitable for concrete and mortar, for sludges with a solids content of up to 50% by weight and a fluctuating particle size distribution but also for conveying [[fly ash]], coal or minerals in a suspension.

The large cross section of the holes in the spectacle plate means that with a delivery cylinder diameter of e.g. {{Convert|200|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} it is possible to pump high-density solids with a mean grain size of as much as {{Convert|80|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}. The maximum diameter of individual foreign bodies may be as high as 60% of the diameter of the delivery line - in this example this would be {{Convert|120|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}.

===Type: Piston pump with seat valves (two-cylinder pump)===
[[File:Sitzventilpumpe Animation.ogg|thumb|300px|Operating principle of piston pump with seat valves]]

====Construction details====
The steel housing of the seat valve pump contains four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that the contents of the delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the "sucking" piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the delivery line, the suction valve will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.

This pump does not need check valves.

====Operating features====
Seat valve pumps are suitable for an especially even pumping of media with a solids content of up to 50% and for the high-pressure pumping of paste-like industrial media such as sludges. Since valves are used in this two-cylinder pump it is suitable for grain sizes up to 8mm at most.

Which type of valve is selected will depend on the high-density solids to be conveyed. For materials containing grains with a solids content up to 50% a sharp-edged metal valve seat is required. With low-viscosity, rather watery fine sludges the choice would be a large-area elastomeric valve seal.

In one hydraulic control variant the valve is opened passively by the thrust of the medium. In this case the discharge valve has a non-return function which prevents flowback from the pressure line. At the same time the high-densitiy solids are precompacted to close to the line pressure before the discharge valve opens. This means that pipe knocking resulting from pressure pulsations can be avoided.

===Type: Ball-valve pump (two-cylinder pump)===

====Construction details====
During the suction stroke of the delivery piston the medium is sucked in via the open suction ball valve. At the same time the ball valve on the delivery line is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the suction (automatic valves). In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge ball valve and into the delivery line. The suction ball valve is pushed into its seating by the delivery line pressure and thereby closes off the connection to pump intake.

====Operating features====
The two-cylinder ball valve pump is suitable for in the low to middle pressure range for pumping highly liquid to paste-like media provided these can be sucked in through the valve openings - for example mortars, mineral and sewage sludges.

The ball valve pump is to all intents and purposes insensitive to corrosive and abrasive media since the ball valves do not have to be opened or closed from the outside.

===Type: Single-cylinder piston pump===

====Construction details====
With a single-cylinder piston pump the medium is "stuffed" out of a feed chute into the delivery cylinder and by the cylinder into the delivery line on the forward stroke. Depending on the level of the delivery pressure in the pipe and on the flow properties of the medium, the delivery flange of the pump will be fitted with a flat slide valve or a lamellar non-return valve in order to prevent flowback of the material on the return stroke. Which delivery piston is actually selected will depend on the material which is to be pumped: Free flowing media call for perturbane sealing elements while bulky materials which have to be chopped up during pumping mean that hardened cutting edges are required.

====Operating features====
The single-cylinder pump is suitable for bulk materials with an awkward coarse composition - for example wood chips, organic waste, hazardous waste, or shredded paper. If such unsaturated material is to be conveyed over large distances, one possible approach is the hybrid feed system. Here compressed air is injected into the delivery line. It presses the plug of material into the pipe. As the compressed air expands the material being conveyed is loosened and separated. As distance increases from the air injection point, what was initially a series of plugs gradually turns into a continuous airborne stream. The amount of air required and the appropriate pipe diameter depend on the type and quantity of matter being conveyed.

===Type : Single-cylinder piston pump with an off-center three way rotary gate valve===
The said type of gate valve is having a rotating member inside a rotating valve chamber wherein the center of the valve chamber is off-set with the center line of the pumping cylinder and the pumping cylinder and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's sealing portion as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the pumping cylinder. This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the rotating member. Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the rotating member &amp; the valve chamber allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal lathe machine. This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve. This valve has been invented by Amit and Anand Gokhale.&lt;ref&gt;http://ipindiaonline.gov.in/patentsearch/GrantedSearch/viewdoc.aspx?id=EaXBWM7XcHGElNLd7sM9BA%3d%3d&amp;loc=vsnutRQWHdTHa1EUofPtPQ%3d%3d&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of high-density solids piston pumps==
Main parts are:
* feed hopper
* drive cylinder, delivery cylinder and hydraulic system
* seals
* electrical and control equipment
and - depending on the type:
* transfer tube
* valves
as well as peripheral components such as:
* bunker (with / without sliding frames)
* screw conveyors, pre-press equipment
* pipework
* air injection
* boundary layer injection
* systems for pressure (pulsation) damping

==Solids pump selection==
The special kind of medium "high-density solids" and the wide range of applications require different construction principles and hence pump types. Following table permits a pre-selection depending on the media characteristics:

==Applications==
The hydraulic pumping of solids with high solids contents offers a range of possibilities in process engineering. Oil-hydraulically powered two-cylinder piston pumps with S-transfer tube have already been used for many years in civil engineering for transporting concrete. This technology has been transferred to further areas of application in various sectors of industry.

===Sewage treatment plants===
Mechanically dewatered sewage sludge can be pumped directly into furnaces via a pipe network. This avoids direct contact with the sludges and prevents from contamination and odour emission.

===Waste management (Hazardous waste)===
Hazardous and highly flammable substances are processed physically, chemically and biologically in order to reduce the waste materials. With the advantage of pipeline conveyance, high density solids pumps commonly transport such material.

===Mining===
Real tunneling (in other words, not cut-and-cover) has increased palpably in recent years. Conveying [[mine water]], soil and tailings to the tunnel entrance is a need.

==Boundary conditions==

===Transport routes===
Various aspects have to be considered in the planning and processing of conveying installations. This includes the space requirements, the accessibility in case of maintenance or cleaning purposes, as well as horizontal or vertical transport route for material discharge.

===Environmental protection (Noise and odour reduction)===
Due to the nature of the material and the conveying method, odour nuisances is to be expected. Choosing the appropriate conveying method can reduce the environmental pollution

===Energy expenditure===
Three forces have to be overcome when conveying with high density solids pumps:

# The conveying distance (cf. Record held by [[Concrete pump]])
# Friction between material and pipeline, especially in bends and reduction joints.
# Inner frictional force caused by deformation of the material.
Calculation example:
* Conveyance suspension
* Delivery line of {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} diameter (DN200)
* High-density solids with mineral or carbon content as a mixture from coarse and fine grained material.
* Maximum particle size {{convert|50|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}
* Dry solids content up to 80 percent by weight
Energy consumption = approx. {{convert|50|Wh|abbr=on}} per tonne of conveyed material and per kilometer (280 Btu per long ton or 
250 Btu per short ton per mile).

'''Indriati Gerald Bernardina''' (born 9 June 1942), also known by her stage name '''Indriati Iskak''' and after marriage as '''Indri Makki''', is an Indonesian actress turned psychologist and marketer. Born in [[Surabaya]], she entered the Indonesian film industry and soared to popularity with [[Usmar Ismail]]'s commercially successful ''[[Tiga Dara]]'' (1957). She appeared in eight further films and established her own [[girl group]] before retiring from cinema in 1963. She graduated from the [[University of Indonesia]] with a degree in psychology in 1968, and has taught the subject at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Jakarta Art Institute|id|3=Institut Kesenian Jakarta}}. For twenty-six years she worked with [[Unilever]], and since 1994 she has been a marketing consultant with Makki Makki.

==Biography==
Indriati Iskak was born in [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]], on 9 June 1942. She is the daughter of Raden Iskak,{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=228}} an educator who transitioned to film in 1952, when he became the director of ''[[Penjelendup]]'' (''Smuggler'').{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=406}}

Indriati made her feature film debut in [[Usmar Ismail]]'s ''[[Tiga Dara]]'' (''Three Maidens'') in 1957, starring alongside [[Chitra Dewi]] and [[Mieke Wijaya]]. She portrayed Nenny, the youngest of three sisters raised by their grandmother after their mother's death.{{sfn|Kristanto|2007|p=46}} The film was a massive popular success, and Indriati, who was praised for having a more naturalistic acting style than her stage-trained fellow actors, saw the greatest popularity of her co-stars.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=152}}

The following year Indriati appeared in another of Ismail's film, ''[[Sengketa]]'' (''Conflict'', 1957).

It was directed by her father and co-starred her brother Boy&lt;!--Yes, that's his name--&gt;.{{sfn|Kristanto|2007|p=64}} Indriati's popularity during the 1950s and 1960s has been credited with leading Indonesian film directors to seek out [[Indo people|Indo]]-looking actresses for their films, and thus precipitating the careers of film stars such as [[Lydia Kandou]], [[Meriam Bellina]], and [[Tamara Bleszynski]].{{sfn|Apa Siapa|1999|p=238}} Advertising for [[Perfini]]'s ''[[Asrama Dara]]'' (''Dormitory for Girls''; 1958) touted its young star [[Suzzanna]], an Indo girl from [[Bogor]], as the next Indriati Iskak.{{sfn|Imanjaya|2006|p=112}}

After ''Daun Emas'', Indriati retired from acting and went to university, completing a degree in psychology at the [[University of Indonesia]] in 1968.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=228}} After some time working at the Indonesian Air Force's psychological counselling bureau, in the 1970s she began working at [[Unilever]].{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=228}} She stayed with the company for twenty-six years, at first handling market research before moving on to marketing management and advertising. Towards the end of her time with Unilever, she oversaw the computerisation of the company's Indonesia branch.{{sfn|Makki Makki, Indri}} In the mid-1970s Indriati also taught psychology at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Jakarta Art Institute|id|3=Institut Kesenian Jakarta}},{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=228}} and for fifteen years she was on the board of the Strada system of [[Catholicism in Indonesia|Catholic]] schools.{{sfn|Makki Makki, Indri}}

Indriati married an [[Indonesian Air Force]] officer,{{sfn|Anwar|1991|p=3}} Makki Perdanakusuma (the younger brother of [[Halim Perdanakusuma]]), in 1962. The couple had three children: Sania Makki, Sakti Makki, and Sari Makki. They remained married until Makki Perdanakusuma's death in 2014.{{sfn|Prabowo|2014}} {{As of|2016}}, Indriati is a branding consultant with Makki Makki, having worked there since 1994.

'''John Winthrop Chanler''' (September 14, 1826 – October 19, 1877) was a prominent New York [[lawyer]] and a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was a member of the Dudley–Winthrop family and married a member of the [[Astor family]].

==Early life==

John Winthrop Chanler was born in [[New York City]] on September 14, 1826, the only son of the Rev. Dr. John White Chanler, an [[Episcopalian]] clergyman, and Elizabeth Shirreff Winthrop.  His mother was a great-great-granddaughter of [[Wait Winthrop]] and [[Joseph Dudley]] and a great-great-great granddaughter of [[Peter Stuyvesant]].&lt;ref name="StNick1905"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York: History, Customs, Record of Events, Constitution, Certain Genealogies, and Other Matters of Interest. V. 1-|date=1905|publisher=[[Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York]]|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJM-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32|accessdate=30 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chanler received his early education from private tutors, and graduated from [[Columbia College of Columbia University]] in 1847. He attended the [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg]], studied law, and was admitted to the New York State [[Bar association|Bar]] in 1851.&lt;ref name="bioguide"/&gt;

==Career==
A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] affiliated with [[Tammany Hall]], Chanler was member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (New York Co., 10th D.) in [[81st New York State Legislature|1858]] and [[82nd New York State Legislature|1859]]. He was nominated for [[New York State Senate]] in 1860 but declined.&lt;ref name="bioguide"/&gt;  He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1860 to the [[37th United States Congress|Thirty-seventh]] Congress, losing to the [[Fernando Wood|Mozart Hall Democrats]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit1877"/&gt;

===United States Congress===
Chanler was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[38th United States Congress|Thirty-eighth]], [[39th United States Congress|Thirty-ninth]], and [[40th United States Congress|Fortieth]] [[United States Congress]]es, serving from March 4, 1863 to March 3, 1869.&lt;ref name="bioguide"&gt;{{cite web|title=CHANLER, John Winthrop - Biographical Information|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000302|website=bioguide.congress.gov|publisher=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Congress, Chanler served on the Committee of Bankrupt Law, Committee on Patents, Committee on Southern Railroads.&lt;ref name="NYTObit1877"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JWChouse"&gt;{{cite web|title=CHANLER, John Winthrop {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|url=http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/10835|website=history.house.gov|accessdate=30 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His term in Congress was notable for his censure on May 14, 1866 for an insult to the House of Representatives.  The censure stemmed from a resolution he introduced expressing support for the [[veto]]es of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]], in which Chanler called acts of Congress vetoed by Johnson "wicked and revolutionary," and called House members who overruled the vetoes "malignant and mischievous."&lt;ref&gt;Asher Crosby Hinds, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FeGni_-JxI0C&amp;pg=PA798 Hinds' Precedents of the House of Representatives of the United States], Volume 2, 1907, page 798&lt;/ref&gt;

He was defeated in his reelection to the [[41st United States Congress|41st Congress]] for his hostility to [[Boss Tweed]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit1877"/&gt;

===Later career===
After Tweed was overthrown from running Tammany Hall in 1871, Chanler became a [[Sachem]] and Chairman of the General Committee.  He ultimately gave up the positions in 1875 due to his declining health.&lt;ref name="NYTObit1877"/&gt;

[[Image:Leopold Park.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Leopold Park is a major feature of the area, and retains some of its architectural heritage. The Paul-Henri Spaak building of the [[Espace Léopold]], now housing the European Parliament can be seen in the background.]]

The '''Leopold Quarter''' ({{lang-fr|Quartier Léopold}}, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: {{Audio|Nl-Leopoldswijk.ogg|''Leopoldswijk''}}) is a [[Quarter (country subdivision)|quarter]] of [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. Today the term is sometimes confused with [[Brussels_and_the_European_Union#Quarter|European Quarter]], as the area has come to be dominated by the institutions of the European Union and organisations dealing with them, although the two terms are not in fact the same, with the Leopold Quarter being a smaller more specific area. The Leopold Quarter was traditionally the area immediately south of the [[Small ring (Brussels)|inner ring road]], between the Porte de Namur and Porte de Louvain. Today it lies roughly between the ring road and [[Leopold Park]], and Rue Joseph II/Jozef II Straat and Rue du Trone/Troonstraat.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 30&lt;/ref&gt; The district was created in 1837, named after [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], and covers the areas of the [[List of municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region|municipalities]] of the [[City of Brussels]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Ixelles]] and [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bBFwIGv2qMEC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=leopold+quarter+belgium&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=v6WDTZDdII_ksQP9qLzsAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=leopold%20quarter%20belgium&amp;f=false  ''The West European City'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The area was initially designed and built soon after [[Belgian revolution|Belgian independence]] in the 1830s and 40s and was a prestigious residential area for the elite of the new Belgian capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JHFWj687-6IC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=medieval+brussels+leopold+quarter&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2KmDTe6oHI-asAPd3bXpAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20brussels%20leopold%20quarter&amp;f=false  ''The Globalized City'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It remained the most prestigious residential address in the capital until the early 20th century when many of its former residents began to relocate to Brussels' newly developing suburbs.&lt;ref name=Demey&gt;{{cite book|last=Demey|first=Thierry|title=Brussels, capital of Europe|year=2007|publisher=Badeaux|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at that time, but accelerating rapidly only after the 1950s it became more and more a business/institutional area and is today dominated by facilities  of the European Union.

The quarter contains the [[European Parliament]] (with its building known as the [[Espace Léopold]]) and other [[European Union]] offices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-imH3j7niwgC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=european+parliament+building+brussels&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jKeDTbThG5OssAO977DwAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=european%20parliament%20building%20brussels&amp;f=false  ''Brussels and Europe'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a major financial district of Brussels. The [[Brussels-Luxembourg Station]] was formerly known as the Leopold Quarter station before undergoing major rebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GKQsdi0Va2EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  ''Travel Brussels, Belgium'', Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Place du Luxembourg Panorama 889.jpg|thumb|500px|center|The [[Place du Luxembourg]], with what remains of the old [[Gare du Quartier Léopold]] building centre, and the European Parliament behind. Place du Luxembourg retains some of the more traditional architectural elements of the Quartier Leopold, while the parliamentary complex dominates the now largely institutional area.]]

The area south of the walls of Brussels was largely rural until the 19th century. In the last years of [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian rule]] there were plans mooted to build a new residential district outside of the crowded city walls in the area that became the Leopold Quarter. When the walls were torn down in the wake of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] a plan was adopted to make the area formerly occupied by the walls into a boulevard, which is today the [[Small ring (Brussels)|inner ring road of Brussels]]. In the wake of the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830, the new members of the Belgian upper class hoped to create a new prestigious residential area in the capital. An official plan for the quarter was drawn up by [[Tilman-Francois Suys]] in 1838. The area was designed to emanate from the [[Brussels Park]] located behind the palace. The area was laid out on a grid in a traditional classical pattern. The Leopold Quarter was quickly developed and already had 500 residents by 1847. By 1853 the population had reached 3,212, most property owners or [[landed gentry]] with domestic staff.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Other typical residents included civil servants, military officers, members of liberal professions, embassy staff, and representatives of foreign companies.

A railway station called ''Gare du Quartier Léopold'' was built, along with a large square at the end of Rue de Luxembourg, between 1854–55. The station is today known as [[Brussels-Luxembourg Station]], while the square is still known as [[Luxembourg Square]]. They had not been included in Suys' original plans, as the railroad was a new development in the 1830s in Belgium. Designed by [[Gustave Saintenoy]], the station and the railway came to be a defining feature of the area's geography. In those days the outer edge of the area was defined by the [[Maalbeek]] river valley, but in the 1850s plans were drawn up to build a bridge across it to connect [[Rue de la Loi]] to the new military parade ground on the Linthout Plateau (today [[Parc du Cinquantenaire]]).&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eggevoorde Estate had dominated the Maalbeek Valley since the Middle Ages, but portions had been sold off in the intervening centuries. In 1851 a portion was sold off in exchange for shares in the Zoological and Horticultural Society, and the area became what is today the [[Leopold Park]]. The park was intended to be a home for scientific and leisure activities. Horticultural gardens and a zoo were created along with a community hall, reading room, and a cafe restaurant. However, the zoo was poorly managed and the management company went bankrupt in 1876. The horticultural gardens on the other hand were quite successfully managed by Jean Linden, and they became a commercial and scientific success story until 1898 when it was sold. Brussels bought the old Zoological gardens and it was converted into a public recreational park containing a variety of diversions, including the eventual Natural History Museum. In 1884 [[Ernest Solvay]] and Paul Héger, professors at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] began a project to create an expanded university campus in the park. Several of the university's new institutes were created in the park, and stand to this day, including the original site of the [[Solvay Institute of Sociology]].

The population of the area peaked around 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930 the population had declined by 30%. Railway connections and then the rise in car ownership and allowed the wealthy residents to live further from the city in more open suburbs. The increasingly old fashioned mansions in the area, which were generally designed for use by families with the help of domestic servants became increasingly difficult to maintain. Property developers began to build apartments in the area in the 1920s and increasingly in the 1930s beginning a gradual change in its architectural character.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 428.&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly at first, companies began to purchase unused mansions and adapt them to their use. Then after the [[Second World War]] several Insurance companies and colonial organizations began a trend toward demolishing the 19th century mansions and townhouses, and building new modern office blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; With changes to the road infrastructure of the inner ring road for the [[1958 World's Fair]] the area became even more attractive to companies, located between the administrative centre of Brussels and the residential suburbs further out. With the growing economy, and then the arrival of the European Institutions in the late 1950s, the area became a major target for property developers building office space for institutional and corporate use. Brussels had no development plan, and did not enforce existing legal restrictions, so most remaining residents left during this time as it had become completely transformed from a formerly quiet residential area into a congested centre of transport and business.&lt;ref&gt;Demey, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RdlL East.jpg|right|thumb|The area is today dominated by medium rise office blocks dating from the last 50 years.]]

In 1987 the old Leopold brewery was torn down in anticipation of the construction of what would become [[Espace Léopold]], which was unofficially intended to house the [[European Parliament]]. Political and legal wrangling had continually delayed a final conclusion regarding the unofficial seat for the parliament. However, as Brussels hoped to keep all of the official institutions in Europe, provision was made for the construction of a suitable facility. (See : [[Brussels and the European Union]]) The construction of the massive facility changed the face of the area again, putting the above ground railway tracks of the Leopold Quarter train station below ground and renaming it as the Brussels-Luxembourg station.

'''Mohammed Mohiedin Anis''' (born 1946/47), also known as '''Abu Omar''', is a Syrian businessman and car collector, based in [[Aleppo]]. A March 2017 photograph of him sitting on his bed, smoking a pipe and listening to his wind-up record player in a rubble-strewn room has been widely reproduced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4701247/aleppo-syria-car-collector/ |author=Katz, Andrew|title=The Man on the Bed |website=Time.com |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Anis studied medicine in [[Zaragoza]], Spain, in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Selk |first=Avi |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/14/how-one-mans-pause-became-a-haunting-symbol-of-aleppos-destruction/ |title=How one man’s pause became a haunting symbol of Aleppo’s destruction |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiarioMotor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Álvarez|first1=Sergio|title=A pesar de la destrucción del conflicto, este coleccionista de clásicos de Alepo no ha perdido su pasión|url=http://www.diariomotor.com/noticia/coches-clasicos-siria/|accessdate=15 March 2017|work=DiarioMotor|date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a wealthy textile dye entrepreneur.&lt;ref name=laalo&gt;[http://laalo.net/aleppo-car-lover-aims-to-revive-his-wounded-classics-world/ "Aleppo automotive lover goals to revive his ´wounded´ classics | World"], Laalo.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In the 1970s, he was employed in Italy translating [[Fiat]] car manuals into Arabic.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiarioMotor" /&gt;  Later he went back to Syria and opened a cosmetics factory called "Mila Robinson".&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiarioMotor" /&gt;&lt;ref name=laalo /&gt;

==Car collection==
Anis states that his fascination with classic cars goes back to the 1950 Pontiac that his father drove, and which Anis still owns.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/syrian-car-enthusiasts-30-car-collection-destroyed-in-c-1793278047 |author=
Westbrook, Justin T.| title=Syrian Enthusiast's 30-Car Collection Destroyed In Civil War |website=Jalopnik.com |date=14 March 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first purchase was a 1947 Plymouth.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; His collection now includes dozens of cars from the 1940s and 1950s, and prior to the [[Syrian Civil War]], he had hoped to open a museum in Syria.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; His favourite among his collection is a 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged, that he bought in a 2005 auction.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt; He maintains that "no car collection is complete without at least one Cadillac",&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt; and his collection also includes a [[VW Thing]], a 1955 [[Buick Super]], a 1949 [[Hudson Commodore]], a 1957 [[Mercury Montclair]], a 1958 [[Chevrolet Apache]], a cargo-van bodied [[Citroen 2CV]], a 1947 Plymouth, as well as other vintage Buicks and Cadillacs.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;

Anis's collection of classic cars reached some 30 vehicles, but has slowly dwindled during the war.&lt;ref name="independentcivil"&gt;{{cite news|author=McKernan, Bethan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/aleppo-viral-photograph-old-man-story-behind-syria-civil-war-six-years-mohammed-moheidin-anis-abu-a7630691.html |title=Aleppo man: The story behind the viral photograph symbolising six years of Syrian civil war |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=15 March 2017|accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, he had 24 vintage cars, having lost six to shelling.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35387895 |title=Syrian vintage car collector Abu Omar defies shelling – BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=23 January 2017 |accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent theft of the cars, he removes the steering wheels and seats. During the conflict, his neighbours stopped rebels who wanted to mount an anti-aircraft gun on a 1958 Chevrolet.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;

He had to leave Aleppo for a time at the height of the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–16)|Battle of Aleppo]], and when he returned only 13 cars were left (including his 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged), seven having been impounded by the Syrian police, and 10 either missing or destroyed in the war.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt; In March 2017, Anis estimated that altogether, one-third of the collection had been either destroyed or stolen.&lt;ref name="independentcivil"/&gt; He says, "When one of my cars is hit, it's as if I or one of my relatives has been hit. It's as if they were my children, so I come down to check on them".&lt;ref name="jalopnik1" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Anis lives alone in the formerly rebel-held neighbourhood of al-Shaar in [[Aleppo]], his family having fled due to the war.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; He has eight children with two wives, one in Aleppo, the other in [[Hama]], and would like to leave his cars to his children, two to every boy, one to every girl.&lt;ref name="jalopnik1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=laalo /&gt; He speaks five languages, and likes to smoke a pipe while listening to classical music, and to Syrian singers such as [[Mohamed Dia al-Din]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independentcivil"/&gt;

'''Sir Naim Eliahou Dangoor''', [[CBE]] (April 1914 – 19 November 2015) was a British-naturalised Iraqi-born Jewish entrepreneur and philanthropist.

==Early life ==
He was born in [[Baghdad]] in April 1914, the second of six siblings.  His father Eliahou Dangoor (1883–1976) was the world's largest printer of Arabic books,&lt;ref name=Millman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Millman|first1=Joel|title=Iraq's forgotten exiles seek redress|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/05/iraq.theeditorpressreview|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2014|date=5 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his grandfather [[Ezra Dangoor|Hakham Ezra Reuben Dangoor]] was the [[Chief Rabbi]] of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Iraq's forgotten exiles seek redress|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/05/iraq.theeditorpressreview|work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate = 24 September 2015|first = Joel|last = Millman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Dangoor made the five-day journey from Baghdad to London, at the age of 17, in order to enroll in an engineering degree at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name= IPD&gt;{{Cite web|title = Two Centenarians: Iraq’s First Coke Bottler Shares a Birth Year With the Coca-Cola Bottle|url = https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/260467001/two-centenarians-iraq-s-first-coke-bottler-shares-a-birth-year-with-the-coca-cola-bottle|accessdate = 20 November 2015|author = Jamal Booker}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduating he returned to Iraq where he was conscripted into the army and became an officer. It was during his army training that he met his future business partner Ahmed Safwat.&lt;ref name= IPD/&gt;

==Career ==
Initially on leaving the army he had hoped to become an engineer on the railways, but due to restrictions imposed upon Jews this was not possible, so he and Ahmed, a Muslim, decided to go into business together, setting up Eastern Industries in 1949.

Their first contract was to supply new windows to all Iraqi government buildings, and soon their portfolio grew to include property development and letting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Funding education runs in their family |url = http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/131565/funding-education-runs-their-family|work= [[The Jewish Chronicle]]|date = 12 March 2015|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1950, Eastern industries secured the first contract to bottle [[Coca-Cola]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Two Centenarians: Iraq’s First Coke Bottler Shares a Birth Year With the Coca-Cola Bottle|url = https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/260467001/two-centenarians-iraq-s-first-coke-bottler-shares-a-birth-year-with-the-coca-cola-bottle|accessdate = 24 September 2015|first = IPD|last = Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside Eastern Industries, Dangoor also ran factories producing matches and furniture.

With the founding of the State of Israel and the resulting conflict between Israel and the Arab states, the situation for Jews in the country worsened and in 1959 Dangoor took the difficult decision to take his family out. He continued travelling back and forth for business until 1963, when he decided that the worsening political situation made it too risky for him to return.  As a result of laws specific to Jews, he lost his Iraqi citizenship, and his property and business interests were taken by the government.&lt;ref name="promises"&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Curtis|first1 = Polly|title = Keeping promises|url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/nov/26/accesstouniversity.highereducation|work = [[The Guardian]]|accessdate = 11 June 2014|date = 26 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was eventually permitted to settle in the UK where he set about rebuilding his life, setting up a property business that his four sons went on to join.&lt;ref name="University"&gt;{{cite web|title = Dr Naim Dangoor|url = http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/news/press-releases/2000-2009/2009/12/portal_factory/NPArticle/nparticle.2009-12-08.0519426930/index.html|publisher = [[University of Leicester]]|accessdate = 11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

In November 1947, Dangoor married his cousin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12031574/Sir-Naim-Dangoor-businessman-obituary.html|title=Sir Naim Dangoor, businessman - obituary|date=2015-12-03|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renée Dangoor (who had been crowned [[Miss Iraq]] earlier that year).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dangoor family donates £1.1m to Cancer Research UK|url = http://www.fundraising.co.uk/2010/08/02/dangoor-family-donates-11m-cancer-research-uk/|website = UK Fundraising|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to have four sons.

==Philanthropy  ==
In order to preserve the heritage of the community he had left behind, soon after settling in the UK, he founded a community centre in West [[Kensington]] for new Iraqi Jewish immigrants, and in 1971 began editing and publishing ''The Scribe – Journal of Babylonian Jewry'', with 4000 subscribers in 25 countries which continued to be published for 35 years.&lt;ref name="University" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Scribe – Journal of Babylonian Jewry|url = http://www.dangoor.com/scribe.html|website = www.dangoor.com|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 he revived the title of [[Exilarch]] – an ancient title held by the supreme leader of all the Jewish communities in Babylonia, up until the 13th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EXILARCH – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/exilarch|website = www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate = 24 September 2015|last = electricpulp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 he demanded £12 billion ($20 billion) from Iraq's leaders as compensation for what the Iraqi-Jewish community had lost in Iraq after the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Millman|first1=Joel|title=Iraq's forgotten exiles seek redress|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/05/iraq.theeditorpressreview|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2014|date=5 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his business in the UK grew, he wanted to give back to the country that had taken him in.  In 1980 he set up the Exilarch's Foundation, a charity that has made numerous donations to causes relating to education and health.&lt;ref name = "Funding"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Funding education runs in their family |url = http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/131565/funding-education-runs-their-family|author= Charlotte Oliver|work = [[The Jewish Chronicle]]|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 he created the Dangoor Scholarships to help one thousand undergraduate students who had no family history of further education, at the 1994 Group of universities.&lt;ref name = "Funding"/&gt;

A few years later in 2009 he created the Eliahou Dangoor Scholarships, in honour of his father.  These were awarded to four thousand undergraduate students, with limited means, studying STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects.&lt;ref name = "Funding"/&gt;

In the same year Dangoor was made honorary President for the Association of Jewish Academics from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://iraqijews.awardspace.com/books.html?|title = Association for Jewish Academics from Iraq|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exilarch's Foundation also sponsors the Westminster Academy in West London, whose pupils hail from over 60 countries, many in the Middle East. Dangoor's family have been closely involved with the running of the school and have seen it go from being issued with an Ofsted 'Notice to Improve' in 2009, to being rated as 'Outstanding' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ofsted {{!}} Westminster Academy|url = http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/131262|website = reports.ofsted.gov.uk|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Academy opened the number of students achieving five A*-C GCSE grades including both English and Maths has increased from 17% to 70% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://westminsteracademy.net/documents/September2010.pdf|title = Westminster Academy Documents|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ofsted School Data Dashboard for Westminster Academy|url = http://dashboard.ofsted.gov.uk/dash.php?urn=131262|website = dashboard.ofsted.gov.uk|accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangoor also donated a significant amount to [[Cancer Research UK]] to support their website, in memory of his late wife Renée, who died from breast cancer in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding and Partners|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/utilities/about-cancerhelp-uk/funding-and-partners|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Bar-Ilan University]] in Israel, Dangoor set up the Dangoor Centre for Personalised Medicine in the [[Galilee]], which partners with hospitals to analyse the genetic makeup of individual patients, enabling doctors to implement the most effective treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bar-Ilan University and the British Friends of Bar-Ilan proudly announce the establishment of the Dangoor Center for Personalised Medicine at the University's School of Medicine in the Galilee – British Friends of Bar-Ilan|url = http://www.bfbiu.org/healthcare/bar-ilan-university-british-friends-bar-ilan-proudly-announce-establishment-dangoor-center-personalised-medicine-universitys-school-medicine-galilee/|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 he made the largest gift to the Royal Society of Medicine in its history.  The donation is being used to help support young people from disadvantaged backgrounds who would like to pursue a career in medicine, as well as supporting the society's post-graduate education provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Royal Society of Medicine celebrates £2m donation from Naim Dangoor – RSM press release|url = https://www.rsm.ac.uk/about-us/media-information/2014-media-releases/royal-society-of-medicine-celebrates-2m-donation-from-naim-dangoor.aspx|website = www.rsm.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangoor was also the largest private individual donor to the [[Francis Crick Institute]] in London, Europe's largest biomedical research centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Europe's superlab: Sir Paul's cathedral|url = http://www.nature.com/news/europe-s-superlab-sir-paul-s-cathedral-1.17827|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangoor Walk, a pathway that runs beside the Francis Crick Institute and links Midland Road with Ossulton Street, is named after him.

Through his foundation Dangoor promoted the idea of 'Universal Monotheism' a concept that he believes can bring about unity and create a framework for a global religious ethic.  He has sponsored the setting up of a [http://www.monotheism-biu.org/ centre for Universal Monotheism at Bar-Ilan University] from which he received an honorary doctorate in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bar Ilan University {{!}} Honorary Doctorate Recipients|url = http://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php?id=982&amp;pt=1&amp;pid=35&amp;level=3&amp;cPath=35|website = www1.biu.ac.il|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made contributions to the [[University of Nanjing]] in China, and had a particular interest in China because his late wife Renée was born and grew up in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Which country has 10 Jewish study centres? (And it's not obvious) {{!}} The Jewish Chronicle|url = http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/52356/which-country-has-10-jewish-study-centres-and-its-not-obvious|website = www.thejc.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Nanjing he funded scholarships for the university's Jewish Studies Institute and sponsored an international symposium on monotheism, attended by delegates from all over China, the US, Australia and Israel.  In 2011 he was made a consultant professor of the University of Nanjing in recognition of his contributions.

==Honours ==

'''''Network''''' is a real-time, [[two player]] [[business simulation game]] developed by [[David Mullich]] for the [[Apple II]]  in [[1980 in video gaming|1980]].

==Gameplay==
Two players play competitively against the computer, each taking the role of the programming chief for a major [[television network]].  Each side bids on new television shows to add to the season’s line-up, schedules them, monitors the weekly ratings, and then drops shows with poor ratings or reschedules them to recover from mistakes at the end of the thirteen-week season.  The side with the highest ratings is the winner.

==Reception==
Bruce Webster reviewed ''Network'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=Bruce |date=September 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster commented that "Unfortunately, I just could not get interested in the game. It moves slowly and requires (for intelligent play) that the players keep track of a lot of information that is not always easily accessible. One friend I played against quit out of boredom at one point, and I found myself yawning. There is a lack of tension, which means that personal interest must be the overriding factor in playing the game - and I'm just not that interested in network planning. If you are, then this is the game for you; otherwise, I'm afraid you'll just be disappointed."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

'''Place management''' is the process of making places better. This is practiced through programmes to improve a location or to maintain an already attained desired standard of operation. Place management can be undertaken by private, public or voluntary organisations or a mixture of each. Despite the wide variety of place management initiatives the underlying common factor is usually a desire to maximise the effectiveness of a location for its users, whether they are residents, shoppers, tourists, investors, property developers or business owners.

== Overview ==
Place management is defined by the Institute of Place Management as "a coordinated, area-based, multi-stakeholder approach to improve locations, harnessing the skills, experiences and resources of those in the private, public and voluntary sectors".&lt;ref name=IPM&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Place Management Website|url=http://www.placemanagement.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a conceptual field it remains relatively underdeveloped because of its infancy.

== History ==
Place management has its roots in the [[management]] of towns, cities, neighbourhoods and other locations. The reasons for the need for place management are compelling. The proportion of the world’s population living in cities has grown from 13% in 1900 to nearly 50% now.&lt;ref name="Grimond"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimond|first=J. |title=The World goes to town|journal=The Economist|date=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes particularly in healthcare and technology have led to dramatic shifts in migration practices. Fluctuations in the movement of people places a strain on both urban and rural locations.

Migration is not limited between rural and urban locations but can also happen between countries, creating issues relating to cultural integration. People will migrate for numerous reasons often linked with finding a better quality of life either through superior employment prospects, escaping war or poverty, or even to enjoy a better climate. This can create problems for locations which become exposed to increases in population, decreases in population, or a shift in the demographic composition of a population. Places subsequently act as focal points for the occurrence of phenomena such as [[globalisation]] and the [[clash of civilisations]].

Factors such as changing technology not only drive migration, but can in themselves trouble the prosperity of places. Technological development was a driver behind the [[Industrial Revolution]] which led to high levels of migration into urban locations. However, further technological development rendered many of the primary functions of successful industrial cities as obsolete towards the end of the twentieth century. Grimond cites [[New York City]] as being one city which “went through a bad patch in the 1970s” while other major cities, such as [[Manchester]] in the UK which is famed for instigating the Industrial Revolution, also suffered.&lt;ref name="Grimond"/&gt; Rapid technological and industrial change not only creates jobs but can also cause mass unemployment, damaging local economies and leaving pockets of deprivation across regions.

Another important factor in the development of the field of place management is the impact of the retail sector. As a non-judicial parliamentary review of the UK retail sector states, retailing is a necessity for local populations, supplying food and goods in the absence of self agricultural practices. However, shifts in the sector influenced by national and multi-national companies have led to the globalisation of the sector, which raises concerns about the sustainability of the supply of goods and the effectiveness of local economies. Furthermore, all business practices, either positively or negatively, can impact upon the prosperity of the area it is based through the employment of people, investment and skills retention.

As it now appears to be accepted that for numerous reasons places undergo a process evolution which can impact upon their prosperity, it has become more widely acknowledged that deliberate and co-ordinated intervention in this evolution is desirable. Recognising a symbiotic relationship between the prosperity of a location and the prosperity of retail, firms Boots the Chemist, J Sainsburys and Marks &amp; Spencer in the UK contributed to the development of place management by supporting local authorities in the formation of locally based intervention schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atcm.org/about/what-is-tcm.php Association of Town Centre Management Website]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the appointments of the [[United Kingdom]]'s first town centre managers in [[Ilford]] and the London Borough of Redbridge in 1987. This consequently led to the formation of the Association of Town Centre Management.&lt;ref&gt;Warnaby, G., Alexander, A., Medway, D. (1998), "Town centre management in the UK: a review, synthesis and research agenda", [[The International Review of Retail Distribution and Consumer Research]], Vol. 8 No.1, pp.15-31&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1987 and 2000 around 500 town centre management schemes covering 600 towns and cities dedicated to co-ordinating various functions of a particular location have been established.

Since the 1970s and 1980s, similar intervention schemes were practiced elsewhere under different guises including urban revitalisation in Poland, activity centre management in Australia, and business improvement districts in the US. Despite their differences, as they each embody the aim of improving the effectiveness of a location, the Institute of Place Management has sought to unify them under the banner of ‘place management’ borrowing a term which was originally conceived in Australia.

== Nature ==
Place management has existed for over 20 years in a variety of forms. It is encompassed within the practice of acts including town centre management, urban revitalisation, activity centre management, regeneration, management, marketing, economic development, neighbourhood management, neighbourhood renewal, socio-economic revitalisation, community development and business improvement district management.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, C. 2008. "Extended editorial: place - the trinal frontier" Journal of Place Management and Development, Vol 1 No. 1, pp 5-14&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exist questions about the practical nature of place management because no clear consensus has yet been developed.

Questions include both the positive and normative aspects of place management. The overwhelming amount of variables which impact upon the effectiveness of a location in serving the needs of its users makes it difficult to determine if place management is being practised in a particular location, how it is being practiced and how it should be practiced. A mixture of cultural, societal, demographic, economic, religious, political, legal and technological issues may all play a role. This is problematic for both the academic and the practical determination of place management.

Although this term is relatively new, place management has, in practice, become an established concept over the last twenty years in Europe, having existed in parts of North America for much longer. It is also an emerging concept in other parts of the world such as Asia and Australia. The concept embraces management of a wide range of locations, which may include public and private spaces of various sizes and geographical spaces. Consequently, place management can take a number of forms. Initiatives can be differentiated by the origins of the resources which support it and the degree of formality which underpins the agreement to secure resources from the various funding bodies.

One example is a community-based (bottom-up) approach, where communities or businesses take the initiative of improving their street, town centre, public park or engage actively with NGOs and the voluntary sector. Among many other examples, this approach has been trialled successfully since 1995 by an association of independent retailers in Granollers, Spain where a not-for-profit association was formed which aimed to enhance the local area for residents and consumers, investing revenue in improvements and charitable causes.&lt;ref&gt;Coca-Stefaniak J.A., Parker C., Barbany A., Garrell X. and Segovia E. (2005), Gran Centre Granollers city, culture and commerce, [[The International Review of Retail Distribution and Consumer Research]], Vol.33 No.9&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates an informal place management initiative.

A [[business improvement district]] (BID) is a predominantly private partnership (although it can also encompass some public resources) in which businesses in a defined area elect to pay an additional tax in order to fund improvements to the district's public realm and trading environment. These businesses hope to see a return on their investment through an increase in customer spend within the location. The concept of the BID is believed to have been developed in Canada before spreading to the US and across the globe. Unlike the Granollers example, as a BID is a formal place management initiative because it acts as an additional tax which is legally recognised in many of the areas in which they have been set up.

Contrary to the ‘bottom-up’ approach, many place management schemes have been initially formed publicly by local government, which has provided funding to create the post of a place manager.  Local government is often seen as a natural home for place management initiatives, as its remit will be to obtain a desired standard of living for its residents. However, the additional financial burden or a lack of place management expertise can hamper efforts to locate place management initiatives with local government.

'''''Public Speaking and Influencing Men In Business''''' ({{ISBN|0-7661-6973-1}}) is a [[public speaking]] book written by [[Dale Carnegie]] in 1937 and first published in 1926 as ''Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men'', with several revised editions published later.  Dorothy Carnegie produced 2 separate revised editions:  ''How to Develop Self-Confidence and Influence People by Public Speaking'' (1956), aimed at the general public, and ''The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking'' (1962), as a replacement textbook for the Dale Carnegie Course.  A more recent revised edition is ''Public Speaking for Success'' (2005), revised by Arthur Pell, which restores content that was left out of the Dorothy Carnegie-revised works.

''Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men'', ''Public Speaking and Influencing Men In Business'', and ''The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking'' served as standard textbooks in the Dale Carnegie Course.

The main focus of this book is to present a thorough understanding of the principles of public speaking, as well as guidance into conquering the fears attributed to public speaking.

'''Roll bonding''' is a solid state, [[cold welding]] process, obtained through [[Rolling (metalworking)|flat rolling]] of [[sheet metal]]s. In roll bonding, two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers. The pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the clad material. The mating surfaces must be previously prepared (scratched, cleaned, degreased) in order to increase their friction coefficient and remove any oxide layers.
The process can be performed at room temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bay|first1=N.|last2=Clemensen|first2=C.|last3=Juelstorp|first3=O.|last4=Wanheim|first4=T.|title=Bond Strength in Cold Roll Bonding|journal=CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology|date=January 1985|volume=34|issue=1|pages=221–224|doi=10.1016/S0007-8506(07)61760-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at warm conditions. In warm roll bonding, heat is applied to pre-heat the sheets just before rolling, in order to increase their [[ductility]] and improve the strength of the weld. The strength of the rolled bonds depends on the main process parameters, including the rolling conditions (entry temperature of the sheets, amount of thickness reduction, rolling speed, etc.), the pre-rolling treatment conditions (annealing temperature and time, surface preparation techniques, etc.) and the post-rolling heat treatments.

==Applications==

The applications of roll bonding can be used for [[Cladding_(metalworking)|cladding]] of metal sheets, or as a sub-step of the [[accumulative roll bonding]]. Bonding of the sheets can be controlled by painting a pattern on one sheet; only the bare metal surfaces bond, and the un-bonded portion can be inflated if the sheet is heated and the coating vaporizes. This is used to make [[heat exchanger]]s for refrigeration equipment. &lt;ref name=BRALLA07&gt;Bralla, James G.

'''VALS''' ("Values and Lifestyles")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vals Definition by SRI|url=https://www.sri.com/sites/default/timeline/timeline.php?timeline=business-entertainment#!&amp;innovation=vals-market-research}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proprietary research methodology used for [[psychographic]] [[market segmentation]]. VALS is a way of viewing people on the basis of their attitudes, needs, wants, beliefs and demographics. By using psychology to analyze and predict consumer preferences and choices, the VALS system constructs a link between personality traits and buying behavior.The system identifies current and future opportunities by segmenting the consumer market place on the basis of the personality traits that drive consumer behavior&lt;ref&gt;Raj, Mohan, M. Prasanna, and A. K. Sait. "Psychographic Profiling of Indian Young Adult Consumers of Smartphone-VALS Approach." Management Studies and Economic Systems 2, no. 2 (2015): 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==
VALS was developed in 1978 by social scientist and consumer futurist [[Arnold Mitchell]] and his colleagues at [[SRI International]]. It was immediately embraced by advertising agencies and is currently offered as a product of SRI's consulting services division. VALS draws heavily on the work of Harvard sociologist [[David Riesman]] and psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yankelovich|first=Daniel|title=Rediscovering Market Segmentation|author2=David Meer |journal=Harvard Business Review|date=February 6, 2006|pages=1–11|url=http://www.viewpointlearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/segmentation_0206.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell used statistics to identify attitudinal and [[demographic]] questions that helped categorize adult American consumers into one of nine lifestyle types: survivors (4%), sustainers (7%), belongers (35%), emulators (9%), achievers (22%), I-am-me (5%), experiential (7%), societally conscious (9%), and integrated (2%). The questions were weighted using data developed from a sample of 1,635 Americans and their [[significant other]]s, who responded to an SRI International survey in 1980.&lt;ref name=ACR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beatty|first=Sharon E.|author2=Pamela M. Homer |author3=Lynn R. Kahle |title=Problems With Vals in International Marketing Research: an Example From an Application of the Empirical Mirror Technique|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|year=1988|volume=15|pages=375–380|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/display.asp?id=6655|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main dimensions of the VALS framework are resources (the [[Y-axis|vertical dimension]]) and primary motivation (the [[X-axis|horizontal dimension]]). The vertical dimension segments people based on the degree to which they are [[innovative]] and have resources such as [[income]], [[education]], [[self-confidence]], [[intelligence]], leadership skills, and energy. The horizontal dimension represents primary motivations and includes three distinct types:

* Consumers driven by [[knowledge]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] are motivated primarily by ''[[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]]''. These consumers include groups called Thinkers and Believers.
* Consumers driven by demonstrating success to their peers are motivated primarily by ''achievement''. These consumers include groups referred to as Achievers and Strivers.
* Consumers driven by a desire for [[social]] or [[physical activity]], variety, and risk taking are motivated primarily by ''self-expression''. These consumers include the groups known as Experiencers and Makers.

At the top of the rectangle are the [[Innovator]]s, who have such high resources that they could have any of the three primary motivations. At the bottom of the rectangle are the Survivors, who live complacently and within their means without a strong primary motivation of the types listed above. The VALS Framework gives more details about each of the groups.

==VALS2==
Researchers faced some problems with the VALS method, and in response, SRI developed the VALS2 programme in 1978; additionally, SRI significantly revised it in 1989. VALS2 places less emphasis on activities and interests and more on a psychological base to tap relatively enduring attitudes and values. The VALS2 program has two dimensions. The first dimension, Self-orientation, determines the type of goals and behaviours that individuals will pursue, and refers to patterns of attitudes and activities which help individuals reinforce, sustain, or modify their social self-image. This is a fundamental human need. 

The second dimension, Resources, reflects the ability of individuals to pursue their dominant self-orientation and includes full-range of physical, psychological, demographic, and material means such as self-confidence, interpersonal skills, inventiveness, intelligence, eagerness to buy, money, position, education, etc. According to VALS 2, a consumer purchases certain products and services because the individual is a specific type of person. The purchase is believed to reflect a consumer’s lifestyle, which is a function of self–orientation and resources. 

In 1991, the name VALS2 was switched back to VALS, because of [[brand equity]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VALS™ Survey Help|url=http://ww.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/help.shtml#12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Criticisms==
[[Psychographic]] segmentation has been criticized by well-known public opinion analyst and social scientist [[Daniel Yankelovich]], who says psychographics are "very weak" at predicting people's purchases, making it a "very poor" tool for corporate decision-makers.&lt;ref name=HBR /&gt; 

The VALS Framework has also been criticized as too culturally specific for international use.&lt;ref name=ACR /&gt; 

==VALS Framework and Segment==

The following types correspond to VALS segments of US adults based on two concepts for understanding consumers: primary motivation and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Framework and VALS™ Types|url=http://www.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/ustypes.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Innovators.''''' These consumers are on the leading edge of change, have the highest incomes, and such high self-esteem and abundant resources that they can indulge in any or all self-orientations. They are located above the rectangle. Image is important to them as an expression of taste, [[independence]], and [[Persona|character]]. Their consumer choices are directed toward the "finer things in life."
*'''''Thinkers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by ideals. They are mature, responsible, well-educated professionals. Their [[leisure]] activities center on their homes, but they are well informed about what goes on in the world and are open to new ideas and [[social change]]. They have high incomes but are practical consumers and rational decision makers.
*'''''Believers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by ideals. They are [[conservative]] and predictable consumers who favor local products and established brands. Their lives are centered on [[family]], [[community]], and the nation. They have modest incomes.
*'''''Achievers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by achievement. They are successful work-oriented people who get their satisfaction from their jobs and families. They are [[politically conservative]] and respect authority and the status quo. They favor established products and services that show off their success to their peers.
*'''''Strivers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by achievements. They have values very similar to achievers but have fewer economic, social, and psychological resources. Style is extremely important to them as they strive to emulate people they admire.
*'''''Experiencers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by self-expression. They are the youngest of all the segments, with a median age of 25. They have a lot of energy, which they pour into [[physical exercise]] and social activities. They are avid consumers, spending heavily on clothing, fast-foods, music, and other youthful favorites, with particular emphasis on new products and services.
*'''''Makers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by self-expression. They are practical people who value self-sufficiency. They are focused on the familiar - family, [[employment|work]], and physical recreation - and have little interest in the broader world. As consumers, they appreciate practical and functional products.
*'''''Survivors.''''' These consumers have the lowest incomes. They have too few resources to be included in any consumer self-orientation and are thus located below the rectangle. They are the oldest of all the segments, with a median age of 61. Within their limited means, they tend to be brand-loyal consumers.

===Use of the VALS Framework===
There is little to no evidence of the use of this framework on a wide basis by any other industry other than the ad industry as indicated by SRI on what little it shares on its website (go to the SRI website for more info).

The '''World Car Awards''' (WCOTY) ({{lang-fr|link=no|Prix mondial de la Voiture de l'année}}) is an automobile award selected by a jury of 82 international automotive journalists from 24 countries. Cars considered must be sold in at least five countries, on at least two continents prior to 1 January of the year of the award. The contest was inaugurated in 2003, and officially launched in January 2004. 

This was as a unified award, similar to many of the continent, and nation-specific [[Car of the Year]] awards already given.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcoty.com/media/?release=53&amp;year=2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, awards for performance, green cars, and car design have also been given.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcoty.com/2007/ wcoty.com World Car of the Year Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, an award for luxury design was inaugurated.

The '''Wright Brothers Medal''' was conceived of in 1924 by the Dayton Section of the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]], and the SAE established it in 1927 to recognize individuals who have made notable contributions in the engineering, design, development, or operation of air and space vehicles. The award is based on contributed research papers.&lt;ref name=Significant&gt;{{cite book|title=Significant American and international awards in aviation|author=United States. Navy Dept.
