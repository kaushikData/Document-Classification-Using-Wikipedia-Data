      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">'''Abraham ben Levi Conque''', also spelt '''Konki''' and '''Cuenque''', (born 1648) was a 17th-century rabbi and [[kabbalist]] in [[Hebron]].

==Life==
Swayed by his cabalistic studies, Conque threw himself into the Sabbatean movement around [[Sabbatai Zevi]], and became one of the most earnest apostles of the Messiah. Even the apostasy of Zevi did not shake Conque's belief, and he remained until his death a faithful follower.

Conque traveled, as a collector for the poor [[Old Yishuv|Jews of Eretz Yisrael]], throughout Germany and Russia, and everywhere endeavored to win adherents to the movement. At the request of a friend residing at [[Frankfort-on-the-Main]], he wrote, in 1689, an account of Shabbethai Ẓebi's life, which reveals in the author a peculiar state of mind. The account is full of miracles and prodigies, firmly believed in by Conque. It is referred to in [[Jacob Emden]]'s history of the Shabbethaian movement, "Zot Torat ha-Ḳena'ot."

Conque was also the author of the following works:

*"Abaḳ Soferim" (Dust of Scholars), Amsterdam, 1704, the first part, under the special title of "Em ha-Yeled," comprises homilies on the Pentateuch; the second, "Uggat Reẓafim," contains Biblical interpretations by himself and others; and the third, "Em la-Binah," consists of nineteen sermons. 
*"Minḥat Ḳena'ot" (Offering of Jealousy), a treatise on jealousy. 
*"Abaḳ Derakim" (Dust of Roads), a collection of sermons.

The last two are mentioned by [[Azulai]], who claims to have seen them in manuscript.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Aeternitas''' was the divine [[personification]] of [[eternity]]. She was particularly associated with [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] as a [[Roman virtues|virtue]]&lt;ref&gt;"Virtue" is a conventional label for this class of deities; as Duncan Fishwick has noted in ''Imperial Cult in the Latin West'' (Brill, 1990), pp. 459–460, to call "eternity" a virtue in English may seem strained.&lt;/ref&gt; of the deified [[Roman emperor|emperor]] ''([[divus]])''. The religious maintenance of abstract deities such as Aeternitas was characteristic of official Roman cult from the time of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudians]] to the [[Severan dynasty|Severans]].&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, ''Imperial Cult'', p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the more familiar [[anthropomorphic]] [[List of Roman deities|deities]], Aeternitas and other abstractions were cultivated with sacrifices and [[Roman temple|temples]], both in Rome and in the [[Roman province|provinces]]. The temple of ''Aeternitas [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusta]]'' at Tarraco in [[Roman Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick, ''Imperial Cult'', p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; was pictured on a coin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E.A. Palmer]], ''Studies of the Northern Campus Martius in ancient Rome'' (American Philosophical Society, 1990), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The divinity sometimes appears as ''Aeternitas Imperii'' (the "Eternity of Roman rule"),&lt;ref&gt;Alain Gowing, ''Empire and Memory: The Representation of the Roman Republic in Imperial Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Latin word ''[[imperium]]'' ("command, power") points toward the meaning "empire," the English word derived from it. ''Aeternitas Imperii'' was among the deities who received sacrifices from the [[Arval Brethren]] in a thanksgiving when [[Nero]] survived [[Pisonian conspiracy|conspiracy and attempted assassination]]. New bronze coinage was issued at this time, on which various virtues were represented.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rufus Fears, "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology" ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 895.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeternitas was among the many virtues depicted on coinage issued under [[Vespasian]], [[Titus]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]], and [[Septimius Severus]].&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," pp. 900–901.&lt;/ref&gt; The coins issued 75–79 AD under Vespasian show Aeternitas holding a head in each hand representing [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]] and [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]].&lt;ref&gt;Raffaele Pettazzoni, ''Essays on the History of Religions'' (Brill, 1967), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; On the coins of Titus (80–81 AD), Aeternitas holds a [[cornucopia]], leans on a [[scepter]], and has one foot placed on a globe, imagery that links the concepts of eternity, prosperity, and world dominion. From the 2nd to the mid-3rd century, the iconography of Aeternitas includes the globe, celestial bodies (stars, or sun and moon), and the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], a symbol of cyclical time, since the phoenix was reborn in flames every 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Barden Dowling, "A Time to Regender: The Transformation of Roman Time," in ''Time and Uncertainty'' (Brill, 2004), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Aeternitas sometimes holds the globe on which the phoenix perches.&lt;ref&gt;Ittai Gradel, ''Emperor Worship and Roman Religion'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'', [[Martianus Capella]] says that Aeternitas is among the more honored of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]'s daughters. He mentions her [[diadem]], the circular shape of which represents eternity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]], ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'' 1.4.13; Danuta Shanzer, ''A Philosophical and Literary Commentary on Martanus Capella's'' De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercuri'' Book 1'' (University of California Press, 1986), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The male equivalent of Aeternitas is [[Aion (deity)|Aion]], the god of unbound time, the celestial spheres, and the Zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Gradel, ''Emperor Worship and Roman Religion'', pp. 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aius Locutius''' ({{lang-lat|āius locūtius}}, spoken affirmation) or '''Aius Loquens''' ({{lang-lat|āius loquens}}, speaking affirmation), was a [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[List of Roman deities|deity]] or [[numen]] associated with the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic invasions]] of Rome during the early 4th century BC.

According to [[Roman mythology|legend]], a Roman [[plebs|plebeian]] named M. Caedicius heard a supernatural, nocturnal voice that issued from [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta's]] sacred grove, at the base of the [[Palatine hill]]. It warned him of an imminent Gaulish attack, recommended that the walls of Rome be fortified and instructed him to pass these messages on to the [[Tribune#Plebeian tribune|tribune of the plebs]]; but because of the messenger's humble station, the message was ignored. In consequence, the Gauls entered and burned the city (c. 391&amp;nbsp;BC). Once the Gauls were repelled, the senate built a temple and altar (known as ''Ara Aius Locutius'' or ''Ara Saepta'') to propitiate the unknown deity who had offered the warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=William|title=A Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography|date=1904|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYQcdGKV9psC&amp;lpg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was said to have been set up where Caedicius had heard the divine voice. Later Roman historians disputed its exact location and no trace remains of the temple or altar; the latter has been historically misidentified with the Palatine altar inscribed ''[[si deus si dea]]'' ("whether god or goddess"), in cautious dedication to some unknown deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=L.|title=A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|date=1992|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;lpg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alvar, Jaime, “Matériaux Pour L'étude De La Formule Sive Deus, Sive Dea.” ''Numen'', vol. 32, no. 2, 1985, pp. 236–273, [[JSTOR]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269812]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the broad context of official [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], Aius Locutius is exceptional. Officially, the gods might speak through the cryptic writings and utterances of specialised [[oracles]], or through a complex system of signs in answer to the specific questions of State [[augurs]]. They might also grant signs of fortune to their most favoured protégés, or speak privately to them in dreams. Aius Locutius gave clear, urgent instructions of great importance to the State, in a voice "clearer than human", but in everyday Latin, to an ordinary plebeian passer-by. Thereafter, according to [[Cicero]], "having acquired a temple, an altar, and a name, 'Speaker' never spoke again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ando|first1=Clifford|title=The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmQkvj9qdXkC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=rome%20iuvenes%20young%20men&amp;pg=PA125#v=onepage&amp;q=locutius&amp;f=false}} Author's paraphrasis of Cicero, ''De divinatione'', 2.69.&lt;/ref&gt; As a trained augur, Cicero was obliged to successfully identify and expiate any prodigies, including such "divine noise" that might signal imminent disaster or divine discontent. Beard (2012) places Aius Locutius at the "extraordinary limit" of such sounds, for the unequivocal clarity of the warning, and the consequences of its rejection by Roman authorities; a god "defined by his voice alone".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], "Cicero's 'Response of the haruspices' and the Voice of the Gods", pp. 28-29 in ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 102 (2012), pp. 20-39, Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, available at [[JSTOR]] [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41724964] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The epithet ''Locutius'' was also used to invoke one of the [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deities concerned with child development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rüpke|first1=Jörg|title=Religion in Republican Rome: Rationalization and Ritual Change|date=2002|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amrita Pritam''' {{audio|Amrita Pritam pronunciation.ogg|listen}} (31 August 1919&amp;nbsp;– 31 October 2005) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] writer and poet, who wrote in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name=lang/&gt; She is considered the first prominent woman [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] poet, novelist, and essayist, and the leading 20th-century poet of the [[Punjabi language]], who is equally loved on both sides of the India-Pakistan border. With a career spanning over six decades, she produced over 100 books of poetry, fiction, biographies, essays, a collection of Punjabi folk songs and an autobiography that were translated into several Indian and foreign languages.&lt;ref name=guar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005%5C11%5C14%5Cstory_14-11-2005_pg7_43 Amrita Pritam: A great wordsmith in Punjab’s literary history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619074153/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2005%5C11%5C14%5Cstory_14-11-2005_pg7_43 |date=19 June 2006 }} ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)]]'', 14 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

She is most remembered for her poignant poem, ''[[Ajj aakhaan Waris Shah nu]]'' (Today I invoke Waris Shah – "Ode to Waris Shah"), an [[elegy]] to the 18th-century Punjabi poet, an expression of her anguish over massacres during the [[partition of India]]. As a novelist, her most noted work was ''[[Pinjar (novel)|Pinjar]]'' (The Skeleton) (1950), in which she created her memorable character, ''Puro'', an [[epitome]] of violence against women, loss of humanity and ultimate surrender to [[Existentialism|existential]] fate; the novel was made into an award-winning film, ''[[Pinjar (film)|Pinjar]]'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051105/saturday/main1.htm Always Amrita, Always Pritam] ''Gulzar Singh Sandhu on the Grand Dame of Punjabi letters'', ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'', 5 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0347779|Pinjar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the former [[British India]] was partitioned into the independent states of India and Pakistan in 1947, she migrated from [[Lahore]], to India, though she remained equally popular in Pakistan throughout her life, as compared to her contemporaries like [[Mohan Singh (poet)|Mohan Singh]] and [[Shiv Kumar Batalvi]].

Known as the most important voice for the women in [[Punjabi literature]], in 1956, she became the first woman to win the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] for her [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], a long poem, ''Sunehade'' (Messages),&lt;ref name=mod&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;pg=PA945&amp;dq=Amrita+Pritam&amp;sig=ACfU3U0CpuZGiTYdM4_fgX4dsZaextbNnA#PPA945,M1 Amrita Pritam] ''Modern Indian Literature: an Anthology'', by K. M. George, [[Sahitya Akademi]]. 1992, {{ISBN|81-7201-324-8}}.''945–947''.&lt;/ref&gt; later she received the [[Jnanpith Award|Bharatiya Jnanpith]], one of India's highest literary awards, in 1982 for ''Kagaz Te Canvas'' (The Paper and the Canvas). The [[Padma Shri]] came her way in 1969 and finally, [[Padma Vibhushan]], India's second highest civilian award, in 2004, and in the same year she was honoured with India's highest literary award, given by the [[Sahitya Akademi]] (India's Academy of Letters), the [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]] given to ''the "immortals of literature"'' for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/10/05/stories/2004100514031300.htm Sahitya Akademi fellowship for Amrita Pritam, Anantha Murthy] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 5 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Background===
Amrita Pritam was born as Amrit Kaur in 1919 in [[Gujranwala]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], in present-day Pakistan,&lt;ref name=guar&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/nov/04/guardianobituaries.india Amrita Pritam – Obituary] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 4 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; the only child of Raj Bibi, who was a school teacher and Kartar Singh Hitkari, who was a poet, a scholar of [[Braj Bhasha]], and the editor edited a literary journal.&lt;ref name=wom/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=Amrita+Pritam&amp;sig=ACfU3U1QKgR3CqBR6Vw_eBNoNj5e38LdYw#PPA254,M1 New Panjabi Poetry ( 1935–47)] ''Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India'', by Nalini Natarajan, Emmanuel Sampath Nelson, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996. {{ISBN|0-313-28778-3}}.''Page 253-254''.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, he was a ''pracharak''&amp;nbsp;– a preacher of the Sikh faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhtimes.com/bios_111205a.html Kushwant Singh, "Amrita Pritam: Queen of Punjabi Literature", ''The Sikh Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; Amrita's mother died when she was eleven. Soon after, she and her father moved to [[Lahore]], where she lived till her migration to India in 1947. Confronting adult responsibilities, and besieged by loneliness following her mother's death, she began to write at an early age. Her first anthology of poems, ''Amrit Lehran'' (Immortal Waves) was published in 1936, at age sixteen, the year she married Pritam Singh, an editor to whom she was engaged in early childhood, and changed her name from Amrita Kaur to Amrita Pritam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/amrita-pritam-513564.html Amrita Pritam – Obituary] ''[[The Independent]]'', 2 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Half a dozen collections of poems were to follow between 1936 and 1943.

Though she began her journey as romantic poet, soon she shifted gears,&lt;ref name=mod/&gt; and became part of the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]] and its effect was seen in her collection, ''Lok Peed'' (People's Anguish) (1944), which openly criticized the war-torn economy, after the [[Bengal famine of 1943]]. She was also involved in social work to certain extent and participated in such activities wholeheartedly, after Independence when social activist [[Guru Radha Kishan]] took the initiative to bring the first Janta Library in Delhi, which was inaugurated by Balraj Sahni and Aruna Asaf Ali and contributed to the occasion accordingly.

Renowned theatre person and the director of the immortal partition movie 'Garam Hava', [[MS Sathyu]] paid a theatrical tribute to her through the rare theatrical performance 'Ek Thee Amrita'.

===Partition of British India===
Some one million people, [[Muslims]], [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikhs]] died from communal violence that followed the partition of British India in 1947, and left Amrita Pritam a Punjabi refugee at age 28, when she left [[Lahore]] and moved to New Delhi. Subsequently, in 1948, while she was pregnant with her son, and travelling from [[Dehradun]] to [[Delhi]], she expressed anguish on a piece of paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/lr/2005/12/04/stories/2005120400040100.htm An alternative voice of history] Nonica Datta, [[The Hindu]], 4 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; as the poem, "[[Ajj akhaan Waris Shah nu]]" (I ask Waris Shah Today); this poem was to later immortalise her and become the most poignant reminder of the horrors of Partition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2005/11/13/stories/2005111300030100.htm Juggling two lives] [[The Hindu]], 13 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem addressed to the Sufi poet [[Waris Shah]], author of the tragic saga of [[Heer Ranjha|Heer and Ranjah]] and with whom she shares her birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.apnaorg.com/poetry/heercomp/ Complete Heer Waris Shah]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amrita Pritam worked until 1961 in the Punjabi service of [[All India Radio]], Delhi. After her divorce in 1960, her work became more clearly feminist. Many of her stories and poems drew on the unhappy experience of her marriage. A number of her works have been translated into English, French, [[Danish language|Danish]], Japanese, Mandarin and other languages from [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Urdu]], including her autobiographical works ''Black Rose'' and ''Rasidi Ticket'' (Revenue Stamp).

The first of Amrita Pritam's books to be filmed was Dharti Sagar te Sippiyan, as ‘Kadambari’ (1965), followed by ‘Unah Di Kahani’, as ''Daaku'' ([[Dacoit]], 1976), directed by [[Basu Bhattacharya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhtimes.com/news_082702a.html Jeevan Prakash Sharma, "Amrita Pritam's Novel to Be Rendered on Film", ''The Hindustan Times'' (August 27, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; Her novel ''[[Pinjar (novel)|Pinjar]]'' (The Skeleton, 1970) narrates the story of partition riots along with the crisis of women who suffered during the times. It was made into an [[Filmfare Best Art Direction|award-winning]] [[Pinjar (film)|Hindi movie]] by [[Chandra Prakash Dwivedi]], because of its [[humanism]]: "Amritaji has portrayed the suffering of people of both the countries." ''Pinjar'' was shot in a border region of [[Rajasthan]] and in Punjab.

She edited "Nagmani", a monthly literary magazine in Punjabi for several years, which she ran together with Imroz, for 33 years; though after Partition she wrote prolifically in Hindi as well.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pustak.org/bs/home.php?author_name=Amrita+Pritam|title=Amrita Pritam/अमृता प्रीतम|author=|date=|website=www.pustak.org|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, she turned to [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]] and wrote introductions for several books of Osho, including ''Ek Onkar Satnam'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sannyasworld.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=627 A tribute to Amrita Pritam by Osho lovers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716003659/http://www.sannyasworld.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=627 |date=16 July 2011 }} ''Sw.

==Personal life==
In 1935, Amrita married Pritam Singh, son of a leading hosiery merchant of Lahore's Anarkali bazaar. In 1960, Amrita Pritam left her husband. She is also said to have an unrequited affection for poet [[Sahir Ludhianvi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upperstall.com/people/sahir-ludhianvi Sahir Biography] ''[[Upperstall.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of this love is depicted in her autobiography, ''Rasidi Ticket'' (Revenue Stamp). When another woman, singer [[Sudha Malhotra]] came into Sahir's life, Amrita found solace in the companionship of the renowned artist and writer Imroz. She spent the last forty years of her life with Imroz, who also designed most of her book covers and made her the subject of his several paintings. Their life together is also the subject of a book, ''Amrita Imroz: A Love Story''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://passionforcinema.com/amrita-preetam-imroz-a-love-story-of-a-poet-and-a-painter/ Amrita Preetam Imroz : A love Story of a Poet and a Painter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108032205/http://passionforcinema.com/amrita-preetam-imroz-a-love-story-of-a-poet-and-a-painter/ |date=8 January 2010 }} Passionforcinema.com, 8 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20061105/spectrum/book4.htm Nirupama Dutt, "A Love Legend of Our Times"] ''[[Tribune]]'', 5 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johnchrysostom.jpg|right|thumb|St. [[John Chrysostom]]&lt;br&gt;Archbishop of Constantinople (398–404)]]
In [[Christianity]], an '''archbishop''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑr|tʃ|ˈ|b|ɪ|ʃ|ə|p}}, via [[Latin]] ''archiepiscopus'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αρχιεπίσκοπος}}, from {{lang|grc|αρχι}}-, 'chief', and {{lang|grc|επίσκοπος}}, 'bishop')&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)rxiepi/skopos|ἀρχιεπίσκοπος}}, {{LSJ|e)pi/skopos1|ἐπίσκοπος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|archiepiscopus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=archbishop|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=archbishop&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bishop]] of higher rank or office. In some cases, such as the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of England]], the title is borne by the leader of the denomination. Like [[pope]]s, [[patriarch]]s, [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]], [[cardinal bishop]]s, [[diocesan bishop]]s, and [[suffragan bishop]]s, archbishops are in the highest of the three traditional [[Holy Orders|orders]] of bishops, [[priest#In Christianity|priests]] (also called [[presbyter]]s), and [[deacon]]s. An archbishop may be granted the title or [[ordination|ordained]] as chief pastor of a [[metropolitan see]] or  another [[episcopal see]] to which the title of archbishop is attached.

==Western Christianity==
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}

===Metropolitan archbishops===
{{Main|Metropolitan bishop}}
{{See also|Diocesan bishop}}
Episcopal sees are generally arranged in groups in which one see's bishop has certain powers and duties of oversight over the others. He is known as the metropolitan archbishop of that see. In the [[Catholic Church]], [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1I.HTM canon 436 of the Code of Canon Law] indicates what these powers and duties are for a [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] metropolitan archbishop, while those of the head of an autonomous (''[[sui iuris]]'') [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] are indicated in [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0758/_PJ.HTM canon 157] of the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]].

===Non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees===
As well as the much more numerous metropolitan sees, there are 77 Roman Catholic sees that have archiepiscopal rank.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annuario Pontificio]] 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p. 1142&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such a see is the only one in a country, such as [[Luxembourg]]&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012, 423&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Monaco]],&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012, p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; too small to be divided into several dioceses so as to form an ecclesiastical province. In others, the title of archdiocese is for historical reasons attributed to a see that was once of greater importance.

Some of these archdioceses are [[suffragan diocese|suffragans]] of a metropolitan archdiocese; examples are the [[Archdiocese of Avignon]], which is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Marseille]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/davig.html Catholic-hierarchy.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Archdiocese of Trnava]], [[Slovakia]]. Others are immediately subject to the Holy See and not to any metropolitan archdiocese. These are usually "aggregated" to an ecclesiastical province. An example is the [[Archdiocese of Hobart]] in [[Australia]], {{em| associated}} with the Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Melbourne|ecclesiastical province of Melbourne]], but not {{em|part}} of it.&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordinary of such an archdiocese is an archbishop; however, especially in the [[Anglican Communion]], not all archbishops' dioceses are called archdioceses.

===Coadjutor archbishops===
{{Main|Coadjutor bishop}}
Until 1970, a coadjutor archbishop, one who has special faculties and the right to succeed to the leadership of a see on the death or resignation of the incumbent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1E.HTM Canon 403 §3 of the Code of Canon Law]&lt;/ref&gt; was assigned also to a titular see, which he held until the moment of succession. Since then, the title of Coadjutor Archbishop of the see is considered sufficient and more appropriate.

===Archbishops ''ad personam''===
The rank of archbishop is conferred on some bishops who are not ordinaries of an archdiocese. They hold the rank not because of the see that they head but because it has been granted to them personally (''ad personam''). Such a grant can be given when someone who already holds the rank of archbishop is transferred to a see that, though its present-day importance may be greater than the person's former see, is not archiepiscopal. The bishop transferred is then known as the Archbishop-Bishop of his new see. An example is [[Gianfranco Gardin]], appointed Archbishop-Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Treviso|Treviso]] on 21 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ofmconv.pcn.net/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=294:naming-of-the-archbishop-bishop-of-treviso-italy&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=87 Naming of the Archbishop-Bishop of Treviso, Italy – Friars Minor Conventual]&lt;/ref&gt; The title borne by the successor of such an archbishop-bishop is merely that of Bishop of the see, unless he also is granted the personal title of Archbishop.

===Titular archiepiscopal sees===
The distinction between metropolitan sees and non-metropolitan archiepiscopal sees exists for [[titular see]]s as well as for residential ones. The ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' marks titular sees of the former class with the abbreviation ''Metr.'' and the others with ''Arciv.''&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012, p. 819&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the titular sees to which [[nuncio]]s and heads of departments of the Roman Curia who are not cardinals are assigned are not of archiepiscopal rank. In that case the person who is appointed to such a position is given the personal title of archbishop (''ad personam''). They are usually referred to as Archbishop of the see, not as its Archbishop-Bishop.

===Archbishops emeriti===
If an archbishop resigns his see without being transferred to another, as in the case of retirement or assignment to head a department of the [[Roman Curia]], the word ''[[emeritus]]'' is added to his former title, and he is called Archbishop Emeritus of his former see. Until 1970, such archbishops were transferred to a titular see.

There can be several Archbishops Emeriti of the same see: The 2008 ''Annuario Pontificio'' listed three living Archbishops Emeriti of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Taipei|Taipei]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'' 2008, p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no Archbishop Emeritus of a titular see: An archbishop who holds a titular see keeps it until death or until transferred to another see. 

In the [[Anglican Communion]], retired archbishops formally revert to being addressed as "bishop" and styled "The Right Reverend",&lt;ref&gt;See note 3 at "Addressing the Clergy" on the [https://www.churchofengland.org/contact-us/addressingtheclergy.aspx Church of England website].&lt;/ref&gt; although they may be appointed "archbishop emeritus" by their province on retirement, in which case they retain the title "archbishop" and the style "The Most Reverend", as a right.&lt;ref&gt;See the example of [http://anglicancentre.churchinsight.com/Groups/199808/Anglican_Centre_in/Contacts_Our_story/Director_and_Staff/The_Director_Archbishop/The_Director_Archbishop.aspx Archbishop David Moxon], for example.&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] is a prominent example, as Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town. Former archbishops who have not received the status of archbishop emeritus may still be informally addressed as "archbishop" as a courtesy,&lt;ref&gt;See "How to address the Clergy" in [http://www.crockford.org.uk/standard.asp?id=116 Crockford Clerical Directory, section "Archbishops", subsection "Notes".]&lt;/ref&gt; unless they are subsequently appointed to a bishopric (not an {{em|arch}}bishopric), in which case, the courtesy ceases.&lt;ref&gt;See final notes on the Archbishops page of [http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/professions/religion/church-england/other-archbishops-anglican-communion-wales-armagh Debretts] forms of address.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no difference between the official dress of archbishops, as such, and that of other bishops, Roman Catholic metropolitan archbishops are distinguished by the use in liturgical ceremonies of the [[pallium]], but only within the province over which they have oversight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1I.HTM Canon 437 of the Code of Canon Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic bishops and archbishops are styled "The Most Reverend" and addressed as "Your Excellency" in most cases. In [[English-speaking]] countries (except the United States), a Catholic archbishop is addressed as "Your Grace", while a Catholic bishop is addressed as "Your Lordship". Before December 12, 1930, the title "Most Reverend" was only for archbishops, while bishops were styled as "Right Reverend".&lt;ref&gt;''Canon Law Digest,'' Bouscaren, Vol. 1, Page 20.

[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore]]. Retrieved on 2016-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is still followed by Catholic bishops in the [[United Kingdom]] to mirror that of the [[Church of England]].

In Roman Catholic [[Ecclesiastical heraldry|heraldry]], an archbishop has an ecclesiastical hat with ten tassels on each side of his [[coat of arms]], while a bishop has only six. The archiepiscopal cross behind the shield has two bars instead of one. Such a cross may be borne before him in liturgical processions.

In processions and other occasions where strict protocol is observed, archbishops are ranked higher than [[diocesan bishop]]s in the [[Order of precedence in the Catholic Church|order of precedence]].

In the [[Anglican Communion]], archbishops are styled "The Most Reverend" and addressed as "Your Grace", while bishops are styled "The Right Reverend" and addressed as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship". (In some countries, this usage is followed also by the Roman Catholic Church, but in others no distinction is made and "The Most Reverend" and "Your Excellency" are used for archbishops and bishops alike.) Anglican archbishops are entitled to be preceded by a server carrying an archiepiscopal processional cross (with two bars instead of one) in liturgical processions.&lt;ref&gt;This Anglican [http://library.episcopalchurch.org/gallery/episcopal-news-service-archives?page=2#content news agency page] has photographs of two-barred crosses being carried by Archbishop George Carey and by Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s metropolitical processional cross is always carried before him by a priest-chaplain, and (like other archbishops) is a two-barred processional cross. However, the Archbishop of Canterbury is also entitled to be preceded by the ancient primatial cross of Canterbury (still in ceremonial use) which is of an ornate historical design, made of precious metal, and with precious stones inserted, but unlike his metropolitical cross (or those of other archbishops) it is not double-barred.&lt;ref&gt;The primatial cross is illustrated at the [http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2315 London SE1] community website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Christianity==
[[File:Archbishop Christodoulos Greece.jpg|upright|thumb|Archbishop [[Christodoulos of Athens]] and All Greece (1998–2008)]]
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek tradition]], the title of archbishop usually indicates some form of leadership of the other bishops of the local church (who may be metropolitans), as in the [[Church of Greece]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] tradition, metropolitans outrank archbishops.

The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] custom generally agrees with the Slavic rather than the Greek with respect to the archbishop/metropolitan distinction.

Instead of the term ''archbishop'', [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] sometimes use the word ''archeparch'' by analogy with ''eparch'', the term used for a diocesan (or eparchial) bishop. However, the word ''archeparch'' is not found in the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0758/_FA2.HTM Index of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arruns Tarquinius''', commonly called '''Egerius''', was a member of the royal family of early Rome.

His father was [[Arruns Tarquinius (son of Demaratus)|Arruns Tarquinius]], son of [[Demaratus of Corinth]].  Demaratus had settled at [[Tarquinii]] during the seventh century BC, and married an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] noblewoman.  They had two sons, Lucius and Arruns.  Arruns died shortly before his father, leaving his wife pregnant.  Not knowing of his grandson, Demaratus left him no inheritance, and so Arruns was born into poverty despite his grandfather's wealth.  For this reason, the child was called ''Egerius'', meaning "the needy one."&lt;ref&gt;Livy, i. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGRBM Tarquinius"&gt;''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 976 ("Tarquinius").&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of his wife, [[Tanaquil]], Lucius Tarquinius migrated to Rome, where he found favour with the king, [[Ancus Marcius]].  Ultimately, Tarquin succeeded Marcius as the fifth [[King of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, i. 34, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  After subduing the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] town of [[Collatia]], Tarquin placed his nephew in command of the Roman garrison there.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, i. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGRBM Tarquinius"/&gt;

Arruns' son was [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], one of the first [[Roman consul]]s in 509 BC.  The rape of Collatinus' wife, [[Lucretia]], by his cousin, [[Sextus Tarquinius]], was the event that sparked the expulsion of the Roman kings.  Ironically, public hatred of the Tarquins led Collatinus himself to resign the consulship and go into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, i. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGRBM Tarquinius"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lucretia |volume=17 |page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4615">The '''Baishatun Mazu Pilgrimage''' ({{zh|t=白沙屯媽祖進香|p=Báishātún Māzǔ jìnxiāng}}) usually holds between [[Chinese calendar|lunar]] January and April annually in western plain of [[Taiwan]], which was a big [[Taoism|Taoist]] folk event since 1863. After every lunar new year, the Mazu statue of Gongtian Temple (Chinese:拱天宮) at Baishatun, [[Tongxiao, Miaoli|Tongxiao]] of [[Miaoli County]], it sits in the palanquin to visit another Mazu Temple- [[Chaotian Temple]] (Chinese: 朝天宮), where is at [[Beigang, Yunlin|Beigang]] of [[Yunlin County]], then returns to Gongtian Temple as ending this pilgrimage, the distance is approximately 400 KM totally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taiwangods.com/html/landscape/1_0011.aspx?i=34|title=白沙屯媽祖徒步進香|last=|first=|date=|website=臺灣宗教百景|language=zh-tw|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another Mazu statue, called as "Mazu the Mountain Side (Chinese:山邊媽祖; pinyin: ''Shān-biān māzǔ'')", who is from [[Houlong|Houlong Township]] (Chinese:後龍鎮) of Miaoli county would accompany Baishatun Mazu finishing the pilgrimage as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bobee.nownews.com/20180517-21541?state=news|title=就是要一起走　山邊媽與白沙屯媽的百年情誼|last=|first=|date=2018-05-27|website=Boobee Now|language=zh-tw|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feature ==
[[Mazu]], also spell as "Matsu", known as a sea goddness for blessing the fishermen and safe journey during the sailing, there are a lot of believers in Taiwan because of her mercy image. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://think.folklore.tw/posts/378|title=臺灣人為何瘋媽祖？媽祖文化隱含著母親意象|last=Lin|first=Maoxian|date=2016-03-20|website=民俗亂彈|language=zh-tw|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;So, Mazu pilgrimage is one of the popular religious activities in Taiwan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

During the whole pilgrimage, Mazu's palanquin carriers go forward only on foot, many pilgrims would follow the steps of Mazu's palanquin, the most traditional way is following by walking, but still plenty of the pilgrims would by scooters, cars, or bicycles. Moreover, the duration and route of Baishatun pilgrimage are not the same in the different year, such as 6 days 5 nights in 2009, or there were 12 days 11 nights in 2017, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baishatun.com.tw/30/2004-2020.htm|title=白沙屯媽祖婆網站|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=zh-tw|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most unique feature of Baishatun pilgrimage is the route. No matter what the way of departing or returning, the route is unpredictable in advance.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.storm.mg/lifestyle/426292|title=沒固定路線、全憑神轎指引徒步400里…白沙屯媽祖進香有何秘密？他爆出這些「神蹟」超驚奇|last=|first=|date=2018-04-19|work=The Storm Media|access-date=2018-05-23|language=zh-tw}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Mazu's palanquin carriers, they said they could feel Mazu's will and indicated them where was the next direction or where to stop while they were walking, pilgrims only know the location of origin and destination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, people regard the Baishatun Mazu Pilgrimage as the most challenge one in Taiwan.

{{BuddhasHolySites}}
'''Bava Pyara caves''' (also known as '''Baba Pyara caves''') are an example of ancient man-made [[caverns]]. The caves are a part of the [[Junagadh Buddhist Cave Groups]] situated in the eastern part of [[Junagadh]] of the [[India]]n state of [[Gujarat]]. Bava Pyara caves contains artworks of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

== Caves ==
These caves are arranged in three lines; the first line on the north facing southwards, the second line on the south from the east end of the first line and the third line runs back of the second line in west-north-west. The second line has primitive flat-roofed ''chaitya'' cave having simple cells on the either side of it with extra cells on the north and east of it.&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941" /&gt;

The Bava Pyara caves were visited by [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]], an English archaeologist and founder of [[The Indian Antiquary]]. He concluded that they were affiliated with both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. According to Burgess these caves were initially built for Buddhists [[bhikkhus]] and were in a later period occupied by Jain ascetics. He was not certain about the exact age of the ancient caves. One fragmentary inscription was found in Bava Pyara cave that affirms its affiliation to Jainism, because one term in that inscription is exclusively used by Jains. The inscription was read as "केवलज्ञान संप्राप्तानां जीतजरामरणानां ".&lt;ref name="Sankalia1941" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aspects of Jaina art and architecture, Umakant Premanand Shah, Madhusudan A. Dhaky Gujarat State Committee for the Celebration of 2500th Anniversary of Bhagavān Mahāvīra Nirvāna : distributors, L.D. Institute of Indology, 1975, page no. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the Oriental Institute'', Volume 49, page no. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''kevalgyan'' was used exclusively by Jains. Scholar H. D. Sankalia attributes these caves to Jainism because of some auspicious symbols typical of Jainism that are depicted above the door's frame. Sankalia recorded about eleven auspicious symbols, "Nandhyavarta", "[[Swastika]]", "Darpan", "Bhadrasana", "Meen Yugal"  and "Purna Ghata". Such symbols were also found on Ayagpattas from Kankali Teela [[Mathura]]. About five such symbols are found in another cave of Bava pyara Caves. These symbols are in a bad state and not recorded, although they were identified as Darpan, Meen Yugal, Purna Ghat, Meen Yugal, Darpan. On a small entrance of one of the caves in the second row at the south end are two symbols depicting [[Yali (mythology)|Vyala]] figures. Burgess and Sanklia failed to notice them. According to [[Madhusudan Dhaky]], on the basis of the Vyala figure, the Bava pyara cave is from the 2nd or 3rd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Aspects of Jaina art and architecture, Umakant Premanand Shah, Madhusudan A.

'''[[Buddhism]]''' is practiced throughout '''[[Central America]]'''. Buddhism's presence in the region was primarily driven by the presence of Chinese immigrant workers during the early 19th century. Presently, Buddhism in the region is primarily of the [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] schools, with many countries in the region having several Buddhist temples, schools, and meditation centers. &lt;ref name="Buddhanet: Central America"&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.info/wbd/region.php?region_id=2 Buddhanet: Central America]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian views on divorce''' find their basis both in biblical sources dating to the [[Mosaic law|giving of the law]] to [[Moses]] ({{bibleref|Deut|24:1-4}}) and political developments in the Christian world long after [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|standardization of the Bible]]. According to the [[synoptic Gospels]], [[Jesus]] emphasized the permanence of [[marriage]], (see [[Mark 10]] at verses 1 to 9,  [[Matthew 19]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Matthew-Chapter-19_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible.

In the book of Matthew Jesus says "Because of your hardness of heart [[Moses]] allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.  And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits [[adultery]]".&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{bibleref2|Matthew|5:31-32}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|19:3-9}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|10:2-12}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|16:18}}, see also [[Expounding of the Law#Divorce]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both in the Gospel of Matthew and of Mark, Jesus remembers and quotes Genesis 1:27 ("male and female created He them")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-1_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible.

[[Paul the Apostle]] concurred but added an exception, known as the [[Pauline privilege]]. 

The Catholic Church prohibits divorce, and permits [[annulment]] (a finding that the marriage was like it has been never celebrated and so was never valid) under a narrow set of circumstances.{{fact|date=June 2015}} The Eastern Orthodox Church permits divorce and remarriage in church in certain circumstances,&lt;ref name="ware"&gt;See Timothy (now Archbishop Kalistos) Ware, [http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/history_timothy_ware_2.htm#n5 ''The Orthodox Church'']&lt;/ref&gt; though its rules are generally more restrictive than the civil divorce rules of most countries. Most [[Protestant]] churches discourage divorce except as a last resort, but do not actually prohibit it through church doctrine.

The Christian emperors [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] restricted the [[grounds for divorce]] to grave cause, but this was relaxed by [[Justinian]] in the 6th century. After the fall of the empire, familial life was regulated more by ecclesiastical authority than civil authority.

== Roman Catholic Church ==
Although marriage was not yet a declared, defined [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]], by the ninth or tenth century, the divorce rate had been greatly reduced under the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Kent's [[Commentaries on American Law]], p. 96 (14th ed. 1896))&lt;/ref&gt; which considered marriage to be instituted by [[God]] and [[Christ]] indissoluble by mere human action.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://scripturetext.com/mark/10-9.htm Mark 10:9]; [[Canon law|Canons]] of the [[Council of Trent]], Twenty-fourth Session.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage was later defined as a sacrament, beginning in 1208, when [[Pope Innocent III]] required members of another religious movement to recognize that marriage was a sacrament as a condition for being received back into the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=SystTheol&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Tp7KLNb3xcC&amp;pg=PA320 Francis Schüssler Fiorenza, John P. Galvin (editors), ''Systematic Theology''] (Fortress Press 1991 {{ISBN|978-1-45140795-2}}), vol. 2, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; In 1254, Catholics accused Waldensians of condemning the sacrament of marriage, "saying that married persons sin mortally if they come together without the hope of offspring".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LDbhV7u1_yIC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=Thomsett+%22married+persons+sin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ucgpUp2xKOyO7Qaj94C4Cw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomsett%20%22married%20persons%20sin%22&amp;f=false Michael Thomsett, ''Heresy in the Roman Catholic church: A history''], McFarland 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-78648539-0}}), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1439 the [[Council of Florence]] defined marriage as a sacrament, solidifying the development of doctrine from the previous twelve centuries and described marriage as 'indisoluble' "since it signifies the indivisible union of Christ and the church." The passage follows, "Although the separation of bed is lawful on account of fornication, it is not lawful to contract another marriage since the bond of a legitimately contracted marriage is perpetual."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/FLORENCE.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although divorce, as known today, was generally allowed in Western Europe after the 10th century, separation of husband and wife and the [[annulment]] of marriage were also well-known. What is today referred to as “[[separate maintenance]]” (or "[[legal separation]]") was termed "divorce a mensa et thoro" ("divorce from bed-and-board"). The husband and wife physically separated and were forbidden to live or [[cohabit]] together; but their marital relationship did not fully terminate.&lt;ref&gt;Kent's Commentaries on American Law, p. 125, n. 1 (14th ed. 1896).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil courts]] had no power over marriage or divorce.

The Catholic Church historically opposed the legalization of civil divorce in Catholic countries. For example, when [[Republican Spain]] legalized divorce in Spain for the first time, [[Pope Pius XI]] wrote: 'the new Spanish legislation, with the deleterious introduction of divorce, dares to profane the sanctuary of the family, thus implanting, with the attempted dissolution of domestic society, the germs of saddest ruin for civil well-being.'&lt;ref&gt; Pius XI, Dilectissima Nobis, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canon law]] makes no provision for divorce, but [[annulment|a declaration of nullity]] may be granted when proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a valid marriage were absent — ie., that the sacrament did not take place due to some impediment. The grounds for annulment are determined by Church authority and applied in [[ecclesiastical courts]]. Annulment was known as “divorce a vinculo matrimonii,” or “divorce from all the bonds of marriage,” for [[Canon law|canonical]] causes of impediment existing at the time of the marriage. “For in cases of total divorce, the marriage is declared null, as having been absolutely unlawful ''ab initio''.”&lt;ref&gt;W. Blackstone, [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]], 428 (Legal Classics Library spec. ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kent's Commentaries on American Law, p. 1225, n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.Coke, [[Institutes of the Laws of England]], 235 (Legal Classics Library spec. ed. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; The Church holds that the sacrament of marriage produces one person from two, inseparable from each other: "Holy Scripture affirms that man and woman were created for one another: 'It is not good that the man should be alone.' The woman, 'flesh of his flesh,' his equal, his nearest in all things, is given to him by God as a 'helpmate'; she thus represents God from whom comes our help. 'Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh.' The Lord himself shows that this signifies an unbreakable union of their two lives by recalling what the plan of the Creator had been 'in the beginning': 'So they are no longer two, but one flesh.'"&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 7:1606&lt;/ref&gt; Since husband and wife became one person upon marriage, that oneness can only be seen as null if the parties improperly entered into the marriage initially, in which case the marriage does not validly exist.

In 2016, Pope [[Francis (pope)|Francis]] published ''[[Amoris laetitia]]''. However, there have been no updates to Roman Catholic Canon Law as a result of this apostolic exhortation that pertain to the reception of Holy Communion by the divorced and remarried who live together "more uxorio".

== Eastern Orthodox Church==
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] does recognize that there are  occasions when it is better that couples do separate, and permits remarriage in Church,&lt;ref name="ware" /&gt; though its divorce rules are stricter than civil divorce in most countries. For the Eastern Orthodox, the marriage is "indissoluble" as in it should not be broken, the violation of such a union, perceived as holy, being an offence resulted from either adultery or the prolonged absence of one of the partners. Thus, permitting remarriage is an act of compassion of the Church towards sinful man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/athenagoras_remarriage.htm|title=Marriage, Divorce and Remarriage in the Orthodox Church: Economia and Pastoral Guidance|publisher=The Orthodox research Institute|author=Mgr. Athenagoras Peckstadt, Bishop of Sinope|date=2005-05-18|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very low rate of divorce among Orthodox Christians in Greece may suggest that the same may be said for  Orthodox Christians in the U.S. However, U.S. rates are inconclusive. The actual divorce rate is probably somewhat higher due to civil divorces obtained without an accompanying ecclesiastical divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helleniccomserve.com/divorceperspective.html|title=A Perspective on Divorce Among Greek Orthodox Couples. |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorced individuals are usually allowed to remarry though there is usually imposed on them a penance by their bishop and the services for a second marriage in this case are more penitential than joyful. The Orthodox Church traditionally states that "it blesses the first marriage, performs the second, tolerates the third, and forbids the fourth". Widowed spouses are permitted to remarry without repercussion and their second marriage is considered just as blessed as the first. One exception to this rule is the clergy and their wives. Should a married priest die, it is expected that his widow will not remarry. Widowed priests are not allowed to remarry and frequently end up in monasteries.

== Oriental Orthodox Churches ==

The Oriental Orthodox Churches are more severe than the Eastern Orthodox Church in terms of divorce and adopt an intermediate position between Rome and Constantinople, allowing it only in the case of [[adultery]]. This position is true for both Copts and Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1999/423/intrview.htm Marriage, politics and Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiwa-net.org/Karekin.html Catholicos Karekin I : Statement on Women] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20010614051035/http://www.aiwa-net.org/Karekin.html |date=June 14, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reformed Churches ==
The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ Westminster Confession of Faith]&lt;/ref&gt; (WCF), which is a secondary standard of the [[Presbyterian Church]], allows for divorce under certain circumstances. In [http://opc.org/wcf.html#Chapter_24 chapter 24, section 5], it states that the contract of marriage may be dissolved in the case of adultery or abandonment, citing [http://legacy.esvbible.org/search/Matthew+5.31-32/ Matthew 5.31] as proof.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, D., ''Christian Ideals in British Culture: Stories of Belief in the Twentieth Century'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, p. 139.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ksiWjEN1pc0C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=anglican+views+on+divorce+confession&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CNWpU97xGunE7AaV54HYCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anglican%20views%20on%20divorce%20confession&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Not affiliated with the United Methodist Church) ==
The [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22, 23). We deplore the evils of divorce and remarriage. We regard adultery as the only scripturally justifiable grounds for divorce; and the party guilty of adultery has by his or her act forfeited membership in the church. In the case of divorce for other cause, neither party shall be permitted to marry again during the lifetime of the other; and violation of this law shall be punished by expulsion from the church (Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:11, 12). In the carrying out of these principles, guilt shall be established in accordance with judicial procedures set forth in ''The Discipline''.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Baptist Churches ==
Many [[conservative]] [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Protestant]] churches, such as some [[Baptists]], strongly oppose divorce, viewing it as a sin, pointing out [[Malachi]] 2:16 – {{"'}}For I hate divorce,' says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'and him who covers his garment with violence!' says Yahweh of Armies. 'Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you don't deal treacherously{{'"}} ([[World English Bible|WEB]]). However [[interfaith marriage]]s are handled differently in [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 9–10 and [[1 Corinthians]] 7 (the [[Pauline privilege]]). Protestant scholar [[William A. Heth|Bill Heth]] states that this is the majority view.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=William|first=Heth|title=Jesus on Divorce: How My Mind Has Changed|url=http://wisereaction.org/ebooks/heth_mind_changed.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ==

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) officially discourages divorce. The LDS Church encourages its members to work around marital problems before they lead to annulment or divorce, yet allows both practices in circumstances of infidelity or other serious cases.&lt;ref name="Heaton, Tim B 1985"&gt;Heaton, Tim B. and Kristen L. Goodman “Religion and Family Formation.” Review of Religious Research, Vol 26, No. 4 (June, 1985) Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Divorce is regarded with heavy social stigma, and [[General authority|Church authorities]] maintain that “Latter-day Saints need not divorce—there are solutions to marriage problems.”&lt;ref&gt;Haight, David B. “Marriage and Divorce”. Ensign (May 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; LDS Church policy allows members to seek civil divorce independent of ecclesiastical authority, but cancellation of a temple sealing may only be performed with special permission from the [[First Presidency]] of the Church.  

The LDS Church discourages divorce largely on account of its theology of the family. Early church leaders taught that God himself lives in a family and with a wife.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Arland, "Religion and Fertility: The Case of Mormonism" Journal of Marriage and Family, Vol. 41, No. 1  (Feb., 1979), pp. 131-142&lt;/ref&gt; Tim B. Heaton, a [[sociologist]] from [[Brigham Young University]], explains, “The key tenet in the Mormon Theology of the family is that, given the proper circumstances, family relationships will be perpetuated in heaven.”&lt;ref name="Heaton, Tim B 1985"/&gt;

[[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint culture]] places an extreme emphasis on success in family life, leading to high expectations for marital success. [[David O. McKay]], former [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]], stated that “no other success can compensate for failure in the home.”&lt;ref&gt;(Quoted from J. E. McCullough, Home: The Savior of Civilization [1924], 42; Conference Report, Apr. 1935, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Church publications often publish articles instructing members on means to improve married life,&lt;ref name="Heaton, Tim B 1985"/&gt; and, on rare occasions, will become involved politically when it feels the institution of marriage is threatened by proposed public policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/280669/3/ "LDS Donate Millions to Fight Gay Marriage"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918205109/http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/280669/3/ |date=September 18, 2008 }}  Retrieved 2011-11-28&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Authorities|General Authority]] of the Church have repeatedly warned against an impermanent view of marriage. "[The view of marriage] as a mere contract that may be entered into at pleasure … and severed at the first difficulty … is an evil meriting severe condemnation, especially where children are made to suffer."&lt;ref&gt;David O. McKay, in Conference Report, Apr. 1969, 8–9; or “Structure of the Home Threatened by Irresponsibility and Divorce,” Improvement Era, June 1969, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Dallin H. Oaks]], a senior member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], and a former judge on the [[Utah Supreme Court]], has counseled church members that "the weakening of the concept that marriages are permanent and precious has far-reaching consequences."&lt;ref name="Oaks May 2007"&gt;{{citation |first= Dallin H. |last= Oaks |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2007/05/divorce?lang=eng |title= Divorce |journal= Ensign |date=May 2007 |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Latter-day Saint couples (both with and without [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealings]]) are found to have slightly lower rates of divorce when compared with Protestants and Catholics, and significantly lower rates when compared with those who state no religious preference.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Kristen L. “Divorce” [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]. Ed. Daniel H. Ludlow. New York: Macmillan, 1992 391-93. Print&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a chart showing the rate of divorce among various religions with data copied from the study “Religion and Family Formation,” conducted by Tim B. Heaton and Kristen L. Goodman.&lt;ref name="Heaton, Tim B 1985"/&gt;

A lower divorce rate among Latter-day Saints may be due to a strong family culture, the difficulty of securing a cancellation of sealing, and other religious influences.&lt;ref name="Heaton, Tim B 1985"/&gt; Al Thornton, from the University of Michigan, comments that, "With its unique theology and heritage concerning marriage, family, and children, it should not be surprising to find that Mormon behavior differs from that of the larger society."&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Arland, "Religion and Fertility: The Case of Mormonism" Journal of Marriage and Family, Vol. 41, No. 1  (Feb., 1979), pp. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Certain doctrines which are unique to Latter-Day Saint theology may help account for the lower divorce rate among active members. These doctrines include the literal parenthood of God the Father, the eternal nature of families, and the requirement of a successful temple marriage in order to gain salvation.&lt;ref name="Kunz, Phillip R 1964 pp. 211"&gt;Kunz, Phillip R.

Various factors have been shown to lower incidence of divorce among church members, including church activity. Heaton says that, “Overall, church attendance is associated with lower rates of nonmarriage and divorce, [and] higher probabilities of remarriage after divorce.”&lt;ref name="Heaton, Tim B 1985"/&gt;  Studies suggest that the most important statistical variable affecting marital dissolution rates of Latter-day Saints is marriage in the temple, with some studies finding that non-temple marriages entered into by Latter-day Saints are almost five times more likely to result in divorce than are temple marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Duke, James  T. “Latter-Day Saint Social Life: Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members." Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, C. 1998 pp. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] states that “[t]he Church distinguishes between (1) civil marriages, which are valid for "time" (until divorce or the death of one spouse), and (2) temple marriages, or sealings, solemnized by proper ecclesiastical authority, which are binding for "time and all eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Kristen L. “Divorce” Encyclopedia of Mormonism. Ed. Daniel H. Ludlow. New York: Macmillan, 1992 391-93. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a marriage to be considered eternally binding, it must be performed in a Latter-Day Saint temple by properly authorized temple workers.&lt;ref name="Kunz, Phillip R 1964 pp. 211"/&gt; Marriage in the temple is strongly encouraged by church leaders, as Latter-day Saint marriages performed in the temple have less than a 7% chance of dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, T.

London. “Pre-Marital Sex and the Risk of Divorce.” Journal of Marriage and Family 53.4 (1991) Web, Retrieved 9/29/2011&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic also fails to take into account couples who enter into a temple marriage and subsequently obtain a civil divorce, yet fail to apply for a cancellation of temple sealings. Nevertheless, numerous studies show a strong link in the Latter-day Saint culture between marriage in the temple and a lower divorce rate, and that among members "the temple marriage [is] the most resistant to divorce."&lt;ref&gt;Kunz, Phillip R. "Mormon and non-Mormon Divorce Patterns," Journal of Marriage and the Family, Vol 26, No. 2 (May, 1964) pp. 212&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to obtain a cancellation of temple sealings, permission from the [[First Presidency]] is required. Applicants for divorce are required to submit a request for a cancellation of sealings through their local ecclesiastical authorities, including information about the couple, and a personal appeal. The resulting cultural impact of a divorce upon an LDS couple is significant. Church leaders have stated that “every divorce is the result of selfishness on the part of one or both,”&lt;ref name="Oaks May 2007" /&gt; and that selfishness is a leading cause of marital stress and divorce.  Divorced Latter-day Saints may report feelings of alienation from fellow church-members  and some Latter-day Saints may see divorce as “a sign of failure”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Hoopes |first= Margaret H. |date=November 1972 |title= Alone through Divorce |journal= Ensign |publisher= LDS Church |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1972/11/alone-through-divorce?lang=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Devasthanam''' means Abode of [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]. Devas are generally Hindu deities. Thus a Devasthanam can be commonly termed as a [[Hindu temple]], which is the place dedicated to the worship of Hindu deities. In these places of worship offerings are made to the worshiping idol, rituals are performed and there will be a priest who maintains and operates the smooth functioning of the temple. The underlying spiritual principles in Hindu temples are taken from old Sanskrit Vedas, [[Upanishads]] and the structural principles are taken from Sanskrit literature like Brihat Samhitha, Vasthu Sasthras etc.  In Indian context a Devasthanam is referred to as the place in which Hindu Gods and Goddesses resides. Devasthanams were built in India as a dedication to the Gods who once lived there. Devasthanams welcome devotees and aids them obtaining a hopeful and successful life.

The famous Devasthanams in India are located to the southern part of the country and are situated in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamilnadu and Kerala. The renowned Devasthanam in India is Thirumala Thirupati Devasthanam which is dedicated to [[Lord Vishnu]] who lived there as [[Lord Srinivasa]] and later married Lady Padmavati. Another popular Devasthanam located in the state of Tamilnadu is the Palani Dandayudhapani Swamy Devasthanam. It is one of the richest temples in India. This Devasthanam is considered to be one of the Abodes of [[Lord Muruga]]. Kerala, God’s own country is famous for upholding religious and cultural values. There are lots of Devasthanams in Kerala. Peringottukara Devasthanam is the most famous Devasthanams among the many Abode of Devas in Kerala,Peringottukara Devasthanam is the oldest Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan Devasthanam in India. 


==Thirumala Thirupati Devasthanam==
The Vaishnava temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The Devasthanam lies in the Thirumala hills of Andhra Pradesh.  The legend says, once Sage Brighu wanted to find out who is the Supreme one among the Trimurtis (Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Siva). The Sage was not satisfied with the hospitality given by Lord Brahma and Lord Siva; the sage went to Vaikunta (residing place of Lord Vishnu) and kicked Lord Vishnu on the chest to grab his attention. It is believed that Lady Lakshmi was residing in the chest of the Lord Vishnu. The act of Sage Bhrigu insulted Lady Lakshmi and she left Vaikunta to the earth. Lord Vishnu came to the earth in search of her who had taken birth in the family of a king in the name Padmavati and married her on the Tirupati hills and got enshrined there forever to save the people.

From history it is evident that the construction of [[Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala|Tirupati temple]] began in AD 300. The golden period of the temple was the reigning period of Vijayanagara rules that filled the treasury of the temple with gold and diamonds. The Tirupati temple operations are now managed now by a trust called Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. The temple is the richest temple in India and each day thousands of devotees seek blessings from lord Venkateshwara.  
[[File:Palani temple (3).jpg|thumb|Palani Devasthanam]]

==Palani Dandayudhapani Swamy Devasthanam==
The idol worshiped in the [[Palani Murugan temple|Palani temple]] is Lord Muruga, son of Lord Siva and Lady Parvathy. The Devasthanam is located in the town of Palani in Dindigul District in the state of Tamilnadu.  The temple legend says, Lord Muruga was defeated by his brother Lord Ganesha in contest given by their father Lord Siva. Feeling irritated Lord Muruga left his parents and came to Tiru Avinankudi which means the foot of the Sivagiri. Siva appeased the situation by telling Lord Muruga that he (Lord Muruga) himself was the fruit (Pazham). Hence the place was called Pazham-nee (You are the fruit) or Palani. Lord Muruga later settled in Palani as a hermit in peace and solitude. Lord Muruga, thus became Lord Dandayudhapani, who stands for repudiation by ditching all worldly possessions in order to save his subjects.

The temple was believed to be constructed by a Chera King called Cheraman Perumal. Later on Kings from different dynasties contributed to the growth of the temple of Lord Dandayudhapani. The edicts on the walls of the Palani temple stand as proof of the gifts for conducting poojas and constructions made by several Kings. The temple now stands as a proud example of the cultural and religious beauty of India. Tonsuring of devotees is a famous tradition.

==Peringottukara Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan Devasthanam==
[[File:Perigottukara Devasthanam Outside View.jpg|thumb|Perigottukara Devasthanam]]
The Peringottukara Devasthanam is known for its deity Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan.&lt;ref name="devasthanam"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://devasthanam.com/|title=devasthanam|website=devasthanam.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated in the state of Kerala in a place called Peringottukara, Thrissur. Peringottukara village is blessed by the divine presence of famous social reformer and preacher of spiritual freedom and social equality Sree Narayana Guru. Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan is the son of Lord Siva and Lady Parvathy who disguised herself as a tribal woman Koolivaka. The Lord [[Vishnumaya]] Kuttichathan shunned all her heavenly possessions and lived with the common folks. Legends say, Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan had killed demons like Bhringa and Jalandhara.&lt;ref name="devasthanam"/&gt; Peringottukara Devasthanam has a tradition of 5 centuries in Kuttichathan Seva.&lt;ref name="devasthanam"/&gt;

Later the founder priest of the Devasthanam Sree Velumuthappan Swamy to pacify the land prayed to the Goddess of the entire world, Lady Bhuvaneshwary who in turn asked the founder priest to build a temple for Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan. The shrine built by Sree Velumuthappan Swamy is now worshipped by thousands as Peringottukara Devasthanam. The Devasthanam is famous for its 51 feet height terracotta Stupa of Lord Vishnumaya Kuttichathan. Maharoopakalam is the famous festival in Perigottukara Devasthanam.

{{Ecclesiastical polity}}
[[File:Mitre evolution.gif|thumb|right|Church authority in ceremonies is often represented by a [[mitre]] as headdress.]]
[[File:Roma-san giovanni03.jpg|thumb|The chair ([[cathedra]]) of the [[Supreme Pontiff]] (Pope) of the [[Catholic Church]] in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran|Archbasilica of St. John in Lateran]] in [[Rome]], Italy represents his episcopal authority.]]

An '''episcopal polity''' is a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] form of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church governance ("ecclesiastical polity")]] in which the chief local authorities are called [[bishop]]s. (The word "bishop" derives, via the [[British Latin]] and [[Vulgar Latin]] term ''*ebiscopus''/''*biscopus'', from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|επίσκοπος}} ''epískopos'' meaning "overseer".) It is the structure used by many of the major [[Christian Church]]es and [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, such as the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches or denominations, and other churches founded independently from these lineages.

Churches with an episcopal [[polity]] are governed by bishops, practicing their authorities in the [[diocese]]s and [[Episcopal Conference|conference]]s or [[synod]]s. Their leadership is both [[sacrament]]al and constitutional; as well as performing [[ordination]]s, [[confirmation]]s, and [[consecration]]s, the bishop supervises the [[clergy]] within a local jurisdiction and is the representative both to secular structures and within the hierarchy of the church. Bishops are considered to derive their authority from an unbroken, personal [[apostolic succession]] from the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]]. Bishops with such authority are said to represent the [[historical episcopate]] or historic episcopate. Churches with this type of government usually believe that the Church requires episcopal government as described in the New Testament (see  [http://www.usccb.org/bible/1timothy/3 1 Timothy 3] and [http://www.usccb.org/bible/2timothy/1 2 Timothy 1]). In some systems, bishops may be subject to bishops holding a higher office (variously called [[archbishop]]s, [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s, or [[patriarch]]s, depending upon the tradition).  They also meet in councils or [[synods]]. These gatherings, subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops, usually make important decisions, though the [[synod]] or council may also be purely advisory.

For much of the [[recorded history|written history]] of institutional Christianity, episcopal government was the only known form of church organization. This changed at the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches are now organized by either [[Congregationalist polity|congregational]] or [[Presbyterian polity|presbyterian]] church polities, both descended from the writings of [[John Calvin]], a Protestant reformer working and writing independently following the break with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] precipitated by [[The Ninety-Five Theses]] of [[Martin Luther]].

==Overview of episcopal churches==
[[File:Chartres 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The government of a bishop is typically symbolized by a cathedral church, such as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chartres|bishops]]'s [[episcopal see|see]] at [[Chartres Cathedral]].]]
The definition of the word ''episcopal'' has variation among Christian traditions. There are subtle differences in governmental principles among episcopal churches at the present time. To some extent the separation of episcopal churches can be traced to these differences in [[ecclesiology]], that is, their theological understanding of church and church governance. For some, "episcopal churches" are churches that use a hierarchy of bishops that regard themselves as being in an unbroken, personal [[apostolic succession]].

"Episcopal" is also commonly used to distinguish between the various organizational structures of [[Christian denomination|denominations]].  For instance, "Presbyterian" ({{lang-el|'πρεσβύτης}}, presbítes) is used to describe a church governed by a hierarchy of assemblies of elected [[Elder (religious)|elders]], referred to as [[Presbyterian polity]]. Similarly, "episcopal" is used to describe a church governed by bishops. Self-governed local congregations, governed neither by elders nor bishops, are usually described as "[[Congregational polity|congregational]]".

More specifically, the capitalized appellation "Episcopal" is applied to several churches historically based within [[Anglicanism]] ("Episcopalianism"), including those still in communion with the [[Church of England]].

Using these definitions, examples of specific episcopal churches include:
* The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]
* The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]
* The [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches
* The [[Assyrian Church of the East]]
* The Churches of the [[Anglican Communion]]
* The [[Old Catholic]] churches
* Numerous smaller [[Catholic Church (disambiguation)|"catholic" churches]]
* Certain national churches of the [[Lutheran]] confession
* The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]
* The [[United Methodist Church]]

Some [[Lutheran]] churches practice congregational polity or a form of presbyterian polity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Religion and Society, William H. Swatos, Jr. Editor [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Lutharanism.htm Lutheranism] Hartford Institute for Religion Research, Hartford Seminary.  Retrieved on September 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including the [[Church of Sweden]], practice episcopal polity; the Church of Sweden also counts its bishops among the [[historical episcopate|historic episcopate]] as do some American Lutheran churches like the [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church]], [[Lutheran Orthodox Church]], [[Lutheran Church - International]], and the [[Lutheran Episcopal Communion]].

Many [[Methodist]] churches (see The [[United Methodist Church]], among others) retain the form and function of episcopal polity, although in a modified form, called [[connexionalism]]. Since all trace their ordinations to an Anglican priest, [[John Wesley]], it is generally considered that their bishops do not share in apostolic succession, though United Methodists still affirm that their bishops share in the historic episcopate.

==Before the Great Schism==
{{Roman Catholicism}}
{{main|Bishop#History}}
All orthodox Christians were in churches with an episcopal government, that is, one Church under local bishops and regional [[Patriarch]]s. Writing between ca. 85 and 110, St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]], Patriarch of Antioch, was the earliest of the Church fathers to define the importance of episcopal government. Assuming Ignatius' view was the Apostolic teaching and practice, the line of succession was unbroken and passed through the four ancient Patriarchal sees (those local churches known to be founded by apostles), Rome, Jerusalem, Antioch and Alexandria. Rome was the leading Patriarchate of the ancient four by virtue of its founding by Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and their martyrdom there, not to mention being the political center of the Roman empire at the time. Some organizations (e.g. the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]), though aloof from the political wranglings of imperial Christianity, nevertheless also practiced episcopal polity.

Shortly after the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]] legalized Christianity in 321, he also constructed an elaborate second capital of the Roman Empire located at [[Byzantium]] and renamed it [[Constantinople]], in 324. The single Roman Empire was divided between these two autonomous administrative centers, Roman and Constantinopolitan, West and East, Latin speaking and Greek speaking. This remained the status quo through the fourth century.  A deep chasm developed between the East and West, becoming critical around 350, known as the Arian, or Nicene controversy.  The Eastern Christian Churches were thought by Constantine to believe against the Trinity; that Christ was lesser than God.  Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers, France, believed that the Eastern Church should be given the opportunity to, at least, be educated on the subject. Constantine, in his wisdom, and upset by disagreement, banished Hilary to the East.  Hilary perfected his Greek language skills while in exile, and determined the great divide between Rome and the East was actually not a disagreement at all, and was merely a linguistic ignorance on the part of his Latin speaking contemporaries.  This truth became known in the West, though some differences lingered. [[Hilary of Poitiers]] later became St. Hilary, Doctor of the Church, for exposing the true Christian beliefs of the Eastern Church.  Many of Hilary's writings were lost to time.

In the fifth century, Pope Dioscorus, the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], rejected certain Christological dogmas promulgated by the [[Council of Chalcedon]], and as a result, the Oriental Orthodox churches split from the rest; however they continued the episcopal tradition, and today in fact there is dialog between the various orthodox churches over whether the schism was due to real differences or simply translation failures. 

Also during the fifth century, the Western Roman Empire declined and was overrun by German and Frankish peoples.  Although the city of Rome was in ruins, distant from the seat of secular power, and constantly harassed by invaders, the Roman Patriarchate remained the center of the Western or Latin Church. Claiming the ancient [[primacy of Peter]] and the title of "[[Apostolic See]]", it remained the last [[ecclesiastical court|court of episcopal appeal]] in serious matters for the whole Church, East and West. However, the center of the civilized Roman world had shifted definitively to Constantinople, or [[New Rome]], the capital of the Greek speaking Empire.  Along with this shift, the effective administration of the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire also shifted. This practical eminence of Constantinople in the East is evident, first at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] 381, and then ecumenically at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451.

Beginning with [[John the Faster]] (John IV, 582-595), the Bishop of Constantinople  adopted as a formal title for himself the by then customary honorific [[Ecumenical patriarch|Ecumenical Patriarch]] ("pre-eminent father for the civilized world") over the strong objections of Rome, a title based on the political prestige of Constantinople and its economic and cultural centrality in the Empire.  In the following years, Rome's appeals to the East were based on the unique authority of the [[Apostolic See]] and the [[primacy of Peter]], over the powers of councils as defended by the East (councils, for example, had endorsed that lofty title which Rome contested).

The sometimes subtle differences between Eastern and Western conceptions of authority and its exercise produced a gradually widening rift between the Churches which continued with some occasional relief throughout the following centuries until the final rupture of the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] (marked by two dates: 16 July 1054 and the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439).

==Catholic Church==
{{Main|Bishop (Roman Catholic Church)}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] has an episcopate, with the [[Pope]], who is the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], at the top. The Catholic Church considers that juridical oversight over the Church is not a power that derives from human beings, but strictly from the authority of Christ, which was given to his twelve [[apostle]]s.  The [[See of Rome]], as the unbroken line of apostolic authority descending from St. Peter (the "prince and head of the apostles"), is a visible sign and instrument of communion among the college of bishops and therefore also of the local churches around the world. In communion with the worldwide [[college of bishops]], the Pope has all legitimate juridical and teaching authority over the whole Church.  This authority given by Christ to St. Peter and the apostles is transmitted from one generation to the next by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], through the [[laying on of hands]] from the Apostles to the bishops, in unbroken succession.

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
The conciliar idea of episcopal government continues in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In Eastern Orthodoxy, all [[autocephaly|autocephalous]] [[primate (bishop)|primates]] are seen as collectively gathering around Christ, with other archbishops and bishops gathering around them, and so forth, in a model called "conciliar hierarchy". This is based in part on the vision in the [[book of Revelation]] of the 24 elders gathered around the throne of Christ, who are believed to represent the 12 patriarchs of Israel and the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ. There is no single Patriarch with exclusive authority comparable to the Pope in Rome. However, the Patriarch of Constantinople (now Istanbul) is seen as the ''[[primus inter pares]]'', the "first among equals" of the autocephalous churches of Eastern Orthodoxy.

==Oriental Orthodox churches==
The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]] affirm the ideas of apostolic succession and episcopal government. Within each national Church, the bishops form a holy [[synod]] to which even the Patriarch is subject. The [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] traces its [[apostolic succession]] to St. Peter and recognises Antioch as the original [[See of St. Peter]]. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] traces its lineage to the Apostle Bartholomew. The [[Indian Orthodox Church]] traces its lineage to the Apostle Thomas. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] received its lines of succession through the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] in the fifth century.

Both the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Greek]] and Coptic Orthodox Churches each recognise their own Pope of Alexandria ([[Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa]], and [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] respectively), both of whom trace their apostolic succession back to the [[Mark the Evangelist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of an ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that St. Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 AD. "Two Thousand Years of Coptic Christianity", Otto F.A. Meinardus, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; There are official ongoing efforts in recent times to heal this ancient breach. Already, the two recognize each other's [[baptism]]s, [[chrismation]]s, and [[marriage]]s, making intermarriage much easier.

==Church of the East==
Historically, the [[Church of the East]] has traced its episcopal succession to St. Thomas the Apostle. Currently the bishops of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] continue to maintain its apostolic succession.

==Anglican Communion==
{{Anglicanism}}
[[Anglicanism]] is the most prominent of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] traditions to lay claim to the historic episcopate through [[apostolic succession]] in terms comparable to the various Roman Catholic and Orthodox Communions. Anglicans assert unbroken episcopal succession in and through the [[Church of England]] back to [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine of Canterbury]] and to the first century [[Roman province]] of [[Roman province of Britannia|Britannia]]. While some Celtic Christian practices were changed at the [[Synod of Whitby]], the church in the British Isles was under papal authority from earliest times.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Holden and Andrew Pinsent, The Catholic Gift to Civilisation (London: CTS), p.13ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] effectively establishing the independence from Rome of the Church of England, did not alter its constitutional or pastoral structures. [[Royal supremacy]] was exercised through the extant legal structures of the church, whose leaders were bishops. Episcopacy was thus seen as a given of the Reformed ''Ecclesia Anglicana'', and a foundation in the institution's appeal to ancient and apostolic legitimacy. What did change was that bishops were now seen to be ministers of the Crown for the spiritual government of its subjects. The influence of [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] was crucial to an evolution in this understanding in which bishops came to be seen in their more traditional role as ones who delegate to the [[presbyterate]] inherited powers, act as pastors to presbyters, and holding a particular teaching office with respect to the wider church.

Anglican opinion has differed as to the way in which episcopal government is ''de jure divino'' (by the [[Divine Right of Kings]]).  On the one hand, the seventeenth century divine, [[John Cosin]], held that episcopal authority is ''jure divino'', but that it stemmed from "apostolic practice and the customs of the Church...[not] absolute precept that either Christ or His Apostles gave about it" (a view maintained also by Hooker).&lt;ref&gt;Cosin, ''Works'', Vol. IV (Oxford, 1855), p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Lancelot Andrewes]] and others held that episcopal government is derived from Christ via the apostles.  Regardless, both parties viewed the episcopacy as bearing the apostolic function of oversight, which both includes, and derives from the power of ordination, and is normative for the governance of the church.  The practice of apostolic succession both ensures the legitimacy of the church's mission and establishes the unity, communion, and continuity of the local church with the universal church.  This formulation, in turn, laid the groundwork for an independent view of the church as a "sacred society" distinct from civil society, which was so crucial for the development of local churches as non-established entities outside England, and gave direct rise to the [[Catholic Revival]] and [[disestablishmentarianism]] within England.

Functionally, Anglican episcopal authority is expressed [[synod]]ically, although individual provinces may accord their [[primate (bishop)|primate]] with more or less authority to act independently.  Called variously "synods," "councils," or "conventions," they meet under episcopal chairmanship.  In many jurisdictions, conciliar resolutions that have been passed require episcopal assent or consent to take force.  Seen in this way, Anglicans often speak of "the bishop-in-synod" as the force and authority of episcopal governance.  Such conciliar authority extends to the standard areas of doctrine, [[church discipline|discipline]], and worship, but in these regards is limited by Anglicanism's tradition of the limits of authority.  Those limits are expressed in Article XXI of the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of Religion, ratified in 1571 (significantly, just as the [[Council of Trent]] was drawing to a close), which held that "General Councils...may err, and sometimes have erred...wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture."  Hence, Anglican jurisdictions have traditionally been conservative in their approach to either innovative doctrinal development or in encompassing actions of the church as doctrinal (see [[lex orandi, lex credendi]]).

Anglican synodical government, though varied in expression, is characteristically representative. Provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]], their [[ecclesiastical province]]s and [[diocese]]s are governed by councils consisting not only of bishops, but also representatives of the [[presbyterate]] and [[laity]]. The spread of increasingly [[democracy|democratic]] forms of representative governance has its origin in the formation of the first General Conventions of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|American Episcopal Church]] in the 1780s, which established a "House of Bishops" and a "House of Deputies". In many jurisdictions, there is also a third, clerical House. Resolutions may be voted on jointly or by each House, in the latter case requiring passage in all Houses to be adopted by the particular council.

There is no international juridical authority in Anglicanism, although the tradition's common experience of episcopacy, symbolised by the historical link with the [[episcopal see|See]] of [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]], along with a common and complex liturgical tradition, has provided a measure of unity. This has been reinforced by the [[Lambeth Conference]]s of Anglican Communion bishops, which first met in 1867. These conferences, though they propose and pass resolutions, are strictly consultative, and the intent of the resolutions are to provide guideposts for Anglican jurisdictions—not direction. The Conferences also express the function of the episcopate to demonstrate the ecumenical and Catholic nature of the church.

The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] traces [[History of the Scottish Episcopal Church|its history]] back to the origins of Christianity in Scotland, and during the 16th century [[Scottish Reformation]] became a distinct church from the presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]] which rejected episcopal government. The Scottish Episcopal Church was formally incorporated in 1712, and it more recently became part of the [[Anglican Communion]].

Churches that are members of the Anglican Communion are episcopal churches in polity, and some are named "Episcopal". However, some churches that self-identify as Anglican do not belong to the Anglican Communion, and not all episcopally-governed churches are Anglican.  The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Old Catholic Church]]es (in full communion with, but not members of, the Anglican Communion), and the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox churches]] are recognized, and also their bishops, by [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].

==American Methodist churches==
{{further|Connexionalism}}
As an offshoot of [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism|Methodist churches]] often use episcopal polity for historical as well as practical reasons, albeit to limited use. Methodists often use the term ''[[connexionalism]]'' or ''connexional polity'' in addition to "episcopal". Nevertheless, the powers of the Methodist episcopacy can be relatively strong and wide-reaching compared to traditional conceptions of episcopal polity.  For example, in the [[United Methodist Church]], bishops are elected for life, can serve up to two terms in a specific conference (three if special permission is given), are responsible for ordaining and appointing clergy to pastor churches, perform many administrative duties, preside at the annual sessions of the regional Conferences and at the quadrennial meeting of the worldwide General Conference, have authority for teaching and leading the church on matters of social and doctrinal import, and serve to represent the denomination in ecumenical gatherings. United Methodist bishops in the United States serve in their appointed conferences, being moved to a new "Episcopal Area" after 8 (or 12) years, until their mandated retirement at the end of the quadrenium following their sixty-sixth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/interior.asp?ptid=21&amp;mid=5860 Still in Production]. UMC.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
British Methodism holds that all ordained ministers are equal in terms of spirituality. However, for practical management lines are drawn into President of Conference, Chair of District, Superintendent Minister, Minister. However, all are ministers.

==Episcopal government in other denominations==

The [[Reformed Church of Hungary]], and the [[Lutheran church]]es in [[continental Europe]] may sometimes be called "episcopal".  In these latter cases, the form of government is not radically different from the [[presbyterian]] form, except that their councils of bishops have hierarchical [[jurisdiction]] over the local ruling bodies to a greater extent than in most [[Presbyterian]] and other [[Reformed churches]]. As mentioned, the Lutheran Church in Sweden and Finland are exceptions, claiming apostolic succession in a pattern somewhat like the Anglican churches.  Otherwise, forms of polity are not mandated in the Lutheran churches, as it is not regarded as having doctrinal significance. [[Old World]] Lutheranism, for historical reasons, has tended to adopt [[Erastian]] theories of episcopal authority (by which church authority is to a limited extent sanctioned by secular government).  In the United States, the Lutheran churches tend to adopt a form of government more comparable to [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalism]]. A small minority of [[Episcopal Baptists]] exists. 

Most [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] churches of the [[plain dress]] tradition follow an episcopal system, at least in name. Congregational governance is strongly emphasized, and each congregation elects its pastor. Bishops enforce inter-congregational unity and may discipline pastors for breaking from traditional norms.

Although it never uses the term, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is episcopal, rather than presbyterian or congregational, in the sense that it has a strict hierarchy of leadership from the local bishop/branch president up to a single prophet/president, believed to be personally authorized and guided by Jesus Christ.  Local congregations (branches, wards, and stakes) have ''de jure'' boundaries by which members are allocated, and membership records are centralized.  This system developed gradually from a more presbyterian polity ([[Joseph Smith]]'s original title in 1830 was "First Elder") for pragmatic and doctrinal reasons, reaching a full episcopacy during the [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] period (1839–1846).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5575">'''Ahmadiyya Community''' is a sect of [[Islam]] which originated from India and spread all across the world. It was founded by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] in 1889. The total population of the community is estimated to be between 10–15 million, with main concentrations in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3098725.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Islamic sect gathers in Surrey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/introduction/index.html Ahmadiyya  Community – An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadcasts on Centenary Khilafat Celebrations on MTA international on May 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For a history timeline see [[Timeline of Ahmadiyya history]].

==Founding of Community in 1889==

{{See also|Bay'ah (Ahmadiyya)|Ten Conditions of Bai'at}}
After he rose to fame by debating with [[Hindu]] and Christian priesthood. He was revealed{{clarify|date=December 2011}} to take the covenant. The first one was [[Hakeem Noor-ud-Din]] who became the first [[Caliph]] of the community. On this day, 40 followers had taken the covenant.

==First Meal and Prayer==

After the taking of covenant, a meal was eaten and a prayer was held by all of the companions of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. It was the first gathering of the community.

==Increasing of Ahmadis==

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad had travelled in India and the number of [[Ahmadis]] increased.

==Claim and Rejection==

{{main|Persecution of Ahmadis}}
When Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to be the Promised [[Messiah]] for whom the [[Muslims]] were waiting, Maulvi Muhammad Hussein of [[Batala]], who was his colleague was the first one to reject him. After his claim, he and his followers were the subject of the [[Muslim]] majority in [[India]]. The persecution of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community started from that day.

==Fatwa by Muslim Opponents==

Hussein indulged other [[clerics]] to prepare a fatwa against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and his followers. A [[Fatwa]] of 150 or 250 pages were prepared by him which contained fatwas from all of the [[Islamic]] clerics from all of India.

==The split of in 1914==


The split in 1914 resulted in the formation of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and the [[Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement]], also known as Anjuman Isha`at-e-Islam. The primary reason for the split was differences over the suitability of the elected Khalifa (2nd successor) [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad]] (the son of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad) and also ideological differences on key theological issues.

The key ideological differences leading to the split pertained to the status of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad being a prophet or simply a mujadid, and the status of Muslims not accepting Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's claims.

The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement believes Muhammad to be the last of the prophets, and that after him no prophet can appear—neither a past one like Jesus, nor a new one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20041121144454/http://aaiil.info/misconceptions/khatam/khatam.htm “The Issue of Khatam-un-Nabiyyin”], The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is referred to as a Prophet in the metaphorical sense only (as other saints have been referred to as well), and not in the real and technical meaning of the word as used in Islamic terminology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050128093855/http://aaiil.info/misconceptions/nabirasul/nabirasul.htm “The Use of the Terms Nabi &amp; Rasul For Non-prophets”], The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community hold that Muhammad was the last law-bearing prophet and new non-law bearing prophets can come after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/promisedmessiah/index.htm?page=37 |title=The Question of Finality of Prophethood {{pipe}} The Promised Messiah and Mahdi by Dr. Aziz Ahmad Chaudhry, Islam International Publications Limited |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hold Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be a Prophet (with all the qualities of a prophet like Jesus) but subordinate and deputy to Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A World Reformer {{pipe}} The Promised Mehdi and Messiha, by Dr. Aziz Ahmad Chaudhry, Islam International Publications Limited |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/promisedmessiah/index.htm?page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has established centres in 200 countries and states that its membership is in the tens of millions,&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4009445.ece | title=The Ahmadi Muslim Community, Who are they? | date=27 May 2008 |work=The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;  while the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement states it is established in 17 countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aaiil.org/text/cntct/contact.shtml | title=World Wide Branches of AAIIL | publisher=Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger body of Ahmadi Muslims belonging in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community however contend that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad himself received a revelation by God concerning a future split in his Community and that it would be concerning his Promised Son:

{{Quotation|God has conveyed to me that there would be a great split in my Movement as well, and mischief makers and those who are the slaves of their own desires will depart... It will be the time of my Promised Son ([[Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad]]). God has decreed these events in connection with him... Be sure to recognize the Promised Son.|[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Tadhkirah.pdf Tadhkirah] pg. 1066–1067}}

'''The House of David''' (formally '''The Israelite House of David''') is a religious society co-founded by Benjamin and Mary Purnell in [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]], in March 1903.&lt;ref name=SBtribeFactFiction&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mumford|first1=Lou|title=House of David tales more fiction than fact|url=http://articles.southbendtribune.com/2011-07-14/news/29776112_1_sect-members-benton-harbor-myths|accessdate=4 June 2015|publisher=The South Bend Tribune|date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1888 the Purnells discovered a group of preachers extolling a man named [[James Jershom Jezreel]] as the Sixth Messenger. Jezrel had published three books known as ''[[Extracts from the Flying Roll]]''. While the preachers were in Richmond, Benjamin and Mary joined their group, known as "the Visitation Movement", which was started by a woman named [[Joanna Southcott]], the First Messenger (Angel), in 1792.  While studying the writings of Jezreel they noticed that the Seventh and last Messenger was soon to be on the scene, which is mentioned in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 10:7. On March 12, 1895, the Purnells announced that the spirit of [[Shiloh (biblical figure)|Shiloh]] had bonded with them to become the seventh and last messenger.

The House of David was formed by Benjamin and Mary Purnell in 1903 after settling in Benton Harbor, Michigan.&lt;ref name=SBtribeFactFiction/&gt; Prior to that, the Purnells lived in [[Fostoria, Ohio]] and had two children, one of whom died in a firework factory explosion at the age of 17. The Purnells were looked down upon by residents of the city when they decided to forego the funeral due to their beliefs of not having anything to do with the dead.&lt;ref name=SBtribeFactFiction/&gt;  

The House of David colony soon had several hundred members. In 1907, the House owned about 1,000 acres, on which the colony harvested fruit from a dozen orchards and cultivated grain. The commune had its own [[cannery]], carpenter shop, coach factory, tailor shop, and steam laundry. They also owned and operated their own electricity plant, providing lighting to the community. It had three brass bands and two orchestras, and a [[zoological garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Coolidge, Orville W. (1906).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=3G0Qo9lf4nsC&amp;PA=241 ''A Twentieth Century History of Berrien County Michigan''], p. 241.  The Lewis Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations arose in the 1920s towards Benjamin F. Purnell by 13 young women confessing, under oath to the courts, that they had sexual relations with the patriarch while still minors.  As soon as this became public knowledge, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' and other newspapers ran critical articles about Purnell. He died in 1927.

One group, headed by Mary Purnell, remained together and in 1930 purchased a small plot of land. There they rebuilt and reorganized the New Israelite House of David, better known as Mary's City of David; it remained in existence until her death at the age of 90.

A second faction, the Old House of David led by Judge T. H. Dewhirst, had 350 members in 1935, 24 of whom were clergy, and in 1955 had 150 members with 10 clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1106.asp|title=House of David- Religious Groups - The Association of Religion Data Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (As of 2010, the group was reported to have three surviving members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Denise |last=Perry Donavin |format= |coauthors= |title=House of David film to premiere
 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/southbendtribune/access/2125810121.html?FMT=ABS |work=[[South Bend Tribune]] |publisher= |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2011-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Dewhirst's faction believed that Mary Purnell had no right to usurp authority over the community, as it was led by his own self-appointed council of elders.

==Baseball teams==

Purnell was a sports enthusiast and encouraged the members of the Israelite Community to play sports, especially [[baseball]], to build physical and spiritual discipline.

In 1913, the Israelite House of David began to play competitive baseball and by 1915, they were following a grueling schedule. The House of David became famous as a [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] baseball team which toured rural America from the 1920s through the 1950s, playing amateur and [[Semi-professional|semi-pro]] teams in [[exhibition game]]s.  They were motivated by the need to make money for their families and colony back home and by the opportunity to share their beliefs. The team members wore long hair and beards as they played.

By the late 1920s, needing more skilled players, the House began hiring professionals, the most notable being [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]], [[Satchel Paige]], and [[Mordecai Brown]]. Some professional players grew their beards out to show respect towards the God of Israel, while others wore false beards. They were known for their skill and played against some of the greatest teams in the country. The House of David played against Major League, Minor League, independent and [[Negro League]] teams, with all the same spirit of competition and fair play. At one point, the community had three separate barnstorming teams touring the country, playing and evangelizing wherever they went. The House of David teams were famous for inventing "pepper" baseball tricks, along the lines of the fancy basketball moves of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].

The House of David continued to sponsor barnstorming teams well into the 1930s and then sponsored weekend [[semi-professional]] teams until the 1940s. Mary's City of David sent out barnstorming teams from 1930 until 1940 and then again from 1946 until 1955. Throughout this period, there were numerous teams which bore the House of David name and wore beards. The most famous was probably the Black House of David, an all [[African-American]] "Barn-storming" team that played solely against teams of the Negro Leagues.

The House of David was the inspiration behind the [[James Sturm]] [[graphic novel]], ''The Golem's Mighty Swing'' (in which the team was called the "Stars of David") as well as [[Harry Turtledove]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The House of Daniel]]''. The House of David was also featured in a segment of [[Ken Burns]]' [[Baseball (TV series)|''Baseball'']] and in the movie ''[[The Winning Team]]'' (1952) about the life of pitcher [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]].

A [[vintage base ball]] club (the ''House of David Echoes BBC'') has been honoring the legacy of the House of David teams since 2001, playing vintage base ball under the 1858 rules while growing their beards and playing at historic Eastman Field near Benton Harbor, Michigan. For the 2016 season, the Echoes moved to the original 1914 baseball field at Eden Springs Park, and will continue to use the field for the foreseeable future.

==Musical bands==
[[File:House of David Band 1915.jpg|thumb|House of David Band in 1915.]]
The organization also fielded nationally known musical bands&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.israelitehouseofdavid.com/musical_traditions.html | publisher = Israelite house of David | title = Music}}.&lt;/ref&gt; between 1906 and 1927.  These [https://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3b22367/ bands toured the country] almost non-stop on the three top [[vaudeville]] circuits: the Pantages, the Keith and the Orpheum.

==Parks==
The House of David operated a world-famous zoo and [[amusement park]] in [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.houseofdavidmuseum.org/parktour/traindepotsouth.htm | publisher = House of David museum | title = Park tour | chapter = Train depot South | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070321224937/http://www.houseofdavidmuseum.org/parktour/traindepotsouth.htm | archivedate = 2007-03-21 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also established "The Springs of Eden Park" which became a popular Michigan vacation spot in the 1930s. A revamped version&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.edenspringsparkandcampground.com/ | title = Eden Springs Park}}.&lt;/ref&gt; opened in late 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ralph |last=Heibutzki |format=fee required |coauthors= |title=Train Rides and Many Memories |url=http://www.heraldpalladium.com/articles/2011/10/30/local_news/7069941.txt |work=[[The Herald-Palladium]] |publisher= |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2011-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it - as of 2015 - one of only a few known American amusement parks to have been successfully reopened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William F., III |last=Ast |format=fee required |coauthors= |title=Amusement Park Revival a Rare Thing  |url=http://www.heraldpalladium.com/news/local/amusement-park-revival-a-rare-thing/article_aa02742e-0fa0-55f9-bf1f-a6d74d632bb4.html |work=[[The Herald-Palladium]] |publisher= |date=2012-10-14 |accessdate=2012-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main attractions at The Springs of Eden Park was the coal powered miniature locomotives, purchased in 1908. Members of the commune originally observed similar locomotives at the [[1904 Worlds Fair]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miniature Trains|url=http://www.israelitehouseofdavid.com/html/miniature_trains.html|website=Israelite House of David website|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trains were used to carry people to the amusement park from the main entrance to the commune on Britain Avenue.&lt;ref name=TherHeraldGetnewlife&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ast|first1=William F.|title=House of David train getting new life|url=http://www.israelitehouseofdavid.com/html/HP_story.html|website=The Herald-Palladium|publisher=Israelite House of David|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional amusement at the park included miniature racing cars, restaurant, penny arcade, pony rides, and dances and shows at the amphitheater.&lt;ref name=TherHeraldGetnewlife/&gt;  

The park closed in the 1970s and the land lay fallow. In 2000, one of the trains was purchased by the [[List of ridable miniature railways|Northwest Ohio Railroad Preservation Group]], refurbished and in use at a railway museum in [[Findlay, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=TherHeraldGetnewlife/&gt;

==History==
While in modern history, the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Boxer Rebellion]], [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist Revolution]], and the [[Cultural Revolution]] contributed significantly to the rise of irreligion and distrust of organized religion among the general populace; irreligion in its various forms, especially [[rationalism]], [[secularism]], and [[antitheism]], has had a long history in China dating back millennia. The [[Zhou Dynasty]] ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' contains several catechistic poems in the ''Decade of Dang'' questioning the authority or existence of ''[[Shangdi]]''. Later philosophers such as [[Xun Zi]], [[Fan Zhen]], [[Han Fei]], [[Zhang Zai]], [[Wang Fuzhi]] also criticized the religious practices prevalent during their times. Buddhism flourished in China during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] Period. It was during this period that Fan Zhen wrote ''Shen Mie Lun'' ([[Simplified Chinese]] 神灭论, [[Traditional Chinese]] 神滅論, "''On the Annihilation of the [[Shen (Chinese religion)|Shen]]''") in reaction to Buddhist concepts of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|body-soul dualism]], ''[[samsara]]'' and ''[[karma]]''. He wrote that the soul is merely an effect or function of the body, and that there is no soul without the body (i.e., after the destruction and death of the body).&lt;ref&gt;Phil Zuckerman. ''Atheism and Secularity''. ABC-CLIO, 2009. p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he considered that cause-and-effect relationships claimed to be evidence of ''karma'' were merely the result of coincidence and bias. For this, he was exiled by the [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Emperor]].

[[Confucianism]] as a state-instituted philosophy has flourished in China since the [[Han Dynasty]], and the opportunities it offered was another fundamental origin of atheism in China. While there were periods in which Taoism and Buddhism may have been officially promoted, the status of Confucianism in Chinese society has rarely been challenged during imperial times. Extensive study of the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Confucian Classics]] was required to pass the [[Imperial examination|Imperial Civil Service Examinations]], and this was the major (and often sole) means by which one may achieve prominence in society. Confucianism places particular emphasis on [[humanism|humanistic]] and this-worldly social relations, rather than on an otherworldly soteriology.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Fingarette, ''Confucius: The Secular as Sacred'' (New York: Harper, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in global civil society |last= Juergensmeyer|first= Mark|year= 2005|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn=978-0-19-518835-6|page=70|quote=...humanist philosophies such as Confucianism, which do not share a belief in divine law and do not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produced a cultural tendency that facilitated acceptance of modern forms of irreligion such as humanism, secularism, and atheism.

China is considered to be a nation with a long history of [[humanism]], [[secularism]], and this-worldly thought since the time of [[Confucius]],&lt;ref name="Juergensmeyer, 2005. p. 70"&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer. ''Religion in Global Civil Society''. Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 70, quote: «[...] humanist philosophies such as Confucianism, which do not share a belief in divine law and do not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will [...]».&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Some scholars consider Confucianism as humanist and secularist. Rather, [[Herbert Fingarette]] has described it as a religion that "[[sacred|sacralises]] the secular".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Fingarette. ''Confucius: The Secular As Sacred''. Waveland, 1998. {{ISBN|1577660102}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} who stressed ''shisu'' (世俗 "being in the world"). [[Hu Shih]] stated in the 1920s that "China is a country without religion and the Chinese are a people who are not bound by religious superstitions."&lt;ref&gt;Yong Chen, 2012. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, after China's defeat in the [[First Opium War]] and in successive wars, the country succumbed to increasing domination by foreign imperialist powers. The Boxers (or the ''Yihetuan'') considered Christian missionaries as promoting foreign influence in China and held deep anti-Christian views. Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant missionaries and church members were massacred.

During the Cultural Revolution, a radical policy of anti-religion and anti-tradition was instituted. In the ensuing decade, the five major religions in China were severely suppressed. Many religious organizations were disbanded, property was confiscated or damaged, monks and nuns were sent home (or killed in violent [[struggle sessions]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Peng |date=2005-02-01 |publisher=Center for Northeast Asian Policy Studies, The Brookings Institution |title=Changing Chinese Attitudes Toward Religion and Culture: A Comparative Perspective |url=http://www.brookings.edu/fp/cnaps/events/liupeng20050201.pdf |page=3 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094024/http://www.brookings.edu/fp/cnaps/events/liupeng20050201.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Chinese economic reform|reforms]] of 1979, the government has liberalized religious policies to a degree, and the religious population has experienced some growth. Nevertheless, the irreligious remain the majority among all age groups in China. Local governments may even support certain local religious institutions and festivals in a bid to promote tourism. However, atheism, characterization of religions as superstition, the promotion of scientific rationalization remain core tenets of the ruling Communist Party.

The form ''Yerushalem'' or ''Yerushalayim'' (Jerusalem) first appears in the Bible, in the [[Book of Joshua]]. According to a [[Midrash]], the name is a combination of "'''Yireh'''" ("The abiding place", the name given by [[Abraham]] to the place where [[sacrifice of Isaac|he began to sacrifice his son]]) and "'''[[Salem (Bible)|Shalem]]'''" ("Place of Peace", given by high priest [[Shem]]), then the two names were united by God.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews|The Legends of the Jews]] [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf Volume I: The Akedah]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oldest inscriptions===
The earliest extra-biblical [[Hebrew]] writing of the word Jerusalem is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE&lt;ref&gt;''Writing, Literacy, and Textual Transmission: The Production of Literary'' by Jessica N. Whisenant p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''King Manasseh and Child Sacrifice: Biblical Distortions of Historical Realities'' by Francesca Stavrakopoulou p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; and was discovered in [[Khirbet Beit Lei]] near [[Beit Guvrin, Israel|Beit Guvrin]] in 1961. The inscription states: "I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem",&lt;ref&gt;''Oral World and Written Word: Ancient Israelite Literature'' by Susan Niditch p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Mountain of the Lord'' by Benyamin Mazar p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blessing and Curse in Syro-Palestinian Inscriptions'' by T. G Crawford p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; or as other scholars suggest: "Yahweh is the God of the whole earth.

Berrett p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jebus, Zion, City of David===
An ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the [[Gihon Spring]], was according to the Bible named [[Jebusite|Jebus]] (''e.g.'', Judges 19:10:יְב֔וּס הִ֖יא יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם: "Jebus, it [is] Jerusalem"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=DIV1&amp;byte=1012257 |title=Bible, King James Version |work=umich.edu |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=Gagrinp113&gt;{{Google books |id=lNV6-HsUppsC |page=113 |title=The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1}}, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Called the "Fortress of Zion" (''metsudat Zion''), it was renamed by David as the [[City of David]],&lt;ref&gt;2 Samuel 5:7,9. cited Israel Finkelstein, Amihay Mazar, Brian B. Schmidt, (eds) ''The Quest for the Historical Israel'', Society of Biblical Literature, 2007 p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; and was known by this name in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bar-Kochva |first=Bezalel |year=2002 |title=Judas Maccabeus: The Jewish Struggle Against the Seleucids |page=447 |url={{Google books |id=SIKuW_bl6LAC |page=447 |plainurl=yes}} |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-01683-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mazar |first=Eilat |title=The Complete Guide to the Temple Mount Excavations |year=2002 |publisher=Shoham Academic Research and Publication |location=Jerusalem |isbn=965-90299-1-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another name, "[[Zion]]", initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole and to represent the biblical [[Land of Israel]].

===Greek, Roman and Byzantine names===
In Greek and Latin the city's name was transliterated ''Hierosolyma'' (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek ''hieròs'', ''ἱερός'', means holy), although the city was renamed [[Aelia Capitolina]] for part of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period of its history.

===Salem===
The [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Genesis Apocryphon|Apocryphon of Genesis]] of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier "Salem" (שלם), said to be the kingdom of [[Melchizedek]] in Genesis 14:18. Other early Hebrew sources,&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', Jubilees 1:30, the [[Septuagint]] version of Jeremias 48:5 (as Συχὲμ) and possibly the Masoretic text of Genesis 33:18 (''see'' KJV and the margin translation of the Revised Version).&lt;/ref&gt; early Christian renderings of the verse&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', the [[Vulgate]] and [[Peshitta]] versions. J.A. Emerton, "The site of Salem: the City of Melchizedek (Genesis xiv 18)," pp. 45–72 of ''Studies in the Pentateuch'' ed. by J.A. Emerton, vol. 41 of ''Supplements to Vetus Testamentum'' (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1990) ("Emerton"), p. 45. ''See also'' John 3:23 where "Salim" or "Sylem" (Συχὲμ) is said to be near [[Ænon]], thought to be in the valley of [[Mount Ebal]], one of two mountains in the vicinity of Nablus.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[targumim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Targum Onkelos|Onklelos]], [[Pseudo-Jonathan]] and [[Targum Neofiti|Neofiti I]]. Emerton, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; however, put Salem in Northern Israel near [[Shechem]] (or Sichem), now [[Nablus]], a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 12:6–7 (where Abram built an altar), Genesis 33:18–20, Deuteronomy 11:29 &amp; 28:11, Joshua 8:33, 1 Kings 12. Emerton, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the [[Samaritans]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Winter, "Note on Salem – Jerusalem", ''Novum Testamentum'', vol. 2, pp. 151–52 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.templestudiesgroup.com/Papers/Robert_Hayward.pdf |last= Raymond Hayward |title= Melchizedek as Priest of the Jerusalem Temple in Talmud, Midrash, and Targum |publisher= The Temple Studies Group |access-date= 24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabic names===
In Arabic, Jerusalem is most commonly known as {{lang|ar|القُدس}}, transliterated as ''al-Quds'' and meaning "The Holy" or "The Holy Sanctuary".&lt;ref name=Bosworth/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeGarmo/&gt; Official Israeli government policy mandates that {{lang|ar|أُورُشَلِيمَ}}, transliterated as ''Ūršalīm'', which is the cognate of the Hebrew and English names, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with {{lang|ar|القُدس}}. {{lang|ar|أُورُشَلِيمَ-القُدس}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_main/defaultnew.asp?lng=3 |title=The Official Website of Jerusalem |date=19 September 2011 |publisher=Municipality of Jerusalem |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427222723/http://www.hotzvim.org.il/SiteFiles/1/35/901.asp |archivedate=27 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called "''Qudsi''" or "''Maqdisi''", while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a [[demonym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sonbol|first1=Amira|title=Women, the Family, and Divorce Laws in Islamic History|date=1996|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Jerusalem}}

Given the city's central position in both Jewish nationalism ([[Zionism]]) and [[Palestinian nationalism]], the selectivity required to summarize some 5,000 years of inhabited history is often influenced by ideological bias or background (see [[Historiography and nationalism]]).&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/02/17/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-ancient-settlement.html |title=Israeli Archaeologists Discover 7,000-Year-Old Settlement |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229012749/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/02/17/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-ancient-settlement.html |archive-date=29 February 2016 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |access-date=25 July 2018 |author=The Associated Press |author-link=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli/Jewish nationalists ([[Zionists]]) claim a right to the city based on Jewish indigeneity to the land, particularly their origins in and descent from the [[Israelites]] (see [[History of the Jews and Judaism in the Land of Israel]]), for whom Jerusalem is their capital, and their yearning for return.&lt;ref&gt;"No city in the world, not even Athens or Rome, ever played as great a role in the life of a nation for so long a time, as Jerusalem has done in the life of the Jewish people." [[David Ben-Gurion]], 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"For three thousand years, Jerusalem has been the center of Jewish hope and longing. No other city has played such a dominant role in the history, culture, religion and consciousness of a people as has Jerusalem in the life of Jewry and Judaism. Throughout centuries of exile, Jerusalem remained alive in the hearts of Jews everywhere as the focal point of Jewish history, the symbol of ancient glory, spiritual fulfillment and modern renewal. This heart and soul of the Jewish people engenders the thought that if you want one simple word to symbolize all of Jewish history, that word would be 'Jerusalem.'" [[Teddy Kollek]] (DC: Washington Institute For Near East Policy, 1990), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Palestinian nationalists claim the right to the city based on modern [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]' longstanding presence and descent from many different peoples who have settled or lived in the region over the centuries.&lt;ref name="International1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Quigley|authorlink=John Quigley (academic)|title=The Palestine Yearbook of International Law, 1996–1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-3PHZLwq7AC&amp;pg=PA32|date=1 July 1998|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-411-1009-7|pages=32–|quote=Palestine's claim to Jerusalem is founded on the longtime status of the Palestinian Arabs as the majority population of Palestine.

Acutely aware of the distinctiveness of Palestinian history, the Palestinians saw themselves as the heirs of its rich associations." [[Walid Khalidi]], 1984, ''Before Their Diaspora: A Photographic History of the Palestinians, 1876–1948''.

Any city, Jerusalem included, can be defined either in current administrative terms, as the area declared by legal means to be part of a municipality; or in historical terms, as the city which resulted from a process of urban development, united into one entity by a common territory, history and by virtue of its natural and social characteristics.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The administrative inclusion of several outlying towns and villages after 1967, which are not fully and organically included in the social, economic, and political fabric of Jerusalem proper, creates confusion regarding any definition of the city of Jerusalem.

The material culture of the region exhibits numerous common points between Israelites and Canaanites in the Iron I period (c. 1200–1000&amp;nbsp;BCE). The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature.

When [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], Jerusalem and [[Judea]] came under Macedonian control, eventually falling to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] under [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy I]]. In 198 BCE, [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] lost Jerusalem and Judea to the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] under [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]]. The [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] attempt to recast Jerusalem as a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenized]] [[polis|city-state]] came to a head in 168 BCE with the successful [[Maccabees|Maccabean revolt]] of [[Mattathias]] and his five sons against [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], and their establishment of the [[Hasmonean]] Kingdom in 152 BCE with Jerusalem as its capital.

A messianic [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] movement to gather in Jerusalem took place at the turn of the millennium, leading to a "Golden Age" of Karaite scholarship there, which was only terminated by the Crusades.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Sklare, 'Yūsuf al-Bașīr:Theological Aspects of his Halakhic Works,' in Daniel Frank (ed.) ''The Jews of Medieval Islam: Community, Society &amp; Identity'', E. J. Brill, 1995, pp. 249–270. p. 249. They were known as ''avelei șion'' (Mourners of Zion) or ''Shoshanim'' (Lilies(among the thorns))&lt;/ref&gt; In 1099, the Fatimid ruler expelled the native Christian population before Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|besieged]] by the soldiers of the [[First Crusade]]. After taking the solidly defended city by assault, the Crusaders massacred most of its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, and made it the capital of their [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. The city, which had been virtually emptied, was recolonized by a variegated inflow of [[Greeks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Hungarians]], [[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Syrians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Nestorians]], [[Maronites]], [[Jacob Baradeus|Jacobite]] Miaphysites, [[Copts]] and others, to block the return of the surviving Muslims and Jews.

In 1517, Jerusalem and environs fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], who generally remained in control until 1917.&lt;ref name="century1"/&gt; Jerusalem enjoyed a prosperous period of renewal and peace under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]—including the rebuilding of magnificent walls around the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. Throughout much of Ottoman rule, Jerusalem remained a provincial, if religiously important center, and did not straddle the main trade route between [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;Amnon Cohen. "Economic Life in Ottoman Jerusalem"; Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The English reference book ''Modern history or the present state of all nations'', written in 1744, stated that "Jerusalem is still reckoned the capital city of Palestine, though much fallen from its ancient grandeaur".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern history or the present state of all nations|last=Salmon|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Salmon (historian)|page=461|year=1744|url={{Google books |id=f7I-AAAAcAAJ |page=534 |plainurl=yes}} |accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans brought many innovations: modern postal systems run by the various consulates and regular stagecoach and carriage services were among the first signs of modernization in the city.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jeru.huji.ac.il/eh1.htm |title=The Ottoman Period (1517-1917 CE) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231040026/http://jeru.huji.ac.il/eh1.htm |archive-date=31 December 2009 |work=[[Hebrew University]] |year=2002 |access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 19th century, the Ottomans constructed the first paved road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and by 1892 the railroad had reached the city.&lt;ref name="multiref1"/&gt;

With the annexation of Jerusalem by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] in 1831, foreign missions and consulates began to establish a foothold in the city. In 1836, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] allowed Jerusalem's Jewish residents to restore four major synagogues, among them the [[Hurva Synagogue|Hurva]].&lt;ref name="multiref2"&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In the countrywide [[Peasants' Revolt of 1834 (Palestine)|Peasants' Revolt]], [[Qasim al-Ahmad]] led his forces from [[Nablus]] and attacked Jerusalem, aided by the [[Abu Ghosh]] clan, and entered the city on 31 May 1834.

Ottoman rule was reinstated in 1840, but many Egyptian Muslims remained in Jerusalem and Jews from [[Algiers]] and North Africa began to settle in the city in growing numbers.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt; In the 1840s and 1850s, the international powers began a tug-of-war in Palestine as they sought to extend their protection over the region's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through consular representatives in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', Jerusalem, Keter, 1978, Volume 9, "State of Israel (Historical Survey)", pp. 304–306&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Prussian consul, the population in 1845 was 16,410, with 7,120 Jews, 5,000 Muslims, 3,390 Christians, 800 Turkish soldiers and 100 Europeans.&lt;ref name="multiref2"/&gt; The volume of Christian pilgrims increased under the Ottomans, doubling the city's population around Easter time.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem: Illustrated History Atlas'' Martin Gilbert, Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1978, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, new neighborhoods [[Expansion of Jerusalem in the 19th century|began to develop]] outside the Old City walls to house pilgrims and relieve the intense overcrowding and poor sanitation inside the city.

Until the 1880s there were no formal orphanages in Jerusalem, as families generally took care of each other. In 1881 the [[Diskin Orphanage]] was founded in Jerusalem with the arrival of Jewish children orphaned by a Russian [[pogrom]].

The British had to deal with a conflicting demand that was rooted in Ottoman rule. Agreements for the supply of water, electricity, and the construction of a tramway system—all under concessions granted by the Ottoman authorities—had been signed by the city of Jerusalem and a Greek citizen, Euripides Mavromatis, on 27 January 1914. Work under these concessions had not begun and, by the end of the war the British occupying forces refused to recognize their validity. Mavromatis claimed that his concessions overlapped with the Auja Concession that the government had awarded to Rutenberg in 1921 and that he had been deprived of his legal rights. The Mavromatis concession, in effect despite earlier British attempts to abolish it, covered Jerusalem and other localities (e.g., Bethlehem) within a radius of {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.&lt;ref&gt;Shamir, Ronen (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine.

The war of 1948 resulted in the division of Jerusalem, so that the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] lay entirely on the Jordanian side of the [[Green Line (Israel)|line]]. A no-man's land between East and West Jerusalem came into being in November 1948: [[Moshe Dayan]], commander of the Israeli forces in Jerusalem, met with his Jordanian counterpart [[Abdullah el-Tell]] in a deserted house in Jerusalem's [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Musrara]] neighborhood and marked out their respective positions: Israel's position in red and Jordan's in green. This rough map, which was not meant as an official one, became the final [[Green Line (Israel)|line]] in the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], which divided the city and left [[Mount Scopus]] as an Israeli [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] inside [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jposttravel.com/jerusalem_tours/FormerIsrael1008.html |title=No Man's Land |publisher=Jposttravel.com |accessdate=11 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124081714/http://jposttravel.com/jerusalem_tours/FormerIsrael1008.html |archivedate=24 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbed wire and concrete barriers ran down the center of the city, passing close by [[Jaffa Gate]] on the western side of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]], and a crossing point was established at [[Mandelbaum Gate]] slightly to the north of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]].

{{main|Reunification of Jerusalem}}
[[File:EastJerusalemMap.svg|thumb|Map of East Jerusalem (2010)]]
In 1967, despite Israeli pleas that Jordan remain neutral during the [[Six-Day War]], [[Six-Day War#West Bank|Jordan, which had concluded a defense agreement with Egypt on May 30, 1967, attacked Israeli-held West Jerusalem on the war's second day]]. After hand-to-hand fighting between Israeli and Jordanian soldiers on the [[Temple Mount]], the [[Israel Defense Forces]] captured East Jerusalem, along with the entire West Bank. On 27 June 1967, three weeks after the war ended, in the [[reunification of Jerusalem]], Israel extended its law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, including the city's Christian and Muslim holy sites, along with some nearby West Bank territory which comprised 28 Palestinian villages, incorporating it into the Jerusalem Municipality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/13+Law+and+Administration+Ordinance+-Amendment+No.htm |title=13 Law and Administration Ordinance – Amendment No |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Rabinovich, ''For Jerusalem: 49 years later true unity remains elusive'', in Jerusalem Post, 11 June 2016 [http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/For-Jerusalem-455837]&lt;/ref&gt; although it carefully avoided using the term annexation. On 10 July, Foreign Minister Abba Eban explained to the UN Secretary General: "''The term 'annexation' which was used by supporters of the vote is not accurate. The steps that were taken [by Israel] relate to the integration of Jerusalem in administrative and municipal areas, and served as a legal basis for the protection of the holy places of Jerusalem."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=DA4-XPy-6hIC |page=53 |title=Jerusalem Syndrome – The Palestinian–Israeli Battle for the Holy City}}, pp. 53–54. Mosheh ʻAmirav, Sussex University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Israel conducted a census of Arab residents in the areas annexed. Residents were given permanent residency status and the option of applying for Israeli citizenship.

Jewish and Christian access to the holy sites inside the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|old walled city]] was restored. Israel left the [[Temple Mount]] under the jurisdiction of an Islamic ''[[waqf]]'', but opened the [[Western Wall]] to Jewish access.

After the Six-Day War the population of Jerusalem increased by 196%. The Jewish population grew by 155%, while the Arab population grew by 314%.

The plan was intended to [[Judaization of Jerusalem|make East Jerusalem more Jewish]] and prevent it from becoming part of an urban Palestinian bloc stretching from [[Bethlehem]] to [[Ramallah]]. On 2 October 1977, the [[Cabinet of Israel|Israeli cabinet]] approved the plan, and seven neighborhoods were subsequently built on the city's eastern edges. They became known as the [[Ring Neighborhoods, Jerusalem|Ring Neighborhoods]]. Other Jewish neighborhoods were built within East Jerusalem, and Israeli Jews also settled in Arab neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon, Gilad: ''Sharon: The Life of a Leader'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowen|first=Jeremy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10656890|title=House-by-house struggle for East Jerusalem|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 September 2010|date=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the creation of the State of Israel, Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of [[Mandatory Palestine]], which included present-day Israel and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem as administrative capital of the British Mandate:

From 1949 until 1967, West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognized as such internationally because [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN General Assembly Resolution 194]] envisaged Jerusalem as an [[international city]]. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of [[Levi Eshkol]] extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm |title=Jerusalem in International Diplomacy |author=[[Dore Gold]] |accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its proximity to the city, especially the [[Temple Mount]], [[Abu Dis]], a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, Mitchell G. ''Will Israel Survive?''&lt;/ref&gt;

===International status===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
While the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the [[occupied Palestinian territories]], neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognized as part of the territory of Israel or the [[State of Palestine]]. Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] adopted by the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a [[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]] administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948, the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by [[Jordan]]. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city.

===Status under Israeli rule===
[[File:Israel Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supreme Court of Israel]]]]

Following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.

In 2010, Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritized construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism, and cultural events more affordable.

In biblical times, Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. Over centuries of warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the Jerusalem region thus built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Demographics==

===Demographic history===
{{Main|Demographic history of Jerusalem}}
Jerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000 year history. Since medieval times, the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem has been divided into [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish]], [[Muslim Quarter|Muslim]], [[Christian Quarter|Christian]], and [[Armenian Quarter|Armenian quarters]].

Most population data pre-1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the [[Jerusalem District]].&lt;ref&gt;Usiel Oskar Schmelz, in Ottoman Palestine, 1800–1914: studies in economic and social history, Gad G. Gilbar, Brill Archive, 1990 {{Google books |id=sdYUAAAAIAAJ |title=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These estimates suggest that since the end of the [[Crusades]], Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.

Between 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.

===Current demographics===

The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City's 32,488 people were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/09/26/mideast.jerusalem.reut/index.html |title=Arab population growth outpaces Jews in Jerusalem |author=[[Reuters]] |date=26 September 2000 |access-date=25 July 2018 |work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24741524|title=Israel approves new East Jerusalem settlement homes|work=BBC News|accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former [[Soviet Union]]. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] and [[Arab people|Arab]] communities. Consequently, the [[total fertility rate]] in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;

In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; This would seem to corroborate the observation that the percentage of Jews in Jerusalem has declined over the past four decades. In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3254277,00.html|publisher=YNet|title=Jerusalem: More tourists, fewer Jews|accessdate=10 March 2007|last=Sel|first=Neta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] are leaving in higher numbers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The percentage of secular Jews, or those who 'wear their faith lightly' is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012).

While some Israelis avoid Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, the city has attracted Palestinians, offering more jobs and opportunity than any city in the [[West Bank]] or [[Gaza Strip]].

Residents also are entitled to the subsidized healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighborhood has one, and universities.

Demographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the [[Jerusalem Development Authority]] proposed expanding city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.&lt;ref name="laub2006"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/02/AR2006120200463_pf.html|title=Jerusalem Barrier Causes Major Upheaval|date=2 December 2006|publisher=The Associated Press via The Washington Post|last=Laub|first=Karin|accessdate=10 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012, it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. Currently, the city's birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PEGGY CIDOR |url=http://www.jpost.com/InJerusalem/CityFront/Article.aspx?id=270431 |title=Jerusalem 2012 – the state of things|publisher=Jpost.com |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/155980 |title=Jewish Birthrate Up, Arab Rate Down in Jerusalem – Inside Israel – News |publisher=Israel National News |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighborhood of [[Pisgat Ze'ev]] and constituted three percent of the population in [[Neve Ya'akov]]. In the [[French Hill]] neighborhood, Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Hubbard |url=http://www.cjp.org/page.aspx?id=206230 |title=Holy city twist: Arabs moving into Jewish areas |work=Cjp.org |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730093730/http://www.cjp.org/page.aspx?id=206230 |archive-date=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem's residents. Of these, 195,500 (43%) are Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), 260,800 (57%) are Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jiis.org/.upload/facts-2010-eng%20%281%29.pdf |format=PDF|title=Jerusalem, Facts and Trends 2009–2010, p. 11 |publisher=Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.&lt;ref name="ap2008-02-09"&gt;{{cite web |title = Palestinians grow by a million in decade|publisher = The Jerusalem Post/AP |date = 9 February 2008 |url = http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=91497 |accessdate = 18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerusalem's Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 21% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]] comprise 30% of the city's adult Jewish population.

===Urban planning issues===
Critics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Hodgkins, "The Judaization of Jerusalem – Israeli Policies Since 1967"; PASSIA publication No. 101, December 1996, (English, p. 88)&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[World Bank]] report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighborhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and "the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators" than Jewish violators of the permit process.&lt;ref name="worldbank"/&gt; In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the [[City of David]] archaeological park in the 60% Arab neighborhood of [[Silwan]] (adjacent to the Old City),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Meron |last=Rapoport |url=http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=530047&amp;contrassID=1 |title=Land lords |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=20 January 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220142640/http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=530047&amp;contrassID=1 |archive-date=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Tolerance]] on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWESTBANKGAZA/Resources/WestBankrestrictions9Mayfinal.pdf "Movement and Access Restrictions in the West Bank: Uncertainty and Inefficiency"]; World Bank Technical Team, 9 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esther Zandberg.[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/825662.html "The architectural conspiracy of silence"]; Haaretz, 24 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protecting Jerusalem's Holy Sites: A Strategy for Negotiating a Sacred Peace|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2 October 2006|edition=1st|last=Guinn|first=David E.|isbn=0-521-86662-6|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy.

Jerusalem has been sacred to the Jews since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE.{{refn|group=note|name=bible-david}} Jerusalem was the site of [[Solomon's Temple]] and the Second Temple.&lt;ref name="1000BCE"/&gt; Although not mentioned in the [[Torah]] / [[Pentateuch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3136760,00.html|title=Parshat Re'eh: No Jerusalem in Torah – Israel Opinion, Ynetnews|publisher=Ynetnews.com|date=20 June 1995|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is mentioned in the Bible 632 times.

Many Jews have "[[Mizrah|Mizrach]]" plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer.&lt;ref name="returning"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish injunction to pray toward Jerusalem comes in the ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' section of ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (94:1) – "When one rises to pray anywhere in the Diaspora, he should face towards the Land of Israel, directing himself also toward Jerusalem, the Temple, and the Holy of Holies."&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its [[Old Testament]] history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the [[New Testament]], Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]]: "And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought [Jesus] to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;" ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 2:22)&lt;/ref&gt; and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]]: "And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;" ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 11:15)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cenacle]], believed to be the site of Jesus' [[Last Supper]], is located on [[Mount Zion]] in the same building that houses the [[David's Tomb|Tomb of King David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem in the Time of the Crusades|last=Boas|first=Adrian J.|publisher=Routledge|date=12 October 2001|isbn=0-415-23000-4|page=112|chapter=Physical Remains of Crusader Jerusalem|quote=The interesting, if not reliable illustrations of the church on the round maps of Jerusalem show two distinct buildings on Mount Zion: the church of St Mary and the Cenacle (Chapel of the Last Supper) appear as separate buildings.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Life of Jesus|last=Endo|first=Shusaku|authorlink=Shusaku Endo|isbn=0-8091-2319-3|year=1999|editor=Richard A.

===High-rise construction===
Jerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a [[skyscraper]] by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/statistics/tallest-buildings-jerusalem-israel |title=Jerusalem's tallest buildings – Top 20 &amp;#124; Statistics |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/holylandtower2-jerusalem-israel |title=Holyland Tower 2 &amp;#124; Buildings |location=Jerusalem / |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem.

One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel.

Contradicting the Christian concept of Jesus' "[[Atonement in Christianity|atonement of mankind's sins]]" through his death on the cross, Hubbard states in the ''[[Volunteer Ministers]] Handbook'' that "Man is basically good, but he could not attain expression of this until now. Nobody but the individual could die for his own [[sin]]s – to arrange things otherwise was to keep man in chains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ankerberg  | first =John   |author2=John Weldon | title =Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs | publisher =Harvest House Publishers | year =1996 | page =Section: Beliefs Behind the "Seens" - A New Age Way of Seeing | url =http://www.simplechurchhappens.net/Resources/Books/Encyclopedia%20of%20New%20Age%20Beliefs%20-%20John%20Ankerberg%20&amp;%20John%20Weldon.doc
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual state of Jesus==
In Scientology, Jesus is classified as below the level of [[Operating Thetan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Urban  | first = Hugh B.  | title = Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Religion   | volume = 74   | issue = 2  | pages = 356–389  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  |date=June 2006  | doi = 10.1093/jaarel/lfj084}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described by L. Ron Hubbard as being a "shade above" the condition of "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]],"&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cabal" /&gt;similar to the group’s view of Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4IDPV2hZL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=scientology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo-oHG1IHeAhWUGjQIHU2YDVIQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology&amp;f=false|title=Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief|last=Wright|first=Lawrence|date=2013-01-17|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780385350273|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to R. Philip Roberts in ''The Apologetics Study Bible'', "Scientology's upper-level materials tout the concept of Jesus as God as being a fiction that ought to be removed by '[[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]'".&lt;ref name="cabal" /&gt;

==Jesus and reincarnation==
According to Scientology, as written by Walter Martin in ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', there is a possibility that Jesus believed in reincarnation: "There is much speculation on the part on the part of religious historians as to the early education of Jesus of Nazareth. It is believed by many authorities that Jesus was a member of the cult of Essenes, who believed in reincarnation." Hubbard also linked Hindu teachings to Jesus. Walter Martin also mentions that the apostle Peter has, long ago, denied mythologies and fables attributed to Christ. "We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty" (2 Peter 1:16)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first1=Walter |title=The Kingdom of the Cults |editor-last=Zacharias |editor-first=Ravi |location=Bloomington, Minnesota |publisher=Bethany House Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=978-0764228216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesus as an implant==
{{main|Implant (Scientology)}}
In the 2008 book ''Vintage Jesus: Timeless Answers to Timely Questions'', authors [[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]] and Gerry Breshears write: "According to Scientology, Jesus is an 'implant' forced upon a [[thetan]] about a million years ago".&lt;ref name="driscoll"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Driscoll  | first =Mark   |author2=Gerry Breshears |authorlink=Mark Driscoll (pastor) | title =Vintage Jesus: Timeless Answers to Timely Questions  | publisher =Good News Publishers  | year =2008  | pages =14, 183  | isbn = 1-58134-975-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'', Jon Atack writes "In confidential issues, Hubbard dismissed Christian teaching as an 'implant.' ... In confidential materials Hubbard attacked Christianity as an 'implant,' and said that Christ was a fiction."&lt;ref name="atack"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Atack  | first =Jon  | title =[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]  | publisher =Carol Publishing Group  | year =1990  | location =New York  | pages =376, 383  | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard is quoted as stating that [[Christianity]] evolved from the "[[Xenu|R6 Implant]]": "The man on the cross. There was no [[Christ]]! The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], through watching the dramatizations of people picked up some little fragments of R6."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Corydon  | first =Bent  |author2=Brian Ambry | title =[[L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?]] | publisher =Barricade Books | year =1992 | page =353 | isbn = 0-942637-57-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard described the belief that the Christian heaven is “the product of two implants dating back more than 43 trillion years.” He said further that heaven is a “false dream” that leads thetans to a goal that does not exist, and persuades them of the singularity of this life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sappell|first1=Joel|last2=Welkos|first2=Robert W.|title=Defining the Theology|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-scientologysidea062490-story.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jesus in OT VIII==
{{main|OT VIII}}
[[Operating Thetan]] level VIII is highest level of auditing level in Scientology.  It is known as "The Truth Revealed".  It was initially released to select high-ranking public Scientologists in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2014/06/24/up-the-bridge-we-finally-reach-ot-8-but-was-its-first-version-really-a-hoax/&lt;/ref&gt;

In OT VIII, dated 1980, Hubbard explains the document is intended for circulation only after his death.  Its purpose is to explain the untold story of Hubbard's life's work.&lt;ref&gt;"By the time you read this I will no longer be occupying the body and identity that you have known as Ron."&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard explains that the reader has "undoubtedly heard pieces of data over the years that hinted at the greater untold reality of my mission here on Earth" but "the story was never written, nor spoken...  It  is only now that I feel it safe to release the information".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/Declaration/ot8b.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the document, Hubbard teaches that "the historic Jesus was not nearly the sainted figure [he] has been made out to be.   In addition to being a lover of young boys and men, he was given to uncontrollable bursts of temper and hatred".&lt;ref&gt;http://tonyortega.org/2014/06/24/up-the-bridge-we-finally-reach-ot-8-but-was-its-first-version-really-a-hoax&lt;/ref&gt;  Hubbard mentions the [[Book of Revelation]] and its prophecy of a time when "an arch-enemy of Christ, referred to as the anti-Christ, will reign".   According to Hubbard, the "anti-Christ represents the forces of Lucifer".   Hubbard writes "My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief anti-Christ period."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/wakefield/christians.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views of Scientologists ==
In an interview with ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'', actress [[Mimi Rogers]] explained how her identity as a Scientologist helped her with the character Sharon in the [[1991 in film|1991]] psychological/religious drama [[film]] ''[[The Rapture (1991 film)|The Rapture]]''.&lt;ref name="bee"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Masullo | first =Robert A.  | title =Mimi Rogers Finds Strength in "Rapture's" Heavy Role | work =[[The Sacramento Bee|Sacramento Bee]] | page =EN14 | date =1991-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "I don't, for example, have a Jesus Christ definition of God ... And I have no views on [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. To me they're alien concepts. If I were a practicing [[Christian]] or a [[Jew]], with all the hang-ups of those religions, I don't think I could have done Sharon justice" said Rogers.&lt;ref name="bee" /&gt;

In 1997, celebrity Scientologist [[Lisa Marie Presley]] hosted a [[Christmas]] party at a Church of Scientology mission in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="waters"&gt;{{cite news
  | last =Waters  | first =David  | title =Lisa Marie Plays Scientology Santa  | work =[[The Commercial Appeal]]  | page =D6  | date =December 13, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 100 children attended the event, which Scientology officials stated was Presley's idea.&lt;ref name="waters" /&gt; Church of Scientology administrator Peggy Crawford asserted to ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'': "Some Scientologists are Christians and believe Jesus was divine. Some don't. We believe Christianity is not the only way.&lt;ref name="waters" /&gt;

Scientology minister-in-training and professed Christian, Craig Gehring, was quoted in 2007 in ''[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]'' as saying he thought that his belief in Jesus as the son of God did not conflict with his being a Scientologist: "Personally, I believe [Jesus is] the son of God - son of man, but like I said, that is not a Scientology doctrine. There isn't a doctrine about [Jesus] in Scientology."&lt;ref name="taylor" /&gt; I believe very much in the Christian message. Jesus says time and time again, 'The kingdom of God is at hand.' ... And that is a message you will find any Scientologist working toward."&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite news  | last =Taylor  | first =William  | title =BR man finds Scientology enhances his Christianity   | work =[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]  | page =01E  | publisher =Capital City Press  | date =February 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gehring said that during his time studying Scientology at the [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] mission, he had not encountered teachings of [[Space opera in Scientology scripture|Scientology space opera]] as had been reported in 2006 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.&lt;ref name="taylor" /&gt;

Hubbard discounted the Christian belief of the Holy Trinity. According to his Phoenix Lectures, “The Christian god is actually much better characterized in the Vedic Hymns [Hinduism] than in any subsequent publication, including the Old Testament.” He goes on to say that the Christian god is much more like the Hindu Veda than the Hebrew god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first1=Walter |title=The Kingdom of the Cults |editor-last=Zacharias |editor-first=Ravi |publisher=Baker Books |year=2003 |isbn=9780764228216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==
In the book ''New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America'' (1995) by [[Mary Farrell Bednarowski]], the author comments that "In the game of life as Scientology understands it, sin does not call for repentance as much as it does the eradication of error, and that must come through the technology, the auditing process, sometimes referred to as pastoral counseling. In fact, in regard to getting rid of sin, Scientology sees parallels between the goals of its technology and Jesus's saving action."&lt;ref name="bednarowski"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Bednarowski  | first =Mary Farrell   | title = New Religions and the Theological Imagination in America  | publisher =Indiana University Press   | year =1995  | page =61  | isbn =0-253-20952-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bednarowski quotes from the Scientology publication ''The Scientology Catechism'' in noting these parallels between the stated mission of Scientologists and the teachings imparted by Christ to his disciples.&lt;ref name="bednarowski" /&gt; She notes that Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] is not regarded in Scientology as a "divine savior", but rather a "loved friend and teacher".&lt;ref name="bednarowski" /&gt; Writing in ''Signs of the Times: The New Religious Movements in Theological Perspective'' (1996), [[John A. Saliba]] cites Mary Bednarowski, and goes on to note "Helle Medgaard asserts that Scientology also misunderstands Jesus and repudiates the key Christian doctrine of the forgiveness of sins."&lt;ref name="saliba"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Saliba  | first =John A  | author-link = John A.

In 1997, Scientology administrator Peggy Crawford said in a statement to ''The Commercial Appeal'': "We definitely believe in God and we believe in individuals as spiritual beings."&lt;ref name="dries"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Dries  | first =Bill  | title =Scientology May Fit In, Say Local Religious Leaders  | work =[[The Commercial Appeal]]  | page =A1  | date =September 4, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Paul Blankenship of the [[Memphis Theological Seminary]] studied Scientology and commented on this view, saying "They do not do a lot of talking about God or Jesus. It's more getting your mind cleared, and I could see how they could say that that could be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition. They may very well develop."&lt;ref name="dries" /&gt;

Reverend Raymond Guterman of the Northwood Presbyterian Church in [[Clearwater, Florida]], gave a sermon in 2001 titled: "Why Scientology Isn't a Church".&lt;ref name="oneil"&gt;{{cite news   | last =O'Neil  | first =Deborah  | title =Scientology in sermon raises eyebrows   | work =[[St. Petersburg Times]]|page=1  | date =September 8, 2001  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm not anti-Scientology; I'm not pro-Scientology. I just don't exactly understand individually why it's called the Church of Scientology and why there would be a cross, even if it's a different cross. When I see the cross, I think of Christ. If Christ is not the center of Scientology, then why would an organization use the cross and call itself a church? I'm just wondering, but I don't really plan to say any of that Sunday," said Reverend Guterman.&lt;ref name="oneil" /&gt; He explained that in his view Scientology was not a "church" because it did not follow the words of Jesus Christ and accept him as savior, and for this reason said "in my opinion, it's not a church."&lt;ref name="oneil" /&gt; Scientology representative Pat Harney contacted Reverend Guterman, and told the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' she thought he was using Scientology in order to generate interest.&lt;ref name="oneil" /&gt; "There's a definition of 'church' in the dictionary. It's called a congregation. There's a definition of the word 'church' that applies. I understand his Christian perspective. In truth, the derivation of the word 'church' predates Christianity," said Harney.&lt;ref name="oneil" /&gt; The ''St. Petersburg Times'' noted Reverend Guterman's public discussion of Scientology in such a manner was "virtually unheard of" in Clearwater, Florida, due to the large presence of Scientology in the area.&lt;ref name="oneil" /&gt;

[[Calvin Miller (author)|Calvin Miller]] comments in ''Miracles and Wonders'' (2003) that L. Ron Hubbard "held to such odd notions, blending his Jesus with 'spacey theology.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Miller   | first =Calvin  | title =Miracles and Wonders  | publisher =FaithWords  | year =2003  | page =91  | isbn = 0-446-53010-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality]]'' (2004), [[Bob Larson]] points out that "In his 1952 book entitled ''[[Scientology: A History of Man]]'' Hubbard even adapted the words of Jesus as found in Matthew 11:5 to describe his new teaching."&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Larson  | first =Bob  | authorlink =Bob Larson  | title =[[Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality]]  | publisher =Tyndale House Publishers  | year =2004  | pages =431–436 | isbn =978-0-8423-6417-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Steven Hutson writes in ''What They Never Taught You in Sunday School'' (2006) that "The Church of Scientology recognizes Jesus as ''one part'' of its 'religious heritage.' And this same 'heritage' also includes Zoroaster (an ancient Persian prophet), Socrates (the Greek sage), and a wide assortment of other philosophies and 
religions."&lt;ref name="hutson" /&gt;

While Hubbard put into question where the Bible originated from, Scientology claims that “it does not conflict with other religions or religious practices, as it clarifies them and brings understanding of the spiritual nature of Man.” Martin and Zacharias write in ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]] (2003),'' differentiating the truth in Scientology and in Jesus’ teachings. While Jesus gave “an objective standard of truth: himself,” Hubbard said “Know thyself and the truth shall set you free,” expressing the subjectivity and existentiality of truth in Scientology, compared to the centrality of Jesus in the pursuit of truth in Christianity. Martin and Zacharias further note that there are significant contradictions between the Bible and the writings of Scientology and that Jesus "gave no credence to other scriptures or distorted views of God."&lt;ref&gt;The Kingdom of the Cults by Walter Martin and Ravi Zacharias, Baker Books, Oct 2003.{{ISBN|0764228218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. Philip Roberts]] writes in ''The Apologetics Study Bible'' (2007): "Scientology makes occasional reference to Jesus Christ in its writings and uses as its symbol a cross with starbursts at each end. But even though it refers to itself as a church and may at times use Christian terminology and symbolism, it is clearly nonbiblical in its view of God, Jesus, Scripture, salvation, and other important doctrines."&lt;ref name="cabal"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Cabal  | first =Ted  |author2=Chad Owen Brand |author3=Paul Copan   | title =The Apologetics Study Bible  | publisher =Holman Bible Publishers   | year =2007  | page =1745   | isbn = 978-1-58640-024-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts goes on to note that "Scientology does not accept the biblical concepts of Jesus as God the Word incarnate. It also places no emphasis on the substitutionary death and resurrection of Jesus. Rather, it views Jesus as a proponent of reincarnation and other Eastern mystical concepts."&lt;ref name="cabal" /&gt; In his 2007 book ''The Bible Answer Book for Students'', author [[Hank Hanegraaff]] writes: "Although the church claims to be compatible with Christianity, the two belief structures &amp;ndash; one rooted in science fiction, the other in [[Soteriology|soteriological]] [[fact]] &amp;ndash; are contradictory and can't be harmonized."&lt;ref name="hanegraaff"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Hanegraaff  | first =Hank | author-link = Hank Hanegraaff | title =The Bible Answer Book for Students  | publisher =Thomas Nelson  | year =2007  | page = 194  | isbn =978-1-4041-0450-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanegraaff explains the nature of the Scientology concepts of [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]], [[Engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], and [[thetan]]s, and concludes: "Scientology is a rejection of the biblical doctrines of creation, original sin, and exclusive salvation through Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="hanegraaff" /&gt;

The Church of Scientology claims that their belief system is different from Christianity because it is based “solely on reason” and that its members “possess a practical system of ethics and justice.” The church likewise claims that “anything religious teachers said or Buddha promised, even the visions of Christianity, are attained in Scientology as a result.” Muck, Netland and McDermott emphasize that this clearly shows that Scientology is incompatible with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muck |first1=Terry C. |last2=Netland |first2=Harold A. |last3=McDermott |first3=Gerald R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ry_aBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT661&amp;dq=scientology+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiExuazrOnMAhWk6YMKHdGADCE4ChDoAQhGMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology%20religion&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Religion: A Christian Engagement with Traditions, Teachings, and Practices |publisher=Baker Academic |year=2014 |isbn=9781441246004 |accessdate=2016-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jinēndra Varṇī''', one of the best-known [[Jain]] scholars of the 20th century,  is known for his pioneering five-volume ''Jainendra Siddhanta Kosha'' and ''[[Saman Suttam]]'' compilation,&lt;ref&gt;Progressive Jains of India By Satish Kumar Jain, 1975,
Shraman Sahitya Sansthan&lt;/ref&gt; the first text accepted by all Jain orders in 1800 years.

Jinēndra Varṇī was born in [[Panipat]] in 1922 to a prominent [[Agrawal Jain]] family. He struggled all his life with health problems. In 1938 he lost one [[lung]] due to [[tuberculosis]]. Still he studied electrical and wireless [[engineering]].

Jinēndra Varṇī left home in 1957 and during his wanderings he joined the well-known [[Ganesh Varni]], who ordained him a [[Kshullak|kṣullaka]] or [[Jain monasticism|junior monk]]. However, he was unable to follow the [[vrata]]s of a ''kṣullaka'' due to his health problems and returned to being a [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]].

In 1983, approaching death, Jinēndra Varṇī began [[Sallekhana]] on 12 April 1983 and was ordained again a ''kṣullaka'' by [[Acharya Vidyasagar]]. He died in [[samadhi|samādhi]] on 24 May 1983.

==Saman Suttam==

Saman Suttam is the religious text created in 1974 by a committee consisting of representatives of each of the major sects of Jainism to reconcile the teachings of the sects. After a gap of about nearly two thousand years following composition of [[Tattvartha Sutra]] by [[Acharya]] [[Umasvati]] this was the first text to be recognized by all Jain sects. At Umaswati's time, although multiple orders existed, there was no clear sectarian division. By the 21st century however, Jainism had gradually been divided into several sects. For someone to compile a text at this time, and for it to be approved by all sects, was an exceptional event.

Jinendra Varni compiled a book, drawing from the original [[prakrit]] (ardha-magadhi etc.) texts. It was critically examined by several monks of different orders including Muni (now Acharya) [[Vidyanandaji]], Muni (later Acharya) [[Acharya Sushil Kumar|Sushil Kumar]]ji, Muni Janakavijaya, Muni Nathamal (now Acharya [[Mahaprajna]]), as well as scholars like A.N. Upadhye, Darbari Lal Kothia, Agarachand Nahta etc. Finally in an assembly on 12 December 1974 it was approved by all.

The text includes 44 chapters with topics such as Mangal Sutra (on auspiciousness), Atma Sutra (on the soul), Moksha Marga Sutra (on the path to liberation) etc.

The following verse is taken from section 37 "Anekanta-Sutra". The original text is in Prakrit.

==Career==
[[File:John Cusack Headshot.jpg|thumb|right|Cusack in 1997]]
Cusack began acting in films in the early 1980s. He made his breakout role in [[Rob Reiner]]'s ''[[The Sure Thing]]'' (1985). He also starred in [[Cameron Crowe]]'s directorial debut film, ''[[Say Anything...]]'' (1989). Cusack played a con artist in [[Stephen Frears]]' 1990 neo-noir film ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]''. After establishing New Crime Productions, Cusack co-wrote the screenplay for and starred in [[George Armitage]]'s crime film ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1126190 "Actor John Cusack."] NPR.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Spike Jonze]]'s fantasy film ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' (1999), Cusack played a puppeteer who finds a portal leading into the mind of the eponymous actor, [[John Malkovich]]. The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], including Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress. Cusack was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for his performance in ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'' (2000). In [[Roland Emmerich]]'s disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' (2009), he played a family novelist who attempts to survive the apocalypse and save mankind. Cusack played [[Edgar Allan Poe]] in [[James McTeigue]]'s biopic film ''[[The Raven (2012 film)|The Raven]]'' (2012) and starred in [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Maps to the Stars]]'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julianne Moore, John Cusack, Sarah Gadon Join Robert Pattinson and in Maps to the Stars|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=103159|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he starred in [[video on demand]] films, including ''[[The Factory (2012 film)|The Factory]]'', ''[[The Numbers Station]]'', ''[[The Frozen Ground]]'', ''[[Drive Hard]]'' (2014), ''[[The Prince (2014 film)|The Prince]]'' (2014), ''[[Reclaim (film)|Reclaim]]'' (2014), ''[[Cell (film)|Cell]]'' (2016), ''[[Arsenal (2017 film)|Arsenal]]'' (2017), ''[[Blood Money (2017 film)|Blood Money]]'' (2017) and ''[[Singularity (2017 film)|Singularity]]'' (2017).

==Politics==
Between 2005 and 2009, Cusack wrote blogs for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', which included an interview with [[Naomi Klein]]. He blogged on his opposition to the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] and his hatred for the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], calling its worldview "depressing, corrupt, unlawful, and tragically absurd".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cusack/ ''John Cusack - Politics on The Huffington Post''].&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in a June 2008 [[MoveOn.org]] advertisement, where he made the claim that [[George W. Bush]] and [[John McCain]] have the same governing priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/11/john-cusack-stars-in-move_n_106556.html |title=John Cusack Stars In MoveOn's New McCain Ad |work=Huffington Post |agency=Associated Press |date=June 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cusack criticized the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] for its [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drone]] policy in the Middle East and its support of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]], and became one of the initial supporters of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]] in 2012. In June 2015, he stated in an interview with ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' that "when you talk about drones, the American Empire, the NSA, civil liberties, attacks on journalism and whistleblowers, ([[Barack Obama|Obama]]) is as bad or worse than Bush".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/04/john-cusack-talks-love-mercy-drug-trips-and-how-obama-is-worse-than-bush.html|title=John Cusack Talks ‘Love &amp; Mercy,’ Drug Trips, and the Ways Obama Is ‘Worse Than Bush’|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later scolded the publication for misquoting him in order to make an interesting headline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/johncusack/status/606482448088743936|title=John Cusack on Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/johncusack/status/606485036888686593|title=John Cusack on Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Cusack, [[Daniel Ellsberg]] and [[Arundhati Roy]] met [[Edward Snowden]], a fugitive from the US because of his leaks of classified information, at a [[Moscow]] hotel room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roy |first=Arundhati |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/28/conversation-edward-snowden-arundhati-roy-john-cusack-interview?CMP=share_btn_fb |title=Edward Snowden meets Arundhati Roy and John Cusack: ‘He was small and lithe, like a house cat’ |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 November 2015 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting was converted into a book co-authored with Roy titled ''Things That Can and Cannot Be Said''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/304605/things-that-can-and-cannot-be-said/ |title=Things That Can and Cannot Be Said |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is mainly a transcript of the conversation between Snowden, Roy, and Cusack, with a selection of relevant photos and illustrations as well as a detailed list of references.

In November 2017, Cusack became a member of the [[Democratic Socialists of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=johncusack |number=928473229823500290 |date = 7 November 2017 |title=What you mean join ;) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:John-cusack-in-the-raven.jpg|thumb|right|Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe in ''The Raven'']]
Cusack is a fan of both the [[Chicago Cubs]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]], for which he says he is "in trouble" in Chicago due to the longstanding rivalry between the teams. He led the crowd in a performance of "[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]" at [[Wrigley Field]].  He was in attendance&amp;mdash;along with fellow Cubs fans [[Bill Murray]], [[Eddie Vedder]] and [[Bonnie Hunt]]&amp;mdash;during the Cubs' historic Game Seven victory during the [[2016 World Series]]. Cusack appeared in multiple [[Chicago Bears]] games and attended many [[Stanley Cup Finals]] games in support of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].

Cusack once told ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', "I'm not lazy. I just enjoy gradually waking up in the morning. If that means sleeping in and walking around the house in my crocs and a bathrobe 'til three in the afternoon, I welcome that appealing lifestyle{{mdash}}all day."

He trained in [[kickboxing]] under former world kickboxing champion [[Benny Urquidez]] for over two decades. He began training under Urquidez in preparation for his role in ''Say Anything...'' and holds the rank of a level six black belt in Urquidez's [[Ukidokan Karate|Ukidokan Kickboxing]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bennythejet.com/ukidokan-kickboxing-black-belts.asp Ukidokan Black Belts and Levels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312201202/http://www.bennythejet.com/ukidokan-kickboxing-black-belts.asp |date=2010-03-12 }}. URL accessed on March 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, police arrested Emily Leatherman outside Cusack's [[Malibu, California]] home for [[stalking]] him. On October 10, 2008, Leatherman pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] and received five years' probation and mandatory psychiatric counseling, and was ordered to stay away from Cusack, his home, and business for the next ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/10/10/2008-10-10_accused_john_cusack_stalker_emily_leathe.html  Accused John Cusack stalker, Emily Leatherman, accepts plea deal]. ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]''. October 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is well known for being a [[bachelor]]. When asked in 2009 why he had never married he answered, "society doesn't tell me what to do."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew  Goldman, "[http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a10685/being-john-cusack-386404/ Being John Cusack]", ''Elle'' magazine, November 23, 2009.

'''Kalananda''' is a compound word within the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] mythology consisting of [[Kāla (time)|Kāla]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]].

== Kāla and Nanda ==

Kāla (pronounced with a long final vowel a) is also the name of the Goddess of fine arts, and one-sixteenth of the moon. Kāla is also a [[sanskrit]] word for "time".

Nanda (Sanskrit: नंद) or Nandagopa was, according to the texts of the [[Harivamsha]] and the [[Puranas]], the head of the gopas (a tribe of cowherds referred as Holy Gwals). On the night of [[Krishna]]'s appearance or birth, [[Vasudeva]] (Krishna's father) brought Krishna to Nanda for Krishna's childhood years. Nanda brought up both Krishna and [[Balarama]]. Nanda was married to [[Yasoda]]. Krishna derives his name Nandanandana (meaning son of Nanda) from him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12160">The [[Diocese|diocesan]] system of the [[Catholic]] church government in [[Spain]] consists mainly of a nearly entirely Latin hierarchy of 70 territorial (arch)[[diocese]]s :
* fourteen [[ecclesiastical province]]s, each headed by a [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] [[archbishop]] (one of which, Toledo, uses the [[Mozarabic rite]]), have a total of 55 [[suffragan]] [[Bishop]]s.

Exempt, i.e. directly subject to the [[Holy See]], are :
* the (vacant) Latin [[Titular Patriarchate]] of the West Indies
* the Spanish [[military ordinariate]], which is a Latin [[army bishopric]] (personal diocese for the military) headed by an archbishop
* the bishopric of Gibraltar, also Latin
* the joint [[Ordinariate for the Faithful of Eastern Rite]]  for all [[Eastern Catholics]] in Spain.

All except the Exempt Bishop of Gibraltar of members of the national [[episcopal conference]] of Spain.

There is also an [[apostolic nunciature]] (papal embassy) to Spain (in national capital Madrid), into which is also vested the nunciature to [[Andorra]]. &lt;br&gt;Gibraltar and Ceuta, being British viz. Spanish overseas territories without sovereignty (and disputed by Spain viz. [[Morocco]]), have no papal diplomatic representation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">'''Lodewijk De Koninck''' ([[Hoogstraten]], 30 October 1838 - [[Retie]], 22 March 1924) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] writer.

He studied at the school for teachers [[Lier, Belgium|Lier]] and became a teacher in [[Antwerp]]. Later he became an inspector of the [[Catholic]] primary schools and a teacher at the school for teachers in [[Mechelen]].

As a writer he wrote poems which reflected his strict catholic belief. He is best known for the epic ''Het menschdom verlost'' (first edition 1872) (E: Humanity saved), written in [[Alexandrine]] verse. He also wrote the [[libretto]] of the [[oratorio]] ''Fransciscus'' of [[Edgar Tinel]].

At the frontwall of his house in the ''Sint-Martinusstraat'' (nr. 8) in Retie, there was, in earlier days, a stone with the engraving ''Hier leefde en stierf dichter Lodewijk De Koninck 1924'' (e: Here lived and died the writer Lodewijk De Koninck 1924).

'''Luninets''' ({{lang-be|Лунінец}}, {{lang-ru|Лунине́ц}},&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Rosental, ''Slovar' udarenii dlya rabotnikov radio i televideniya'' (Moscow, 1984), p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-pl|Łuniniec}}, {{lang-lt|Luninecas}}, {{lang-yi|לונינייץ|Luninitz}} [[BGN/PCGN romanization of Belarusian|BGN/PCGN romanization]]: ''Luninyets'') is a town and administrative centre for the Luninets district in [[Brest Province]], [[Belarus]], before which it was in [[Poland]] (1540–1793, 1920–1939) and [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] (1793–1920, 1939–1941, 1944–1991). It has a population of some 24,000, and is immediately east of the [[Pinsk|Pinsk district]] within Brest.  It was home to [[Luninets (air base)|Luninets air base]] during the [[Cold War]].

== History ==
Luninets is said to be mentioned in print sources dating to 1540.  It was part of the [[Pinsk]] region which was under Polish rule between the 16th and 18th centuries but fell to [[Russia]] in 1793 in the [[Partitions of Poland|Second Partition of Poland]]. In 1888, while under Russian sovereignty, a railway junction was built in Luninets, linking it by rail to [[Warsaw]], [[Rivne]], [[Vilna]] and [[Homel]], and a proper railroad station was added in 1905.

Luninets became part of [[Poland]] in 1920 following the [[Polish-Soviet War]], but nineteen years later was incorporated back into the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939, and, with the exception of occupation by [[Nazi Germany]] from 10 July 1941 to 10 July 1944, remained part of the Soviet Union until 1991, at which time sovereignty ceded to the Republic of [[Belarus]].

The Jewish population was important in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/luniniec/5,history/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033337/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/luniniec/5,history/ |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941 to 1943, 4 000 Jews were murdered in mass executions perpetrated by an [[Einsatzgruppe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://moreshet.pl/he/node/1109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.fr/2006/05/mass-graves-in-polesie.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/he/research/ghettos_encyclopedia/ghetto_details.asp?cid=525#!prettyPhoto&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Village devil posts.jpg|thumb|"Village devil posts", ''[[jangseung]]'' as described in ''[[:wikisource:The passing of Korea|The passing of Korea]]'' (1906) by the American Protestant missionary Homer Bezaleel Hulbert.]]
The '''movement to overthrow the worship of gods''' ([[Hangul]]: 미신 타파 운동 ''misin tapa undong''), also described as '''movement to overthrow superstition''', as 미신 ''misin'' is also translated after the movement, was a series of waves of [[demonisation]] and attempted violent uprooting of [[Korean shamanism]] and folk religion that took place in the period between the late 19th century and the 1980s.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|pp=4–7}} In modern [[Korean language]], ''misin'' has the meaning of "illusory" or "false spiritual beliefs", and implies that gods and ancestors do not exist. This term was adopted from [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in the late 19th century, and largely emphasised by [[Christian missionaries]] to target Korean indigenous religion.{{sfnb|Connor|Samuel|2001|pp=28–29}}

Waves of ''misin tapa undong'' started in the 1890s with the rise of influence of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] preachers in [[Korea]],{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|pp=4–7}} and culminated during the [[New Community Movement]] of the 20th century, in [[South Korea]]. These movements destroyed most of the indigenous cults and shrines of folk religion, which were largely replaced by [[Christianity]].{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=10}}

==Waves==
===Late Joseon (1890s)===
{{See also|Joseon}}
[[Protestantism]] sunk deep roots in Korea in the 1890s, establishing a network of schools and hospitals.{{sfnb|Connor|Samuel|2001|p=29}} Protestant missionaries labeled indigenous religious practices and shamans as "devil worship".{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|pp=4–7}} The missionaries led campaigns for the burning of idols, [[ancestral tablet]]s, shamans' tools and clothes, and shrines. According to missionary reports, they were "destroyed as were the books in Ephesus".{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=5}} The missionaries also circulated stories about shamans who had converted to Christianity becoming themselves advocates of the destruction of the indigenous religion.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=5}} The exorcistic struggle between a shaman and a Christian was made into a literary motif with Kim Tongni's colonial-period novella ''Portrait of a Shaman''.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=6}}

Missionaries found allies among Korean intellectuals in the final years of the [[Joseon]] kingdom. Together, they produced ''The Independent'' (''Tongnip Sinmun''), the first newspaper published in [[Korean language]].{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=7}}{{sfnb|Connor|Samuel|2001|p=29}} The newspaper promoted iconoclasm and addressed government officials on the necessity to eradicate the indigenous religion.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=7}}

In 1896, the police began to arrest shamans, destroy shrines and burn ritual tools. These events were acclaimed by ''The Independent''.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=8}} At one point, the newspaper even came to criticise [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist monks]].{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=8}}

===Japanese occupation (1910–1945)===
{{See also|Korea under Japanese rule}}
Campaigns against Korean indigenous religious traditions also accompanied [[Japan]]'s annexation of the Korean peninsula. The Japanese had already equated secularisation with modernity in their own country.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=8}} The colonial police harassed and sometimes arrested shamans, though official policies against Korean shamanism were neither monolithic nor consistent.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=8}}

Following the rhetoric of ''The Independent'' of the foregoing generation, the colonial government portrayed the indigenous religion and the shamans as irrational and wasteful, adding the notion that they were also unhygienic.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=9}} Urban people adopted this rhetoric, seeking to distinguish themselves from their own rural origins.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=9}} Migrants to the cities rejected ''[[gut (ritual)|gut]]'' healing and traditional medicine.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=9}}

This paradigm would have become central to the projects for countryside development enacted in the independent [[South Korea]].{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=10}}

===Yi Seungman's government (1948–1960)===
Under [[Yi Seungman]]'s government, shamans were routinely harassed and arrested by the police.{{sfnb|Connor|Samuel|2001|p=31}} Protestants in [[Jeju Island]] led a "campaign against gods", through which they tried to exterminate Jeju's religious tradition and its pantheon of 18,000 deities.

===New Community Movement (1970s)===
{{See also|New Community Movement}}
In the 1970s, the president [[Park Chung-hee]] started the [[New Community Movement]] (''Saemaul Undong''), a mass mobilisation intended to transform rural society in both form and spirit.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=10}} Local communities were involved in a variety of public works.{{sfnb|Connor|Samuel|2001|p=28}}

Under the banner of such reform, a formal "Movement to Overthrow Superstition" (''Misin Tapa Undong'') was started. With official encouragement, police and local leaders suppressed ''gut'' rites and local cults.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=10}} They poured gasoline on village shrines and torched them, destroyed sacred trees, totem poles, and cairns, raided ''gut'' and arrested shamans.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=10}}{{sfnb|Connor|Samuel|2001|p=28}} Contemporary commenters criticise the movement for having damaged the indigenous religious tradition and having caused much of the South Korean population to adopt the foreign Christian religion.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=10}}

==Legacy==
In the aftermath of the wave of "anti-superstition movements", Korean indigenous religion was severely weakened. Since the 1980s, however, traditional religion and shamanism have experienced a revival in [[South Korea]].{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=10}} Since the 1990s, shamans started to be regarded as "bearers of culture".{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|p=22}} Today, Korean shamanism is recognised as a legitimate "religion" in South Korea, and there is widespread acknowledgement of "Muism" or "Sindo"—how shamanism is called—as the natural religion of the Koreans.{{sfnb|Kendall|2010|pp=29–30}}

In a 1927 letter to Sigmund Freud, [[Romain Rolland]] coined the phrase "'''oceanic feeling'''" to refer to the sensation of being one with the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Roberts |first=Robert |editor=[[Edward N. Zalta|Zalta, Edward N.]] |title=Emotions in the Christian Tradition |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotion-Christian-tradition/ |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |volume=Winter 2016 |date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion.&lt;ref&gt;The Ontology of Religiosity: The Oceanic Feeling and the Value of the Lived Experience&lt;/ref&gt; Freud discusses the feeling in his ''[[The Future of an Illusion|Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927) and ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1929). There he deems it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated himself or herself from other people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', [http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/FreudS-CIVILIZATION-AND-ITS-DISCONTENTS-text-final.pdf pp. 11–13].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a [[Romain Rolland#Correspondence with Freud|letter to Freud]]:

{{quote|''Mais j'aurais aimé à vous voir faire l'analyse du sentiment religieux spontané ou, plus exactement, de la ''sensation'' religieuse qui est...le fait simple et direct de ''la sensation de l'Eternel'' (qui peut très bien n'être pas éternel, mais simplement sans bornes perceptibles, et comme océanique).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |last=Masson |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Oceanic Feeling.

Freud ends ''The Future of an Illusion'' with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of ''Civilization and Its Discontents'', answering Rolland's request. There he credits the concept to an anonymous friend.

== Freud's explanation ==
Freud argues that the "oceanic feeling", if it exists, is the preserved "primitive ego-feeling" from infancy.  The primitive ego-feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it.  Therefore, the infant has no concept of a "self" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist.  Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the "oceanic feeling" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.

== Neuroscientific explanation ==
{{Main article|Neuroscience of religion}}

"Neurotheology" is a [[neologism]] that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Other researchers have rejected the term, preferring to use terms like "spiritual neuroscience" or "neuroscience of religion". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert A. |last=Burton |authorlink=Robert A.

What [[Andrew B.

In other words, the sensation that [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] call ''oneness with the universe''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Newberg, Andrew B. |authorlink=Andrew B.

'''Pahoran''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|h|ɔr|ən}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), "pa-hōr´un"&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Book of Mormon]], was the third chief judge of the Nephites, who inherited the position from his father [[List of Book of Mormon people#N|Nephihah]] in about 67 BC, in the 24th year of the judges  ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=50|verse=39|range=-40}}).

Soon after his appointment, he was opposed by the king-men, who wanted to dethrone the chief judge and replace him with a king. Supporting the chief judge and the current order were the "freemen". The people voted, and the freemen won ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51|verse=2|range=-7}}). The king-men were unwilling to defend their country against the attacks from [[Amalickiah]], which angered [[Captain Moroni|Moroni]]. Moroni requested Pahoran to give him the right to [[conscript]] the king-men or to have them executed for treason. Pahoran approved the request ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51|verse=13|range=-16}}).

Several years later, Moroni writes to Pahoran to request reinforcements but with no success. Moroni complained to Pahoran and questioned his loyalty to his country. Pahoran responded that the capital, [[Zarahemla]], was controlled by the king-men and that he had been exiled. He assures Moroni that he is not a traitor but wants only to preserve the liberty of his people ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=59|verse=3}},{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=60||nobook=}},{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=61||nobook=}}). Moroni and Pahoran gathered an army against [[Pachus]], the leader of the king-men. Pachus was slain, the king-men are executed, and Pahoran was restored to the judgement seat. Moroni and Pahoran work to drive the Lamanites from their land ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=62}}).

Finally, in around 53 BC, in the 39th year of the judgea, Pahoran dies, apparently while still the chief-judge ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Helaman|chapter=1|verse=1|range=-4}}).

==Pahoran, son of Pahoran==
'''Pahoran''' was also the name of the previous Pahoran's son. When the aforementioned Pahoran had died, he left no one to fill in his place in the judgement-seat. Three of Pahoran's sons, by the names of ''Pahoran'', [[Paanchi (Book of Mormon)|Paanchi]], and [[List of Book of Mormon people#P|Pacumeni]], were left to contend for it, but the matter was settled in the 40th year of the reign of the judges, or around 52 BC, by a [[vote]]: Pahoran, the son of Pahoran, won it. Pacumeni, when he saw that he lost, accepted the outcome and supported his brother, but Paanchi, the third brother, would not. He tried to rebel but was executed according to law. His followers were so angry at that that one of them, a man named [[Kishkumen]], went to the judgement-seat and murdered Pahoran. He then escaped the clutches of Pahoran's servants and fled.

Pahoran was succeeded by his brother, [[Pacumeni]].

==King-men==
The '''king-men''' were a group of [[Nephites]] who sought to overthrow Judge Pahoran and install a king to rule the land. Some [[Nephites]] dissented from the current government and believed Chief-Judge Pahoran should change some laws, but Pahoran refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenters, called king-men,&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; then wanted a king to be appointed to govern instead of a chief-judge. However a public vote overruled them,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/manual/book-of-mormon-stories/chapter-33-king-men-versus-freemen?lang=eng&amp;_r=1 ''Book of Mormon Stories'', (1997), Chapter 33: King-Men versus Freemen]&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest of the people called themselves "freemen'' to distinguish their position and their desire to retain their religious freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahoran kept his position and there was no bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Amalickiah]] gathered an army of [[Lamanites]] to attack the Nephites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freemen prepared to battle, but the king-men refused to defend their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Captain Moroni]], the leader of the Nephite armies, was angry from the king-men's stubbornness and petitioned Pahoran for legal authority to compel the king-men to defend their country or be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; By popular consent and the approval of Pahoran, Moroni and his armies quashed the king-men's rebellion, killing about 4000 men;&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:16-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remainder of the king-men yielded to Moroni and took up arms in their country's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=51:20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2070">'''Paul Palnik''' (born 1946) is a [[Jewish]]-[[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[writer]] and [[educator]].

Born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Palnik introduced [[kabbalistic]] spiritual themes into his cartoons from the 1970s to the present day.  His cartoons combine graphic design, drawing, poetry and literature. The images are pen and ink drawings often rendered in [[minute]] detail. The cartoons are like one page books,  each dispensing [[wit]], [[wisdom]] and spiritual advice. Palnik Cartoons can be described as being balanced between universal, spiritual, prophetic themes, and the absurd.


Many of Palnik's original drawings are in the collection of [[The Ohio State University]] libraries in [[Columbus, Ohio]] and his work is also represented in the [[Muse Magazine Cartoon Collection from the publishers of The Smithsonian]] in [[Washington DC]]. Numerous large paintings by Palnik are in the collection of [[Camp Ramah (Wisconsin)|Camp Ramah]] in [[Conover, Wisconsin]], where he was artist in residence for 15 years. His paintings strive to depict humanity's relationship with [[God]]. Palnik lives in Columbus, Ohio.

{{Islam and iman}}
'''People of the Book/Scripture''' ({{lang-ar|أهل الكتاب }} ′Ahl al-Kitāb) is an Islamic term referring to [[Jews]], [[Christians]], and [[Sabians]] and sometimes applied to members of other religions such as [[Zoroastrians]].&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ahl al-Kitab|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-74|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103171035/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-74|archivedate=3 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[Judaism]] to refer to the [[Jewish people]] and by members of some Christian denominations to refer to themselves.
 
The Quran uses the term in reference to Jews, Christians and Sabians in a variety of contexts, from religious polemics to passages emphasizing community of faith between those who possess monotheistic scriptures. The term was later extended to other religious communities that fell under Muslim rule, including even polytheistic Indians. Historically, these communities were subject to the [[dhimma]] contract in an Islamic state.

In [[Judaism]] the term "People of the Book" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: עם הספר, ''Am HaSefer'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kerry M. Olitzky, Ronald H. Isaacs|title=A Glossary of Jewish Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCy77T7kpnkC&amp;pg=PA217|page=217|publisher=Jason Aronson|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; has come to refer to the [[Jewish people]] and the [[Torah]].&lt;ref name="Yahudi"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G2YlLrQUgzsC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;dq=baptists+are+people+of+the+book&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=baptists%20are%20people%20of%20the%20book&amp;f=false|title =People of the Book: Christian Identity and Literary Culture|author=David Lyle Jeffrey|quote=Though first intended pejoratively, "People of the Book" in Jewish tradition came to be accepted with pride as a legitimate reference to a culture and religious identity rooted fundamentally in Torah, the original book of the Law. |publisher=William B.

Members of some [[Christian denominations]], such as the [[Baptists]], [[Methodists]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]],&lt;ref name="adventistworld.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.adventistworld.org/issue.php?issue=2010-1002&amp;page=11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714163613/http://archives.adventistworld.org/issue.php?issue=2010-1002&amp;page=11 |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pobpublications.com/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628145450/http://pobpublications.com/about |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Puritans]] and [[Shakers]], have embraced the term "People of the Book" in reference to themselves.&lt;ref name="Baptist Church"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tuuys4HxSzcC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Baptist+People+of+The+Book+Islam&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title =Three Monotheistic Faiths - Judaism, Christianity, Islam: An Analysis And Brief History|author=Dr. Andrea C.

In fact, the first of these groups are foremost in the Christian tradition who claimed the term in question, proud themselves to be in their own way identified as "a People of the Book". In the early Christian experience the New Testament was added to the whole Jewish "Tanakh" (an acronym from ''T''orah, the Law, Nebi'im, the prophets, and ''K''ethubim, the other canonical writings). This larger anthology, which after St. Jerome's translation tended more and more to be bound up as a single volume, had for those to whom the Christian missionaries came bearing it all the import of a unified ''locus'' of authority: "''the'' Book". |publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Qur'an==

In the Quran the term "people of the book" refers to [[Jews]], [[Christians]], and [[Sabians]].&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Vajda, G | year= 2012 | title=Ahl al-Kitāb |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_0383|subscription=yes|volume=1|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptures referred to in the Quran are the [[Torah]] (''at-tawraat''), the [[Psalms]] (''al-zabur'') and the [[Gospel]] (''al-injiil'').&lt;ref name=EI/&gt;

The Quran emphasizes the community of faith between possessors of monotheistic scriptures, and occasionally pays tribute to the religious and moral virtues of communities that have received earlier revelations, calling on Muhammad to ask them for information.&lt;ref name=EI/&gt; More often, reflecting the refusal of Jews and Christians in Muhammad's environment to accept his message, the Quran stresses their inability to comprehend the message they possess but do not put into practice and to appreciate that Muhammad's teaching fulfills that message.&lt;ref name=EI/&gt; The People of the Book are also referenced in the ''[[jizya]]'' verse (9:29),&lt;ref name=EI/&gt; which has received [[Jizya#In the Qur.27an|varied interpretations]].

==Later Islamic usage==

The use of the term was later extended to [[Zoroastrians]], [[Samaritans]], [[Mandeans]], and even polytheistic Indians.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;&lt;ref name=EI/&gt;

Islamic scholars differ on whether [[Hinduism|Hindus]] are People of the Book.&lt;ref name="hinduism"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sufi Essays | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 1973 | isbn =  0-87395-233-2 | page = 139 | first = Seyyed Hossein | last = Nasr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic conquest of India]] necessitated that the definition be revised, as most India's inhabitants were followers of the [[Indian religions]]. Many of the Muslim clergy of India considered Hindus as people of the book,&lt;ref name="hinduism"/&gt; and from [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] to [[Aurangzeb]], Muslim rulers were willing to consider Hindus as people of the book.&lt;ref name="hinduism2_127"&gt;{{cite book | title = Hinduism and Islam in India: Caste, Religion, and Society from Antiquity to Early Modern Times | first = S. V. | last = Desika Char |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-55876-151-9 | page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Muslims did not treat Hindus as pagans or idol-worshipers,&lt;ref name="hinduism"/&gt; although Hinduism does not include Adam, Eve, nor the various prophets of Abrahamic religions.

[[Buddhism]] does not explicitly recognize a monotheistic God or the concept of prophet-hood. Muslims however had at one point accorded them the status of "people of the Book", and [[Al-Biruni]] wrote of Buddha as the prophet "Burxan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/historical_interaction/pt3/history_cultures_18.html|author=Alexander Berzin|title=The Historical Interaction between the Buddhist and Islamic Cultures before the Mongol Empire|year=2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629190852/http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/unpublished_manuscripts/historical_interaction/pt3/history_cultures_18.html|archivedate=29 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Dhimmi}}

''Dhimmi'' is a historical&lt;ref name=Campo/&gt; term referring to the status accorded to People of the Book living in an [[Islamic state]].&lt;ref name=Campo&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=dhimmi |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |editor=Juan Eduardo Campo |pages=194–195 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |date=2010-05-12 |quote= "Dhimmis are non-Muslims who live within Islamdom and have a regulated and protected status. ...

Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The French scholar Gustave Le Bon (the author of ''La civilisation des Arabes'') writes "that despite the fact that the incidence of taxation fell more heavily on a Muslim than a non-Muslim, the non-Muslim was free to enjoy equally well with every Muslim all the privileges afforded to the citizens of the state. The only privilege that was reserved for the Muslims was the seat of the caliphate, and this, because of certain religious functions attached to it, which could not naturally be discharged y a non-Muslim." Mun'im Sirry (2014), ''Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions'', p.179. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0199359363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abou El Fadl|first1=Khaled|authorlink=Khaled Abou El Fadl|title=The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists|date=2007|publisher=[[HarperOne]]|isbn=978-0061189036|page=204|quote = According to the dhimma status system, non-Muslims must pay a poll tax in return for Muslim protection and the privilege of living in Muslim territory. Per this system, non-Muslims are exempt from military service, but they are excluded from occupying high positions that involve dealing with high state interests, like being the president or prime minister of the country. In Islamic history, non-Muslims did occupy high positions, especially in matters that related to fiscal policies or tax collection.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[sharia]], the dhimmi communities were usually subjected to their own special laws, rather than some of the laws which were applicable only to the Muslim community. For example, the [[Jews|Jewish]] community in Medina was allowed to have its own [[beit din|Halakhic courts]],&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R.

These courts did not cover cases that involved religious groups outside of their own community, or capital offences. Dhimmi communities were also allowed to engage in certain practices that were usually forbidden for the Muslim community, such as the [[Islamic dietary laws|consumption of alcohol and pork]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Misri, ''Reliance of the Traveler'' (edited and translated by [[Nuh Ha Mim Keller]]), p. 608.

Historically, dhimmi status was originally applied to [[Jews]], [[Christian]]s, and [[Sabians]]. This status later also came to be applied to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], [[Hindu]]s, [[Jainism|Jains]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wael B.

Rabbinic tradition has demonstrated a reverence, respect, and love for sacred divinely revealed "text," both written and oral in the process of the chain of transmission (the masorah). Indeed the metaphor of the book is marshaled in Talmudic Tractate Rosh Hashanah, that on Rosh Hashanah the fate of each person for the year is written, on Yom Kippur sealed, and on Hoshanah Rabbah the angels of the heavenly court deliver the verdict to God's archive.

The Hai Gaon in 998 in Pumbeditah comments, "Three possessions should you prize- a field, a friend, and a book." However the Hai Gaon mentions that a book is more reliable than even friends for sacred books span across time, indeed can express external ideas, that transcend time itself.

The Spanish philosopher, physician, and poet Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi writes of the importance of books by commenting, "My pen is my harp and my lyre, my library is my garden and orchard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diyan: ve-hu sefer kolel kol shirei Yehudah ha-Levi.. im hagahot u-ve'urim ve-'im mavo me-et Hayim Brodi|last=Brodi|first=Hayim|publisher=bi-derus Tsevi Hirsch b.R. Yitshak Ittskovski|year=1896–1930|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=166, line 37–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provencal scholar Rabbi Yehudah ibn Tibbon (Adler recension) further elaborates on the importance of his library by commenting, "Make books your companions; let your bookshelves be your gardens: bask in their beauty, gather their fruit, pluck their roses, take their spices and myrrh. And when your soul be wary, change form one garden to garden, and from one prospect to prospect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ermahnungsschreiben  des  Jehudah  ibn  Tibbon|last=Steinschneider|first=Moritz|publisher=Berlin|year=1852|isbn=|location=|pages=6–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish statesman Rabbi Shmuel ha-Nagid writes, "the wise of heart will abandon ease and pleasures for in his library he will find treasures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hebrew Ethical Wills|last=Abraham|first=Israel|publisher=JPS|year=1926|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Abraham ibn Daud writes in his sefer ha-qabbala about rabbi Shmuel ha-Nagid that he had sofrim who copied Mishnah and Talmudim, and he used to donated these commissioned core texts to students who could not afford to purchase them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meḳorot le-toldot ha-ḥinukh be-Yiśraʼel|last=Assaf|first=Simcha|publisher=Tel-Aviv, Dvir|year=1930–1954|isbn=|location=|pages=vol 4, p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Yitzchak ben Yosef of Corbeil (ca 1280, France) in his Sefer Mitzvot Qatan composed in 1276 outlines a detailed strategy for the dissemination of his texts by asserting that every community should finance a copy of his halkhic code  and keep it for public consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Be-ohole Yaʻaḳov : peraḳim me-ḥaye ha-tarbut shel ha-Yehudim bi-yeme ha-benayim|last=Asaf|first=Simcha|publisher=Yerushalayim : Mosad ha-Rav Ḳuḳ|year=1943|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Shimon ben Zemach Duran (Tashbaz) in his introduction to his halakhic code, Zohar HaRakiah, writes, "When the wise man lies down with his fathers he leaves behind him a treasured and organized blessing: books that enlighten like the brilliance of the firmament (Daniel 12:3) and that extend peace like an eternal flowing river (ISa 66:12)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/3982|title=Hebrewbooks.org Sefer Zohar Ha-Rakiah|last=Duran|first=Shimon|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604085431/http://hebrewbooks.org/3982|archivedate=4 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The love and reverence for Jewish books is seen in Jewish law. It is not permissible for a sacred Jewish text to lie on the ground and if by accident a book is dropped to the floor  it should be picked up and given a kiss. A Jewish book is not to be left open unless it is being read, nor is it to be held upside down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shulchan Arukh:Yoreah Deah 277|last=Karo|first=Yosef|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not permitted to place a book of lesser sanctity on top of a book of higher holiness, so for example one must never place any book on top of the Tanakh. If one says to someone, "Please hand me this book," the book should be given with the right hand and not with the left hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Babylonian Talmud: Maseket Sofrim 83|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two men are walking and one who is carrying a sacred books should be given the courtesy of entering and leaving the room first, as the second is enjoined to pursue knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Likutei Mahril  118|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi David ibn Zimra of the 16th century  comments that "if one buys a new book he should recite the benediction of the She-Heheyanu."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life and Times of Rabbi David ibn Zimra|last=Goldman|first=Israel|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York : Jewish Theological Seminary of America|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian usage==
In the [[early Christian]] experience the [[New Testament]] was added to the whole [[Old Testament]], which after [[Jerome]]'s translation tended more and more to be bound up as a [[Bible|single volume]], and was accepted as a unified ''locus'' of authority: "''the'' Book", as some contemporary authors refer to it.&lt;ref name="Denominations"/&gt; Many [[Christian missionaries]] in Africa, Asia and in the [[New World]], developed writing systems for indigenous people and then provided them with a written [[Bible translations|translation of the Bible]].&lt;ref name="Perry-Chase-Jacob-Jacob"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=Marvin |last2=Chase |first2=Myrna |last3=Jacob |first3=Margaret |last4=Jacob |first4=James |last5=Daly |first5=Jonathan W. |last6=Von Laue |first6=Theodore H. |year=2014 |title=Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jy5BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA635&amp;lpg=PA635 |volume=Volume II: Since 1600 |edition=11th |location=Boston, MA |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |page=635 |isbn=978-1-305-09142-9 |lccn=2014943347 |oclc=898154349 |quote=In the nineteenth century, in contrast to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Europeans, except for missionaries, rarely adopted the customs or learned the languages of local people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30824">The '''Bishop of Ostia''' is the head of the [[suburbicarian diocese]] of [[Ostia Antica (district)|Ostia]], one of the seven [[suburbicarian sees]] of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]]. The position is now attached to the post of [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], as it has been since 1150,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/guide-iv.htm The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Guide to documents and events (76-2005)] This statement of Miranda is unsourced. Moreover, Rudolf Hüls (pp.79-80) has demonstrated that the perpetual leadership of the Bishop of Ostia is not the case, but that the principle of seniority held true in Rome as it did elsewhere (cf. Hüls, pp. 77-78), before and after Pope Eugenius III.  It was not until Pope Paul IV that the Deanship and the Bishopric of Ostia were tied together, in his Bull of 22 August 1555, ''Cum venerabiles''. {{cite book|title=Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurensis editio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2V7-MMnXzSoC|volume=Tomus sextus (6)|year=1860|publisher=Seb. Franco|language=Latin|pages=502–504}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the actual governance of the diocese entrusted to the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar General of Rome]].

Ostia and Velletri,  "Ostia e Velletri" in Italian, was a single suburbicarian diocese from 1105 to 1914.  In 1914, [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Velletri-Segni|Velletri]] (now Velletri-Segni) was split off as a separate suburbicarian diocese. Starting then, a new Dean would add the see of Ostia to the suburbicarian see he already had.

{{Conversion}}

In the [[sociology of religion]], '''secondary conversion''' is the [[religious conversion]] of an individual that results from a relationship with another convert, rather than from any particular aspect of the new religion. For example, someone might join a religious group primarily because their spouse or partner has done so; such a person would be a secondary convert. Secondary converts are people who join a religion only because of a relationship with the other convert.

Secondary conversion can greatly expand a movement's influence,&lt;ref&gt;

The two terms used to have legally different meanings, but are today [[synonyms]]. ''Setsumatsusha'' can lie either {{nihongo|inside|境内摂末社|keidai setsumatsusha}} or {{nihongo|outside|境外摂末社|keigai setsumassha}} the main shrine's premises. ''Setsumatsusha'' are usually 1x1 ''[[Ken (architecture)|ken]]'' in size. They can however be as small as [[beehives]] or relatively large and have 1x2, 1x3 or even, in one case, 1x7 bays.&lt;ref name="jami"&gt;{{cite web|title=JAANUS|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/m/misedanazukuri.htm|website=aisf.or.jp|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The practice of building ''sessha'' and ''massha'' shrines within a ''jinja'' predates [[recorded history|written history]]. The earliest ''setsumatsusha'' usually had some strong connection to the history of the area or the family of the enshrined ''kami''.

During the [[Heian period]], [[Ise Shrine]] used to make a distinction between the two types based on whether a shrine belonged to the [[Engishiki]] ''Jinmyōchō'' list (''sessha'') or to the ''Enryaku gishikichō'' list (''massha'').&lt;ref name="Eos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=266|title=Sessha, Massha|last=Mori |first=Mizue|publisher=Encyclopedia of Shinto|accessdate=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

From the [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|Japanese Middle Ages]] onwards, at other shrines popular ''kami'' like [[Hachiman]], [[Inari (mythology)|Inari]] or {{nihongo|Gozu Tennō|牛頭天王}} were often enshrined&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Through a process called ''[[kanjō]]''&lt;/ref&gt; in ''setsumatsusha'', but no clear distinction between the two terms was made. From the [[Meiji period]] to the [[Second World War]], a shrine dedicated to family members of a ''kami'', to the {{nihongo|violent side of a kami|荒魂|aramitama}}, or the ''kami'' of the region where the main shrine was, were to be considered ''sessha'' with a higher rank than the rest, which were called ''massha''.&lt;ref name="Eos"/&gt; When the {{nihongo|''[[Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines|shakaku]]''|社格}} shrine ranking system was abolished in 1946, legally the distinction disappeared, but both terms remained in use out of habit.

==Architectural style==
[[File:Sanko-jinja massha.jpeg|thumb|A ''massha'' at [[Sankō Shrine]] in [[Ōsaka]]]]

Being true shrines, ''setsumatsusha'' have most features other types of shrines have, including doors and often stairs. However, the {{nihongo|''Misedana-zukuri''|見世棚造 or 店棚造|showcase style}} is a style normally used only in ''sessha'' and ''massha''. It owes its name to the fact that, unlike other shrine styles, it doesn't feature a stairway at its entrance, and the veranda is completely flat.&lt;ref name="jami"/&gt; Miniature stairways can however be present. They can be either {{nihongo|''[[tsumairi]]''|妻入}}, that is have the entrance under the gable, or, more frequently, {{nihongo|''[[hirairi]]''|平入}}, that is, have the entrance on the side parallel to the roof's ridge (see examples in the gallery). Apart from the lack of a staircase, such shrines belong to the ''[[nagare-zukuri]]'' or ''[[kasuga-zukuri]]'' styles.

==Sphatikam ==
Sphatikam is a semi-precious [[gemstone]]. There are many different varieties of sphatikam. High quality quartz crystals are single-crystal silica with optical or electronic properties that make them suitable for [[hardstone carving]]s. The Hindu temples in South India use this semi-precious mineral for making Shiva Lingams. Sphatikam beads are made from translucent rose quartz are cut and polished as beads. Each bead is about ten millimeters in diameter. It is good conductor of heat. Hence people wear sphatikam jewelry (mala) to keep their body cool. Some other people claim that these beads have healing properties.

==Sphatika Lingam in scriptures==
In Hindu Shiva temples, Saiva [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]]([[Shaivism|Shaivism's]] [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]]) allows worshiping [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] in the form of Sphatika Lingam or Crystal Lingam. The Saiva [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] says "one can worship this Great [[Shiva|God Shiva]] in the form of a Lingam made of mud or sand, of cow dung or wood, of bronze or black granite stone. But the purest and most sought-after form is the [[quartz]] crystal (Sphatika), a natural stone not carved by man but made by nature, gathered molecule by molecule over hundreds, thousands or millions of years, grown as a living body grows, but infinitely more slowly. Such a creation of nature is itself a miracle worthy of worship."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/blog/taka/2017/01/07/a-clear-crystal-vision-the-story-of-iraivans-lingam/|title=A Clear Crystal Vision: The Story of Iraivan’s Lingam|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sphatika Lingam in Temples==
Sphatika Lingam is representing the icon of Lord Nataraja. The Sphatika Lingams are protected in the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Shiva. Hindu priests offer milk, water, or [[vibhuti]] [[abhisheka]] to the Sphatika Lingam. They also chant 108 times [[Om Namah Shivaya|Shiva Panchakshari Mantra]] . It is believed that Sphatika Lingam removes all curses and negative karma and will enhance ones confidence and power.

===Thillai Natarajah Temple, Chidambaram===
[[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Thillai Natarajah Temple, Chidambaram]] is considered as one of the most ancient and most celebrated of Shiva temples in India. [[File:Chidambaram Nataraja temple tank.JPG|thumb|right|Chidambaram Temple]]Saivites attach great religious as well as historic and cultural significance with this temple. In this temple Lord Shiva is an embodiment of the infinite space. Chidambaram temple is associated with Lord Nataraja, or Shiva in his Ananda Tandava pose (the Cosmic Dance of bliss) in the cosmic golden hall (Ponnambalam) and the hall of consciousness (Chit Sabha).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/temples/thillai-nataraja-kovil.html|title=Thillai Nataraja Kovil|publisher= Tamilnadu.com|date=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Shiva is also worshipped in this temple as "formless form" and this fact is being understood as Chidambara Rahasyam. This temple is known for its Akasa Lingam, an embodiment of Shiva as the formless Space.The Hindu monk Adi Sankara is said to have presented a Sphatika Lingam which is still under worship in this temple. This Sphatika Lingam, instituted at Chitsabha, is being represented as Lord Chandramauleeswara (A form of Lord Shiva). Also in the Chitsabha are images of Ratnasabhapati (Nataraja of Ruby), Swarnakarshana Bhairavar, Mukhalingam etc.

===Kadavul Temple, Kauai, Hawaii, USA===
[[Kadavul Temple|Kadavul HinduTemple]] is a traditional Sri Lankan style temple dedicated to [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]  and was established in 1973 in [[Kauai]], [[Hawaii]], USA. [[File:Kadavul Temple Outside.jpg|thumb|Kadavul temple outside|213x213px]]

[[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] is enshrined in the main sanctum in the form of [[Nataraja]] and a crystal [[Lingam|Sivalingam]]. In front of Shiva's sanctum is a 300-Kg, 3-foot-tall, naturally formed sphatika [[Lingam|Sivalingam]] , believed to be the ''largest six-sided, single-pointed crystal ever found.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.himalayanacademy.com/monastery/temples/iraivan/in-the-news|title=Iraivan Temple In the News|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Kadavul temple inside.jpg|thumb|Inside kadavul temple, walls lined with 108 Idols of [[Nataraja]]|left]]

There is a black 16 Ton [[Nandi (bull)]] carved from a single stone in front of pavilion standing on redwood timber pavilion. Six-foot-tall black granite [[Murti]] of [[Ganesha|Lord Ganesha]] and [[Kartikeya|Lord Kartikeya]] are installed in two side shrines. Moreover lining the main walls of the temple is a rare collection of Shiva's 108 [[tandava]] dance poses in 16-inch-tall bronze icons covered with gold leaf. The shrine for the temple's founder, [[Sivaya Subramuniyaswami|Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]] was established to the right of the entry door.

== Early years ==
Sung was born in [[Xiaogang District|Xiaogang village]], [[Kaohsiung County]] in the [[Taiwan Province]] on 17 September 1948. He is the oldest of six children; four sisters and one brother. His father was very adept at making money and worked at a wholesale fish market. His family were the first in their village to own a television and telephone.

His eldest younger sister Sung Pao-lien (宋寶蓮) recalls Sung had developed [[mysophobia]] at the age of three and would eat in the corner and wash his own bowl and chopsticks. Their father had high expectations of Sung but Sung didn't like to study so their father would get angry and beat Sung with a wooden stick but Sung was very gentle, a boy of few words and didn't get upset nor talked back. Sung recalls it was at the age of seven that he saw a beam of light follow him. When he told his classmate, they'd laugh at him. When he told his father, his father said he is crazy. Sung became a social outcast due to poor grades and being abnormal.

After highschool, Sung left home and studied at [[Tung Fang Design Institute]], from that moment, he tried to seek answers and started to read [[Plato]] but couldn't comprehend it, then he read [[Socrates]] and [[Aristotle]] but still couldn't find an explanation for the beam of light he saw as a child.

After finishing [[conscription in Taiwan|military conscription service]], Sung's father gave him NT$1 million to start a shipping business at Taichung harbor. Sung worked there for nine and a half years. His sister, Pao-lien, said she always worried about Sung because he was too kind and not cut out for business so she was taken by surprise when he became a religious master.

=== Prison and change of career ===
Sung went into hiding for two years after writing a bad check and was later imprisoned for two years.

During Sung's time in jail he saw that beam of light outside the windows and says when he was being released from jail at the age of 39 he saw the three Chinese characters Sung Chi-li (宋七力) written in the skies and changed his name to it. It was during this time that Sung says he possessed the ''fenshen'' ability. In 1987 when [[martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was lifted in Taiwan, Sung, who was 39 at the time and out of prison, saw an opportunity and began to hang around [[tea house]]s, talking and demonstrating his skills. As word spread about his abilities, he was noticed by someone who then spent large amounts of money to support Sung and helped him take photos. In 1990, Sung founded the Academy of the Union of Humans and Nature and began recruiting members in Taipei.&lt;ref name="NTU" /&gt; A year later he founded the Sung Chi-li Miracle Association ({{zh|c=中國宋七力顯相協會|p=Zhōngguó Sòng Qīlì xiǎnxiāng xiéhuì}}) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/96/1025/feat7.html|title=Passage|work=Asia Week|date=1996-10-25|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and members believed Sung was greater than [[Buddha]] in his past life.&lt;ref name="NTU" /&gt; In the nine years leading up to 1996, Sung had amassed followers and supporters numbering in the tens of thousands in nine years, including financiers and politicians. At his prime, Sung would draw large numbers of followers who came and went in groups of cars. Sung would tip them tens of thousands of NTD. He recalls giving one elderly flower seller NT$50,000. He said when he was on the run for bouncing a check, his friend refused to lend him NT$500 and he vowed he would not to become a miser himself. The first time a Next Digital reporter, 賀照縈 (He Chao-ying), did an interview, Sung handed the interviewer an envelop containing NT$10,000 cash, telling him it was a gesture of good will that the reporter's boss need not know, to which the interviewer declined to accept the gift. At the last interview, Sung tried to give the interview and his three colleagues an iPhone 6 which they also declined. The interviewer noted Sung seemed desolate so he consoled Sung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nextmag.com.tw/realtimenews/news/13183327|title=《後來怎麼了》彷彿若有光 1996年宋七力事件|work= Next Media Publishing Limited, Taiwan Branch|last=賀 (Ho)|first=照縈 (Chao-ying)|date=2015-01-16|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
=== Scandal ===
The scandal, known locally in Taiwan as the '''Sung Chi-li Incident''' ({{zh|c=宋七力事件|p=Sòng Qīlì shìjiàn}}), was first uncovered by [[Chu Mei-feng|Melody Chu Mei-fong]], then Taipei city councillor who accused Sung of conning disciples by selling them high-priced photos of him demonstrating his supernatural powers and that by worshiping the pictures, his followers could become a [[buddhahood|buddha]].&lt;ref name="ChinaPost2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2002/12/11/33053/Kaohsiung-mayor.htm|title=Kaohsiung mayor believes in fraudulent cult leader|work=The China Post|date=2002-12-11|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also accused [[Frank Hsieh]], who was legal consultant of Sung, of taking NT$16 million in political donations from Sung and that Hsieh's wife helped with compiling and publishing books for Sung. Sung and 16 defendants were then sued by former followers and he was indicted on charges of deception for obtaining NT$3 billion in donations &lt;ref name="UCAN1996" /&gt; by claiming to have supernatural powers by which he could help people.&lt;ref name="TaipeiTimes2004" /&gt; Sung was arrested on 13 October 1996 &lt;ref name="UCAN1996"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/1996/11/20/government-religious-leaders-address-rampant-swindling-by-cults&amp;post_id=8508|title=Government, religious leaders address rampant swindling by cults|work=The Union of Catholic Asian News (UCAN)|date=1996-11-20|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a string of religious cult scandals making news headlines such as Sung Chi-li swindling NT$3 billion and Master Miao Tien swindling NT$2 billion, the [[Executive Yuan]] organized for the first time a forum to discuss the role and regulation of religion in Taiwan. The forum was held in Taipei on 8 November 1996 and attended by 110 senior government officials, religious leaders and scholars from 12 religious communities. The forum blamed  the public's ignorance that allowed cult swindling to thrive.&lt;ref name="UCAN1996" /&gt;

On 23 October 1997, Sung and two assistants Chen Cheng-tung (鄭振冬) and Lo Cheng-hung (羅正弘) were convicted of fraud. Sung and Chen were sentenced to seven years, while Lo was sentenced to two years prison. Frank Hsieh's wife and 13 others were acquitted of deception.&lt;ref name="TaipeiTimes2002" /&gt; During police investigations, Sung insisted he had supernatural powers and could make anyone do as he willed. Police challenged him by inviting him to demonstrate his powers in public but Sung failed to make a standing police offer to sit down. Sung's divine photos were proven to be doctored using basic computer graphic skills.

The case gained public notoriety when [[Frank Hsieh]], who was a lawyer and legal consultant to Sung at the time, and his wife Yu Fang-chih (游芳枝), were reportd to be long time followers of Sung. Yu went so far as to profess personally witnessing Sung's spirit leave his body at will. In 2005, Sung told [[TVBS]] cable news that in 2004 at a gathering in a follower's home, he had taken Hsieh on an [[astral projection|outer body]] tour of Paris with a stopover at the Eifel Tower where they could touch the cast iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Guru-I-Took-Premier-On-Supernatural-Tour-2703135.php?forceWeb=1|title=Guru: I Took Premier On Supernatural Tour|work=SFGate|date=2005-01-27|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hsieh temporarily disappeared from the political scene after it was alleged he had taken inappropriate political donations from Sung and faced fierce criticism from the public over his membership in Sung's cult &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/01/07/2003343727|title=NewsMaker: Election defeat proves no obstacle for Hsieh|work=Taipei Times|date=2007-01-07|last=Wang|first=Flora|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sung admitted to police in charge of the investigation that he lied about having supernatural powers &lt;ref name="ChinaPost2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsletter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UArcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22sung+chi-li%22&amp;dq=%22sung+chi-li%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAwc7Z_eLTAhVGE7wKHc3bBv4Q6AEIRTAH|title=The Cult Observer, Volumes 11-13|page=227|publisher=American Family Foundation|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and police demolished the Miracle Association Memorial Hall, his Transmogrification Society's main shrine, on the grounds that it was built illegally. The shine contained faked photos of Sung in various states of ''fenshen'' which were used by his associates to fool followers into believing Sung's divinity. Sung also made donations to [[Political parties in Taiwan|political parties]].&lt;ref name="Sinorama1996" /&gt;

In 1998, Sung founded a new religion, the Great Sun Sect whose members are believed to be in the hundreds but an accurate number has not been determined ({{zh|c=大日宗|p=Dà rì zōng}}) &lt;ref name="NTU"&gt;{{cite work|url=http://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/hyc/essay/9ROS/P301-338Religion_Occultism-8(Religious_attitudes).pdf|title=Religious Attitudes and Beliefs of Members of New Religions in Taiwan|work=Institute of Sociology, Academia Sinica &amp; Department of Sociology, National Taiwan University|last=Chi|first=Hei-yuan|pages=336-337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Court appeal ===
Although the scandal had almost hurt Hsieh's political career, he surprised everyone by winning the 1998 [[Kaohsiung City]] mayoral election despite being ridiculed and criticized for his link to Sung. The high court trial was reopened a few days after Hsieh's election victory.&lt;ref name="ChinaPost2002" /&gt;

On 28 January 2003, the High Court overturned Sung's fraud conviction citing that the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|constitution]] protected Sung's practices under the freedom of religion which banned the law from defining and intervening in people's beliefs. This despite prosecutors pointing out Sung had admitted to lying about his mystic powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/detail.asp?ID=34527&amp;GRP=B|title='Mystic' acquitted by High Court|work=The China Post|date=2003-01-23|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the protection of freedom of religion, the High Court decided that faith was more important than authenticity and that not only would it be difficult to prove Sung did not have supernatural abilities but that also accusers' testimonies were not sufficient to prove that Sung had defrauded them of money. Frank Hsieh was quoted as saying ""Religion cannot be analysed by reason." &lt;ref name="TheAustralian2008" /&gt;

In 2004, with the financial support of his followers in Australia, Sung opened a US$3 million "divine photo shop" to display his divine photos.&lt;ref name="TheAustralian2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TaipeiTimes2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/09/29/2003204824|title=Controversial guru opens `photo shop' in Kaohsiung|work=Taipei Times|last=Chuang|first=Jimmy|date=2004-09-29|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Next Media]] in 2008, Sung says he is a [[mysophobia|mysophobe]] and has never had any sexual relations.

In 2015, [[SET News]] interviewed Sung regarding his supernatural powers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TYVejdfg20|title=數萬信徒風靡一時　宋七力分身術大解碼 (Deciphering Sung Chi-li's fenshen secrets which captivated tens of thousands of followers)|work=三立新聞台 (SET News Channel)|date=2015-07-13|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reporter asked Sung if he could demonstrate his powers especially his ''fenshen'' ability. Sung objected and insisted that only followers who have awakened their [[third eye]] could see the supernatural. He also demonstrated his abilities of being able to control his followers' bodies with his mind, to which his followers played along, but it had no effect on the reporter and cameraman. [[Next Digital]] also followed up and Sung admitted he is a controversial figure but that he was not afraid of punishment because he has no family and no children to worry about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odoin21rurI|title=你以為宋七力消失了？不，其實他還在 (Did you think Sung Chi-li had disappeared?

&lt;!--
Between 1996 and 2008, he was involved in a series of court cases, which ended with his acquittal.

Ritsuo Yanagita, Japanese authorized expert, testified to Sung Chi-li's photographs of true-form realities which have been found to be not synthesized, and also obtained the court certification from the Government of Japan in March 2010 {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

"'''Take Me to Church'''" is a song by [[Irish people|Irish]] musician [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]] from his debut [[extended play]] (EP) ''Take Me to Church'' (2013) –– originally released as a free download in September 2013, featuring original recordings &amp; mixes of songs "Take Me To Church", "Like Real People Do", "Angel Of Small Death And The Codeine Scene" and "Cherry Wine" –– as well as his later [[Hozier (album)|self-titled debut album]] (2014). The song was released as his debut single 13 September 2013. Hozier, a struggling musician at the time of its writing, wrote and recorded the song in the attic of his parents' home in [[Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland]]. A mid-tempo [[Soul music|soul]] song, its lyrics detail Hozier's frustration with the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|its stance on homosexuality]]. The song first caught the attention of independent label [[Rubyworks Records|Rubyworks]], where producer [[Rob Kirwan]] overdubbed the original demo with live instruments. Only two musicians feature on the track: Andrew Hozier-Byrne ([[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]]) and drummer Fiachra Kinder.{{Citation needed|reason=album liner notes disagree|date=February 2017}}

The song's [[music video]] has contributed to its widespread popularity. The clip, directed by [[Brendan Canty]] and Conal Thomson of small production company Feel Good Lost, follows the relationship between two men and the subsequent violent homophobic backlash. Upon its [[YouTube]] release in September 2013, the video quickly began to go [[Viral video|viral]], leading to Hozier's subsequent license with [[Columbia Records]] US and [[Island Records]] UK.

In 2014, the song achieved widespread global popularity, topping the charts in 12 countries and reaching the top 10 in 21 other territories. Aided by music platforms [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]] and [[Spotify]] to become a rock radio hit in the US, the song spent 23 consecutive weeks at the top of the [[List of number-one Billboard Rock Songs|Hot Rock Songs]] chart, tied with [[Imagine Dragons]]{{'}} "[[Radioactive (Imagine Dragons song)|Radioactive]]" as the longest-running #1 in its chart-history (at the time), later crossing over to the all-genre [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it peaked at #2 in December 2014. The song was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]]. The song has been certified [[RIAA certification|five times platinum]] in the US.

On 16 April 2016, Hozier released the original ''Take Me Church EP'' on special edition 12-inch vinyl picture disc for [[Record Store Day]] UK; this was the first time the EP was available as a physical release.

==Background==
In 2013, Hozier was a struggling musician, often seen in [[Dublin]]-area open mic nights. During this period, he penned "Take Me to Church" at his parents' home in [[Bray, County Wicklow]], Ireland, and recorded a rough demo in their attic with a programmed backing track.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite journal| author=Andy Greene| date =January 29, 2015| title =Behind Hozier's Unlikely Rise| journal =[[Rolling Stone]] | location =New York City | issn =0035-791X | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/behind-hoziers-unlikely-rise-20150129| accessdate =February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the song after a bad breakup.&lt;ref name=observer&gt;{{cite journal| author= Rob LeDonne| date =October 10, 2014| title =For Hozier and 'Take Me To Church,' a Four-Year Overnight Success Story| journal =[[The New York Observer]] | issn = 1052-2948 | url =http://observer.com/2014/10/for-hozier-and-take-me-to-church-a-four-year-overnight-success-story/| accessdate =February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The vocals were recorded in my attic at 2 o'clock in the morning. So it's a real homemade job", he later remarked.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite journal| author= Andrew R. Chow| date =November 21, 2014| title =Protesting Injustice, Accepting Fame| journal =[[The New York Times]] | issn = 1052-2948 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/arts/music/hozier-on-protest-pop.html?_r=0| accessdate =February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It caught the attention of independent label [[Rubyworks Records|Rubyworks]], who paired him with producer Rob Kirwan. The song was overdubbed with live instrumentation, but the original demo vocals remained, as Kirwan found them "powerful" enough to remain.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

For the Grammys, Hozier performed the song with [[Annie Lennox]], along with Annie's cover of [[I Put A Spell On You]].

==Lyrical interpretation==

Lyrically, "Take Me to Church" is a metaphor, with the protagonist comparing his lover to religion. The song grew out of Hozier's frustration with the [[Catholic Church]]'s teachings which, although he himself was raised in the Protestant Quaker faith, dominated the social and political outlook of the Irish state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Regan|first1=Brendan|title=RTÉ's new season is a mixed blessing|url=http://www.irishcatholic.ie/article/rt%C3%A9%E2%80%99s-new-season-mixed-blessing|website=The Irish Catholic|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Growing up, I always saw the hypocrisy of the Catholic church", Hozier said in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. "The history speaks for itself and I grew incredibly frustrated and angry. I essentially just put that into my words."&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Irish Times]]'', Hozier stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I found the experience of falling in love or being in love was a death, a death of everything. You kind of watch yourself die in a wonderful way, and you experience for the briefest moment–if you see yourself for a moment through their eyes–everything you believed about yourself gone. In a death-and-rebirth sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/2014/09/20/hozier |title=Hozier: An Interview |work= [[The Irish Times]] |date=20 September 2014 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |author=Mullally, Una}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, he elaborated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sexuality, and sexual orientation – regardless of orientation – is just natural. An act of sex is one of the most human things. But an organization like the church, say, through its doctrine, would undermine humanity by successfully teaching shame about sexual orientation – that it is sinful, or that it offends God. The song is about asserting yourself and reclaiming your humanity through an act of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/03/qa-hozier-on-gay-rights-sex-good-hair.html |title=Q&amp;A: Hozier on Gay Rights, Sexuality, and Good Hair | work= [[NY Magazine]] |date=11 March 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The song draws inspiration from [[atheist]] author [[Christopher Hitchens]] and paraphrases the poet [[Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke|Fulke Greville]]'s verse "Created sick, commanded to be sound".&lt;ref name="hitchens1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/31/hozier-best-vocalists-female-take-me-to-church|title=Hozier: The best vocalists I can think of are female}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hitchens2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yucatanrecords.com/artist-of-the-week/hozier|title=Hozier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hitchens3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11259127/Hozier-interview-Im-a-gangly-introvert.html|title=Hozier Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song rose in prominence alongside its viral music video, attracting A&amp;R representatives from major labels in a bidding war to sign Hozier. He was signed by Justin Eshak of Columbia Records, who later opined that the song became a hit due to a shift on pop radio, spearheaded by [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]: "The music is connecting because when it gets on the air it's such a sharp juxtaposition to the existing material on top 40 radio."&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; The song first experienced chart success in his native Ireland, climbing the charts in October 2013 and eventually reached number 2 on [[Irish Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name=observer/&gt;

In May 2014, Hozier performed the song on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/hozier-wows-us-on-david-letterman-with-rendition-of-take-me-to-church-30274220.html |title=Hozier wows US on David Letterman with rendition of Take Me to Church |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sent to US [[modern rock]] radio on 24 June 2014 by [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref name="Alternative"/&gt; It eventually reached number 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks in December 2014 and January 2015, behind [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[Blank Space]]", while becoming his first top-five single there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6327834/hot-100-taylor-swift-blank-space-meghan-trainor-hozier|title=Taylor Swift's 'Blank Space' No. 1 on Hot 100 for Second Week|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=November 26, 2014 |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2015, the song has sold 4,270,000 copies in the US.&lt;ref name=us_sales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801063634/http://hitsdailydouble.com/news%26id%3D297039 |archivedate=August 1, 2015 |url=http://hitsdailydouble.com/news&amp;id=297039 |title=YTD Marketshare at the Seven-Month Mark |website=[[Hits (magazine)|HITS Daily Double]] |publisher=HITS Digital Ventures |date=July 31, 2015 |accessdate=August 1, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The track has since reached top 5 in many other countries including peaking at number 2 in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

The song initially attracted US attention in [[Nashville]] via an [[adult album alternative]] radio station. From there, it became the top song for the area on music identification application [[Shazam (service)|Shazam]], which led to its appearance on a local top 40 station. "Take Me to Church" achieved widespread popularity in the United States between the summer and fall of 2014.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

Despite the song's popularity on YouTube, the song achieved more listens on [[Spotify]],&lt;ref name="spot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6327661/spotify-seems-to-be-gaining-on-youtubes-streaming | title=Spotify Seems to Be Gaining on YouTube's Streaming Dominance| author = William Gruger | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = November 24, 2014 | accessdate = February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the service's most-streamed song of 2014, achieving 87 million listens.&lt;ref name="spot1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/hoziers-take-me-to-church-is-the-most-streamed-song-of-2014-9915268.html | title=Hozier's 'Take Me To Church' named Spotify's most viral song of 2014| author = Roisin O'Connor | work=[[The Independent]] | date = December 10, 2014 | accessdate = February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The concept for the "Take Me to Church" music video was the result of a collaboration between Hozier, Brendan Canty and his writing partner Emmet O'Brien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/man-behind-hoziers-take-church-6138156 |title=Man behind Hozier's Take Me To Church video hoping to crack the film industry after getting two nominations at the MTV VMAs |work= [[Irish Mirror]] |date=26 July 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015 |author=Ward, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson of Feel Good Lost&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Eoin|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/take-me-to-fame-hoziers-cork-made-video-310955.html|newspaper=Irish Examiner|title=How a €1,500 video made in Cork made Hozier :the biggest name in music}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on 25 September 2013. The video, shot in [[grayscale]] on location at Inniscarra Dam in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]], follows a same-sex relationship in Russia and the violently homophobic backlash that ensues when the community learns of one of the men's sexuality. The video had a budget of 500 Euros.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Lauren (20 July 2014). "Has the Internet Killed the Music Video?" ''Sunday Times'' (London). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The song went viral following its release. "I remember someone texting me to say it was getting 10,000 views an hour", he recalled.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt; The song achieved 230,000 YouTube views within two weeks.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Hozier stated, "The song was always about humanity at its most natural, and how that is undermined ceaselessly by religious organizations and those who would have us believe they act in its interests. What [[LGBT rights in Russia|has been seen growing in Russia]] is no less than nightmarish. I proposed bringing these themes into the story and Brendan liked the idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/hozier-take-me-to-church_n_3991405.html |title=Hozier's 'Take Me To Church' Echoes Russian LGBT Violence |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |date=26 September 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |author=Nichols, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://state.ie/features/video-premiere-hozier-take-me-to-church |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925204947/http://www.state.ie/features/video-premiere-hozier-take-me-to-church |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 September 2013 |title=Video Premiere: Hozier – Take Me To Church |work=[[State (magazine)|State]] |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2014 |author=Udell, Phil }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2588">There are many concepts of '''teachers in Islam'''. Islam does not have an explicit hierarchy, thus the concepts and names for spiritual teachers and secular functions are often mixed and easily confused.  A list of terms used in various Islamic traditions follows:
* The [[Marja'|Marja]] is a label used by the [[Shia]] [[community]], meaning source to follow.
* The most respected of the [[Marjas]] are entitled [[Allamah]]. This [[Persian language|Persian]] name for Teacher is also used by some [[Sunni]]s to denote a teacher of extraordinary respect.
* [[Ulema]]/Ulama is the title that indicates that the teacher has come to awareness of the consensus, the [[ijma]], of the [[Umma]]. Umma is the universal [[community]] of all the followers of God as understood by the [[Muslim]] community (cf. [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], [[Ecclesia (sociology of religion)|Ecclesia]])
* [[Mufti]] is a someone who interprets or expounds Islamic law ([[Sharia]] and [[fiqh]])
* [[Muhaddith]] is someone who has profound knowledge of the [[Haddith]], and teaches by [[Narration]], or [[storytelling]].
* [[Mullah]] is often the title of the teachers at the Madrasahs, Islamic schools. Mullah is a teacher in regard of being respected as a vicar and guardian of Qur'an and the Islamic traditions.
 The [[Shia]] believe that an [[Imam]] can lead mankind in all aspects of life. The Imam is appointed by God. Muhammad informed that the number of Caliphs after him will be 12. The majority of the Muslim world are awaiting the [[12th Imam]]: The [[Mahdi]], either as a first time appearance or as a reappearance after a long occultation. The Mahdi is the greatest teacher, the [[Messiah]] of the Islamic World, Oand the [[Maitreya]] of Buddhism.
* [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|Mawlawi]] is a Persian word for teacher meaning [[Master (form of address)|Master]].
* [[Sheikh]] is sheikh is an Arabic honorific term that literally means [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]]. It is a long historic debate in many cultures whether the elder in itself denotes the role and status of a teacher.
* [[Ayatollah]] is a high ranking title given to Shi'a clerics.
* [[Mujaddid]] is someone is sent by God to aid the Umma and revive Islam at the beginning of every century .
* [[Marabout]] is a spiritual teacher of Islam as it is taught in the West Africa and Maghreb, The word comes from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] concept of [[Saint]]. The "marabout" is known as "[[Sayyed]]" (سيد) to the Arabic speaking Maghribians

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Teancum''' ({{IPAc-en|t|i|ˈ|æ|n|k|ə|m}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «tē-ăn´kum»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] military leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.31?lang=eng#30 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 51:31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described in the [[Book of Alma]] between Alma 50:35 and Alma 62:40 (inclusive). According to LDS teachings, he is known for the assassinations of King [[Amalickiah]] and the subsequent assassination of Amalickiah's brother, [[Ammoron]], seven years later. The Book of Mormon states that in time he proved to be a great chief captain in the Nephite army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/52.19?lang=eng#18 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 52:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appears as a major character in the [[Tennis Shoes Adventure Series]], a series of LDS fiction novels.

== Book of Mormon narrative ==

=== Battle with Morianton ===

The Book of Mormon narrative states that between the years between 71 and 68 BC, there was much peace in the land of the Nephites.&lt;ref name="alma5030"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/50.25?lang=eng#24 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 50:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception was a dispute that began to grow in the land of Lehi and the land of Morianton, which were neighboring lands. The inhabitants of the land of Morianton claimed ownership of a part of the land of Lehi.&lt;ref name="alma5030"/&gt; The dispute grew and eventually led to the inhabitants of Morianton attacking the inhabitants of Lehi, led by a man called [[Morianton]]. The people of Lehi fled from the attack to the camp of [[Captain Moroni]].

Morianton's forces were afraid that Captain Moroni and his army would attack, so they changed their course and attempted to take the land in the North. Captain Moroni caught hold of the plan when one of Morianton's maid servants, whom he had physically abused,&lt;ref name="alma5030"/&gt; escaped from him and allied herself with Captain Moroni. As a preventative measure, Captain Moroni dispatched a contingent of soldiers led by Teancum in order to stop Morianton and his people from fleeing to the North. In the battle which ensued, Teancum killed Morianton and defeated his army, afterward taking prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Card, Orson Scott. {{cite web |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1977/09/dissent-and-treason?lang=eng |title=Dissent and Treason}}. Ensign, Sept. 1977, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; He then made an oath with the prisoners, allowing them to go back to their homes if they would "keep the peace. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/50.35?lang=eng#34 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 50:35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assassination of Amalickiah ===

[[File:Teancum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Assassination of Amalickiah (a modern [[artist's interpretation]]).]]

Later in the narrative, the leader of the [[Lamanite]] army, a military leader called Amalickiah had been taking possession of many Nephite cities which were located on the eastern borders by the seashore. As his army was moving North and capturing Nephite cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.30?lang=eng#29 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 51:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teancum was marching south with his army attempting to take back those cities. The two armies came to a head on the seashore.

The soldiers of Teancum, skilled and well trained in the ways of warfare, quickly gained the upper hand on Amalickiah's armies during the day and drove them back toward the beaches. Amalickiah's army then pitched their tents on the beach and slept for the night. During the night, Teancum and his servant secretly infiltrated the camps of the Lamanites. After a brief search for the tent of the Lamanite king, Tenacum threw a javelin at Amalickiah, which struck him in the heart, killing him instantly. Teancum then successfully fled back to his camp without being detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.34?lang=eng#33 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 51:34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to his camp, the victorious Teancum awakened his armies and caused them to prepare for battle with the Lamanite forces. When the Lamanite army awoke that morning, they found their leader dead, which caused the army to retreat back to the city of Mulek for protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/52.1-2?lang=eng#1 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 52:1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retaking of the city of Mulek ===

Teancum was next sent to attack the city of [[Mulek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/52.16?lang=eng#15 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 52:16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Nephite city located south of [[Bountiful (Book of Mormon)|Bountiful]] that was captured by the Lamanites. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/51.26?lang=eng#25 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 51:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulek had been fortified by Captain Moroni before falling into the hands of Amalickiah and thus was a stronghold for the Lamanite forces. Immediately following the demise of Amalickiah, the Lamanite army that was contending with Teancum's army abandoned their attempt to capture Bountiful and retreated to the city of Mulek.

While Teancum was employed in preparing for war, he received orders from Captain Moroni to attempt a retake of the city of Mulek. However, upon marching with his armies into Mulek, he observed that his army was not prepared to contend with the Lamanites in their fortified city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/52.19?lang=eng#17 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 52:19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Bountiful and awaited the arrival of Captain Moroni and his forces.

When Captain Moroni later arrived with his armies, he called many chief captains of the Nephite forces together for a war council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/52.17?lang=eng#16 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 52:17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strategy was then devised that would cause Teancum to take a small force and march near the city as a decoy while Captain Moroni and his forces would retake Mulek. The operation was successful and the leader of this [[Zoramites|Zoramite]]-Lamanite army was killed. The city of Mulek was again in the possession of the Nephites.

=== Assassination of Ammoron and death ===

The Book of Mormon states that a large battle occurred after the retaking of the city of [[Nephihah]] from the Lamanites. In the narrative, Teancum's forces marched to meet the Lamanites with the armies of Lehi and Captain Moroni. Both sides were greatly fatigued because of the long march. Teancum was angered by Amalickiah and Ammoron for starting the war. He believed if he were to kill Ammoron, the Lamanite army would accept defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Choate, Jane McBride{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/friend/1988/05/scriptural-giants-teancum-fighter-for-freedom?lang=eng |title=Scriptural Giants: Teancum, Fighter for Freedom}} Friend, May 1988, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; He, in striking similarity with his previous encounter with Amalickiah, went out into the night and let himself over the wall using a rope. He crept into Ammoron's tent, threw a javelin at him, and struck him near the heart. The blow, however, was not immediately fatal and Ammoron cried out, awakening his servants. Teancum fled, but the servants of the king chased him and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/62.36?lang=eng#35 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 62:36}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was greatly mourned by Captain Moroni and Lehi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/62.37?lang=eng#36 |title=Book of Mormon, Alma 62:37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Town ==

According to the Book of Mormon, Teancum is also the name of a Nephite town that played an important role during the war in [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]]'s time. The narrative states that the Lamanites drove the Nephites out of Teancum and took possession of it.

'''''The Subsiding of the Waters of the Deluge''''' is an 1829 [[painting]] by English-born American artist [[Thomas Cole]] depicting the aftermath of the [[Great Flood]].

The painting is a 90.8 x 121.4&amp;nbsp;cm [[oil on canvas]]. It is on display at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

==Background==
Cole collected extensive notes on geology and consulted geologists and other scientists such as [[Benjamin Silliman]] to gather background information on what the world might have looked like after the Biblical Flood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Claire|title=The Great American Hall of Wonders: Art, Science, and Invention in the Nineteenth Century|publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-904-832-97-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting shows a barren rocky coastscape as seen from the viewpoint of a cavern. A waterfall created by the receding waters of the Flood flows towards the sea. Debris such as broken trees, a destroyed mast, and even a skull are seen upon the coast. The land has been stripped of soil. The sky outside the cavern is bright and in the distance floats an Ark and a dove flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pastan|first=Amy|title=Young America: Treasures from the Smithsonian American Art Museum|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-0193-8|pages=26|edition=1. publ., 1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The painting is interpreted as representing rebirth and redemption through destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Angela|title=The Empire of the Eye: Landscape Representation and American Cultural Politics, 1825-1875|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-2830-0|edition=1. publ.|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cleansing nature of the Flood is meant to represent America as a "New Eden" free of the abusive power of the European monarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pastan|first=Amy|title=Young America: Treasures from the Smithsonian American Art Museum|year=1999|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-8230-0193-8|pages=26|edition=1. publ., 1. print.|quote=For Thomas Cole, this story of the Biblical flood was a veiled reference to his adopted country, the United States. Washed clean of the corruptions of European monarchy, the new democracy awakens to a promising future.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1829 and 1831 the painting was on exhibit at the [[National Academy of Design]]. It was subsequently lost until 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Angela|title=The Empire of the Eye: Landscape Representation and American Cultural Politics, 1825-1875|year=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-2830-0|edition=1. publ.|page=54|quote=''Subsiding of the Waters'', exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1829 and again in 1831, was lost throughout most of this century, not coming to light until 1974.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The White Eagle Lodge''' is a spiritual organisation first founded in [[England]], founded by Grace and Ivan Cooke in 1936. Grace was a medium who claimed to have received the teachings from a spirit in the higher realms named White Eagle. The Lodge is a present-day school that teaches their beliefs in a manner suited to the modern world. Its work is to help humanity develop its true spiritual nature, and uses the symbol of the six pointed Christ Star to radiate Peace and Healing to those in need.  [[Faith healing|Healing]], both absent and contact, [[meditation]], [[yoga]] and [[astrology]] are taught and practised. The White Eagle Publishing Trust distributes the teachings of White Eagle worldwide in many languages. The Mother Lodge is in England with two continental centers in [[United States|America]] and [[Australia]].

==Healing==

Absent healing is healing by prayer, directed at absent patients. Lone absent healers work from home on their own, and tuning into the Angels of Healing they call on the patients' names and pray for them. Following a set form of service, they envisage colours being gently applied to psychic centres or "[[chakras]]" by healing angels. Thousands of people and animals are on such lists worldwide at any given time. A description of the method used by the Lodge in its healing is found in ''A Healers Journey Into Light''
by Lorna Todd.&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;Lorna Todd [https://books.google.com/books?id=QflBBgV9XlQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=white+eagle+lodge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LUYXpIhRkg&amp;sig=xJP3kh7Mfjq3ptSPVsSs8kp46j4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Of9GSuKEH9KIkQXt1J35CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 ''A Healers Journey Into Light''] London: Bantam (1995) pp. 58-63 {{OCLC|60103219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Members can also work in absent healing groups led by an experienced Healer. There are specific groups working to heal animals.

==Astrology school==
Teaching [[astrology]] has long been an important aspect of the Lodge work. Joan Hodgson (née Cooke) developed a beginners’ correspondence course in 1941, and wrote a series of articles for the early Lodge journal "Angelus." These were published by the White Eagle Publ. Trust as ''Wisdom in the Stars''.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Cooke ''Wisdom in the Stars: the story of the signs of the Zodiac and their effect on the character and destiny of man.'' White Eagle Publ. Trust (1959) {{OCLC|30248320}} {{Primary sources|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then she wrote several other books over several decades, was on the UK Faculty of Astrological Studies at its foundation (a non-Lodge group) and she had many clients. Her daughter, Rose Elliot subsequently also became an astrologer.

In 1976 the Lodge expanded Joan's work into a "School" and she was active until her death in 1995. The school now has Simon Bentley as its Principal, he had worked closely with her for over a decade. Based at the main centre in "New Lands" it holds an annual conference, publishes a journal "Altair", conducts other day events, still runs correspondence courses, and does horoscope readings for clients, in all these using a spiritual focus, not identical with the various forms of "Esoteric" astrology.

==Work in America==
Jean Le Fevre, who had been active in the Crowborough Daughter Lodge (U.K.) moved to the United States and was a key figure in enabling the construction of the Temple of the Golden Rose in Montgomery, Texas, where the organisation is registered as the "Church of the White Eagle Lodge." The Lodge work there is open to liaison with Native spiritual teachings.&lt;ref name="Todd" /&gt;

White Eagle's teaching is set out in around sixty published books, of which a great many are in print. Best known is "The Quiet Mind", first published in 1972. 
For a lavishly illustrated account of seven decades, the most detailed work is ''The White Eagle Lodge story : seventy-five years of work with the light,'' told by friends of White Eagle across the years (Liss, Hampshire, 2008; previous edition, "The Story of the White Eagle Lodge" Liss, Hampshire, 1986).
An account of the White Eagle Lodge in some detail is given by Ingrid Lind in 'The White Eagle Inheritance' (London, Thorsons, 1984) and by Colum Hayward in 'Eyes of the Spirit: working with a Spiritual Teacher' (Liss, Hampshire, 2008)

== Mission and History ==

The mission of UrbanPromise is to equip children and young adults with the skills necessary for academic achievement, life management, personal growth and success. Founded in 1988 by Bruce Main and his wife Pamela in the basement of an unused Baptist church, UrbanPromise began with just one adult staff, 12 college-aged volunteers, and an annual budget of only $12,000.

UrbanPromise began as a spin-off of the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education ([http://www.eape.org EAPE]),&lt;ref name="eape"&gt;http://www.eape.org/ministries.php#urban_promise. Retrieved Jan 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and was directly inspired by EAPE founder [[Tony Campolo|Dr. Tony Campolo]], renowned speaker, author, and sociologist known for his call for Christians to seek justice for the poor and liberation for the oppressed.

Today, the organization has grown to offer myriad youth educational and developmental programming, including an alternative high school, an elementary/middle school, after-school programs, summer camps, teen job training, boat building, environmental and experiential learning, and a host of other enrichment activities.

UrbanPromise challenges Camden youth to develop their academic, social, creative, and leadership potential.   From humble beginnings, the organization now boasts a budget of $3.6 million — primarily generated from individual donors who give $500 to $10,000/year — employs more than 50 full-time staff, and serves 600 local youth and families annually.  UrbanPromise also engages 500 volunteers annually: 50 college interns, 350 work group individuals, and around 100 local residents.&lt;ref name="urbanpromiseusa_b"&gt;http://www.urbanpromiseusa.org/mission. Retrieved Jan 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vision ==

The goal of each UrbanPromise program relates to the development of healthy and positive relationships. Many of the organization's employees and volunteers are UrbanPromise graduates who have returned to Camden to serve their community. Staff work with a group of 50 college-aged interns who commit one to two years to community service in the city of Camden.  These interns work with local teens in UrbanPromise's AfterSchool Programs and Summer Camps; teens are employed as counselors, tutors, and mentors through the organization's StreetLeader program.&lt;ref name="urbanpromiseusa_c"&gt;http://www.urbanpromiseusa.org/mission. Retrieved Jan 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

The majority of children in Camden, New Jersey qualify as "at-risk," which —as defined by the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention — means they are exposed to high levels of risk in their families, homes, communities, and social environments to such a degree that it could lead to educational failure, school dropout, or involvement in juvenile delinquency.&lt;ref name="ojjdp"&gt;http://www.ojjdp.gov/index.html. Retrieved Dec 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Programming at UrbanPromise is scheduled during the time when youth are most at risk of involvement in crime and violence — between 3 and 9 PM.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=VZt5aeL6xTkC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=at+risk+children+3pm+to+9pm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7ZAzcHnLFd&amp;sig=QI9VGSaYsoZ0hSmzeIlL5t7Jig4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ypP1UMyFOJOO0QHJloGYDQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=at%20risk%20children%203pm%20to%209pm&amp;f=false. Retrieved Dec 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a variety of activities, children and teens are encouraged to avoid negative influences and focus on school through mentoring; community service; life skills classes; tutoring; SAT/ACT prep courses; classes in reading, writing, and math; groups focused on social development; and performing and visual arts.&lt;ref name="urbanpromiseusa_d"&gt;http://www.urbanpromiseusa.org/our-programs/afterschool. Retrieved Jan 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

UrbanPromise's two schools — particularly its UrbanPromise Academy high school — serve some of the highest risk youth in the city.  Many come to the organization after dropping out of public school or involvement in the juvenile justice system. Nevertheless, in 2011, UrbanPromise's elementary and middle school saw 98% attendance; and 100% percent of UrbanPromise Academy 2011 and 2012 seniors graduated on time.  Of UrbanPromise's 2012 graduating class, 98% have gone on to pursue post-secondary education. Historically, UrbanPromise graduates have had an 85% college completion rate.&lt;ref name="urbanpromiseusa_e"&gt;http://www.urbanpromiseusa.org/our-programs/academy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urbanpromiseusa_f"&gt;http://www.urbanpromiseusa.org/our-programs/camdenforward. Retrieved Jan 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

UrbanPromise also offers experiential learning activities through its UrbanTrekkers program. Through hands-on learning and outdoor experiences, UrbanTrekkers connects children and teens to the natural world and diverse communities throughout the United States and abroad.&lt;ref name="urbantrekkers"&gt;http://www.urbantrekkers.org. Retrieved Jan 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Replication ==

The UrbanPromise Camden model has inspired replications around the country and across the globe.  UrbanPromise sites within the United States are located in Charlotte, NC, Wilmington, DE, Miami, FL, Trenton, NJ, Little Rock, AR, and Birmingham, AL.&lt;ref&gt;http://urbanpromiseinternational.org/our-ministries/united-states&lt;/ref&gt; These sites minister annually to 457 children and youth in after school programs. There were 827 in attendance among 14 summer camps offered by the various other cities' programs in 2016.

Sites have also been launched and sustained in Canada, Honduras, Malawi, Uganda, the Dominican Republic, and Liberia.  Each location uses its own local resources, donors, and staff to replicate the Camden-based UrbanPromise.&lt;ref name="urbanpromiseinternational"&gt;http://urbanpromiseinternational.org. Retrieved Jan 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2,000 children and youth currently participate in these sites' after school programs, summer camps, feeding programs, and girls' empowerment initiatives. Three private high schools, so far serving approximately 275 students, as well as two homes for orphaned children have been launched in Malawi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8800">'''Zamindawar''' is an [[historical region]] of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] ,it is very large and fertile valley the main sources for irrigation is Helmand River and karizes Helmand borders the road that leads from Kandahar to [[Herat]] via [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah]]. It corresponds to the [[Pakistan]]I region of [[Zhob]]. Zamindawar is located in the greater territory of northern [[Helmand Province|Helmand]] and encompasses the approximate area of modern day [[Baghran District|Baghran]], [[Musa Qala District|Musa Qala]], [[Naw Zad District|Naw Zad]], [[Kajaki District|Kajaki]] and [[Sangin District|Sangin]] districts. It was a district of hills, and of wide, well populated, and fertile valleys watered by important tributaries of the Helmand. The principal town was [[Musa Qala]], which stands on the banks of a river of the same name, about 60 m, north of [[Girishk]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Zamindawar |volume=28 |page=953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This region was headquarters to the [[Durrani]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribe of the [[Alizai tribe|Alizai]]. The region is also home to [[Nurzai]], [[Barakzai]] and [[Alakozai]] tribes, as well as other [[Durrani]] tribes and [[Kuchis]]. It was from Zamindawar that much of the strength of the force which besieged Kandahar under [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Mohammad Ayub Khan]] in 1880 was derived; and it was the Zamindawar contingent of tribesmen who so nearly defeated [[Donald Martin Stewart|Sir Donald Stewart]]'s force at the [[Battle of Ahmed Khel]] previously. The control of Zamindawar was regarded by the [[British Raj|British]]-Indian forces as the key to the position for safeguarding the route between Herat and Kandahar during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Zunbils]] ruled Zamindawar before Islamization of the area. The title Zunbil can be traced back to the [[Middle-Persian]] original Zūn-dātbar, "Zun the Justice-giver".&lt;ref name="Bosworth, Clifford Edmund 2002. p.439"&gt;Bosworth, Clifford Edmund. 2002. ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''. Leiden: Brill. Zamindawar. p.439.&lt;/ref&gt; The geographical name Zamindawar would also reflect this, from Middle-Persian ''Zamin-i dātbar'' (Land of the Justice-giver).&lt;ref name="Bosworth, Clifford Edmund 2002. p.439"/&gt;

==The temple of Zun==

According to author André Wink,
{{quote|In southern and eastern Afghanistan, the regions of Zamindawar (Zamin I Datbar or land of the justice giver, the classical Archosia) and Zabulistan or Zabul (Jabala, [[Kingdom of Kapisa|Kapisha]], Kia pi shi) and Kabul, the Arabs were effectively opposed for more than two centuries, from 643 to 870 AD, by the indigenous rulers the Zunbils and the related [[Shahi|Kabul-Shahs]] of the dynasty which became known as the Buddhist-Shahi. With [[Makran]] and [[Baluchistan]] and much of [[Sindh]] this area can be reckoned to belong to the cultural and political frontier zone of Scythia located between [[India]] and [[Persia]]. It is clear however that in the seventh to the ninth centuries the Zunbils and their kinsmen the Kabulshahs ruled over a predominantly Indian rather than a Persian realm. The Arab geographers, in effect commonly speak of that king of "Al Bakht" ...(who) bore the title of Zunbil.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Hind: Early medieval India and the expansion of Islam, 7th-11th centuries'' By André Wink Edition: illustrated Published by BRILL, 2002 Page 112 to 114 {{ISBN|0-391-04173-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-391-04173-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
South of the [[Hindu Kush|Pamisus]] was ruled by the [[Zunbils]], [[epigoni|offspring]] of the southern-[[Hephthalite]]. The east was controlled by the [[Kabul Shahi]]s. The Zunbil and Kabul Shahis were connected by culture with the neighboring [[Punjab,_Pakistan|Panjab]]. The Zunbil kings worshipped a [[solar deity|sun god]] by the name of ''Zun'' from which they derived their name. For example, André Wink writes that "the cult of Zun was primarily Scythio-Bactrian, not Buddhist or Zoroastrian."&lt;ref&gt;André Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World'', Brill 1990. p 118&lt;/ref&gt;

In 643 AD the non-Muslim Zunbils assembled a large army and attempted to invade [[Persia]], which had just been [[Islamization of Persia|Islamized]], but were defeated by the Muslims. About ten years later, in 653-4 AD, [[Abdur Rahman bin Samara]] along with 6,000 Arab Muslims penetrated the Zunbil territory and made their way to the shrine of ''Zun'' in Zamindawar, which was believed to be located about three miles south of [[Musa Qala]] in today's [[Helmand Province]] of Afghanistan. The General of the Arab army "broke of a hand of the idol and plucked out the [[ruby|rubies]] which were its eyes in order to persuade the Marzbān of Sīstān of the god's worthlessness."&lt;ref&gt;André Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World'', Brill 1990. p 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kabul Shahi ruled north of the Zunbil territory, which included [[Kabulistan]] and [[Gandahara]]. The Arabs reached Kabul with the message of Islam but were not able to rule for long. The Kabul Shahis decided to build a giant wall around the city to prevent more Arab invasions, this wall is still visible today.

[[Willem Vogelsang]] in his 2002 book writes: "During the eighth and ninth centuries AD the eastern parts of modern Afghanistan were still in the hands of non-Muslim rulers. The Muslims tended to regard them as "Afghan", although many of the local rulers were apparently of Hunnic or Turkic descent. Yet, the Muslims were right in so far as the non Muslim population of Eastern Afghanistan was, culturally, strongly linked to the coterminous [[Pakistan]]. Most of them were either [[Zoroastrianism|Bactreo-Zoroastrian]], Animist, or Buddhists."&lt;ref&gt;''Afghanistan: mensen, politiek, economie, cultuur, milieu'' by Willem Vogelsang, Edition: illustrated Published by Wiley-Blackwell, 2002 Page 188&lt;/ref&gt; In 870 AD the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] from [[Zaranj]] conquered most of Afghanistan, establishing Muslim governors throughout the land. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still lived side by side before the arrival of the [[Ghaznavids]] in the 10th century.{{quote|Kábul has a [[castle]] celebrated for its strength, accessible only by one road. In it there are [[Muslim|Musulmáns]], and it has a town, in which are infidels from Scythia.&lt;ref name="Elliot-3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=80201012&amp;ct=100 |title=A.—The Hindu Kings of Kábul (p.3)|work=Sir H. M. Elliot|publisher=[[Packard Humanities Institute]]|location=London|date=1867–1877|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Estakhri|Istahkrí]]|921 AD}}

{{quote|Predominantly [[Persia]]n but possessing [[Central Asian]] features was also the God Zun from which the [[Zunbils]] derived their name.&lt;ref name="Al-Hind page 18"&gt;''Al-Hind, the making of the Indo-Islamic world: Early medieval India and the expansion of Islam 7th to 11th centuries''. Volume 1 by André Wink page 18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Marqart maintained that Zunbil or Zhunbil is the correct form and ''Ratbil'' a corruption, and it was he who connected the title with the God Zun or Zhun whose temple lay in Zamindawar before the arrival of [[Islam]], set on a sacred mountain and still existing in the later ninth century when the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] [[Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari|Yaqub]] and [[Amr Saffari|Amr b Layth]] conquered the area as far as Kabul.&lt;ref name="Al-Hind page 18"/&gt;}}

{{quote|With [[Kabul]] [[Ghazni|Ghazana]] and [[Lashkar Gah|Bust]] as the key points between the commerce between [[India]] and Persia, Zamindawar had become an important pilgrimage center.&lt;ref name="Al-Hind page 18"/&gt;}}

If the Hepthalites were basically Indo- European, politically and culturally the realms of  Zabul and Kabul were considered as a part of Al- Hind on the eve of Muslim conquest. The Chachnama for example contains numerous references to Zabul under the corrupt form of ‘Ramal’ or ‘Ranmal’ showing close contacts and marriage relationships  between the rulers and subordinate chiefs of  Sind and Kashmir  and the King of  Zabul  in the seventh century. The relationships between [https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;vq=Ramal&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q=Ramal&amp;f=true these Indian rulers] on the north- western frontier appear to have been in constant flux but it seems a safe conclusion that the King of Kashmir had established a claim of suzerainty over Zabul -as he had over other Bactrian Kings.&lt;ref&gt;André Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World'', Brill 1990. p 117&lt;/ref&gt;
