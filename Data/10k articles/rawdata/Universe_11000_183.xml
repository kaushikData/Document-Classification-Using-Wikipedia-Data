The '''Professor Abdus Salam Centre for Physics''' ({{lang-ur|عبداسلام ادارہ برائے طبیعیات}}), previously known as the '''Riazzudin National Centre for Physics''' is an academic [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|national research institute]] for physics and mathematical sciences located in [[Islamabad, Pakistan]]. The [[Government of Pakistan]] had the jurisdiction of the institute from 1999 until April 2004, when the institute was made a scientific organization. However, the institute is still funded in large by the Pakistani federal government&lt;ref name="ncp.edu.pk"&gt;http://www.ncp.edu.pk/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. The proposal for the establishment of the centre was first put forward in 1951. It is under the ''de facto'' control of the Strategic Plans Division of the Pakistani [[National Command Authority (Pakistan)|National Command Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoodbhoy |first1=Pervez |title=A Pakistani's candid report after visiting India's IITs |url=https://scroll.in/article/802345/a-pakistani-visitors-report-after-returning-from-india-the-enemy-country |website=Scroll.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in 1999, the institute operates quadripartite supervision of [[ICTP]], [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics|INSC]], and [[CERN]], and main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[high-energy physics]] research. As of today, the NCP emerged as world's leading particle physics institute producing hundreds of papers by world's scientists who joined this institute, and numerous scientific experiments have been constructed at NCP by national and international collaborations to make use of them.

==History==

===Origins===
Establishing world-class physics research institutes was proposed by a number of scientists. The roots of NCP institutes go back to when Nobel laureate professor [[Abdus Salam]], after receiving his doctorate in physics, came back to Pakistan in 1951. Joining his alma mater, [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] as Professor of Mathematics in 1951, Salam made an effort to establish the physics institute but was unable to do so. The same year, he became chairman of the Mathematics [[Academic department|Department]] of the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]] where he tried to revolutionise the department by introducing the course of [[Quantum Mechanics]] necessary for undergraduate students, but it was soon reverted by the vice-chancellor. He soon faced the choice between intellectual death or migration to the stimulating environment of a [[Education in Europe|western institutions]]. This choice, however, left a deep impression on him and was behind his determination to create an institution to which physicists from developing countries would come as a right to interact with their peers from industrially advanced countries without permanently leaving their own countries. This resulted in founding to the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP) by Professor Abdus Salam in Italy.

===INSC and INP===
In 1974, Prof. Abdus Salam visualised the need of an institution where experts from the industrialised nations and learners from the developing countries could get together for a couple of weeks once a year to exchange views on various subjects of current interest in Physics and allied sciences. His suggestion was accepted by Chairman of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] and it was the year 1976 when the first [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs]] (INSC) was inaugurated at Nathiagali, with co-sponsorship of [[ICTP]] and [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], under the directorship of Prof. [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], a pupil student of Abdus Salam. The same year, Ishfaq Ahmad established the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Physics|Institute of Nuclear Physics]] at the [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore|University of Engineering and Technology]] of Lahore where Abdus Salam was invited to give first lectures on particle physics and quantum mechanics.

Since then, it has been regularly held without break and it is a great credit to Prof. Riazuddin for his dedication and commitment as such type of international scientific gathering in a developing country like Pakistan presents a major step for the promotion of science. A major aim and goal, Prof. Abdus Salam had in his mind when he made his original proposal to PAEC in 1974 that Nathiagali Summer College would evolve into a full-fledged Centre for Physics on the pattern of ICTP. To transform his vision to reality, his student Prof. Riazuddin played a major role.

===Foundation===
The National Centre for Physics came into reality when Prof. Riazuddin arranged a one-day symposium on ''Frontiers of Fundamental Physics'' on 27 January 1999 at the Institute of Physics of Quaid-e-Azam University, only seven months before the recent tests, (''[[Chagai-I]]''). All the leading scientists of the country and some visitors from [[CERN]] attended this symposium and they provided their support. Prof. Riazuddin being the founding father of NCP, was its first Director-General and it was inaugurated by Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]], Chairman of [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] during this period, on 16 May 2000. The Director General of [[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] (CERN), Dr. [[Luciano Maiani]] and distinguished members of his delegation, the Vice-Chancellor of Quaid-i-Azam University, Dr. Tariq Saddiqui and other dignitaries, witnessed the inauguration.&lt;ref name="ncp.edu.pk"/&gt; The first academic faculty of this institute were included [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], [[Pervez Hoodbhoy]], [[Fayyazuddin|Fiazuddin]], [[Masud Ahmad]], and Ishfaq Ahmad, who first presented their physics papers to the institutes and CERN.

In 2008, Dr. Hamid Saleem became its Director-General after, his predecessor and founding father of NCP, Prof. Riazuddin, who was made lifetime Director General Emeritus. The vision of Prof. Riazuddin to make NCP one of the leading Physics institute of Pakistan is now being carried by Dr. Hamid Saleem.

NCP offers research in different branches of Physics such as [[particle Physics]], [[computational physics]], [[Astrophysics]], [[Cosmology]], [[Atmospheric physics]], [[Atomic, molecular, and optical physics]], [[Chemical physics]], [[Condensed matter physics]], ([[Fluid dynamics]], [[Laser Physics]], [[Mathematical physics]], [[Plasma Physics]]·, [[Quantum field theory]], Nano Physics, [[Quantum information]] theory

==Collaboration with CERN==
NCP is collaborating with CERN in the field of [[Particle physics#Experimental_laboratories|experimental high-energy physics]]. NCP and CERN are involved in the development, testing and fabrication of 432 [[Resistive plate chamber|Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC)]] required for the [[Compact Muon Solenoid#Layer_5_–_The_muon_detectors_and_return_yoke|CMS muon detector]] at CERN. The RPC has an excellent time resolution i.e. of the order of 1–2 nanoseconds and it will be used for the bunch tagging at [[LHC]]. At the national level, this project is a joint collaboration of NCP and PAEC, whereas at international level, NCP also collaborating with Italy, China, [[South Korea]] and US.

The RPC is a gaseous detector made using two parallel-plates of bakelite with high resistivity. Each RPC for CMS will be equipped with 96 electronic channels, which will be readout are based on 0.14 micrometre BiCMOS technology. For the complete system, number of readout channels are around 50,000. RNCP has an experimental high energy physics laboratory which is equipped with the high speed and advanced data acquisition system based on VME standards. This laboratory is used for prototyping and testing of RPCs at present.

===Advanced Scientific Computing===

High performance and data intense computing is the back bone of modern-day science. There are stringent requirements for computing at LHC. To exploit the full physics potential of LHC data in comprehensive manner. NCP will require high performance computing for accelerator physics, computational condensed matter physics and theoretical particle physics. For accessing and managing the LHC data novel techniques like the concept of data and computing grids are used. CERN has evolved a new project called the [[Worldwide LHC Computing Grid|LHC Computing Grid (LCG)]]. NCP is a partner of CERN in this project and it is the only LCG node in [[Pakistan]].

===International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)===
NCP signed a memorandum of understanding during dr. [[K. R. Sreenivasan]], Director ICTP's visit to Pakistan from 26 to 30 June 2005. In addition, the Centre carries out research in areas that are not covered by any institute of Physics. One such area being pursued by the Centre involves a number of activities in Experimental High-Energy Physics through a co-operative agreement with CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. Besides this, NCP has collaborations with several international institutes and universities in the field of theoretical physics including AS-ICTP, Trieste, Italy; Centre for Plasma Astrophysics (CPA), K-Leuven University, Belgium; Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan; Ruhr University, Bochum (RUB), Germany and many others. Several research papers are published in reputed international journals each year from NCP through national and international collaborations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12450">[[File:Bagasse in Hainan - 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sugarcane bagasse in [[Hainan]], China]]
'''Bagasse''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|ɡ|æ|s}} {{respell|bə|GAS|'}}) is the fibrous matter that remains after [[sugarcane]] or [[sorghum]] stalks are crushed to extract their juice. It is dry pulpy residue left after the extraction of juice from sugar cane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011737/bagasse|title=bagasse - fibre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagasse is used as a [[biofuel]] and in the manufacture of [[pulp (paper)|pulp]] and building materials.

Agave bagasse is a similar material that consists of the tissue of the [[Agave tequilana|blue agave]] after extraction of the sap.

Bagasse can be used to generate electricity. Dry bagasse is burnt to produce steam. The steam is used to rotate turbines to produce power.

==Production, storage and composition==
[[File:Engenho da Calheta 437.jpg|thumb|left|Sugarcane being crushed in Engenho da [[Calheta, Madeira|Calheta]], [[Madeira]]. The bagasse falls down a chute and is removed on a conveyor belt below.]]
For every 10 [[tonne]]s of sugarcane crushed, a sugar factory produces nearly three tonnes of wet bagasse. Since bagasse is a by-product of the cane sugar industry, the quantity of production in each country is in line with the quantity of sugarcane produced.

The high moisture content of bagasse, typically 40–50 percent, is detrimental to its use as a fuel. In general, bagasse is stored prior to further processing. For electricity production, it is stored under moist conditions, and the mild [[exothermic process]] that results from the degradation of residual sugars dries the bagasse pile slightly. For paper and pulp production, it is normally stored wet in order to assist in removal of the short [[pith]] fibres, which impede the paper making process, as well as to remove any remaining sugar.

A typical chemical analysis of washed and dried bagasse might show:&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rainey|first=Thomas J|title=A study of the permeability and compressibility properties of bagasse pulp|year=2009|publisher=Queensland University of Technology|location=Brisbane|url=http://eprints.qut.edu.au/view/person/Rainey,_Thomas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Cellulose]] 45–55 percent
*[[Hemicellulose]] 20–25 percent
*[[Lignin]] 18–24 percent
*Ash 1–4 percent
*[[Wax]]es &lt;1 percent

Bagasse is a [[heterogeneous]] material containing around 30-40 percent of "pith" fibre, which is derived from the core of the plant and is mainly [[parenchyma]] material, and "bast", "rind", or "stem" fibre, which makes up the balance and is largely derived from [[sclerenchyma]] material.  These properties make bagasse particularly problematic for paper manufacture and have been the subject of a large body of literature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Uses==
[[File:Proserpine-Sugar-Mill-rail-tracks-1188.jpg|thumb|Bagasse, covered with blue plastic, outside a sugar mill in [[Proserpine, Queensland]]]]

Many research efforts have explored using bagasse as a renewable [[power generation]] source and for the production of [[bio-based material]]s.

===Fuel===
Bagasse is often used as a primary fuel source for sugar mills. When burned in quantity, it produces sufficient heat energy to supply all the needs of a typical sugar mill, with energy to spare. To this end, a secondary use for this waste product is in [[cogeneration]], the use of a fuel source to provide both heat energy, used in the mill, and electricity, which is typically sold on to the consumer [[electrical grid]].

The lower calorific value (LCV) of bagasse in kJ/kg may be estimated using the formula: ''LCV'' = 18260 - 207.01 × ''Moisture'' - 31.14 × ''[[Brix]]'' - 182.60 × ''Ash'', where the moisture, brix and ash content of the bagasse are expressed as a percentage by mass. Similarly, the higher calorific value (HCV) of bagasse may be estimated using: ''HCV'' = 19605 - 196.05 × ''Moisture'' - 31.14 × ''Brix'' - 196.05 × ''Ash''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wienese|first=Arnoud|year=2001|title=Boilers, boiler fuel and boiler efficiency|url=http://www.sasta.co.za/wp-content/uploads/Proceedings/2000s/2001_wienese_BOILERS,%20BOILER%20FUEL%20AND.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the South African Sugar Technologists' Association|volume=75|pages=275–281|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are less than the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that the sugarcane plant absorbed from the atmosphere during its growing phase, which makes the process of cogeneration greenhouse-gas-neutral. In countries such as Australia, sugar factories contribute "green" power to the electricity grid.  [[Hawaiian Electric Industries]] also burns bagasse for cogeneration.

[[Ethanol]] produced from the sugar in sugarcane is a [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|popular fuel in Brazil]]. The cellulose-rich bagasse is being widely investigated for its potential for producing commercial quantities of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. For example, until May 2015 [[BP]] was operating a cellulosic ethanol demonstration plant based on cellulosic materials in [[Jennings, Louisiana]].

Bagasse's potential for advanced biofuels has been shown by several researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Jablonsky|first3=Michal|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Energy and chemical conversion of five Australian lignocellulosic feedstocks into bio-crude through liquefaction|journal=RSC Advances|date=24 May 2017|volume=7|issue=44|pages=27707–27717|doi=10.1039/C7RA02335A|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/RA/C7RA02335A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chumpoo|first1=Jade|last2= Prasassarakich|first2=Pattarapan|title=Bio-Oil from Hydro-Liquefaction of Bagasse in Supercritical Ethanol|journal=Energy&amp;Fuels|date=24 February 2010|volume=24|issue=3|pages=2071–2077|doi=10.1021/ef901241e}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the compatibility with conventional fuels and suitability of these crude fuels in conventional engines have yet to be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|issue=7|page=6765|doi=10.3390/en8076765|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/7/6765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pulp, paper, board and feed===
Bagasse is commonly used as a substitute for wood in many tropical and subtropical countries for the production of pulp, paper and board, such as India, China, Colombia, Iran, Thailand, and Argentina. It produces pulp with physical properties that are well suited for generic printing and writing papers as well as tissue products but it is also widely used for boxes and newspaper production.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It can also be used for making boards resembling plywood or particle board, called bagasse board and Xanita board, and is considered a good substitute for plywood. It has wide usage for making partitions and furniture.

The industrial process to convert bagasse into paper was developed in 1937 in a small laboratory in Hacienda Paramonga, a sugar mill on the coast of Peru owned by [[W. R. Grace and Company|W.R. Grace Company]]. With a promising method, the company bought an old paper mill in Whippany, New Jersey and shipped bagasse from Peru to test the viability of the process on an industrial scale. The first paper manufacturing machines were designed in Germany and installed in the Cartavio sugar cane plant in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grace: W.R. Grace &amp; Co., the Formative Years, 1850-1930|last=Lawrence A.|first=Clayton|publisher=Jameson Books|year=1985|isbn=978-0915463251|location=Ottawa, IL|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociedad Paramonga was bought in 1997 by Quimpac&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quimpac.com.pe/quienes.html|title=Quimpac corporate website|date=|website=Quimpac – Nuestra empresa: Quienes Somos|publisher=Quimpac|access-date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 produced 90,000 metric tons of office paper, toilet paper and cardboard for the Peruvian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quimpac.com.pe/descripcion_papel.html|title=Quimpac paper division|date=|website=Quimpac – Negocios Papel|publisher=Quimpac|access-date=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

K-Much Industry has patented a method of converting bagasse into cattle feed by mixing it with molasses and enzymes (such as bromelain) and fermenting it. It is marketed in Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, Korea, Taiwan and Middle East and Australia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Xanita, a South African company, mixes 30 percent bagasse cellulose fibres in with recycled [[kraft paper]] fibre to make ultra-lightweight composite boards. These are sold as an environmentally friendly, formaldehyde-free alternative to [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF]] and [[particle board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xanita.com|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nanocellulose ===
[[Nanocellulose]] can be produced from bagasse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-11-01|title=Mechanical, barrier, and biodegradability properties of bagasse cellulose whiskers reinforced natural rubber nanocomposites|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669010001962|journal=Industrial Crops and Products|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=627–633|doi=10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.07.018|issn=0926-6690}}&lt;/ref&gt; through various conventional and novel processes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sofla|first=M.

J.|date=2016|title=A comparison of cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibres extracted from bagasse using acid and ball milling methods|url=http://stacks.iop.org/2043-6262/7/i=3/a=035004|journal=Advances in Natural Sciences: Nanoscience and Nanotechnology|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=035004|doi=10.1088/2043-6262/7/3/035004|issn=2043-6262}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This provides a pathway to generate higher-value products from what can be considered a process waste stream. 

==Health impact==

Workplace exposure to dust from the processing of bagasse can cause the chronic lung condition [[pulmonary fibrosis]], more specifically referred to as [[bagassosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.chestjournal.org/content/52/4/505.full.pdf|title=Bagasse Disease of the Lungs – After 25 Years|date=October 1967|journal=Chest|author=Sodeman, William A|pages=505–507|volume=52|doi=10.1378/chest.52.4.505|format=PDF|issue=4|pmid=6058449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human consumption===

Processed bagasse is added to human food as sugarcane fiber.&lt;ref name="nutrition411.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nutrition411.com/content/fiber-facts-understanding-food-labels-and-isolated-fibers | title=Fiber Facts: Understanding Food Labels and Isolated Fibers |work=Nutrition411}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a soluble fiber but can help promote intestinal regularity.&lt;ref name="nutrition411.com"/&gt; One animal study suggests that sugarcane fiber combined with a high-fat diet may help control [[type 2 diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2730183 | pmid=17998014 | doi=10.1016/j.metabol.2007.07.004 | volume=56 | issue=12 | title=Effects of dietary fibers on weight gain, carbohydrate metabolism, and gastric ghrelin gene expression in mice fed a high-fat diet | year=2007 | journal=Metab.

Exp. | pages=1635–42 |vauthors=Wang ZQ, Zuberi AR, Zhang XH, Macgowan J, Qin J, Ye X, Son L, Wu Q, Lian K, Cefalu WT }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagasse are good sources of lignoceric and cerotic acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=30052146 | doi=10.1080/07315724.2018.1484307 | title=Nutrient and Antioxidant Properties of Oils from Bagasses, Agricultural Residues, Medicinal Plants, and Fodders | year=2018 | journal=J Am Coll Nutr. | pages=1–9 |vauthors=Nnabugwu Agomuo E, Amadi Peter U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]], [[China]], bagasse is sometimes used to smoke bacon and sausages.

'''Blogdex''' was an online resource for understanding hot topics of discussion in the [[blogosphere]].

The site offered a time-weighted list of links to online content cited by more than one monitored [[blog]] in the recent past. Each link received a score based both on the number of different blogs citing it and the recency of those citings; the list thus typically features both popular oddities of the day as well as informative and/or controversial source material for current topics of public debate. Despite its explicit focus on blogs, it can be thought of as the original [[memetracker]], and the inspiration for later commercial sites such as [[tailrank.com]], [[Digg|Digg.com]], and other [[social media]] sites.

As the previous owner of the domains blogdex.com, blogdex.net and blogdex.org, [[Jimmy Wales]] offered the domains to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] free of charge for use in this project. Blogdex then migrated from the original blogdex.media.mit.edu location to blogdex.net.

Blogdex was created by [[Cameron Marlow]], then a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student at MIT along with [[Elizabeth Wood (Blogdex)|Elizabeth Wood]], then a high school student attending the [[Research_Science_Institute|RSI]] summer program at MIT. Marlow now works for [[Facebook]].

Blogdex has been offline since May 2006.

'''Campo Verde Solar Project''' is a 139-[[megawatt]] (MW[[watt-peak AC|&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;]]) solar [[photovoltaic power station]] in [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]], [[California]]. The project was approved in December 2012. Construction began in early 2013 and was completed the same year. Designed and constructed by U.S. [[thin-film solar cell|thin-film ]] manufacturer [[First Solar]], the plant uses nearly 2.3 million [[CdTe-PV]] modules. Campo Verde Solar was acquired in April 2013 by [[Southern Company|Southern Power]] and [[Turner Renewable Energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.firstsolar.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=758547 |title=First Solar Sells 139-Megawatt Campo Verde Solar Project |work=First Solar |date=April 23, 2013 |access-date=2014-05-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901130149/http://investor.firstsolar.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=758547# |archive-date=2013-09-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First Solar acquired the project in 2012 from US Solar Holdings LLC, which had developed the project and negotiated the 139 MW PPA with SDG&amp;E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.firstsolar.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=697383 |title=First Solar Acquires US Solar 139 MW Project |work=US Solar Holdings |date=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''carbenium ion''' is a [[cation|positive ion]] with the structure RR′R″C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, a [[chemical species]] with a [[Valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] carbon that bears a +1 [[formal charge]].

In older literature the name '''carbonium ion''' was used for this class, but now it refers exclusively to another family of [[carbocation]]s, the [[carbonium ion]]s, where the charged carbon is [[Valence (chemistry)|pentavalent]].&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C00839.html ''carbonium ion'']&lt;/ref&gt; The current definitions were proposed by the chemist [[George Andrew Olah]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;"Stable carbocations. CXVIII. General concept and structure of carbocations based on differentiation of trivalent (classical) carbenium ions from three-center bound penta- of tetracoordinated (nonclassical) carbonium ions. Role of carbocations in electrophilic reactions" [[George Andrew Olah]]; ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.''; 1972; '''94'''(3); 808–820.&lt;/ref&gt; and are now widely accepted.

Carbenium ions are generally highly reactive due to having an incomplete [[octet rule|octet]] of electrons; however, certain carbenium ions, such as the [[tropylium cation|tropylium]] ion, are relatively stable due to the positive charge being delocalised between the carbon atoms.

==Nomenclature ==

Carbenium ions are classified as [[primary carbon|primary]], [[secondary carbon|secondary]], or [[tertiary carbon|tertiary]] depending on whether the number of carbon atoms bonded to the ionized carbon is 1, 2, or 3. (Ions with zero carbons attached to the ionized carbon, such as [[methenium]], {{chem|CH|3|+}}, are usually included in the primary class).

== Reactivity ==
Stability typically increases with the number of [[alkyl groups]] bonded to the charge-bearing carbon. Tertiary carbocations are more stable (and form more readily) than secondary carbocations, because they are stabilized by [[hyperconjugation]]. Primary carbocations are highly unstable. Therefore, reactions such as the [[SN1 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 reaction]] and the E1 [[elimination reaction]] normally do not occur if a primary carbenium would be formed.

However, a carbon doubly bonded with the ionized carbon can stabilize the ion by [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]]. Such cations as the ''[[allyl]]'' cation, {{chem|CH|2|{{=}}CH–CH|2|+}}, and the ''[[benzyl]]'' cation, {{chem|C|6|H|5|–CH|2|+}}, are more stable than most other carbocations. Molecules which can form allyl or benzyl carbeniums are especially reactive. Carbenium ions can also be stabilized by [[heteroatom]]s.&lt;ref name=Gruetz&gt;Hansjörg Grützmacher, Christina M. Marchand (1997), "Heteroatom stabilized carbenium ions", ''Coord. Chem. Rev.'', '''163''', 287–344. {{doi|10.1016/S0010-8545(97)00043-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbenium ions may undergo [[rearrangement reaction]]s from less stable structures to equally stable or more stable ones with [[rate constant]]s in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This fact complicates synthetic pathways to many compounds. For example, when 3-pentanol is heated with aqueous HCl, the initially formed 3-pentyl carbocation rearranges to a statistical mixture of the 3-pentyl and 2-pentyl. These cations react with chloride ion to produce about {{frac|1|3}} 3-chloropentane and {{frac|2|3}} 2-chloropentane.

==Types of carbenium ions==

===Alkylium ions===
Carbenium ions can be prepared directly from [[alkane]]s by removing a [[hydride]] anion, {{chem|H|-}}, with a strong acid. For example, [[magic acid]], a mixture of [[antimony pentafluoride]] ({{chem|SbF|5}}) and [[fluorosulfuric acid]] ({{chem|FSO|3|H}}), turns [[isobutane]] into the cation {{chem|(CH|3|)|3|C|+}}.&lt;ref name=olah&gt;George A. Olah and Joachim Lukas (1967), "Stable Carbonium Ions. XLVII. Alkylcarbonium ion 
formation from alkanes via hydride (alkide) ion abstraction in fluorosulfonic acid-antimony pentafluoride-sulfuryl chlorofluoride solution". ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''89''' (18), 4739–4744. {{doi|10.1021/ja00994a030}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aromatic carbenium ions===
{{Main article|Tropylium cation}}
[[Image:Tropylium-ion-3D-balls.png|150px|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of the tropylium cation.]]
The '''tropylium ion''' is an [[aromatic]] species with the formula {{chem|C|7|H|7|+}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=molecule|file=M04002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from the molecule [[tropine]] (itself named for the molecule [[atropine]]). Salts of the tropylium cation can be stable, e.g. [[tropylium tetrafluoroborate]]. It can be made from [[cycloheptatriene]] (tropylidene) and [[bromine]] or [[phosphorus pentachloride]]&lt;ref&gt;"Tropylium tetrafluorate" ''Organic Syntheses, Coll.'' Vol. '''5''', p.1138 (1973); Vol. '''43''', p.101 (1963). [http://orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV5P1138.pdf link]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[heptagon]]al, planar, cyclic ion; it also has 6 π-electrons (4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2, where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), which fulfills [[Hückel's rule]] of aromaticity. It can coordinate as a [[ligand]] to [[metal]] [[atoms]].

The structure shown is a composite of seven [[resonance contributor]]s in which each carbon carries part of the positive charge.

In 1891 G.&amp;nbsp;Merling obtained a water-soluble salt from a reaction of [[cycloheptatriene]] and [[bromine]].&lt;ref&gt;Merling, G. (1891), "Ueber Tropin". ''Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft'', '''24''': 3108–3126. {{doi|10.1002/cber.189102402151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was elucidated by [[William von Eggers Doering|Eggers Doering]] and Knox in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;"The Cycloheptatrienylium (Tropylium) Ion" W. von E. Doering, L. H. Knox ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', 1954, '''76''' (12), pp 3203–3206 {{DOI|10.1021/ja01641a027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Aromaticity as a Cornerstone of Heterocyclic Chemistry" Alexandru T. Balaban, Daniela C. Oniciu, Alan R. Katritzky ''Chem. Rev.'', 2004, '''104''' (5), 2777–2812 {{DOI|10.1021/cr0306790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aromatic carbenium ion is the cyclopropenyl or [[cyclopropenium ion]], {{chem|C|3|H|3|+}}, obtained by Ronald Breslow and John T. Groves in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"Cyclopropenyl Cation. Synthesis and Characterization." R. Breslow and J. T. Groves ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' , 1970, '''92''' (4), 984–987 [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja00707a040]&lt;/ref&gt; Though less stable than the tropylium cation, this carbenium ion can also form salts at room temperature. Solutions of such salts were found by Breslow and Groves to have spectroscopic and chemical properties matching expectations for an aromatic carbenium ion.

===Triphenylmethyl (trityl) cation===

[[Image:Triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate.gif|200px|thumb|Structure of [[triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate]].]]
The [[triphenylmethane|triphenylmethyl]] cation, {{chem|C(C|6|H|5|)|3|+}}, is especially stable because the positive charge can be distributed among 10 of the carbon atoms (the 3 carbon atoms in the ''ortho'' and ''para'' positions of each of the three phenyl groups, plus the central carbon atom). It exists in the compounds [[triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate]] (C(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[triphenylmethyl perchlorate]] (C(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

Triphenylmethyl hexafluorophosphate is used as a [[catalyst]] and [[reagent]] in organic syntheses;&lt;ref name=Urch&gt;{{cite journal |author=Urch, C. |title=Triphenylmethyl Hexafluorophosphate |journal=Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis |year=2001 |doi=10.1002/047084289X.rt363f}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is generated by combining [[silver hexafluorophosphate]] with [[triphenylmethyl chloride]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharp, D. |author2=Shepard, N. |title=Complex Fluorides. Part VIII |journal=University Chemical Laboratory, Cambridge |year=1956 |pages=674–682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:AgPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + C(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl → C(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + AgCl

These and other similar cations can be obtained as intensely colored solutions by dissolving [[aryl]]-substituted [[methanol]]s in concentrated [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name=deno&gt;N. C. Deno, J. J. Jaruzelski, and Alan Schriesheim (1955) "Carbonium ions. I. An acidity function (''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) derived from arylcarbonium ion equilibria." ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', '''77''' (11), 3044–3051. {{doi|10.1021/ja01616a036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arenium ions===
{{main article|Arenium ion}}
[[Image:Benzenium-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of the benzenium ion]]

An '''arenium ion''' is a cyclohexadienyl cation that appears as a reactive intermediate in [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;"Stable carbocations. CXVIII. General concept and structure of carbocations based on differentiation of trivalent (classical) carbenium ions from three-center bound penta- of tetracoordinated (nonclassical) carbonium ions. Role of carbocations in electrophilic reactions" [[George A. Olah]] ''[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]''; 1972; '''94'''(3) 808–820; {{DOI|10.1021/ja00758a020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For historic reasons this complex is also called a ''Wheland intermediate'',&lt;ref&gt;"A Quantum Mechanical Investigation of the Orientation of Substituents in Aromatic Molecules" G. W. Wheland ''[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]''; 1942; '''64'''(4) 900–908; {{DOI|10.1021/ja01256a047}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''σ-complex''.
:[[Image:AreniumIon.png|400px|benzenium ion]]
Two hydrogen atoms bonded to one carbon lie in a plane perpendicular to the benzene ring.&lt;ref&gt;''A guidebook to mechanism in organic chemistry'', [[Peter Sykes (chemist)|Peter Sykes]]; pp 130–133&lt;/ref&gt; The arenium ion is no longer an aromatic species; however it is relatively stable due to delocalization: the positive charge is delocalized over 5 carbon atoms via the [[Pi orbital|π system]], as depicted on the following [[resonance structures]]:
:[[Image:AreniumIonResonance.png|500px|Arenium ion resonance structures]]
Another contribution to the stability of arenium ions is the energy gain resulting from the strong bond between the benzene and the complexed electrophile.

The smallest arenium ion is protonated [[benzene]], {{chem|C|6|H|7|+}}. The '''benzenium ion''' can be isolated as a stable compound when benzene is protonated by the [[carborane superacid]], H(CB&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;"Isolating Benzenium Ion Salts" Christopher A. Reed, Kee-Chan Kim, Evgenii S. Stoyanov, Daniel Stasko, Fook S. Tham, Leonard J. Mueller, and Peter D. W. Boyd ''[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]''; 2003; '''125'''(7) 1796–1804; {{DOI|10.1021/ja027336o}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benzenium salt is crystalline with thermal stability up to 150&amp;nbsp;°C. [[Bond length]]s deduced from [[X-ray crystallography]] are consistent with a cyclohexadienyl cation structure.

===Acylium ions===
{{main article|Acyl#Acylium cations, anions, and radicals}}
An '''acylium ion''' is a cation with the formula RCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Compendium of Chemical Terminology]]'', [http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00123.html acyl groups]&lt;/ref&gt; The structure is described as R−C≡O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or R−{{overset|+|C}}=O. It is the [[synthon|synthetic and reactive equivalent]] of an acyl carbocation, but the actual structure has the oxygen and carbon linked by a triple bond. Such species are common reactive intermediates, for example, in the [[Friedel−Crafts acylation]]s also in many other [[organic reaction]]s such as the [[Hayashi rearrangement]]. Salts containing acylium ions can be generated by removal of the halide from [[acyl halide]]s: 
:RCOCl + SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → RCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;{{chem|SbCl|6|−}}
The C–O distance in these cations is near 1.1 [[ångström]]s, even shorter than that in [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=B. |last1=Chevrier |first2=J. M. |last2=Le Carpentier |first3=R. |last3=Weiss |title=Synthesis of two crystalline species of the Friedel–Crafts intermediate antimony pentachloride-''p''-toluoyl chloride. Crystal structures of the donor–acceptor complex and of the ionic salt |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |date=1972 |volume=94 |page=5718–5723 |doi=10.1021/ja00771a031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acylium cations are characteristic fragments observed in EI-[[mass spectra]] of [[ketone]]s.

'''Cetyl alcohol''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|əl}}, also known as '''hexadecan-1-ol''' and '''palmityl alcohol''', is a [[fatty alcohol]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;OH. At room temperature, cetyl alcohol takes the form of a [[wax]]y white solid or flakes.  The name '''cetyl''' derives from the [[whale oil]] ({{lang-la|cetus}}) from which it was first isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nordegren | first = Thomas | authorlink = | title = The A-Z Encyclopedia of Alcohol and Drug Abuse | publisher = Universal Publishers | year = 2002 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58112-404-X| page = 165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparation==
Cetyl alcohol was discovered in 1817 by the French [[chemist]] [[Michel Eugène Chevreul|Michel Chevreul]] when he heated [[spermaceti]], a waxy substance obtained from [[sperm whale]] oil, with caustic potash ([[potassium hydroxide]]). Flakes of cetyl alcohol were left behind on cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Booth | first = James Curtis | authorlink = James Curtis Booth| title = The Encyclopedia of Chemistry, Practical and Theoretical | publisher = | year = 1862 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =| page = 429 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern production is based around the reduction of [[palmitic acid]], which is obtained from [[palm oil]].

== Uses ==
Cetyl alcohol is used in the cosmetic industry as an [[opacifier]] in [[shampoo]]s, or as an [[emollient]], [[emulsifier]] or [[thickening agent]] in the manufacture of skin creams and lotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smolinske | first = Susan C | authorlink = | title = Handbook of Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Excipients | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1992 | location = | pages = 75–76 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8493-3585-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also employed as a [[lubricant]] for nuts and bolts, and is the active ingredient in some "liquid pool covers" (forming a surface layer to reduce evaporation and retain heat).

== Side effects ==
People who suffer from [[eczema]] can be sensitive to cetyl alcohol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4238421 | year = 1969 | last1 = Gaul | first1 = LE | title = Dermatitis from cetyl and stearyl alcohols | volume = 99 | issue = 5 | pages = 593 | journal = Archives of Dermatology | doi = 10.1001/archderm.1969.01610230085016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15059111 | year = 2004 | last1 = Soga | first1 = F | last2 = Katoh | first2 = N | last3 = Kishimoto | first3 = S | title = Contact dermatitis due to lanoconazole, cetyl alcohol and diethyl sebacate in lanoconazole cream | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–50 | doi = 10.1111/j.0105-1873.2004.00271j.x | journal = Contact dermatitis}}
&lt;/ref&gt; though this may be due to impurities rather than cetyl alcohol itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9034687 | year = 1997 | last1 = Komamura | first1 = H | last2 = Doi | first2 = T | last3 = Inui | first3 = S | last4 = Yoshikawa | first4 = K | title = A case of contact dermatitis due to impurities of cetyl alcohol | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–6 | journal = Contact dermatitis | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1997.tb00921.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, cetyl alcohol ''is'' sometimes included in medications used for the treatment of eczema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kato N|author2=Numata T |author3=Kanzaki T |title= Contact dermatitis due to Japanese pharmacopeia cetyl alcohol| journal= Skin Research | volume = 29| issue= suppl 3 | pages = 258–262|year = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coal upgrading technology''' refers to a class of technologies developed to remove moisture and certain pollutants from  [[coal rank|low rank]] coals such as sub-[[Bituminous coal]] and [[lignite]] ([[brown coal]]) and raise their calorific values. Companies located in Australia, Germany and the United States are the principal drivers of the research, development and commercialisation of these technologies.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Environmental rationale ==
Around 30 nations collectively operate more than 1,400 brown coal-fired power stations around the world. Brown coal power stations that cannot economically dewater brown coal are inefficient and cause of high levels of [[carbon emissions]]. High emitting power stations, notably the [[Hazelwood power station]] in [[Australia]], attract environmental criticism. Many modern economies including [[Greece]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (Australia) are highly dependent on brown coal for electricity. Improved environmental performance and the need for stable economic environment provide incentive for investment to substantially reduce the negative environmental impact of burning raw ('as mined') brown coal.

== Economic rationale ==
Coal upgrading technologies remove moisture from 'as mined' brown coal and transform the calorific performance of brown coal to a 'cleaner' burning status relatively equivalent to high calorific value black coal. Some coal upgrading processes result in a [[densified coal]] product that is considered to be a [[Black coal equivalent]] product suitable for burning in black coal boilers.

Victorian brown coal with a characteristic moisture content of 60% by weight is regarded as the 'wettest' brown coal in the world. The high moisture content is the key reason why the state's three major power stations are collectively regarded as the dirtiest carbon emitters in the world. Studies undertaken by the [[University of Melbourne]] &lt;ref&gt;Reactivity and Reactions of Australian brown coals. R.B. Johns and A.G. Pandolfo Dept Organic Chemistry, University of Melbourne. 1980 
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Monash University]] confirm that when moisture is removed from Victorian brown coal, naturally low levels of ash, sulfur and other elements rank it as being one of the cleanest coals in the world. When dewatered upgraded brown coal can compete in the export market at comparable prices to black coal.

With significant levels of brown coal mining occurring around the world, and mining levels increasing, the need for coal upgrading technologies has become more apparent. the technologies will help to address global environmental concern of rising emissions from the burning of brown coal and provide alternative fuel options to rapidly emerging economies such as Vietnam that face difficulty competing for black coal with China, India, Japan and other nations.

== Technology comparison ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}

Because of inherent high moisture content, all lignites need to be dried prior to combustion. Depending on the technology type drying is achieved either via a discrete operation or part of a process. The comparison chart identifies different technology drying methods that are in development in different countries and provides a qualitative comparison.

Composites are further divided into main two classification  they are ... resin material and matrix material

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11068">The '''Debye sheath''' (also '''electrostatic sheath''') is a layer in a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] which has a greater density of positive ions, and hence an overall excess positive charge, that balances an opposite negative charge on the surface of a material with which it is in contact. The thickness of such a layer is several [[Debye length]]s thick, a value whose size depends on various characteristics of plasma (e.g. temperature, density, etc.).

A Debye sheath arises in a plasma because the electrons usually have a temperature on the order of magnitude or greater than that of the ions and are much lighter. Consequently, they are faster than the ions by at least a factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m_\mathrm{i}/m_\mathrm{e}}&lt;/math&gt;. At the interface to a material surface, therefore, the electrons will fly out of the plasma, charging the surface negative relative to the bulk plasma. Due to [[Debye shielding]], the scale length of the transition region will be the [[Debye length]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\mathrm{D}&lt;/math&gt;. As the potential increases, more and more electrons are reflected by the sheath potential. An equilibrium is finally reached when the potential difference is a few times the electron temperature.

The Debye sheath is the transition from a plasma to a solid surface. Similar physics is involved between two plasma regions that have different characteristics; the transition between these regions is known as a [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]], and features one positive, and one negative layer.

==Description==
[[Image:plasma-sheath.svg|thumb|300px|Positive ion '''sheaths''' around grid wires in a thermionic gas tube, where &lt;span style="font-size:150%;color:red"&gt;⊕&lt;/span&gt; represents a positive charge (not to scale) (After Langmuir, 1929)]]
Sheaths were first described by American physicist [[Irving Langmuir]]. In 1923 he wrote:
:"Electrons are repelled from the negative electrode while positive ions are drawn towards it. Around each negative electrode there is thus a ''sheath'' of definite thickness containing only positive ions and neutral atoms. [..] Electrons are reflected from the outside surface of the sheath while all ''positive'' ions which reach the sheath are attracted to the electrode. [..] it follows directly that no change occurs in the positive ion current reaching the electrode. The electrode is in fact perfectly screened from the discharge by the positive ion sheath, and its potential cannot influence the phenomena occurring in the arc, nor the current flowing to the electrode."&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, Irving, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1923Sci....58..290L Positive Ion Currents from the Positive Column of Mercury Arcs]" (1923) ''Science'', Volume 58, Issue 1502, pp. 290-291&lt;/ref&gt;

Langmuir and co-author [[Albert Hull|Albert W. Hull]] further described a sheath formed in a [[thermionic valve]]:
:"Figure 1 shows graphically the condition that exists in such a tube containing mercury vapor. The space between filament and plate is filled with a mixture of electrons and positive ions, in nearly equal numbers, to which has been given the name "plasma". A wire immersed in the plasma, at zero potential with respect to it, will absorb every ion and electron that strikes it. Since the electrons move about 600 times as fast as the ions, 600 times as many electrons will strike the wire as ions. If the wire is insulated it must assume such a negative potential that it receives equal numbers of electrons and ions, that is, such a potential that it repels all but 1 in 600 of the electrons headed for it."
:"Suppose that this wire, which we may take to be part of a grid, is made still more negative with a view to controlling the current through the tube. It will now repel all the electrons headed for it, but will receive all the positive ions that fly toward it. There will thus be a region around the wire which contains positive ions and no electrons, as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. The ions are accelerated as they approach the negative wire, and there will exist a potential gradient in this sheath, as we may call it, of positive ions, such that the potential is less and less negative as we recede from the wire, and at a certain distance is equal to the potential of the plasma. This distance we define as the boundary of the sheath. Beyond this distance there is no effect due to the potential of the wire."&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;Albert W. Hull and Irving Langmuir, "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=522437 Control of an Arc Discharge by Means of a Grid]", ''Proc Natl Acad Sci USA''. 1929 March 15; 15(3): 218–225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical treatment==

=== The planar sheath equation ===

The quantitative physics of the Debye sheath is determined by four phenomena:
  
'''Energy conservation of the ions:''' If we assume for simplicity cold ions of mass &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{i}&lt;/math&gt; entering the sheath with a velocity &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt;, having charge opposite to the electron, conservation of energy in the sheath potential requires

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}m_\mathrm{i}\,u(x)^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_\mathrm{i}\,u_0^2 - e\,\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the charge of the electron taken positively, i.e. &lt;math&gt;e=1.602&lt;/math&gt; x &lt;math&gt;10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Ion continuity:''' In the steady state, the ions do not build up anywhere, so the flux is everywhere the same:

&lt;math&gt;n_0\,u_0 = n_\mathrm{i}(x)\,u(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''[[Boltzmann relation]] for the electrons:''' Since most of the electrons are reflected, their density is given by

&lt;math&gt;n_\mathrm{e}(x) = n_0 \exp\Big(\frac{e\,\varphi(x)}{k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{e}}\Big)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''[[Poisson's equation]]:''' The curvature of the electrostatic potential is related to the net charge density as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\varphi(x)}{dx^2} = \frac{e (n_\mathrm{e}(x)-n_\mathrm{i}(x))}{\epsilon_0} &lt;/math&gt;.

Combining these equations and writing them in terms of the dimensionless potential, position, and ion speed,

&lt;math&gt;\chi(\xi) = -\frac{e\varphi(\xi)}{k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{e}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\xi = \frac{x}{\lambda_\mathrm{D}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M} = \frac{u_\mathrm{o}}{(k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{e}/m_\mathrm{i})^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;

we arrive at the sheath equation:

&lt;math&gt;\chi'' = \left( 1 + \frac{2\chi}{\mathfrak{M}^2} \right)^{-1/2} - e^{-\chi}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The Bohm sheath criterion===
The sheath equation can be integrated once by multiplying by &lt;math&gt;\chi'&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\xi \chi' \chi''\,d\xi_1 = 
\int_0^\xi \left( 1 + \frac{2\chi}{\mathfrak{M}^2} \right)^{-1/2} \chi' \,d\xi_1 - 
\int_0^\xi e^{-\chi} \chi'\,d\xi_1 
&lt;/math&gt;

At the sheath edge (&lt;math&gt;\xi = 0&lt;/math&gt;), we can define the potential to be zero (&lt;math&gt;\chi = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and assume that the electric field is also zero (&lt;math&gt;\chi'=0&lt;/math&gt;). With these boundary conditions, the integrations yield

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\chi'^2 = \mathfrak{M}^2 \left[ \left( 1 + \frac{2\chi}{\mathfrak{M}^2} \right)^{1/2} - 1 \right] + e^{-\chi} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

This is easily rewritten as an integral in closed form, although one that can only be solved numerically. Nevertheless, an important piece of information can be derived analytically. Since the left-hand-side is a square, the right-hand-side must also be non-negative for every value of &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, in particular for small values. Looking at the Taylor expansion around &lt;math&gt;\chi = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we see that the first term that does not vanish is the quadratic one, so that we can require

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\chi^2\left( -\frac{1}{\mathfrak{M}^2} + 1 \right) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;,

or

&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}^2 \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;,

or

&lt;math&gt;u_0 \ge (k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{e}/m_\mathrm{i})^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This inequality is known as the '''Bohm sheath criterion''' after its discoverer, [[David Bohm]]. If the ions are entering the sheath too slowly, the sheath potential will "eat" its way into the plasma to accelerate them. Ultimately a so-called '''pre-sheath''' will develop with a potential drop on the order of &lt;math&gt;(k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{e}/2e)&lt;/math&gt; and a scale determined by the physics of the ion source (often the same as the dimensions of the plasma). Normally the Bohm criterion will hold with equality, but there are some situations where the ions enter the sheath with supersonic speed.

=== The Child–Langmuir law ===

Although the sheath equation must generally be integrated numerically, we can find an approximate solution analytically by neglecting the &lt;math&gt;e^{-\chi}&lt;/math&gt; term. This amounts to neglecting the electron density in the sheath, or only analyzing that part of the sheath where there are no electrons. For a "floating" surface, i.e. one that draws no net current from the plasma, this is a useful if rough approximation. For a surface biased strongly negative so that it draws the '''ion saturation current''', the approximation is very good. It is customary, although not strictly necessary, to further simplify the equation by assuming that &lt;math&gt;2\chi/\mathfrak{M}^2&lt;/math&gt; is much larger than unity. Then the sheath equation takes on the simple form

&lt;math&gt;\chi'' = \frac{\mathfrak{M}}{(2\chi)^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

As before, we multiply by &lt;math&gt;\chi'&lt;/math&gt; and integrate to obtain

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\chi'^2 = \mathfrak{M} (2\chi)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;,

or

&lt;math&gt;\chi^{-1/4}\chi' = 2^{3/4} \mathfrak{M}^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is easily integrated over ξ to yield

&lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\chi_\mathrm{w}^{3/4} = 2^{3/4} \mathfrak{M}^{1/2} d&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\chi_\mathrm{w}&lt;/math&gt; is the (normalized) potential at the wall (relative to the sheath edge), and ''d'' is the thickness of the sheath. Changing back to the variables &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and noting that the ion current into the wall is &lt;math&gt;J=e\,n_0\,u_0&lt;/math&gt;, we have

&lt;math&gt;J = \frac{4}{9} \left(\frac{2e}{m_i}\right)^{1/2} \frac{|\varphi_w|^{3/2}}{4\pi d^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation is known as '''Child's law''', after [[Clement D. Child]] (1868–1933), who first published it in 1911, or as the '''Child–Langmuir law''', honoring as well [[Irving Langmuir]], who discovered it independently and published in 1913. It was first used to give the space-charge-limited current in a vacuum diode with electrode spacing ''d''. It can also be inverted to give the thickness of the Debye sheath as a function of the voltage drop by setting &lt;math&gt;J=j_\mathrm{ion}^\mathrm{sat}&lt;/math&gt;:

A '''diffusionless transformation''' is a [[Phase transition|phase change]] that occurs without the long-range [[diffusion]] of [[atoms]] but rather by some form of cooperative, homogeneous movement of many atoms that results in a change in crystal structure. These movements are small, usually less than the interatomic distances, and the atoms maintain their relative relationships. The ordered movement of large numbers of atoms lead some to refer to these as ''military'' transformations in contrast to ''civilian'' diffusion-based phase changes.&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Porter and K.E. Easterling, Phase transformations in metals and alloys, ''Chapman &amp; Hall'', 1992, p.172 {{ISBN|0-412-45030-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly encountered transformation of this type is the [[Adolf Martens|martensitic]] transformation which, while being probably the most studied, is only one subset of non-diffusional transformations. The martensitic transformation in steel represents the most economically significant example of this category of phase transformations but an increasing number of alternatives, such as [[shape memory alloy]]s, are becoming more important as well.

== Classification and definitions ==
When a structural change occurs by the coordinated movement of atoms (or groups of atoms) relative to their neighbors then the change is termed ''displacive'' transformation. This covers a broad range of transformations and so further classifications have been developed [Cohen 1979].

The first distinction can be drawn between transformations dominated by ''lattice-distortive strains'' and those where ''shuffles'' are of greater importance.

Homogeneous lattice-distortive strains, also known as Bain strains, are strains that transform one [[Bravais lattice]] into a different one. This can be represented by a strain [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] '''S''' which transforms one vector, '''y''', into a new vector, '''x''':

:&lt;math&gt;y=Sx&lt;/math&gt;

This is homogeneous as straight lines are transformed to new straight lines. Examples of such transformations include a [[Cubic crystal system|cubic lattice]] increasing in size on all three axes (dilation) or [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] into a [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] structure.

[[File:diffusionless shuffles distortions.svg|350px|thumbnail|right]]

Shuffles, as the name suggests, involve the small movement of atoms within the unit cell. As a result, pure shuffles do not normally result in a shape change of the unit cell - only its symmetry and structure.

Phase transformations normally result in the creation of an interface between the transformed and parent material. The energy required to generate this new interface will depend on its nature - essentially how well the two structures fit together. An additional energy term occurs if the transformation includes a shape change since, if the new phase is constrained by the surrounding material, this may give rise to [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[plastic]] deformation and hence a [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] energy term. The ratio of these interfacial and strain energy terms has a notable effect on the kinetics of the transformation and the morphology of the new phase. Thus, shuffle transformations, where distortions are small, are dominated by interfacial energies and can be usefully separated from lattice-distortive transformations where the strain energy tends to have a greater effect.

A subclassification of lattice-distortive displacements can be made by considering the dilational and shear components of the distortion. In transformations dominated by the shear component, it is possible to find a line in the new phase that is undistorted from the [[parent phase]] while all lines are distorted when the dilation is predominant. Shear dominated transformations can be further classified according to the magnitude of the strain energies involved compared to the innate [[Atom vibrations|vibrations]] of the atoms in the lattice and hence whether the strain energies have a notable influence on the kinetics of the transformation and the morphology of the resulting phase. If the strain energy is a significant factor then the transformations are dubbed ''martensitic'' and if it is not the transformation is referred to as ''quasi-martensitic''.

==Iron-Carbon Martensitic transformation==&lt;!-- [[Martensitic transformation]] links here --&gt;
The difference between [[austenite]] and [[martensite]] is, in some ways, quite small: while the unit cell of austenite is, on average, a perfect cube, the transformation to martensite distorts this cube by interstitial carbon atoms that do not have time to diffuse out during displacive transformation. The unit cell becomes slightly longer in one dimension and shorter in the other two. The mathematical description of the two structures is quite different, for reasons of symmetry (see external links), but the chemical bonding remains very similar. Unlike [[cementite]], which has bonding reminiscent of ceramic materials, the hardness of martensite is difficult to explain in chemical terms.

The explanation hinges on the crystal's subtle change in dimension. Even a microscopic crystallite is millions of unit cells long. Since all of these units face the same direction, distortions of even a fraction of a percent become magnified into a major mismatch between neighboring materials. The mismatch is sorted out by the creation of myriad [[crystal defect]]s, in a process reminiscent of [[work hardening]]. As in work-hardened steel, these defects prevent atoms from sliding past one another in an organized fashion, causing the material to become harder.

Shape memory alloys also have surprising mechanical properties, that were eventually explained by an analogy to martensite. Unlike the iron-carbon system, alloys in the nickel-titanium system can be chosen that make the "martensitic" phase [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] stable.

==Pseudomartensitic transformation==
In addition to displacive transformation and diffusive transformation, a new phase transformation that involves displasive sublattice transition and atomic diffusion was discovered using a high-pressure x-ray diffraction system.&lt;ref&gt;Jiuhua Chen, Donald J. Weidner, John B. Parise, Michael T. Vaughan, and Paul Raterron, (2001) [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v86/i18/p4072_1 Observation of Cation Reordering during the Olivine-Spinel Transition in Fayalite by In Situ Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction at High Pressure and Temperature] ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'', 86, pp. 4072–4075.&lt;/ref&gt; The new transformation mechanism has been christened a pseudomartensitic transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Leutwyler [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000E8826-A6AF-1C5E-B882809EC588ED9F New phase transition] ''Scientific American'', May 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[materials science]], '''dispersion''' is the fraction of atoms of a material exposed to the surface.  In general:

:''D'' = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;/''N''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;

where ''D'' is the dispersion, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of surface atoms and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of atoms of the material.  Dispersion is an important concept in heterogeneous [[catalysis]], since only atoms that are exposed to the surface are able to play a role in catalytic surface reactions. Dispersion increases with decreasing crystallite size and approaches unity at a crystallite diameter of about 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm.

'''Feed-in electricity tariffs''' ('''FiT''') were introduced in Germany to encourage the use of new energy technologies such as [[wind power]], [[biomass]], [[hydropower]], [[geothermal power]] and [[solar photovoltaics]]. Feed-in tariffs are a policy mechanism designed to accelerate investment in [[renewable energy]] technologies by providing them remuneration (a "tariff") above the retail or wholesale rates of electricity. The mechanism provides long-term security to renewable energy producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each technology.&lt;ref&gt;Policymaker's Guide to Feed-in Tariff Policies, U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab, www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/44849.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies such as wind power, for instance, are awarded a lower per-kWh price, while technologies such as [[solar PV]] and [[tidal power]] are offered a higher price, reflecting higher costs.

As of July 2014, feed-in tariffs range from 3.33 ¢/kWh (4.4 ¢/kWh) for hydropower facilities over 50 MW to 12.88 ¢/kWh (17.3 ¢/kWh) for solar installations on buildings up to 30{{nbsp}}kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and 19 ¢/kWh (25.5 ¢/kWh) for offshore wind.&lt;ref&gt;German Energy Blog  [http://www.germanenergyblog.de/?page_id=16376 ''German Feed-in Tariffs 2014 (01-07)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2014, a revised [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] or EEG (2014) (colloquially called EEG{{nbsp}}2.0) entered into force.  The government will now stipulate specific deployment corridors to control the uptake of renewables and the feed-in tariffs themselves will be determined by auction.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015"&gt;

The aim is to meet Germany's [[renewable energy]] goals of 40 to 45% of electricity consumption in 2025 and 55% to 60% in 2035.  The policy also aims to encourage the development of renewable technologies, reduce external costs, and increase security of energy supply.&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024003134/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm |date=October 24, 2007 }} p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of 2014, 28.5% of gross electricity production in Germany came from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;German Energy Blog  [http://www.germanenergyblog.de/?page_id=16368 ''BDEW: Renewables Account for Record 28.5% of Gross German Electricity Consumption in First Half of 2014''], BDEW, [http://www.bdew.de/internet.nsf/id/20140729-pi-erneuerbare-energien-erreichen-neuen-rekordwert-de] ''Erneuerbare Energien erreichen neuen Rekordwert''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federal Environment Ministry estimated that renewables were to save 87 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2012. The average level of feed-in tariff was 9.53 ¢/kWh in 2005 (compared to an average cost of displaced energy of 4.7 ¢/kWh).  In 2004, the total level of reallocated EEG surcharges was €2.4 billion, at a cost per consumer of 0.56 ¢/kWh (3% of household electricity costs).&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; By 2013, the figure had risen to €20.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;German Energy Blog  [http://www.germanenergyblog.de/?p=15053 Some More Figures on German EEG Renewables Generation, Revenues, Surcharge, Payments, and the Special Equalisation Scheme ]&lt;/ref&gt; The tariffs are lowered every year to encourage more efficient production of renewable energy. By 2014, the EEG surcharge – which pays for the additional costs through feed-in tariffs – had increased to 6.24 ¢/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;German Energy Blog [http://www.germanenergyblog.de/?p=14559 German Renewables Surcharge Increases by 19% to 6.24 ¢/kWh in 2014 ]&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2014, the regular reductions (degressions) were 1.5% per year for electricity from onshore wind and 1% per month for electricity from photovoltaics.

The solar sector employed about 56,000 people in 2013, a strong decline from previous years, due to many insolvencies and business closures. 
Although most of the installed solar panels are nowadays imported from China, the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|Fraunhofer institute]] estimates, that only about 30% of the EEG apportionment outflows to China, while the rest is still spent domestically. The institute also predicts that Germany's solar manufacturing sector will improve its competitive situation in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/veroeffentlichungen/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien/studien-und-konzeptpapiere/aktuelle-fakten-zur-photovoltaik-in-deutschland.pdf Facts about solar PV (in German), pages 29-30 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progression of solar PV FiTs before 2012 ==

The feed-in tariff system has been modified frequently. The feed-in tariff, in force since 1 August 2004, was modified in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarwirtschaft.de/fileadmin/content_files/EEG2009_Zusammenfass.pdf EEG 2009 modifications] Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft. 2 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the unexpectedly high growth rates, the depreciation was accelerated and a new category (&gt;1000&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was created with a lower tariff. The facade premium was abolished. In July 2010, the Renewable Energy Sources Act was again amended to reduce the tariffs by a further 16% in addition to the normal annual depreciation, as the prices for PV panels had dropped sharply in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.solarwirtschaft.de/fileadmin/content_files/eeg_changes_10.pdf EEG 2010 modifications] Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft. 2 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another modification of the EEG occurred in 2011, when part of the degression foreseen for 2012 was brought forward to mid-2011 as a response to unexpectedly high installations in the course of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.solarwirtschaft.de/home/news/meldung/article/agreement-on-flexible-adjustments-to-solar-feed-in-tariff.html?tx_ttnews EEG 2011 modifications] Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft. 2 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The support duration is 20 years plus the year of project commissioning, constant remuneration.  Feed-in tariffs was lowered repeatedly (decreasing by 9% default and a maximum of 24% per year).  Degression will be accelerated or slowed down by three percentage points for every 1000&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/a divergence from the target of 3500&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/a.

== Progression of Solar PV FiTs since 2012 ==

As of July 2014, feed-in tariffs for photovoltaic systems range from 12.88 ¢/kWh for small [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|roof-top]] system, down to 8.92 ¢/kWh for large utility scaled [[Photovoltaic power station|solar parks]]. Also, FiTs are restricted to PV system with a maximum capacity of 10{{nbsp}}MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. The feed-in tariff for solar PV is declining at a faster rate than for any other renewable technology.&lt;ref name=fraunhofer-2014&gt;[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/veroeffentlichungen/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien/studien-und-konzeptpapiere/aktuelle-fakten-zur-photovoltaik-in-deutschland.pdf Facts about solar PV (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable Energy Sources Act (2014) ==

{{main article|German Renewable Energy Sources Act}}

On 1 August 2014, a revised [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] entered into force.  Specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates (feed-in tariffs) gradually will no longer be fixed by the government, but will be determined by auction.  Wind and solar power are to be targeted over hydro, gas ([[landfill gas]], sewage gas, and mine gas), geothermal, and biomass.  In late 2015, this new scheme is being tested, as a pilot project, for ground-mounted PV installations.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015"/&gt; With the Renewable Energy Sources Act (2017), auctions will become commonplace for new installations also for most other types of renewables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1030">'''Glenbrook Power Station''' is a 112MW co-generation plant located at [[Glenbrook, New Zealand|Glenbrook]], south of [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. Fully integrated into the New Zealand [[Steel plant]], and enables [[New Zealand Steel]] to optimise its [[energy]] costs. Surplus [[natural gas]] from the [[iron-making]] direct reduction [[kilns]] are used to generate [[electricity]]. Since this partnership reduces the energy consumed in the New Zealand Energy Market (NZEM) – and potentially generated from fossil-fuel burning power stations – it also reduces [[carbon emissions]].

Two cogeneration plants commissioned in 1987 and 1997.

The '''Andeavor Martinez Refinery''' [[oil refinery|refines oil]] into gasoline and other petroleum based products. It is located in the San Francisco Bay Area in an unincorporated area known as [[Avon, Contra Costa County, California|Avon]], east of [[Martinez, California]]. The refinery is owned by [[Andeavor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andeavor.com/refining/martinez/ About Martinez Refinery]. Accessed 10-11-2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The refinery is located on 2,200 acres, has approximately 650 full-time employees, and has a crude oil capacity of 166,000 barrels per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tesoro Golden Eagle Fact Sheet|url=https://tsocorpsite.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/tesoro-martinez-fact-sheet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the fourth largest refinery in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/End-of-the-road-for-California-s-bargain-gas-6084232.php#/0]&lt;/ref&gt;

The refinery was first built in 1913 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Oil Refinery History|url=http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/petroleum/refinery_history.html|publisher=California Energy Commission|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005072143/http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/petroleum/refinery_history.html|archivedate=2011-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name Avon Refinery, and has been continually expanded since. It was purchased by [[Tosco Corporation|Tosco]] in 1976. By the 1990s, a history of poor maintenance and under-staffing gave the refinery a reputation for being a hazardous workplace. Throughout the 1990s, it led the US refining industry in the number of environmental and safety code violations. These poor conditions culminated in two catastrophic accidents. In the first, a 1997 [[hydrocracker]] explosion killed one worker. In the second of these, four workers died and a fifth was hospitalized in a 1999 [[naphtha]] explosion. A maintenance supervisor refused to shut down the unit after corroding valves failed to stop the flow of the extremely hazardous substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shock Waves From Tosco Refinery's Fatal Blast Fateful day began with a final `I love you' to wife |work=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.gcmonitor.org/article.php?id=393 |accessdate=July 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223073900/http://www.gcmonitor.org/article.php?id=393 |archivedate=February 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, the refinery had a [[Gas flare|flaring]] event, due to a simultaneous [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&amp;E]] utility power and [[Foster Wheeler]] co-generation plant failure, that produced large quantities of thick black smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=East Bay News|title=Tesoro refinery incident under investigation|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&amp;id=7784145|accessdate=6/1/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, a nationwide strike by USW represented employees resulted in the closure of the Martinez refinery, the only refinery closure resulting from the strike.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/u-refinery-strike-enters-18th-day-talks-restart-172137492--finance.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/End-of-the-road-for-California-s-bargain-gas-6084232.php#/0]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2015, thick smoke and flames could be seen rising up from the refinery. Due to the loss of a primary steam generation unit, flaring was done to release pressure. A Level 2 alert was issued to the community, recommending that they stay indoors due to smoke blowing offsite. The alert was reduced to Level 0 on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc7news.com/news/health-advisory-in-contra-costa-co-after-smoke-at-tesoro-refinery/1123754/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydraulic compressors''' are usually divided in four main groups: [[Reciprocating compressor|piston compressors]], [[Rotary vane pump|rotary vane compressors]], [[rotary screw compressor]]s and [[gear compressors]]. The piston-models are the most suitable for basic need for compressed air such as energizing small handtools or airflushing of small quarry drills. Rotary vane-models include also a cooled lubrication system, oil separator, relief valve on the air intake and automatic rotation speed valve. Rotary vane-models are the most suitable for installation on different excavators, mining and other machines.

It is an [[organic compound]] part of the thiocyanates as it contains the [[functional group]] SCN. It is formed when an oxygen is singly bonded to the [[thiocyanate]] group. Hypothiocyanous acid is a fairly weak acid; its [[acid dissociation constant]] (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) is 5.3.

Hypothiocyanite is formed by peroxidase&lt;ref name="pmid16288970"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furtmüller PG, Zederbauer M, Jantschko W, Helm J, Bogner M, Jakopitsch C, Obinger C | title = Active site structure and catalytic mechanisms of human peroxidases | journal = Arch.

Dent. Res. | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 1062–6 |date=October 1983 | pmid = 6578235 | doi = 10.1177/00220345830620101101| url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanism of action ===

Lactoperoxidase-catalysed reactions yield short-lived intermediary oxidation products of SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, providing antibacterial activity.&lt;ref name="pmid7066307"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pruitt KM, Tenovuo J, Andrews RW, McKane T | title = Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate: polarographic study of the oxidation products | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 562–7 |date=February 1982 | pmid = 7066307 | doi = 10.1021/bi00532a023| url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major intermediary oxidation product is hypothiocyanite OSCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is produced in an amount of about 1&amp;nbsp;mole per mole of hydrogen peroxide. At the pH optimum of 5.3, the OSCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is in equilibrium with HOSCN. The uncharged HOSCN is considered to be the greater bactericidal of the two forms.&lt;ref name="Thomas_1983"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas EL, Pera KA, Smith KW, Chwang AK | title = Inhibition of Streptococcus mutans by the lactoperoxidase antimicrobial system | journal = Infect. Immun. | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 767–78 |date=February 1983 | pmid = 6832819 | pmc = 348016 | doi = | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At pH 7, it was evaluated that HOSCN represents 2% compare to OSCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; 98%.&lt;ref name="Thomas_1981"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas EL | title = Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate: equilibria between oxidized forms of thiocyanate | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 3273–80 |date=May 1981 | pmid = 7248282 | doi = 10.1021/bi00514a045| url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of OSCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; against bacteria is reported to be caused by sulfhydryl (SH) oxidation.&lt;ref name="Thomas_1978"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thomas EL, Aune TM | title = Lactoperoxidase, peroxide, thiocyanate antimicrobial system: correlation of sulfhydryl oxidation with antimicrobial action | journal = Infect. Immun. | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 456–63 |date=May 1978 | pmid = 352945 | pmc = 421877 | doi = | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oxidation of -SH groups in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane results in loss of the ability to transport glucose and also in leaking of potassium ions, amino acids and peptide.

OSCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; has also been identified as an antimicrobial agent in milk, saliva,&lt;ref name="pmid11936452"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tenovuo J | title = Clinical applications of antimicrobial host proteins lactoperoxidase, lysozyme and lactoferrin in xerostomia: efficacy and safety | journal = Oral Dis | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–9 |date=January 2002 | pmid = 11936452 | doi = 10.1034/j.1601-0825.2002.1o781.x| url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; tears, and mucus.

OSCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is considered as a safe product as it is not mutagenic.&lt;ref name="pmid6340603"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=White WE, Pruitt KM, Mansson-Rahemtulla B | title = Peroxidase-Thiocyanate-Peroxide Antibacterial System Does Not Damage DNA | journal = Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 267–72 |date=February 1983 | pmid = 6340603 | pmc = 186035 | doi = 10.1128/aac.23.2.267| url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to cystic fibrosis ===

Initially, this particular lactoperoxidase-catalyzed compound was originally discovered while viewing the specific environment of [[cystic fibrosis]] patients' weakened respiratory immune system against bacterial infection.&lt;ref name="pmid19703552"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gattas MV, Forteza R, Fragoso MA, Fregien N, Salas P, Salathe M, Conner GE | title = OXIDATIVE EPITHELIAL HOST DEFENSE IS REGULATED BY INFECTIOUS AND INFLAMMATORY STIMULI | journal = Free Radic. Biol. Med. | volume = 47 | issue = 10 | pages = 1450–8 |date=November 2009 | pmid = 19703552 | pmc = 2767478 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.08.017 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of cystic fibrosis include an inability to secrete sufficient quantities of SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; which results in a shortage of necessary hypothiocyanite, resulting in increasing mucous viscosity, inflammation and bacterial infection in the respiratory tract.

[[Lactoferrin]] with hypothiocyanite has been granted [[orphan drug]] status by the [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]]&lt;ref name="urlwww.ema.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/human/comp/opinion/39298409en.pdf| title =Public summary of  positive opinion for orphan designation of  hypothiocyanite / lactoferrin  for the treatment of cystic fibrosis| date =2009-09-07| format =| work =Pre-authorisation Evaluation of Medicines for Human Use| publisher =European Medicines Agency| pages =| language =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100530100046/http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/human/comp/opinion/39298409en.pdf| archivedate =2010-05-30| quote =| accessdate =2010-01-23| deadurl =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]].&lt;ref name="urlwww.bioalaxia.eu"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bioalaxia.eu/content/meveol-orphan-drug-status-granted-fda-treatment-cystic-fibrosis| title =Meveol: orphan drug status granted by the FDA for the treatment of cystic fibrosis| date =2009-11-05| format =| work =| publisher =United States Food and Drug Administration| pages =| language =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091224145219/http://www.bioalaxia.eu/content/meveol-orphan-drug-status-granted-fda-treatment-cystic-fibrosis| archivedate =2009-12-24| quote =| accessdate =2010-01-23| deadurl =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally, the discovery correlated with studies exploring different methods seeking to further gain alternative antibiotics, understanding that most older antibiotics are decreasing in effectiveness against bacteria with antibiotic resistance.

OSCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is not an antibiotic, has proved efficacy on superbugs including MRSA reference strains, BCC, Mucoid PA

Schema of LPO/SCN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in human [[lung]]

[[Image:GID Landspout.jpg|thumb|right|A landspout near [[North Platte, Nebraska]] on May 22, 2004. Note the characteristic smooth, tubular shape, similar to that of a [[waterspout]].]]
A '''landspout''' is a term coined by meteorologist [[Howard B. Bluestein]] in 1985 for a kind of [[tornado]] not associated with a [[mesocyclone]].&lt;ref name ="landspout"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1175%2F1520-0434%281999%29014%3C0558%3AAHOSSI%3E2.0.CO%3B2| title = The formation of a "landspout" in a "broken-line" squall line in Oklahoma| accessdate = 27 March 2007| author = Bluestein, Howard B.| year = 1985| work = Preprints, 14th Conf. on Severe Local Storms, Indianapolis, [[American Meteorological Society]]| pages = 267–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Glossary of Meteorology'' defines a landspout as 
: "Colloquial expression describing tornadoes occurring with a parent [[cloud]] in its growth stage and with its vorticity originating in the boundary layer.
: The parent cloud does not contain a preexisting mid-level mesocyclone. The landspout was so named because it looks like "a weak [[Florida Keys]] [[waterspout]] over land."&lt;ref name="Glossary of Meteorology"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=t&amp;p=34| title = Glossary of Meteorology, Second Edition| accessdate = 27 March 2007| author = American Meteorological Society| year = 2000| website = ametsoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landspouts are a type of tornado which forms during the growth stage of a [[cumulus congestus cloud]] by stretching [[atmospheric boundary layer|boundary layer]] [[vorticity]] upward and into the [[cumulus congestus]]'s updraft. They generally are smaller and weaker than [[supercell]] tornadoes and do not form from a [[mesocyclone]] or pre-existing rotation in the cloud. Because of this, landspouts are rarely detected by [[Weather radar|Doppler weather radar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakimoto|author2=Wilson |title=Non-supercell Tornadoes|journal=Monthly Weather Review|year=1989|volume=117|pages=1113–1140|bibcode = 1989MWRv..117.1113W |doi = 10.1175/1520-0493(1989)117&lt;1113:NST&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landspouts share a strong resemblance and development process to that of [[waterspout]]s, usually taking the form of a translucent and highly [[Laminar flow|laminar]] helical tube. Landspouts are considered tornadoes since a rotating column of air is in contact with both the surface and a cumuliform cloud. Not all landspouts are visible, and many are first sighted as debris swirling at the surface before eventually filling in with condensation and dust. 

Landspouts are often mistaken for [[Dust devil|dust devils]] and [[Gustnado|gustnadoes]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A few landspouts can persist in excess of 15 minutes and have produced [[Fujita scale|F3]] damage;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forbes|author2=Wakimoto |journal=Monthly Weather Review|title=A Concentrated Outbreak of Tornadoes, Downbursts and Microbursts, and Implications Regarding Vortex Classification|year=1983|volume=111|pages=220–235|bibcode = 1983MWRv..111..220F |doi = 10.1175/1520-0493(1983)111&lt;0220:ACOOTD&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they are most commonly weak, with winds under 85 miles per hour (138 km/h) and causing little damage.&lt;ref name="NWS-LandspoutSummary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/grr/summary20170630|title=EF-0 Landspout Tornado near Grand Junction, MI, on June 30, 2017|last=National Weather Service|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Z. |volume=11 |year=1910 |pages=609–612}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a simple measure of thermally driven [[Entropy|disorder]] in atoms or molecules. The local Lindemann index is defined as:&lt;ref name="Zhang2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang K, Stocks GM, Zhong J |title=Melting and premelting of carbon nanotubes |journal=Nanotechnology |volume=18 |issue=285703 |year=2007 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/18/28/285703 |pages=285703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

q_i = \frac{1}{N - 1} \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{\sqrt{\langle r_{ij}^2\rangle - \langle r_{ij} \rangle^2  }}{\langle r_{ij} \rangle}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where angle brackets indicate a time average. The global Lindemann index is a system average of this quantity.

;In [[condensed matter physics]] : a departure from [[linearity]] in the behaviour of the global Lindemann index or an increase above a threshold value related to the  spacing between [[atom]]s (or [[micelle]]s, particles, globules, etc.) is often taken as the indication that a solid-liquid [[phase transition]] has taken place. See [[Lindemann melting criterion]].

;[[Biomolecule]]s : often possess separate regions with different order characteristics. In order to quantify or illustrate local disorder, the local Lindemann index can be used.&lt;ref name="Rueda2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rueda M, Ferrer-Costa C, Meyer T, Perez A, Camps J, Hospital A, Gelpi JL, Orozco M |title=A consensus view of protein dynamics |journal=PNAS |date=2007-01-16|volume=104 |pages=796–801 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0605534104 |pmid=17215349 |issue=3 |pmc=1783393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Care must be taken if the molecule possesses globally defined dynamics, such as about a hinge or pivot, because these motions will obscure the local motions which the Lindemann index is designed to quantify. An appropriate tactic in this circumstance is to sum the '''r&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''' only over a small number of neighbouring atoms to arrive at each '''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''. A further variety of such modifications to the Lindemann index are available and have different merits, e.g. for the study of [[glassy]] vs [[crystalline]] materials.&lt;ref name="Zhou2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhou Y, Karplus M, Ball KD, Berry RS |title=The distance fluctuation criterion for melting: Comparison of square-well and Morse potential models for clusters and homopolymers |journal=J.

A '''National Renewable Energy Action Plan''' ('''NREAP''') is a detailed report submitted by countries outlining commitments and initiatives to develop [[renewable energy]] that all [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] were obliged to notify to the [[European Commission]] by 30 June 2010.&lt;ref name="national-renewable-energy-action-plans"&gt;
{{cite web

 | location = Brussels, Belgium
 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/national-action-plans
 | access-date = 3 August 2016
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The plan provides a detailed road map of how the member state expects to reach its legally binding 2020 target for the share of [[renewable energy]] in their total energy consumption, as required by article 4 of the [[EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC|Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC]].  In the plan, the member state sets out sectoral targets, the technology mix they expect to use, the trajectory they will follow, and the measures and reforms they will undertake to overcome the barriers to developing renewable energy.&lt;ref name="casey-2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Each NREAP report provides details of the expected share of energy provided by renewable sources up to and including 2020.  The overall target for EU countries is to use 20% of their energy use from renewable energy sources although targets for each country vary considerably.  In addition targets are broken down further by energy use sector including transport, electricity and the heating and cooling sectors.

== National targets for renewable energy sources ==

The overall EU target for renewable energy use is 20% by the year 2020. Targets for renewable energy in each country vary from a minimum of 10% in Malta to 72% of total energy use in Iceland.

== Progress Reports in the EU ==

The European Commission evaluated the National Action Plans, assessing their completeness and credibility.  The Member States must adopt and publish, initially every five years, a report setting the indicative Member State targets for future RES-E consumption for the following ten years and showing what measures have or are to be taken to meet those targets.  {{as of|March 2012}}, ten of the member states were on track to surpass the national goal, and 12 others will meet their target. So far, only five participating member states have not met their goals.&lt;ref name="casey-2012"/&gt; Iceland and Norway have also submitted NREAP reports outlining their 2020 targets.

Countries are also obliged to submit country progress reports every two years detailing the progress they have made towards meeting their long term action plans.&lt;ref name="renewable-energy-progress-reports"&gt;

'''Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers''' ('''PMUT''') are [[MEMS]]-based [[piezoelectric]] [[ultrasonic transducer]]s. Unlike bulk piezoelectric transducers which use the thickness-mode motion of a plate of [[piezoelectric]] [[ceramic]] such as [[PZT]] or [[single-crystal]] [[PMN-PT]], PMUT are based on the flexural motion of a thin membrane coupled with a thin piezoelectric film, such as [[PVDF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trolier-McKinstry|first=Susan|author2=P.

'''Paper marbling''' is a method of aqueous surface design, which can produce patterns similar to smooth [[marble]] or other kinds of stone. The patterns are the result of color floated on either plain water or a viscous solution known as [[sizing|size]], and then carefully transferred to an absorbent surface, such as [[paper]] or fabric. Through several centuries, people have applied marbled materials to a variety of surfaces. It is often employed as a writing surface for [[calligraphy]], and especially book covers and endpapers in [[bookbinding]] and [[stationery]]. Part of its appeal is that each print is a unique [[monotype]].

== Procedure ==
[[File:Paper Marbling Tank.jpg|thumb|Oil-based inks in a tank of water being prepared for marbling.]]
There are several methods for making marbled [[paper]]s. A shallow tray is filled with water, and various kinds of ink or paint colors are carefully applied to the surface with an [[ink brush]]. Various additives or [[surfactant]] chemicals are used to help float the colors. A drop of "negative" color made of plain water with the addition of [[surfactant]] is used to drive the drop of color into a ring. The process is repeated until the surface of the water is covered with concentric rings.

The floating colors are then carefully manipulated either by blowing on them directly or through a straw, fanning the colors, or carefully using a human hair to stir the colors. In the 19th century, Tokutaro Yagi, the [[Kyoto]] master of Japanese marbling (''suminagashi''), developed a method that uses a split piece of [[bamboo]] to gently stir the colors, resulting in concentric spiral designs. A sheet of ''[[washi]]'' paper is then carefully laid onto the water surface to capture the floating design. The paper, which is often made of ''kozo'' ([[Paper Mulberry|paper mulberry]]), must be [[Sizing|unsized]] and strong enough to withstand being immersed in water without tearing.

Another method of marbling more familiar to Europeans and Americans is made on the surface of a viscous mucilage, known as ''size'' or ''sizing'' in English. This method is commonly referred to as "[[Turkey|Turkish]]" marbling and is called ''ebru'' in modern Turkish, although ethnic [[Turkic peoples]] were not the only practitioners of the art, as [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] and people of [[India]]n origin also made these papers. The term "Turkish" was most likely used as a reference to the fact that many [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] first encountered the art in [[Istanbul]].

Historic forms of marbling used both organic and inorganic pigments mixed with water for colors, and sizes were traditionally made from [[gum tragacanth]] (''[[Astragalus]]'' spp.), gum karaya, [[guar gum]], [[fenugreek]] (''Trigonella foenum-graecum''), [[fleabane]], [[linseed]], and [[psyllium]]. Since the late 19th century, a boiled extract of the [[carrageenan]]-rich alga known as Irish moss (''[[Chondrus crispus]]''), has been employed for sizing. Today, many marblers use powdered carrageenan extracted from various seaweeds. Another plant-derived [[mucilage]] is made from [[sodium alginate]]. In recent years, a synthetic size made from [[hydroxypropyl methylcellulose]], a common ingredient in instant [[wallpaper paste]], is often used as a size for floating [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]] and [[oil paint]]s.

In the size-based method, colors made from [[pigments]] are mixed with a [[surfactant]] such as [[ox gall]]. Sometimes, oil or [[turpentine]] may be added to a color, to achieve special effects. The colors are then spattered or dropped onto the size, one color after another, until there is a dense pattern of several colors. Straw from the [[broom corn]] was used to make a kind of whisk for sprinkling the paint, or [[horsehair]] to create a kind of drop-brush. Each successive layer of [[pigment]] spreads slightly less than the last, and the colors may require additional [[surfactant]] to float and uniformly expand. Once the colors are laid down, various tools and implements such as rakes, combs and styluses are often used in a series of movements to create more intricate designs.

Paper or cloth is often [[mordant]]ed beforehand with [[aluminium sulfate]] (alum) and gently laid onto the floating colors (although methods such as Turkish ''ebru'' and Japanese ''suminagashi'' do not require mordanting). The colors are thereby transferred and adhered to the surface of the paper or material. The paper or material is then carefully lifted off the size, and hung up to dry. Some marblers gently drag the paper over a rod to draw off the excess size. If necessary, excess bleeding colors and sizing can be rinsed off, and then the paper or fabric is allowed to dry. After the print is made, any color residues remaining on the size are carefully skimmed off of the surface, in order to clear it before starting a new pattern.

Contemporary marblers employ a variety of modern materials, some in place of or in combination with the more traditional ones. A wide variety of colors are used today in place of the historic pigment colors. Plastic broom straw can be used instead of broom corn, as well as bamboo sticks, plastic [[pipettes]], and eye droppers to drop the colors on the surface of the size. [[Ox gall]] is still commonly used as a [[surfactant]] for [[watercolors]] and [[gouache]], but synthetic [[surfactants]] are used in conjunction with acrylic, PVA, and oil-based paints.

This multi-volume manuscript, which contains the oldest examples of marbled paper known today, was presented to the [[Emperor Shirakawa]] on his sixtieth birthday in 1112 C.E. (Narita, 14 and Chambers, 13–16).]]

An intriguing reference which some think may be a form of marbling is found in a compilation completed in 986 CE entitled 文房四谱 (''Wen Fang Si Pu'') or "Four Treasures of the Scholar's Study" edited by the 10th century [[scholar-official]] 蘇易簡 Su Yijian (957–995 CE). This compilation contains information on inkstick, [[inkstone]], [[ink brush]], and paper in [[China]], which are collectively called the [[four treasures of the study]]. The text mentions a kind of decorative paper called 流沙箋 ''liu sha jian'' meaning “drifting-sand” or “flowing-sand notepaper" that was made in what is now the region of [[Sichuan]] (Su 4: 7a–8a).

This paper was made by dragging a piece of paper through a fermented flour paste mixed with various colors, creating a free and irregular design. A second type was made with a paste prepared from honey locust pods, mixed with [[croton oil]], and thinned with water. Presumably both black and colored inks were employed. [[Ginger]], possibly in the form of an oil or extract, was used to disperse the colors, or “scatter” them, according to the interpretation given by [[T.H. Tsien]]. The colors were said to gather together when a hair-brush was beaten over the design, as [[dandruff]] particles was applied to the design by beating a hairbrush over top. The finished designs, which were thought to resemble human figures, clouds, or flying birds, were then transferred to the surface of a sheet of paper. An example of paper decorated with floating ink has never been found in [[China]]. Whether or not the above methods employed floating colors remains to be determined (Tsien 94–5).

Su Yijian was an Imperial [[scholar-official]] and served as the chief of the [[Hanlin Academy]] from about 985–993 CE. He compiled the work from a wide variety of earlier sources, and was familiar with the subject, given his profession. Yet it is important to note that it is uncertain how personally acquainted he was with the various methods for making decorative papers that he compiled. He most likely reported information given to him, without having a full understanding of the methods used. His original source may have predated him by several centuries. Until the original sources that he quotes are more precisely determined, can it be possible to ascribe a firm date for the production of the papers mentioned by Su Yijian.

''Suminagashi'' (墨流し), which means "floating ink" in Japanese, is a Japanese variant; the oldest example appears in the 12th-century [[Nishi Honganji Sanju-rokunin Kashu|Sanjuurokuninshuu]] (三十六人集), located in Nishihonganji (西本願寺), Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/suminagashi.htm |title=suminagashi　墨流し |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Einen Miura states that the oldest reference to ''suminagashi'' papers are in the waka poems of Shigeharu, (825–880 CE), a son of the famed Heian era poet [[Ariwara no Narihira|Narihira]] (Muira 14). Various claims have been made regarding the origins of ''suminagashi''. Some think that may have derived from an early form of ink divination. Another theory is that the process may have derived from a form of popular entertainment at the time, in which a freshly painted sumi painting was immersed into water, and the ink slowly dispersed from the paper and rose to the surface, forming curious designs.

One individual has often been claimed as the inventor of suminagashi. According to legend, Jizemon Hiroba felt he was divinely inspired to make suminagashi paper after he offered spiritual devotions at the [[Kasuga Shrine]] in [[Nara Prefecture]]. It is said that he then wandered the country looking for the best water with which to make his papers. He arrived in [[Echizen, Fukui|Echizen]], [[Fukui Prefecture]] where he found the water especially conducive to making ''suminagashi''. So he settled there, and his family carried on with the tradition to this day. The Hiroba Family claims to have made this form of marbled paper since 1151 CE for 55 generations (Narita, 14).

== History in Central Asia and the Islamic World ==
[[File:Quran 14.jpg|thumb|right|This calligraphic panel features a verse from the [[Qur'an]] (14:7), and is typical of compositions written upon marbled paper produced after the 16th century C.E. in [[Central Asia]], [[Iran]], [[India]], and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?intldl/ascsbib:@field%28DOCID+@lit%28ascs000259%29%29 |title=Qur'anic verse (14:7) on blue and white marble paper |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 15th century the method of floating colors on the surface of [[mucilaginous]] [[sizing]] is thought to have emerged in [[Central Asia]].  It is believed to have appeared during the end of the [[Islamic]] [[Timurid Dynasty]], whose final capital was in the city of [[Herat]], located in [[Afghanistan]] today.  Other sources suggest it emerged during the subsequent [[Shaybanid]] dynasty, in the cities of [[Samarqand]] or [[Bukhara]], in what is now modern [[Uzbekistan]].  Whether or not this method was somehow related to earlier [[China|Chinese]] or [[Japan]]ese methods mentioned above has never been concretely proven.

This [[Iran]]ian method came to be known as '' kâghaz-e abrî'' (كاغذ ابرى), although often the simplified form of ''abrî'' (ابرى), is also found in several historic texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=130&amp;avaid=742|title=ابری.» دائرة المعارف بزرگ اسلامی»|accessdate=30 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015233/http://cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=130&amp;avaid=742|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was translated by the late scholar Dr. [[Annemarie Schimmel]] to mean "clouded paper" in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Certain [[Turkey|Turkish]] writers have suggested that the word may be of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] origin related to the word ''abreh'' ابره meaning "colorful" or "variegated", though this specific term has never been concretely proven to have been used in relation to the art.  It may have been the case that both [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]  meanings were simultaneously understood by artisans, many of which were conversant in both languages at that time, and even enjoyed as an expression of poetic nuance. Most historical [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]  texts known that refer to this kind of paper use
the word ''abrî'' alone.  Today in [[Iran]] it is often called ''abr-o-bâd'' (ابرو باد), meaning "cloud and wind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestart4u.parsiblog.com/558989.htm |title=Parsiblog |accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art developed in [[Safavid]] [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]], as well as [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and the [[Deccan Sultanates]] in [[India]].  Within these regions, various methods emerged in which colors were made to float on the surface of a bath of viscous liquid mucilage or ''size'', made from various plants.  These include ''katheera'' or ''kitre''- [[gum tragacanth]] (''[[Astragalus]]'' often used as a binder by apothecaries in making tablets), ''shambalîleh'' or ''methi''- [[fenugreek]] seed (an ingredient in curry mixtures),  and ''sahlab'' or ''[[salep]]'' (the roots of "[[Orchis mascula]]", which is commonly used to make a popular beverage).  A method of manipulating colors evolved that employed various tools including rakes, combs, and other apparatus, utilized in a series of movements, resulted in incredibly elaborate, intricate, and mesmerizing designs.  In India, the ''abri'' technique was eventually combined with '''aks'', which are various methods of resist or stencils, to create unique and very rare form of [[Ottoman miniature|miniature painting]].  These are commonly associated with the Deccan region today, and especially the city of [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]] in particular, under [[Adil Shahi]] dynasty patronage in the 17th century. The topic of marbling in [[India]] is understudied and conclusive determinations have yet to be made, especially in light of discoveries made in the last 20 years.

In [[Turkey]], the art is widely known as ''ebru'' today, and continues to be very popular.  The usage of this term appears in the late 19th century. The earliest examples of Ottoman Ebru are thought to be a copy of the ''Hâlnâmah'' حالنامه by the poet Arifi, popularly known as the ''Guy-i Çevgan'' or "Ball and Polo-stick".  The text of this manuscript was rendered in a delicate cut paper découpage calligraphy by Mehmed bin Gazanfer and completed in 1540, and features many marbled and decorative paper borders.  One early master by the name of Shebek is mention posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the art known as the ''Tertib-i Risâle-i Ebrî'' (ترطیبِ رسالۀ ابری), which is dated based on internal evidence to after 1615.  Several recipes in the text are accredited to this master.  Another famous 18th-century master by the name of Hatip
Mehmed Effendi (died 1773) is accredited with developing motif and perhaps early floral designs, although evidence from India appears to contradict some of these claims.  Despite this, marbled motifs are commonly referred to as "Hatip" designs today in Turkey.

The current Turkish tradition of ebru dates to the mid 19th century, with a series of masters associated with a branch of the [[Naqshbandi]] Sufi order based at what is known as the Özbekler Tekkesi, located in [[Sultantepe, Istanbul|Sultantepe]], near [[Üsküdar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebrusanati.com/ozhistory.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129234816/http://www.ebrusanati.com/ozhistory.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 November 2007 |title=Art of Ebrû |accessdate=30 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founder of this line is accredited to Sadık Effendi (died 1846).  It is said that he learned the art in Bukhara and taught it to his sons Edhem and Salıh.  Based upon this, many Turkish marblers have stated that the art was perpetuated by Sufis for centuries, although evidence for this claim has never been concretely established. "Hezarfen" Edhem Effendi (died 1904) is attributed with developing the art as a kind of cottage industry for the tekke, to supply Istanbul's burgeoning printing industry with the decorative paper. It is said that the papers were tied into bundles and sold by weight.  Many of these papers were of the ''neftli'' design, made with turpentine, an equivalent to what is called ''stormont'' in English.

The premier student of Edhem Effendi was Necmeddin Okyay (1885–1976).  He was the first to teach the art at the Fine Arts Academy in Istanbul.  He is famous for the development of floral styles of marbling, in addition to ''yazılı ebru'' a method of writing traditional calligraphy using a gum-resist method in conjunction with ebru.  Okyay's premier student was Mustafa Düzgünman (1920–1990), the teacher of many contemporary marblers in Turkey today.  He is known for codifying the traditional repertoire of patterns, to which he only added a floral daisy design, in the manner of his teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebrusanati.com/ebrumasters.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129234735/http://www.ebrusanati.com/ebrumasters.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 November 2007 |title=Ebru Masters |accessdate=30 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History in Europe ==

In the 17th century [[European ethnic groups|European]] travelers to the [[Middle East]] collected examples of these papers and bound them into ''alba amicorum'', which literally means "books of friendship" in Latin, and is a forerunner of the modern [[autograph]] album.  Eventually the technique for making the papers reached [[Europe]], where they became a popular covering material not only for book covers and end-papers, but also for lining chests, drawers, and bookshelves. The marbling of the edges of books was also a European adaptation of the art.

The methods of marbling attracted the curiosity of early scientists during the [[Renaissance]]. While the earliest published account was written in German by [[Daniel Schwenter]], it wasn't published in his ''Delicæ Physico-Mathematicæ'' until 1671 (Wolfe, 16).  A brief description of the art by [[Athanasius Kircher]], published in ''Ars Magna Lucis et Umbræ'' in Rome in 1646, rapidly spread throughout Europe. (ibid) A thorough overview of the art with illustrations of marblers at work, and images of the tools of the trade was published in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marbreur de papier|url=http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.21:65.encyclopedie0311.635722|work=Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, etc., eds.

The art became a popular handicraft in the 19th century after the [[England|English]] maker [[Charles Woolnough]] published his ''The Art of Marbling'' (1853).  In it, he describes how he adapted a method of marbling onto book-cloth, which he exhibited at the [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]] in 1851. (Wolfe, 79)  Further developments in the art were made by Josef Halfer, a bookbinder of German origin, who lived in [[Budakeszi]], in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budakeszi-wudigess.hu/geschichte |title=Die Vergangenheit von Budakeszi |accessdate=23 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316105949/http://www.budakeszi-wudigess.hu/geschichte |archive-date=16 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Halfer discovered a method for preserving [[carrageenan]], and his methods superseded earlier ones in Europe and the US.

== In the 21st century ==
[[File:Body Marbled Hand - 1.jpg|thumb|A traditional technique [[Body marbling|adapted]] to a changed world]]
{{further|Body marbling}}

Marbled paper is still made today, and the method is now applied to fabric and three-dimensional surfaces, as well as paper. Aside from continued traditional applications, artists now explore using the method as a kind of painting technique, and as an element in [[collage]].  In the last two decades, marbling has been the subject of international symposia and museum exhibitions.  The first International Marblers' Gathering was held in Santa Fe NM in 1989 sponsored by the marbling journal Ink &amp; Gall. Active international groups can be found on social media networks such as Facebook and Yahoo! Groups, as well as sites like the International Marbling Network.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Marbling has been adapted for [[body marbling|temporary decoration of hands and faces]] for events such as festivals. Neon or ultraviolet reactive colours are typically used, and the paint is water-based and non-toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valenti|first1=Lauren|title=The New "Body Marbling" Trend Is Must-See Stuff, People|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a22529/body-marbling-trend/|publisher=Marie Claire|date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Scott, Ellen |title=Body Marbling Is the New Festival Trend You're Going to Be Obsessed with |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/09/body-marbling-is-the-new-festival-trend-youre-going-to-be-obsessed-with-6119406/ |work=Metro |date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1394">'''E. Paul Palmer''' (1926-2011) is a retired [[Brigham Young University]] physicist who specialized in geophysics. He coined the term "[[cold fusion]]".  However he was an early critic of [[Martin Fleischmann|Fleischmann]] and [[Stanley Pons|Pons]]'s claims to have developed a useful method of cold fusion.

Palmer served in the US Navy during World War II. He later served as an LDS Missionary in the East Central States Mission (primarily Tennessee and Kentucky). He received his bachelor's degree in physics from the [[University of Utah]].

In chemistry, a '''phosphide''' is a compound containing the P&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ion or its equivalent.  Many different phosphides are known, with widely differing structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most commonly encountered on the binary phosphides, i.e. those materials consisting only of phosphorus and a less electronegative element.  Numerous are polyphosphides, which are solids consisting of anionic chains or clusters of phosphorus.  Phosphides are known with the majority of less electronegative elements with the exception of [[mercury (element)|Hg]], [[lead|Pb]], [[antimony|Sb]], [[bismuth|Bi]], [[tellurium|Te]], and [[polonium|Po]].&lt;ref name = "Schnering"&gt;Von Schnering, H.G. and Hönle , W. (1994) "Phosphides - Solid-state Chemistry" in ''Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry''. R. Bruce King (ed.). John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, some phosphides are molecular.

==Binary monophosphides==
Examples of group 1 include {{chem|link=sodium phosphide|Na|3|P}}. Notable examples include [[aluminium phosphide]] , [[zinc phosphide]] , [[calcium phosphide]] exploiting their tendency to release toxic [[phosphine]] upon hydrolysis. Magnesium phosphide (Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) also is moisture sensitive. [[Indium phosphide]] (InP) and [[gallium phosphide|GaP]]  are used as a semi-conductors, often in combination of related [[arsenide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b304084b| title = Chemical vapour deposition of group Vb metal phosphide thin films| journal = Journal of Materials Chemistry| volume = 13| issue = 8| pages = 1930| year = 2003| last1 = Blackman | first1 = C.

These species are insoluble in all solvents - they are 3-dimensional solid state polymers.  For those with electropositive metals, the materials hydrolyze:
:Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   3 Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
[[File:Improved CuCoordSphereCu3P.tif|thumb|160px|Coordination environment around Cu in Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P.  Two pairs of Cu atoms are eclipsed.]]

==Polyphosphides==
'''Polyphosphides''' contain P-P bonds. The simplest polyphosphides contain {{chem|P|2|4-}} ions;.  Others contain the cluster {{chem|P|11|3-}} ions and polymeric chain anions (e.g. the helical {{chem|(|P|-|)|''n''}} ion) and complex sheet or 3-D anions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03086648708080608| title = Phosphides and Polyphosphides of the Transition Metals| journal = Phosphorus and Sulfur and the Related Elements| volume = 30| pages = 413| year = 1987| last1 = Jeitschko | first1 = W. | last2 = Möller | first2 = M. H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of structures is extensive.  [[Potassium]] has nine phosphides: K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P, K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, KP, K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, KP&lt;sub&gt;10.3&lt;/sub&gt;, KP&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;.  Eight mono- and polyphosphides of [[nickel]] also exist: (Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P, Ni&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Ni&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P, Ni&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NiP, NiP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NiP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name = "Schnering"/&gt;

Two polyphosphide ions, {{chem|P|3|4-}} found in {{chem|K|4|P|3}} and {{chem|P|4|5-}} found in K&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are [[radical anion]]s with an odd number of [[valence electron]]s making both compounds [[paramagnetic]].&lt;ref name = "Schnering"/&gt;

==Preparation of phosphide and polyphosphide materials==
There are many ways to prepare phosphide compounds. One common way involves heating a metal and [[red phosphorus]] (P) under inert atmospheric conditions or vacuum. In principle, all metal phosphides and polyphosphides can be synthesized from elemental phosphorus and the respective metal element in stoichiometric forms. However, the synthesis is complicated due to several problems. The [[exothermic reaction]]s are often explosive due to local overheating. Oxidized metals, or even just an oxidized layer on the exterior of the metal, causes extreme and unacceptably high temperatures for beginning phosphorination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = von Schnering, Hans-Georg | author2 = Hönle, Wolfgang | title = Bridging Chasms with Phosphides | journal = Chem. Rev. | year = 1988 | volume = 88 | pages = 243–273 | doi = 10.1021/cr00083a012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrothermal reactions to generate nickel phosphides have produced pure and well crystallized nickel phosphide compounds, Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P and Ni&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. These compounds were synthesized through a solid-liquid reaction between NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;∙12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and red phosphorus at 200&amp;nbsp;°C for 24 and 48 hours, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Liu, Zongyi | author2 = Huang, Xiang | author3 = Zhu, Zhibin | author4 = Dai, Jinhui | title = A simple mild hydrothermal route for the synthesis of nickel phosphide powders | journal = Ceramics International | volume = 36 | year = 2010 | pages = 1155–1158 | doi = 10.1016/j.ceramint.2009.12.015 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal phosphides are also produced by reaction of [[tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphine]] with metal halides.  In this method, the halide is liberated as the volatile [[trimethylsilyl chloride]].

[[File:MoP NR2 3.svg|thumb|Structure of terminal phosphido complexes of Mo.]] A method for the preparation of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; from red phosphorus and [[potassium ethoxide]] has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;''Facile Conversion of Red Phosphorus into Soluble Polyphosphide Anions by Reaction with Potassium Ethoxide'' A. Dragulescu-Andrasi, L. Z. Miller, B. Chen, D. T. McQuade, M. Shatruk, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2016, 55, 3904.{{doi|10.1002/anie.201511186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular phosphides==
Compounds with triple bonds between a metal and phosphorus are rare.  The main examples have the formula Mo(P)(NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where R is a bulky organic substituent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr9003709| pmid = 20175534| title = Early-Transition-Metal-Mediated Activation and Transformation of White Phosphorus| journal = Chemical Reviews| volume = 110| issue = 7| pages = 4164| year = 2010| last1 = Cossairt | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Piro | first2 = N. A. | last3 = Cummins | first3 = C. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organic phosphides==
Many organophosphides are known.  Common examples have the formular R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PM where R is an organic substituent and M is a metal.  One example is [[lithium diphenylphosphide]]. The [[Zintl cluster]] {{chem|P|7|3-}} is obtained with diverse alkali metal derivatives.

==Natural examples==
The mineral [[Schreibersite]] (Fe,Ni)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P is common in some meteorites.

'''Phosphirenium ions''' ({{chem|R|1|R|2|C|2|PY|1|Y|2|+}}) are a series of [[organophosphorus compound]]s containing unsaturated three-membered ring phosphorus(V) [[Heterocyclic compound|heterocycle]]s and [[σ*-aromaticity]] is believed to be present in such molecules. Many of the salts containing phosphirenium ions have been isolated and characterized by [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] and [[X-ray crystallography]].

== Synthesis ==
The first series of phosphirenium ions were synthesized by reacting alkynes with methyl- or phenylphosphonous dichloride and aluminum trichloride.  These reactions may be regarded as formal addition of "RClP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;" to alkynes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fongers|first=K.

Phosphirenium ions can also be obtained from reaction between phosphiranes and alkynes, where "RClP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;" is formally transferred from alkenes to alkynes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unoh|first=Yuto|last2=Hirano|first2=Koji|last3=Miura|first3=Masahiro|date=2017-05-03|title=Metal-Free Electrophilic Phosphination/Cyclization of Alkynes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b02977|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=139|issue=17|pages=6106–6109|doi=10.1021/jacs.7b02977|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:React3.pdf|center|frameless|253x253px]]

== Characterizations ==
In the literature, [[31P NMR spectroscopy|&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P NMR]] spectra of phosphirenium ions show upfield shifts (−57.3&amp;nbsp;ppm when R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = Cl). Large coupling constants ''J'' are also found in [[Proton NMR|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR]], and are comparable to those found in [[cyclopropenium ion]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first phosphirenium ion characterized by X-ray Crystallography has the following structural formula:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vural|first=J.

[[File:Structurephoscrys.pdf|center|frameless|106x106px]]
In the refined crystal structure, average phosphorus–cyclic carbon distance has been found to be 1.731(12)&amp;nbsp;Å, roughly corresponding to a bond order of 1.5. For comparison, typical single- and double-bond P–C distances are 1.86&amp;nbsp;Å and 1.68&amp;nbsp;Å, respectively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pyykkö|first=Pekka|last2=Atsumi|first2=Michiko|date=2009-01-01|title=Molecular Single-Bond Covalent Radii for Elements 1–118|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/chem.200800987/abstract|journal=Chemistry – A European Journal|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=186–197|doi=10.1002/chem.200800987|issn=1521-3765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactivity ==
Reminiscent of [[π-ligand exchange]] in [[Coordination complex|coordination compounds]], a phosphirenium ion may undergo alkyne exchange with other alkynes to give a mixture of phospinirenium species in equilibrium. Kinetically, elimination of alkyne from the cation is suggested to be [[rate-determining step]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brasch|first=Nicola E.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Ian G.|last3=Krenske|first3=Elizabeth H.|last4=Wild|first4=S.

[[File:Reactions1.pdf|center|frameless|337x337px]]

In addition, the three-membered ring of phosphirenium ion may be broken. Successive reactions with suitable nucleophile are able to proceed on the electrophilic phosphorus atom.

Electrophilic B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; readily reacts with phosphinylalkynes at room temperature to give phosphirenium-borate [[zwitterion]]s as intermediates, which then generate carbon-phosphorus σ bond activation products at higher temperature. The products are of interest to material science. Dotted line in product indicates week interaction between boron and phosphor atoms (see [[frustrated Lewis pair]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekkert|first=Olga|last2=Kehr|first2=Gerald|last3=Fröhlich|first3=Roland|last4=Erker|first4=Gerhard|date=2011-09-06|title=Phosphirenium-borate zwitterion: formation in the 1,1-carboboration reaction of phosphinylalkynes|url=http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c1cc13008k|journal=Chemical Communications|language=en|volume=47|issue=37|doi=10.1039/c1cc13008k|issn=1364-548X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== σ*-Aromaticity ==
Qualitative [[Molecular orbital diagram|molecular orbital]] (MO) diagram of a phophirenium ion can be obtained by linear combination of orbitals from a {{chem|PY|2|+}} fragment and a bent RC=CR fragment.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Göller|first=Andreas|last2=Heydt|first2=Heinrich|last3=Clark|first3=Timothy|date=1996-01-01|title=σ*-Aromaticity of Substituted 1H-Phosphirenium Cations and Substituted Silacyclopropenes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jo960387h|journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry|volume=61|issue=17|pages=5840–5846|doi=10.1021/jo960387h|issn=0022-3263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Priyakumari|first=Chakkingal P.|last2=Jemmis|first2=Eluvathingal D.|date=2013-10-30|title={{chem|P|3|F|9|2–}}: An All-Pseudo-π* 2π-Aromatic|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja408308g|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=135|issue=43|pages=16026–16029|doi=10.1021/ja408308g|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low-lying σ* orbital from the former with ungerade symmetry interacts with both π and π* orbitals of the latter, creating a [[Huckel rule|2π-Hückel system]], analogous to the one in cyclopropenium ion. This effect has been named as σ*-aromaticity. It is noteworthy that unlike the case of cyclopropenium ion, interaction between the filled σ orbital of the {{chem|PY|2|+}} fragment and π orbitals also leads to some degree of antiaromatic character. Therefore, net 3-center conjugative effect is a combination of both σ* stabilizing contribution and σ destabilizing contribution.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Electronegativity]] of each substituent on phosphorus plays a role as more electron-donating ones give greater degrees of antiaromatic sigma destabilization. This has been confirmed by [[Natural Population Analysis]] (NPA), where the energy changes of the reactions below were calculated with interactions between the C–C double bond and phosphorus both turned on and off by manipulating [[Fock matrix|Fock matrix elements]]: 
[[File:Sigmaaromaticity.pdf|center|frameless|315x315px]]
[[File:Nboanalysisphosphirenium.pdf|thumb|400x400px|Major Lewis structures of {{chem|H|2|C|2|PF|2|+}} from NBO analysis.]]
Destabilization energies were the differences between corresponding reactions:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
*Destabilization energy = energy (1) − energy (2)
*Destabilization Energy with different Y groups: Y = F &gt; OH &gt; Cl &gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; Br &gt; I &gt; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; H
This series is in accordance with the trend of electronegativity of the ligand atoms.

[[Natural bond orbital]] (NBO) analysis provides possible [[Lewis structure]]s of a molecule and has been carried out to assess the structure of {{chem|H|2|C|2|PF|2|+}}. Similar to the aromatic cyclopropenium ion, the phosphorus analog shows a resonance between the structure with carbon-carbon double bond ('''1''', 72.02%) and the ones with carbon-phosphorus double bond ('''3a''' and '''3b''', 7.88% combined). In addition, the ring-opening forms '''2a''' and '''2b''' combined also occupy 9.08% weight.

{{Star formation}}
A '''protostar''' is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent [[molecular cloud]]. The protostellar phase is the earliest one in the process of [[stellar evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Formation of Stars|author1=Stahler, S. W.  |author2=Palla, F. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = [[Wiley-VCH]]|year = 2004|isbn = 3-527-40559-3|location = Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a one solar-mass star it lasts about 1,000,000 years. The phase begins when a molecular cloud first collapses under the force of self-gravity. It ends when the protostar blows back the infalling gas and is revealed as an optically visible [[pre-main-sequence star]],  which later contracts to become a [[Main Sequence Star|main sequence star]].


==History==
The modern picture of protostars, summarized above, was first suggested by [[Chushiro Hayashi]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Evolution of Protostars|last = Hayashi, C.|date = 1966|journal = Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=4 |pages=171 |doi = 10.1146/annurev.aa.04.090166.001131|bibcode = 1966ARA&amp;A...4..171H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first models, the size of protostars was greatly overestimated. Subsequent numerical calculations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Numerical Calculations of the Dynamics of a Collapsing Protostar|last = Larson, R. B.|date = 1969|journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=145 |pages=271|doi = 10.1093/mnras/145.3.271|bibcode = 1969MNRAS.145..271L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Formation of Solar-Type Stars in Spherical Symmetry: I.

This basic theoretical result has been confirmed by observations, which find that the largest pre-main-sequence stars are also of modest size.

==Protostellar evolution==

{{main article|Star formation}}
Star formation begins in relatively small [[molecular cloud]]s called dense cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dense Cores in Dark Clouds: II. NH3 Observations and Star Formation|author1=Myers, P. C.  |author2=Benson, P. J. |lastauthoramp=yes |date = 1983|journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume=266 |issue= |pages=309|doi = 10.1086/160780|bibcode = 1983ApJ...266..309M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each dense core is initially in balance between self-gravity, which tends to compress the object, and both [[Gas pressure (factors)|gas pressure]] and [[magnetic pressure]], which tend to inflate it. As the dense core accrues mass from its larger, surrounding cloud, self-gravity begins to overwhelm pressure, and collapse begins. Theoretical modeling of an idealized spherical cloud initially supported only by gas pressure indicates that the collapse process spreads from the inside toward the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Self-Similar Collapse of Isothermal Spheres and Star Formation|last = Shu, F. H.|date = 1977|journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume=214 |issue= |pages=488|doi = 10.1086/155274|bibcode = 1977ApJ...214..488S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectroscopic observations of dense cores that do not yet contain stars indicate that contraction indeed occurs. So far, however, the predicted outward spread of the collapse region has not been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = B335 - A Laboratory for Astrochemistry in a Collapsing Cloud|last = Evans, N. J., Lee, J.-E., Rawlings, J. M. C., and Choi, M.|date = 2005|journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume=626 |issue= |pages=919|doi = 10.1086/430295|arxiv = astro-ph/0503459 |bibcode = 2005ApJ...626..919E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gas that collapses toward the center of the dense core first builds up a low-mass protostar, and then a [[protoplanetary disk]] orbiting the object. As the collapse continues, an increasing amount of gas impacts the disk rather than the star, a consequence of [[angular momentum]] conservation. Exactly how material in the disk spirals inward onto the protostar is not yet understood, despite a great deal of theoretical effort. This problem is illustrative of the larger issue of [[accretion disk]] theory, which plays a role in much of astrophysics.

[[File:A diamond in the dust.jpg|thumb|[[HBC 1]] is a young [[pre-main-sequence star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A diamond in the dust|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/potw1607a/|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Regardless of the details, the outer surface of a protostar consists at least partially of shocked gas that has fallen from the inner edge of the disk. The surface is thus very different from the relatively quiescent [[photosphere]] of a [[Pre-main-sequence star|pre-main sequence]] or [[Main sequence|main-sequence]] star. Within its deep interior, the protostar has lower temperature than an ordinary star. At its center, [[hydrogen-1]] is not yet [[nuclear fusion|fusing]] with itself. Theory predicts, however, that the hydrogen isotope [[deuterium]] fuses with hydrogen-1, creating [[helium-3]]. The heat from this fusion reaction tends to inflate the protostar, and thereby helps determine the size of the youngest observed [[Pre-main-sequence star|pre-main-sequence]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deuterium and the Stellar Birthline|last = Stahler, S. W.|date = 1988|journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume=332 |issue= |pages=804|doi = 10.1086/166694|bibcode = 1988ApJ...332..804S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy generated from ordinary stars comes from the nuclear fusion occurring at their centers. Protostars also generate energy, but it comes from the radiation liberated at the shocks on its surface and on the surface of its surrounding disk. The radiation thus created must traverse the [[interstellar dust]] in the surrounding dense core. The dust absorbs all impinging photons and reradiates them at longer wavelengths. Consequently, a protostar is not detectable at optical wavelengths, and cannot be placed in the [[Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram|Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]], unlike the more evolved [[Pre-main-sequence star|pre-main-sequence]] stars.

The actual radiation emanating from a protostar is predicted to be in the [[infrared]] and millimeter regimes. Point-like sources of such long-wavelength radiation are commonly seen in regions that are obscured by [[molecular cloud]]s. It is commonly believed that those conventionally labeled as Class 0 or Class I sources are protostars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Spectral Evolution of Young Stellar Objects|last = Adams, F. C., Lada, C. J., and Shu, F. H.|date = 1987|journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume=312 |issue= |pages=788|doi = 10.1086/164924|bibcode = 1987ApJ...312..788A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Submillimeter Continuum Observations of rho Ophiuchi A: The Candidate Protostar VLA 1623 and Prestellar Clumps|last = Andre, P, Ward-Thompson, D. and Barsony, M.|date = 1993|journal = Astrophysical Journal |volume=406 |issue= |pages=122|doi = 10.1086/172425|bibcode = 1993ApJ...406..122A }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still no definitive evidence for this identification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9457">The '''QuattroVelo''' is a commercial-production [[velomobile]] which is notable for using both four wheels and also a highly aerodynamic fairing.  The QuattroVelo is manufactured by Velomobiel.nl in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velomobiel.nl/quattrovelo/|title=QuattroVelo - Intro|publisher=Velomobiel.nl|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first production models delivered in 2016.

==Features and Comparison==

Velomobiles are a class of faired cycles.  One "speed" class of velomobiles emphasizes fairing aerodynamics for high speed.  Most velomobiles in this class use three wheels, and so it is instructive to compare the four-wheel QuattroVelo against three-wheel designs.

"Speed" velomobiles (compared to "cargo" velomobiles) are limited mainly by aerodynamics and rolling drag.  Thus, "low aerodynamic drag" has long been a focus for such designs.

Three-wheel designs tend to have better aerodynamics than four-wheel designs:
* Wheels are disks, and thus not very aerodynamic compared to a teardrop or other aerodynamic shapes.
* There are significant aerodynamic losses where each wheel enters the fairing.
* A two-in-front one-in-rear "[[Tricycle#Tadpole|tadpole]]" configuration means the velomobile can be narrow in the rear and thus approximate a teardrop shape, such as a [[Kamm tail]].

Beyond aerodynamics, three wheels instead of four has other advantages:
* Three wheels weigh less than four.
* Pairs of wheels can be misaligned ([[toe in]] or [[toe out]]) so they track in slightly different directions, and thus must slip or "scrub" slightly as they roll which causes drag.  If a single wheel is misaligned it can steer the vehicle, but does not cause drag.

Three wheels have at least three significant disadvantages compared to four:
* Three-wheel cornering stability is much worse than a four-wheel vehicle of similar width.  In one comparison, the three-wheeler tips at about 70% the cornering force of the four-wheeler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waarom?|url=https://velomobiel.wordpress.com/2015/04/15/waarom/|website=velomobiel.nl blog|publisher=Velomobiel.nl|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Loss of traction of a single rear wheel, even while going straight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan has a moment|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGgHu-P7qu0|website=YouTube|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, can cause roll-over accidents, with some serious injuries reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rear tire blow out|url=http://www.bentrideronline.com/messageboard/showthread.php?p=1497454#post1497454|website=Bent Rider Online|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, whereas with a pair of wheels, one wheel can lose traction but the other still provides some direction control&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Navratilova|first1=Eva|title=quattrovelo rear tyre blowout test|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sdhjs7zbrs|website=YouTube|publisher=Velomobiel.nl|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* The centrally-located rear wheel makes it difficult to make a large luggage area.  Three wheel velomobiles have enough space for sporting use (spare clothes, a few tools), but limited for transportation/utility use (shopping, carrying tools etc. to work).

For the above reasons, most "aerodynamic"-class velomobiles have used a tadpole tricycle configuration, while most four-wheel velomobiles have been used for "transportation"- and "cargo"-class velomobiles.

==Development==

In 2009, Miles Kingsbury was racing a [[Tricycle#Tadpole|tadpole]] tricycle velomobile, and often lost to a competitor riding a [[Velomobile|streamliner]] (which Kingsbury had designed and built).  Kingsbury concluded one reason he lost to the streamliner was limited cornering stability of his tricycle.  He calculated that it was plausible to build a 4-wheel velomobile which would both have the needed stability and also have good enough aerodynamics to be competitive.  He then designed and built a 4-wheel velomobile, which he called the Quattro &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quattro|url=http://www.kingcycle.co.uk/page8.htm|publisher=Miles Kingsbury|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsbury finished just in time to ship it to the USA to participate in ROAM, a group of several dozen velomobie riders riding from coast to coast{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.  Several ROAM riders were impressed that Kingsbury in his Quattro had good cornering stability; was able to keep pace with riders with "aerodynaic"-class velomobiles; and had much larger stowage volume -- an issue of practical value for velomobiles used for everyday transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four-wheel velomobile and power assist|url=http://velomobileobserver.blogspot.com/2016/02/four-wheel-velomobile-and-power-assist.html|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led several velomobile designers to re-consider 4 wheels for aerodynamic velomobiles -- despite the inherent drag losses of 4 wheels compared to three.  Velomobiles.nl claims for a given width, four wheels offer 40% higher cornering stability than a tadpole tricycle of similar width and center of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Waarom?|url=https://velomobiel.wordpress.com/2015/04/15/waarom|publisher=Velomobiel.nl|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, a tricycle would need to be 40% wider to get the same stability; but since air drag is directly related to frontal area, making the tricycle wide would directly hurt aerodynamics.

As of 2017/05 there are several projects by various makers to introduce "aerodynamic"-class 4-wheel velomobiels; the QuattroVelo is of special interest because (as of 2017/05) tens of units are in the hands of private owners and so can be used for independent testing.

==Comparison==

The QuattroVelo may be compared against other "aerodynamic"-class velombiles.  As of 2017, some of the fastest tadpole velomobiles are the DF, Milan, and Quest.  The Quest is made by Velomobiels.nl, but the others are not.  Production of the QuattroVelo is (2017/05) tens of units, limiting the volume of independent tests, but several riders have both a QuattroVelo and another "aerodynamic"-class velomobie; and report in public forums QuattroVelo speed is nearly as fast as several "best in class" three-wheel velomobiles such as the DF and Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=quattro / Q4W - nouveau Vélomobiel à 4 Roues|url=http://velorizontal.bbfr.net/t19130p275-quattro-q4w-nouveau-velomobiel-a-4-roues|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another comparison is cargo capacity.  One practical use is commuting and/or shopping.  A tricycle with a single rear wheel typically has two small compartments, one on either side of the rear wheel.  A quadracycle can have one large stowage area between the rear wheels. A single large stowage area is often more useful, as it can hold cargo which cannot be easily divided among several small compartments.

A humorous competition demonstrated that a Quattrovelo can hold 26 six-packs of beer in glass bottles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quattrovelo luggage test, official|publisher=Bent Rider Online|accessdate=22 May 2017|url=http://www.bentrideronline.com/messageboard/showthread.php?t=133211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the competition was humorous, it demonstrates the practical stowage capacity of the Quattrovelo is both much larger than most "speed" velos, and also large enough for many daily uses.  Another use is carrying a passenger.  The Quattrovelo is offered standard with a second seat for a small (non-pedaling) rider.

Most 3-wheel velomobiles drive (power) the single rear wheel, and a four-wheel velomobile with two driven wheels may have better drive traction.  One reason is that many tricycles put about 1/3 of total weight on the drive wheel, while many quads put about 1/2 weight on the two drive wheels.  Further, the Quattrovelo uses two ratchets, one to drive each rear wheel; thus, if one drive wheel loses traction, the other one continues to drive.  Note this is different than driving via a simple [[Differential_(mechanical_device)|differential]], in which the loss of traction on one wheel causes the other wheel to stop driving.  Several Quattrovelo riders are also riders of 3-wheel velomobiles and report online the Quattrovelo has much better traction and climbing on loose or slippery surfaces{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}.  There are two- and even three-wheel drive tricycles; so improved traction is not unique to the Quattrovelo, but it may be unique among "speed"-class production velomobiles.

An alternative to "more/four wheels" is a longer and/or wider three-wheel velomobile.  A wider profile hurts aerodynamics, but smoother air-flow can compensate to a degree.  At the same time, [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|CFRP]] is stiff and strong enough that the weight penalty for "larger three-wheeler" is comparable to the added weight for a "smaller four-wheeler".  As of 2017/05, a main example of a good-aerodynamics three-wheel velomobile with large cargo capacity is the Milan 4.2 ("for two").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milan 4.2|url=http://velomobil.eu/Raderwerk|publisher=Raderwerk|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Milan 4.2 is not directly comparable to the Quattrovelo, as the 4.2 has enough stowage for an adult passenger (though no passenger drivetrain).  The weight and aerodynamics of the Milan 4.2 are thus broadly similar to the Quattrovelo; and stability depends significantly on cargo loading and weight distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4711">{{for|hydrogen peroxide monopropellant rockets sometimes loosely referred to as 'steam rockets'|Hydrogen_peroxide#Propellant}}
A '''steam rocket''' (also known as a '''hot water rocket''') is a [[thermal rocket]] that uses [[water]] held in a [[pressure vessel]] at a high temperature, such that its [[saturated vapor pressure]] is significantly greater than ambient pressure. The water is allowed to escape as [[steam]] through a [[rocket nozzle]] to produce [[thrust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tecaeromex.com/ingles/vapori.html tecaeromex- steam rockets]&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam rockets are usually [[pressure fed]], but more complex designs using [[solar thermal rocket|solar energy]] or [[nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear energy]] have been proposed.  They are probably best known for their use in rocket-powered cars and motorcycles, and they are the type used in [[aeolipile]].

==Principle of operation==
Water, while under pressure, is heated up to a high temperature (approx. 250-500 °C). As the hot water goes through the nozzle (usually a [[de Laval nozzle]]) and the pressure reduces, the water flashes to [[steam]] pressing on the nozzle, and leaving at high speed. By the recoil the rocket accelerates in the opposite direction to the steam. The nozzle of hot water rockets must be able to withstand high pressure, high temperatures and the particularly corrosive nature of hot water.

The simplest design has a pressurised water tank where the water is heated before launch, however, this gives a very low exhaust velocity since the high [[latent heat of vapourisation]] means that very little actual steam is produced and the exhaust consists mostly of water, or if high temperatures and pressures are used, then the tank is very heavy.

More complex designs can involve passing the water through pumps and heat exchangers and employing nuclear reactors or solar heating, it is estimated that these can give a [[specific impulse]] of over 195 s I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/moonicerocket/ AIAA 97-3172, "Nuclear-Heated Steam Rocket Using Lunar Ice"] [[Anthony Zuppero]]&lt;/ref&gt;, which is still well below the standards of more complex designs, for example the 465 s of the hydrogen-oxygen [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci engine]].

==Applications of steam rockets==
* An [[aeolipile]] is pushed around by steam rockets
* [[Evel Knievel]]'s [[Skycycle X-2]] used for the [[Skycycle X-2#Snake River Canyon|Snake River Canyon]] jump used a steam rocket designed by [[Robert Truax]]
* [[Art Arfons|Walt Arfons]]'s "Neptune I" dragster, also used a steam rocket designed by Robert Truax&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tecaeromex.com/ingles/vapori.html "Neptune I"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hot water rockets are used occasionally as auxiliary launch aids and for experimentation purposes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.
* On March 25, 2018 flat-Earther [[Mike_Hughes_(daredevil)| "Mad" Mike Hughes]] manned and launched his steam powered rocket to a height of 1,875 feet (572 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/flat-earther-mad-mike-hughes-rocket-launch-man-blasts-off-a8272761.html|title=Flat-earther blasts off in homemade rocket in bid to reassure himself world is shaped 'like a Frisbee'|date=25 March 2018|author=Chiara Giordano|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed uses of steam rockets==
Solar or nuclear heated steam [[thermal rocket]]s have been proposed for use in interplanetary travel. Although the performance is low, high [[Payload fraction|mass fractions]] are easy to achieve, and water is expected to be very easy to extract and purify from ice deposits that are found around the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neofuel.com/ Neofuel, using abundant off-earth resources for interplanetary transport]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stone of Tizoc''', '''Tizoc Stone''' or '''Sacrificial Stone''' is a large, round, carved [[Aztec]] stone. It is thought to have been a ''[[cuauhxicalli]]'' or possibly a ''[[temalacatl]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58468201|title=Handbook to life in the Aztec world|last=Manuel.|first=Aguilar-Moreno,|date=2006|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=0816056730|location=New York|oclc=58468201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Townsend maintains, however, that the stone was hollowed in the 16th century for unknown purposes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=Richard|year=1977|title=State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan|url=|journal=Studies in Pre-Columbian Art &amp; Archaeology|volume=|pages=46|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone was rediscovered on 17 December 1791 when construction was being done in downtown Mexico City. The workmen had been breaking up monuments that were found and using them as cobblestone. A churchman named Gamboa happened to be passing by and saved the stone from the same result. The stone was then moved to the cemetery of the nearby Cathedral where it stayed until 1824, when it was moved to the University. The stone is currently in the [[National Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/analesdelmuseona00muse|title=Anales del Museo Nacional de México|last=Museo Nacional de México|date=1877-01-01|publisher=México : El Museo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monolith is made of [[basalt]] and measures 93&amp;nbsp;cm tall with a diameter of 2.65 meters and a circumference of 8.31 meters.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/820630721|title=Escultura monumental mexica|last=Eduardo.|first=Matos Moctezuma,|date=2012|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|others=López Luján, Leonardo.|isbn=9786071609328|edition=1st|location=México, D.F.|oclc=820630721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The lateral side of the stone depicts 15 separate scenes of a repeated scene of a costumed warrior having their hair grabbed by another warrior. Presumably the first figure, the warrior with the largest headress is identified by the glyph of Tizoc and wears the headdress of the deity [[Huītzilōpōchtli|Huitzilopotchli]], the revered god of war.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In each scene the warrior being grabbed has an identifying location glyph. Each of the warriors grabbing the other are identified with the 'smoking foot' motif as well as the symbol of the smoking mirror in their headdress both icons associating them with the deity [[Texcatlipoca|Tezcatlipoca]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76819802|title=The art of Mesoamerica : from Olmec to Aztec|last=Ellen.|first=Miller, Mary|date=2006|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|isbn=050020392X|edition=  4th|location=London|oclc=76819802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the bottom of the rim are glyphs representing [[Tlaltecuhtli]] at each of the cardinal points,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in between these glyphs are rows of ''[[tecpatl]]'', sacrificial knives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Along the top of the rim are eyes and circular pieces of jade, symbols of Venus and the stars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The top of the stone has a sun diadem, with large triangles corresponding with the cardinal directions while smaller rays point in the inter-cardinal directions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The stone also features a large divot from the center to the edge of the sculpture. This divot is believed to have been done after the creation of the stone due to the rough and asymmetrical nature of the cut.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Interpretations ==
[[File:PSM V31 D091 Sacrificial stone or cuauhxicalli of tizoc.jpg|thumb|Top View of The Stone of Tizoc]]
The act of grabbing another's hair has long been recognized as a symbol of defeat or conquering in Mesoamerica, as such the stone is interpreted to represent the conquest of other locations by the Mexica.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The main interpretation is that the stone is a propaganda piece for [[Tizoc]], the [[Hueyi Tlatoani|Aztec Emperor]] from 1481 to 1486; a rather weak emperor who did little to expand the empire.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Aztec writing|Aztec glyphs]] above each conquered soldier give the name of the original site which may have already been conquered. The toponyms are written in a mixture of logographic and syllabic signs. The stone also depicts the stars at the top rim, emphasizing the heavens; while the icons at the bottom edge represent the earth. Combined with the solar iconography on the top, this associates Aztec conquering and rule with the divine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While Tizoc is the only identifiable conqueror, each subsequent Mexica warrior shares the same 'smoking foot' motif to link them together. Some historians take this to mean that Tizoc is attempting to link his only large military conquest, depicted as the first scene, to the conquests of previous rulers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fact that there are fifteen scenes could be related to the 15 lords of the 15 Mexica city-states, emphasizing the political and military divisions of the Mexica emperor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Richard Townsend argues that the relief may function as a symbolic manifestation of the Aztec empires tribute system. In relation to Mexica tradition, conquered tribes or cities were expected to send sacrificial offerings to the victor. Tizoc, head of the Aztec empire at the time, would therefore be the one collecting these tributes. The stone acts as acknowledgement of such a transaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a ''temalacatl,'' the stone may have been a used for mock battles between a group of warriors and a victim who was tied to the stone and given a feathery club while the warriors had sharp ''[[macuahuitl]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is argued however, that ''temalactal'' are often described of as being flat on the top and the central hole lacks any kind of bar with which to tie a victim.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; More likely however, the stone was used as a ''cuauhxicalli'', within the center of which the hearts of sacrificial victims were placed. It is argued that central hole likely had a face (like the [[Aztec calendar stone|Calendar Stone]]) which was later mutilated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Strähle's construction''' is a [[geometry|geometric]] method for determining the lengths for a series of [[vibrating string]]s with uniform diameters and tensions to sound [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] in a specific rational [[Musical temperament|tempered]] [[musical tuning]]. It was first published in the 1743 ''Proceedings of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]'' by Swedish master [[organ (music)|organ]] maker '''Daniel Stråhle''' (1700–1746). The Academy's secretary Jacob Faggot appended a miscalculated set of pitches to the article, and these figures were reproduced by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg]] in ''Versuch über die musikalische Temperatur'' in 1776. Several German textbooks published about 1800 reported that the mistake was first identified by Christlieb Benedikt Funk in 1779, but the construction itself appears to have received little notice until the middle of the twentieth century when tuning theorist [[J. Murray Barbour]] presented it as a good method for approximating [[equal temperament]] and similar exponentials of small roots, and generalized its underlying mathematical principles.

It has become known as a device for building fretted musical instruments through articles by mathematicians [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg]], and is praised by them as a unique and remarkably elegant solution developed by an unschooled craftsman.

The name "Strähle" used in recent English language works appears to be due to a transcription error in Marpurg's text, where the old-fashioned diacritic raised "e" was substituted for the raised ring.&lt;ref name = "marpurg"&gt;Wilhelm Friedrich Marpurg [http://www.mdz-nbn-resolving.de/urn/resolver.pl?urn=urn:nbn:de:bvb:12-bsb10598999-6 ''Versuch über die musikalische Temperatur''] 1776 p.167-168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Daniel P. Stråhle was active as an organ builder in central Sweden&lt;!--[[Gästrikland]]--&gt; in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. He had worked as a journeyman for the important Stockholm organ builder Johan Niclas Cahman&lt;!--(1675-1735)??--&gt;, and in 1741&lt;!--Norlind says 1742--&gt;, four years after Cahman's death, Stråhle was granted his privilege for organ making. According to the system in force in Sweden at the time a privilege, a granted monopoly which was held by only a few of the most established makers of each type of musical instruments, gave him the legal right to build and repair organs, as well as to train and examine workers, and it also served as a guarantee of the quality of the work and education of the maker.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Helenius-Öberg [http://www.musikforskning.se/stm/STM1977/STM1977_1HeleniusOberg.pdf "Svensk Instrumentmakeri 1720-1800 - En Preliminär Översikt"] ''Svensk Tidskrift för Musikforskning'', 1977 p.22&lt;!--5-43--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An organ by him from 1743 is preserved in its original condition at the chapel at [[Strömsholm Palace]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcourt.se/royalcourt/theroyalpalaces/stromsholmpalace/thepalace/history.4.396160511584257f21800017339.html  History: Strömsholm Palace] The Royal Palaces - The Royal Court (accessed October 14, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; he is also known to have made [[clavichord]]s, and a notable example with an unusual string scale and construction signed by him and dated 1738 is owned by the [[Stockholm Music Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Kottick and George Lucktenberg, ''Early Keyboard Instruments in European Museums'' Indiana University Press 1997 p.196&lt;br /&gt;Daniel Stråhle, 1738 [http://www.musikmuseet.se/samlingar/detalj.php?l=sv&amp;iid=172&amp;str= Klavikord, Inv. nr. N145765] - Stockholm Music Museum (accessed August 28, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; His apprentices included his nephew Petter Stråhle and Jonas Gren, partners in the famous Stockholm organ builders Gren &amp; Stråhle,&lt;ref&gt;"Jonas Gren" ''Nordisk Familjebok'' femte band, Gernandts boktryckeri-aktiebolag, Stockholm. 1882 p.1554&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Abraham Hülphers|Abraham Abrahamsson Hülphers]] in his book ''Historisk Afhandling om Musik och Instrumenter'' published in 1773, Stråhle himself had studied mechanics (which has been assumed to have included mathematics&lt;ref name = "kerala"&gt;Kerala J. Snyder ''The Organ as a Mirror of its Time: North European Reflections, 1600-2000'' Oxford University Press, 2002 p.8, 15&lt;/ref&gt;) with Swedish Academy of Science founding member [[Christopher Polhem]].&lt;ref name = "norlind"&gt;Tobias Norlind ''Svensk Musikhistoria'' Helsingborgs Typografiska Anstalt, Helsingborg 1901. p.&amp;nbsp;132&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=yyIQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=polhem+orgel&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=5AL9Sq_qD5u0zASZ4LSjDw&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=polhem%20orgel&amp;f=false--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1746 at Lövstabruk in northern Uppland.

Stråhle published his construction as a "new invention, to determine the ''Temperament'' in tuning, for the pitches of the clavichord and similar instruments" in an article that appeared in the fourth volume of the proceedings of the newly formed Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which included articles by prominent scholars and Academy members Polhem, [[Carl von Linne|Carl Linnaeus]], [[Carl Fredrik Mennander]], [[Augustin Ehrensvärd]], and [[Samuel Klingenstierna]].&lt;!--Jacob Faggot, Göran Wallerius,  and Per Elvius, Daniel Tilas, and scientific instrument maker Daniel Ekström in the same volume--&gt; According to organologist Eva Helenius musical tuning was a subject of intense debate in the Academy during the 1740s,&lt;ref name = "helenius1979"&gt;Eva Helenius-Öberg [http://www.musikforskning.se/stm/STM1979/STM1979_1HeleniusOberg.pdf "Cembalon i Sverige samt Frågan om det Svenska Klavikordets Uppkomst"] ''Svensk Tidskrift för Musikforskning'' 1979 p.31-42&lt;/ref&gt; and though Stråhle himself was not a member his was the third article on practical musical topics published by the Academy—the first two were by amateur musical instrument maker, minister, and Academy member Nils Brelin&lt;ref&gt;"Nils Brelin" ''Nordisk Familjebok'' fjärde bandet Nordisk Familjeboks förlags aktiebolag Stockholm 1905 p.86&lt;/ref&gt; which related inventions applicable to harpsichords and clavichords.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Brelin "Et Påfund at Storligen öka ''Claviers'' och ''Cymbalers'' godhet" ''Kongliga Swenska Wetenskaps Academiens Handlingar'', för Månaderne Julius, August och September 1739 vol. 1, p.81; Nils Brelin "Beskrifning öfver det nyt Påfund af en uprät-stående dubbel Clavesin, inrättad met forte och Piano til 8. graders förändring, som wid 1741. års Riksdag för Riksens Höglofl. Ständer blifwit upwist, af des inventor Nicol. Brelin ''Kongliga Swenska Wetenskaps Academiens Handlingar'', för Månaderne Julius, August och September vol.3 p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

Stråhle wrote in his article that he had developed the method with "some thought and a great number of attempts" for the purpose of creating a gauge for the lengths of the strings in the temperament which he described as that which made the tempering ("sväfningar") mildest for the ear, as well comprising as the most useful and even arrangement of the pitches. His instructions produce an irregular tuning with a range of tempered intervals similar to better known tunings published during the same period, but he provided no further comments or description about the tuning itself; today it is generally considered to be an approximation of [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbour (1951) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; He also did not elaborate upon any advantages of his construction, which can produce accurate and repeatable results without calculations or measurement with only a straightedge and dividers; he described the construction in only five steps, and it is less iterative than  arithmetic methods described by [[Dom Bédos de Celles]] method for determining organ pipe lengths in just intonation or [[Vincenzo Galilei]] for determining string fret positions in approximate equal temperament, and geometrical methods such as those described by [[Gioseffo Zarlino]] and [[Marin Mersenne]]—all of which are much better known than Stråhle's. Stråhle concluded by stating that he had applied the system to a clavichord, although the tuning as well as the method of determining a set of sounding lengths can be used for many other musical instruments, but there is little evidence showing whether it was put into more widespread practice other than the two examples described in the article, and whose whereabouts today are unknown.

== Construction ==

[[Image:1743Strahle tabvifig4.svg|300px|right]]Stråhle instructed first to draw a line segment ''QR'' of a convenient length divided in twelve equal parts, with points labeled I through XIII. ''QR'' is then used as the base of an isosceles triangle with sides ''OQ'' and ''OR'' twice as long as ''QR'', and rays drawn from vertex ''O'' through each of the numbered points on the base. Finally a line is drawn from vertex ''R'' at an angle through a point ''P'' on the opposite leg of the triangle seven units from ''Q'' to a point ''M'', located at twice the distance from ''R'' as ''P''. The length of ''MR'' gives the length of the lowest sounding pitch, and the length of ''MP'' the highest of the string lengths generated by the construction, and the sounding lengths between them are determined by the distances from ''M'' to the intersections of ''MR'' with lines ''O I'' through ''O XII'', at points labeled 1 through 12.

Stråhle wrote that he had named the line ''PR'' "Linea Musica", which Helenius noted was a term Polhem had used in an undated but earlier manuscript now located at the Linköping Stifts- och Landsbibliotek and which is accompanied by notes from composer and geometer Harald Vallerius (1646–1716) and Stråhle's former employer J. N. Cahman.&lt;ref name = "helenius1979" /&gt;

Stråhle also showed line segments parallel to ''MR'' through points ''NHS'', ''LYT'', and ''KZV'' in order to illustrate how once created the construction could be scaled to accommodate different starting pitches.

Stråhle stated at the conclusion of the article that he had implemented the string scale in the highest three octaves of a clavichord, although it is unclear whether this section would have been strung all with the same gauge wire under equal tension like the monochord which he wrote it resembled, and whose construction he described in more detail. He only described an indirect method of setting its tuning, however, requiring that he first establish reference pitches by transferring the corresponding string lengths to the movable bridges on a keyed thirteen string monochord whose open strings had been previously tuned in unison.{{ref|Strahle285|a}}

== Faggot's numerical representation ==

[[Image:1743Faggot table.png|250px|right]]
The article following Stråhle's was a mathematical treatment of it by '''Jacob Faggot''' (1699–1777), then secretary of the Academy of Sciences and future director of the Surveying Office, who in the same volume also contributed articles on a weight measure for lye&lt;!--"Beskrifning på en i Sverige brukelig Lutvigt" p.239--&gt; and methods for calculating the volume of barrels&lt;!--"Om runda Kärils Rymdemätning'' p.200--&gt;. Faggot was one of the first members of the Academy, and had also been member of a special commission on weights and measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfbg/0678.html "Jakob Faggot"] ''Nordisk Familjebok'' Band 7, Nordisk familjeboks förlags aktiebolag, Stockholm 1907 p.1259&lt;/ref&gt; He apparently was not a musician, though Helenius described he was interested in musical topics from a mathematical perspective and documented that he periodically came in contact with musical instrument makers through the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Helenius-Öberg [http://musikforskning.se/stm/STM1987/STM1987HeleniusOberg.pdf "Kyrkoherden Nils Brelin—Mechanicus och Klaverälskare"] ''Svensk Tidskrift för Musikforskning'' 1987 p.112&lt;/ref&gt; Helenius also presented a theory that Faggot had a more active, if indirect and posthumous influence on the construction of musical instruments in Sweden, claiming that he may have suggested the long tenor strings used in two experimental instruments built by Johan Broman in 1756 which she proposed influenced the type of clavichord built in Sweden in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The instruments—a harpsichord and clavichord, both in the Stockholm Music Museum collection—are notable for their extreme large size and long tenor strings, where string length doubling extends down five octaves, and three octaves and a fourth respectively. Both incorporate many of the ideas described by Brelin in an article the Academy's 1739 Proceedings; Helenius (1979)&lt;br /&gt;

In his analysis of Stråhle's article Faggot outlined the trigonometric steps he had used to calculate the sounding lengths of the individual pitches, for the purpose of comparing the new tuning produced by Stråhle's method, against a tuning with pure thirds, fourths and fifths (labeled "N.1." in the table), and equal temperament, which he called only "an older temperament and [which] is introduced in [[Johann Mattheson|Mr. Mattheson's]] ''Critica Musica''" ("N.2."),&lt;!--en äldre _Temperatur_, ock står införd i Herr _Matthesons Critica Musica_, pag. 32,--&gt; He intended the resulting set of figures to show whether "the tuning of the pitches, following the previously described invention, satisfies the ear with pleasant sounds and with better evenness, in the ''Musical'' pitches on a keyboard instrument, and therefore teaches understanding better can judge than the old and previously known manner of tuning, when the eye can see what the ear hears." {{ref|Faggot286|b}}

Both articles were reproduced in a German edition of the Academy's proceedings published in 1751,&lt;ref&gt;Dan. P. Stråhle, Neue Erfindung die Temperatur beym Stimmen für Töne auf dem Clavier u. d. g. Instrumenten zu finden. Jacob Faggot, Trigonometrische Berechnung für die neue Temperatur zu Stimmung der Töne auf dem Claviere. ''Der Königl. Schwedischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Abhandungen, aus der Naturlehre, Haushaltungskunst und Mechanik, auf das Jahre 1743.'' fünfter Band. aus dem Schwedischen übersetzt, von Abraham Gotthelf Kästner. Georg Christian Grund, Hamburg; Adam Heinrich Holle, Leipzig 1751 p.&amp;nbsp;226-229, 230-234&lt;!--http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/toc/?PPN=PPN324352840--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a table of Faggot's calculated string lengths was subsequently included by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg|Marpurg]] on his 1776 ''Versuch über die musikalische Temperatur'',&lt;ref name = "marpurg" /&gt; who wrote that he accepted their accuracy but that rather than accomplishing "Strähle"'s stated goal, the tuning represented an unequal temperament "not even of the tolerable type."{{ref|Marpurg167}}

The sounding lengths calculated by Faggot are substantially different from what would be produced according to Stråhle's instructions, a fact which appears to have been first published by [[:de:Christlieb Benedict Funk|Christlieb Benedict Funk]] in ''Dissertatio de Sono et Tono'' in 1779,&lt;ref&gt;reviewed in "Leipzig" ''Göttingische Anzeigen von gelehrten Sachen unter der Aufsicht der Königl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften.'' 32 Stück (11 März, 1780) Erste Band. Johann Christian Dieterich, Göttingen, 1780&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug0WAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA272--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The article reported that the actual tuning was nothing new since it did not differ significantly from the usual division of the octave.&lt;/ref&gt; and the tuning he created includes intervals tuned outside of the range conventionally used in Western art music. Funk is credited the observation of this discrepancy in [[Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler|Gehler]]'s ''Physikalisches Wörterbuch'' in 1791,&lt;ref&gt;''Dissertatio de Sono et Tono''. Leipzig. 1779. 4; cited by Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler "Ton" &lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=5qEtAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA387-IA8--&gt;''Physikalisches Wörterbuch oder Versuch einer Erklärung der vornehmsten Begriffe und Kunstwörter der Naturlehre'' Vierter Theil. Schwickertschen Verlage, Leipzig 1791 p.387-388&lt;/ref&gt; and Fischer's ''Physikalisches Wörterbuch'' in 1804,&lt;ref&gt;Johann Carl Fischer "Ton" ''Physikalisches Wörterbuch oder Erklärung der vornehmsten zur Physik'' Fünfter Theil. Heinrich Dieterich, Göttingen 1804 p.26&lt;/ref&gt; and the error was pointed out by [[Ernst Chladni]] in ''Die Akustik'' in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Florens Friedrich Chladni ''Die Akustik'' Breitkopf &amp; Härtel, Leipzig 1830 p.39&lt;/ref&gt; No similar comments appear to have been published in Sweden during the same period.

These works report Faggot's mistake as the result of having used a value from the tangent instead of the sine column from the logarithmic tables. The error itself consisted of making the angle of ''RP'' about seven degrees too great, which caused the effective length of ''QP'' to increase to 8.605. This greatly exaggerated the errors of the temperament compared to the tunings he presented alongside of it, although it is not clear whether Faggot observed these apparent defects as he made no further comments about Stråhle's construction or temperament in the article.

[[Image:1743straahle fifthsandthirdschart.png|thumb|200px|right]]

== The tuning ==

The tuning produced following Stråhle's instructions is a rational temperament with a range of fifths from 696 to 704 cents, which is from about one cent flatter than a [[quarter-comma meantone|meantone]] fifth to two cents sharp of [[Just intonation|just]] 3:2; the range of major thirds is from 396 cents to 404 cents, or ten cents sharp of just 5/4 to three cents flat of [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean]] 81/64. These intervals fall within what is considered to have been acceptable but there is no distribution of better thirds to more frequently used keys that characterize what are today the most popular of the tunings published in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which are known as ''[[well temperament]]s''. The best fifth is pure in the key of F♯—or the pitch given by ''MB''—which has a 398 cent third, and the best third is in the key E, which has a 697 cent fifth; the best combination of the two intervals is in the key of F and the worst combination is in the key of B♭.

== Barbour's algebraic representation and geometric construction==

J. Murray Barbour brought new attention to Stråhle's construction along with Faggot's treatment of it in the 20th century. Introduced in the context of Marpurg, he included an overview of it alongside the more famous methods of determining string lengths in his 1951 book ''Tuning and Temperament'' where he characterized the tuning as an "approximation for equal temperament". He also demonstrated how close Stråhle's construction was to the best approximation the method could provide, which reduces the maximum errors in major thirds and fifths by about half a cent and is accomplished by substituting 7.028 for the length of ''QP''.

Barbour presented a more complete analysis of the construction in "A Geometrical Approximation to the Roots of Numbers" published six years later in ''American Mathematical Monthly''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Murray Barbour "A Geometrical approximation to the Roots of Numbers" ''American Mathematical Monthly'' vol. 64 (1957) p.1-9&lt;/ref&gt; He reviewed Faggot's error and its consequences, and then derived Stråhle's construction algebraically using [[Similarity (geometry)|similar triangles]]. This takes the generalized form

&lt;math&gt;N^m \doteq \frac{OA + BA + (OA - 3BA) \times{m}}{OA +BA - 2BA\times{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the values from Stråhle's instructions this becomes

&lt;math&gt;\frac{24 + 10m}{24 - 7m}&lt;/math&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle OA-BA=1&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle OA+BA=\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt; leads to a form of the first formula that is more useful for calculation

&lt;math&gt;N^m \doteq \frac{Nm+\sqrt{N}(1-m)}{m+\sqrt{N}(1-m)}&lt;/math&gt;

Barbour then described a generalized construction using the easily obtained [[Geometric mean|mean proportional]] for the length of ''MB'' that avoids most of the specific angles and lengths required in the original. For musical applications it is simpler and its results are slightly more uniform than Stråhle's, and it has the advantage of producing the desired string lengths without additional scaling.

He instructed to first draw the line ''MR'' corresponding to the larger of  the two numbers with ''MP'' the smaller, and to construct their mean proportional at ''MB''. The line that will carry the divisions is drawn from ''R'' at any acute angle to ''MR'', and perpendicular to it a line is drawn through ''B'', which intersects the line to be divided at ''A'', and ''RA'' is extended to ''Q'' such that ''RA''=''AQ''. A line is drawn from ''Q'' through ''P'', intersecting the line through ''BA'' at ''O'', and a line drawn from ''O'' to ''R''. The construction is completed by dividing ''QR'' and drawing rays from ''O'' through each of the divisions.

Barbour concluded with a discussion of the pattern and magnitude of the errors produced by the generalized construction when used to approximate exponentials of different roots, stating that his method "is simple and works exceedingly well for small numbers". For roots from 1 to 2 the error is less than 0.13%—about 2 cents when ''N''=2— with maxima around ''m''=0.21 and ''m''=0.79. The error curve appears roughly sinusoidal and for this range of ''N'' can be approximated by about 99% by fitting the curve obtained for ''N''=1, &lt;math&gt;f(m)=m(1-m)(1-2m)&lt;/math&gt;. The error increases rapidly for larger roots, for which Barbour considered the method inappropriate; the error curve resembles the form &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f(x)=x(1-x^{2a})&lt;/math&gt; with maxima moving closer to ''m''= 0 and ''m''=1 as ''N'' increases.

===Schoenberg's refinements of Barbour's methods===

The paper was published with two notes added by its referee, [[Isaac Jacob Schoenberg]]. He observed that the formula derived by Barbour was a fractional linear transformation and so called for a perspectivity,&lt;!--"the linear fractional transformation clearly called for a perspectivity"--&gt; and that since three pairs of corresponding points on the two lines uniquely determined a projective correspondence&lt;!--"since a projective correspondence on lines is uniquely determined by three pairs of corresponding points,"--&gt; Barbour's condition that ''OA'' be perpendicular to ''QR'' was irrelevant. The omission of this step allows a more convenient selection of length for ''QR'', and reduces the number of operations.

Schoenberg also noted that Barbour's equation could be viewed as an interpolation of the exponential curve through the three points ''m''=0, ''m''=1/2 and ''m''=1, which he expanded upon in a short paper titled "On the Location of the Frets on the Guitar" published in ''American Mathematical Monthly'' in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac J. Schoenberg "On the Location of the Frets on a Guitar" ''American Mathematical Monthly'' vol. 83, 1976 p.550-2.&lt;/ref&gt; This article concluded with a brief discussion of Stråhle's fortuitous use of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac {41}{29}&lt;/math&gt; for the half-octave, which is one of the convergents of the [[Square root of two#Continued fraction representation|continued fraction expansion]] of the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the best rational approximation of it for the size of the denominator.

===Stewart and continued fractions===

The use of fractional approximations of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; in Stråhle's construction was expanded upon by Ian Stewart, who wrote about the construction in "A Well Tempered Calculator" in his 1992 book ''Another Fine Math You've Got Me Into...'' &lt;ref&gt;Ian Stewart ''Another Fine Math You've Got Me Into...'' Courier Dover Publications, 2004 p.246-252&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "Faggot's Fretful Fiasco" included in ''Music and Mathematics'' published in 2006. Stewart considered the construction from the standpoint of projective geometry, and derived the same formulas as Barbour by treating it from the start as a fractional linear function, of the form &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y= \frac{(ax+b)}{(cx+d)}&lt;/math&gt;, and he pointed out that the approximation for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; implicit in the construction is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac {17}{12}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the next lower convergent from the half octave it produces. This is the consequence of the function simplifying to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{p+2q}{p+q}&lt;/math&gt; for ''m''=0.5 where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the generating approximation.

==Similar methods applied to musical instruments==

The geometric and arithmetic methods for dividing monochords as well as musical instrument fretboards compiled by Barbour were for the stated purpose of illustrating the different tunings each represents or implies, and Schoenberg's and Stewart's works retained similar focus and references. Three textbooks on piano building that are not included by them show similar constructions to Stråhle's for designing new instruments but treat the tuning of their pitches independently; both constructions employ a non-perpendicular form as suggested by Schoenberg's observation in Barbour's "A Geometrical approximation to the Roots of Numbers", and one achieves optimal results while the other demonstrates an application with a root other than 2.

===Kützing===

Carl Kützing, an organ and piano maker in Bern during the middle of the 19th century wrote in his first book on piano design, ''Theoretisch-praktisches Handbuch der Fortepiano-Baukunst'' from 1833, that he devised a simple method of determining the sounding lengths in an octave after reading of the different geometric constructions described in an issue of Marpurg's ''Historisch-kritischen Beitragen zur Aufnahme der Musik'';&lt;!--Moses Mendelsohn, zweyte Aufgave, fuenfte Band--&gt; he stated that the divisions would be very accurate and that the construction could be used for fretting guitars.

Kützing introduced the construction following a description of a large [[sector (instrument)|sector]] to be made for the same purpose. He did not include either method in ''Das Wissenschaftliche der Fortepiano-Baukunst'' published eleven years later, where he calculated lengths using approximately 18:35 ratios between octave lengths and proposed a new method with a non-continuous curve adjusted for actual wire diameters in order to reduce tonal differences from jumps in tension.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Kützing. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2T8uAAAAYAAJ ''Das Wissenschaftliche der Fortepiano-Baukunst'']. J. F. J. Dalp. Bern und Chur, 1844&lt;/ref&gt;

Kützing instructed to extend a line segment ''bc''—representing a known sounding length—at 45 degrees to the line ba, and from its octave at point ''d'' located midway between ''b'' and ''c'', to extend a line perpendicular to ''ba'' intersecting it at ''e'', then to divide ''de'' into 12 equal parts. The point ''a'' on ''ab'' is located by transferring the lengths of ''de'', ''db'', from ''e'' away from ''b'', and rays extended from ''a'' through the points dividing ''de'' and intersecting ''bc'' to locate the different endpoints of the string lengths from ''c''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Kützing. Theoretisch-praktisches Handbuch der Fortepiano-Baukunst. J. F. J. Dalp. Bern und Chur, 1833. p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

This arrangement is equivalent to using the mean proportional to locate ''a''.

A re-labeled diagram with instructions was included in a pamphlet printed by England's largest piano manufacturers [[John Broadwood &amp; Sons]] to accompany their display at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London, where they described it as "a practical method of finding the lengths of Strings, for every note of the Octave on equal temperament; so that with wire of the same size the tension on each note shall be the same."&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Laurence. [http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/10949/ ''The Evolution of the Broadwood Grand Piano 1785-1998''] "fig. 6/6: Broadwood's scale design geometry, 1862" University of York Department of Music September 1998, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was also reproduced, alongside a sector, by Giacomo Sievers, a Russian-born piano maker working in Naples, in his 1868 book ''Il Pianoforte'', where he claimed it was the best practical method for determining sounding lengths of strings in a piano. Like Broadwood, Sievers did not describe its source or extent of its use, and did not explain any theory behind it. He also did not suggest it had any use beyond designing pianos.&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Sievers, Il Diagramma per lo spartimento delle corde. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=scores;cc=scores;view=toc;idno=1466882.0001.001 ''Il pianoforte; Guida Pratica per Costruttori, Accordatori, Dilettanti e Possessori di Pianoforti''] Stabilimento Tipografico Ghio, Napoli 1868. p.103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wolfenden===

English piano maker Samuel Wolfenden presented a construction for determining all but the lowest sounding plain string lengths in a piano in ''A Treatise on the Art of Pianoforte Construction'' published in 1916; like Sievers, he did not explain whether this was an original procedure or one in common use, commenting only that it was "a very practical method of determining string lengths, and in past years I used it altogether". He added that at the time of writing he found calculating the lengths directly "somewhat easier" and had preceded the description with a table of computed lengths for the top five octaves of a piano.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Wolfenden, String Lengths and Diameters. ''A Treatise on the Art of Pianoforte Construction'' 1916, reprinted by Unwin Brothers, London, 1975 p.23-33&lt;/ref&gt; He included frequencies in equal temperament, but only published aural tuning instructions in his 1927 supplement.

Wolfenden explicitly advocated equalizing the tension of the plain strings which he proposed to accomplish in the upper range by combining a 9:17 ratio between octave lengths with a uniform change in string diameters (achieving slightly more consistent results over the otherwise similar system published by Siegfried Hansing in 1888&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Hansing [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_pianoforte_and_its_acoustic_properti.html?id=zNc5AAAAIAAJ ''The Pianoforte and its Acoustic Properties''] second edition, translated by Emmy Hansing-Perzina. Siegfried Hansing, Schwerin i. M., 1904 p.84&lt;/ref&gt;), in contrast to Sievers scale whose stringing schedule results in higher tension for the thicker, lower sounding pitches.

Like Sievers, Wolfenden constructed all of the sounding lengths on a single segment at 45 degrees from the base lines for the rays, starting with points located for each C in the range designed at 54, 102, 192.5, 364 and 688mm from the upper point. The four vertices for the rays are then located by the intersections of the horizontal base lines extended from the lower C in each octave with a second line angled from the upper starting point for the string line, however, which he specified should both be at 51.5 degrees to the base lines and that the base lines have a 35:13 ratio with the difference between the two octave lengths.

Wolfenden's method approximates &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{17/9}&lt;/math&gt; with roughly &lt;!--&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 17/9-(sin(45)*(17/9)*(1+1/tan(51.5)))/((9/4)*(1+(17/9)/tan(51.5))+1) ~ &lt;/math&gt; (~1.3777)--&gt; 1.3775&lt;!--&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 17/9-(sin(pi/4)/sin(B)+1)*280/117*1/cos(pi/4) ~&lt;/math&gt; (~1.3774)--&gt;, and is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle OA/OB=8.27&lt;/math&gt; in Barbour's form. Compensating for its smaller octaves this produces 596 cent half octaves, an error of about 1mm at note F4 (f&amp;prime;) compared with his calculated figures.

The '''Vizag back-to-back HVDC station''', or '''Visakhapatnam back-to-back HVDC station''',  is a back-to-back [[HVDC]] connection between the eastern and southern regions in India, located close to the city of [[Visakhapatnam]], and owned by [[Power Grid Corporation of India]].

It consists of two independent poles, each with a nominal power transmission rating of 500&amp;nbsp;MW, referred to as Vizag 1 and Vizag 2.  
Vizag 1 was built by [[Alstom]] between 1996 and 1999 and has nominal DC voltage and current ratings of 205&amp;nbsp;kV, 2475 A. Its design is very similar to that of the [[Chandrapur back-to-back HVDC converter station]].

Vizag 2 was built by [[ABB Group|ABB]] between 2002 and 2005 and has nominal DC voltage and current ratings of 176&amp;nbsp;kV, 2841 A.

Both Vizag 1 and Vizag 2 use air-insulated, water-cooled thyristor valves.

On 31 December 2013, the Northern, Eastern and Western grids were synchronised with the Southern regional grid, creating a single synchronous AC grid over the whole of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powergridindia.com/_layouts/PowerGrid/User/ContentPage.aspx?PId=78&amp;LangID=English One Nation – One Grid], Powergrid website (retrieved 18 November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the converter station is no longer required for its original purpose of asynchronously linking the Eastern and Southern grids, although it can still be used as an embedded power flow device to help control power flow within the AC system.   The stations could potentially be dismantled and moved to elsewhere to export/import power from other countries. Sometimes the excess power fed to the southern grid by this HVDC link is flowing back to Western region through the 765 KV AC lines between Southern grid and the Western grid which is not desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1659">'''Water supply and sanitation in Pernambuco''' is characterized by high levels of access to [[water supply]] in urban areas, but also by poor service quality (intermittent supply), inadequate access to [[sanitation]], and insufficient access to [[improved water source]]s and [[improved sanitation]] in rural areas.

In urban areas, where 76% of [[Pernambuco|Pernambuco's]] 8.4 million inhabitants live, access to house connections for water supply is 91% and access to sewerage is 49%. Concerning service quality, rationing is a constant reality in about 85% of the municipalities, including the [[Recife]] Metropolitan Region. This is primarily to a lack of water resources, particularly during the dry season, and frequent [[drought]] conditions.

The State Secretariat of Water Resources (SRH) is in charge of both [[water resources management]] and water supply and sanitation policies. The State Water Company (COMPESA) is responsible for water and sanitation service provision in most of the state. COMPESA provides urban water supply and sewerage in 170 and 20 municipalities respectively, out of 189 in the State. The remaining municipalities are served by municipal public providers. COMPESA operates under concession contracts with municipalities and is regulated and supervised by the state-level multi-sector regulatory agency ARPE.

The city of Recife has pioneered [[Simplified sewerage|condominial sewers]] in Brazil.
