      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9177">The '''10/90 gap''' is the term adopted by the [[Global Forum for Health Research]] to highlight the finding by the [[Commission on Health Research for Development]] in 1990, that less than 10% of worldwide resources devoted to health research were put towards health in [[Developing Countries]], where over 90% of all preventable deaths worldwide occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.globalforumhealth.org/about1090-gap/|title = 10/90 gap|date = 2011|accessdate = April 16, 2015|website = Global Forum for Health Research|publisher = }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the spread of disease suffered in both rich and poor countries converges. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the most prevalent diseases consist of [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]] and [[diabetes]].  These diseases now{{When|date=June 2016}} account for 45% of the global health burden and is the culprit for up to 85% of deaths in low-income countries. The 10/90 Gap focuses on joining organisations together to reduce these statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Luchetti, M. (2014). Global health and the 10/90 gap. British Journal of Medical Practitioners, 7(4), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease and the 10/90 gap==

A substantial portion of diseases, most prevalent in impoverished or developing countries, are those which are preventable and/or treatable.&lt;ref name=Currat&gt;Currat, L.J., Francisco, A., Al-Tuwaijri, S., Ghaffar, A., &amp; Jupp, S. (2004). 10/90 report on health research 2003-2004. WHO Drug Information, 18(3), 243. Retrieved from http://announcementsfiles.cohred.org/gfhr_pub/assoc/s14789e/s14789e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization (2004) stated in their world health report that an estimated eight million individuals die prematurely, from diseases and conditions that can be cured, every year. These deaths contribute to approximately one third of all human deaths in the world, each year.&lt;ref name=Currat/&gt; Table 1 lists several of these curable diseases.

==Strategies for change==

Global health organisations across the globe have explicitly made research into health their priority. In 2000, World Health Organization established the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, who in their 2001 report, verified the relationship between poverty and disease and discussed the benefit of investment on the economic climates of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hotez P.J. |author2=Ferris M.T. | year = 2006 | title = The antipoverty vaccines | url = | journal = Vaccine | volume = 26 | issue = 24| pages = 31–31 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible strategies that can be implanted to help reduce the 10/90 gap are, policies prioritizing funding for health research, also developing capacities of credible public and private health research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, A., Kuruvilla, S., &amp; Borchert, M. (2004). Bridging the implementation gap between knowledge and action for health. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 82(10), 724–732.&lt;/ref&gt; Also activities of international NGOs to undertake research aimed at resolving the gap, and the setting up of research based mechanisms to ensure access to new effective products for the treatment and prevention of poverty-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kilama W. L. | year = 2009 | title = The 10/90 gap in sub-saharan africa: Resolving inequities in health research | url = | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = S8–S15 | doi = 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.08.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the number of diseases that are preventable, other factors that are blocking the access of patients to these products, such as cost of treatments to the individual, also need to be addressed, rather that just focusing on developing new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Diseases of Poverty and the 10/90 Gap|last = Stevens|first = Philip|publisher = International Policy Network|year = 2004|isbn = |location = London, UK.|pages = 7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a need to build the [[primary health care]] sector in developing countries. It has been shown that early detection and effective management of disease can be provided by appropriately-trained, non-physician, healthcare workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Global health: Noncommunicable diseases|last = Hunter|first = D.J.|date = 2013|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1109345|pmid = |last2 = Reddy|first2 = K.S.|volume=369|pages=1336–1343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health expenditure==

The gap between financial needs and financial means in low income countries can only be filled by donations. The average health expenditure per capita in western countries is estimated at $947 compared to $20 per capita in low income countries. To assist the worlds poorest, health expenditure between $44–60 per capita is placed as a target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.bjmp.org/content/global-health-and-1090-gap |title=Global Health and the 10/90 gap |last=Luchetti |first=Marco |date=2014 |journal=British journal of medical practitioners |issn=1757-8515 |pmid= |access-date=10 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Y5hRlONj?url=http://www.bjmp.org/content/global-health-and-1090-gap |archivedate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This target is achieved by the contribution of 0.1% of  advanced western countries gross national production (GNP) to fund global health, this recommendation was set by the WHO in 2001 and is estimated to save 8 million lives per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development|last = World Health Organization|publisher = World Health Organization|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Geneva|pages = 7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global research and development ==

Among other efforts to address this issue are recent proposals for a Global Research and Development ([[Research and development|R&amp;D]]) [[treaty]], and the creation of the nonprofit [[Pharmacology|pharmaceutical]] company [[Institute for OneWorld Health|OneWorld Health]] which develops new and affordable medicines for neglected diseases. A treaty creates a system that allows health research to come from contributions by all and therefore the sharing of benefits for all, improving the fairness and sustainability of global research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Innovation and Access to Medicines for Neglected Populations: Could a Treaty Address a Broken Pharmaceutical R&amp;D System?|last = Moon|first = Suerie|date = 15 May 2012|journal = PLOS Medicine|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001218|pmid = 22615544|pmc=3352855|volume=9|pages=e1001218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a positive development for the closing of the gap, in the 2012 [[London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases]] many parties, including governments, funding organisations and drug companies, agreed to work towards the eradication of [[neglected tropical diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Development assistance for neglected tropical diseases: Progress since 2009|last = Liese|first = Bernhard H|date = 2014|journal = International Health|doi = 10.1093/inthealth/ihu052|pmid = |last2 = Houghton|first2 = Natalia|last3 = Teplitskaya|first3 = Lyubov|issue = 3|volume = 6|pages = 162–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Despite the findings of the World Health Organization, and the disparity of curable diseases throughout developing and developed countries, some people believe the 10/90 gap is a myth.&lt;ref name=Vidyasagar&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vidyasagar|first1=D|title=Global notes: The 10/90 gap disparities in global health research|journal=Journal of Perinatology|date=2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=55–56|doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211402}}&lt;/ref&gt; They criticise the fact that simple medicines which stop curable and treatable conditions such as diarrhoea and malaria are available to these countries. The issue is not with the medicine, but with the ability for the affected to access it. Access to medicine can be inhibited by many circumstances such as poverty, strict government regime and inadequate healthcare systems and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Vidyasagar/&gt;

'''Ballot Measure 50''' was a [[legislatively referred state statute]] [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|ballot measure]] for the [[Oregon's statewide elections, 2007|November 6, 2007 special election ballot]] in the state of [[Oregon]]. This measure would have increased the tobacco tax and dedicated the new revenue to providing health care for children, low-income adults and other medically underserved Oregonians, and to fund tobacco prevention and education programs. The proposal would have increased the tax on cigarettes by 84.5 cents per pack, and increased the tax on other tobacco products.&lt;ref name="online guide"&gt;{{cite web

The purpose of the fund would have been to finance the [[Healthy Kids Program]] created by the 2007 legislature to provide affordable health care for uninsured children. The measure would have funded tobacco prevention programs, safety net clinics, rural health care and health care for Oregon’s lowest income families and individuals through the [[Oregon Health Plan]]. The campaigns for and against the measure spent the most money ever on a ballot measure election in the state's history.&lt;ref name="few"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/04/only_a_few_ballot_initiatives.html|title=Only a few ballot initiatives look to qualify for Oregon ballot this November|last=Mapes|first=Jeff |date=April 3, 2010|work=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the measure did not pass, these health care programs were not expanded, and the Healthy Kids Program did not become law.&lt;ref name="online guide"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">The '''2012 Guangxi cadmium spill''' (广西镉污染事件&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2012/02/03/CH1202030007.htm |title=有色金屬之鄉 污染危機未除 - 香港文匯報 |publisher=Paper.wenweipo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;) occurred in early January when toxic [[cadmium]] contaminated the [[Guangxi]] Longjiang river (龙江河) and water supply.

==Incident==
[[Hechi]] authorities estimated that more than 40,000 [[kilogram]]s of fish were found dead from January 15 to February 2 within the city limits.&lt;ref name="cdaily1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2012-02/04/content_14536059.htm |title=Officials fired over cadmium spill |publisher=chinadaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spill was caused by Jinhe Mining company (沿河兩岸工廠). The spill is estimated to be 80 times the official limit, according to regional government protection official Feng Zhennian&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16804833|title=Seven detained over China river cadmium spill|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A toxic slick stretching more than 100[[kilometres|km]] along the Longjiang river reached the Nuomitan hydroelectric station, 57&amp;nbsp;km upstream from [[Liuzhou]], with cadmium levels five times above the national standard.&lt;ref&gt;South China morning post. No easy fix as huge spill threatens Liuzhou's water . 31 Jan 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In one month 20 [[tonnes]] of toxic cadmium metals were spilled into the river.&lt;ref&gt;South China morning post. Toxic metal spill may be worst in decades. 1 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==
The government stopped supply of tap water to Liuzhou city, affecting 3.7 million residents.&lt;ref name="scmp1"&gt;South China morning post. Media blasts officials over toxic river pollution. 1 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seven company executives deemed responsible for the contamination were detained.&lt;ref name="scmp1" /&gt;  Seven government officials were fired, including two punished for the spill.&lt;ref name="cdaily1" /&gt;  According to local government officials from the [[Xinhua News Agency]], the pollution is under control after two weeks of cleanup. Shortly after the spill, residents of the city of Liuzhou emptied supermarkets of bottled water out of fear of contamination.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Many scientists working on purification decided to return to the river, despite being hospitalized for contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.linktv.org/videos/millions-affected-by-southern-china-cadmium-spill |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193237/http://news.linktv.org/videos/millions-affected-by-southern-china-cadmium-spill |archive-date=2012-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 60% of cadmium content in the Longjiang River in [[Hechi]], previously reported as five times higher than the restricted level, has been diluted and absorbed, according to experts.  [[Guangdong]], [[Macau]] and [[Hong Kong]] are said to be unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/33290-Cadmium-spill-threat-Macau-water-safety.html |title=Cadmium spill no threat to Macau water safety |publisher=Macau Daily Times |date= |accessdate=2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese environmentalists are calling for a cadmium pollution fund to be set up to compensate for the long-term impact of the spill, according to state-run newspaper ''[[China Daily]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2012-02/04/content_14536059.htm&lt;/ref&gt; "These kinds of disasters make it obvious that this is the time to change, to push for more transparency," says [[Ma Jun (environmentalist)|Ma Jun]], a well-respected Chinese green activist and director of the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204740904577193680165583346|title=Cadmium Spill Threatens Water Supply|author=Laurie Burkitt|date=1 February 2012|work=WSJ|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aldeadávila Dam''' is a [[concrete]] [[arch-gravity dam]] on the [[Douro]] River (also known as the Duero River) on the border between Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref name="Bureau"&gt;[http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/GR/GR-76-25.pdf ''Hydraulic Model Studies of Amaluza Dam Spillway.'' GR-25-76. Hydraulics Branch. Division of General Research. Engineering and Research Center. Bureau of Reclamation. United States Department of the Interior. December 1976, p. 9.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613145520/http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/pubs/GR/GR-76-25.pdf |date=2011-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Douro River forms the international boundary between Portugal and Spain. The nearest Spanish town is [[Aldeadávila de la Ribera]] in the [[Province of Salamanca]], about {{convert|11.3|km}} to the east. The nearest Portuguese town is [[Fornos (Freixo de Espada à Cinta)|Fornos]] in [[Bragança District]], about {{convert|8|km}} to the southwest. The Portuguese side of the river around the dam site lies within the [[International Douro Natural Park]].

==Overview==
In 1864, Portugal and Spain signed the "Treaty of Limits" (ratified in 1866), which established the present international boundaries of the two nations.&lt;ref name="Treaty"&gt;[http://www.eawag.ch/research_e/apec/seminars/Case%20studies/2004/douro_duero.pdf Dominguez, Damian; Manser, Reto; and Ort, Christoph. ''No Problems on Río Duero (Spain) - Rio Douro (Portugal)?'' Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich. 2004, pp. 9–10.]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed 2010-07-24; Martínez, José María Santafé. "The Spanish-Portuguese Transboundary Waters Agreements: Historic Perspective." ''Water International.'' 28:3 (September 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmaurice, Malgosia. ''Exploitation of Natural Resources in the 21st Century.'' The Hague: Kluwer Law International, 2003, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; A treaty on transboundary rivers, clarifying issues regarding the use of such rivers, was signed and affirmed in 1912.&lt;ref name="Treaty" /&gt;

A treaty regulating the development of hydroelectric facilities on the Douro River was signed in 1927.&lt;ref name="Treaty" /&gt; The Aldeadávila Dam was built by Spain pursuant to these treaties, and was the final dam to be built by Spain on the section of river allotted to that country.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt;

The dam is {{convert|140|m}} high&lt;ref name="Landau" /&gt; and its cost was estimated in 1962 at US$60,000,000 (about $443.5 million in 2010 inflated-adjusted dollars).&lt;ref name="Harness" /&gt; It was one of a series of very high dams built in Europe in the two decades after World War II; these were designed with a downstream face inclined toward the upstream flow.&lt;ref name="Landau" /&gt; This simplified the dam's design and construction (although it required more concrete to build), and more readily incorporated the [[spillway]]s into the dam face.&lt;ref name="Landau" /&gt; The dam's face is nearly vertical.&lt;ref&gt;Serebryanskii, V.M. "Engineering Bases of the Architecture of Hydraulic Developments With Arch Dams," ''Hydrotechnical Construction.'' 7:7 (July 1973), p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; Design work on the dam began in 1956, and construction completed in 1963.&lt;ref name="Birkhauser" /&gt; The structure was built by the [[Iberdrola Ingeniería y Construcción]] construction firm. Pedro Martínez Artola was the design engineer.&lt;ref name="Birkhauser"&gt;Rubió, Ignasi Solà-Morales; Capitel, Antón; and Rispa, Raúl. ''Birkhäuser Architectural Guide: Spain, 1920–1999.'' Basel: Birkhäuser, 1998, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The dam was built on high-quality [[granite]] rock.&lt;ref name="Stagg"&gt;Stagg, Kenneth G. and Zienkiewicz, O. ''Rock Mechanics in Engineering Practice.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1968, p. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; During construction, [[grout]]ing was used to fill cracks in the rock which ran parallel to the dam's foundation, and on the Portuguese bank where two fractures in the rock occurred.&lt;ref name="Stagg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, William R. ''State of Stress in the Earth's Crust: Proceedings of the International Conference, 1963.'' New York: Elsevier Pub. Co., 1964, p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underground power station and tunnels were excavated using a mining procedure known as large-chamber [[Stoping (mining method)|stoping]]. The use of this technique for the Aldeadávila Dam is considered a textbook example.&lt;ref&gt;Jimeno, E. Lopez; Jimino, C. Lopez; and Carcedo, Ayala. ''Drilling and Blasting of Rocks.'' New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1994, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The turbine and generator hall, and the transformer hall were both cut from solid granite as well. The turbine and generator room is {{convert|140|m}} long, {{convert|18|m}} wide, and {{convert|40|m}} deep.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt; The total volume of excavated material for all halls, rooms, and abutments was {{convert|600175|m3|yd3|sigfig=5}}.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt;

The structure has eight overflow [[Floodgate|gates]] which channel water into four spillways.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt; The spillways incorporate side piers on the upstream face to more correctly channel water over the dam so that each spillway discharges the same amount of water.&lt;ref&gt;Șentürk, Fuat. ''Hydraulics of Dams and Reservoirs.'' Highlands Ranch, Colo.: Water Resources Publications, 1994, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The spillways release their water slightly above the actual bed of the river,&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt; creating a waterfall effect when they are fully open. A spillway tunnel carved from granite in the right bank of the river augments the spillways and provides for additional overflow.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt; The total spillway capacity is half that of [[Grand Coulee Dam]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt; The [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]] provided $8.9 million (about $67.2 million in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) in credits in 1958 to Iberduero to enable it to purchase six 120 Megawatt (MW) turbines and other electrical equipment for the power generating station, all of which were supplied by American firms.&lt;ref&gt;Export-Import Bank of the United States. ''Export-Import Bank of the United States Annual Report.''  Washington, D.C.: Export-Import Bank of the United States, 1959, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam won Spain an international reputation as a builder of very large dams.&lt;ref&gt;"Spain." ''[[The New York Times]].'' October 25, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The dam's eye-catching, "ski jump" style spillways are its most noted feature, and have been called "outstanding" by leading dam engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Henry H. ''The Engineering of Large Dams.'' London: Wiley, 1976, p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

The canyon through which the Douro River flows is exceptionally deep and narrow, resulting in a reservoir that has a relatively small surface area for its immense size. In some ways, this limits use of the reservoir for recreational activities.  However, the Aldeadávila Dam reservoir is a popular one for [[boating]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipscomb, Kelly. ''Adventure Guide: Spain.'' Edison, N.J.: Hunter, 2005, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power plant===
Until the [[Alcántara Dam]], also in Spain, was built in 1969, the Aldeadávila Dam was the largest [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] plant in Europe.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Water Resources Association. ''Pumped Storage Development and Its Environmental Effects: Proceedings.'' Milwaukee: College of Applied Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 1971, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, and after some upgrades, it remains the largest in Spain, with a total output generating power of {{convert|1150|MW|hp}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boronat|first=Ernesto|title=Hydro Power|url=http://www.exergy.se/goran/hig/ses/06/hydro.pdf|publisher=Exergy|accessdate=25 July 2010|pages=34|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813084216/http://www.exergy.se/goran/hig/ses/06/hydro.pdf#|archivedate=2010-08-13|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam's original Aldeadávila I Power Station houses six {{convert|120|MW|hp|adj=on}} [[Francis turbine]]s for a total generating output of {{convert|720|MW|}}. In 1986, the Aldeadávila II Power Station extension was completed, adding two {{convert|211|MW|hp|adj=on}} [[Francis turbine|Francis pump-turbine]]s, boosting generating capacity by {{convert|420|MW|}}.&lt;ref&gt;"Speedy Construction Puts Aldeadavila On Course." ''World Water.'' January/February 1987, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

During periods when the demand for electricity is low (such as evenings, weekends, or during seasonal fluctuations), the dam's two pumped-storage generators can use its excess power-generating capacity to pump water back into the reservoir—enhancing reservoir capacity and storing water for periods when the demand for electricity is high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.objectifterre.over-blog.org/pages/Stations_de_pompage_turbinage_dans_le_monde-1389849.html|title=Worldwide list of pumped storage plants|publisher=Bbjectifterre|accessdate=25 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232549/http://objectifterre.over-blog.org/pages/Stations_de_pompage_turbinage_dans_le_monde-1389849.html#|archive-date=2013-12-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time it was constructed, the Aldeadávila Dam had the largest pumping station capacity in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''Spain.'' New York: Time, 1962, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam has two diversion tunnels, each {{convert|1400|m}} in length.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kyōkai, Nihon Damu. ''New Horizons: Topmost Dams of the World.'' Tokyo: Japan Dam Association, 1963, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Each tunnel has a {{convert|53|m|adj=on}} high surge tank.&lt;ref name="Dominy" /&gt; The dam also contains more than {{convert|12|km}} of tunnels which divert water to the electrical generation turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arteche.com/joyaspatrimonio/english/aldeadavila.html Arteche Group.

Another scene depicts workers walking into one of the dam's enormous tunnels. The final scenes of [[Antonio Mercero]]'s 1972 film, ''[[La cabina]]'' (''The Telephone Box'') were also filmed inside the dam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3947">'''Alexander Peddie''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[FRCPE]] LLD (1810-1907) was a Scottish physician and author. He served as President of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] from 1877 to 1879 and was co-founder of [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]].

== Life ==
[[File:The large Peddie monument, Warriston Cemetery.JPG|thumb|The Peddie monument, Warriston Cemetery]]
Alexander Peddie was born on 3 June 1810. He was the son of Rev James Peddie, an Edinburgh [[Minister of the Church of Scotland|minister]] on Bristo Street in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1810&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his early education at the [[Edinburgh High School]]. He studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], at the encouragement of [[John Abercrombie (physician)|Dr John Abercrombie]]. He undertook postgraduate studies in [[Paris]]. At the suggestion of Abercrombie, Peddie became an apprentice to [[James Syme]], a rising surgeon. Syme had established a public surgical hospital in [[Minto House]] where he also carried out limited classes for clinical instruction and a large class for systematic surgery. Peddie was one of these early apprentices. There he was associated with Dr John Brown who became his lifelong friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1907-01-01|title=Alexander Peddie, M.D., F.R.C.P.E., F.R.S.E., Etc., Edinburgh|jstor=20293097|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=2405|pages=291–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, Peddie obtained the Licence of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Royal College of Surgeons]] and his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] from the [[University of Edinburgh|University of Edinburgh.]] Peddie then travelled around Europe, spending time in Paris where he studied some special departments of medicine. On his return from postgraduate study in Paris he introduced the [[stethoscope]] to Edinburgh.

When Syme was given the Clinical Chair of Surgery in Edinburgh, Peddie became Superintendent of Minto House which was largely used for the medical care of the sick poor. At the same time he developed an extensive private practice in the city.

In 1845, Peddie was the first to recognise the contagious nature of [[puerperal fever]] and its intimate connection with [[erysipelas]] and [[phlebitic inflammation]]. He was one of the originators of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] and gave two papers on Diseases of Infancy and Childhood in which he stressed the need for such an institution. That he was a pioneer in [[preventive medicine]] is evidenced by a series of ten lectures which he gave in Edinburgh and surrounding towns on Violation of Laws of Health illustrated with diagrams by [[Diarmid Noel Paton|Sir Noel Paton]].

In 1863 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. Peddie became Fellow of the RCPE in 1845 and was elected president in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at home, 15 Rutland Street in Edinburgh's West End, on 19 January 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1906&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried with his parents in [[Warriston Cemetery]] in northern Edinburgh. His monument is a small granite stone behind the large Peddie monument (on its north side). His nephew, the architect [[John Dick Peddie]], lies adjacent.

[[File:D (2).jpg|thumb|282x282px|Stages Involve on a typical Assessment Day]]
An '''assessment day''' is usually used in the context of [[recruitment]]. On this day, a group of applicants who have applied for a particular role are invited to an [[assessment centre]], where a combination of selection techniques are used by the employers to measure suitability of an individual for the job role.These selection technique usually include exercises such as presentation, group exercise, one to one Interview, role play, psychometric test etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article: Assessment days as part of an interview process|url = https://www.theguardian.com/careers/assessment-days|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most large organisations like Banks, Audit and IT firms use assessment days to recruit the fresh talent in their graduate programmes. With an increase of popularity of assessment days, several training institutes have been formed that prepare candidates for assessment days, for example, Green Turn is a famous institute that prepare candidates for assessment days of big 4 accountancy firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Green Turn|url = https://www.greenturn.co.uk/|website = www.greenturn.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are several examples throughout history, but the term "Assessment" for recruiting employees was firstly used in [[World War II]] by [[German Army]] in early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.amazureconsulting.com/files/1/29141665/AssessmentCentresValidityAndOptions.pdf|title = why assessment centre validity is falling|date = |accessdate = |website = AM Azure Consulting Ltd|publisher = |last = AM Azure Consulting Ltd|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110813113254/http://www.amazureconsulting.com/files/1/29141665/AssessmentCentresValidityAndOptions.pdf|archive-date = 2011-08-13|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used this process to select military officers. The tasks involved certain tests and officers were rated on how well they performed and chosen for selection and promotion accordingly. Dr Simoneit, a German psychologist led the foundation of what became known as 'An Assessment' in German Army. The idea of starting this process was to get a better understanding of why certain officers did not act in the way they had said they would if they were selected or promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spies and Saboteurs|last = Morgan|first = William|publisher = Victor Gollancz Ltd|year = 1955|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further psychological and scientific methods were added to his original work later on by British Government. They recognised the importance of having an assessment day and a [[Army Officer Selection Board|War Office Selection]] was created using its own testing methods. Examples include the [[Admiralty Interview Board]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the  [[Army Officer Selection Board|Board]] of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWyrlcyQLyUC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Assessment and development centres |author1=Iain Ballantyne |author2=Nigel Povah |chapter=What is an Assessment Centre? |publisher=Gower Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-566-08599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AT&amp;T]] created a building for recruiting staff in the 1950s.  This was called The Assessment Centre and this was influential on subsequent [[personnel]] methods in other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JohpKEWvnYC&amp;pg=PT6 |title=Managing Assessment Centres |author1=John Sponton |author2=Stewart Wright | chapter=What is an assessment centre? |publisher=Pocketbooks |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-906610-05-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of having an assessment day is that, the organisation wants to see how candidates actually behave when they will be put in real work life situations, for example performing an exercise with a group of people under timed conditions.These behaviours will then get compared to the key behavioural criteria which have been specified for that job role. Although the original assessment days were focused on military duties and their specific exercises are unlikely to be used in a commercial or public environment, but it is still important to know that these exercises have been designed to judge the behaviour of an individual in performing a task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dealing With Assessment Centres|url = http://www.careerpsychologycentre.com/ac.html|website = www.careerpsychologycentre.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reason of employers having an assessment day is that, assessment days have a proven track record of finding the most suitable candidates for the job. They are usually attended by a group of candidates normally between 5 and 15 all of whom are being assessed. They are usually held for a full working day and it is important to remember that the assessment day is just a way of finding candidates suitability for the role. One Candidate is not in competition with the other candidates on the assessment day. If every candidate shows the right qualities and competencies the employer is looking for they will hire all of them. If none of the candidates meet the necessary standard, the employer will hire none of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = How to Succeed at an Assessment Centre|last = Harry|first = Tolley|publisher = Kogan Page Ltd|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 25–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessment day is usually organised by the human resource department of the organisation. There might be other managers of the company in the assessors panel to provide technical input. Larger organisations sometimes also hire or invites their occupational psychologists on the panel to provide professional reviews on the candidate's behaviour. Occasionally, if an assessment day involves role play exercises, some companies bring professional actors to play that part to assess the behaviour of candidates. For example, to play a role of a dissatisfied client. The idea behind this is to create a real life scenario. Some candidates often prefer this idea and find it easier to behave in the way as they would do in real life. Ultimately, the purpose of employers having an assessment day is to measure that how well candidates will deal with a situation that they might encounter in the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assessment Centre and Interviewing advice|url = http://www.rcn.org.uk/aboutus/working_for_the_rcn/interviewing_advice|website = www.rcn.org.uk|date = 2014-08-29|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages to undertake on Assessment Day ==
[[File:Ejbnk.jpg|thumb|270x270px|Most popular Assessment Day exercises.]]Assessment Day involves a list of exercises sometimes tailored to the job role individuals have applied for. Candidates on an assessment day are assessed against a list of competencies: '''KSA's – Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes'''. On each competency a score is given and this is assessed through a number of activities as explained below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Are KSAs? - VA JOBS|url = http://www.va.gov/jobs/hiring/apply/ksa.asp|website = www.va.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===    Group Exercise ===
The purpose of Group exercise is to test the interpersonal and teamwork skills of an individual and usually involve activities such has debating, discussing ideas and solving a challenging problem. The idea behind these activities is to judge whether the candidate will overpower the group or fade in the background when they have to work with people with different skills set. It is important that candidates remember that they are not necessarily competing with the others in the group but everybody is performing against the company standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Application process {{!}} Graduates {{!}} KPMG Careers in the UK|url = https://www.kpmgcareers.co.uk/graduates/how-to-apply/application-process#.VjYB52u5zNk|website = www.kpmgcareers.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===     In-tray Exercise ===
The results of this exercise illustrate candidate's organizational and prioritizing skills. The test gives the candidates an everyday example of multiple tasks which needs to be assessed and prioritized. This tests time perception and management and gives the assessors an insight into how the candidate will react in a real world situation. Most in-tray exercises are designed according to the job specification and they test a set of key competencies based on the values of the organization. For example, they focus on the delegation, independence and managing skills. It is vital that candidates think about the job role and competencies that employer is looking for when answering the questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Types of assessment tests|url = http://www.pwc.co.uk/careers/experienced/assessment/test-types.html|website = PwC|accessdate = 2015-11-01|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151020231621/http://www.pwc.co.uk/careers/experienced/assessment/test-types.html|archive-date = 2015-10-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Types of Aptitude Tests Are There|url = https://www.assessment-training.com/blogs/what-types-of-aptitude-tests-are-there|website = www.Assessment-Training.com|accessdate = 2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===    Psychometric Test ===
These tests are used to measure how people differ in their motivation, values, priorities and opinions. They are helpful for employers in analysing the more hidden traits of individuals and give them indication of their preferred working style. They also give an idea to assessors of candidate's current abilities. They can be quite difficult as normally they are performed under timed conditions, therefore it is advisable for candidates to practice before their assessment day. There are many different types of psychometric test but the commonly used by the employers are numerical reasoning test and verbal reasoning test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Psychometric Testing Guide &gt; What is Psychometric Testing {{!}} Psych Press {{!}} Talent Management Psychologists |url=http://www.psychpress.com.au/psychometric/psychometric-testing-guide.asp?what-is |website=www.psychpress.com.au |accessdate=2015-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006235945/http://www.psychpress.com.au/Psychometric/psychometric-testing-guide.asp?what-is |archivedate=2015-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role Play Exercise ===
A role play is designed according to the job role, its a fictional scenario, for example, candidates may have to face an angry customer if they have applies for a sales manager role, where one of the assessor will play the part of the angry customer. In this way assessors will challenge the candidates with different cross-questions and reasons behind the answers. Some companies even hire professional actors for role play exercise so the situation will be more close to real life and also they can assess the candidate accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Role Play Exercise {{!}} AssessmentDay.co.uk|url = https://www.assessmentday.co.uk/role-play-exercise.htm|website = www.assessmentday.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===   Presentation ===
Presentation on an assessment day usually tests a candidates ability of how confident he is in presenting ideas in front of a group of people. Some organizations give the topic of presentation in advance that candidates have to prepare, others give the topic on the assessment day and give candidates some time to prepare for it. This demonstrates their capabilities of presenting their finding and analyzing information under timed condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deliver a presentation that's worthy of a graduate job|url = https://targetjobs.co.uk/careers-advice/assessment-centres/275423-deliver-a-presentation-thats-worthy-of-a-graduate-job|website = TARGETjobs|publisher = |accessdate = 2015-11-01|last = TARGETjobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===   One-to-One Interview ===
This is usually the last stage of assessment day, If candidates have completed all other tasks, this is an ideal opportunity for individuals to ask questions from hiring managers and showcase them their talent and impress them with the research that they have done about the company and its products and services. This is one of the most important aspect of an assessment day as assessors get to know a candidate individually and it has a great impact on the selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lloyds Banking Group Careers - Where do you fit in? - Lloyds Banking Group plc|url = http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/careers/|website = www.lloydsbankinggroup.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessors on the assessment day only give credit for the knowledge skills and attitudes (KSA's) candidates exhibit during these exercises. They do not normally test the technical knowledge of job role. The final decision of whether to select or reject a candidate mostly depends on the competencies shown in the above activities.

== Strengths and Weaknesses ==

===   Strengths ===
Assessment Days are eminently fair and objective. They allow a broader range of selection methods to be used so therefore they are more accurate than a standard recruitment process. The tests which are used on assessment day gives an insight knowledge of applicant's psychological and social behaviour. The results from these tests, combined with other conventional sources of information plays an important role in selecting the most qualified candidate and also enables organizations in eliminating unsuitable candidates - helping the organizations to ensure that they put right people in right roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pros and Cons of Assessment Centers {{!}} Hendon Publishing|url = http://www.hendonpub.com/resources/article_archive/results/details?id=3975|website = |accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessment Days test the psychological behaviour of the person as what they can do, not what they know. It tests their ability to apply formal education in a real world situation. A person may have  a first class degree but he may not be able to make critical decisions under pressure or lack skills to delegate work to his team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Kaizen Connection: How Companies Pick Tomorrow's Workers.|author1=Feuer, Dale |author2=Lee, Chris. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 23–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercises and Activities involve at an assessment day are highly adaptable for all types of job roles and for all sorts of organizations. For example, can be designed for recruiting community service officers, sales assistants, detectives, IT Consultants, Audit Managers and jailers as well as police officers. Moreover, the cost associated with assessment day is usually lower as compared to the cost involve in many other recruitment processes'''.''' Because exercises involve on an assessment day are cost and time friendly and can be tailored to the budget of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessment centres, selection systems and cost effectiveness: an evaluative case study|last = Payne, T. |author2=Anderson, N.R. |author3=Smith, T |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = Personnel Review|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 48–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessment Days can also play an important role for candidates in terms of providing them with feedback about their strengths and weaknesses, which allows them to improve their skills and abilities for future roles. Assessment Days are also an ideal opportunity for candidates to understand the organisation and job role more closely and help them in making decision whether this is the right job role for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The benefits of assessment centres &amp; pitfalls to avoid|url = http://www.getfeedback.net/hrmanagers/assessment-centres-benefits|website = |accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===   Weaknesses ===
Assessment Days can be difficult to manage and there is always an uncertainty of things going wrong on the day. There can be system failure or may be other IT problems that can cause problems in performing various activities, for example, aptitude tests and psychometric tests can not be performed because of an immediate IT failure. Role players may fail to turn up or badly play their roles and therefore assessors may not be able to mark the exercise properly.

Furthermore, with an increase in technology people who have been to an assessment day of a company write about their experiences and nature of exercises involved on social websites and student forums which in result give all the answers to future candidates and they prepare themselves in advance which is sometimes not fair for selection process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessment Methods in Recruitment|last = Edenborough|first = Robert|publisher = Kogan Page Ltd|year = 2005|isbn = |location = London|pages = 200–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, candidates complain that they feel uncomfortable on an assessment day as they are just "role playing" and assessors don't get to know "the real me". Others complain that the time spent with an assessors is too limited for them to make a  right decision. Some also argue that exercises that are used for assessment days are too ambiguous and not close to job specification. Moreover, sometimes its hard for an organization to gather all their assessors and managers on the same day as the assessment process is very time consuming as it can lasts from 4 to 7 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessment Centers and Managerial Performance|author1=Thornton III |author2=George C. |author3=and Byham |author4=William C. |publisher = Elsevier Science|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies for Applicants &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Assessment Centres and Global Talent Management|last = Povah|first = Nigel|publisher = Gower Publishing, Ltd|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Applicants should follow the following strategies to succeed an assessment day:
* Research about the company, its products and services and if there is any recent news about this company before the assessment day.
* Applicants should arrive at least 15 minute before the starting time, some organisations may want candidates to arrive even early so they can check their documents.
* Be polite to everyone and shake hands with everyone, even with other candidates.
* Show interest in the discussion and try to mix up with everyone, employers at an assessment day usually judge social behaviour of candidates when they interact with others.
* Try to be confident in group exercises, don’t overpower the group and try to get others involve in the group discussion as it gives good impression on assessors.
* Applicants should request for feedback if they have been unsuccessful so they can improve their performance for next assessment day.

Qualified [[clinical officer]]s with working experience of more than three years and who pass a government entrance examination undergo a further two-year training program to become Assistant Medical Officers. They can then enroll in another two-year program to specialise in [[anaesthesia]], [[paediatrics]], [[radiology]] or [[surgery]].

The Assistant Medical Officers program, which combines theory and clinical training, is offered at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcmc.ac.tz/Amo.htm Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528151959/http://www.kcmc.ac.tz/Amo.htm |date=2008-05-28 }}, Tanzania.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ifakara Training Centre for International Health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthtrainingifakara.org/index.php?id=82 Ifakara Training Centre for International Health], Tanzania.&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant medical officers training centers in Mbeya (located near Mbeya referral Hospital), Tanga (located near Bombo Regional referral Hospital) and Bugando-Mwanza(located near Bugando referral Hospital), Lugalo Military school in [[Dar es Salaam]], and a new school opened in Arusha -Selian medical center.

Assistant Medical Officers perform routine and emergency surgery including 80 percent of [[Caesarean section]]s done in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="PLOS"/&gt;

===Malaysia===
Assistant Medical Officers complete a three and half year diploma in medical assistant undergraduate program recognized by the [[Malaysian Qualifications Agency]]. The students study the human body; how the systems, e.g. cardiovascular and respiratory systems, medical and surgical study, pharmacology, work in normal and diseased states and how they relate to medicine. They also learn pre-hospital care, community health, disaster management, orthopedics, obstetrics and gynecology and surgery. The final year of training involves clinical placement in hospitals and [[clinic|health clinics]].

'''Babinden''' ({{lang-bg|Бабинден}}, {{lang-ru|Бабьи каши, Бабий день}} the ''Day of the baba'' or the D''ay of the midwife'') is a traditional Bulgarian feast, celebrated on 8 January (21 January according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]), in honour of the women practicing [[midwifery]]. The traditional word for [[midwife]] in Bulgarian is ''baba'', same as grandmother. The holiday has [[pagan]] origins and is part of the traditional [[family rituals]].

On Babinden, all children born in the previous year and their mothers gather at the house of the midwife to perform the following rituals:
* '''''The bathing of the children by the midwife''''', followed by blessings, anointment of the babies with honey and butter and presenting the midwife of gifts (wool and ritual bread in the form of small pretzels). The ritual is performed to ensure health for all participants.
* '''''The young mothers' feast'''''. The young mothers (those who have given birth in the last one year) bring bread, [[banitsa]] (traditional cheese filo pastry akin to the Greek [[tiropita]]), grilled chicken and wine. They help the midwife wash and present her with new clothes - shirt, apron, kerchief, socks, etc.  
* '''''The bathing of the midwife''''' (performed only in some parts of the country). After the young mothers' feast, the midwife is taken to the nearest water place (river, lake or well) and is ritually bathed.

Men may not participate in the rituals.

== Rituals ==
The ''baba'' holds a particularly exalted place in the traditional family life. She is universally honoured and loved for her skills in bringing about new life.

Just before sunrise the mothers of children under the age of three go to the common well to draw fresh water. In it they dip a sprig of [[basil]] or [[geranium]]. Then they take a bar of soap and a new towel and make way to the house of the midwife.
'''The bathing ritual''' is performed outdoors - under a fruit tree in the garden, on the wood chopping block or on the front stairs of the house. (Traditional Bulgarian houses have their bottom floor half dug in the ground, under the street level; thus the main housing level is slightly elevated with a stone staircase leading to the front door of the house.) Every woman hands the midwife the soap, pours some water to wash her and then presents her with the new towel. The midwife, however, wipes her hands dry with the skirts of woman - to be fertile and to have easy deliveries. The midwife then presents the woman with a bunch of geraniums tied with red and white threads. While washing, the midwife may splash the water up in the air, jump three times and say "So may jump the kids and become white and red [eg healthy clear skin with rosy cheeks]! May the harvest and health beas  abundant as these water droplets!"
After the bathing the women present the midwife with gifts of shirts, socks, cloth, which they sling on her right shoulder. In return the midwife ties a bracelet of red and white threads with a silver coin on the right arm of each child she has delivered and gives him or her socks and shirts. Then she ritually washes the face of the child as it is believed that the water which passes the hands of the ''baba'' on Babinden has cleansing properties.
In some part of Bulgaria it is customary for mothers to take their children to be blessed by the ''baba'' until the children reach the age of three.

The baba performs and another ritual role. Immediately after the delivery of the baby, the ''baba'' fills a clay jug with water, dips a sprig of basil or geranium in it and takes it to the church. There the priest blesses the water and the midwife, who then brings the holy water back to the mother. For the next forty days (traditionally, the cleansing period after childbirth) the mother is to use a little bit of the holy water in the baby daily bath.

At lunch time on Babinden the '''mothers prepare a feast''' in the house of the midwife. Every woman brings a freshly baked [[pogacha]] (ritual bread), [[banitsa]], boiled or grilled chicken (traditionally, a hen is slaughtered) and a jug with wine or [[rakia]] (home-made fruit brandy). Each woman kisses the midwife's hand and gifts her the food. The daughters and daughters-in-law of the hostess set a long and rich table for all the guests. The dinner is accompanied with many songs, dances and much sexually-suggestive joking and banter. The midwife wears a strong of red peppers around her neck and performs fertility rites as the dinner progresses. Only after the meal has concluded may the men join in.

The Feast of Babinden culminates in the '''ritual bathing of the midwife'''. The men and women guests take the baba outside and seat her in a carriage or a sleigh. In some parts of the country a large wicker basket is used. The men, dressed as oxen with hides, masks and horns, pull the carriage or sleigh around the village. If they meet a man on the way, the women ask for ransom. The merry company makes its way to the river and bathes the midwife. This particular ritual is called ''vlechugane'' (Haulage) of the midwife.

In the evening there is a feast at the town square. The traditional ''[[Horo (dance)|horo]]'' (a particular form of line dancing) is performed . The ''horo'' escorts the ''baba'' to her home. There everyone kisses her hand again and presents her with more gifts.

== Traditional beliefs ==
Children hold a special place in the Bulgarian culture. Many traditional sayings testify to this; for example "''A childless house is a burnt house''" and "''The child is bigger than a king''". There is a complex system of traditional beliefs about what should and should not be done in order to have an easy pregnancy and delivery, and a healthy child. 
* Children should not be conceived on the night of Friday to Saturday.
* A pregnant woman may not kick a dog or a cat, step over fire tongs, eat a bread that has been left over from a journey, step on spilled water or litter.
* A pregnant woman may not steal and eat in secret because the stolen or the eaten item will manifest itself as a scarring or a birthmark on the baby. 
* A pregnant woman should receive all she craves.
* If food is hidden from a pregnant woman, the baby will be a fastidious eater and sickly.
* A pregnant woman should be protected from becoming scared, startled or shocked.

For an easy delivery the ''baba'' should: 
* make the sign of the cross three times, 
* burn incense and bless with it the house, 
* close all windows and doors and untie all that is bound.

The delivery itself is to be kept secret from all but the ''baba'' and the woman's mother-in-law.

Until the baby is baptised, the young mother should stay in bed and should not be left alone. These days are dangerous for her and the baby.

The fire in the house should not be put out until the 40th day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6065">'''Caragea's plague''' or '''Caradja's plague''' ({{lang-ro|Ciuma lui Caragea}}) was a [[bubonic plague]] [[epidemic]] that occurred in [[Wallachia]], mainly in [[Bucharest]], in the years 1813 and 1814. It coincided with the rule of the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[John Caradja]].

==Alleged source==

As Caradja came to Bucharest in 1812 after being appointed prince, the plague was already claiming victims in [[Istanbul]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital. A man in Caradja's [[retinue]] grew sick and died. It is alleged that this was the source of the plague in Wallachia, although the next reported death from plague in Wallachia occurred in June 1813. 

The plague was expected and in January 1813, Caradja founded two [[quarantine]] hospitals, one in [[Teleorman]] and one in [[Giurgiu]].&lt;ref name="Ionescu287"&gt;Ionescu, p. 287-293&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak and measures taken==

There were reports of people with the plague on the streets of Bucharest as early as in April, but the first death attributed to bubonic plague was on 11 June 1813 in [[Văcărești, Bucharest|Văcăreşti]]. Quarantine was established, the gates of the city of Bucharest were closed and all the roads from Văcăreşti to [[Dealul Spirii]] were guarded to prevent anyone from entering the city without permission.&lt;ref name="Ionescu287"/&gt;

Government clerks and priests had to check each house for plague-infected people, all the foreigners and non-residents were expelled from the city, and the beggars were sent to monasteries outside Bucharest. The money which came from the counties where the plague was spread (Ilfov, Vlaşca, Teleorman and Olt) had to be washed in vinegar and the number of gravediggers was increased to 60.&lt;ref name="Ionescu287"/&gt;

In spite of that, the plague continued to spread, mostly due to lack of qualified medical care. The July 1813 register books of the Wallachian government show that most of the decrees were related to the plague. Among the restrictions, meetings in pubs and coffee shops were forbidden, alcohol being only sold for home consumption. The people who died had a simple burial with no attendants. The people who hid sick people or the peddlers ("both Jewish and Christians") were expelled from the city and their belongings were burnt. In August, due to the spread of the plague, the request to allow people to flee the city was approved, Caradja asking the [[ispravnic]]s to take care to avoid contact with the villagers. To avoid crowds, markets and schools were closed down, most judicial proceedings were stopped, and the people in the [[debtors' prison]] were freed.&lt;ref name="Ionescu287"/&gt;

Many of the new rules were not respected, despite the rulers' attempts, which included the spread of printed fliers. By August, the city became almost deserted, with even the doctors fleeing, as did Caradja, who moved his residence outside Bucharest to [[Cotroceni]]. The French consul said that two-thirds of the Bucharesters fled.&lt;ref name="Ionescu287"/&gt;

Initially, sick people were to be committed to the [[Dudești, Bucharest|Dudeşti]] hospital (later also [[Cioplea]] and [[Băneasa]]), but soon the 14 quarantine rooms of the unit were overrun, and the place became a simple mass grave.

People with immunity to the disease were hired as undertakers, and walked from door to door to gather corpses. The corpses were taken to the mass graves in Dudeşti and buried there. Often, dying people were taken also and buried alive, and sometimes beaten to death. An undertaker squad once reported that "we collected 15 dead today, but only buried 14, because one of them ran away".&lt;ref&gt;''"Azi am adunat 15 morţi, dar n-am putut îngropa decât 14, fiindcă unul a fugit şi nu l-am putut prinde."'' quoted by [[Ion Ghica]] in [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Scrisori_către_Vasile_Alecsandri:Din_vremea_lui_Caragea a letter] to [[Vasile Alecsandri]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, sick people with enough strength fought back, and killed the undertakers.&lt;ref name="Ionescu287"/&gt;

The highest mortality was in October 1813; the gravediggers couldn't even bury all the dead, and many of them were put in large pits, which were not covered and many "were eaten by dogs and other beasts". In February 1814, the last market still open, Târgul de Afară ([[Obor]]), was closed down, but soon the people returned to the city. In 1818 the quarantine hospitals of [[Plumbuita Monastery|Plumbuita]] and Văcăreşti were closed down.&lt;ref name="Ionescu287"/&gt;

==Death toll==

An estimated 60,000 people died of the plague in the two years, 20–30,000 of them in Bucharest, which is a large number, as the city population at the time was about 120,000. According to a church teacher, the church reports say that 20,000 died in Bucharest by January 1814 (excluding those buried in backyards), while the personal doctor of Caradja claimed that between 25,000 and 30,000 died.&lt;ref name="Ionescu287"/&gt;

According to the 1831 census (taken right after another [[cholera]] epidemic), the population of Bucharest was about 60,000 people.

'''Cycling''', also called '''bicycling''' or '''biking''', is the use of [[bicycle]]s for [[transport]], [[recreation]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]] or [[sport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = Second| year = 1989| publisher = Oxford University Press| quote = cycling: The action or activity of riding a bicycle etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Worldometers |url=http://www.worldometers.info/bicycles/ |title=Bicycles produced in the world |accessdate=2014-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.

Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/question527.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "Is there a way to compare a human being to an engine in terms of efficiency?" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Komanoff |first1=Charles |editor1-last=Cleveland |editor1-first=Cutler J. |year=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of Energy |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-12-176480-7 |doi=10.1016/B0-12-176480-X/00185-6 |chapter=Bicycling |pages=141–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; optimal for short to moderate distances.

Bicycles provide numerous benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, [[bike path]]s and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of [[fossil fuel]]s, less [[air pollution|air]] or [[noise pollution]], and much reduced [[traffic congestion]]. These lead to less financial cost to the user as well as to society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noexam.com/benefits-of-biking/ |title=Benefits of Biking | work=NoExam |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Flamm, B. |author2=Rivasplata, C. |date=2014 |title=Perceptions of Bicycle-Friendly Policy Impacts on Accessibility to Transit Services: The First and Last Mile Bridge |journal= MTI report |publisher=Mineta Transportation Institute |url=http://transweb.sjsu.edu/PDFs/research/1104-bicycle-policy-transit-accessibility-first-last-mile.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadracycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wardlaw MJ |title=Three lessons for a better cycling future |journal=BMJ |volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1582–5 |year=2000 |pmid=11124188 |pmc=1119262 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1582 }}&lt;/ref&gt; often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances.

In many countries, the most commonly used vehicle for road transport is a [[utility bicycle]]. These have frames with relaxed geometry, protecting the rider from shocks of the road and easing steering at low speeds. Utility bicycles tend to be equipped with accessories such as mudguards, pannier racks and lights, which extends their usefulness on a daily basis. As the bicycle is so effective as a means of transportation various companies have developed methods of carrying anything from the weekly shop to children on bicycles. Certain countries rely heavily on bicycles and their culture has developed around the bicycle as a primary form of transport. In Europe, Denmark and the Netherlands have the most bicycles per capita and most often use bicycles for everyday transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecf.com/press-corner/cycling-facts-and-figures/|title=European Cyclists' Federation – Cycling facts and figures|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120213149/http://www.ecf.com/press-corner/cycling-facts-and-figures/|archivedate=2015-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_312_en.pdf |title=This version of the web site is now archived - Cette version du site web est archivée. |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205185930/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/flash/fl_312_en.pdf |archivedate=February 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road bikes tend to have a more upright shape and a shorter wheelbase, which make the bike more mobile but harder to ride slowly. The design, coupled with low or dropped handlebars, requires the rider to bend forward more, making use of stronger muscles (particularly the [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]]) and reducing air resistance at high speed.

The price of a new bicycle can range from US$50 to more than US$20,000 (the highest priced bike in the world is the custom Madone by [[Damien Hirst]], sold at $500,000 USD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/stages/hirst/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120226083113/http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/stages/hirst |archivedate= February 26, 2012 |title=Trek Bicycle: The world's best bikes for road, mountain, or town |publisher=Trekbikes.com |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate= February 25, 2007 |url= http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-1-2-15285-1,00.html |title= Custom Bike Builders: Groupe de Tete |publisher=bicycling.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070225094609/http://www.bicycling.com/article/1%2C6610%2Cs1-1-2-15285-1%2C00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on quality, type and weight (the most exotic road bicycles can weigh as little as 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg (7&amp;nbsp;lb)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=November 14, 2011 |url=http://www.light-bikes.com/bikegallery/BikeListing.asp?id=1507 |title= SPIN Custom...7.04 lbs |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111114120218/http://www.light-bikes.com/bikegallery/BikeListing.asp?id=1507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, [http://www.uci.ch/Templates/UCI/UCI5/layout.asp?MenuID=MTYxNw&amp;LangId=1 UCI] regulations stipulate a legal [[Racing bicycle|race bike]] cannot weigh less than 6.8&amp;nbsp;kg (14.99&amp;nbsp;lbs). Being measured for a bike and taking it for a test ride are recommended before buying.

The [[bicycle#Drivetrain and gearing|drivetrain]] components of the bike should also be considered. A middle grade [[dérailleur]] is sufficient for a beginner, although many utility bikes are equipped with [[hub gear]]s. If the rider plans a significant amount of [[hillclimbing (cycling)|hillclimbing]] a triple-chainrings [[crankset]] [[bicycle gearing|gear system]] may be preferred. Otherwise, the relatively lighter and less expensive double chainring may be better. Much simpler fixed wheel bikes are also available.

Many road bikes, along with mountain bikes, include [[clipless pedal]]s to which special shoes attach, via a [[cleat (shoe)|cleat]], enabling the rider to pull on the pedals as well as push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and rear lights, [[Bicycle bell|bells]] or horns, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage racks, baggage carriers and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages.

For basic maintenance and repairs cyclists can carry a [[bicycle pump|pump]] (or a [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cartridge]]), a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and [[tire levers]] and a set of [[allen keys]]. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special [[cycling shoe|shoes]], [[cycling gloves|gloves]], and [[cycling shorts|shorts]]. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor vehicle users.

Items legally required in some jurisdictions, or voluntarily adopted for safety reasons, include [[bicycle helmet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yescycling.com/bicycle-helmet-laws-in-the-us/|title=Bicycle Helmet Laws In The US - The Complete List - Yes Cycling|date=2017-03-25|work=Yes Cycling|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; generator or battery operated lights, [[retroreflector|reflectors]], and audible signalling devices such as a bell or horn. Extras include [[studded tires]] and a [[cyclocomputer|bicycle computer]].

Bikes can also be heavily customized, with different seat designs and handle bars, for example.

==Skills==
Many schools and police departments run educational programs to instruct children in bicycle handling skills and introduce them to the [[Traffic#Rules of the road|rules of the road]] as they apply to cyclists. In different countries these may be known as [[bicycle rodeo]]s or operated as schemes such as [[Bikeability]]. Education for adult cyclists is available from organizations such as the [[League of American Bicyclists]].

Beyond simply riding, another skill is riding efficiently and safely in traffic. One popular approach to riding in [[motor vehicle]] traffic is [[vehicular cycling]], occupying road space as car does. Alternately, in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands, where cycling is popular, cyclists are often segregated into bike lanes at the side of, or more often separate from, main highways and roads. Many primary schools participate in the national road test in which children individually complete a circuit on roads near the school while being observed by testers.

==Infrastructure==

Cyclists, pedestrians and motorists make different demands on road design which may lead to conflicts. Some jurisdictions give priority to motorized traffic, for example setting up one-way street systems, free-right turns, high capacity roundabouts, and [[interchange (road)|slip roads]]. Others share priority with cyclists so as to encourage more cycling by applying varying combinations of [[traffic calming]] measures to limit the impact of motorized transport, and by building [[bike lane]]s, [[bike path]]s and [[cycle track]]s.

In jurisdictions where motor vehicles were given priority, cycling has tended to decline while in jurisdictions where cycling infrastructure was built, cycling rates have remained steady or increased. Occasionally, extreme measures against cycling may occur. In Shanghai, where bicycles were once the dominant [[mode of transport]], bicycle travel on a few city roads was banned temporarily in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3303655.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas in which cycling is popular and encouraged, cycle-parking facilities using [[bicycle stand]]s, lockable mini-garages, and patrolled cycle parks are used in order to reduce theft. Local governments promote cycling by permitting bicycles to be carried on public transport or by providing external [[Bicycle carrier|attachment devices]] on public transport vehicles. Conversely, an absence of secure cycle-parking is a recurring complaint by cyclists from cities with low [[modal share]] of cycling.

Extensive cycling infrastructure may be found in some cities. Such dedicated paths in some cities often have to be shared with in-line skaters, scooters, skateboarders, and pedestrians. Dedicated cycling infrastructure is treated differently in the [[bikeway and legislation|law]] of every jurisdiction, including the question of liability of users in a collision. There is also some debate about the [[bikeway safety|safety]] of the various types of separated facilities.

Bicycles are considered a sustainable mode of transport, especially suited for urban use and relatively shorter distances when used for transport (compared to recreation). Case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate this kind of functional cycling in cities can be found at [[Eltis]], Europe's portal for local transport.

A number of cities, including Paris, London and [[Bicing|Barcelona]], now have successful [[bicycle sharing|bike hire schemes]] designed to help people cycle in the city. Typically these feature utilitarian city bikes which lock into docking stations, released on payment for set time periods. Costs vary from city to city. In London, initial hire access costs £2 per day. The first 30 minutes of each trip is free, with £2 for each additional 30 minutes until the bicycle is returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Utrecht-IMG 7481.JPG|thumb|The safe physically separated ''Fietspad'' in the Netherlands, keeping cyclists away from traffic as seen in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].]]

In the Netherlands, many roads have one or two separate [[cycleway]]s alongside them, or cycle lanes marked on the road. On roads where adjacent bike paths or cycle tracks exist, the use of these facilities is compulsory, and cycling on the main carriageway is not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004825/HoofdstukII/i1/Artikel5/geldigheidsdatum_01-10-2012|title=wetten.nl  - Wet- en regelgeving - Reglement verkeersregels en verkeerstekens 1990 (RVV 1990) - BWBR0004825|work=overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 35,000&amp;nbsp;km of cycle-track has been physically segregated from motor traffic,&lt;ref name="fietsberaad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fietsberaad.nl/index.cfm?lang=nl&amp;section=nieuws&amp;mode=newsArticle&amp;repository=The+Netherlands+boast+almost+35.000+km+of+cycling+paths|title=The Netherlands boast almost 35.000 km of cycling paths|work=fietsberaad.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbs.nl/NR/rdonlyres/9F9F3F71-9324-46D3-AD7E-076C59F8392D/0/2015factsheetnederlandfietsland_ENG.pdf Factsheet The Netherlands: cycling country — [[Statistics Netherlands|CBS]]]&lt;/ref&gt; equal to a quarter of the country's entire 140,000&amp;nbsp;km road network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2085.html#nl |title=CIA World Factbook &amp;#124; Field listing: Roadways  |date=2014 |website=www.cia.gov |publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Utility===

{{Main article|Utility cycling}}

Utility cycling refers both to cycling as a mode of daily [[commuting]] transport as well as the use of a bicycle in a commercial activity, mainly to transport goods, mostly accomplished in an [[Urban area|urban environment]].

The [[mail|postal services]] of many countries have long relied on bicycles. The British [[Royal Mail]] first started using bicycles in 1880; now bicycle delivery fleets include 37,000 in the UK, 25,700 in Germany, 10,500 in Hungary and 7000 in Sweden. In Australia, Australia Post has also reintroduced bicycle postal deliveries on some routes due to an inability to recruit sufficient licensed riders willing to use their uncomfortable motorbikes. The [[London Ambulance Service]] has recently introduced bicycling [[paramedic]]s, who can often get to the scene of an incident in [[Central London]] more quickly than a motorized ambulance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/calling_999/who_will_treat_you/single_responder/cycle_responder.aspx |title=Cycle Responder |work=London Ambulance Service |publisher=London Ambulance Service NHS Trust |accessdate=2016-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402031208/http://www.londonambulance.nhs.uk/calling_999/who_will_treat_you/single_responder/cycle_responder.aspx |archivedate=2016-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Police bicycle|bicycles by police]] has been increasing, since they provide greater accessibility to bicycle and pedestrian zones and allow access when roads are  congested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Bicycles enjoy substantial use as general delivery vehicles in many countries. In the UK and North America, as their first jobs, generations of teenagers have worked at delivering newspapers by bicycle. London has many delivery companies that use bicycles with trailers. Most cities in the West, and many outside it, support a sizeable and visible industry of [[Bicycle messenger|cycle couriers]] who deliver documents and small packages. In India, many of Mumbai's [[Dabbawala]]s use bicycles to deliver home cooked lunches to the city’s workers. In [[Bogotá]], Colombia the city’s largest bakery recently replaced most of its delivery trucks with bicycles. Even the car industry uses bicycles. At the huge [[Mercedes-Benz]] factory in [[Sindelfingen]], Germany workers use bicycles, color-coded by department, to move around the factory.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Recreational===

====Bicycle touring====
{{Main article|Bicycle touring}}
[[File:WhiteBikesVeluwe.jpg|thumb|In the Netherlands, bicycles are freely available for use in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]].|alt=A white bicycle parked in the grass.]] [[File:Bikes in Portland.jpg|thumb|Tour de Fat group ride in [[Portland, Oregon]]|alt=Many bicyclists with colorful clothes]]

Bicycles are used for recreation at all ages. [[Bicycle touring]], also known as cyclotourism, involves touring and exploration or sightseeing by bicycle for leisure. A [[brevet (cycling)|brevet]] or randonnée is an organized long-distance ride.

One popular Dutch pleasure is the enjoyment of relaxed cycling in the [[rural|countryside]] of the Netherlands. The land is very flat and full of public [[bike path|bicycle trails]] and [[cycle track]]s where cyclists are not bothered by cars and other traffic, which makes it ideal for cycling recreation. Many [[Dutch people]] subscribe every year to an event called ''[[fietsvierdaagse]]''&amp;nbsp;— four days of organised cycling through the local environment. [[Paris–Brest–Paris]] (PBP), which began in 1891, is the oldest bicycling event still run on a regular basis on the open road, covers over {{convert|1200|km|0|abbr=on}} and imposes a 90-hour time limit. Similar if smaller institutions exist in many countries.

====Organized rides====
Many [[cycling club]]s hold organized rides in which bicyclists of all levels participate. The typical organized ride starts with a large group of riders, called the mass, bunch or even [[peloton]]. This will thin out over the course of the ride. Many riders choose to ride together in groups of the same skill level to take advantage of [[drafting (racing)|drafting]].

Most organized rides, for example [[cyclosportive]]s (or gran fondos), [[Challenge riding|Challenge Rides]] or [[reliability trial]]s, and [[Hillclimbing (cycling)|hill climbs]] include registration requirements and will provide information either through the mail or online concerning start times and other requirements. Rides usually consist of several different routes, sorted by mileage, and with a certain number of rest stops that usually include refreshments, first aid and maintenance tools. Routes can vary by as much as {{convert|100|mi|km}}.

====Mountain====
[[Mountain biking]] began in the 1970s, originally as a downhill sport, practised on customized [[cruiser bicycle]]s around [[Mount Tamalpais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonic.net/~ckelly/Seekay/clunker.htm |title=Clunkers Among the Hills |publisher=Sonic.net |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mountain biking takes place on dirt roads, trails and in purpose-built parks. Downhill mountain biking has just evolved in the recent years and is performed at places such as Whistler Mountain Bike Park. Slopestyle, a form of downhill, is when riders do tricks such as tailwhips, 360s, backflips and front flips.
There are several disciplines of mountain biking besides downhill. Cross country, often referred to as XC, all mountain, trail, free ride, and newly popular enduro.

====Other====
The [[Marching and Cycling Band HHK]] from [[Haarlem]] (the Netherlands) is one of the few marching bands around the world which also performs on bicycles.

===Racing===

{{Main article|Cycle sport}}
Shortly after the introduction of bicycles, competitions developed independently in many parts of the world. Early races involving [[Boneshaker (bicycle)|boneshaker]] style bicycles were predictably fraught with injuries. Large races became popular during the 1890s "Golden Age of Cycling", with events across Europe, and in the U.S. and Japan as well. At one point, almost every major city in the US had a [[velodrome]] or two for [[Track cycling|track racing]] events, however since the middle of the 20th century cycling has become a minority sport in the US whilst in Continental Europe it continues to be a major sport, particularly in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. The most famous of all bicycle races is the [[Tour de France]]. This began in 1903, and continues to capture the attention of the sporting world.

In 1899, [[Charles Minthorn Murphy]] became the first man to ride his bicycle a mile in under a minute (hence his nickname, Mile-a-Minute Murphy), which he did by drafting a [[locomotive]] at [[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Long Island]].

As the bicycle evolved its various forms, different racing formats developed. Road races may involve both team and individual competition, and are contested in various ways. They range from the one-day road race, [[criterium]], and time trial to multi-stage events like the Tour de France and its sister events which make up cycling's [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. [[Recumbent bicycle]]s were banned from bike races in 1934 after Marcel Berthet set a new [[hour record]] in his ''Velodyne streamliner'' (49.992&amp;nbsp;km on November 18, 1933). [[Track bicycle]]s are used for [[track cycling]] in [[Velodrome]]s, while [[cyclo-cross]] races are held on outdoor terrain, including pavement, grass, and mud. Cyclocross races feature man-made features such as small barriers which riders either [[Bunny hop (cycling)|bunny hop]] over or dismount and walk over. [[Individual time trial|Time trial]] races, another form of road racing require a rider to ride against the clock. Time trials can be performed as a team or as a single rider. Bikes are changed for time trial races, using [[aero bars]]. In the past decade, [[mountain biking|mountain bike racing]] has also reached international popularity and is even an Olympic sport.

Professional racing organizations place limitations on the bicycles that can be used in the races that they sanction. For example, the Union Cycliste Internationale, the governing body of international cycle sport (which sanctions races such as the Tour de France), decided in the late 1990s to create additional rules which prohibit racing bicycles weighing less than 6.8 kilograms (14.96 pounds). The UCI rules also effectively ban some [[bicycle frame]] innovations (such as the [[recumbent bicycle]]) by requiring a double triangle structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldsite.uci.ch/english/about/rules/ch01_general.pdf |format=PDF|title=UCI Cycling Regulations |accessdate=2006-08-04 |author=Union Cycliste International |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War===
{{Main article|Bicycle infantry}}
The bicycle has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has taken over many of the functions of [[horses in warfare]]. In the [[Second Boer War]], both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand used bicycles to move troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan's [[Malayan Campaign|march or "roll" through Malaya]] in [[World War II]]. Germany used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed airborne "Cycle-commandos" with [[folding bike]]s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], communist forces used bicycles extensively as cargo carriers along the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].

The last country known to maintain a regiment of bicycle troops was Switzerland, which disbanded its last unit in 2003.

==Activism==
Two broad and correlated themes run in bicycle activism: one is about advocating the bicycle as an alternative mode of transport, and the other is about the creation of conditions to permit and/or encourage bicycle use, both for utility and recreational cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility |url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1899_reg.html |last=Furness |first=Zack |year=2010 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-1-59213-613-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first, which emphasizes the potential for energy and resource conservation and health benefits gained from cycling versus automobile use, is relatively undisputed, the second is the subject of much debate.

[[File:Critical Mass, San Francisco, April 29, 2005.jpg|thumb|San Francisco [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]], April 29, 2005.|alt=Many cyclists on a road, all going in the same direction.]]

It is generally agreed that improved local and [[inter-city rail]] services and other methods of mass transportation (including greater provision for cycle carriage on such services) create conditions to encourage bicycle use. However, there are different opinions on the role of various types of [[cycling infrastructure]] in building [[bicycle-friendly]] cities and roads.

Some bicycle activists (including some traffic management advisers) seek the construction of [[bike path]]s, [[cycle track]]s and [[bike lane]]s for journeys of all lengths and point to their success in promoting [[bike safety|safety]] and encouraging more people to cycle. Some activists, especially those from the [[vehicular cycling]] tradition, view the safety, practicality, and intent of such facilities with suspicion. They favor a more holistic approach based on [[Traffic psychology#Accident prevention and improvement of traffic safety|the 4 'E's]]; ''education'' (of everyone involved), ''encouragement'' (to apply the education), ''enforcement'' (to protect the rights of others), and ''engineering'' (to facilitate travel while respecting every person's equal right to do so). Some groups offer [[Vehicular cycling#Education|training courses]] to help cyclists integrate themselves with other traffic.

[[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] is an event typically held on the last Friday of every month in [[city|cities]] around the world where bicyclists take to the streets ''en masse''. While the ride was founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists, the leaderless structure of Critical Mass makes it impossible to assign it any one specific goal. In fact, the purpose of Critical Mass is not formalized beyond the [[direct action]] of meeting at a set location and time and traveling as a group through city streets.

There is a long-running [[Bicycle helmet#Opinions for and against the use of helmets|cycle helmet debate]] among activists. The most heated controversy surrounds the topic of [[Bicycle helmet#Legislation and culture|compulsory helmet use]].

==Associations==
[[File:World Cycling Centre - Aigle Switzerland.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] in Switzerland]]
Cyclists form associations, both for specific interests (trails development, road maintenance, bike maintenance, urban design, racing clubs, touring clubs, etc.) and for more global goals ([[energy conservation]], pollution reduction, promotion of fitness). Some bicycle clubs and national associations became prominent advocates for improvements to roads and highways. In the United States, the [[League of American Wheelmen]] lobbied for the improvement of roads in the last part of the 19th century, founding and leading the national [[Good Roads Movement]]. Their model for political organization, as well as the paved roads for which they argued, facilitated the growth of the automobile.

As a sport, cycling is governed internationally by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] in Switzerland, [[USA Cycling]] (merged with the United States Cycling Federation in 1995) in the United States, (for [[upright bicycle]]s) and by the [[International Human Powered Vehicle Association]] (for other HPVs, or human-powered vehicles). Cycling for transport and touring is promoted on a European level by the [[European Cyclists' Federation]], with associated members from Great Britain, Japan and elsewhere. Regular conferences on cycling as transport are held under the auspices of [[Velo City]]; global conferences are coordinated by Velo Mondial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Health effects==

The health benefits of cycling outweigh the risks, when cycling is compared to a sedentary lifestyle. A Dutch study found that cycling can extend lifespans by up to 14 months, but the risks equated to a reduced lifespan of 40 days or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=2920084 |doi=10.1289/ehp.0901747 |pmid=20587380 |year=2010 |author1=De Hartog |first1=J.

===Exercise===

The [[physical exercise]] gained from cycling is generally linked with increased health and well-being. According to the [[World Health Organization]], physical inactivity is second only to [[tobacco smoking]] as a health risk in developed countries,&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e75662.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Physically Active Life through Everyday Transport |publisher=World health Organisation|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is associated with many tens of billions of dollars of healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/economic_consequences.htm|title=Overweight and Obesity: Economic Consequences|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's report&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; suggests that increasing physical activity is a public health 'best buy', and that cycling is a 'highly suitable activity' for this purpose. The charity [[Sustrans]] reports that investment in cycling provision can give a 20:1 return from health and other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1158137684156|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312033043/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/default.asp?sID=1158137684156|archivedate=2007-03-12|title=How transport can save the NHS|publisher=sustrans.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that, on average, approximately 20 life-years are gained from the health benefits of road bicycling for every life-year lost through injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author3=British Medical Association |first1=Mayhew |last1=Hillman |first2=David |last2=Morgan |title=Cycling: Towards Health and Safety|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-286151-4|year=1992}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles are often used by people seeking to improve their fitness and cardiovascular health. In this regard, cycling is especially helpful for those with [[arthritis]] of the lower limbs who are unable to pursue sports that cause impact to the knees and other joints. Since cycling can be used for the practical purpose of transportation, there can be less need for self-discipline to exercise.

Cycling while seated is a relatively non-[[weight bearing]] exercise that, like [[Human swimming#As recreation and exercise|swimming]], does little to promote bone density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00198-003-1418-z |pmid=12856112 |title=Low bone mineral density in highly trained male master cyclists |journal=Osteoporosis International |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=644–9 |year=2003 |last1=Palmer |first1=Jacob E. |last2=Levy |first2=Susan S. |last3=Nichols |first3=Jeanne F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cycling up and out of the saddle, on the other hand, does a better job by transferring more of the rider's body weight to the legs. However, excessive cycling while standing can cause knee damage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldonbrown.com/pain.html#knees|title=Bicycling and Pain|accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2011}} It used to be thought that cycling while standing was less energy efficient, but recent research has proven this not to be true. Other than air resistance, there is no wasted energy from cycling while standing, if it is done correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/?pg=fullstory&amp;id=4512| title=Sit or Stand: Tradeoffs in Efficiency?| publisher=PEZ Cycling News | date=November 21, 2006 | accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cycling on a [[stationary cycle]] is frequently advocated as a suitable exercise for rehabilitation, particularly for lower limb injury, owing to the low impact which it has on the joints. In particular, cycling is commonly used within knee rehabilitation programs.

As a response to the increased global sedentarity and consequent overweight and [[obesity]], one response that has been adopted by many organizations concerned with health and environment is the promotion of [[Active travel]], which seeks to promote walking and cycling as safe and attractive alternatives to motorized transport. Given that many journeys are for relatively short distances, there is considerable scope to replace car use with walking or cycling, though in many settings this may require some infrastructure modification, particularly to attract the less experienced and confident.

Cycling suffers from a perception that it is unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On Your Bike! |first=Matt |last=Seaton |page=103 |year=2006 |publisher=[[Black Dog Publishing]] |location=London |isbn=1-904772-40-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horton, D. (2007) Fear of Cycling. In p. Rosen, P. Cox, Horton, D. Cycling and Society. London: Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; This perception is not always backed by hard numbers, because of under reporting of accidents and lack of bicycle use data (amount of cycling, kilometers cycled) which make it hard to assess the [[risk]] and monitor changes in risks.&lt;ref name="Vanparijs"&gt;{{cite journal

In the UK, fatality rates per mile or kilometre are slightly less than those for walking.&lt;ref name="UK fatalities by mode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/adobepdf/162469/221412/221549/227755/rcgb2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Road Casualties Great Britain 2007&amp;nbsp;– Annual Report (page 82, "Fatality rates by mode of travel")|publisher=Department for Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, bicycling fatality rates are less than 2/3 of those walking the same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_statistics_annual_report/2004/html/chapter_02/daily_travel_by_walking_and_bicycling.html|title=Daily Travel by Walking and Bicycling|publisher=Bureau of Transportation Statistics|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/|title=Fatality Analysis Reporting System|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the UK for example the fatality and serious injury rates ''per hour of travel'' are just over double for cycling than those for walking.&lt;ref name="UK fatalities by mode" /&gt; Thus if a person is, for example, about to undertake a ten kilometre journey to a given destination it may on average be safer to undertake this journey by bicycle than on foot. However, if a person is intending, for example, to undertake an hour's exercise it may be more dangerous to take that exercise by cycling rather than by walking.

Despite the risk factors associated with bicycling, cyclists have a lower overall mortality rate when compared to other groups. A Danish study in 2000 found that even after adjustment for other risk factors, including leisure time physical activity, those who did not cycle to work experienced a 39% higher mortality rate than those who did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinte.160.11.1621 |pmid=10847255 |title=All-Cause Mortality Associated with Physical Activity During Leisure Time, Work, Sports, and Cycling to Work |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=160 |issue=11 |pages=1621–8 |year=2000 |last1=Andersen |first1=Lars Bo |last2=Schnohr |first2=Peter |last3=Schroll |first3=Marianne |last4=Hein |first4=Hans Ole }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries (to cyclists, from cycling) can be divided into two types:
* [[Physical trauma]] (extrinsic)
* Overuse (intrinsic).

====Physical trauma====
[[Acute (medical)|Acute]] physical trauma includes injuries to the head and extremities resulting from falls and collisions. Most cycle deaths result from a collision with a car or heavy goods vehicle, both motorist and cyclist having been found responsible for collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/articles/cyclingingreatbritain1|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100304011242/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/articles/cyclingingreatbritain1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-03-04|title=Cycling in Great Britain|publisher=Department of Transport|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camcycle.org.uk/newsletters/53/article4.html|title=44 tonne articulated trucks and towns don't mix|publisher=Cambridge Cycling Campaign UK|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://showcase.commedia.org.uk/article/articleview/390/1/13/ |title=Lorries and Towns Don't Mix (video) |publisher=Robert Webb |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123033954/http://showcase.commedia.org.uk/article/articleview/390/1/13/ |archivedate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third of collisions between motorists and cyclists are caused by [[car dooring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Gavin |date=12 July 2011 |title=Cycling for Dummies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNP53v7qNewC&amp;pg=PA16 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |page=161 |isbn=978-0-7303-7666-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, around 16% of serious cyclist injuries reported to police in the UK in 2014 did not involve any other person or vehicle.&lt;ref name="ROSPA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rospa.com/road-safety/advice/pedal-cyclists/facts-figures/| title =Cycling Accidents Facts &amp; Figures - August 2014|accessdate=2016-11-26|website =www.rospa.com|publisher=The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a majority of bicycle collisions occur during the day,&lt;ref name="ROSPA"/&gt; [[Bicycle lighting#Safety|bicycle lighting]] is recommended for [[bicycle safety|safety when bicycling]] at night to increase visibility.&lt;ref name="NHSTA"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/pdf/812202-CountermeasuresThatWork8th.pdf | title = National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

====Overuse injuries====
Of a study of 518 cyclists, a large majority reported at least one overuse injury, with over one third requiring medical treatment. The most common injury sites were the neck (48.8%) and the knees (41.7%), as well as the groin/buttocks (36.1%), hands (31.1%), and back (30.3%). Women were more likely to suffer from neck and shoulder pain than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-2007-972992 |pmid=7649713 |title=An Epidemiological Analysis of Overuse Injuries Among Recreational Cyclists |journal=International Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=201–6 |year=2007 |last1=Wilber |first1=C. |last2=Holland |first2=G. |last3=Madison |first3=R. |last4=Loy |first4=S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cyclists suffer from overuse injuries to the knees, affecting cyclists at all levels. These are caused by many factors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.biomech.com/db_area/archives/1996/9607sports.bio.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070212/http://www.biomech.com/db_area/archives/1996/9607sports.bio.html | archivedate=2007-09-28 | title=Knee Pain in Cycling: New Twist on an old Injury | publisher=BioMechanics | date=July–August 1996 | accessdate=2006-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Incorrect bicycle fit or adjustment, particularly the saddle.
*Incorrect adjustment of clipless pedals.
*Too many hills, or too many miles, too early in the training season.
*Poor training preparation for long touring rides.
*Selecting too high a gear. A lower gear for uphill climb protects the knees, even though muscles may be well able to handle a higher gear.

Overuse injuries, including chronic nerve damage at weight bearing locations, can occur as a result of repeatedly riding a bicycle for extended periods of time. Damage to the [[ulnar nerve]] in the palm, [[carpal tunnel syndrome|carpal tunnel]] in the wrist, the genitourinary tract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2004.10.024 |pmid=15716187 |title=The Vicious Cycling: Bicycling Related Urogenital Disorders |journal=European Urology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=277–86; discussion 286–7 |year=2005 |last1=Leibovitch |first1=Ilan |last2=Mor |first2=Yoram }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[bicycle seat neuropathy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.emedicine.com/SPORTS/topic12.htm | title=Bicycle Seat Neuropathy, follow up | publisher=[[eMedicine]] | date=February 8, 2006 | accessdate=2006-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; may result from overuse. [[Recumbent bicycle]]s are designed on different [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] principles and eliminate pressure from the saddle and handlebars, due to the relaxed riding position.

Note that overuse is a relative term, and capacity varies greatly between individuals. Someone starting out in cycling must be careful to increase length and frequency of cycling sessions slowly, starting for example at an hour or two per day, or a hundred miles or kilometers per week. Bilateral muscular pain is a normal by-product of the training process, whereas unilateral pain may reveal "exercise-induced arterial endofibrosis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15233595 |year=2004 |author1=Abraham |first1=P. |title=Past, present and future of arterial endofibrosis in athletes: A point of view |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=419–25 |last2=Bouyé |first2=P |last3=Quéré |first3=I |last4=Chevalier |first4=J. M. |last5=Saumet |first5=J. L. |doi=10.2165/00007256-200434070-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint pain and numbness are also early signs of overuse injury.

A Spanish study of top [[triathlete]]s found those who cover more than 186 miles (300&amp;nbsp;km) a week on their bikes have less than 4% normal looking [[sperm]], where normal adult males would be expected to have from 15% to 20%.&lt;ref name="bmj.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkinson |first=Emma |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8124458.stm |title=BBC: Elite cyclists 'risk infertility' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saddle related ====
Much work has been done to investigate optimal [[bicycle saddle]] shape, size and position, and negative effects of extended use of less than optimal seats or configurations.

Excessive saddle height can cause [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] knee pain, while setting the saddle too low can cause pain in the [[anterior]] of the knee. An incorrectly fitted saddle may eventually lead to muscle imbalance. A 25 to 35 degree knee angle is recommended to avoid an overuse injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nationalpti.edu/blog/2015/07/avoiding-repetitive-knee-injuries-while-riding-a-bike/ | title=Avoid Repetitive Knee Injuries While Riding A Bike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cycling has been linked to sexual impotence due to pressure on the perineum from the seat, but fitting a proper sized seat prevents this effect.&lt;ref name="bmj.com"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.g425 |pmid=24524928 |pmc=3923979 |title=Health effects of the London bicycle sharing system: Health impact modelling study |journal=BMJ |volume=348 |pages=g425 |year=2014 |last1=Woodcock |first1=J. |last2=Tainio |first2=M. |last3=Cheshire |first3=J. |last4=O'Brien |first4=O. |last5=Goodman |first5=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/149268.stm|title=Cycle of despair|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-29|date=1998-08-12}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/363070.stm|title=Cycling linked to impotence|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-09-29|date=1999-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="no nose"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.00867.x |pmid=18466268 |title=Cutting off the Nose to Save the Penis |journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=1932–40 |year=2008 |last1=Schrader |first1=Steven M. |last2=Breitenstein |first2=Michael J. |last3=Lowe |first3=Brian D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, [[pudendal nerve entrapment]] can be a source of intractable perineal pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00002060-200306000-00013 |year=2003 |last1=Ramsden |first1=Christopher |journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=479–484 |last2=McDaniel |first2=Michael |last3=Harmon |first3=Robert |last4=Renney |first4=Kenneth |last5=Faure |first5=Alexis |pmid=12820792 |title=Pudendal nerve entrapment as source of intractable perineal pain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cyclists with induced pudendal nerve pressure neuropathy gained relief from improvements in saddle position and riding techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1821826 |year=1991 |author1=Silbert |first1=P. L. |title=Bicycling induced pudendal nerve pressure neuropathy |journal=Clinical and experimental neurology |volume=28 |pages=191–6 |last2=Dunne |first2=J. W. |last3=Edis |first3=R. H. |last4=Stewart-Wynne |first4=E. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has investigated the potential health effects of prolonged bicycling in police bicycle patrol units, including the possibility that some bicycle saddles exert excessive pressure on the urogenital area of cyclists, restricting blood flow to the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bike/ |title=NIOSH -Bicycle Saddles and Reproductive Health |accessdate=2007-10-10|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study found that using bicycle seats without protruding noses reduced pressure on the groin by at least 65% and significantly reduced the number of cases of urogenital paresthesia. A follow-up found that 90% of bicycle officers who tried the no-nose seat were using it six months later. NIOSH recommends that riders use a no-nose bicycle seat for workplace bicycling.&lt;ref name ="no nose" /&gt;&lt;ref name="impact niosh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-163/|title=NIOSH Research Demonstrates the Effectiveness of No-Nose Bicycle Seats in Reducing Groin Pressure and Improving Sexual Health (2010-163)|publisher=CDC – The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite rumors to the contrary, there is no [[scientific evidence]] linking cycling with [[testicular cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/library/TesticlarCancerFactSheet.pdf|format=PDF|title=Testiclar Cancer Fact Sheet|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=Monash Institute of Medical Research|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003171048/http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/library/TesticlarCancerFactSheet.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exposure to air pollution====
One concern is that riding in traffic may expose the cyclist to higher levels of air pollution, especially if he or she travels on or along busy roads. Some authors have claimed this to be untrue, showing that the pollutant and irritant count within cars is consistently higher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/HE04063 |last1=Chertok |first1=Michael |last2=Voukelatos |first2=Alexander |last3=Sheppeard |first3=Vicky |last4=Rissel |first4=Chris |year=2004 |title=Comparison of air pollution exposure for five commuting modes in Sydney - car, train, bus, bicycle and walking |journal=Health Promotion Journal of Australia |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=63–7 |url=http://vadebike.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/Comparison-of-air-pollution-exposure-for-five-commuting-modes-in-Sydney-car-train-bus-bicycle-and-walking-HPJA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because of limited circulation of air within the car and due to the air intake being directly in the stream of other traffic. Other authors have found small or inconsistent differences in concentrations but claim that exposure of cyclists is higher due to increased minute [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2010.04.028 |title=Exposure to particulate matter in traffic: A comparison of cyclists and car passengers |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=44 |issue=19 |pages=2263–2270 |year=2010 |last1=Int Panis |first1=Luc |last2=De Geus |first2=Bas |last3=Vandenbulcke |first3=Grégory |last4=Willems |first4=Hanny |last5=Degraeuwe |first5=Bart |last6=Bleux |first6=Nico |last7=Mishra |first7=Vinit |last8=Thomas |first8=Isabelle |last9=Meeusen |first9=Romain |bibcode=2010AtmEn..44.2263I }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with minor biological changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-9-64 |pmid=20973949 |pmc=2984475 |title=Subclinical responses in healthy cyclists briefly exposed to traffic-related air pollution: An intervention study |journal=Environmental Health |volume=9 |pages=64 |year=2010 |last1=Jacobs |first1=Lotte |last2=Nawrot |first2=Tim S |last3=De Geus |first3=Bas |last4=Meeusen |first4=Romain |last5=Degraeuwe |first5=Bart |last6=Bernard |first6=Alfred |last7=Sughis |first7=Muhammad |last8=Nemery |first8=Benoit |last9=Panis |first9=Luc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the associated health effect, if any, is unclear but probably much smaller than the health impacts associated with accidents and the health benefits derived from additional physical activity.

The '''''Declaration of Sports''''' (also known as the '''''Book of Sports''''') was a declaration of [[James I of England]] issued just for [[Lancashire]] in 1617, nationally in 1618, and reissued by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1633. It listed the sports and recreations that were permitted on Sundays and other [[Liturgical year|holy days]].

==Issue under James I==
It was originally issued in consultation with [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]], [[bishop]] of [[Chester]], to resolve a dispute in [[Lancashire]] between the [[Puritan]]s and the [[gentry]] (many of whom were [[Roman Catholic]]s).  The initial declaration was just for [[Lancashire]], but in 1618, James made the declaration national. The 1618 declaration has largely the same main text as the 1617 version, but with an additional paragraph at the beginning explaining that the king has decided to make the declaration applicable to the whole of England.

The declaration listed [[archery]], [[historical dance|dancing]], "leaping, vaulting, or any other such harmless recreation" as permissible sports, together with "May-games, [[Whitsun Ale|Whitsun-ales]] and [[Morris dance|Morris-dances]], and the setting up of [[Maypole|May-poles]]". Also allowed: "women shall have leave to [[rushbearing|carry rushes]] to the church for the decorating of it, according to their old custom."

Amongst the activities that were prohibited were [[bear-baiting|bear-]] and [[bull-baiting]], "interludes" and [[bowls|bowling]].

On the one hand, the declaration rebuked Puritans and other "precise persons", and was issued to counteract the growing Puritan calls for strict abstinence on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian Sabbath]] ([[Sunday Sabbatarianism|Sabbatarianism]]). On the other, it condemned Catholics and others who did not attend church services in their [[parish]], as the declaration specified that only people who had first attended divine service were entitled to participate in recreations afterward.

==Re-issue under Charles I==
The declaration was reissued by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] on 18 October 1633, as ''The King's Majesty's declaration to his subjects concerning lawful sports to be used''.  It was claimed by [[William Prynne]] that the new declaration was written by Charles' new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Laud]], but Laud denied this and there is only evidence that he supported and facilitated the reissue.&lt;ref&gt;Craigie, ''Minor Prose Works of James VI and James I'', pp. 227–28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the 1633 declaration has the same main text as the 1617 and 1618 declarations of King James, with the primary differences an additional introduction and conclusion adding wakes and ales (countryside festivals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What does ale mean? | publisher = Dictionary.net | url = http://definitions.dictionary.net/ale | accessdate = 19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to the list of sanctioned recreations. Charles ordered that any minister who refused to read it would be deprived of position.  As the Puritans gained power in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in the lead-up to the [[English Civil War]], hostility to the ''Book of Sports'' grew.  Attempts to enforce the declaration came to an end with the fall of Archbishop Laud in 1640, and Parliament ordered the [[book burning|book publicly burned]] in 1643, two years before Laud was executed.

 NOTE TO POTENTIAL EDITORS: "Defence" is the correct spelling of the word in British English, and should be maintained throughout the article, as it is used as such in the title. Please do not change "defence" to the American English spelling, "defense", as this goes against WP:LANGVAR. See also WP:RETAIN / WP:CONSISTENCY and MOS:QUOTE.

A '''defence mechanism''' is an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] psychological mechanism that reduces anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |title=Psychology Second Edition |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=41 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010 |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2 |pages=482–483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defence mechanisms may result in healthy or unhealthy consequences depending on the circumstances and frequency with which the mechanism is used.&lt;ref name=utah&gt;[http://www.utahpsych.org/defensemechanisms.htm Utah Psych.

Healthy persons normally use different defences throughout life. An [[Human ego|ego]] defence mechanism becomes pathological only when its persistent use leads to maladaptive behaviour such that the physical or mental health of the individual is adversely affected. Among the purposes of ego defence mechanisms is to protect the mind/self/ego from [[anxiety]] or social sanctions or to provide a refuge from a situation with which one cannot currently cope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029737/defence-mechanism |title=defence mechanisms --  Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=www.britannica.com |accessdate=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One resource used to evaluate these mechanisms is the ''Defense Style Questionnaire'' (DSQ-40).&lt;ref name="pmid16477187"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruuttu T, Pelkonen M, Holi M |title=Psychometric properties of the defense style questionnaire (DSQ-40) in adolescents |journal=J.

== Structural model: Id, ego, and superego ==
[[File:Freud 420a.jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud]]
The concept of id impulses comes from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[structural model]]. According to this theory, [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] impulses are based on the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]: instant gratification of one's own desires and needs. Sigmund Freud believed that the id represents biological instinctual impulses in humans, such as aggression ([[Thanatos]] or the Death instinct) and sexuality ([[Eros (love)|Eros]] or the Life instinct).

For example, when the id impulses (e.g., desire to have sexual relations with a stranger) conflict with the [[superego]] (e.g., belief in societal conventions of not having sex with unknown persons), unsatisfied feelings of anxiousness or feelings of anxiety come to the surface. To reduce these unpleasant feelings, the ego might use defence mechanisms (conscious or unconscious blockage of the id impulses).

Freud believed that conflicts between these two structures resulted in conflicts associated with [[psychosexual stages]].

===Definitions of individual psyche structures===
[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|280px|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another.]]
Freud proposed three structures of the psyche or personality:
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|Id]]''': The id is the unconscious reservoir of the libido, the psychic energy that fuels instincts and psychic processes. It is a selfish, childish, pleasure-oriented part of the personality with no ability to delay gratification.
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Super-ego|Superego]]''':  The superego contains internalised societal and parental standards of "good" and "bad", "right" and "wrong" behaviour.  They include conscious appreciations of rules and regulations as well as those incorporated unconsciously.
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]''': The ego acts as a moderator between the pleasure sought by the id and the morals of the superego, seeking compromises to pacify both. It can be viewed as the individual's "sense of time and place".

===Primary and secondary processes===
In the ego, there are two ongoing processes. First, there is the unconscious primary process, where the thoughts are not organised in a coherent way; the feelings can shift, contradictions are not in conflict or are just not perceived that way, and [[Condensation (psychology)|condensations]] arise. There is no logic and no time line. [[Lust]] is important for this process. By contrast, there is the conscious secondary process, where strong [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] are set and thoughts must be organised in a coherent way. Most conscious thoughts originate here.

===The reality principle===

Id impulses are not appropriate in a civilised society, so there is societal pressure to modify the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in favour of the [[reality principle]]; that is, the requirements of the external world.

===Formation of the superego===

The superego forms as the child grows and learns parental and social standards. The superego consists of two structures: the [[conscience]], which stores information about what is "bad" and what has been punished, and the [[ego ideal]], which stores information about what is "good" and what one "should" do or be.

===The ego's use of defence mechanisms===

When [[anxiety]] becomes overwhelming, it is the ego's place to protect the person by employing defence mechanisms. [[guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[embarrassment]], and [[shame]] often accompany anxiety. In the first definitive book on defence mechanisms, ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"&gt;Freud, A. (1937). ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'', London: Hogarth Press and Institute of Psycho-Analysis. (Revised edition: 1966 (US), 1968 (UK))&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Freud]] introduced the concept of signal anxiety; she stated that it was "not directly a conflicted instinctual tension but a signal occurring in the ego of an anticipated instinctual tension".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"/&gt;

The signalling function of anxiety is thus seen as crucial, and biologically adapted to warn the organism of danger or a threat to its equilibrium. The anxiety is felt as an increase in bodily or mental tension, and the signal that the organism receives in this way allows for the possibility of taking defensive action regarding the perceived danger. Defence mechanisms work by distorting the id impulses into acceptable forms, or by unconscious or conscious blockage of these impulses.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"/&gt;

== Theories and classifications ==

The list of defence mechanisms, with no theoretical consensus on the exact number.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Classifying defence mechanisms according to some of their properties (like underlying mechanisms, similarities or connections with personality) has been attempted. Different theorists have different categorizations and conceptualizations of defence mechanisms. Large reviews of theories of defence mechanisms are available from Paulhus, Fridhandler and Hayes (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L., Fridhandler B., and Hayes S. (1997). Psychological defense: Contemporary theory and research. In {{cite book |author1=Briggs, Stephen |author2=Hogan, Robert Goode |author3=Johnson, John W. |title=Handbook of personality psychology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1997 |pages=543–579 |isbn=0-12-134646-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cramer (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, P. (1991). The Development of Defense Mechanisms: Theory, Research, and Assessment. New York, Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Personality'' published a special issue on defence mechanisms (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.1998.66.issue-6/issuetoc Special issue] [on defense mechanisms], ''Journal of Personality'' (1998), '''66''' (6): 879–1157&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, [[Anna Freud]] enumerated the ten defence mechanisms that appear in the works of her father, [[Sigmund Freud]]: 1. [[Psychological repression|Repression]], 2. [[Regression (psychology)|Regression]], 3. [[Reaction formation]], 4. [[Isolation (psychology)|Isolation]], 5. [[Undoing (psychology)|Undoing]], 6. [[Psychological projection|Projection]], 7. [[Introjection]], 8. [[self-harm|Turning against one's own person]], 9. Reversal into the opposite, 10. [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]] or [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref name="Szondi1956"&gt;Lipot Szondi (1956) [http://www.szondiforum.org/II.%20Szondi%20Ego%20Defenses%20and%20Sublimination.pdf ''Ego Analysis''] Ch. XIX, translated by Arthur C. Johnston, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Freuds studied defence mechanisms, but Anna spent more of her time and research on five main mechanisms: repression, regression, projection, reaction formation, and sublimation. All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious handle the stress of a social situation.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"&gt;Hock, Roger R. "Reading 30: You're Getting Defensive Again!" Forty Studies That Changed Psychology. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2013. 233–38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Repression''': when a feeling is hidden and forced from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable.
*'''Regression''': falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as "less demanding and safer".&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Projection''': possessing a feeling that is deigned as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or "unconscious urge" is seen in the actions of other people.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Reaction formation''': acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, "often exaggerated and obsessive". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to – rather than cheat – become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Sublimation''': seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;

[[Otto F. Kernberg]] (1967) developed a theory of borderline personality organization of which one consequence may be [[borderline personality disorder]]. His theory is based on ego psychological [[object relations theory]]. Borderline personality organization develops when the child cannot integrate helpful and harmful mental objects together. Kernberg views the use of primitive defence mechanisms as central to this personality organization. Primitive psychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and they are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and projective identification are seen as borderline defences.&lt;ref name="pmid4861171"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kernberg O |title=Borderline personality organization |journal=J Am Psychoanal Assoc |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=641–85 |date=July 1967 |pmid=4861171 |doi= 10.1177/000306516701500309|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Eman Vaillant]]'s (1977) categorization, defences form a continuum related to their [[Developmental stage theories|psychoanalytical developmental level]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vaillant, George E. |title=Adaptation to life |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-316-89520-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=June 2013}} They are classified into pathological, immature, neurotic and "mature" defences.

[[Robert Plutchik]]'s (1979) theory views defences as derivatives of basic [[emotions]], which in turn relate to particular diagnostic structures.  According to his theory, reaction formation relates to joy (and manic features), denial relates to acceptance (and histrionic features), repression to fear (and passivity), regression to surprise (and borderline traits), compensation to sadness (and depression), projection to disgust (and paranoia), displacement to anger (and hostility) and intellectualization to anticipation (and obsessionality).&lt;ref&gt;Plutchik, R., Kellerman, H., &amp; Conte, H. R. (1979). A structural theory of ego defences and emotions. In C. E. Izard (Ed.), Emotions in personality and psychopathology (pp. 229–-257). New
York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ([[DSM-IV]])'' published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (1994) includes a tentative diagnostic axis for defence mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is largely based on Vaillant's hierarchical view of defences, but has some modifications. Examples include: denial, fantasy, rationalization, regression, isolation, projection, and displacement.

== Vaillant's categorization ==
{{Refimprove section |date=June 2013}}
Psychiatrist [[George Eman Vaillant]] introduced a four-level classification of defence mechanisms:&lt;ref name="Cramer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protecting the Self|last=Cramer|first=Phebe|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=May 2006|isbn=9781593855284|location=|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNsmzy-lLagC&amp;pg=PA17 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Level I – pathological defences (psychotic denial, delusional projection)
*Level II – immature defences (fantasy, projection, passive aggression, acting out)
*Level III – neurotic defences (intellectualization, reaction formation, dissociation, displacement, repression)
*Level IV – mature defences (humour, sublimation, suppression, altruism, anticipation)

===Level 1: "Psychotic"===
When predominant, the mechanisms on this level are almost always severely [[Psychopathology|pathological]].  These six defences, in conjunction, permit one effectively to rearrange external experiences to eliminate the need to cope with reality.  Pathological users of these mechanisms frequently appear irrational or [[Insanity|insane]] to others. These are the "psychotic" defences, common in overt [[psychosis]].  However, they are normally found in [[dream]]s and throughout childhood as well.&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"&gt;Vaillant, G. E., Bond, M., &amp; Vaillant, C. O. (1986). An empirically validated hierarchy of defence mechanisms. Archives of General Psychiatry, 73, 786–794. George Eman Valillant&lt;/ref&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Delusion|Delusional projection]]''': Delusions about external reality, usually of a persecutory nature.
*'''[[Denial]]''': Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening; arguing against an anxiety-provoking stimulus by stating it doesn't exist; resolution of emotional conflict and reduction of anxiety by refusing to perceive or consciously acknowledge the more unpleasant aspects of external reality.
*'''[[Cognitive distortion|Distortion]]''': A gross reshaping of external reality to meet internal needs.

===Level 2: Immature===
These mechanisms are often present in adults. These mechanisms lessen distress and anxiety produced by threatening people or by an uncomfortable reality.  Excessive use of such defences is seen as socially undesirable, in that they are immature, difficult to deal with and seriously out of touch with reality.  These are the so-called "immature" defences and overuse almost always leads to serious problems in a person's ability to cope effectively.  These defences are often seen in [[major depression]] and [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Acting out]]''': Direct expression of an unconscious wish or impulse in action, without conscious awareness of the emotion that drives the expressive behavior.
*'''[[Hypochondriasis]]''': An excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness.
*'''[[Passive-aggressive behavior]]''': Indirect expression of hostility
*'''[[Psychological projection|Projection]]''': A primitive form of [[paranoia]]. Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the undesirable impulses or desires without becoming consciously aware of them; attributing one's own unacknowledged, unacceptable, or unwanted thoughts and emotions to another; includes severe [[prejudice]] and [[Envy|jealousy]], [[hypervigilance]] to external danger, and "injustice collecting", all with the aim of shifting one's unacceptable thoughts, feelings and impulses onto someone else, such that those same thoughts, feelings, beliefs and motivations are perceived as being possessed by the other.
*'''[[Fantasy (psychology)|Schizoid fantasy]]''': Tendency to retreat into fantasy in order to resolve inner and outer conflicts.

===Level 3: Neurotic===
These mechanisms are considered [[neurosis|neurotic]], but fairly common in adults. Such defences have short-term advantages in coping, but can often cause long-term problems in relationships, work and in enjoying life when used as one's primary style of coping with the world.&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Displacement (psychology)|Displacement]]''': defence mechanism that shifts sexual or aggressive impulses to a more acceptable or less threatening target; redirecting emotion to a safer outlet; separation of emotion from its real object and redirection of the intense emotion toward someone or something that is less offensive or threatening in order to avoid dealing directly with what is frightening or threatening.  For example, a parent may yell at their child because they are angry with their spouse.
*'''[[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociation]]''': Temporary drastic modification of one's personal identity or character to avoid emotional distress; separation or postponement of a feeling that normally would accompany a situation or thought.
*'''[[Intellectualization]]''': A form of isolation; concentrating on the intellectual components of a situation so as to distance oneself from the associated anxiety-provoking emotions; separation of emotion from ideas; thinking about wishes in formal, affectively bland terms and not acting on them; avoiding unacceptable emotions by focusing on the intellectual aspects ([[Solitude|isolation]], [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]], [[ritual]], [[Undoing (psychology)|undoing]], [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]], and [[magical thinking]]).
*'''[[Reaction formation]]''': Converting unconscious wishes or impulses that are perceived to be dangerous or unacceptable into their opposites; behaviour that is completely the opposite of what one really wants or feels; taking the opposite belief because the true belief causes anxiety.
*'''[[Psychological repression|Repression]]''': The process of attempting to repel desires towards pleasurable instincts, caused by a threat of suffering if the desire is satisfied; the desire is moved to the unconscious in the attempt to prevent it from entering consciousness;&lt;ref name="LaplancheP390"&gt;Laplanche pp. 390, 392{{Full citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; seemingly unexplainable naivety, memory lapse or lack of awareness of one's own situation and condition; the emotion is conscious, but the idea behind it is absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.vcu.edu/home/resources/pipc/Other/Personality/Table_Defenses.pdf Psychological Defenses from DSM-IV (see Repression)], Virginia Commonwealth University. Retrieved on December 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level 4: Mature===
These are commonly found among emotionally healthy adults and are considered mature, even though many have their origins in an immature stage of development. They have been adapted through the years in order to optimise success in human society and relationships. The use of these defences enhances pleasure and feelings of control. These defences help to integrate conflicting emotions and thoughts, whilst still remaining effective.  Those who use these mechanisms are usually considered [[virtue|virtuous]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
Mature defences include:
*'''[[Altruism]]''': Constructive service to others that brings pleasure and personal satisfaction.
*'''[[Anticipation (emotion)|Anticipation]]''': Realistic planning for future discomfort.
*'''[[Humour]]''': Overt expression of ideas and feelings (especially those that are unpleasant to focus on or too terrible to talk about directly) that gives pleasure to others. The thoughts retain a portion of their innate distress, but they are "skirted around" by witticism, for example [[self-deprecation]].
*'''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]''': Transformation of unhelpful emotions or instincts into healthy actions, behaviours, or emotions, for example, playing a heavy contact sport such as football or rugby can transform aggression into a game.&lt;ref name="autogenerated483"&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner (2011), ''Psychology'' (2nd edition), Worth Publishers, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Thought suppression|Suppression]]''': The conscious decision to delay paying attention to a thought, emotion, or need in order to cope with the present reality; making it possible later to access uncomfortable or distressing emotions whilst accepting them.

[[File:Ego defence mechanisms.JPG|thumb|right|Diagram of selected ego defence mechanisms]]

=== Pathological ===
*'''[[Conversion syndrome|Conversion]]''': The expression of an intrapsychic conflict as a physical symptom; some examples include blindness, deafness, paralysis, or numbness. This phenomenon is sometimes called ''hysteria''.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Neil R.. "Chapter 14." Psychology: the science of behaviour. Fourth Canadian Edition ed. Toronto, Ont.: Pearson Education Canada Inc., 2010. 456. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]]''':  A primitive defence.  Both harmful and helpful impulses are split off and unintegrated, frequently projected onto someone else.  The defended individual segregates experiences into all-good and all-bad categories, with no room for ambiguity and ambivalence.  When "splitting" is combined with "projecting", the undesirable qualities that one unconsciously perceives oneself as possessing, one consciously attributes to another.&lt;ref name="McWilliams"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychoanalytic Diagnosis: Understanding Personality Structure in the Clinical Process, Second Edition|last=McWilliams|first=Nancy|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1609184940|location=New York, NY|pages=60,63,103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immature ===
*'''[[Idealization and devaluation|Idealization]]''': Tending to perceive another individual as having more desirable qualities than he or she may actually have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ny6wkHI9qUcC&amp;pg=PA238|title=Ego Mechanisms of Defense: A Guide for Clinicians and Researchers|last=Vaillant|first=George Eman|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=1992|isbn=0-88048-404-7|page=238|authorlink=George Eman Vaillant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Introjection]]''': Identifying with some idea or object so deeply that it becomes a part of that person. For example, introjection occurs when we take on attributes of other people who seem better able to cope with the situation than we do.
*'''[[Passive–aggressive behaviour|Passive aggression]]''': Aggression towards others expressed indirectly or passively, often through [[procrastination]].
*'''[[Projective identification]]''': The object of [[Psychological projection|projection]] invokes in that person a version of the thoughts, feelings or behaviours projected.
*'''[[Somatization]]''': The transformation of uncomfortable feelings towards others into uncomfortable feelings toward oneself: pain, illness, and anxiety.
*'''[[Wishful thinking]]''': Making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine instead of by appealing to evidence, rationality, or reality.

=== Neurotic ===
*'''[[Isolation (psychology)|Isolation]]''': Separation of feelings from ideas and events, for example, describing a murder with graphic details with no emotional response.
*'''[[Rationalization (making excuses)]]''': Convincing oneself that no wrong has been done and that all is or was all right through faulty and false reasoning. An indicator of this defence mechanism can be seen socially as the formulation of convenient excuses.
*'''[[Regression (psychology)|Regression]]''': Temporary reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more adult way, for example, using whining as a method of communicating despite already having acquired the ability to speak with an appropriate level of maturity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated483" /&gt;  
*'''[[Undoing (psychology)|Undoing]]''':  A person tries to 'undo' an unhealthy, destructive or otherwise threatening thought by acting out the reverse of the unacceptable. Involves symbolically nullifying an unacceptable or guilt provoking thought, idea, or feeling by confession or atonement.
*'''[[Social comparison|Upward and downward social comparisons]]''': A defensive tendency that is used as a means of self-evaluation. Individuals will look to another individual or comparison group who are considered to be worse off in order to dissociate themselves from perceived similarities and to make themselves feel better about themselves or their personal situation.
*'''[[Solitude|Withdrawal]]''':  Withdrawal is a more severe form of defence. It entails removing oneself from events, stimuli, and interactions under the threat of being reminded of painful thoughts and feelings.

=== Mature ===
*'''[[Acceptance]]''': A person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a difficult or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest the path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and unchangeable, or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk.
*'''[[Courage]]''': The mental ability and willingness to confront conflicts, fear, pain, danger, uncertainty, despair, obstacles, vicissitudes or intimidation. Physical courage often extends lives, while moral courage preserves the ideals of justice and fairness.
*'''[[Emotion regulation|Emotional self-regulation]]''': The ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with the range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable. Emotional self-regulation refers to the processes people use to modify the type, intensity, duration, or expression of various emotions.
*'''[[Emotional resilience|Emotional self-sufficiency]]''': Not being dependent on the validation (approval or disapproval) of others.
*'''[[Forgiveness]]''': Cessation of resentment, indignation or anger as a result of a perceived offence, disagreement, or mistake, or ceasing to demand retribution or restitution.
*'''[[Gratitude]]''': A feeling of thankfulness or appreciation involving appreciation of a wide range of people and events. Gratitude is likely to bring higher levels of happiness, and lower levels of depression and stress. Throughout history, gratitude has been given a central position in religious and philosophical theories.
*'''[[Humility]]''': A mechanism by which a person, considering their own defects, has a humble self-opinion. Humility is intelligent self-respect which keeps one from thinking too highly or too meanly of oneself.
*'''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]''': The unconscious modelling of one's self upon another person's character and behaviour.
*'''[[Mercy]]''': Compassionate behavior on the part of those in power.
*'''[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]]''': Adopting an orientation (characterized by curiosity, openness, and acceptance) toward one's experiences in the present moment.
*'''[[Moderation]]''': The process of eliminating or lessening extremes and staying within reasonable limits. It necessitates self-restraint which is imposed by oneself on one's own feelings, desires etc.
*'''[[Patience]]''': Enduring difficult circumstances (delay, provocation, criticism, attack etc.) for some time before responding negatively.
*'''[[Respect]]''': Willingness to show consideration or appreciation. Respect can be a specific feeling of regard for the actual qualities of a person or feeling being and also specific actions and conduct representative of that esteem. Relationships and contacts that are built without the presence of respect are seldom long term or sustainable. The lack of respect is at the very heart of most conflict in families, communities, and nations.
*'''[[Toleration|Tolerance]]''': The practice of deliberately allowing or permitting a thing of which one disapproves.

There are many different perspectives on how the construct of ''defence'' relates to the construct of ''[[Coping (psychology)|coping]]''; some writers differentiate the constructs in various ways, but "an important literature exists that does not make any difference between the two concepts".&lt;ref name="pmid19883526"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramer |first=Ueli |title=Coping and defence mechanisms: What's the difference? - Second act |journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice |volume=83 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=207–221 |date=June 2010 |pmid=19883526 |doi=10.1348/147608309X475989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one of his books, [[George Eman Vaillant]] stated that he "will use the terms ''adaptation'', ''resilience'', ''coping'', and ''defense'' interchangeably".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vaillant |first=George E. |authorlink=George Eman Vaillant |date=2012 |title=Triumphs of experience: the men of the Harvard Grant Study |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] of [[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=9780674059825 |oclc=792887462 |doi=10.4159/harvard.9780674067424 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=pPobx78zuj8C&amp;pg=PA262 262] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deradicalization''' refers to preventive [[counterterrorism]] measures that aim to have those with extreme and violent religious or political ideologies adopt more moderate and nonviolent views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deradicalization Definition und Bedeutung {{!}} Collins Wörterbuch|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/de/worterbuch/englisch/deradicalization|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=23 May 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=deradicalization - definition of deradicalization in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/deradicalization|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is most effective when counteracting an ongoing − rather than well advanced −{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} process of [[radicalization]] ('''counter-radicalization''') whereby individuals or groups gradually develop a mindset that increases the risk of [[violent extremism]] or [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name=chall&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deradicalization Programs and Counterterrorism :  A Perspective on the Challenges and Benefits|url=http://www.mei.edu/sites/default/files/Clutterbuck.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deradicalization is not to be confused with anti-radicalization in which radicalization is aimed to be deterred and prevented from occurring in the first place.&lt;ref name=chall/&gt; Deradicalization has been described as an emerging [[science]].&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koerner|first1=Brendan I.|title=A Judge May Send Men Guilty of Terrorism to Anti-Extremism Therapy Instead of Prison|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/11/u-s-judge-may-sentence-wannabe-terrorists-deradicalization/|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures and projects==
{{Expand section|date=May 2017}}
Google's think tank [[Jigsaw (company)|Jigsaw]] has been developing a new program − called the Redirect Method − in which Google's search advertising algorithms and YouTube's video platform are used to target aspiring [[ISIS]] recruits and ultimately dissuade them from joining the group.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Google’s Clever Plan to Stop Aspiring ISIS Recruits|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/09/googles-clever-plan-stop-aspiring-isis-recruits/|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Machine learning]] and [[scientific inquiry]] can be used to find the most effective contents (such as videos) for deradicalization, to learn why people leave terrorist movements and to identify aspiring violent radicals.

Humera Khan, executive director of the Islamic deradicalization group Muflehu, states that deradicalization also needs human interaction and a supportive community backing up the person's decision to turn away from extremism.&lt;ref name=google/&gt;

Renee Garfinkel also notes that personal relationships play a major role in the transformation of involvement in violence to non-violent activity, saying "change often hinges on a relationship with a mentor or friend who supports and affirms peaceful behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horgan|first1=John|title=Deradicalization or Disengagement?|url=http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/32/html|website=Perspectives on Terrorism|accessdate=23 May 2017|language=en|date=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nations and universities are engaging in deradicalization efforts.&lt;ref name=wash1/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koehler|first1=Daniel|title=The NYC Bombing Highlights Our Urgent Need for Deradicalization Programs|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-bombing-deradicalization-programs_us_57e00bfee4b04a1497b5a1d5|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=23 May 2017|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[religious education]] in schools could be replaced by more secular ethics education in which relevant issues could be debated, [[religious extremism]] reduced and young people deradicalized.

==Issues==
Companies, organizations and nations might use deradicalization as a pretext to spread their own [[propaganda]] or to &lt;!--sociopolitically--&gt;manipulate people with nonviolent views. Appropriate oversight, proper [[Supervised learning|training data]] for machine learning approaches and similar measures may mitigate such risks.

==Criticism==
Sociologist Gérald Bronner calls the notion of "deradicalization" flawed, saying "It means that you can take an idea or a belief out of the brain, and I think that’s just impossible" and instead suggests "not a kind of mental manipulation but the opposite — mind liberation, a strengthening of their intellectual immune systems".&lt;ref name=wash1&gt;{{cite web|title=France to open first of 12 ‘deradicalization’ centers for at-risk youths|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/france-to-open-first-of-12-deradicalization-centers-for-at-risk-youths/2016/09/14/d596d7fe-7a78-11e6-8064-c1ddc8a724bb_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Genetics Foundation (EGF)''' is a non-profit organization, dedicated to the training of young [[geneticist]]s active in medicine, to continuing education in genetics/genomics and to the promotion of public understanding of genetics. Its main office is located in [[Bologna, Italy]].

==Background==
In 1988 Prof. Giovanni Romeo, President of the European Genetics Foundation (EGF) and professor of Medical Genetics at the [[University of Bologna]] and Prof. [[Victor A. McKusick]] founded together the European School of Genetic Medicine (ESGM).

Since that time ESGM has taught genetics to postgraduate students (young [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]) from some 70 different countries.  Most of the courses are presented at ESGM's Main Training Center (MTC) in Bertinoro di Romagna (Italy), and are also available via [[webcast]] at authorized Remote Training Centers (RTC) in various countries in Europe and the Mediterranean area (Hybrid Courses). In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]], medical geneticists must attend at least one ESGM course before admission to their Board examinations.

For these reasons, the School has been able to expand and to obtain funding from the [[European Commission]] and from other international organizations.

==Presentation of the Ronzano Project==
The European School of Genetic Medicine was founded in 1988 and saw rapid success, which necessitated that an administrative body be formed.  To this end the '''European Genetics Foundation''' was born in [[Genoa]] on 20 November 1995, with the following aims:
*to run the ESGM,  promoting the advanced scientific and professional training of young European Geneticists, with particular attention to the applications in the field of preventive medicine;
*to promote public education about genetics discoveries;
*to organize conferences, courses, international prizes and initiatives aimed at bringing together the scientific and humanistic disciplines.

The ESGM began receiving funding from the European Union and from other international organizations including the [[European Society of Human Genetics]], the [[Federation of European Biochemical Societies]], the [[March of Dimes]] and [[UNESCO]].  Since its founding, the ESGM has become a model for other European institutions responsible for advanced training in genetics.

In order to fully realize all of the European Genetics Foundation’s aims, the Foundation has identified a permanent site for the ESGM at the [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|Hermitage]] of [[Ronzano]], a monastery situated in the hills of Bologna, at 3.5&amp;nbsp;km from the city center and 7&amp;nbsp;km from the airport.  The monastic order of the Servants of Maria, founded in Florence in 1233 and owner of the Hermitage, donated 16,000 m² for the purpose of constructing this center, which will be named the ''Giuseppe Levi and Victor A. Mckusick Euro-Mediterranean Center for Genetics and Medicine''.  [[Giuseppe Levi]], a world-famous scientist, trained three Nobel Laureates ([[Salvador Luria]], [[Renato Dulbecco]] and [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]]), and Victor A. McKusick is considered the father of [[medical genetics]] throughout the world.

The European Genetics Foundation envisions the Ronzano Center as a venue for advanced training, and as a think tank where experts in genetics and related disciplines from all over the world can discuss issues of scientific, social, and political relevance, and to develop problem-solving strategies to address these issues.

The new center will host:
*the European School of Genetic Medicine (ESGM)
*a European observatory for the legislation regarding genetic testing and policy regarding genetics research
*advanced scientific courses outside of the area of Genetics, geared toward scientist from developing countries
*a residential center in which Professors and students can live during residential courses
*the Federation of the Association for Rare Diseases of Emilia-Romagna.  (GIG, Genetic Interest Groups)
*various projects to diffuse information about genetics to the public.

The '''Evolutionary Principle''' is a largely psychological doctrine which roughly states that when a [[species]] is removed from the [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] in which it [[evolution|evolved]], or that habitat changes significantly within a brief period (evolutionarily speaking), the species will develop maladaptive or outright [[wiktionary:pathological|pathological]] behavior. The Evolutionary Principle is important in [[Neo-Tribalism|neo-tribalist]] and [[anarcho-primitivist]] thinking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3666">'''General fitness training''' works towards broad goals of overall health and well-being, rather than narrow goals of sport competition, larger muscles or concerns over appearance.  A regular moderate workout regimen and healthy diet can improve general appearance markers of good health such as muscle tone, healthy skin, hair and nails, while preventing age or lifestyle-related reductions in health and the series of heart and organ failures that accompany inactivity and poor diet.

Diet itself helps to increase calorie burning by boosting metabolism, a process further enhanced while gaining more lean muscle. An aerobic exercise program can burn fat and increase the metabolic rate.

==Weight loss and muscle definition==

General fitness training may be used to promote weight loss. Personal trainers construct a program centered on restructuring lifestyle while helping to provide the necessary motivation for its success.

General fitness training can also be used to promote toning or building of muscles, which are essentially the same physiological process.  (However, 'toning' implies moderate muscle definition, whereas 'building' implies increasing musculature significantly.)

==More specialized fitness training==

===Sports-specific training===

Sports-specific trainers can help improve [[physical strength|strength]], [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]] and [[Endurance|stamina]] to improve performance in specific [[sport]]s. Options include increasing arm strength for tennis playing or improve strength and core stability providing better balance playing [[golf]].

Sports specific training is all about developing physical conditions to improve performance and skills at a particular [[sport]]. Also, understanding the needs of the game, training/practicing at the correct pace, in order to meet sports requirements.

''''Injury recovery

Certified personal trainers can contribute significantly and uniquely to recovery and rehabilitation efforts. But personal trainers mainly pick up where physical therapy leaves off.

===Pre/post natal trainer===

During a [[pregnancy]] period a lot of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] is put on the [[muscle]] on the lower back due to the heavy weight being carried. [[Exercise]] and stretching can be extremely important to increase strength and reinforce the body structure for the extra weight.

During the [[second trimester]] (weeks 13-28) the unpleasant symptoms from the first trimester should have settled down and the mother will start to feel a renewed level of [[energy]]. The biggest change during this period will be the growth of the 'bump'. As the baby grows the mother should notice a change in her body position and [[neutral spine|posture]]. The extra weight occurs at the front of the body, the hip and back joints will take the strain. The posture will shift as the [[lower back]] [[muscle]]s tighten and take an exaggerated curvature. The [[abdominal muscles]] will stretch and strain to adapt to the growing baby. During this time it will be extremely beneficial to perform [[exercises]] to help strengthen weakened [[abdominal]] and [[pelvic floor muscles]], in order to reduce the [[Strain (injury)|strain]] on the [[lower back]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25017">'''Health in All Policies''' ('''HiAP''') was a term first used in [[Europe]] during the Finnish presidency of the [[European Union]] (EU), in 2006, with the aim of collaborating across sectors to achieve common goals. It is a strategy to include health considerations in policy making across different sectors that influence health, such as transportation, agriculture, land use, housing, public safety, and education.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Leppo, K., Ollila, E. Health in All Policies: Seizing Opportunities, implementing policies. Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, Finland: Helsinki 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Kickbusch I, Buckett K, editors. Implementing Health in All Policies: Adelaide 2010. Adelaide, South Australia: Department of Health, Government of South Australia; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It reaffirms public health's essential role in addressing policy and structural factors affecting health, as articulated by the Ten Essential Public Health Services,&lt;ref name="D"&gt;"Public Health in America." ''Health.gov | Your Portal to Health Information from the U.S. Government.'' Public Health Functions Steering Committee, July 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been promoted as an opportunity for the [[public health]] sector to engage a broader array of partners.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

==Overview==

The 1978 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) declaration of [[Alma-Ata]] was the first formal acknowledgment of the importance of intersectoral action for health.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;World Health Organization (WHO). Declaration of Alma-Ata. International Conference on Primary Health Care, Alma-Ata, USSR, 6–12 September 1978. WHO, Geneva, 1978. Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH/docs/declaration_almaata.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205022743/http://www.who.int/hpr/NPH/docs/declaration_almaata.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of Alma-Ata was carried forward in the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]] (adopted in Ottawa in 1986), which discussed "healthy public policies" as a key area for [[health promotion]].&lt;ref name="G"/&gt;

HiAP is built on the rationale that [[health]] is determined by multiple factors outside the direct control of the health care sector, such as education, income, and the conditions in which people live, work, and play.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="C"&gt;Healthy People 2020. Department of Health and Human Services, 7 June 2012. Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;http://www.healthypeople.gov&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions made in other sectors can positively or negatively affect the determinants of health.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; HiAP is an approach to policy making in which decision-makers in other sectors routinely consider health outcomes, including benefits, harms, and health related-costs.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

HiAP has also been described as an essential component of [[primary health care]].&lt;ref name="E"&gt;"The World Health Report 2008." WHO. World Health Organization, Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;http://www.who.int/whr/2008/whr08_en.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; HiAP has been most commonly implemented by federal, state and local governments, but it can also be applied to both private and non-profit policy-making.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F"&gt;"Health in All Policies." ''The National Association of County and City Health Officials'' | NACCHO. Web. Jan. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
HiAP builds off the concepts embedded in "healthy public policies" and "intersectoral action for health," promoted over the past four decades.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Peña, Sebastián. "Health in All Policies: The emperor’s old clothes | Healthy Policies." ''Healthy Policies | For A Healthier World''. Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;http://www.healthypolicies.com/2011/08/health-in-all-policies-the-emperor’s-old-clothes/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of Alma-Ata was carried forward in the [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion]] (adopted in [[Ottawa]] in 1986), which discussed "healthy public policies" as a key area for [[health promotion]].&lt;ref name="G"/&gt;  Increased attention to the role of non-health sectors in promoting health continued to grow with discussions held at the Second International Conference on Health Promotion in Adelaide, Australia in 1988.&lt;ref name="I"&gt;WHO and the Government of South Australia. (2010) The Adelaide Statement on Health in All Policies: moving towards a shared governance for health and well-being. ''Health Promotion International''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, HiAP was recommended by Adelaide Thinker in Residence Ilona Kickbusch as a new approach to health and governance in South Australia.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

==Definition==
In the context of the 8th WHO Global Conference on Health Promotion, it has been defined as "an approach to public policies across sectors that systematically takes into account the health and health systems implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts, in order to improve population health and health equity." Such an approach is founded on health-related rights and obligations. It emphasizes the consequences of public policies on health determinants and aims to improve the accountability of policy-makers for health impacts at all levels of policy-making.&lt;ref name="J"&gt;8th WHO Global Conference on Health Promotion. Official website. http://www.healthpromotion2013.org/health-promotion/health-in-all-policies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples worldwide==

HiAP has been widely implemented in many parts of the world.

===Finland===
One of the first countries to adopt a "healthy policies" approach to address public health concerns was [[Finland]]. The [[North Karelia]] Project, launched in 1972, aimed to reduce the impact of coronary heart disease in the Finnish region of [[North Karelia]] by engaging other sectors (like community organizations, dairy and meat producers, schools) to improve community health.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; The project, which involved the support of the Finnish authorities and the [[WHO]], resulted in significant reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality and has been noted as a successful model for cross-sector collaboration.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;Puska, P.,Vartiainen, E. et al. The North Karelia Project: from North Karelia to National Action. National Institute for Health and Welfare: Finland 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Finland has continued its work in HiAP.  For example, in 2001 Finland formulated the principles for the implementation of the Health 2015 cooperation program that provides a framework for intersectoral health promotion.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; The purpose of the long-term health policy strategy is to improve health, help promote the adoption of healthy lifestyles among the Finnish people and to reduce health disparities between different groups of the population.&lt;ref name="Health 2015 public health program"&gt;"Health 2015 public health program." ''Ministry of Social Affairs and Health- Finland''. Web. 5 Feb. 2013. &lt;http://www.stm.fi/en/health_2015&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The implementation of HiAP in [[South Australia]] has focused on "developing a process to position HiAP as a core process of government, rather than an approach run by and for the health sector".&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L"&gt;Buckett, Kevin. "Health in All Policies Adelaide 2010 International Meeting." ''Public Health Bulletin SA'' 7.2 (2010): 1-60. Web. Jan. 2013.&lt;http://www.health.sa.gov.au/pehs/publications/publichealthbulletin-pehs-sahealth-1007.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The South Australian model of HiAP is based on two basic elements: central governance and accountability and a "health lens" analysis process.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

The 2010 Adelaide Statement of Health in All Policies describes instances in which HiAP works best and provides tools that can be useful at different phases of policy implementation.&lt;ref name="I"/&gt; While South Australia has formally adopted the concept of shared governance for health, critics have noted that South Australia is still far from having an established "health in all policies" governance system.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

===Canada===
ActNow BC is an ongoing example of HiAP implementation in Canada. The intersectoral-based HiAP strategy aims to improve British Columbians' health by addressing common risk factors and reducing [[chronic disease]]s. Involving local governments, communities, employers, and schools, ActNow BC seeks to develop and promote programs that make British Columbians opt for healthy choices.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;"Health in All Policies - CIHR." ''Canadian Institutes of Health Research''. Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;http://www.cihrirsc.gc.ca/e/43794.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
With the goal of implementing a global strategy to fight [[cancer]], France launched the Cancer Plan in 2003. One of its main objectives was to reduce cancer mortality by 20% in 5 years, by establishing goals that involved the participation of multiple sectors.&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; Evaluation of the plan in 2008 revealed that although progress was made in some areas, several of the goals were not met. Among the weaknesses of the plan, was the lack of consideration of [[social inequalities]] and access to health care and an ineffective coordination of patient care.&lt;ref name="N"&gt;Haut Conseil de la Sante Publique, Evaluation du Plan Cancer, Rapport Final, 2009 in http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/rapport_cancer_230209.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; To address the deficiencies of the 2003 plan and continue with its implementation, the French Government launched the Cancer Plan 2009-2013 in November 2009.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;Institut National du Cancer, Cancer Plan 2009-2013, 2009 in www.e-cancer.fr/component/.../4787-plan-cancer-version-anglaise&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
Fueled by the health reform in 2000, [[Thailand]] has encouraged the practice of intersectoral collaboration by making the use of [[Health Impact Assessment]]s (HIAs) mandatory at all levels of government.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;Kang, E; Park, H; Kim, J. Health Impact Assessment as a Strategy for Intersectoral Collaboration, Journal of Preventive &amp; Public Health, 2011: 44(5): 201-209.&lt;/ref&gt; HIAs have been conducted to help combat the increasing number of health problems caused by air pollution, pesticide contamination, coal-fired power plants, and other environmental hazards. HIAs are seen as a valuable tool to promote collaboration between stakeholders to consider diverse interests and identify approaches to design a healthier society.&lt;ref name="Q"&gt;Phoolcharoen, W;  Sukkumnoed, D &amp; Kessomboon, P; Development of health impact assessment in Thailand: recent experiences and challenges; Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2003, 81 (6).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
====Federal====
Since 2009, the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] have worked together through the Partnership for Sustainable Communities. The three agencies jointly prioritized six livability principles that have been used to guide funding decisions, proposed policies, and legislative recommendations within the agencies. The principles target improvements in affordable housing, green building, transit, mixed-use development, water management, and brownfield space.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; Each of the principles promotes the mission of one or more of the individual agencies, such as efficient transportation, economic development, clean environment, etc. Many of the individual principles are also understood to contribute to health outcomes. Through a growing portfolio of case studies from at least 45 communities across the US, the partnership has demonstrated that individual elements of building healthier communities can contribute to other policy goals, such as greater economic development and better living conditions.

The concept of HiAP is included in section 4001 of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (2010), which mandated creation of the National Prevention Council, led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], and the development of the National Prevention Strategy.&lt;ref name="X"&gt;National Prevention Council, National Prevention Strategy, Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Prevention Strategy, published in June 2011, calls for increased coordination between government agencies, as well as partnerships with community organizations, businesses, healthcare providers, and others.&lt;ref name="X"/&gt; The National Prevention Strategy prioritizes work around four strategic directions: creating healthy community environments, empowering individuals to make healthy choices, integrating clinical and community preventive services, and reducing health disparities. That can be accomplished, for example, through creating more neighborhoods with better access to fruits and vegetables, active transportation, and clean air.&lt;ref name="X"/&gt;

====State====
[[California]]'s Health in All Policies Task Force, created in 2010 by Executive Order S-04-10, represents the first formal statewide effort to bring together policy makers to identify and recommend programs, policies, and strategies to improve health using a HiAP framework. The task force, staffed by the [[California Department of Public Health]], comprises 19 state agencies, offices, and departments, is under the auspices of the Strategic Growth Council, was created in 2008.&lt;ref name="R"/&gt; The 2010 report, "Health in All Policies Task Force Report to the Strategic Growth Council," identifies 34 recommendations ranging from single actions to ongoing, multi-agency initiatives.  All recommendations are linked to six principles: transport, housing, affordable healthy food, safe neighborhoods, green space, and that decision makers consider health consequences during policy development.&lt;ref name="Z"&gt;Health in All Policies Task Force Report to the Strategic Growth Council Executive Summary, Sacramento (CA): Health in All Policies Task Force, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of recommendations include developing health criteria into discretionary funds review process and incorporating health issues into state data collection and survey efforts.&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt;

====Local====
The [[San Francisco Department of Public Health]] (SFDPH) has worked extensively to implement HiAP. For example, its Healthy Development Measurement Tool is a comprehensive set of evaluation and planning tools that bring health considerations into urban planning and development.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Dannenberg, A. L., R. Bhatia, B. L. Cole, S. K. Heaton, J. D. Feldman, and C. D. Rutt. "Use of Health Impact Assessment in the U.S." American Journal of Preventive Medicine 3.34 (2008): 241-256. Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/publications/AJPM_HIAcasestudies_March2008.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The tools provide metrics to consider health in urban plans and stress the importance of gathering input from community members. SFDPH has also worked with community partners to conduct a variety of [[Health Impact Assessment|HIA]]s, including assessing the impact of changes to the living wage ordinance, housing policies, and zoning policies.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;

Use of HIA has increased among local entities across the United States.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; For example, an HIA was conducted in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] to assess all the possible health effects of a proposed development of a football stadium. A community coalition including Los Angeles Community Action Network, Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, and Comunidad Presente, worked with community members and Human Impact Partners, to gather information on the expected health effects of the proposed development and address concerns about loss of affordable housing, displacement of low-income individuals, and increases in noise and pollution. They developed a report describing current trends in health conditions, demographics, housing, employment, and safety, the expected impact of the proposed stadium, and a list of recommendations for mitigating harm.&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt; As a part of a larger legal case, presentation of the concerns resulted in receipt of $15 million to a housing trust fund to create and maintain low income housing, $1.9 million for air quality improvements, $300,000 for housing experts to address tenants' rights.&lt;ref name="Z"/&gt;

==Support==
A HiAP approach has gained support from health advocates in the United States. The [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) acknowledges that policies made outside of the health sector shape the environments people live in and the choices they make.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R"&gt;Institute of Medicine. Living well with chronic illness: A call for public health action. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It notes that some public health problems are so complex that they are best tackled not only by traditional health policy but also by policies and issues that affect the [[social determinants of health]] such as schools, zoning, food advertising, public transportation, parks, workplaces, restaurants, and tax policy.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; The IOM recommends implementing a HiAP approach for more fully addressing the determinants of health, better coordinate efforts across sectors and more effectively using public resources.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;

Many public health associations have also endorsed HiAP. The [[American Public Health Association]] calls HiAP a "gold standard" and calls for increased HiAP infrastructure at all levels of government, increased funding for HiAP related research, practice and training, as well as establishment of best practices and a formal national research agenda.&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; The [[National Association of County and City Health Officials]] (NACCHO), the first national association to adopt a position statement on HiAP, advocates for HiAP as a critical method to promote health and encourages local health departments to disseminate HiAP best practices to policy makers.&lt;ref name="F"/&gt; The National Network of Public Health Institutes praise HiAP and see themselves and their member partners as potential facilitators of HiAP implementation.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;"Health in All Policies." ''National Network of Public Health Institutes''. Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;22. http://nnphi.org/program-areas/health-in-all-policies&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
The primary critiques of HiAP have raised concerns that HiAP breeds "health imperialism." They claim that by putting health concerns at the top of agendas, HiAP may appear to prioritize health as an outcome most worthy of policy makers' attention, diluting attention to other outcomes under the agencies’ authority.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T"&gt;Kemm, J. (2001). Health Impact Assessment: A Tool for Healthy Public Policy. Health Promotion International, 16(1): 79-85. doi: 10.1093/heapro/16.1.79 accessed from http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/1/79.full&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of HiAP have contended that health is not the only domain of societal well-being that can benefit from interdisciplinary policy making. They suggest that rather than viewing HiAP as an attempt to increase the influence of health professionals, HiAP might be used as a template for future movements such as "economics in all policies" and "education in all policies".&lt;ref name="T"/&gt;

The IOM acknowledges many fundamental challenges to HiAP. While there are many examples where cooperation is mutually beneficial, there are also examples where the aims of one interest directly conflicts with another. For example, since the 1950s, efforts by public health professionals to limit tobacco sales have been in opposition to efforts of the tobacco industry to maintain personal freedoms for citizens and a free market environment for cigarette manufactures.&lt;ref name="V"&gt;"Adelaide Recommendations on Healthy Public Policy." ''World Health Organization''. Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/previous/adelaide/en/index.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Even non-controversial outcomes, such as increased income and education, can also raise contentions through ideological differences for accomplishing these  goals.&lt;ref name="V"/&gt;

Some groups have also questioned the rigor with which the health impacts of non-health policies have been or can be assessed. Critics note the difficulties inherent in collecting data that provides a description of current (baseline) conditions and predicting estimates of a policy's potential impact on health.&lt;ref name="W"&gt;Rose, Barbara A., Joseph Schuchter, and Sarah A. Wylie. "Promoting Health Impact Assessment to Achieve Health in All Policies." ''American Public Health Association''. 15 Feb. 2012. Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;http://www.apha.org/NR/rdonlyres/C4FD8ED0-4AC7-4FCF-8E80-64B466E7ACB4/0/D3.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, training and supporting individuals to conduct such assessments is a challenge.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

==Health impact assessment==

While implementation of HiAP can be done through many mechanisms, such as policy development, program management and service delivery,&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;Collins J, Koplan JP. Health Impact Assessment: A Step toward Health in All Policies. J Am Med Assoc. 2009;302(3):315-317.&lt;/ref&gt; the most widely promoted and cited mechanism to implementing HiAP is HIA.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;"Health Impact Assessment (HIA)." APHA: ''American Public Health Association''. Web. Jan. 2013. &lt;http://www.apha.org/NR/rdonlyres/171AF5CD-070B-4F7C-A0CD-0CA3A3FB93DC/0/HIABenefitHlth.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  HIA is defined as "a systematic process that uses an array of data sources and analytic methods and considers input from stakeholders to determine the potential effects of a proposed policy, plan, program, or project on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population".&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;Institute of Medicine. Improving Health in the United States: The Role of Health Impact Assessment. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many have called attention to the need to make a clearer distinction between HIA and HiAP, citing HIA as one component of HiAP, a broader strategy that seeks to achieve better health outcomes, improve quality of life, and reduce health disparities.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;Braverman PA, Egerter SA, Mockenhaupt RE. Broadening the focus: the need to address the social determinants of health. Am J Prev Med. 2011;40(1S1): S4-S18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of policies==

In June 2013, Finland's Ministry of Social Affairs and the [[WHO]] hosted the 8th Global Conference on Health Promotion in Helsinki.  Among its main objectives, the conference addressed the challenges facing the implementation of HiAP, encouraged the exchange of past experiences, which could lead to the design of effective pathways for intersectoral collaboration, and analyzed the impact and advancement of health promotion since the first conference on health promotion in 1987. As a contribution to the conference, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has published a book with a global scope to help policy-makers worldwide to implement HiAP.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; In 2017, to improve accounatbility for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Detereminants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social detereminants of health that improve health equity, noting that the World Health Organization is developing the first global monitoring system for intersectoral interventions that are known to improve health equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784–787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Health of Towns Association''' was formed at a meeting in [[Exeter]] on 11 December 1844 and was a key organisation in the development of [[public health]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Ashton-Ubido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]], which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities, quickly prompting the creation of Health of Towns Association branches in several major cities, including [[Edinburgh]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name=Ashton-Ubido /&gt; These national and local movements led to the passing of the [[Public Health Act 1848]].

==Early life==

Hobart Edward Freeman was born in [[Ewing, Kentucky]], and grew up at [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], where he became a successful businessman after studying at [[Byrant and Stratton College|Bryant and Stratton Business Institute]], despite being a high school dropout.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year" By Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN 197?, back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; He also contracted polio,&lt;ref&gt;John F. MacArthur in ''Charismatic Chaos'' says that (p237) "Hobart Freeman's theology did not let him acknowledge that polio had left one of his legs disfigured and lame. 'I have my healing' is all he would say when anyone pointed out the rather conspicuous inconsistency between his own physical disabilities and his teaching."&lt;/ref&gt; and in later years "... walked stiffly ... with an obvious limp." &lt;ref&gt;"Never Far From Home" by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman was converted to [[Christ]] in 1952 at the age of 31, and baptized into a congregation within the Southern Baptist Convention.

Shortly before Freeman received "the baptism in the Holy Spirit", he survived a heart attack. He "claimed" his healing,  disposed of his medications, and almost immediately suffered a series of angina attacks, which eventually subsided.&lt;ref&gt;"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year" By Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN nd, pages 49 &amp; 50.

Note: The word "claimed" in this context does NOT mean he claimed that he was healed, but rather that he claimed the promise of healing that he believed was in the atonement. As such, the word is used in a theological sense rather than in an everyday sense.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman felt called to the [[Minister (Christianity)|ministry]], and educated at the [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]] with a [[Bible]] and History major, and then at the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] (A.B., Th.M.) with an [[Old Testament]] major. In 1961, he earned a Doctorate of Theology from [[Grace College|Grace Theological Seminary]] in [[Winona Lake, Indiana]] with a thesis entitled "The Doctrine of Substitution in the Old Testament",&lt;ref&gt;Co-authors of this thesis included Richard Michalak, Charles Ware, George Brost, George A Brost and Kevin Magde.&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed a [[professor]] of Hebrew and Old Testament Studies, and [[Philosophy]] and [[Ethics]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Teaching and preaching==

According to John Davis, Freeman came to be deeply influenced by [[Kenneth E. Hagin]], [[John Osteen]], [[Kenneth Copeland]], [[T. L. Osborn|T.L. Osborn]] and [[E.W. Kenyon]], who were leaders of the [[Word of Faith]] Movement.&lt;ref name="Mystic"&gt;"Freeman: Mystic, Monk, or Minister?" by John Davis, ''Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union'' 27 September 1983, page 1a&lt;/ref&gt; However Freeman explicitly rejected their Doctrine of Identification, which asserted that Jesus died spiritually,&lt;ref&gt;"Did Jesus Die Spiritually? Exposing the JDS Heresy" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; and he also repeatedly warned his congregation about the leaders and their teachings.&lt;ref&gt;"Died Jesus Die Spiritually?" by Hobart Freeman, tape number 332, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman's opposition to that doctrine was confirmed by Daniel McConnell.&lt;ref&gt;"A Different Gospel: A Historical and Biblical Analysis of the Modern Faith Movement" by Daniel R. McConnell, Hendrickson Publishers Peabody MA 1988 page 131&lt;/ref&gt; However McConnell also described Freeman as a "renegade preacher of the Faith movement"&lt;ref&gt;"A Different Gospel: A Historical and Biblical Analysis of the Modern Faith Movement" by Daniel R. McConnell, Hendrickson Publishers Peabody MA 1988 page xix&lt;/ref&gt; who "eventually broke with the other Faith teachers".&lt;ref&gt;"A Different Gospel: A Historical and Biblical Analysis of the Modern Faith Movement" by Daniel R. McConnell, Hendrickson Publishers Peabody MA 1988 page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact details continue to be debated, it is not unreasonable to include Freeman within the orbit of the Word of Faith Movement, as he also taught that healing was "promised in the atonement",&lt;ref&gt;''Healing in the Atonement'' by Hobart Freeman, tape number 115, nd&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Faith for Healing'', where he also taught that "Confession brings possession, for what you confess is your faith speaking." &lt;ref&gt;"Faith for Healing" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Ministries and Publications, Warsaw IN nd page 10&lt;/ref&gt; These latter ideas aroused much opposition within the seminary, and Freeman was asked to leave in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;However Freeman said, while giving his testimony, that he was asked to leave the seminary due to his conservative view of scripture. See "Testimony of Hobart Freeman" by Hobart Freeman, tape number 111, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman established his own [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]], subsequently known as ''Faith Assembly'', with Melvin Greider &lt;ref&gt;Melvin Lee Greider (b.23 April 1936 d.16 April 1980) served in the US Navy and became a biker and alcoholic before he converted to Christ. He died of a heart attack, and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, which is located at the intersection of Epworth Forest and County Road 975 East in Tippicanoe Township. See [http://www.nweb.lib.in.us/indiana_room/twp_cemeteries/database/tAllTwpCemeteries_menu.asp ''Tippecanoe Township Cemeteries Online'']&lt;/ref&gt; in 1963 in his own home at Winona Lake in nearby [[Kosciusko County, Indiana|Kosciusko County]]. And for many years, worked 15–16 hours a day, seven days a week with seemingly indeflatable energy,&lt;ref&gt;"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year" By Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN 197?, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and at one point visited Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year" By Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN 197?, pages 51 and 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years, Freeman established a house church at [[Claypool, Indiana|Claypool]] in a "pink house next to the water tower", where the meetings followed a simple format:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After much singing and what sounded like people quoting the Bible, a tall lanky man, who looked remarkably like Billy Graham, walked stiffly to the front with an obvious limp. He was the pastor, Dr. Hobart Freeman, and he commanded everyone's attention. He had a Ph.D. in theology, and he was teaching the last in a series of messages on the book of Revelation. He spoke for an hour or more about the end of the world and the new heavens and the new earth. He spoke with the conviction that all these things were going to happen just like the Bible said. ...

That night ... [the] singing was even livelier than early that morning, and the message was about faith. This church believed that God would really answer their prayers if they just believed. The pastor told stories of people being healed of sickness and being protected in storms by commanding the winds to stop. He believed that his leg would be healed from the polio he had had years before. ... At the end of the service, we went to the front for prayers ....&lt;ref&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From there the church moved to a three-car garage, then on to an old sheep barn near [[North Webster, Indiana|North Webster]] where they had been holding a coffeehouse ministry on Friday nights. The barn was owned by a burly, whiskery biker, Melvin Greider &lt;ref name="Mystic"/&gt; nicknamed Mack, a former alcoholic who had become a Christian, and was named the "Glory Barn" by Freeman. This ministry attracted hundreds of people, including some misfits but most were normal, serious-minded young adults. The local people referred to the Glory Barn in derision and spread exaggerated rumours about what was done there.&lt;ref name="Cindy Barnett 2005, p81"&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p81&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not the opinion of those who sat under this ministry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we sat under Dr. Freeman's ministry, we saw his genius as a teacher. His theology was as solid as a Baptist minister, but he had the fire of a Pentecostal maverick like [[Smith Wigglesworth]] or [[William Branham]]. And he had the guts of the early martyrs. His manner was bookish, but he was such a skilled teacher that he kept our attention long enough to teach us biblical theology in terms we could understand. We eventually heard him teach on every passage in the Bible, and he backed up his positions, putting them in the context of church history and current events. All the reasoning was so logical it appealed to our minds as well as our hearts.&lt;ref name="Cindy Barnett 2005, p81"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eventually both the upper and lower levels of the Glory Barn were filled to overflowing. The floorboards bent and shook dangerously as the congregation danced "charismatic jigs" to the praise songs. They would travel long distances and stand in long lines early each Sunday morning to ensure a good seat. The many young assistant pastors had reserved seats up front.&lt;ref&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p84&lt;/ref&gt; These young pastors travelled and spoke at meetings over a wide area. There was a worldwide following through his tapes and books.&lt;ref name="Cindy Barnett 2005, p86"&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p86&lt;/ref&gt; There were some 15,000 in daughter congregations elsewhere in Indiana, [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], [[Missouri]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Florida]], as well as in [[England]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]].

Freeman also began teaching college-level classes on Saturday mornings covering Old and New Testament theology, Christian ethics, church history and even Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p83&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 after conflict with the owner, Freeman took the congregation to a large circus tent just north of [[Warsaw, Indiana|Warsaw]] and then on to another near [[Goshen, Indiana|Goshen]] throughout that summer and autumn. There was little protection from the wind and rain or the heat and cold. The nursery was a row of vans for the mothers and babies. Portable toilets were the only facilities. By winter a meeting hall had been built near [[North Webster, Indiana|North Webster]] in a cornfield belonging to one of the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Don Nei has been suggested as the donor of the land for the new building, but no source was cited.&lt;/ref&gt; There were large bathrooms, a nursery for the mothers and babies, and a meeting room large enough to hold 2,000 people which was often overflowing. It wasn't fancy for the floors were cement, and the walls were bare.&lt;ref&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p85, 105&lt;/ref&gt;At the end of the summer of 1980 there was an epidemic of whooping cough that seemed to go through all the families of the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p109&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many charismatic congregations, the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] was emphasized - with claims of [[prophesy]], miraculous healings, [[Testimony|testimonies]], [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]] and believers being [[slain in the Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;''Never Far From Home'' by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p85, 105&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman's teaching emphasized the deeper life in the Spirit, overcoming all things, separation from the world and its ways, trusting only in God for all things, the crucified life, and the true meaning of discipleship, as seen in the topics covered by his teaching tapes and literature.

The authority of Freeman's teaching was regularly reinforced by his "prophecies", published with meeting notices. &lt;ref&gt;[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Hobart_Freeman_-_Prophecy_to_the_Congregation_-_15_January_1984.jpg Hobart Freeman - Prophecy to the Congregation - 15 January 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman's teaching also generated a social dimension. A sense of community care, cohesion, exclusiveness, superiority and persecution grew with the breadth, authority and enthusiasm of his teaching. Those with divergent doctrines, beliefs or practices either conformed or were excluded. Outside interactions grew less and were sometimes severed over these issues. Evangelical outreach shrivelled. So while legalism was denounced from the pulpit, it was practiced amongst the congregation to the extent that it has been described  as "cultist tendencies".&lt;ref&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p78, 81, 85, 86, 87&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings were comprehensive and logical, including the roles of women, music, jobs, medical science, government, the military, education, birth control, sports and holidays. Christmas was condemned as a pagan festival. A woman's role in the home as a wife and mother was seen to be the most noble and worthiest of callings. Children were regarded as a blessing from God and birth control was actively discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Never Far From Home by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005, p74, 83, 86, 101, 110, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to a certain degree of uniformity within the congregation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People outside Faith Assembly joked that we all looked alike. A typical Faith Assembly family on their way to church consisted of a man, who was probably a construction worker, carrying a notebook and Bible under one arm and a diaper bag over his shoulder. He would be walking with his wife, who would be wearing a denim skirt and carrying a baby, with several other kids in tow. They would drive a van.&lt;ref name="Cindy Barnett 2005, p86"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Christianity Today'' rapported that "According to Freeman's faith-formula theology, God is obligated to heal every sickness if a believer's faith is genuine. Faith must be accompanied by positive confession, meaning that believers must claim the healing by acknowledging that it has taken place."&lt;ref&gt;''Christianity Today'', November 23, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  This understanding was more or less accepted by the pastorate, with the wife of one recalling that "Dr. Freeman taught that it was always God's will to heal in response to our faith, and that God would do it without the aid of doctors or medicine." &lt;ref&gt;"Never Far From Home" by Cindy Barnett, Selah Publishing Group, Surprise, Arizona, 2005 page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, doctors and medicine came to be disparaged and reviled.&lt;ref&gt;John F. MacArthur in ''Charismatic Chaos'' says that (p237) "Freeman and the Faith Assembly congregation utterly disdained medical treatment, believing that modern medicine was an extension of ancient witchcraft and black magic. To submit to a doctor's remedies, Freeman believed, was to expose oneself to demonic influence." In a more mild but troubled manner, Cindy Barnett in ''Never Far from Home'' says that (p153) "I had struggled for years with what Dr. Freeman had taught about divine healing. It wasn't that I doubted God would heal, but I questioned the way medical science was put down and discouraged. I was always trying to build up my faith, looking at it from every angle, reading books, and asking God about it. I would stare out the window wondering where all this would lead."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobart Freeman did write that "... we must practice thought control. We must deliberately empty our minds of everything negative concerning the person, problem, or situation confronting us ..." &lt;ref&gt;"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN nd page 20. The first part of this quotation was deleted in the subsequent edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  And he continued writing that "Sickness often can only be overcome by maintaining a positive confession of God's promises in the face of all apparent evidence to the contrary." &lt;ref&gt;"Biblical Thinking and Confession: The Key to Victorious Living 365 Days a Year" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Publications, Warsaw IN nd page 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively Hobart Freeman had come to advocate faith in "faith", not faith in God.

==Controversy==

From the beginning, Freeman's congregation was the subject of controversy.

At a meeting of the County Board of Health on October 23, 1974, Barbara Clouse, the Health Nurse for Kosciusko County was concerned that the Glory Barn was a major health problem and it would only get worse. She detailed her concerns, saying that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Diabetics]] were not taking their [[insulin]] and pregnant women were receiving no pre-natal or post-natal care. ... They are laying dead babies and live babies next to each other on the altars and praying over them to get the live babies to bring life back to the dead ones. There was one woman in our county praying over a baby for four days before the funeral home got hold of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yesteryear.clunette.com/150yearspart3.html Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 24 October 1974]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clouse's concerns were later supported by local hospital statistics for 1975/6, which suggested that women from the congregation who gave birth at home were over 60 times more likely to die than those who gave birth at hospital under medical supervision. Later assessment by the US Department of Health and Human Services supported this conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/00000345.htm  ''Epidemiologic Notes and Reports Perinatal and Maternal Mortality in a Religious Group -- Indiana''] by Anon, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (1 June 1984), 33(21):297-298. See also ''The Faith Assembly: A Study of Perinatal and Maternal Mortality'' by C. Spence, T.S. Danielson and A.M. Kaunitz, Indiana Medicine 1984 (March): 180-183.&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths of several women, infants and babies were reported, and the local media blamed Freeman's teachings as medical treatment had been declined or refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yesteryear.clunette.com/150yearspart3.html Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 10 July 1976]&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaths continued to be reported to the frustration of county law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yesteryear.clunette.com/150yearspart4.html Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 10 March 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after they were publicized, the old Glory Barn burnt down in the early hours of July 4, 1980. Six people escaped from the burning two-story barn. Two youngsters, Joel and Lee, suffered burns before they were rescued from their bedrooms by their father Brendan Wahl. The boys' mother, Peggy Wahl (née Nusbaum), also claims to have been involved in their rescue, along with their daughter Penny who was not injured{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. Fire brigades from [[North Webster, Indiana|North Webster]], [[Syracuse, Indiana|Syracuse]] and [[Cromwell, Indiana|Cromwell]] fought the blaze for some two hours until dawn, and the fire was subsequently investigated by the Noble County Police and Indiana State Fire Marshal. North Webster fire officials described the fire as of "suspicious origin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://yesteryear.clunette.com/150yearspart4.html Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 7 July 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; To date no culprit has been charged.

In May 1983, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' ran a story on David Gilmore whose 15-month-old son, Dustin Graham, had died five years previously from an easily treatable form of meningitis. Following church teaching, Gilmore and his wife had relied solely on prayer for their son's healing. Gilmore said he knew of twelve other children who had died under similar circumstances. ''The Tribune'' further identified fifty-two deaths from Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky which, they asserted, were attributable to church teaching. A few months later, ABC television's ''[[Nightline]]'' reported that pregnant women following church teaching died at a rate eight times the national average and their children at three times. ''Nightline'' further identified nineteen states and five countries where deaths had occurred which, they asserted, were attributable to church teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/julyweb-only/7-7-43.0.html ''A Surgeon's View of Divine Healing''] by Paul Brand and Philip Yancey, ''Christianity Today'', 25 November 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Hobart Freeman was charged with aiding and abetting one of these deaths by what was described as "negligent homicide".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=-EqDysdaREAC&amp;dat=19841018&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en ''Faith Assembly leader is sought for aiding, inducing homicide"], Madison Courier, 18 October 1984, p.3d-f."&lt;/ref&gt; At least ninety members of the congregation died during Freeman's ministry,&lt;ref&gt;Jim Quinn and Bill Zlatos "Assembly's Message Ominious" ''Fort Wayne (Indiana) News-Sentinel'', 2 June 1984, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; which Daniel McConnell described as tragic and preventable.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel R. McConnell in ''A Different Gospel - A Historical and Biblical Analysis of the Modern Faith Movement'' says that (p81) "For sheer volume of death and tragedy, none can match the record of Hobart Freeman, pastor of Faith Assembly, Wilmot, Indiana. Estimates of the number of preventable deaths associated with Faith Assembly itself are as high as 90. The number of deaths nationwide caused by Freeman's teaching on healing is not known." McConnell continues to say that (p96) "Besides Faith Assembly, Freeman ministered throughout the South in a network of sister churches based on his teaching. Although not to the same extent, these churches also experienced deaths due to non-treatment of sickness. The author is personally familiar with a tragic death as far south as Alabama in a church which practiced Freeman's teaching."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Two weeks before this matter was to come to court, Freeman died at his Shoe Lake home of [[pneumonia|bronchial pneumonia]] and [[congestive heart failure]] complicated by an [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerated]] [[gangrene|gangrenous]] leg, which in the weeks preceding had forced him to preach sitting down. He had refused all medical help,&lt;ref&gt;"Faith Preacher Hobart Freeman Dies" by Steven Lawson, ''Charisma'' February 1985, page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; even to the removal of the bandages so his leg could be cleaned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Interview with Mrs June Freeman, Winnona Lake (Indiana) 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously in ''Faith for Healing'', Freeman had said that "To claim healing for the body and then to continue to take medicine is not following our faith with corresponding action ... When genuine faith is present, it alone will be sufficient for it will take the place of medicines and other aids." &lt;ref&gt;"Faith for Healing" by Hobart E. Freeman, Faith Ministries and Publications, Warsaw IN nd page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman's death was not reported for at least 13 hours due to an all-night prayer vigil for his resurrection. He was buried in a pine box with no public viewing and no graveside or memorial service.&lt;ref&gt;"Faith Assembly Mourns Death of Leader" by Kathy Muckle, ''Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union'' 10 December 1984, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; For some time afterwards, his wife, June Freeman (d. 29 January 2000), left his suit over the end of the bed, expecting him to one day walk in and have need of it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; She soon came to accept his death as the will of God, and encouraged the congregation to persist in their faith. &lt;ref&gt;[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/June_Freeman_-_Letter_to_the_Congregation_-_1_January_1985.jpg June Freeman - Letter to the Congregation - 1 January 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

In June 1985, Jack Farrell, one of the two assistant pastors hand-picked by Hobart Freeman, quit the congregation, telling "The Body" during the Sunday sermon, that they were still "in bondage" to their late pastor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yesteryear.clunette.com/150yearspart4.html Warsaw (Indiana) Times Union, 10 September 1985]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the congregation also grew disillusioned and left.&lt;ref name="Discussion Group"&gt;[http://www.tomax7.com/thoughts/feedback.htm Discussion Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others remained under the ministry of one or more of Freeman's successors.&lt;ref name="Discussion Group"/&gt; These successors include Joe and Jim Brenneman,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Brenneman ministers at Faith Assembly in Warsaw, Indiana and through [http://www.faithmandp.com/ Faith Ministries and Publications].&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Hill,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Hill married Pamela Freeman, the eldest daughter of Hobart Freeman on 6 June 1971 in Kosciusko County, Indiana, and now ministers under the name of [http://www.sjhillonline.com/ S.J. Hill] from Charlotte, North Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Ervin, Bruce Kinsey (d. 14 June 2008), Jim Mansfield, Gary Wilson, Terry Knafel, Jim Trout, Ron Moerchen, Don Mishler, Joe Duncan, Stan Hill, Tom Hamilton, Jim Oswalt, Dave Hardy, Harry Albright, Bill Garner, Jerry Reeder, Mark Yotter, Rick McCleay, Jeff Barnett &lt;ref&gt;Jeff and his wife Cindy Barnett minister at the [http://seymourgenesis.com/ Genesis Church] in Seymour, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt; and Tim Neely.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Neely ministers at the Bread of Life Assembly in Goshen, Indiana.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all are today generally acknowledged to be faithful to Freeman's ministry. Continuing congregations include groups at Larwill, Goshen and Indianapolis Indiana, Grand Centre/Cold Lake Alberta and Shelbyville Kentucky.&lt;ref name="Discussion Group"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Personal observations&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Joshua Wilson, son of former Faith Assembly members, and Jack Pennington, a freelance filmmaker from Winston-Salem NC, announced their plans to film a documentary they called ''Children of Faith Assembly'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenoffaithassembly.com ''Children of Faith Assembly'']&lt;/ref&gt; which was promoted on the blog ''Friendly Atheist''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/11/15/a-survivor-of-the-faith-assembly-cult-talks-about-growing-up-under-the-gaze-of-crazed-preacher-hobart-freeman/ ''Friendly Atheist - A Survivor of the Faith Assembly Cult Talks About Growing Up Under the Gaze of Crazed Preacher Hobart Freeman'']&lt;/ref&gt; However it was never produced.

'''Isaac Henrique Sequeira''' (1738-1816) was a Portuguese Sephardic Jewish doctor.&lt;ref name="El Pais"/&gt;

==Early life==
Sequeira was born in [[Lisbon]],&lt;ref name="Prado"/&gt; and educated at [[Bordeaux]] and [[Leiden]].&lt;ref name="Heynick2002"/&gt; 

==Career==
Sequeira served as physician extraordinary to the Portuguese Embassy at the [[Court of St James's]] in London, and honorary physician extraordinary to the Portuguese prince regent.&lt;ref name="Heynick2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Heynick|title=Jews and Medicine: An Epic Saga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAiD-P1CjeYC&amp;pg=PA449|accessdate=5 February 2018|year=2002|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|isbn=978-0-88125-773-1|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] (LCP) and practised medicine in [[Mark Lane, London|Mark Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Royal kalendar, or Complete and correct annual register &amp;#91;afterw.&amp;#93; The Royal kalendar and Court and city register. &amp;#91;2 eds.&amp;#93;.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-kNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=5 February 2018|year=1782|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequeira was painted in about 1775 by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], one of his patients, and that oil painting now hangs in Madrid's [[Museo del Prado]].&lt;ref name="El Pais"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2011/04/24/cultura/1303596003_850215.html|title=Reportaje - El salvador de los 'zurbarán'|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=24 April 2011|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2018|via=elpais.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prado"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/isaac-henrique-sequeira/8a1936f6-a7d8-4c00-b9a5-6bb1a99df911|title=Isaac Henrique Sequeira - The Collection - Museo Nacional del Prado|author=|date=|website=www.museodelprado.es|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Sequeira married Esther d'Aguilar (1739-1791), the daughter of [[Baron Diego Pereira d'Aguilar]]. In ''Jews and Medicine: An Epic Saga'', Frank Heynick describes him as "wealthy and pompous".&lt;ref name="Heynick2002"/&gt;

On 21 April 1814, his daughter Lydia died.&lt;ref name="Gentleman's Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|url=https://reftag.appspot.com/?book_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.co.uk%2Fbooks%3Fid%3DLfoRAAAAYAAJ%26pg%3DPA518%26lpg%3DPA518%26dq%3D%2522Isaac%2BHenriques%2BSequeira%2522%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3D8PBmnTm1yz%26sig%3DJaZOitvhm6v64L4xn0RLm5EI2uc%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0ahUKEwiBmZ-apY_ZAhUBJMAKHWzHBo0Q6AEIPDAH%23v%3Donepage%26q%3D%2522Isaac%2520Henriques%2520Sequeira%2522%26f%3Dfalse|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=The Gentleman's Magazine|date=1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Statue of John Henry outside the town of Talcott in [[Summers County, West Virginia]]]]

== Origins ==
The term was conceived in the 1970s by [[African American|African-American]] [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] and [[public health]] researcher [[Sherman James]] while he was investigating [[health disparities#Ethnic and racial disparities|racial health disparities]] between blacks and others in [[North Carolina]].

One of the people he interviewed was a [[black people|black]] man, who, despite being born into an impoverished [[Sharecropper#United States|sharecropper]] family and having only a [[second grade]] education, could read and write. The man had freed himself and his offspring from the sharecropper system, had {{convert|75|acre|ha}} of farmed land by age 40, but by his 50s, he had [[hypertension]], [[arthritis]], and severe [[peptic ulcer]] disease.&lt;ref name="Vivaldi" /&gt;

His name, John Henry Martin, and his circumstances were evocative of [[folk hero]] [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]], an [[African American]] who worked vigorously enough to compete successfully with a [[steam engine|steam powered]] machine but died as a result of his effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tracy, Steven C. |author2=Bradford, Roark |title=John Henry: Roark Bradford's Novel and Play |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2011 |pages= |isbn=0-19-976650-9 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hbFnHc_wcgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Bradford&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/johnhenry/ "John Henry, Present at the Creation"], Stephen Wade, ''[[NPR]]'', September 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

James' hypothesis was that African Americans sometimes attempted to control their environment through similar attempts at superhuman performance.  The expression of this superhuman performance may not necessarily involve a steel hammer.  It may involve working harder at the office or working long to prove one’s worth.  The end results, however, may still involve the same negative consequences that befell John Henry.  

James developed a scale for measuring JH based on agreement with a series of statements such as these:

* "When things don't go the way I want them to, that just makes me work even harder"
* "I've always felt that I could make of my life pretty much what I wanted to make of it."

In his seminal 1983 study, 132 southern, working class Black men between the ages of 17 and 60 years were administered the John Henryism scale.  The scale was used to measure the extent to which these men believed that they could control their environment through hard work and determination.  In accordance with the author's hypothesis, subjects who scored low on educational variables and high on John Henryism had significantly higher levels of diastolic blood pressure than those who scored above the median on both measures. James believed that educational achievement and the John Henryism construct score may have a positive correlation with autonomic arousal in African Americans when these individuals have encounters with everyday stressors.

== Effects ==
Men who scored higher on the John Henry scale were not found to have statistically significant differences in mean systolic blood pressure or mean diastolic blood pressure when compared to their lower scoring counterparts, however a significant effect did emerge in variation in percentage of hypertension. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; African American males who were categorized as low or medium SES (socio economic status) and had high levels of John Henryism, had a significantly higher % of hypertension than their counterparts with low levels of John Henryism &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, however high SES individuals with high levels of John Henryism were found to have lower levels of hypertension than their low John Henryism, high SES counterparts. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Studies have found that African-Americans with high scores are less likely to be current or former [[smoking|smokers]] than African-Americans with low JH scores. African-American college students with high JH scores were less likely to have carried a weapon on campus for self-defence, more likely to have been arrested for driving under the influence, and more likely to have missed a class due to alcohol use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology|last = Jackson|first = Yolanda|publisher = SAGE Publications Inc.|year = 2006|isbn = 1412909481|location = |pages = 281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kozlovichi Mental Asylum''' was an institution for the mentally ill in [[Randilovshchina]],  [[Hrodna Voblast|Grodno Province]], [[Belarus]]. The wooden construction housing the building was built in 1905 and destroyed by fire on October 12, 2003. The fire killed thirty patients.

==Fire==

Although President [[Alexander Lukashenko]]'s spokeswoman, [[Natalya Petkevich]], said that a patient (among those who died in the fire), described as a [[pyromania]]c who had twice previously tried to set fire to the building, was responsible for the blaze, government investigators were also looking into staff carelessness as a possible cause.  Staff members, some of whom had been sleeping in a separate building on the campus, apparently tried to put the fire out and rescue patients themselves, waiting to call the fire department.

'''LifeSharers ''' was a nonprofit [[United States]]-based organization which functioned as an [[organ donation]] network. By agreeing to donate their organs to the network, they received priority in receiving organs from other members of the network.

It was founded by Dave Undis in 2002, who believed that the best way to encourage increased organ donation was to ensure those willing to donate receive priority in receiving organs. But it has been criticized by those who believe that decisions of priority should be based on purely medical criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hennessey |first=Jaime J. |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=2071084 |title=A Members-Only Club for Organ Donors - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-06-14 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tabarrok |first=Alex |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703481004574646233272990474?mod=WSJ_latestheadlines |title=Tackling the Organ Shortage - WSJ |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia''' ({{Lang-sr|'''Agencija za lekove i medicinska sredstva'''}}; {{Lang-sr-Cyrl|'''Агенција за лекове и медицинска средства'''}}; abbr. '''ALIMS''') is the [[Serbia]]n national authority responsible for regulation and surveillance of the development, manufacturing and sale of human and veterinary [[drug]]s and [[medical device]]s. Its task is also to ensure that both individual [[patient]]s and [[healthcare]] professionals have access to safe and effective medicinal products.

Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia was founded by the Serbian Law on Medicines and Medical Devices in 2004, thus replacing previously existing Medicines Bureau of Yugoslavia (established in 1948) and Institute for testing and control of medicines of Serbia (established in 1960).

The Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia is a government body under the aegis of the Serbian Ministry of Health. Its operations are largely financed through fees. Approximately 180 people work at the agency; most are [[pharmacist]]s and [[Physician|doctors]].

== Organisation ==
=== Healthcare institutions ===
==== Tan Tock Seng Hospital ====
{{main|Tan Tock Seng Hospital}}
Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) was established in 1844 and named after its founder, Mr Tan Tock Seng, a philanthropist.

==Background==

In 1968, Lucinda Naugle, an office manager from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] and sister of former Ft. Lauderdale mayor, [[Jim Naugle]], began smoking at the age of 20.&lt;ref name="IC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/smoker-in-florida-awarded-300m-damages-against-philip-morris-1825057.html|title=Smoker in Florida awarded $300m damages against Philip Morris|author=Rupert Cornwell|date=November 21, 2009|work=The Independent|accessdate= June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She quit when she was 45.&lt;ref name="IC1" /&gt; As a result of smoking, Naugle suffered from severe [[emphysema]].&lt;ref name="BB1" /&gt;

At trial, Naugle claimed [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] directly concealed the fact that [[cigarettes]] were harmful to health and addictive.&lt;ref name="MLN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlnlaw.com/jury-awards-300-million-to-former-smoker.html |title=Jury Awards $300 Million to Former Smoker|accessdate= June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Morris was also sued on the basis that the cigarettes manufactured and sold by the company were unreasonably dangerous.&lt;ref name="ML1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morelaw.com/verdicts/case.asp?s=FL&amp;d=42035|title=Cindy Naugle v. Philip Morris|accessdate= June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was an Engle-progeny case, resulting from the Engle v. Liggett class action suit in 2006, where the [[Florida Supreme Court]] upheld a jury’s finding that cigarettes were dangerous to health and addictive.&lt;ref name="FB"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.floridabar.org/DIVCOM/JN/JNJournal01.nsf/d59e2cf27607c0cf85256ad1005ba53f/a0b86fb25b4e9cca85257aa6004b58d1!OpenDocument |title=Engle v.

Naugle v. Phillip Morris was tried in Broward County Circuit Court, Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and a verdict was returned by the jury on November 20, 2009. The plaintiff was represented by Robert W. Kelley of Kelley/Uustal PLC.&lt;ref name="ML1" /&gt;

==Appeal==

In 2010, a final judgment by [[Circuit Court]] Judge Jeffrey Streitfeld reduced the punitive damages to $36.8 million in a post-verdict motion.&lt;ref name="SS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-12-12/news/fl-naugle-tobacco-verdict-20121212_1_lucinda-naugle-addictive-nature-and-health-million-verdict|title=Fort Lauderdale woman's big money verdict against tobacco company tossed out|author=Jon Burstein|date=December 12, 2012|work=Sun Sentinel|accessdate= June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Morris USA later appealed this award, stating that the punitive damages were still excessive. The appeal was considered at the 4th District Court of Appeal in [[West Palm Beach]], which upheld Philip Morris USA’s liability in the case, but decided that a new jury would consider the final amount to be awarded to the plaintiff.&lt;ref name="SS2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4dca.org/opinions/June%202012/06-22-12/4D10-1607%20op.pdf|title=Cindy Naugle v.

The '''New York City AIDS Memorial''' is a public memorial built "to honor New York City's 100,000+ men, women and children who have died from [[AIDS]], and to commemorate and celebrate the efforts of the caregivers and activists."&lt;ref name= "dedication"&gt;{{cite web|title=New York City AIDS Memorial Dedication|url=https://www.visualaids.org/events/detail/new-york-city-aids-memorial-dedication|website=Visual AIDS|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first major space that is dedicated to the epidemic in New York City.&lt;ref name="dedication" /&gt; The memorial was opened on [[World AIDS Day]] on December 1, 2016. The design was developed by the efforts of nearly 500 architects who came up with the idea of an 18-foot steel canopy as the gateway to the new St. Vincent’s Hospital Park in [[Greenwich Village]].&lt;ref name= "memorial" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nycaidsmemorial.org/envisioning-a-perpetual-look-for-a-memorial-aids-park/|title=The New York City AIDS Memorial|website=The New York City AIDS Memorial|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  | quote ="It is impossible to convey the horror of such an epidemic and the injustice and stigma experienced by those directly affected, but public memorials serve as important reminders of our history, our shared values and the actions and attitudes we put forth as a public body during moments of crisis.

The New York City AIDS Memorial is located on the triangular [[traffic island]] formed by [[12th Street (Manhattan)|12th Street]], [[Greenwich Avenue]] and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] in [[Greenwich Village]]. The memorial is a gateway to a new public park adjacent to the former [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincent's Hospital]], which housed the city's first and largest AIDS ward and which is often considered the symbolic epicenter of the disease, figuring prominently in ''[[The Normal Heart]]'', ''[[Angels in America]]'', and other important pieces of literature and art that tell the story of the plague years in New York.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nycaidsmemorial.org/about/|title=The New York City AIDS Memorial|website=The New York City AIDS Memorial|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorial consists of an {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} high steel canopy covering about {{convert|1600|sqft|m2}}. The structure is composed by triangles ranging from scalene to equilateral. Three triangles serve as legs to connect two large triangles at the top, so that it looks like an open airplane.

In November 2011, in collaboration with magazine [[Architectural Record]] and industry database [[Architizer]], the NYC AIDS board announced an international design competition to manufacture memorial park. Brooklyn-based [[Studio a+i]], led by Mateo Paiva, Lily Lim and Esteban Erlich, won the contest and became memorial park architects.The memorial also features the work of visual artist [[Jenny Holzer]] whose idea was to engrave a granite panel with lines from [[Walt Whitman]]'s "[[Song of Myself]]".&lt;ref name="memorial" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/30/envisioning-a-perpetual-look-for-a-park-to-recognize-aids/?scp=3&amp;sq=aids&amp;st=cse/&amp;_r=0|title=Envisioning a Perpetual Look for a Memorial AIDS Park|last=Finn|first=Robin|date=January 30, 2012|work=|newspaper=New York Times-City Room|access-date=2017-01-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orthopaedic Research Society''' ('''ORS''') is a professional, scientific and medical organization focused on [[orthopaedic]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/36-3180285|title=ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH SOCIETY - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oref.org/grants-and-awards/research-education-programs|title=Research Education Programs|website=www.oref.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014215956/http://www.oref.org/grants-and-awards/research-education-programs#|archive-date=2017-10-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated mission of the ORS is to advance orthopaedic research through education, collaboration, communication and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pwrnewmedia.com/2017/aaos/advocacy_now/feb7/index.html|title=Advocacy Now|website=www.pwrnewmedia.com|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usbji.org/friends/memberships/participating-orgs?page=1|title=Participating Organizations|date=2014-06-10|work=United States Bone and Joint Initiative|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ORS aims to increase resources for research, and awareness of the importance and impact of such research on orthopaedic patients and the public.

The ''Journal of Orthopaedic Research'' is the official journal of ORS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Journal of Orthopaedic Research|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1554-527X|language=en|doi=10.1002/(issn)1554-527x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
Collaboration has been at the cornerstone of the Orthopaedic Research Society since it was founded in 1954.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Thomas D.|date=2002-8|title=TOWARD BETTER INTERACTION BETWEEN ORTHOPAEDISTS AND RESEARCHERS: A TWO-WAY STREET☆|url=https://journals.lww.com/jbjsjournal/Citation/2002/08000/TOWARD_BETTER_INTERACTION_BETWEEN_ORTHOPAEDISTS.25.aspx|journal=JBJS|language=en-US|volume=84|issue=8|pages=1473|issn=0021-9355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Victor M.|date=1989-07|title=Presidential address for the orthopaedic research society, 1988. ?Back to the future??responsibilities of the society|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jor.1100070421|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=612–615|doi=10.1002/jor.1100070421|issn=0736-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Dr. Alfred R. Shands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ors.org/alfred-r-shands-jr-md-award/|title=https://www.ors.org/alfred-r-shands-jr-md-award/|website=www.ors.org|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would later become one of the founding members of the ORS served as the chair of the Research Committee of the [[American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The committee conducted a survey of its member which indicated that just over 180 members were conducting some type of research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1950s, several musculoskeletal investigators expressed a desire to have a forum for presenting their work and receiving constructive criticism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Philip D. Wilson Jr.|Dr. Phillip D. Wilson]], a member of the Academy, along with several others, met in San Francisco and proposed the idea of starting an organization focused solely on musculoskeletal research.   This idea gained unanimous support from the [[American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons]] at their Annual Meeting in 1951.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1952, the first meeting of the founding members of the ORS took place. At this first meeting, [[Philip D. Wilson Jr.|Dr. Philip D. Wilson]] created a draft constitution and set of by-laws for the fledgling society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=R. R.|last2=Shands|first2=A. R.|date=1975-1|title=The orthopaedic research society. Its first twenty years|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=106|pages=285–289|issn=0009-921X|pmid=1092506}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was determined that the purpose of the society was to “encourage and coordinate investigation and research in basic principles or clinical problems related to the special field of Orthopaedic Surgery.” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   Due to the unexpected death of [[Dallas B. Phemister|Dallas B. Phemister, MD]], who had agreed to take on the role of chairman, the formal organization of the society was delayed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

1954 marked the first official meeting of the group at the Palmer House in Chicago under the Chairmanship of Dr.  Wilson.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  At this first meeting there were twenty-nine people in attendance.  Cultivating the relationship between clinicians and scientists while providing them with opportunities to come together and share ideas was the driving factor in establishing the society. “The close relationship of between clinicians and basic scientists would help ensure the prominent role of orthopaedic surgeons in delivering care to patients with injuries and diseases of the musculoskeletal system,” explained Eugene R. Mindell, MD who served as president of the ORS from 1972 – 1973.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The ORS continues to grow and evolve.  Membership has grown to more than 4,100 members from across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ors.org/about-ors/|title=https://www.ors.org/about-ors/|website=www.ors.org|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once a role only held by surgeons, in 1982 the ORS elected [[Van C. Mow]] as the first PhD president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Van C. Mow|date=2018-03-28|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Van_C._Mow&amp;oldid=832944563|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, Presidents are elected from each of the three disciplines represented in the membership: clinicians, biologists, and engineers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ors.org/past-presidents-of-the-ors/|title=https://www.ors.org/past-presidents-of-the-ors/|website=www.ors.org|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Policosanol'''  is the generic term for a mixture of long chain [[alcohol]]s extracted from plant [[wax]]es. It is used as a [[dietary supplement]].

Policosanol was originally derived from [[sugar cane]] but the chemicals can also be isolated from beeswax, cereal grains, grasses, leaves, fruits, nuts, and seeds of many foods.&lt;ref name=2010Rev/&gt;   Plant waxes consist of very long chain [[fatty acids]] that have been [[esterification|esterified]] to very long chain alcohols. Policosanols are very long chain alcohols with carbon backbones ranging from 24 to 34 carbons.&lt;ref name=2010Rev/&gt; 

The first policosanol supplements were produced by Dalmer Laboratories in Cuba; studies conducted and published by that group have found that policosanol is safe and effective as a [[lipid-lowering agent]]. However these studies were small, and efforts by groups outside of Cuba have failed to replicate these results.&lt;ref name=2010Rev&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marinangeli CP, Jones PJ, Kassis AN, Eskin MN | title = Policosanols as nutraceuticals: fact or fiction | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 259–67 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20301014 | doi = 10.1080/10408391003626249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regional odontodysplasia''' or '''odontogenesis imperfecta''' is an uncommon [[developmental abnormality]] of [[teeth]], usually localized to a certain area of the mouth.  The condition is nonhereditary. There is no predilection for race, but females are more likely to get regional odontodysplasia.  The [[tooth enamel|enamel]], [[dentin]], and [[pulp (tooth)|pulp]] of teeth are affected, to the extent that the affected teeth do not develop properly.  These teeth are very brittle.  On [[radiograph]]s the teeth appear more radiolucent than normal, so they are often described as "ghost teeth".&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Michael A. ''Basic Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology''. Volume 1. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Most cases are considered [[wikt:idiopathic|idiopathic]], but some cases are associated with syndromes, growth abnormalities, neural disorders, and vascular malformations.
Permanent teeth usually show effects of regional odontodysplasia if the deciduous tooth was affected. Many of these teeth do not erupt, and those that do have an increased risk of [[caries]] and periapical inflammation.

==Treatment and prognosis== 
Treatment and prognosis are usually based upon keeping these teeth and preserving the [[alveolus]]. For erupted teeth, [[endodontics]] is an option if the tooth is devitalized and restorable. For unerupted teeth, function can be restored with a removable [[partial denture]] until all major growth has been completed and a final restoration can be placed.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, Brad et al. ''Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology'', Third Edition, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Serbsky State Scientific Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry''' ({{lang-ru|Госуда́рственный нау́чный центр социа́льной и суде́бной психиатри́и им. В. П. Се́рбского}}) is a [[psychiatric hospital]] and [[Russia]]'s main center of [[forensic psychiatry]]. In the past, the institution was called the Serbsky Institute ({{lang-ru|Всесою́зный нау́чно-иссле́довательский институ́т о́бщей и суде́бной психиатри́и и́мени В. П. Се́рбского}}). The institution garnered negative publicity because many [[Soviet dissidents]] were examined there and then sent to [[psychiatric hospital]]s.

[[File:Serbskij-institute.jpg|thumb|A part of the institute building in Moscow]]

The Institute started in 1921, and was named after Russian [[psychiatrist]] [[Vladimir Serbsky]]. One of the main stated purposes of the institute was to assist in forensic psychiatry for the [[criminal court]]s. Moscow Serbsky Institute conducts more than 2,500 court-ordered evaluations per year.&lt;ref name=serbskyru&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serbsky.ru/ |script-title=ru:Государственный научный центр социальной и судебной психиатрии им.

The Institute also claimed leadership in studying different types of [[psychosis]], [[brain trauma]], [[alcoholism]] and [[drug addiction]]. One celebrity treated for an addiction was [[Vladimir Vysotsky]].&lt;ref name=newsru&gt;[http://www.newsru.com/russia/28nov2001/serbskogo.html Article about the Institute] in [[Newsru]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbsky Center is now headed by Zurab Kekelidze ([[:ru:Кекелидзе, Зураб Ильич|ru]]), the chief psychiatrist of the [[Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation]],&lt;ref name="Safina"&gt;{{cite news|author=Safina, Nailya [Наиля Сафина] |script-title=ru:Нет здоровья без душевного здоровья |trans-title=There is no health without mental health |url=http://mgzt.ru/article/2679/ |accessdate=21 March 2012 |newspaper=Meditsinskaya Gazeta |language=Russian |date=23 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205080221/http://mgzt.ru/article/2679/ |archivedate=December 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose dissertation was on [[sluggish schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kekelidze, Zurab [Зураб Кекелидзе]|script-title=ru:Кому выгоден миф о карательной психиатрии?

In the [[Soviet Union]], [[Soviet dissidents|dissidents]] were often declared mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Коротенко"&gt;{{cite book|author=Korotenko, Ada; Alikina, Natalia [Ада Коротенко, Наталия Аликина] |lastauthoramp=yes |script-title=ru:Советская психиатрия: Заблуждения и умысел|trans-title=Soviet psychiatry: fallacies and wilfulness|year=2002|publisher=Издательство «Сфера» [Publishing house "Sphere"]|location=Kiev|isbn=966-7841-36-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFEeAQAAIAAJ|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} In almost all cases, dissidents were officially examined at the Serbsky Central Research Institute,&lt;ref name="Коротенко"/&gt;{{rp|78}} which evaluated individuals accused under political articles.&lt;ref name="Коротенко"/&gt;{{rp|30}} Typically declared mentally ill, indictees were sent for [[involuntary treatment]] to special hospitals in the [[MVD]] system.&lt;ref name="Коротенко"/&gt;{{rp|30}} In the 1960s and 1970s, the procedure became public and evidence of “psychiatric terror” began to appear.&lt;ref name="Коротенко"/&gt;{{rp|41}} The majority of incarcerations date from the late 1960s to the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Коротенко"/&gt;{{rp|30}}

Gen.

In the 1960s Soviet psychiatry, particularly Serbsky Institute Director Dr. [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]], introduced the concept of "[[sluggish schizophrenia]]", a special form of the illness that supposedly affects only social behavior, with no effect on other traits: "most frequently, ideas about a ''struggle for truth and justice'' are formed by personalities with a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] structure", according to the Serbsky Institute professors.&lt;ref name="Applebaum"&gt;{{cite book|author=Applebaum, Anne|title=Gulag: a history|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0-7679-0056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|script-title=ru:Цитатник номера|journal=Вестник Ассоциации психиатров Украины [The Herald of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association]|issue=5|url=http://www.mif-ua.com/archive/article/37546|trans-title=Quote set of the issue|publisher=The Ukrainian Psychiatric Association|language=Russian|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most prisoners, in Viktor Nekipelov’s words, characterized the Serbsky Institute professor Daniil Lunts as "no better than the criminal doctors who performed inhuman experiments on the prisoners in Nazi concentration camps."&lt;ref name="Applebaum"/&gt;{{rp|549}}

== Post-Soviet era ==

The Center underwent many changes after the Soviet Union collapsed. Psychiatry is not used as a weapon against dissenters, according to Center Director [[Tatyana Dmitrieva]]. The rooms where Soviet dissidents were imprisoned were changed to treat alcohol and drug addicts.&lt;ref name=newsru/&gt;

Many psychiatric trials were pursued in order to protect high-ranking officials involved in rapes and murders, such as [[Yuri Budanov]] (he was convicted only after more than three years of trials).

However, [[Yuri Savenko]], the head of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]], alleged that "practically nothing has changed. They have no shame at the institute about their role with the Communists. They are the same people, and they do not want to apologize for all their actions in the past." Attorney Karen Nersisyan agrees: "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It’s an organ of power." Savenko claimed that the institution was not professionally run and thus violated the doctor's main commandment. Spurious diagnoses declared symptom-free individuals to be mentally ill (for example, Budanov or General [[Pyotr Grigorenko]]), and the reverse (for example, major D. Evsyukov, actor F. Yalovega and diplomat [[Platon Obukhov]]).&lt;ref name="К 120-летию"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Savenko, Yuri [Юрий Савенко]|script-title=ru:К 120-летию Осипа Мандельштама и 90-летию ГНЦ социальной и судебной психиатрии им.

== Instrument of oppression in post-Soviet Russia ==
{{main|Political abuse of psychiatry in Russia}}

In the 1990s and the 21st century the Serbsky Institute, now calling itself the Serbsky Center, was again employed as an instrument of oppression. Under Yeltsin (1993-1999), it collaborated with the Russian Orthodox Church against "non-traditional" religions, other Christian denominations and breakaway Orthodox churches or liberal Orthodox congregations. Under Putin (2000 to present), it has made controversial diagnoses for individuals engaged in political dissent and protest.

===Religious dissenters===
From 1994 onwards, the use of psychiatry was expanded to control religious dissenters and others and a special group for “study of the negative influence of religious groups” was created at the Serbsky Center, led by Professor Fyodor Kondratyev.&lt;ref name="Отчетный доклад"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Savenko, Yuri [Юрий Савенко]|script-title=ru:Отчетный доклад о деятельности НПА России за 2000–2003 гг|trans-title=Report on the activities of the IPA of Russia in 2000 to 2003|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]] [The Independent Psychiatric Journal]|year=2004|issue=2|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2004/2/summary.htm|accessdate=20 July 2011|issn=1028-8554|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kondratyev’s group started supervising trials all over the country.&lt;ref name="Права человека"/&gt; This led to legal actions that, for all intents and purposes, put people on trial for sorcery.&lt;ref name="Права человека"/&gt; The ''Independent Psychiatric Journal'' ([[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]) documented such trials, demonstrating that the charges of “gross harm to mental health” were not substantiated.&lt;ref name="Отчетный доклад"/&gt; The Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia repeatedly recorded  Kondratyev's activities and statements as the author of the pseudo-scientific theory of "sectomania", and documented the false charges for which he was responsible.&lt;ref name="Отчетный доклад"/&gt;

Kondratyev's special department at the Serbsky Center “for studying destructive cults” closely collaborated with the anti-cult activist [[Alexander Dvorkin]], who enjoyed some approval within the Russian Orthodox Church. Dvorkin ranks as “totalitarian sects" both the followers of the painter and Theosophist [[Nikolai Rerikh]] (1874-1947) and the religious communities of liberal Orthodox priests [[Yakov Krotov]] and Georgy Kochetkov.&lt;ref&gt;https://psmb.ru/en/tags/people/father-georgy-kochetkov.html &lt;/ref&gt; In Yury Savenko's words, “when a psychiatrist-academician (Dmitrieva, Sidorov) or an expert-psychologist of the Institute of Psychology of the Russian Academy of Sciences relies on the works of Dvorkin and [[Steven Hassan|Hassan]], which are not scientific in nature, it is a symptom of degradation.”&lt;ref name="Отчетный доклад"/&gt; 

In 2014, experts of the Serbsky Center received medical documents from a psychoneurological out-patients' clinic about the mental health condition of Alexander Dvorkin. After studying them, they concluded that he was in need of constant supervision by a psychiatrist and should take psychotropic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kotova, Ekaterina [Екатерина Котова]|script-title=ru:Минздрав поставил диагноз главному сектоведу|trans-title=The Ministry of Health gave a diagnosis to the main scholar of sects|url=http://www.trud.ru/article/05-08-2014/1316339_minzdrav_postavil_diagnoz_glavnomu_sektovedu.html|work=[[Trud (newspaper)|Trud]]|issue=107|date=5 August 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial of Soviet-era abuses===
Kondratyev not only denied accusations that he himself was ever engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry: he stated publicly that the very concept of Soviet-era "punitive psychiatry" was nothing more than&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fedor, Julie|title=Russia and the Cult of State Security: The Chekist Tradition, From Lenin to Putin|year=2011|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1136671862|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5ipAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177}}
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the fantasy [vymysel] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was [previously] used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The denial by the Serbsky Center of the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes in the 1960–1980s and the open rehabilitation of its leader, director academician Georgi Morozov, are evidence of the restoration of psychiatry as a tool of oppression.&lt;ref name="Отчетный доклад"/&gt;

In 2004, proponents of mental health reform failed to prevent the effort by the doctors of the Serbsky Institute to roll back reforms in the landmark [[Russian Mental Health Law]].&lt;ref name="Crazy"&gt;{{cite news|author=Murphy, Kim|title=Speak Out?

===Controversial diagnoses===
In 2012, Ukrainian psychiatrist [[Semyon Gluzman]] said that the Serbsky Institute still remained a leading service for Russian forensic psychiatric examinations.&lt;ref name="Дело Косенко"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pavlova, Svetlana |author2=Polyakovskaya, Elena |script-title=ru:Дело Косенко: лечение и возмещение|trans-title=The case of Kosenko: treatment and compensation|url=http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/24783898.html|publisher=[[Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=12 December 2012|date=28 November 2012|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbsky Institute continues to conduct many court-ordered evaluations with hotly disputed results.

* In numerous cases people "inconvenient" for Russian authorities were imprisoned in psychiatric institutions in the first decade of the 2000s.&lt;ref name="Crazy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dissent1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Finn, Peter|title=In Russia, Psychiatry Is Again a Tool Against Dissent|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/29/AR2006092901592_pf.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dissent2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychiatry used as a tool against dissent|publisher=[[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons]]|url=http://www.aapsonline.org/nod/newsofday339.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003071839/http://www.aapsonline.org/nod/newsofday339.php|archivedate=3 October 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were diagnosed at the Serbsky Institute.
* When war criminal Yuri Budanov was tested at the Institute in 2002, the panel conducting the inquiry was led by Tamara Pechernikova, who had condemned poet [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]]. Budanov was found not guilty by reason of "temporary insanity". After public outrage, he was found sane by another panel that included Georgi Morozov, the former Serbsky director who had declared many dissidents insane in the past.&lt;ref name="Glasser"/&gt;
* The Center also made an evaluation of the alleged mass poisoning of hundreds of Chechen school children.&lt;ref name="illness"&gt;{{cite news|author=Litvinovich, Marina [Марина Литвинович]|script-title=ru:Загадочная болезнь|trans-title=Mysterious disease|url=http://2006.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2006/92n/n92n-s10.shtml|work=[[Novaya Gazeta]]|date=4 December 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel concluded that the disease was caused simply by "psycho-emotional tension".&lt;ref name="Chechen1"&gt;{{cite web|title=What made Chechen schoolchildren ill?|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/nc/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=31533|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|date=30 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chechen2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Murphy, Kim|title=War-related stress suspected in sick Chechen girls|url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/War-related-stress-suspected-in-sick-Chechen-girls-2539185.php|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=19 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The case of Mikhail Kosenko===
On 8 October 2013, a verdict was announced in the case of [[Mikhail Kosenko]], who took part in the 6 May 2012 protest march at Moscow's [[Bolotnaya Square]]. The court sent Kosenko for open-ended treatment to a psychiatric hospital.&lt;ref name="Davidoff"&gt;{{cite news|author=Davidoff, Victor|title=Soviet Psychiatry Returns|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/soviet-psychiatry-returns/487761.html|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With other witnesses, [[Alexander Podrabinek]], former Soviet dissident and [[Radio France Internationale]] commentator, testified that Kosenko had stood next to him and had not scuffled with police. Serbsky specialists concluded that Kosenko "presented a danger to himself and others" and "required compulsory treatment." This conclusion ignored both his previous treatment over many years and his diagnosis by other psychiatrists, and the fact that he was not once cited for aggressive or suicidal behavior during the 16 months of his [[pretrial detention]] in [[Butyrka prison]].

The Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia stated: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"On the basis of a conversation that lasted less than one hour, the specialists made the far more serious diagnosis of [[paranoid schizophrenia]] instead of the diagnosis of sluggish neurosis-like schizophrenia that Kosenko was treated for over the course of 12 years."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were protests from international and local NGOs and human rights organisations against the unlimited term of in-patient treatment imposed on Mikhail Kosenko. On 6 June 2014 a court in the Moscow Region ruled that he should continue psychiatric treatment, but as an out-patient.

== Role in post-Soviet forensic examinations ==

According to Russian psychiatrist Emmanuil Gushansky, the Serbsky Center exercises undue administrative and corporate influence on its young and insufficiently qualified staff. The commission system of forensic psychiatric examinations leads to "collective irresponsibility" in which no individual is accountable for a particular diagnosis or other recommendation. For example, the Serbsky Center declared a killer to be insane and offered a diagnosis of "acute stress". In fact, the killer had maintained communication with his victim, remembered the conflict with his victim. During a drunken household brawl he managed to find a shotgun in his basement, shoot his victim, clean and hide the weapon, removing his fingerprints, and then flee the scene. In accord with the Center's recommendation, he was declared insane and released from confinement.&lt;ref name=Gushansky2009&gt;{{cite web|author=Gushansky, Emmanuil [Эммануил Гушанский]|script-title=ru:Психиатр как судебный эксперт – между молотом и наковальней|trans-title=The psychiatrist as a forensic expert—between hammer and anvil|url=http://www.polit.ru/article/2009/11/19/psy/|publisher=Polit.ru|date=19 November 2009|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Yuri Savenko stated that the law on state expert activity and the introduction of the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center had monopolized forensic examination, which it had never done in the Soviet era. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but the new law allowed the court only to choose an institution. The head of the institution assigns the experts to a commission for each case. Experts are certified only after working in a state institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center was also the head of the Center's forensic psychiatry department, which is the only one in the country.&lt;ref name="Отчетный доклад"/&gt;

According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center has long labored to institutionalize its monopolistic position as the country's main psychiatric institution. These efforts led to a considerable drop in the quality of expert reports. The Serbsky Center further attempted to eliminate the adversarial character of court proceedings and to degrade the role of specialist reviewers.&lt;ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Savenko, Yuri; Bartenev, Dmitry [Юрий Савенко, Дмитрий Бартенев] |lastauthoramp=yes |script-title=ru:Психиатр и юрист о новой инициативе центра им.

On 28 May 2009, Savenko wrote to the then [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] an [[open letter]], in which Savenko asked Medvedev to submit to the [[State Duma]] a draft law prepared by the IPA to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The letter said that expert reports now often dropped entire sections and failed to substantiate findings, that findings contradicted the descriptive sections, and that many statements are contrary to generally accepted scientific practice. The letter added that courts made no attempt to assess the expert report for coherence and consistency and do not check findings for accuracy, completeness and objectivity. In the spring of 2009, IPA attacked an expert report whose descriptive part was distorted, paving the way for other falsifications; four of the case's six examinations were carried out in the Serbsky Center.&lt;ref name="Открытое письмо"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Savenko, Yuri [Юрий Савенко]|script-title=ru:Открытое письмо Президенту Российской Федерации Д.А. Медведеву|trans-title=The open letter to the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]] [The Independent Psychiatric Journal]|year=2009|issue=2|issn=1028-8554|pages=5–6|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2009/2/medved.htm|accessdate=12 July 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 2009, the working group chaired by [[Tatyana Dmitrieva]] sent the [[Supreme Court of Russia]] a joint proposal to outlaw appeals against state forensic expert reports and prohibit lawsuits that appealed against the reports. The proposal  claimed that the appeals were filed “without regard for the scope of the case” and that appeals should be made “only together with the sentence.” Savenko claimed that all professional errors and omissions became unchallengeable because they were the basis of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/&gt;

The application was considered in the paper “Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation” by E.Y. Shchukina and S.N. Shishkov.&lt;ref name="Щукина, Шишков"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shchukina, Elena; Shishkov, Sergei [Елена Щукина, Сергей Шишков] |lastauthoramp=yes |script-title=ru:Актуальные правовые вопросы судебно-психиатрической экспертизы|trans-title=Relevant legal issues of forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation|journal=[[Russian Journal of Psychiatry|Российский психиатрический журнал]]|year=2009|issue=6|pages=24–28|url=http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=13037938|publisher=Издательская группа "[[GEOTAR-Media|ГЭОТАР-Медиа]]" ["GEOTAR-Media publishing group"]|issn=1560-957X|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attacked the admissibility of appeals against expert reports without regard for the scope of the case. According to lawyer Dmitry Bartenev, while talking about “the reports”, the paper mistakenly conflates the reports with actions of the experts (or the institution) and asserts the impossibility of “parallel” examinations. However, abuse of rights and legitimate interests of citizens, including trial participants, may be a subject for a separate appeal.&lt;ref name="Савенко, Бартенев"/&gt;

In 2010, when the outpatient forensic-psychiatric examination of Yulia Privedyonnaya was carried out in the Sebsky Center, its experts asked her the question “What do you think of [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]]?”. Savenko called the question inappropriate, unseemly and indelicate.&lt;ref name="Как Вы относитесь к Путину?"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Savenko, Yuri [Юрий Савенко]|script-title=ru:Как Вы относитесь к Путину?|trans-title=What do you think of Putin?|journal=[[Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal]]|year=2010|issue=№ 1|pages=93–94|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2010/1/20_putin.htm|accessdate=31 July 2011|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1983 novel ''[[Firefox Down]]'' by [[Craig Thomas (author)|Craig Thomas]], captured American pilot Mitchell Gant is imprisoned in a [[KGB]] psychiatric clinic "associated with the Serbsky Institute", where he is drugged and forced him to reveal the location of the [[Mikoyan MiG-31 (fictional)|Firefox]] aircraft, which he has stolen and flown out of Russia.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Craig|authorlink=Craig Thomas (author)|title=Firefox Down|year=1983|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553-17095-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1998 TV series ''[[Seven Days (TV series)|Seven Days]]'', episode 16 "There's something about Olga", the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] recruits a female patient of the Serbsky Center (incorrectly located in the city of [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]]).

The '''shooting of Taufik Zahar''' took place around 4.36&amp;nbsp;am on 31 May 2015, near the [[Shangri-La Hotel Singapore|Shangri-La Hotel]] in [[Singapore]] where the [[Shangri-La Dialogue]] was being held; police officers fatally shot Mohamed Taufik bin Zahar, a 34-year-old logistics mover.&lt;ref name="planning-new-life"&gt;{{cite news |last= Cheong|first=Danson |date=4 June 2015 |title=Shangri-La Shooting: Wife of man shot by police says they were planning new life together |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shangri-la-shooting-wife-of-man-shot-by-police-says-they-were-planning-new-life-together |newspaper=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taufik, who was driving a red [[Subaru Impreza]] and was carrying two passengers, had encountered a [[roadblock]] set up in relation to the dialogue. When instructed to open the Subaru's [[Trunk (car)|boot]] for checks, Taufik accelerated the vehicle towards police officers, crashing through concrete barriers erected by the police, and continued driving the vehicle despite repeated warnings to stop. Anticipating threats to their safety, police officers [[handgun|opened fire]] at the vehicle and shot Taufik dead through the windscreen.&lt;ref name="spf-statement"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1 June 2015 |title= Consolidated Update to Incident along Orange Grove Road  |url=http://www.police.gov.sg/mic/2015/06/20150601_others_incident_orange_grove_consolidate_update.html |location=Singapore |agency=Public Affairs Department, Singapore Police Force |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229175057/http://www.police.gov.sg/mic/2015/06/20150601_others_incident_orange_grove_consolidate_update.html |archivedate=29 December 2015 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FEMA - 19603 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 10-19-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|A [[waitress]] at a restaurant is expected to exhibit positivity, such as smiling and expressing positive emotion towards customers]]
{{nihongo|'''Smile mask syndrome'''|スマイル仮面症候群|sumairu kamen shōkōgun|lead=yes}}, abbreviated '''SMS''', is a [[psychological disorder]] proposed by professor [[Makoto Natsume]] of [[Osaka Shoin Women's University]], in which subjects develop depression and physical illness as a result of prolonged, unnatural smiling.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, Lisa. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/fashion/06WORK.html?pagewanted=all Putting Some Fun Back Into 9 to 5]", ''New York Times'', March 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Natsume proposed the disorder after counselling students from the university in his practice and noticing that a number of students had spent so much time faking their smiles that they were unaware that they were smiling even while relating stressful or upsetting experiences to him. Natsume attributes this to the great importance placed on smiling in the Japanese service industry, particularly for young women.&lt;ref name="Natsume"&gt;{{cite book|last=Natsume|first=Makoto|title=Smile Kamen Shōkōgun: Hontō no Warai no Torimodoshi-kata|year=2006|publisher=NHK}} Previewed at {{cite web|url=http://www.nhk-book.co.jp/seikatujin/2006.html#2006_1|title=Seikatsunin Shinsho|publisher=NHK|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smiling is an important skill for Japanese women working in the service industry. Almost all service industry companies in Japan require their female staff to smile for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=thetimes&gt;Leo Lewis, [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article2608285.ece Smiling can seriously damage your health], ''The Times'', February 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Natsume says that his female patients often talk about the importance of smiling when the topic of the conversation is on their workplace. He relates examples of patients saying that they felt their smile had a large effect on whether they were hired or not, and that their superiors had stressed the effect that good smiles had on customers.&lt;ref name="Natsume"/&gt; According to Natsume, this atmosphere sometimes causes women to smile unnaturally for so long that they start to suppress their real emotions and become depressed.&lt;ref name=thetimes/&gt;

Japanese author [[Tomomi Fujiwara]] notes that the demand for a common smile in the workplace emerged in Japan around the 1980s, and blames the cultural changes wrought by the [[Tokyo Disneyland]], opened in 1983, for popularizing the demand for an obligatory smile in the workplace.&lt;ref name=thetimes/&gt;

The smile mask syndrome has also been identified in Korea.&lt;ref name=han&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sun-you|title=The Depressing Truth Behind a Smile|url=http://www.hanyangian.com/cover2/search.php|journal=The Hanyang Journal|volume=316|date=December 2012|pages=8–9|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean writer Bae Woo-ri noted that smiling gives one a competitive advantage over the others, and has become a necessary attribute of many employees, just like a "neat uniform".&lt;ref name=han/&gt; Yoon-Do-rahm, a psychology counselor, compared the current society, which is full of smile-masks, to a clown show; both are characterized by plentiful, yet empty and fake, smiles.&lt;ref name=han/&gt;

Smile mask syndrome can cause physical problems as well as mental ones. Natsume relates that many of his patients developed muscle aches and headaches as a result of prolonged smiling, and says that these are similar to the symptoms of [[repetitive strain injury]].&lt;ref name=thetimes/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Sokushinbutsu'''|{{linktext|即|身|仏}}}} are a kind of [[Buddhist mummies|Buddhist mummy]]. The term refers to the practice of [[Buddhist]] monks observing [[asceticism]] to the point of death and entering [[mummification]] while alive.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah, Ken. Living Buddhas: The Self-mummified Monks of Yamagata, Japan. McFarland, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They are seen in a number of Buddhist countries, but the Japanese term "sokushinbutsu" is generally used.

It is believed that many hundreds of monks tried, but only 24 such mummifications have been discovered to date. There is a common suggestion that [[Shingon]] school founder [[Kukai]] brought this practice from [[Tang Dynasty#Religion and philosophy|Tang]] [[China]] as part of secret [[tantra|tantric]] practices he learned, and that were later lost in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agorajournal.org/2005/Lowe.pdf |title=Shingon Priests and Self-Mummification |year=2005 |author=Aaron Lowe |publisher=Agora Journal |accessdate=2012-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829061915/http://www.agorajournal.org/2005/Lowe.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Origin ==
[[File:Huineng.jpg|thumb|Sokushinbutsu (mummy) of [[Huineng]], in [[Shaoguan]], [[Guangdong]], China]]

There is the existence of at least one "self-mummified" 550-year-old corpse: that of a Buddhist monk named Sangha Tenzin in a northern Himalayan region of India,&lt;ref name=bbcnewssoku&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20150501-a-500-year-old-mummy-with-teeth A 500 year old Mummy with teeth], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; visible in a temple in Gue village, [[Lahaul and Spiti district|Spiti, Himachal Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=bbcnewssoku/&gt; This mummy was discovered in 1975 when the old [[stupa]] preserving it collapsed and it is estimated to be from about the 14th century, well after Islamic rule had arrived in India and Buddhism had practically vanished there. The monk was likely a Tibetan [[dzogpa-chenpo]] practitioner and similar mummies have been found in [[Tibet]] and East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Jeremiah (2010), Living Buddhas: The Self-mummified Monks of Yamagata, Japan, McFarland, pages 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; The preservation of the mummy for at least 5 centuries was possible due to the aridity of the area and cold weather.&lt;ref name=bbcnewssoku/&gt;

According to Paul Williams, the ''Sokushinbutsu'' ascetic practices of Shugendō were likely inspired by [[Kūkai]] – the founder of [[Shingon Buddhism]],&lt;ref name="Williams2005p362"/&gt; who ended his life by reducing and then stopping intake of food and water, while continuing to meditate and chant Buddhist mantras. Ascetic self-mummification practices are also recorded in China, but are associated with the ''Ch'an'' (Zen Buddhism) tradition there.&lt;ref name="Williams2005p362"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Buddhism: Buddhism in China, East Asia, and Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHj5DWDJjnIC&amp;pg=PA362 |year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-33234-7 |pages=362 with footnote 37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate ascetic practices similar to ''Sokushinbutsu'' are also known, such as public [[self-immolation]] (auto cremation) practice in China, such as that of [[Fayu Temple]] in 396 CE and many more in the centuries that followed.&lt;ref name="Benn2007p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

== Japan ==
A mountain-dwelling version of Buddhism called [[Shugendō]] emerged in Japan as a syncretism between Vajrayana, [[Shinto]] and [[Taoism]] in the 7th century, which stressed ascetic practices.&lt;ref name=jeremiah10&gt;Ken Jeremiah (2010), Living Buddhas: The Self-mummified Monks of Yamagata, Japan. McFarland, pages 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition continued through the [[Edo period]]. One of its ascetic practice was ''Sokushinbutsu'' (or ''Sokushin jobutsu''), connoting mountain austerities in order to attain [[Buddha-nature]] in one's body. This practice was perfected over a period of time, particularly in the [[Three Mountains of Dewa]] region of Japan, that is the [[Mount Haguro|Haguro]], [[Mount Gassan|Gassan]] and [[Mount Yudono|Yudono]] mountains.&lt;ref name=jeremiah10/&gt; These mountains remain sacred in the Shugendō tradition to this day, and ascetic austerities continue to be performed in the valleys and mountain range in this area.&lt;ref name=jeremiah10/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobetti2013p130"/&gt;

In medieval Japan, this tradition developed a process for ''Sokushinbutsu'', which a monk completed over about 3,000 days to ten years.&lt;ref name=jeremiah10/&gt; It involved a strict diet called ''mokujikigyo'' (literally, "eating a tree").&lt;ref name=jeremiah11/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lobetti2013p130"/&gt; The diet abstained from any cereals, and relied on pine needles, resins and seeds found in the mountains, which would eliminate all fat in the body.&lt;ref name=jeremiah11/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnewssoku/&gt; Increasing rates of fasting and meditation would lead to starvation. The monks would slowly reduce then stop liquid intake, thus dehydrating the body and shrinking all organs.&lt;ref name=jeremiah11/&gt; The monks would die in a state of ''jhana'' (meditation) while chanting the ''[[nenbutsu]]'' (a [[mantra]] about Buddha), and their body would become naturally preserved as a mummy with skin and teeth intact without decay and without the need of any artificial preservatives.&lt;ref name=jeremiah11&gt;Ken Jeremiah (2010), Living Buddhas: The Self-mummified Monks of Yamagata, Japan, McFarland, pages 11-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcnewssoku/&gt; Many Buddhist ''Sokushinbutsu'' mummies have been found in northern Japan and estimated to be centuries old, while texts suggest that hundreds of these cases are buried in the [[stupas]] and mountains of Japan.&lt;ref name="Lobetti2013p130"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tullio Federico Lobetti|title=Ascetic Practices in Japanese Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3W2_AAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-47273-4 |pages=130–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mummies have been revered and venerated by the laypeople of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Lobetti2013p130"/&gt;

One of the altars in the Honmyō-ji temple of [[Yamagata prefecture]] continues to preserve one of the oldest mummies - that of the ''sokushinbutsu'' ascetic named Honmyōkai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tullio Federico Lobetti|title=Ascetic Practices in Japanese Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3W2_AAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-47273-4 |pages=132–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of self-mummification was mainly practiced in [[Yamagata Prefecture|Yamagata]] in Northern [[Japan]] between the 11th and 19th century, by members of the Japanese [[Vajrayana]] school of Buddhism called [[Shingon]] ("True Word"). The practitioners of ''sokushinbutsu'' did not view this practice as an act of suicide, but rather as a form of further [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jref.com/japan/culture/religion/sokushinbutsu.shtml|title=Sokushinbutsu - Japanese Mummies|publisher=JapanReference.com |accessdate=2013-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tap water''' (''running water'', ''city water'', ''town water'', ''municipal water'', etc.) is [[water]] supplied to a [[tap (valve)]]. Its uses include drinking, washing, cooking, and the flushing of [[toilet]]s. Indoor tap water is distributed through "indoor [[plumbing]]", which has existed since antiquity but was available to very few people until the second half of the 19th century when it began to spread in popularity in what are now [[developed country|developed countries]]. Tap water became common in many regions during the 20th century, and is now lacking mainly among people in poverty, especially in [[developing country|developing countries]].

Tap water is often culturally assumed to be [[drinking water]], especially in developed countries. Usually it is potable, although [[water quality]] problems are not rare. Household [[water purification]] methods such as [[water filter]]s, [[boiling]], or [[distillation]] can be used when tap water's potability is doubted. The application of technologies (such as [[water treatment]] plants) involved in providing clean water to homes, businesses, and public buildings is a major subfield of [[sanitary engineering]]. Calling a water supply "tap water" distinguishes it from the other main types of fresh water which may be available; these include water from rainwater-collecting [[cistern]]s, water from [[village pump]]s or town pumps, water from [[Water well|well]]s, or water carried from streams, rivers, or lakes (whose potability may vary).

==Background==
Publicly available treated water has historically been associated with major increases in life expectancy and improved [[public health]].  [[Water-borne diseases]] are vastly reduced by proper sewage and fresh water availability. Providing tap water to large urban or suburban populations requires a complex and carefully designed system of collection, storage, [[water purification|treatment]] and distribution, and is commonly the responsibility of a government agency, often the same agency responsible for the removal and treatment of [[clean water]].

Specific [[compound (chemistry)|chemical compounds]] are often taken out of tap water during the treatment process to adjust the [[pH]] or remove contaminants, and [[chlorine]] may be added to kill [[biotoxin|biological toxins]]. Local geological conditions affecting [[groundwater]] are determining factors for the presence of various metal [[ion]]s, often rendering the water "[[soft water|soft]]" or "[[hard water|hard]]".

Tap water remains susceptible to biological or chemical contamination. In the event of contamination deemed dangerous to public health, government officials typically issue an advisory regarding water consumption. In the case of [[biological contamination]], residents are usually advised to boil their water before consumption or to use bottled water as an alternative. In the case of chemical contamination, residents may be advised to refrain from consuming tap water entirely until the matter is resolved.

In many areas a [[compound (chemistry)|compound]] of [[fluoride]] is added to tap water in an effort to improve [[dental health]] among the public. In some communities "[[Water fluoridation|fluoridation]]" remains a controversial issue. (See [[water fluoridation controversy]].)

==Potable water supply==
{{main|Potable water}}
This supply may come from several possible sources.
* [[Water purification|Municipal water supply]]
* [[Water well]]s
* Processed water from creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, rainwater, etc.

Domestic water systems have been evolving since people first located their homes near a running water supply, such as a stream or river.  The water flow also allowed sending waste water away from the residences.

Modern indoor plumbing delivers clean, safe, potable water to each service point in the distribution system.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  It is important that the clean water not be contaminated by the waste water (disposal) side of the process system.  Historically, this contamination of drinking water has been the largest killer of humans.&lt;ref&gt;''Plumbing: the Arteries of Civilization'', Modern Marvels video series, The History Channel, AAE-42223, A&amp;E Television, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Tap water can sometimes appear cloudy, often mistaken for mineral impurities in the water. It is usually caused by air bubbles coming out of solution due to change in temperature or pressure. Because cold water holds more air than warm water, small bubbles will appear in water. It has a high dissolved gas content that is heated or depressurized, which reduces how much dissolved gas the water can hold. The harmless cloudiness of the water disappears quickly as the gas is released from the water.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Water Resource Authority. http://www.mwra.com/04water/2004/whitewater.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hot water supply==
{{Main|Hot water system}}
Domestic hot water is provided by means of [[water heater]] appliances, or through [[district heating]].  The hot water from these units is then piped to the various fixtures and appliances that require hot water, such as lavatories, sinks, bathtubs, showers, washing machines, and dishwashers.

==Fixtures and appliances==
Everything in a building that uses water falls under one of two categories; fixture or appliance.  As the consumption points above perform their function, most produce waste/sewage components that will require removal by the waste/sewage side of the system.  The minimum is an air gap. See [[cross connection control &amp; backflow prevention]] for an overview of backflow prevention methods and devices currently in use, both through the use of mechanical and physical principles.

Fixtures are devices that use water without an additional source of power.

==Fittings and valves==
{{main|Piping and plumbing fittings}}
Potable water supply systems are composed of [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s, [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]] and [[valve]]s.

==Materials==
The installation of water pipes can be done using the following plastic&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anr.gov.pl/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=83e2e56e-1518-4d72-bcfc-210de29a741a&amp;groupId=96805.|title=INSTALACJE WODOCIĄGOWE|last=|first=|date=2003|website=Anr.gov.pl|publisher=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and metal&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; materials:

===Plastic===
* polybutylene (PB)
* high density cross-linked polyethylene (PE-X)
* block copolymer of polypropylene (PP-B)
* the polypropylene copolymer (PP-H)
* random copolymer of polypropylene (random) (PP-R)
* Layer: cross-linked polyethylene, aluminum, high-density polyethylene (PE-X / Al / PE-HD)
* Layer: polyethylene crosslinked, aluminum, cross-linked polyethylene (PE-X / Al / PE-X)
* Layer copolymer of a random polypropylene, aluminum, polypropylene random copolymer (PP-R / Al / PP-R)
* polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated (PVC-C)
* polyvinyl chloride - not softened(only cold water) (PVC-U)

===Metals===
* carbon steel, ordinary galvanized
* corrosion resistant steel
* copper(Cu-DHP)
* Lead was previously used.

Other materials, if the pipes made from them have been let into circulation and the widespread use in the construction of the water supply systems.

==== Lead pipes ====
For many centuries, water pipes were made of lead, because of its ease of processing and durability. The use of lead pipes was a cause of health problems due to ignorance of the dangers of lead on the human body, which causes miscarriages and high death rates of newborns. Lead pipes, which were installed mostly in the late 1800s in the US, are still common today, much of which are located in the Northeast and the Midwest. Their impact is relatively small due to the fouling of pipes and stone cessation of the evolution of lead in the water; however, lead pipes are still detrimental. Most of the lead pipes that exist today are being removed and replaced with the more common material, copper or some type of plastic.

Remnants of pipes in some languages are the names of the experts involved in the execution, reparation, maintenance, and installation of water supply systems, which have been formed from the Latin word 'lead', English word 'plumber', French word, 'plombier'.

==Regulation and compliance==

===United States===
Before a water supply system is constructed or modified, the designer and contractor need to consult the local plumbing code and obtain a building permit prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;''Uniform Plumbing Code'', IAPMO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Plumbing Code'', ICC&lt;/ref&gt; Even replacing an existing water heater may require a permit and inspection of the work. The US national standard for potable water piping guidelines is NSF/ANSI 61 certified materials. NSF/ANSI also sets standards for certifying polytanks, though the FDA approves the materials. National and local fire codes should be integrated in the design phase of the water system too to prevent "failure to comply with regulations" notices. Some areas of the [[United States]] require on-site water reserves of potable and fire water by law.

==Wastewater==
{{main|Sewage treatment}}
[[Wastewater]] from various appliances, fixtures, and taps is transferred to the waste and sewage removal system via the [[sewerage|sewage drain]] system to [[sewage treatment|treatment plants]].  This system consists of larger diameter piping, [[backflow preventer|water traps]], and [[Plumbing drainage venting|ventilation]] to prevent toxic gases from entering the living space.

==Water flow reduction==
{{main|Water conservation}}
Water flow through a tap can be reduced by inexpensive small plastic flow reducers.  These restrict flow between 15 and 50%, aiding [[water conservation]] and reducing the burden on both [[water supply]] and [[sewerage treatment|treatment]] facilities.

==Comparison to bottled water==
{{Globalize|section|date=April 2010}}
{{See also|Bottled water#Bottled water versus tap water}}
In modern [[Western society]], levels of contaminants found in tap water vary for every household and plumbing system but tend to be low. Two general conceptions with popular appeal are:
# That tap water is widely contaminated 
# That bottled water is assuredly pure
Both lack scientific support. In reality, both tap water and bottled water are usually safe, although in both cases exceptions can occur. The University of Cincinnati recently completed a Tap Water Quality Analysis, funded by PUR, for major US cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uc.edu/gissa/projects/drinkingwater/ "Tap Water Quality Analysis"]&lt;/ref&gt; Its findings show generally safe [[water quality]] in most regions. While most US cities have what is considered safe tap water, contaminants ranging from bacteria to heavy metals are present in some tap water, and occasionally serious violations of tap water standards have been well-publicized, such as the severe 1993 [[Cryptosporidium]] outbreak in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], which led to several deaths and around 400,000 illnesses (see: [[Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak]]). Regarding bottled water quality perceptions and reality, in 1999, the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) released controversial findings from a 4-year study on bottled water. The results of this study claimed that one-third of the waters tested contained levels of contamination—including synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria, and arsenic—in at least one sample that exceeded allowable limits under either state or bottled water industry standards or guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/nbw.asp|title=NRDC: Summary Findings of NRDC's 1999 Bottled Water Report|work=nrdc.org|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bottled water industry was quick to dispute the claim, saying bottled water is one of the most highly regulated food products under the FDA regulatory authority and that the FDA system worked extremely well when coupled with the International Bottled Water Association's Model Code and unannounced inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottledwater.org/content/key-message-points|title=Key Message Points|work=bottledwater.org|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using tap water (whether straight from the tap or [[water filter|filtered]] first) is generally considered to be better for one's environmental impact than habitually drinking bottled water, because the bottling and distribution of bottled water consumes resources and produces emissions (electricity and oil to make the bottles, [[diesel fuel]] to truck the filled bottles through the supply chain, truck exhaust, powerplant emissions, bottle recycling, and so on). In comparison, the [[water treatment]] plant activities were going to happen anyway in either case, but the other costs and effects are avoided in the tap water case.

Many municipalities in the [[United States]] are making an effort to use tap water over bottled water on government properties and events. However, others voted the idea down, including voters in the state of Washington, who repealed a bottled water tax via citizen initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Washington's Gregoire plans 400 million more in budget cuts|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-12-16/washington-s-gregoire-plans-400-million-more-in-cuts.html|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Workman, author of the book ''Heart of Dryness: How the Last Bushmen Can Help Us Endure the Coming Age of Permanent Drought'' and co-founder of SmartMarkets says that he doesn't believe that "tap water is bad and bottled water is good".

Ukrain is named after the nation of [[Ukraine]] and is produced by the Austrian company Nowicky Pharma.

According to the [[American Cancer Society]] and the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], there is no evidence that Ukrain is an effective cancer treatment.

==Evidence==
In 2005, [[Edzard Ernst]] led a review into evidence of the effectiveness of Ukrain. Although the review found evidence suggesting the drug was effective, it also concluded that "numerous caveats prevent a positive conclusion".&lt;ref name=sr2005&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/1471-2407-5-69|year=2005|last1=Ernst|first1=E|last2=Schmidt|first2=K|journal=BMC Cancer|volume=5|pages=69|pmid=15992405|title=Ukrain - a new cancer cure? A systematic review of randomised clinical trials|pmc=1180428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the review some years later, Ernst wrote on his blog that the results they were examining had seemed "too good to be true"&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and on investigation the trials were very small in size, often seemed to include Novytskyi himself, and had significant methodological flaws. However, despite the cautious conclusion given, "this article became much cited. ... [Novytskyi] must have been delighted".&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt;

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center say that [[clinical trials]] have yet to prove safety and effectiveness of Ukrain.&lt;ref name=mskcc&gt;{{cite web
|publisher=[[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]]|title=Ukrain|url=http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/ukrain|date=September 2012
|accessdate=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Cancer Society stated that, as of 2013, "available scientific evidence does not support claims that celandine is effective in treating cancer in humans".&lt;ref name=acs/&gt; It may however be responsible for some adverse side-effects including [[hepatitis]] and allergic skin reactions.&lt;ref name=acs/&gt;

==Legal incidents==
Ukrain is not approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=mskcc/&gt; On September 4, 2012, several people including Vasyl Novytskyi, the drug's developer, were arrested in Austria for distributing the drug under suspicion of commercial fraud.&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2548611 Krebskranke getäuscht: Festnahmen], September 4, 2012 (orf.at)&lt;/ref&gt; Novytskyi appeared in Vienna regional court again in January 2015 for selling Ukrain, earning an estimated 1.1 million euros through fraud by changing labels on expired vials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ukrainian chemist lands in court for cancer 'cure'|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20150128/ukrainian-chemist-lands-in-court-for-cancer-cure|accessdate=20 October 2015|publisher=The Local|date=28 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, two co-defendants of Novytskyi were exonerated for commercial fraud, while legal proceedings continue for Novytskyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mitangeklagte in Prozess um angebliches Krebs-Heilmittel freigesprochen|url=http://derstandard.at/2000012542143/Mitangeklagte-Krebs-Heilmittel-verkauft-freigesprochen|accessdate=20 October 2015|publisher=derStandard.at|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 2013 to April 2014, a licensed [[naturopathy|naturopath]] in Tucson, Arizona, Michael Uzick, was using Ukrain in his practice to treat cancer patients. He was reported to the Arizona authorities by [[Britt Marie Hermes]], who discovered the drug was being illegally imported while working for Uzick.&lt;ref name="Thielking2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thielking|first1=Megan|title='Essentially witchcraft:' A former naturopath takes on the field|url=https://www.statnews.com/2016/10/20/naturopath-critic-britt-hermes/|accessdate=21 October 2016|work=[[The Boston Globe#Stat|STAT]]|date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uzick was given a letter of reprimand by the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board, which framed Uzick's misconduct as having "obtained the nutrient Ukrain not from a manufacturer registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration."&lt;ref name=uzick&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Michael Uzick  Disciplinary Actions|url=http://directorynd.az.gov/agency/pages/directorySearchDetail.asp?holderID=102|website=Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University hospitals of the Ruhr University of Bochum''', German ''Universitätsklinikum der Ruhr-Universität Bochum'', abbreviated ''UK RUB'' is a syndicate of six [[university hospitals]] and associated facilities of the [[Ruhr-Universität Bochum|Ruhr University of Bochum]]. Founded in 2008 by the merger of formally independent hospitals the UK RUB is now a major provider of health in the [[Ruhr]] Metropolitan Region treating over 400,000 patients per year with a strong commitment to research and teaching.

==History==

The ''Universitätsklinikum der Ruhr-Universität Bochum'' emerged from the [[Bochum Model]], where several non state-owned hospitals in [[Bochum]] and the surrounding metropolitan area were appointed as teaching hospitals. This appointment was first intended to be a temporary solution to financial shortages and political problems in the development of the [[medical faculty]] in Bochum in the 1970s, especially after the [[Universitätsklinikum Essen]] was spun off from the Ruhr University in 1972 and integrated into the newly formed [[University of Duisburg-Essen|Universität-Gesamthochschule Essen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Ferdinand Schöningh |isbn = 350671757X |publication-place = Paderborn, Germany |title = Geschichte der Inneren Medizin in Nordrhein-Westfalen |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL25227500M/Geschichte_der_Inneren_Medizin_in_Nordrhein-Westfalen |publication-date = 2004 |author1 = Georg Strohmeyer |author2 = Klaus Becker |author3 = Burkard May |id = 350671757X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the cooperation between appointed hospitals and Ruhr University was permanently established. This was in September 2008 the basis for the foundation of the ''Verband Klinikum der Ruhr-Universität Bochum'' with coordinating tasks in clinical, scientific and didactical fields.

'''Verus Pharmaceuticals''' was a privately held pharmaceutical company based in San Diego, California, USA. It was founded in November 2002 by three former Dura Pharmaceuticals executives, Bob Keith, Peter Schineller and Cam Garner, with an initial focus on the treatment of [[asthma]], [[allergies]] and related diseases and conditions, specifically in children. Verus is best known for its development and manufacturing of [[Twinject]], the first (and currently only) two-dose [[epinephrine]] [[autoinjector]]. The Twinject was latter licensed to [[Paladin Labs]] for manufacturing and distribution in Canada (released in September 2006.) The licence for manufacturing and distribution in Europe (and option for worldwide distribution) was sold to UCB.

Verus Pharmaceuticals was dissolved in March 2008 after selling its Twinject product to Sciele Pharma for $29 million.

The '''White House Iftar dinner''' is an annual reception held at the [[White House]] and hosted by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] and the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] to celebrate the [[Muslim]] month of [[Ramadan]]. The annual tradition started in 1996 when [[Hillary Clinton]] hosted a Ramadan [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]] celebration [[Iftar|dinner]]. The modern iteration of the reception is attended by prominent members of the [[Muslim American]] community including politicians, community leaders and students. 

[[Thomas Jefferson]] held the first White House dinner with a Muslim while hosting Sidi Soliman Mellimelli, an envoy of [[Beylik of Tunis]], on December 9, 1805, during the [[First Barbary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shellnutt |first=Kate |date=August 4, 2011 |title=Thomas Jefferson held first White House Ramadan celebration |website=IIP Digital |publisher=blog.chron.com |url=http://blog.chron.com/believeitornot/2011/08/thomas-jefferson-held-first-white-house-ramadan-celebrate/ |accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson adjusted the timing of the meal to after sunset to accommodate Sidi Soliman Mellimelli's Ramadan tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thomas Jefferson's Iftar |website=IIP Digital |publisher=U.S. Department of State |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/inbrief/2011/07/20110729153019kram0.3508199.html#ixzz1U4EHpDrE |accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
