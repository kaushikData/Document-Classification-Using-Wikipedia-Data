      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14341">An '''alluvial river''' is [[river]] in which the [[bed (river)|bed]] and [[stream bank|banks]] are made up of mobile [[sediment]] and/or [[soil]]. Alluvial rivers are self-formed, meaning that their [[Channel (geography)|channels]] are shaped by the magnitude and frequency of the [[flood]]s that they experience, and the ability of these floods to [[erosion|erode]], [[deposition (geology)|deposit]], and [[sediment transport|transport]] [[sediment]]. For this reason, alluvial rivers can assume a number of forms based on the properties of their banks; the flows they experience; the local riparian ecology; and the amount, size, and type of sediment that they carry.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Luna B., Wolman, M.G., and Miller, J.P., 1964, Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology, San Francisco, W.H. Freeman and Co., 522p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alluvial channel patterns ==
Natural alluvial channels have a variety of morphological patterns, but can be generally described as straight, [[meander]]ing, [[Braided river|braided]], or [[anastomosing]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bierman, R. B, David R. Montgomery (2014). Key Concepts in Geomorphology. W. H. Freeman and Company Publishers. United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Different channel patterns result from differences in [[bankfull discharge]], gradient, sediment supply, and bank material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Channel patterns can be described based on their level of [[sinuosity]], which is the ratio of the channel length measured along its center to the straight line distance measured down the valley axis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Straight/sinuous channels ===
Straight channels (sinuosity &lt;1.3) are relatively rare in natural systems due to the fact that sediment and flow are rarely distributed evenly across a landscape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Irregularities in the deposition and erosion of sediments leads to the formation of alternate bars that are on opposite sides of the channel in succession.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alternating bar sequences result in flow to be directed in a sinuous pattern, leading to the formation of sinuous channels (sinuosity of 1.3-1.5).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Meandering channels ===
Meandering channels are more sinuous (&gt;1.5 sinuosity) than straight or sinuous channels, and are defined by the [[meander]] [[wavelength]] morphological unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The meander wavelength is the distance from the apex of one bend to the next on the same side of the channel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meandering channels wavelength are described in section 1.2 Geomorphic Units.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meandering channels are widespread in current times, but no geomorphic evidence of their existence before the evolution of land plants has been found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is largely attributed to the effect of vegetation in increasing bank stability and maintaining meander formation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Braided channels ===
Braided channels are characterized by multiple, active streams within a broad, low sinuosity channel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The smaller strands of streams diverge around sediment bars and then converge in a braiding pattern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Braided channels are dynamic, with strands moving within the channel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Braided channels are caused by sediment loads that exceed the capacity of stream transport.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are found downstream of glaciers and mountain slopes in conditions of high slope, variable [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]], and high loads of coarse sediment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Anastomosing channels ===
[[Anastomosis|Anastomosing]] channels are similar to braided channels in that they are composed of complex strands that diverge and then converge downstream.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, anastomosing channels are distinct from braided channels in that they flow around relatively stable, typically vegetated islands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also have generally lower gradients, are narrower and deeper, and have more permanent strands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Geomorphic units ==

=== Meander wavelength ===
The [[meander]] [[wavelength]] or alternate bar sequence is considered the primary ecological and morphological unit of meandering alluvial rivers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Trush et al. (2000). Attributes of an Alluvial River and their Relation to Water Policy and Management. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Vol 92. No. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The meander wavelength is composed of two alternating bar units, each with a pool scoured out from a [[Cutbank River|cutbank]], an aggradational lobe or [[point bar]], and a [[riffle]] that connects the pool and point bar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In an idealized channel, the meander wavelength is around 10 to 11 channel widths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This equates to pools (and riffles and point bars) being separated by an average of 5 to 6 channel widths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The radius of curvature of a meander bend describes the tightness of a meander arc, and is measured by the radius of a circle that fits the meander arc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The radius of curvature is between 2 and 3 times the channel width.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Landforms ==

=== Floodplains ===
[[Floodplain]]s are the land areas adjacent to alluvial river channels that are frequently [[flood]]ed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Floodplains are built up by deposition of [[suspended load]] from overbank flow, [[Bed load|bedload]] deposition from lateral [[River channel migration|river migration]], and landscape processes such as [[landslide]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Natural levees ===
Natural [[levee]]s occur when the floodplain of an alluvial river is primarily shaped by overbank deposition and when relatively coarse materials are deposited near the main channel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The natural levees become higher than the adjacent floodplain, leading to the formation of backswamps and yazoo channels, in which [[tributary]] streams are forced to flow parallel to the main channel rather than converge with the main channel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Terraces ===
[[River terraces (tectonic–climatic interaction)|Terraces]] are sediment storage features that record an alluvial river’s past sediment delivery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many changes in boundary conditions can form terraces in alluvial river systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most basic reason for their formation is that the river does not have the transport capacity to move the sediment supplied to it by its [[Drainage basin|watershed]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Past climate during the [[Quaternary]] has been linked to the [[aggradation]] and incision of floodplains, leaving step-like terrace features behind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Orogeny|Uplift]] as well as sea level retreat can also cause terraces to form as the river cuts into its underlying bed and preserves sediment in its floodplain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Geomorphic processes ==

=== Natural hydrograph components ===
Natural [[hydrograph]] components such as storm events ([[flood]]s), baseflows, snowmelt peaks, and recession limbs, are the river-specific catalysts that shape alluvial river ecosystems and provide for important geomorphic and ecological processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Preserving annual variations in a river’s [[Hydrology|hydrologic]] regime – patterns of magnitude, duration, frequency, and timing of flows- are essential for sustaining ecological integrity within alluvial river ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Channel migration ===
Bank erosion at cutbanks on the outside of meanders combined with deposition of point bars on the inside of meanders cause [[River channel migration|channel migration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The greatest bank erosion often occurs just downstream of the meander apex, causing downstream migration as the high velocity flow eats away at the bank as it is forced around the meander curve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Avulsion (river)|Avulsion]] is another process of channel migration that occurs much more rapidly than the gradual migration process of cutbank erosion and point bar deposition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Avulsion occurs when lateral migration causes two meanders to become so close that the river bank between them is breached, causing the joining of the meanders and the creation of two channels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When the original channel is cut off from the new channel by the deposition of sediments, oxbow lakes are formed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Channel migration is important to sustaining diverse aquatic and riparian habitats&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The migration causes sediments and woody debris to enter the river, and creates areas of new floodplain on the inside of the meander.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sediment budgets ===
Dynamic steady states of sediment erosion and deposition work to sustain alluvial channel morphology, as river reaches import and export fine and coarse sediments at approximately equal rates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the apex of meander curves, high velocity flows scour out sediment and form pools.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The mobilized sediment is then deposited at the point bar directly across the channel or downstream.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Flows of high magnitude and duration can be seen as important thresholds that drive channelbed mobility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Channel [[aggradation]] or [[Degradation (geology)|degradation]] indicate sediment budget imbalances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Flooding ===
[[Flood]]ing is an important component that shapes channel morphology in alluvial river systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Large floods that exceed the 10 to 20 year recurrence interval form and maintain main channels as well as avulse and form side channels, [[wetland]]s, and [[oxbow lake]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Floodplain inundation occurs on average every 1–2 years at flows above bankfull stage and moderates flood severity and channel scour and helps to cycle nutrients between the river and surrounding landscape.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Flooding is important to aquatic and [[Riparian zone|riparian]] habitat complexity because it forms a diversity of habitat features that vary in their ecosystem function.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Biologic components ==

=== Riparian habitats ===
Riparian habitats are especially dynamic in alluvial river ecosystems due to the constantly changing [[fluvial]] environment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alternate bar scour, channel migration, floodplain inundation, and channel avulsion create variable habitat conditions that riparian vegetation must adapt to.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Seedling establishment and forest stand development depend on favorable substrate, which in turn is dependent on how sediment is sorted along the channel banks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In general, young riparian vegetation and [[pioneer species]] will establish in areas that are subjected to active channel processes such as at point bars, where coarser sediments such as gravels and cobbles are present but are seasonally mobilized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mature riparian vegetation can establish farther upslope where finer sediments such as sands and silts dominate and disturbance from active river processes are less frequent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Aquatic habitats ===
Aquatic habitats in alluvial rivers are sculpted by the complex interplay between sediment, flow, vegetation, and [[Large woody debris|woody debris]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pools provide deeper areas of relatively cool water and provide shelter for fish and other aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pool habitats are improved by complex structures such as [[large woody debris]] or boulders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Riffle]]s provide shallower, highly turbulent aquatic habitat of primarily cobbles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Here, water mixes with the air at the water surface, increasing dissolved oxygen levels within the stream. [[Benthic zone|Benthic]] [[macroinvertebrates]] thrive in riffles, living on the surfaces and interstitial spaces between rocks. Many species also depend on low energy backwater areas for feeding and important life cycle stages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Human impacts ==

=== Land use impacts ===

==== Logging ====
[[Logging]] of timberland in alluvial watersheds has been shown to increase sediment yields to rivers, causing aggradation of the streambed, increasing turbidity, and altering sediment size and sediment distribution along the channel. The increase in sediment yield is attributed to increased runoff and erosion and slope failure, a result of removing vegetation from the landscape as well as building roads.

==== Agriculture ====
Agricultural land uses divert water from alluvial rivers for crop production, as well constrain the river’s ability to meander or migrate due levee construction or other forms of armoring. The result is simplified channel morphology with lower baseflows.

=== Dams and diversions ===
Dams and diversions alter the natural hydrologic regime of rivers, with widespread effects that alter the watershed ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Poff, N. L., Allan, J. D., Bain, M. B., Karr, J. R., Prestegaard, K. L., Richter, B. D., Stromberg, J. C. (1997). The Natural Flow Regime. BioScience, 47(11), 769–784. http://doi.org/10.2307/1313099&lt;/ref&gt; Since alluvial river morphology and fluvial ecosystem processes are largely shaped by the complex interplay of hydrograph components such as the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change of flow, any change in one of these components can be associated with a tangible alteration of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dams are often associated with reduced wet season flood magnitudes and altered (oftentimes reduced) dry season baseflow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can negatively affect aquatic organisms that are specifically evolved to natural flow conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By altering the natural hydrograph components, particularly reducing flow magnitudes, dams and other diversions reduce the river’s ability to mobilize sediment, resulting in sediment-choked channels.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kondolf, M. G. (1997) Hungry Water: Effects of Dams and Gravel Mining on River Channels. Environmental Management Vol. 21, No. 4, pp. 533–551&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, dams are a physical barrier to the naturally continuous movement of sediment from headwaters to the river mouth, and can create sediment deficient conditions and incision directly downstream.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

{{About|one of the five major circles of latitude}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Arctic circle.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Arctic]], with the Arctic Circle in blue and the July 10&amp;nbsp;°C mean [[Contour line#Temperature and related subjects|isotherm]] in red{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}]]

The '''Arctic Circle''' is the [[polar circle|most northerly]] of the five major [[circle of latitude|circles]] of [[latitude]] as shown on [[map]]s of [[Earth]]. It marks the northernmost point at which the centre of the [[noon]] sun is just visible on the [[December solstice]] and the southernmost point at which the centre of the [[midnight sun]] is just visible on the [[June solstice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burn|first=Chris|title=The Polar Night|url=http://nwtresearch.com/sites/default/files/the-polar-night.pdf|publisher=The Aurora Research Institute|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NB: This refers to the true geometric centre which actually appears higher in the sky because of refraction by the atmosphere.&lt;/ref&gt; The region north of this circle is known as the [[Arctic]], and the zone just to the south is called the [[temperateness|Northern Temperate Zone]].

As seen from the Arctic, the [[Sun]] is above the [[horizon]] for 24 continuous [[hour]]s at least once per year (and therefore visible at [[midnight]]) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least once per year (and therefore not visible at [[noon]]). This is also true in the [[Antarctic]] region, south of the equivalent [[Antarctic Circle]].

The position of the Arctic Circle is not fixed; as of {{TODAY}}, it runs {{circle of latitude|polar}} north of the [[Equator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.neoprogrammics.com/obliquity_of_the_ecliptic/ |title = Obliquity of the Ecliptic (Eps Mean) |publisher = Neoprogrammics.com |date =  |accessdate = 13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its latitude depends on the Earth's [[axial tilt]], which [[axial precession|fluctuates]] within a margin of more than 2° over a 41,000-year period, due to [[tidal force]]s resulting from the [[orbit of the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Berger |first = A. L. |date = 1976 |title = Obliquity and Precession for the Last 5000000 Years |journal = [[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume = 51 |issue =  |pages = 127–135 |bibcode = 1976A&amp;A....51..127B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Arctic Circle is currently [[Circle of latitude#Movement of the Tropical and Polar Circles|drifting northwards]] at a speed of about {{convert|15|m|abbr=off}} per year.

==Etymology==
The word ''arctic'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ἀρκτικός (''arktikos'': "near [[Ursa Major|the Bear]], northern")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1-link = Henry Liddell |first1 = Henry |last1 = Liddell |author2-link = Robert Scott (philologist) |first2 = Robert |last2 = Scott |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315193 |title = Arktikos |work = [[A Greek–English Lexicon]] |publisher = [[Perseus Project|Perseus Digital Library]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that from the word ἄρκτος (''arktos'': "[[bear]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1 = Henry |last1 = Liddell |first2 = Robert |last2 = Scott |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315199 |title = Arktos |work = A Greek–English Lexicon |publisher = Perseus Digital Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Midnight sun and polar night==
[[File:axial_tilt_vs_tropical_and_polar_circles.svg|thumb|400px|Relationship of Earth's axial tilt (&amp;#949;) to the tropical and polar circles]]
{{Further|Midnight sun|Polar night}}
The Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] at which the centre of the sun can remain continuously above or below the horizon for twenty-four hours; as a result, at least once each year at any location within the Arctic Circle the sun is [[Midnight sun|visible at local midnight]], and at least once the centre is [[Polar night|not visible at local noon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Burn |first = Chris |title = The Polar Night |url = http://nwtresearch.com/sites/default/files/the-polar-night.pdf |publisher = The Aurora Research Institute |accessdate = 28 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Directly on the Arctic Circle these events occur, in principle, exactly once per year: at the [[June solstice|June]] and [[December solstice|December]] [[solstice]]s, respectively. However, because of [[atmospheric refraction]] and [[mirage]]s, and also because the sun appears as a disk and not a point, part of the midnight sun may be seen on the night of the northern [[summer solstice]] up to about 50 [[Minute and second of arc|minutes (′)]] ({{convert|90|km|abbr=on}}) south of the Arctic Circle; similarly, on the day of the northern [[winter solstice]], part of the sun may be seen up to about 50′ north of the Arctic Circle. That is true at [[sea level]]; those limits increase with elevation above sea level, although in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the true horizon.

==Human habitation==
[[Image:World map with arctic circle.svg|thumb|Cylindrical projection showing the Arctic Circle in red]]
{{Further|Arctic peoples}}
Only four million people live north of the Arctic Circle due to the [[Climate of the Arctic|severe climate]]; nonetheless, some areas have been settled for thousands of years by [[indigenous peoples]], who today make up 10% of the region's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.athropolis.com/arctic-facts/fact-arctic-pop.htm |title = Arctic Population |website = www.athropolis.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands of years ago, waves of people migrated from eastern Siberia across the [[Bering Strait]] into North America to settle.

The largest communities north of the Arctic Circle are situated in [[Russia]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]: [[Murmansk]] (population 307,257), [[Norilsk]] (175,365), [[Tromsø]] (71,295), [[Vorkuta]] (59,231) and [[Kiruna]] (18,148). [[Rovaniemi]] (61,329) in [[Finland]] is the largest settlement in the immediate vicinity of the Arctic Circle, lying {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the line.

In contrast, the largest North American community north of the Arctic Circle, [[Sisimiut]] ([[Greenland]]), has approximately 5,000 inhabitants. Of the [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[United States|American]] Arctic communities, [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]] is the largest settlement with about 4,000 inhabitants.

==Geography==
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
[[Image:Artic countries.png|thumb|The countries transcending the Arctic Circle]]
The Arctic Circle is roughly {{Convert|16000|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Nuttall |first1 = Mark |title = Encyclopedia of the Arctic Volumes 1, 2 and 3 |date = 2004 |publisher = Routledge |isbn = 978-1579584368 |page = 115 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Swr9BTI_2FEC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115 |accessdate = 26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area north of the Circle is about {{Convert|20000000|km2|abbr=on}} and covers roughly 4% of Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = William M. |last1 = Marsh |first2 = Martin M. |last2 = Kaufman |title = Physical Geography: Great Systems and Global Environments |url = https://books.google.com/?id=uF3aJSC20yMC&amp;pg=PA24 |year = 2012 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |isbn = 978-0-521-76428-5 |page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic Circle passes through the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], [[North Asia]], [[Northern America]] and [[Greenland]]. The land within the Arctic Circle is divided among 8 countries: [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Canada]] ([[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]), [[Denmark]] (Greenland) and [[Iceland]] (where it passes through the small offshore island of [[Grímsey]]).

===Climate===
{{Further|Climate of the Arctic}}
The climate inside the Arctic Circle is generally cold, but the coastal areas of Norway have a generally mild climate as a result of the [[Gulf Stream]], which makes the ports of northern Norway and northwest Russia ice-free all year long. In the interior, summers can be quite warm, while winters are extremely cold. For example, summer temperatures in [[Norilsk]], Russia will sometimes reach as high as {{convert|30|C}}, while the winter temperatures frequently fall below {{convert|-50|C}}.

===Sites along the Arctic Circle===

[[Image:Chinle Badlands.jpg|thumb|right|The Chinle Badlands at [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]] in southern [[Utah]]]]
'''Badlands''' are a type of dry terrain where softer sedimentary rocks and [[clay]]-rich [[soil]]s have been extensively [[Erosion|eroded]] by wind and water.&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;"Badlands" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 2, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; They are characterized by steep slopes, minimal vegetation, lack of a substantial [[regolith]], and high drainage density.&lt;ref name="A.D. Abrahams, Editors 2009"&gt;A.J. Parsons and A.D. Abrahams, Editors (2009) ''Geomorphology of Desert Environments'' (2nd ed.) Springer Science &amp; Business Media {{ISBN|978-1402057182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can resemble [[Malpaís (landform)|malpaís]], a terrain of volcanic rock. [[Canyon]]s, [[ravine]]s, [[gully|gullies]], [[butte]]s, [[mesa]]s, [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoo]]s and other such [[geologic]] forms are common in badlands. They are often difficult to navigate by foot. Badlands often have a spectacular color display that alternates from dark black/blue coal stria to bright clays to red [[scoria]].

==Composition==
Badlands are partially characterized by their thin to nonexistent [[regolith]] layers. The regolith profiles of badlands in arid climates are likely to resemble one another.&lt;ref name="A.D. Abrahams, Editors 2009"/&gt;  In these regions, the upper layer (~1–5&amp;nbsp;cm) is typically composed of [[silt]], [[shale]], and [[sand]] (a byproduct of the weathered shale).  This layer can form either a compact crust or a looser, more irregular aggregation of "popcorn" fragments.  Located beneath  the top layer is a sublayer (~5–10&amp;nbsp;cm), below which can be found a transitional shard layer (~10–40&amp;nbsp;cm), formed largely of loose disaggregated shale chips, which in turn eventually gives way to a layer of unweathered shale.  Badlands such as those found in the [[Mancos Shale]], the [[Brule Formation]], the [[Chadron Formation]], and the [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] can be generally said to fit this profile.

In less arid regions, the regolith profile can vary considerably. Some badlands have no regolith layer whatsoever, capping instead in bare rock such as [[sandstone]]. Others have a regolith with a clay veneer, and still others have a biological crust of [[algae]] or [[lichen]]s.&lt;ref name="A.D. Abrahams, Editors 2009"/&gt;

In addition to lacking significant regolith, they also lack much [[vegetation]]. The lack of vegetation could very well be a result of the lack of a substantial regolith.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, R. and A. Yair, 1982a. Perspectives on studies of badland geomorphology. In ''Badland geomorphology and piping''. R. Bryan and A. Yair (eds), 1-3. Norwich: Geo Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The formation of badlands is a result of two processes: [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] and [[erosion]]. The process of deposition describes the accumulation, over time, of layers of mineral material.  Different environments such as seas, rivers, or tropical zones, deposit different sorts of clays, silts, and sand. For instance, the badlands formations in Badlands National Park, South Dakota, United States underwent a 47-million year period of deposition which spanned three major geologic periods (the [[Cretaceous Period]], the [[Late Eocene]], and the [[Oligocene|Oligocene Epochs]]), resulting in clear, distinct layers of sediment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Badlands National Park South Dakota. |date=November 7, 2013|url= http://www.nps.gov/badl/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which serve as a dramatic display of the [[law of superposition]].  Once the deposited sediments have solidified, the sedimentary material becomes subject to erosion. It is sometimes erroneously taught that badlands erode at a steady rate of about one inch per year.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/badl/researchers-study-badlands-erosion-rates.htm|title=Badlands Erosion Rates}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In actuality, the precise processes by which the erosion responses take place vary depending on the precise interbedding of the sedimentary material.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, D. (2011). Arid zone geomorphology: Process, form and change in drylands. (3rd ed.). Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, researchers at Badlands National Park initiated a three-year project to learn more about the actual erosion rate of the specific badlands found in that park.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt;

==Locations==
[[Image:Toadstool Geologic Park.jpg|right|thumb|[[Toadstool Geologic Park]] in northwestern [[Nebraska]]]]
Some of the best-known badland formations can be found in Canada and the United States. In the U.S., [[Makoshika State Park]] in [[Montana]] and [[Badlands National Park]] in [[South Dakota]] together form a series of extensive badland formations. Also located in this region is [[Theodore Roosevelt National Park]], a United States National Park composed of three geographically separated areas of badlands in western [[North Dakota]] named after former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. [[Petrified Forest National Park]] in [[Arizona]] which is part of [[Navajo County]] encompasses numerous bad lands that also abuts the [[Navajo]] Indian Reservation and is directly North of [[Joseph City, Arizona]]. Many [[dinosaur]]s are believed to be buried in the immediate area and current exploration has just recently been conducted. 

Among the [[Henry Mountains]] area, about 1500m above sea level, [[Cretaceous]] and [[Jurassic]] aged shales are exposed. Another popular area of badland formations is [[Toadstool Geologic Park]] in the [[Oglala National Grassland]] located in northwestern [[Nebraska]]. [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in Colorado and Utah are also badlands settings, along with several other areas in southern Utah, such as the Chinle Badlands in [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]]. A small badland called [[Hell's Half Acre (Wyoming)|Hell's Half-Acre]] is present in [[Natrona County]], [[Wyoming]]. Additional badlands also exist in various places throughout southwest Wyoming, such as near [[Pinedale, Wyoming|Pinedale]] and in the [[Bridger Valley, Wyoming|Bridger Valley]] near the towns of [[Lyman, Wyoming|Lyman]] and [[Mountain View, Wyoming|Mountain View]], near the high [[Uintah Mountains]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} [[Pinnacles National Park]] in California also has areas of badlands, as does the [[Mojave Desert]] in [[eastern California]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

[[El Malpais National Monument]] in western [[New Mexico]] is named after the Spanish word ''malpaís'', meaning bad lands.

The [[Big Muddy Badlands]] in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], gained notoriety as a hideout for [[outlaw]]s. There is a large badland area in [[Alberta]], Canada, particularly in the valley of the [[Red Deer River]], where [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] is located, as well as in [[Drumheller]], where The [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]] is located.
[[File:Calanco1.jpg|thumbnail|The "Calanchi" of [[Aliano]], in the Italian region of [[Basilicata]]]]
A well-known badlands formation in [[New Zealand]] – the [[Putangirua Pinnacles]], formed by the erosion of the [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] of an old [[alluvial fan]] – is located at the head of a small valley near the southern tip of the [[North Island]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Other badlands can be found in [[Italy]], known as "Calanchi". Some examples include [[Aliano]], [[Basilicata]], and [[Crete Senesi]], [[Tuscany]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The [[Bardenas Reales]] near [[Tudela, Navarre]], and the [[Tabernas Desert]] in [[Tabernas, Almería]], and possible [[Los Monegros]] in [[Aragon]], all of them in [[Spain]], are examples in [[Europe]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The [[Valle de la Luna (Argentina)|Valle de la Luna]] ("Valley of the Moon") is one of many examples of badland formations in midwestern [[Argentina]]. This geologic formation is the only place in the world where nearly all of the [[Triassic]] is represented in an undisturbed sequence of rock deposits.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Although most badland scenery is natural, there are some examples produced by mining, such as the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] gold mine of [[Las Médulas]] in northern Spain. An example of badlands produced by [[Land degradation|poor farming practices]] is the [[Cheltenham Badlands]] in [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]], Ontario.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8758">Three components that are included in the load of a river system are the following: [[dissolved load]], wash load and bed material load. The '''bed material load''' is the portion of the [[sediment]] that is [[sediment transport|transported]] by a stream that contains material derived from the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-81-224-1270-3|author1=R.J. Garde |author2=K.G. Ranga Raju. |year=2000|page=262|publisher=New Age International|location=New Delhi|title=Mechanics of sediment transportation and alluvial stream problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bed material load typically consists of all of the [[bed load]], and the proportion of the [[suspended load]] that is represented in the [[river bed|bed]] sediments. It generally consists of grains coarser than 0.062&amp;nbsp;mm with the principal source being the channel bed. Its importance lies in that its composition is that of the bed, and the material in transport can therefore be actively interchanged with the bed. For this reason, bed material load exerts a control on river channel morphology. Bed load and [[wash load]] (the sediment that rides high in the flow and does not extract non-negligible momentum from it) together constitute the total load of sediment in a stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belperio|first1=A|title=The combined use of wash load and bed material load rating curves for the calculation of total load: An example from the Burdekin River, Australia|journal=CATENA|volume=6|issue=3-4|pages=317–329|year=1979|doi=10.1016/0341-8162(79)90027-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order in which the three components of load have been considered – dissolved, wash, bed material – can be thought of as progression: of increasingly slower transport velocities, so that the load peak lags further and further behind the flow peak during any event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Fluvial Forms and Processes: A New Perspective|last = Knighton|first = David|publisher = John Wiley and Sons Inc.|year = 1998|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sediment Transport ==

Bed-material load is composed of larger grains than any of the other loads. The rate in which grains travel is dependent on the transporting capacity of the flow. Particles move by rolling, sliding, or saltation (bouncing or jumping of grains) at velocities less than that of the surrounding flow. Rolling is the primary mode of transport in gravel-bed streams, while saltation in which grains hop over the bed in a series of low trajectories is largely restricted to sands and small gravels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Various equations are used to estimate the rate at which sediments are transported through the fluvial system. Bed-material discharge equations generally are applicable only within the range of flow conditions and sediment sizes for which the equations were derived.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measurement and computation of bed-material discharge in a shallow sand-bed stream, Muddy Creek, Wyoming|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR017i001p00131/abstract|journal = Water Resources Research|date = 1981-02-01|issn = 1944-7973|pages = 131–141|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1029/WR017i001p00131|language = en|first = E.

'''–''' Channel geometry: ''b'' (width of the channel), ''y'' (flow depth) and BF (bed form of the channel)

'''–''' Dynamic properties: ''Q\'' (channel discharge), ''Sf'' (friction''/''energy slope), ''τb'' (bed shear stress) and ''τc'' (critical shear stress or Shields’ shear stress)

'''–''' Sediment properties: ''d'' (mean size of sediment), ''σ'' (gradation coefficient of the sediment particles) and ''Gs'' (specific gravity)

'''–''' Fluid properties: ''ν'' (viscosity)

Bed material load transport (''C'') is a function of all the above parameters, i.e.:

''C'' = ''f (b'', ''y'', BF, ''Q'', ''Sf'' , ''τ''b, ''τ''c, ''d'', ''σ'',''Gs'', ''ν)''

Knowledge of sediment transport is important to such endeavors as river restoration, ecosystem protection, navigation, and infrastructure management.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Measurement of Bedload Transport in Sand-Bed Rivers:   A Look at Two Indirect Sampling Methods |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5091/papers/Holmes.pdf |website=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=2015-12-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021125755/http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5091/papers/Holmes.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurements ==

Direct and indirect methods are two ways in which bed material can be measured. Direct measurement is done through the use of a physical trap, placing the device in contact with the bed, “allowing the sediment transported as bedload to accumulate (or be trapped) inside the sampler for a certain amount of time, after which the sampler is raised to the surface and the material is emptied and weighed to determine a weight transported per unit time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There are three types of direct samplers, which include a box or basket, pan or tray, and pressure difference as described by Hubbell (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apparatus and Techniques for Measuring Bedload |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/1748/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118035650/https://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/1748/report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-11-18 |website=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=2015-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of bedload discharge are rare and frequently of unknown accuracy because no bedload sampler has been extensively tested and calibrated over a wide range of hydraulic conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The box sampler has an opening that allows sediment to enter, the pan or tray samplers are placed in front of the open front of a box, and the pressure difference sampler is made to produce a pressure drop at the end of the nozzle. Accurate field measurements are very difficult to make, errors principally associated with the measuring devices themselves and with the extreme temporal variations in transport rate, which are a characteristic feature of bed material movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bed load sampling and analysis|last = Hubbell|first = D.W.|publisher = Wiley|year = 1987|isbn = |location = Chichestre|pages = 89–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Bedload transport|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001282529190017A||accessdate = 2015-12-17|doi = 10.1016/0012-8252(91)90017-A|volume=31|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|pages=89–132|bibcode=1991ESRv...31...89G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect measurements can be performed by a tracer, repeated channel surveys, bedform velocimetry, or velocimetry. No one method is entirely satisfactory, but indirect channel surveys, provided they are detailed enough at the reach scale, can produce reliable results, and have the advantages of minimum disturbance to the flow and time-integrated sampling which averages out short-term fluctuations in the transport rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Morphological estimation of the time-integrated bedload transport rate|last = Lane, S.N  |author2=Richards, K.S. |author3=Chandler, J.H. |last-author-amp=yes |date = 1995|journal = Water Resource Research |pages= 761-72|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==

Bed-material exerts a control on river channel morphology. The bed material load transport in alluvial rivers is the principal link between river hydraulics and river form&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The potential rate of bed-load transport|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/46/17170|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2006-11-14|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 1859904|pmid = 17088528|pages = 17170–17173|volume = 103|issue = 46|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0608487103|language = en|first = Basil|last = Gomez|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10317170G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is responsible for building and maintaining the channel geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analytical Solutions for Estimating Effective Discharge|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2004)130:8(729)|journal = Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|date = 2004-01-01|issn = 0733-9429|pages = 729–738|volume = 130|issue = 8|doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2004)130:8(729)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boštjan Burger''' (born 1966) is a [[Slovenia]]n [[informatics (academic field)|informatician]], [[geographer]], a panoramic and VR panoramic photographer and a [[speleologist]]. He was founder of the Burger.si website and had retired as computer programmer in the 1990s to become a geographic researcher on the hydrology of waterfalls. He used [[VR panorama]]s as a tool in the research of [[landscape]]s. He was greatly influenced by geographer [[Don Bain]] for [[document]]ing the landscape with VR panoramas and [[Hans Nyberg]] for his use of [[QuickTime]] VR fullscreen panoramas.

His first [[360 degrees|360°]] pictures – so called: [[Cyclorama]]s, were taken with [[Black-and-white|BW]] [[negative film]] in 1982.

*In 1989 he has created a [[computer program]] with an [[algorithm]] for assembling different types of crosswords, [[Word square]]s from 6x6 to 10x10 and no blank filled crosswords – [[Word rectangle]]s 6x6. His crosswords were published in renovated Slovenian [[enigmatic magazine]]s ([[Kih]], [[Ugankarski domenek]], …) in a period from 1989 to 1992.
*[[Virtual museum]] [[Ljubljana]]: [[Open-Air Museum]] — founded by Boštjan Burger in 1993 and online 1996. Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia was presented as a huge museum where streets were the expositions of the [[architecture]] and building interiors were museum rooms. The method of the presentation were interactive maps and interactive historical relations between locations of Ljubljana documented with photos and later with Virtual Reality panoramas. In 1999 Ljubljana municipality co-founded a one-year development of the Burger's Virtual museum Ljubljana.
*In June 1996 Boštjan Burger became involved in the creation of 'Slovenia Land of [[Waterfall]]s', which was launched on the [[Internet]] after 15 years of researching the [[hydrology]] of the waterfalls of Slovenia. Over 300 separate waterfalls were recorded with complete data and visual information on each waterfall - the majority of which were presented and documented in VR. And so the project went on to create other VR intensive initiatives.
*In 1997 the [[Virtual Reality Panorama]] project: Landmarks was started to create a striking visual presentation using Virtual Reality Panoramas. The Virtual Tour was very effective in showcasing locations like caves, deep gorges and mountain peaks, as well as towns, museums, castles, and national parks and ethnology. More than 11,000 VR Panoramas have been created for the project so far.
*The CD-ROM 'Waterfalls of [[Triglav National Park]]' was published 1998, and covered the entire area of the National Park with permanent waterfalls. The multimedia guide consisted of descriptions of waterfalls, accesses, GPS location, maps, interactive photos, QTVR's and 61 min. of VHS quality movies of waterfalls on a single CD. Many of the CD's were donated to Slovenian schools and incorporated into the Geography curriculum.
*In 1998&amp;ndash;1999 the first [[virtual tour]] like [[street view]] with [[virtual reality panorama]]s with 400  virtual reality panoramas as part of Virtual museum Ljubljana was realised in [[Ljubljana]] (Slovenia).
*The 'Virtual guide to Slovenian Museums' began in March 2000, and the funding has continued into 2004. Many Slovenian cultural locations are represented, which are in turn connected to a virtual guide of each museum. Currently 106 museum exhibitions are presented within this project.
*Year 2000: The project of the [[Krško]] [[Nuclear power plant]] [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generator]]s replacement took place and Burger has realized the documentation and visualization of the interior of the Nuclear power plant including a [[cooling water pool]]s system which removes heat from the [[reactor core]]. The visualization was used as a learning tool to display processes in the nuclear plant.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402160726/http://ocs-v3.ibe.si/portal/page?_pageid=54%2C128888&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL]
*In September 2000, the newly initiated '[[Karst]] Project' began to organize and photograph the [[cave system]]s of [[Postojna Cave]] and Škocjan Caves (Slovenia), so that people worldwide could admire this beauty without intruding in droves on the delicate [[ecosystem]].

*[[European schoolnet]]: 'Use of Internet and new technologies in schools'; from 4–11 May 2001 in [[Stockholm]]. [[Ministry (collective executive)|Ministry]] of Education, Science and Sport of Slovenia has nomitnated Burger's photo virtual reality project "Images from Slovenia" to this European school projects. Teachers, educators, and researchers with extensive [[experience]] in educational [[technology]] have chosen their favourite examples and methods. Teachers and schools in all four corners of Europe made the most of their choice and the project was chosen as one of "favourites". (E-schola: [http://www.eun.org E-schola ]).
*July 2001: [[CD-ROM]]: the "Galop company" completed Project [[Leon Štukelj]] – Image of Slovenia. The goal of the project was to present Slovenian Olympic athlet] Leon Štukelj and promote Slovenia. Data from Burger's project 'Images from Slovenia' was used for this project.
*Presentation of Slovenian museums and galleries in [[Barcelona]], Spain: for that event Burger published Interactive virtual guide to selected museums of Slovenia on CD-rom. The images and Virtual Reality panoramas from the virtual guide were used as a background projection on that [[Academic conference|conference]].
*[[Presentation]] of Republic Of Slovenia as a country of three regions in [[Bruxelless]]. (Ministry of Education, Science and Sport). For this event Burger has published a CD-rom presentation with VR panoramas of Slovenia which covered the background of the conference.
* Year 2002: Visualisation of touristic, economic and cultural centers in Slovenia. It was the cooperation with the Slovenian municipalities of: [[Lendava]], [[Murska Sobota]], [[Ptuj]], [[Velenje]], [[Škofja Loka]], [[Koper]], [[Bled]] and [[Kranjska Gora]]. Virtual guides to each centre was presented and published within the official URLs and CD media.
* Year 2003: Burger's cooperation with the [[Slovenian Tourist Board]] and visualisation of tourist destination points of the complete territory of Slovenia.
* Boštjan Burger presented at international educational conference [[MIRK]] in Piran, the use of the technology and computer at the educational process. Project of visualisation of cultural and geographical locations as an example of [[accessibility]] to [[disabled person]]s and as a [[wikt:showcase|showcase]] of the [[virtual exploration]] at the geography lessons.
* Three [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]] International Committees (CIMUSET, ICTOP and MPR). Burger with the cooperation of Associatoion of Museums of Slovenia and Ministry of Culture of Slovenia published a CD-rom with Virtual Reality presentation which was also a background projection within the conferences.
* In a winter 2003/2004 virtual [[skiing]] of [[ski centre]]s of [[Krvavec]] [http://www.burger.si/KSA/Krvavec/360_Krvavec_01.html], [[Kranjska Gora]], [[Vogel]] [http://www.burger.si/TriglavNationalPark/Vogel/Vogel_01.html], [[Kanin (mountain)|Kanin]] and [[Ski centre Cerkno]] [http://www.ski-cerkno.com/virtual-skiing-centre] were realised.

*In 2004 the first commercial GIS application with the use of georeferenced Burgers Virtual Reality panoramas was used in the application Interactive Atlas of Slovenia made by Globalvision and published by Mladinska Knjiga. Same year the interactive VR panoramas were implemented into the java application for the mobile phones and used by the largest mobile company in Slovenia.
* Invitation and participation of Boštjan Burger's web project 'Slovenia Landmarks' at (FILE) ELECTRONIC LANGUAGE INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL in [[São Paulo]] - Brazil. The invited works were result from a deep research that the organizers have done on the web and through this research; the organisators discovered the importance to have references showing during the festival. In that sense they had no doubt that project Slovenia Landmarks was a value contribution to the show as one of the reference of the media art evolution. The invited works were displayed in a special section in the website and in the exhibition.
*Boštjan Burger has used the method of documentation with Virtual Reality panoramas and worked with [[International Tourism Institute]], Ljubljana at the cultural project [[GOTHICmed]]: A Virtual Museum of Mediterranean [[Gothic architecture]] - [[Culture 2000]], Action 2, cultural heritage, call 2004. The goals of the project GOTHICmed, which emphasises the importance of the common knowledge and [[cultural heritage]], are the [[inventory]] of Gothic architecture in the Mediterranean.
*Year 2005: Boštjan Burger documented and made an interactive visual presentation of over 200 monuments including the [[All Saints Garden]] (designed by architect [[Jože Plečnik]]) in [[Ljubljana]]'s cemetery »Žale« which was a member of [[The Association of Significant Cemeteries in Europe]] (ASCE). [http://www.zale.si/sl/Prostorski_posnetki/], [http://www.significantcemeteries.org/].
*Year 2006: Boštjan Burger cooperated with the project "Slovenia Your Cooperation Partner - SYCP. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110917055711/http://www.sycp.si/Credits.aspx]
*In 2007, after three years of the study and ground photographic work Boštjan Burger completed a comprehensive [[Virtual museum]] of [[Jože Plečnik]], a Slovene architect who practised in [[Vienna]], [[Belgrade]], [[Prague]] and [[Ljubljana]]. The mission of the virtual museum was an [[e-learning]] tool for students of architecture worldwide.
*He has developed and fine-tuned a method of [[light-painting]] to illuminate large caverns. In November 2010 he started important subterranean project which was 500 meters below ground in the methane gas polluted environment of a [[coal mine]] at [[Velenje]] in Slovenia. Between November 2010 and March 2011 he documented important coal mining [[Process (engineering)|process]]es using virtual reality panoramas, and presented all the collected visual data in an [[e-learning]] "classroom".
*On the international [[panoramic photography]] festival and exhibitions being held in [[Palmela]] in June 1-5th 2011, Boštjan Burger featured in this exhibit and has been chosen for his special contributions to the field as the master of the [[contemporary panoramic photography]].
*In July 2011, Boštjan Burger has been threatened by the Slovenian [[Information commissioner]] to [[Focus (computing)|blur]] the faces of all people shown in public areas on his personal, non-commercial website, or otherwise he would have to take down all 11,000 VR Panoramas on his [[website]] showing people or other identifying features (building numbers, license plates, etc.) that were taken in Slovenia, or face fine or imprisonment. The cause for the threat from Information commissioner was unclear as he was ordered to blur or delete images, no matter when taken, even before Slovenia became independent country. [http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/18/slovenian-government-orders-photog-to-take-down-11000-photos/] His case was a precedence in a contemporary photography.

The '''Cartographic Acquisition Research Teaching and Exhibition Museum''' (CARTE – the [[French language|French]] word for map) was a small privately owned [[Cartography|cartographic]] museum located in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], dedicated to the preservation of original maps and atlases. The collection documented early North American continent exploration, centered on the present-day [[Louisiana]] [[Gulf Coast]] from the 1500s up to the appearance of aerial cartography in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Mapping History," Greg Langley. [[The Advocate (Louisiana)|''The Advocate Magazine'']], July 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owner David Morgan closed the collection of maps to the public in 2017, citing economic downturn. The collection was disposed of by auction in blocks.

==The collection==
The collection included maps by [[Guillaume Delisle|Guillaume de L’Isle]], [[Louis Joliet|Louis Jolliet]], Nicolas de Fer, [[Joutel, Quebec|Henri Joutel]], [[Barthelemy Lafon]], William Darby, and John La Tourrette. Most maps exhibited original hand color or color lithography and were accompanied by written explanations highlighting important changes or features on individual maps. Approximately 30 maps were on display at any given time and grouped together by common theme.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5936">'''Dambo''' is a word used for a class of complex shallow [[wetlands]] in central, southern and eastern [[Africa]], particularly in [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. They are generally found in higher rainfall flat plateau areas, and have river-like branching forms which may be nowhere very large, but common enough to add up to a large area. For instance, dambos have been estimated to comprise 12.5% of the area of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;Chidumayo, E.N.: "The utilisation  status of dambos in southern Africa: a Zambian case study". In: Matiza, T. &amp; Chabwela, H.N. (eds.) ''Wetlands conservation conference for southern Africa'' (pp. 105-108). International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, Gland (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar African words include ''mbuga'' (commonly used in East Africa), ''matoro'' (Mashonaland), ''vlei'' (South Africa), ''fadama'' (Nigeria), and ''bolis'' (Sierra Leone); the French ''bas-fond'' and German ''Spültal'' have also been suggested as referring to similar grassy wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Goudie, "The Geomorphology of the Seasonal Tropics" in William M. Adams, ''et al.'' (editors), ''The Physical geography of Africa'' (Oxford: University Press, 1996), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of dambos==
'''Dambos''' are characterised by [[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Juncus|rushes]] and [[sedges]], contrasting with surrounding woodland such as  [[Miombo|Miombo woodland]]. They may be substantially dry at the end of the dry season, revealing grey soils or black clays, but unlike a [[flooded grassland]], they retain wet lines of drainage through the dry season. They are inundated (waterlogged) in the wet season but not generally above the height of the vegetation and any open water surface is usually confined to streams, rivers and small ponds or lagoons at the lowest point, generally near the centre.

The name dambo is most frequently used for wetlands on flat plateau which form the [[headwaters]] of streams and rivers. The definition for scientific purposes has been proposed as “seasonally waterlogged, predominantly grass covered, depressions bordering headwater drainage lines”.&lt;ref name="Mackel"&gt;Mackel, R. 1985. “Dambos and related landforms in Africa; an example for the ecological approach to tropical geomorphology”. Z. Geomorphol. N.F. Supplementband 52: 1–23. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of dambo==
The problem with the preceding definition is that the word may also be used for wetlands bordering rivers far from the headwaters, for example the dambo of the [[Mbereshi River]] where it enters the [[swamps]] of the [[Luapula River]] in Zambia, {{coord|09|43|30|S|28|46|00|E|}}. 

A 1998 report of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] distinguished between ‘hydromorphic/phreatic’ dambos (associated with headwaters) and ‘fluvial’ dambos (associated with rivers), and also referred to five geomorphological types in Zambia’s [[Luapula Province]]: ''upland'', ''valley'', ''hanging'', ''sand dune'' and ''pan'' dambos.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt; FAO: Wetland Characterization and Classification for Sustainable Agricultural Development 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrology of dambos==
Dambos are fed by rainfall which drains out slowly to feed streams and rivers, and are therefore a vital part of the [[water cycle]]. As well as being complex [[ecosystems]] in themselves they also play a role in the [[biodiversity]] of the region.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

There is a popular idea that dambos act like sponges to soak up the wet season rain which they release slowly into rivers during the dry season thus ensuring a year-round flow, but this is opposed by some research which suggests that in the middle to late dry season the water is actually released from [[aquifers]].&lt;ref name="Von der Heyden"&gt;Von der Heyden, C.J. and New, M.G.: “The role of the dambo in the hydrology of a catchment and the river network downstream”. Hydrology and Earth Science, 7(3). 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spring (hydrosphere)|Springs]] are seen in some dambos.

What this means in practice is that it may take a long time, perhaps several years, for water from a heavy rainy season to percolate through hills and emerge in a dambo, creating lagoons there or a flow in downstream rivers which can't be explained by the previous year's rainfall. Dambos may be involved, for instance, in explaining puzzling variations in water level or flow in [[Lake Mweru Wantipa]] and Lake Chila in [[Mbala, Zambia|Mbala]]. 

==Use of dambos==

'''Traditionally''', dambos have been exploited:
* as a dry-season water source
* for rushes used as [[thatching]] and fencing material
* for [[clay]] used for building, [[brick-making]] and [[earthenware]]
* for hunting (especially birds and small [[antelope]])
* for growing vegetables and other food crops, which can be vital in drought years since dambo soils usually retain enough moisture to produce a harvest when the rains fail 
* for soaking bitter [[cassava]] in dug ponds
* for [[fishing]] (generally using fish traps) in those dambos with streams and rivers

'''More recently''', they have been used for [[fish farming|fish ponds]] and growing upland [[rice]]. Efforts to develop dambos agriculturally have been hampered by a lack of research on the hydrology and soils of dambos, which have proved to be variable and complex.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; 

==Example==

A good example of a dambo can be seen at {{coord|11|28|S|28|54|E|}} (30 km south of [[Mansa, Zambia|Mansa]], Zambia) in a forest reserve. Unlike in the neighbouring areas which have been cleared for farming and charcoal-burning, the dambo contrasts well with the undisturbed Miombo woodland canopy. Note also that headwater dambos have a branching structure like rivers. Most of the dambos  have roughly the same width and form the same sort of pattern.

The '''Dhua Kund''' are a pair of waterfalls situated in the city of [[Sasaram]]. These two waterfalls have been utilised as a hydroelectricity source with the capacity to generate 50–100 MW of electricity.

==Festival==

Every year on Raksha Bandhan, a festival is organized on the premises of these waterfalls.

'''Diego Gutiérrez''' was a [[Spain|Spanish]] cosmographer and cartographer of the [[Casa de la Contratación]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=A Modern and Quite Precise Depiction of America (or the Fourth Part of the World)|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/32|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was given this post by royal appointment on October 22, 1554, after the death of his father Dylanger in January 1554, and worked on the [[Padrón Real]].

==New World map==
{{Main|Americae Sive Quartae Orbis Partis Nova Et Exactissima Descriptio}}
In 1562 Gutiérrez published a remarkable map entitled ''[[Americae Sive Quartae Orbis Partis Nova Et Exactissima Descriptio]]'' in [[Antwerp]] (then part of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]) in collaboration with the printer [[Hieronymus Cock]]. The reason it was published in Antwerp was because the Spanish engravers were not skilled enough to print such a complicated document.

Gutiérrez's map features not only the [[Amazon River]] system and [[Lake Titicaca]] as well as other geographical features, but also fanciful depictions of [[parrot]]s, [[monkey]]s, [[mermaid]]s, huge sea creatures, Brazilian [[cannibal]]s, [[Patagonian]] [[giant (mythology)|giants]], and an erupting [[volcano]] in central [[Mexico]].

It was the first map to print the [[toponym]] "[[California]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/1492/invent.html Inventing America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It also recorded the first appearance of a word for "[[Appalachia]]," as the term "Apalchen."

{{History of Austria}}
The '''Duchy of Styria''' ({{lang-de|Herzogtum Steiermark}}; {{lang-sl|Vojvodina Štajerska}}; {{lang-hu|Stájer Hercegség}}) was a duchy located in modern-day southern [[Austria]] and northern [[Slovenia]]. It was a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until its dissolution in 1806 and a [[Cisleithania]]n crown land of [[Austria–Hungary]] until its dissolution in 1918.

==History==
It was created by Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] in 1180 when he raised the [[March of Styria]] to a duchy of equal rank with neighbouring [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[History of Bavaria|Bavaria]], after the fall of the Bavarian duke [[Henry the Lion]] earlier that year. Margrave [[Ottokar IV, Duke of Styria|Ottokar IV]] thereby became the first Duke of Styria and also the last of the ancient [[Otakars|Otakar dynasty]]. As Ottokar had no issue, he in 1186 signed the [[Georgenberg Pact]] with the mighty [[House of Babenberg]], rulers of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] since 976, after which both duchies should in perpetuity be ruled in personal union. Upon his death in 1192, Styria as stipulated fell to the Babenberg duke [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]]. 
[[File:Grazer Schlossberg Kriegssteig.jpg|thumb|left|Grazer Schlossberg]]
The Austrian Babenbergs became extinct in 1246, when Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria|Frederick II the Quarrelsome]] was killed in battle against King [[Béla IV of Hungary]]. Styria, actually a ceased Imperial fief, due to the lack of a central authority after the deposition of Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] evolved into a matter of dispute among the neighbouring estates. It passed quickly through the hands of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1254, until the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II Přemysl]] conquered it, being victorious at the 1260 [[Battle of Kressenbrunn]]. As King Ottokar II had married the last duke's sister [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia|Margaret of Babenberg]] he laid claim to both Austria and Styria, which however met with strong opposition by the elected German king [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]], who now recalled the duchies as reverted fiefs. Rudolph finally defeated Ottokar at the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]], seized Austria and Styria and granted them to his sons [[Albert I of Germany|Albert I]] and [[Rudolf II, Duke of Austria|Rudolf II]].

The [[House of Habsburg]] provided Styria with dukes of their lineage ever since. It however was separated from Austria by the 1379 [[Treaty of Neuberg]], after which Styria, Carinthia and [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]] formed the [[Inner Austria]]n territory ruled by the descendants of [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria|Leopold III of Habsburg]] of the [[Leopoldian line]], who took their residence at [[Graz]]. In 1456 they could significantly enlarge the Styrian territory by acquisition and re-acquisition of the comital [[Counts of Celje|Celje]] estates in [[Lower Styria]]. Both duchies were again ruled in personal union, when Leopold's grandson [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick V]] inherited Austria in 1457. In 1496 Frederick's son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] signed an order expelling all [[Jew]]s from Styria, who were not allowed to return to Graz until 1856. In 1512 the duchy joined the Empire's [[Austrian Circle]].

A second Inner Austrian cadet branch of the Habsburgs ruled over Styria from 1564. Under Archduke [[Charles II of Austria|Charles II]] of Inner Austria, Graz became a centre of the [[Counter-Reformation]], expedited by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] at the [[University of Graz]] established in 1585 and continued under Charles' son Archduke [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II of Habsburg]], who became sole rule of all Habsburg hereditary lands and Holy Roman Emperor in 1619. The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] population was expelled, including the astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] in 1600. Meanwhile, at the time of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasions in the 16th and 17th centuries after the 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]], the land suffered severely and was depopulated. The Turks made incursions into Styria nearly twenty times; churches, monasteries, cities, and villages were destroyed and plundered, while the population was either killed or carried away into slavery.
[[File:Styrie en AT &amp; en SI.PNG|thumb|left|Duchy of Styria in modern Austria and Slovenia]]
Styria remained a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and from 1804 belonged to the [[Austrian Empire]]. The development of the duchy was decisively promoted by [[Archduke John of Austria]], younger brother of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I of Habsburg]], who in 1811 founded the ''[[Landesmuseum Joanneum|Joanneum]]'', predecessor of the [[Graz University of Technology]], and the [[University of Leoben]] in 1840. He also forwarded the construction of the [[Semmering railway]] to [[Mürzzuschlag]] and the [[Austrian Southern Railway]] line from [[Vienna]] to [[Trieste]] completed in 1857, which boosted the Styrian economy. In the course of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] (''Ausgleich''), the duchy was assigned as a crown land for the [[Cisleithania]]n part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], while along with the rise of [[nationalism]] the conflict between the [[Germans|German]] and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] population intensified.

On the collapse of Austria-Hungary in the aftermath of [[World War I]], the [[rump state]] of [[German Austria]] claimed all [[Cisleithania]]n Austria with a significant German-speaking population including large parts of the Styrian duchy, while the Slovene [[Lower Styria]]n part joined the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. Armed conflicts arose especially around the multilingual town of [[Maribor]] (Marburg), until by the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St Germain]] the former duchy was partitioned broadly along [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic]] lines, with two thirds of its territory (then called [[Upper Styria]]) including the ducal capital of Graz remaining with [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], and the southern third of [[Lower Styria]] with [[Maribor]] passing to the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], eventually becoming part of modern [[Slovenia]].

"'''East Indiaman'''" was a general name for any sailing ship operating under charter or licence to any of the [[East India Company (disambiguation)|East India Companies]] of the major European trading powers of the 17th through the 19th centuries. The term is therefore used to refer to vessels belonging to the [[Danish East India Company|Danish]], [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] (''Oostindiëvaarder''), [[English East India Company|English]], [[French East India Company|French]], [[Portuguese East India Company|Portuguese]], or [[Swedish East India Company|Swedish]] (''ostindiefarare'') East India companies.
 
Some of the East Indiamen chartered by the British East India Company were known as [[Clipper|"tea clippers"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Villiers|first1=Allan|title=The Cutty Sark|date=1 Jan 1966|publisher=Hodder|location=UK|isbn=|url=https://www.amazon.com/CUTTY-SARK-ALAN-VILLIERS/dp/B00101ZD2I/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401776319&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=cutty+sark+book|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the [[Honourable East India Company]] held a monopoly granted to it by Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1600 for all English trade between the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Cape Horn]], which was progressively restricted during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, until the monopoly was lost in 1834. English (later British) East Indiamen usually ran between England, the Cape of Good Hope and India, where their primary destinations were the ports of [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[Chennai|Madras]] and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. The Indiamen often continued on to China before returning to England via the Cape of Good Hope and [[Saint Helena]]. When the company lost its monopoly, the ships of this design were sold off. A smaller, faster ship known as a [[Blackwall Frigate]] was built for the trade as the need to carry heavy armaments declined.

==Description of the sailing vessels and the trade==
[[Image:VOC ship Amsterdam2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A full-scale replica of the Dutch Indiaman [[Amsterdam (VOC ship)|''Amsterdam]]'']]
"East Indiaman" was a general name for any sailing ship operating under charter or licence to any of the [[East India Company (disambiguation)|East India Companies]] of the major European trading powers of the 17th through the 19th centuries. These include the Danish, Dutch, English, French, Portuguese and Swedish East India companies.

East Indiamen carried both passengers and goods, and were armed to defend themselves against pirates. Initially, the East Indiamen were built to carry as much cargo as possible, rather than for speed of sailing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Tea Clippers |url=http://www.tea.co.uk/tea-clippers |publisher=U.K. Tea and Infusions Association |accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British East India Company|East India company]] had a monopoly on trade with [[British Indian Empire|India]] and [[China]], supporting this design.

East Indiamen were the largest merchant ships regularly built during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, generally measuring between 1100 and 1400 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen (bm)]]. Two of the largest were the ''[[Earl of Mansfield (ship)|Earl of Mansfield]]'' and ''[[HMS Madras (1795)|Lascelles]]'' being built at [[Deptford]] in 1795. The [[Royal Navy]] purchased both, converted them to 56-gun [[fourth rate]]s, and renamed them ''[[HMS Weymouth (1795)|Weymouth]]'' and ''[[HMS Madras|Madras]]'' respectively.  They measured 1426 tons (bm) on dimensions of approximately 175 feet overall length of hull, 144 feet keel, 43 feet beam, 17 feet draft.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In England, Queen Elizabeth I granted an exclusive right to the trade to [[East India Company#Establishments in Britain|one company]] in 1600. This monopoly lasted until 1834. The company grew to encompass more than the trade between England and India, but the ships described in this article are the type used in the 17th to the early 19th centuries to carry the trade.

==During the wars with France==
During the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] they were often painted to resemble warships; an attacker could not be sure if gunports were real or merely paint, and some Indiamen carried sizable armaments. The [[Royal Navy]] acquired several East Indiamen, turning them into [[fourth rate]]s (e.g., HMS ''Weymouth'' and HMS ''Madras'', described above), maintaining the confusion for military ships seeking merchant ships as prizes of war. In some cases the East Indiamen successfully fought off attacks by the French. One of the most celebrated of these incidents occurred in 1804, when a fleet of East Indiamen and other merchant vessels under [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Nathaniel Dance]] successfully fought off a marauding squadron commanded by Admiral [[Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois|Linois]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] in the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]].

Due to the need to carry heavy cannon, the hull of the East Indiamen – in common with most warships of the time – was much wider at the waterline than at the upper deck, so that guns carried on the upper deck were closer to the centre-line to aid stability. This is known as [[tumblehome]]. The ships normally had two complete decks for accommodation within the hull and a raised [[poop deck]]. The poop deck and the deck below it were lit with square-windowed galleries at the stern. To support the weight of the galleries, the hull lines towards the stern were full. Later ships built without this feature tended to sail faster,{{when|date=August 2015}} which put the East Indiamen at a commercial disadvantage once the need for heavy armament passed.

==Ships for the India-China trade==

[[Image:East Indiamen in a Gale.jpg|200px|left|East Indiamen in a Gale, by [[Charles Brooking]], c. 1759|thumb]]
[[File:Wreck of the Grosvenor02.jpg|thumb|East Indiaman ''Grosvenor'' by [[George Carter (artist)|George Carter]]]]
According to historian [[Fernand Braudel]], some of the finest and largest Indiamen of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were built in India, making use of Indian shipbuilding techniques and crewed by Indians, their hulls of Indian [[teak]] being especially suitable for local waters. These ships were used for the China run. Until the coming of steamships, these Indian-built ships were relied upon almost exclusively by the British in the eastern seas. None sailed to Europe and they were banned from English ports.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Many hundreds of Indian-built Indiamen were built for the British, along with other ships, including warships. Notable among them were ''Surat Castle'' (1791), a 1,000-ton (bm) ship with a crew of 150, ''Lowjee Family'', of 800 tons (bm) and a crew of 125, and ''Shampinder'' (1802), of 1,300 tons (bm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Braudel |first=Fernand |title=The Perspective of the World: Civilization &amp; Capitalism, 15th–18th Century |volume=3 |year=1979 |publisher= Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-06-015317-2 |page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable ships==
[[File:Ostindiefararen-Götheborg-avsegling-oktober-2005.jpg|thumb|The full-scale sailing replica of the Swedish East Indiaman ''[[Götheborg (ship)|Götheborg]]'' in 2005]]
Another significant East Indiaman in this period was the 1176-ton (bm) ''Warley'' that John Perry built at his [[Blackwall Yard]] in 1788, and which the [[Royal Navy]] bought in 1795 and renamed {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}. In 1803 she was employed as a transport to establish a settlement at [[Port Phillip]] in Australia, later shifted to the site of current-day [[Hobart, Tasmania]] by an accompanying ship, the ''Ocean''. French forces captured ''Calcutta'' in 1805 off the [[Isles of Scilly]]. She grounded at the [[Battle of the Basque Roads]] in 1809, and was burned by a British boarding party after her French crew had abandoned her.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The 1200-ton (bm) [[Arniston (ship)|''Arniston'']] was likewise employed by the Royal Navy as a troop transport between England and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. In 1815, she was wrecked near [[Cape Agulhas]] with the loss of 372 lives after a navigation error that was caused by inaccurate [[dead reckoning]] and the lack of a [[marine chronometer]] with which to calculate her [[longitude]].

==End of the era of East Indiamen sailing ships==
[[Image:East Indiamen Madagascar.JPG|thumb|260px|right|East Indiamen off Madagascar, circa 1837]]
With the progressive restriction of the monopoly of the [[British East India Company]] the desire to build such large armed ships for commercial use waned, and during the late 1830s a smaller, faster ship known as a [[Blackwall Frigate]] was built for the premium end of the India and China trades. The last of the East Indiamen was reputed to be the [[Java (ship)|Java 1813–1939]] that became a coal hulk, then was broken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gibraltar-intro.blogspot.com/2015/01/1811-java-triumph-of-skill-w.html|title=The People of Gibraltar |access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
The [[Battle of Pulo Aura]] is featured in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel [[HMS Surprise (novel)|''HMS Surprise'']], with French Admiral Linois in pursuit of a large fleet of East Indiamen. In the novel, HMS ''Surprise'' under Captain Aubrey organizes the merchantmen to defeat Linois and his squadron. In history, all the ships that defeated the French squadron were merchantmen.

In the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]], East Indiamen are involved in many of the novels, including the second set in the Peace of Amiens, where some of the sailors took positions on East Indiamen. In other of the novels, Aubrey intercepts enemy vessels that interfere with the merchant ships, earning their gratitude.

'''Edward William Brayley''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (1801 – 1 February 1870) was an English [[geographer]], librarian, and science author.

==Early life==
Brayley was born in London, the son of [[Edward Wedlake Brayley]], a notable [[antiquary]], and his wife Anne (''c.'' 1771–1850). His early schooling, in the company of his brothers Henry and Horatio was private and sheltered. His upbringing was austere with little contact with other children or the world outside his home. He later studied at the [[London Institution]] and the [[Royal Institution]] under [[William Thomas Brande]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Hays (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Brayley abandoned an early inclination to follow his father's interests&lt;ref&gt;Brayley (1825)&lt;/ref&gt; for science. He published on diverse topics in several [[scientific journal]]s including the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', for which he became an editorial assistant between 1823 and 1844. In 1829 and 1830, Brayley was employed by [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Rowland Hill]] to lecture on the [[physical science]]s at his schools as Hazelwood, [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham and [[Bruce Castle School|Bruce Castle]], [[Tottenham]], London.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Librarian and lecturer==
In 1834, he became librarian of the London Institution and in 1865 professor of [[physical geography]]. He lectured there on diverse subjects and also at the [[Royal Institution]], the [[Birkbeck, University of London|London Mechanics' Institute]], and the [[Belgrave Institution|Belgrave]], [[Russell Institution|Russell]], and [[Marylebone Institution]]s. As a staff member of the London Institution he was often called on at the last minute to substitute for an indisposed lecturer and his talks included:&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

{{col-end}}

==Editor==
Most of his scientific work involved the analysis and synthesis of the published ideas of others. Brayley worked on the publication of [[Samuel Parkes (chemist)|Samuel Parkes]]'s ''Chemical Catechism'' (1834) and contributed many biographical and scientific articles to the ''[[English Cyclopaedia]]''. Brayley was a close collaborator and friend of [[William Robert Grove]] and notably worked with him on the publication of Groves's seminal book on the [[conservation of energy]], ''On the Correlation of Physical Forces'' (1846). He also assisted in the editing of [[Luke Howard]]'s ''Barometrographia'' (1847).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Personality and death==
Though he is known to have married, nothing is known of his wife. Brayley died of [[heart disease]] at his home in [[Islington]], London.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

[[File:Yllästunturi Ylläsjärven puolelta.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Ylläs]] fell in [[Kolari]], [[Finnish Lapland]]]]
[[File:Børvasstindene.jpg|thumb|350px|Børvasstindene in Norway, near [[Bodø]]]]

A '''fell''' (from [[Old Norse]] ''fell'', ''fjall'', "mountain"&lt;ref name=FALKTORP161&gt;Falk and Torp (2006:161).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain range or [[Moorland|moor]]-covered hills. The term is most often employed in [[Fennoscandia]], the [[Isle of Man]], parts of [[Northern England]], and [[Scotland]].

== Etymology ==
The English word ''fell'' comes from [[Old Norse]] ''fell'' and ''fjall'' (both forms existed).&lt;ref name=FALKTORP161/&gt; It is cognate with [[Danish language|Danish]] ''fjeld'', [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''fjall'' and ''fjøll'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''fjall'' and ''fell'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''fjell'' with [[Norwegian dialects|dialects]] ''fjøll'', ''fjødd'', ''fjedd'', ''fjedl'', ''fjill'', ''fil(l)'' and ''fel'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norskstadnamnleksikon.no/grunnord.aspx Norsk Stadnamn Leksikon: Grunnord]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''fjäll'', all referring to mountains rising above the [[Tree line|alpine tree line]].&lt;ref name=ARVEORD270-271&gt;Bjorvand and Lindeman (2007:270–271).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scafell massif enclosures.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Scafell]] massif from Yewbarrow, Wasdale, Cumbria. In the valley are older enclosures and higher up on the fell-side are the parliamentary enclosures following straight lines regardless of terrain.]]

In [[Northern England]], especially in the [[Lake District]] and in the [[Pennines|Pennine]] [[Dale (origin)|Dale]]s, the word "fell" originally referred to an area of uncultivated high ground used as common [[grazing]] usually on [[common land]] and above the timberline. Today, generally, "fell" refers to the [[mountain]]s and [[hill]]s of the Lake District and the Pennine Dales.

Names that originally referred to grazing areas have been applied to these hilltops. This is the case with [[Seathwaite Fell]], for example, which would be the common grazing land used by the farmers of [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite]]. The fellgate marks the road from a settlement onto the fell (see photograph for example), as is the case with the Seathwaite Fell. In other cases the reverse is true; for instance, the name of [[Wetherlam]], in the [[Coniston Fells]], though understood to refer to the mountain as a whole, strictly speaking refers to the summit; the slopes have names such as Tilberthwaite High Fell, Low Fell and Above Beck Fells.
[[File:Fellgate.jpg|thumb|Fell Lane, near [[Ingleton, North Yorkshire|Ingleton]] towards the fellgate and [[Ingleborough]], North Yorkshire, England]]

The word "fell" is also used in the names of various breeds of [[livestock]], bred for life on the uplands, such as [[Rough Fell (sheep)|Rough Fell]] sheep, [[Fell Terrier]]s and [[fell pony|Fell ponies]].

It is also found in many place names across the North of England, often attached to the name of a community; thus the township of [[Cartmel Fell]].

In northern England, there is a [[Lord of the Fells]] – this ancient aristocratic title being associated with the [[Lords of Bowland]].

Groups of [[cairn]]s are a common feature on many fells, often marking the summit – there are fine examples on [[Wild Boar Fell]] in [[Mallerstang]] Dale, [[Cumbria]], and on [[Nine Standards Rigg]] just outside [[Kirkby Stephen]], Cumbria.

As the most mountainous region of England, the Lake District is the area most closely associated with the sport of [[fell running]], which takes its name from the fells of the district. "Fellwalking" is also the term used locally for the activity known in the rest of [[Great Britain]] as [[hillwalking]].

The word "fell" also enjoys limited use in Scotland, with for example the Campsie Fells in Central Scotland, to the North East of Glasgow. One of the most famous examples of the use of the word "fell" in Scotland is [[Goat Fell]], the highest point on the [[Isle of Arran]]. [[Criffel]] and the nearby Long Fell in Galloway may be seen from the northern Lake District of England. [[Peel Fell]] in the Kielder Forest is situated on the border between the Scottish Borders to the North and the English county of Northumberland to the South.

== Fennoscandia ==
{{see also|Scandinavian Mountains}}
In Norway, ''fjell'', in common usage, is generally interpreted as simply a summit of greater altitude than a hill, which leads to a great deal of local variation in what is defined as a 'fjell'. Professor of geography at the University of Bergen, Anders Lundeberg, has summed up the problem by stating that "There simply is no fixed and unambiguous definition of 'fjell'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/--Floyen-er-ikke-et-fjell-1884352.html  |title=- Fløyen er ikke et fjell |last=Tufto |first=Jon |work=bt.no |accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivar Aasen]] defined ''fjell'' as a "tall [[wikt:berg|berg]]", primarily referring to a ''berg'' that reaches an altitude where trees don't grow, lower ''berg'' are referred to as "berg", "ås" (hill, ridge) or "hei" (moor, heathland). The fixed expression ''til fjells'' refers to mountains (or uplands) as a collective rather than a specific location or specific summit. According to Ivar Aasen ''berg'' refers to cliffs, bedrock and notable elevations of the surface underpinned by bedrock; ''berg'' also refers to the substance of bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;Aasen, Ivar (1918): ''Norsk ordbog med dansk forklaring.'' Vestmannalaget/Cammermeyer.&lt;/ref&gt; For all practical purposes, 'fjell' can be translated as 'mountain' and the Norwegian language has no other commonly used word for mountain. 

In Sweden, "fjäll" refers to any mountain or upland high enough that forest will not naturally survive at the top, in effect a mountain [[tundra]]. 'Fjäll' is primarily used to describe mountains in the Nordic countries, but also more generally to describe mountains shaped by massive ice sheets, primarily in Arctic and subarctic regions.

In Finnish, the mountains characteristic of the region of [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]] are called ''tunturi'' (plural: ''tunturit''). In Finnish, the geographical term ''vuori'' is used for mountains recently uplifted and with jagged terrain featuring permanent glaciers, while ''tunturi'' refers to the old, highly eroded, gently shaped terrain without glaciers, as found in Finland. (Also, ''tunturi'' is used to refer to treeless plains at high altitudes in far north regions, as well.) They are round [[Monadnock|inselbergs]] rising from the otherwise flat surroundings. The mountains in Finnish Lapland reach heights of up to 400 and 800 metres, where the upper reaches are above the tree line. Those that do not reach the tree line, on the other hand, are mostly referred to as ''vaara''. The mountains in Finnish Lapland form vestiges of the [[Karelides]] mountains, formed two billion years ago. The term ''tunturi'', originally a word limited to Far-Northern dialects of Finnish and Karelian, is a [[Loanword|loan]] from [[Sami languages|Sami]], compare [[Proto-Sami language|Proto-Sami]] ''*tuontër'', [[Southern Sami language|South Sami]] ''doedtere'', [[Northern Sami]] ''duottar'', [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] ''tuodâr'' "uplands, mountains, tundra", [[Kildin Sami]] ''tūndâr'', which means "uplands, treeless mountain tract" and is cognate with Finnish ''tanner'' "hard ground".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aikio|first1=Ante|title=The Saami Loanwords in Finnish and Karelian|date=2009|publisher=unpublished dissertation|location=Oulu|pages=283|url=https://www.academia.edu/4813912/The_Saami_Loanwords_in_Finnish_and_Karelian|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this Sami word, the word ''[[tundra]]'' is borrowed, as well, through the [[Russian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kotus.fi/julkaisut/ikkunat/1999/kielii1999_19.shtml  |title=Tunturista jängälle |last=Aapala |first=Kirsti |work=Kieli-ikkunat |accessdate=2009-11-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061001211854/http://www.kotus.fi/julkaisut/ikkunat/1999/kielii1999_19.shtml |archivedate = 2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Itkonen |first=Erkki |year=1945 |title=Tanner, tunturi, tundra (Zusammenfassung: Finn. tanner 'Feld', tunturi 'Fjell, hochgelegene Bergfläche (im hohen Norden)' und tundra 'Tundra') |journal=Virittäjä |pages=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Förfjäll===
{{see also|Precordillera|Norrland terrain}}
The term förfjäll (literally "fore-fell") is used in Sweden and Finland&lt;ref name=Natenterrang&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/finland?i_h_word=%25C3%25B6sterland |title=Finland: Terrängformer och berggrund |last=Behrens |first=Sven |last2=Lundqvist|first2=Thomas|author-link2=Thomas Lundqvist (geologist) |date= |website=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] |publisher=Cydonia Development |access-date=November 30, 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote mountainous zones lower and less dissected than the fell proper. On the other hand, its more pronounced relief, its often higher amount of plateaux and its coherent valley systems distinguishes the förfjäll also from the undulating hilly terrain (bergkullsterräng) and the plains with residual hills (bergkullslätt). Generally the förfjäll do not surpass 1000 m.a.s.l. As a geomorphic unit the förfjäll extends across Sweden as a 650 km long and 40 to 80 km broad belt from [[Dalarna]] in the south to [[Norrbotten]] in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1984 |title=Terrängformer i Norden |url= |location= |editor= |publisher=Nordiska ministerrådet|language=Swedish |page=10 |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9515">As the [[Viceroy|viceregal]] representative of the [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]], the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governors of the Canadian provinces]] have since Confederation been entitled to and have used a personal standard. Within a lieutenant governor's province, this standard has precedence over any other flag, including the [[flag of Canada|national one]], though it comes secondary to the [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|Queen's Canadian Royal Standard]]. The provincial viceregal flags are also subordinate to the [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|governor general's personal standard]], save for when the governor general is present as a guest of the lieutenant governor.

In 1980, a new common design was introduced and is used by each province's lieutenant governor, except for Quebec and Nova Scotia. Each flag consists of the escutcheon of the arms of the province circled with ten gold maple leaves (representing the ten provinces) surmounted by a [[St Edward's Crown|St. Edward's Crown]] on a field of blue. Though approved in 1980, most provinces adopted this new common design in 1981, with Newfoundland being the last in 1987. The personal standard is flown at the office or home of the lieutenant governor and from flagpoles of buildings where official duties are carried out to indicate presence of the lieutenant governor. It is also attached to the front fender of the car or on the provincial [[wikt:landau|landau]] that the lieutenant governor is riding in. The standard is never flown on a church or inside a church, nor is it ever lowered to half-mast. Should a lieutenant governor die while in office, the standard is taken down until a successor is sworn in.

'''''Funky Bones''''' is a public artwork by [[Atelier Van Lieshout]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist collective led by [[Joep van Lieshout]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], which is on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].  The artwork, primarily made from [[fiberglass]], consists of twenty white and black [[bone]]-shaped benches.

==Description==
''Funky Bones'' is situated in the Meadow region just south of the lake at 100 Acres.  It is a site-specific artwork consisting of twenty white bone-shaped benches inscribed with black drawings of bones that together form a large stylized human [[skeleton]]. The artwork was constructed primarily from fiberglass, [[plywood]], and [[concrete]]. Each bench is a fiberglass shell filled with a lightweight foam material. The fiberglass surface has been impregnated with pigment, carved, and coated in polyester resin. Plywood was used only during the detailing process of the black bone segments and is not visible in the completed artwork. The concrete component for this artwork is not visible but rather serves as a structural aid, anchoring and securing the individual benches into the ground. A standard [[ready-mix concrete]] was used for this application.

The skeleton is positioned with its arms spread out horizontally while the legs point straight down.  The individual benches range in both length and width, but all are approximately 26'' in height.  The artwork was fabricated in Atelier Van Lieshout's studio in [[Rotterdam]] and shipped to the Indianapolis Museum of Art where it was installed by the design and installation crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/100acres/artists/ateliervanlieshout|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
''Funky Bones'' was installed at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in May 2010 and is currently on temporary loan.&lt;ref name="Sheets"/&gt; The artwork arose from many disparate interests of Joep van Lieshout, the founder and head designer of AVL. These include [[human anatomy]] &lt;ref name="Schengen"&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Acres Sculpture Park in Indianapolis|publisher=Schengen Visas Organization|url=http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331185139/http://www.schengenvisas.org/2011/07/100-acres-sculpture-park-in-indianapolis/|archivedate=2012-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of the site. Concerning the original concept and inspiration behind ''Funky Bones'', Joep van Lieshout stated:

{{quote|I came up with [this] design that is not only a site specific artwork referring to the history of the continent, but also provides a function and will improve the stay of the park's visitors.  Even as a child I knew the state Indiana and Indianapolis as an exotic place where the 'Indians' came from and were living, and even though this is not true, it is important for my proposition.  Another field of interest is the history of art and especially in early developments of art from primitive and native cultures.  In early art forms, techniques and skills were not so developed and the artworks were made in a very basic way, therefore art had a direct relation to the people, its time and environment.  Native American art, design, and architecture produced beautiful artifacts, religion, and lifestyle, but after the appearance of the 'more advanced' culture from the east the original inhabitants were moved around and dispersed.  The very few things that remained are their cultural heritage and artifacts scattered around.  At this time of rapid production and consumption, their primitive lifestyle, close to nature, seems to become a necessary utopia.  The dislocated Funky Bone benches installed in the park stand symbolic for the leftovers of their sold culture and the spread of Native Americans over the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Nicole|author2=Richard McCoy|title=The Outdoor Sculptures of 100 Acres: A Report for the Objects and Variable Art Laboratory at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|journal=Indianapolis Museum of Art|year=2011|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to resonating with the location's history, ''Funky Bones'' also has the functional purpose of providing an ideal spot for visitors to sit, [[picnic]], lounge, or climb.&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joep van Lieshout observed visitors sitting on rocks during visits to the site, and decided to provide them with more comfortable seating arrangements in order to facilitate interaction, both among viewers as well as between viewer and art.&lt;ref name="fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Funky Bones, Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|url=http://www.resnicowschroeder.com/rsa/upload/PM/493_Filename_Art%20Nature%20Park%20Fact%20Sheet_Atelier%20Van%20Leishout.pdf|accessdate=25 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This degree of interactivity, and even fun, makes ''Funky Bones'' extremely child-friendly.&lt;ref name="Wiltrout"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiltrout|first=Nicole|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art's 100 Acres|publisher=Indiana Insider|date=19 Jul 2011|url=http://www.in.gov/visitindiana/blog/index.php/2011/07/19/indianapolis-museum-of-arts-100-acres/|accessdate=5 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Atelier Van Lieshout (AVL) is a multidisciplinary company that operates internationally in the field of contemporary art, design, and architecture.  Joep van Lieshout (born 1963), founder of AVL, is a Dutch artist born in Ravenstein, The Netherlands.  He received his formal education and training from the Academy of Modern Art in Rotterdam (1980–1985), [[Ateliers '63]] in Haarlem (1985-1987), and from the [[Villa Arson]] in Nice, France (1987).  Joep van Lieshout formed the AVL studio group in 1995 in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where the company continues to design and fabricate their widely exhibited works.  Atelier Van Lieshout has attained international recognition for objects-based projects that balance on the boundary between art, architecture and design.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  Recurring themes in the work of AVL include self-sufficiency, power, politics, and the more classical themes of life and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout webpage|publisher=Atelier Van Lieshout|url=http://www.ateliervanlieshout.com/|accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Atelier Van Lieshout emphasizes the fact that, although Joep van Lieshout founded and leads the collective, the work produced stems from the creative impulses of the entire team.&lt;ref name="Benda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atelier Van Lieshout|publisher=Friedman Benda|url=http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|accessdate=28 Aug 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127053738/http://www.friedmanbenda.com/artists/atelier-van-lieshout/bio/|archivedate=2011-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Funky Bones,'' AVL's most relevant recurring themes are domestication, politics, complex functioning systems, and the re-contextualization of familiar, domestic objects.  The Atelier van Lieshout claims to make no distinction between "real artworks" and "just building something for someone."&lt;ref name="Dellinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dellinger|first=Jade|author2=Hester Schaaf|title=FAQ's about the Atelier Van Lieshout|journal=REVEALED!!! STAFF TELLS ALL ...|year=1998|pages=31|publisher=Nicoline Gatehouse|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The studio group focuses on creating artworks whose design principles challenge conventional ideas of utility and functionality by reinventing how the viewer perceives or approaches an object and the environment in which it is placed.  This is achieved by the implementation of  non-traditional materials and color palettes, odd or unusual subject matter, and through the strategic positioning or locale of the artwork.&lt;ref name="Dellinger"/&gt; ''Funky Bones'' is impossible to see in its entirety except at a distance, preferably from above. Moving close enough to actually interact with it produces an entirely different perspective.&lt;ref name="Schengen"/&gt;

==Condition==
In general, the bones require regular cleaning in order to maintain their white color. Instrumental analysis involving the artwork's color and gloss levels has been recorded for future reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Nicole|title=Art, Color, and Gloss|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/blog/2011/07/13/art-color-and-gloss/|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the book ''[[The Fault in Our Stars]]'', by Indianapolis-based author [[John Green (author)|John Green]], the sculpture is the location of a romantic picnic, having been picked by one of the characters as being the most Dutch place in Indianapolis. ''Funky Bones'' was recreated in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] for the film adaptation of ''The Fault in Our Stars''. The recreation was built by set designers, with help from the artist and Sarah Urist Green, wife of John Green, and former Curator of Contemporary Art at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=John|title=Question Tuesday: The Fault in Our Stars Movie Edition|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_731GRjCCI|work=vlogbrothers YouTube Channel|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geographic center of the United States''' is a point approximately {{convert|20|miles|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} north of [[Belle Fourche, South Dakota]] (Lat. 44 58 02.07622(N) Long. 103 46 17.60283(W)).  It has been regarded as such by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] (NGS) since the additions of [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] to the [[United States]] in 1959.

==Overview==
This is distinct from the [[Geographic center of the contiguous United States|contiguous geographic center]], which has not changed [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|since the 1912 admissions]] of [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] to the [[contiguous United States]], and falls near the town of [[Lebanon, Kansas]]. This served as the overall geographic center of the United States for 47 years, until the 1959 admissions of Alaska and Hawaii moved the geographic center of the overall United States approximately {{convert|550|miles|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} [[Boxing the compass|northwest by north]].

While any measurement of the exact center of a land mass will always be imprecise due to changing shorelines and other factors, the NGS coordinates identify the spot as an uninhabited parcel of private pastureland approximately {{convert|12|miles|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} east of the cornerpoint where the South Dakota/[[Wyoming]]/[[Montana]] borders meet. According to the NGS data sheet, the actual marker is "set in an irregular mass of concrete 36 inches below the surface of the ground."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=PU2386  designates the "Center" as 44 58 02.07622(N)    103 46 17.60283(W)&lt;/ref&gt;

For public commemoration, a nearby proxy marker is located in a park in Belle Fourche,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=4867&lt;/ref&gt; where one will find a flag atop a small concrete slab bearing a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Reference Marker.

The '''geographical center of [[Sweden]]''' is contested amongst at least two locations. 

The oldest and most famous geographical center of Sweden is '''Flataklocken''', a spot next to Lake Munkby in [[Torpshammar]], [[Medelpad]] at {{coord|62|23|15|N|16|19|32|E|region:SE_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}. The site was identified in 1947 after an initiative by the newspaperman [[Gustaf von Platen]]. The method used for calculating this point was that of the centre of gravity of the geometrical figure of Sweden. The calculation was made by professor Nils Friberg and Tor Andeldorf at the geography department of [[Stockholm University]], using a cardboard cutout map of Sweden with outlying islands attached directly to the mainland. They balanced the map model on a needle and declared the balancing point the geographical center. 

A delegation including Gustaf von Platen, [[explorer]] Hans Ostelius and [[Orienteering|orienteer]] Gösta Lagerfelt trekked through the wilderness to the site and declared it the geographical center. Later, a sign marking the significance of the spot was erected and a lookout built. The site has since become a popular [[tourist attraction]]. 

Area towns [[Ånge]] and [[Östersund]] often claim to be the geographical center of Sweden.

Other places have been claimed to be the centre of Sweden, using differing methods. The most prominent is [[Ytterhogdal]] in [[Hälsingland]], based on the methodology of calculating the latitude for the point halfway between the northernmost ([[Treriksröset]]) and southernmost (southern tip of [[Skåne]]) points, and then taking the mid between the easternmost and westernmost points at that latitude.

[[Andorra]] is a small, landlocked country in southwestern Europe, located in the eastern [[Pyrenees]] mountain range and bordered by Spain and France. With an area of 468&amp;nbsp;km², it is the sixth smallest country in Europe and also the largest of the [[European microstates]].

Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains, the highest being the [[Coma Pedrosa]] at {{convert|2942|m|ft|0}}, and the average elevation of Andorra is {{convert|1996|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas of Andorra (1991), Andorran Government. {{oclc|801960401}}.  {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the [[Gran Valira]] river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra's lowest point of {{convert|840|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

Andorra's [[climate]] is similar to that of its neighbours' [[temperate climate]]s, but its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer. There are, on average, 300&amp;nbsp;days per year of sunshine.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the ecoregion of [[Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests]].

Landslides and avalanches are the main natural hazards. There are frequent earthquakes below [[Richter magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;2. There is no historical record of any damaging earthquakes in Andorra, but the Andorran government has studied the possibility of a future one.&lt;ref name="sost1"&gt;[http://www.sostenibilitat.ad/admin/documents/23102008152321_programa%20activitats%20TARDOR%2008.pdf Conseqüències per a Andorra d'un possible terratrèmol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706062233/http://www.sostenibilitat.ad/admin/documents/23102008152321_programa%20activitats%20TARDOR%2008.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Programa dactivitats tardor 08, ''el Centre Andorra Sostenible'', Govern d'Andorra, p.16. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mountains==
[[File:Andorra la Vella view2.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Andorra la Vella]] with mountains]]
All of Andorra is mountainous, and in total, there are 65 mountain peaks.&lt;ref name="dss"&gt;Andorra – The Principality in Figures (2007), p.16, ''Andorra Turisme / Department of Studies and Statistics''&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest mountain is [[Coma Pedrosa]], which rises to {{convert|2942|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the northwest of Andorra near the French and Spanish borders.

Along the border with France, from west to east, the highest mountains are [[Pic de Médécourbe]] ({{convert|2914|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), which is the western tripoint international boundary of Andorra, France, and Spain, [[Pic de Cataperdis]] ({{convert|2805|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Pic de Tristaina]] ({{convert|2878|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Pic de Font Blanca]] ({{convert|2903|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the northwest; [[Pic de Siguer]] ({{convert|2903|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Pic de la Serrera]] ({{convert|2914|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Pic d'Anrodat]] ({{convert|2730|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the north; and [[Pic de Noé]] ({{convert|2737|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Pic de la Cabaneta]] ({{convert|2818|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Roc Mélé]] ({{convert|2811|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the east.

Along the border with Spain, from west to east, the highest mountains are [[Pic de Médécourbe]] ({{convert|2914|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Pic de Coma Pedrosa ({{convert|2942|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Port de Cabús]] ({{convert|2301|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Pic dels Llacs]] ({{convert|2692|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the west; [[Pic Negre]] ({{convert|2665|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Torre dels Soldats]] ({{convert|2761|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and [[Pic de la Portelleta]] ({{convert|2905|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the south.

In the east, near where the borders of the two countries meet, lies [[Pic d’Envalira]] ({{convert|2825|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Pic dels Pessons]] ({{convert|2865|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}). A lake, [[Estany de l'Estanyó]], and a mountain, [[Pic de l’Estanyó]] ({{convert|2915|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) lie just east of [[El Serrat]] and are accessible only by hiking trail.

==Lakes and rivers==
Andorra is drained almost entirely by a single basin whose main river, the [[Gran Valira]], exits the country in the south near the Spain–Andorra road border crossing. There are two main tributaries and six smaller open basins. These basins gave the name by which the region was traditionally known, The Valleys ([[Les Valls]]).

The [[Valira del Nord]] is the northwest tributary, flowing from near El Serrat through the settlements of Les Salines, Arans, La Cortinada, Sornàs, [[Ordino]], and [[La Massana]] — where it meets the [[Riu Tristaina|Tristaina River]] — and eventually through [[Les Escaldes]] where it meets the [[Valira d'Orient]] forming the Gran Valira.

The [[Valira d'Orient]] is the northeast tributary, flowing from near [[Grau Roig]] through [[Soldeu]], [[Canillo]], [[Encamp]], and Les Escaldes where it meets the [[Riu Madriu|Madriu River]] and then the Valira del Nord, becoming the Gran Valira.

There are also several much smaller drainage basins that span Andorra's borders with France and Spain. The most notable of these is the Pic de Maià basin whose main river, the Sant Josep, flows easterly out of the country into France and is a tributary of the [[Ariège River]].

Andorra has 172 lakes, of which the largest is Estanys de Juclar ({{convert|23|ha|acre|1|disp=or}})&lt;ref name="gg1"/&gt; near Pic de Noé in the north east.

==Climate==
The climate in Andorra varies greatly with elevation. The valleys have a climate that is similar to the [[temperate]] climate of Andorra's neighbours, but because of the higher elevation, winters tend to be more severe, the humidity lower, and summers slightly cooler. Regions above the [[tree line#Alpine tree lines|Alpine tree line]] at about {{convert|2100|–|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} have an [[alpine climate]] and [[alpine tundra]]. Snow completely covers the northern valleys for several months. There are, on average, 300 days per year of sunshine. Average daily peak [[insolation]] varies from 1150&amp;nbsp;[[Watt|W]]/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in June to 280&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in December.&lt;ref name="wu1"&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=42.511%2C1.543 Andorra – Escaldes,''Weather Underground'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catmet"&gt;Atles climàtic de Catalunya. Periode 1961–1990. Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya, Generalitat de Catalunya. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average annual temperature varies from {{convert|11|C|F}} in [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] in the south, to {{convert|8|C|F}} in [[La Massana]] in the centre, and to {{convert|2|C|F}} in [[Arcalis]] in the north.&lt;ref name="catmet"/&gt; The average daily high and low temperatures in [[Escaldes-Engordany]] are, respectively, {{convert|28|C|F}} and {{convert|15|C|F}} in July, and {{convert|11|C|F}} and {{convert|-2|C|F}} in January.&lt;ref name="wu1"/&gt;

Average annual precipitation is {{convert|1071.9|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} for the whole country,&lt;ref name="dss"/&gt; but it varies across the country, increasing with elevation and from south to north. The driest [[Parishes of Andorra|parish]] is [[Sant Julià de Lòria]] ({{convert|800|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year) in the south, and the wettest is [[Canillo]] ({{convert|1100|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} per year) in the north. Annual precipitation can exceed {{convert|1220|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} the highest mountainous areas. The driest months tend to be January and February, and the wettest, May, June, and November. During the summer months, there are very few rainy days, but the rainfall can be very heavy because it is associated with thunderstorms.&lt;ref name="catmet"/&gt;

==Natural resources==
Deposits of [[iron ore]], [[lead]], [[alum]], and building stones are among the resources exploited in Andorra, although the economy depends to a much greater extent on [[Tourism in Andorra|tourism]]. Andorra’s mountainous terrain attracts about 13 million tourists annually, primarily for skiing and hiking. The largest numbers of visitors come from Spain and France – 10,743,201 and 3,723,869 visitors, respectively, in 2007.&lt;ref name="dss"/&gt; It is also a popular destination for British tourists, accounting for one in seven of all British [[package holiday]]s — more than for Switzerland, Canada and the US combined.&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;M Clinch, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/holidaytypeshub/article-591549/A-postcard-Pyrenees.html A postcard from the Pyrenees], ''Daily Mail'', 2004-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural hazards==

===Avalanches===
There is a risk of avalanches from mid winter to early summer. [[Avalanche control]] methods such as snow clearing by controlled blast charges, [[snow net]]s, [[snow fence]]s, deflectors, rigid barriers, and snow compaction are used in Andorra to prevent dangerous avalanches.&lt;ref name="meffre1"&gt;JF Meffre (2001), [http://www.cenma.ad/webcenma/1%20JORNADES/MEFFRE.pdf La Predicció local del perill d'allaus a Andorra]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''La Gestió dels Riscos Naturals'', Jornades del CRECIT, pp.100–106, 13/14 September 2001. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Furdada, JM Vilaplana, E Tomàs, D Mas (1998).

The 1996 Arinsal avalanche was an exceptionally powerful powder-snow avalanche that followed several days of very heavy snowfalls and high winds.&lt;ref name="bd1"&gt;''Bon Dia'' newspaper, February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; At 19:00 on 8 February 1996, the avalanche fell on the village of [[Arinsal]] destroying or severely damaging many cars and buildings and hotels including the crest hotel the rocky mountain bar and above apartments the asterics bar and little damage to three blocks of flats that were under construction by a Russian company and still are under construction; evacuation of the residents and tourists in the village had been completed 1½&amp;nbsp;hours before the avalanche, and consequently no lives were lost, but the material and economic damages were large.&lt;ref name="bd1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meffre2"&gt;[http://www.avalanches.fr/construire/risque_2.htm Avalanche d'Arinsal en Andorre du 8 février 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323040051/http://www.avalanches.fr/construire/risque_2.htm |date=2009-03-23 }}, JF Meffre (Consellet tècnic en allaus, Servei de predicció d'allaus d'Andorra). {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the government ordered the construction of a snow dam across the Arinsal valley to stop future avalanches. The Arinsal snow dam, which is {{convert|16|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|320|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, cost 52&amp;nbsp;million [[French franc|francs]] and used {{convert|115000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of soil and {{convert|11000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of rock.&lt;ref name="meffre1"/&gt;

====1970 Pas de la Casa avalanche====
The 1970 Pas de la Casa avalanche was a powder-snow avalanche that happened after a severe snowstorm left {{convert|2|m|ft|sigfig=3}} of new snow atop the existing snow pack on the mountain slopes above [[Pas de la Casa]]. The avalanche began at an elevation of {{convert|2640|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on the upper slopes of the [[Pic d'Envalira]] ({{convert|2825|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), accelerated down the 35°&amp;nbsp;slope and spilled over six bends of the old CG-2 road that winds its way down the mountain to the village of Pas de la Casa, which is at {{convert|2100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. It then hit the village, damaging several buildings including a dispensary and killing a nurse.&lt;ref name="meffre2"/&gt; In 1970, Pas de la Casa had far fewer buildings than it does now, so the damage was relatively limited. In later years as development of the ski resort continued, plans for avalanche control measures were studied, but it was not until 1985 that strong protective features including {{convert|250|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} of windbreaks and {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} of snow fences were installed.&lt;ref name="meffre2"/&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="perdand1"/&gt;todo--&gt; The new CG-2 goes through the [[Envalira Tunnel]], thus avoiding Pas de la Casa and the risk of avalanches.

===Landslides===
Landslides are a frequent occurrence in Andorra; they have tended to follow periods of heavy rainfall.&lt;ref name="capons1"&gt;R Capons-Llorens (2005), [http://www.cenma.ad/webcenma/HORITZO/Horitz%C3%B3%208/H8article5.pdf El relleu postglacial al Principat d'Andorra – Les dinàmiques de vessants i fluviotorrencials]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Jornades del CRECIT – Horitzó, 8(2):25–33. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A landslide during the evening rush hour on 25 January 2008 deposited {{convert|4000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of loosely bound soil and rocks from the mountain slope above onto the main road CG-3 (Avinguda del Través de la Massana) between La Massana and Ordino, blocking it for three days, as well as completely covering an open-air car park and several parked cars. The only damage was to property, and nobody was injured, but the residents of a block of flats adjacent to the landslide were evacuated as the building was deemed unsafe and it remains vacant. The cause of the landslide was determined to be settlement of the earth due to inadequate ground reinforcement in the construction and excavation of the car park 30&amp;nbsp;years previously.&lt;ref name="da1"&gt;[http://www.diariandorra.ad/media/upload//pdf/obrir.php?file=da26a01_editora_17_505.pdf  L'esllavissada prové del desgast natural i l'excavació al pàrquing]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Diari d'Andorra'', No.5735, pp.1,3–4, 27 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3cat24a"&gt;[http://www.3cat24.cat/noticia/247731/societat/Una-esllavissada-talla-la-carretera-de-la-Massana-a-Ordino-i-obliga-a-desallotjar-els-veins Una esllavissada talla la carretera de la Massana a Ordino i obliga a desallotjar els veïns], ''3cat24'', 26 January 2008, {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2009, a rock landslide fell {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} onto the CG-3 main road between La Massana and Andorra La Vella, blocking the road near the entrance to the [[Pont Pla Tunnel]] for three hours.

===Earthquakes===
The Pyrenees and Catalonia have frequent and sometimes destructive earthquakes — the largest in recorded history being the [[Catalan earthquake of 1428]] with an estimated magnitude of IX on the [[Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale|MSK]] scale, equivalent to 6.0–6.5 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]].&lt;ref name="igc1"&gt;[http://www.igc.cat/web/gcontent/en/sismologia/igc_sismologia_sismicitat_seglexx.html Maximum felt intensities in Catalonia during the XX century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708134429/http://www.igc.cat/web/gcontent/en/sismologia/igc_sismologia_sismicitat_seglexx.html |date=2007-07-08 }}, Table I: Approximative correspondence between the magnitude (Richter) and the intensity (MSK) felt in the epicentral area.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="igc2"&gt;[http://www.igc.cat/web/gcontent/en/sismologia/igc_sismologia_sismicitat_mapa400m.html Sismicitat a Catalunya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708134151/http://www.igc.cat/web/gcontent/en/sismologia/igc_sismologia_sismicitat_mapa400m.html |date=2007-07-08 }}, Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya, 1999. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, earthquakes whose epicentres are inside Andorra tend to be smaller than magnitude&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref name="igc2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="igc3"&gt;[http://www.igc.cat/web/gcontent/ca/sismologia/sismescomact/llistats/locals/2001/juliol/locals.html Terratrèmols locals de Juliol de 2001] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607205626/http://www.igc.cat/web/gcontent/ca/sismologia/sismescomact/llistats/locals/2001/juliol/locals.html |date=2008-06-07 }}, Institut Geològic de Catalunya. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on 5 October 1999 in nearby [[Bagnères-de-Luchon]] (France) was widely felt in Andorra, causing public alarm.&lt;ref name="vwc1"&gt;[http://www.vilaweb.cat/www/noticia?p_idcmp=1114585 El terratremol espanta tot Andorra, pero no causa danys], ''VilaWeb.cat'', Maresma i Associats, SL. 1999-10-05. {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Andorran Government has studied the possibility of a damaging earthquake in Andorra.&lt;ref name="sost1"/&gt;

[[Image:Romania general map.png|thumb|right|General map of Romania.]]

With an area of 238,400 square kilometers, [[Romania]] is the twelfth-largest country in Europe. Located in [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]], bordering on the [[Black Sea]], the country is halfway between the equator and the [[North Pole]] and equidistant from the westernmost part of Europe—the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]]—and the most easterly—the [[Ural Mountains]]. Romania has 3,195 kilometers of border. [[Republic of Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]] lie to the east, [[Bulgaria]] lies to the south, and [[Serbia]] and [[Hungary]] to the west. In the southeast, 245 kilometers of sea coastline provide an important outlet to the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

==History==
Traditionally Romania is divided into several historic regions that no longer perform any administrative function:
[[File:Physical map of Romania.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Physical and administrative map of Romania, with the [[Historical regions of Romania|historic regions]] in grey (''Țara Românească'' means Wallachia).]][[Dobruja]] is the easternmost region, extending from the northward course of the Danube to the shores of the Black Sea.

[[Moldavia]] stretches from the [[Eastern Carpathians]] to the [[Prut River]] on the Moldovan and Ukrainian border.

[[Wallachia]] reaches south from the [[Transylvanian Alps]] to the Bulgarian border and is divided by the [[Olt River]] into [[Oltenia]] on the west and [[Muntenia]] on the east. The Danube forms a natural border between Muntenia and Dobruja.

The west-central region, known as [[Transylvania]], is delimited by the arc of the Carpathians, which separates it from the [[Maramureș region]] in the northwest; by the [[Crișana]] area, which borders Hungary in the west; and by the [[Banat]] region of the southwest, which adjoins both [[Hungary]] and [[Serbia]]. It is these areas west of the Carpathians that contain the highest concentrations of the nation's largest ethnic minorities—[[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], [[Transylvanian Saxons|Germans]], and [[Serbs]].

Romania's exterior boundaries are a result of relatively recent events. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], the country's territory included only the provinces of Walachia, Moldavia, and [[Dobruja]]. This area, known as the Regat or the [[Old Kingdom (Romania)|Old Kingdom]], came into being with the disintegration of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the mid-nineteenth century. At the end of World War I, Romania acquired Transylvania and the Banat. Some of this territory was lost during [[World War II]], but negotiations returned it to Romania. Although this acquisition united some 85 percent of the [[Romanian language|Romanian-speaking]] population of Eastern Europe into one nation, it left a considerable number of ethnic Hungarians under Romanian rule. Disputes between Hungary and Romania regarding this territory would surface regularly, as both considered the region part of their national heritage. Questions were also periodically raised as to the historical validity of the Soviet-Romanian border. [[Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]], former Romanian provinces where significant percentages of the population are Romanian-speaking, were part of the [[Soviet Union]] from the end of World War II to its dissolution, and subsequently part of the (formerly Soviet) states of Ukraine and [[Moldova]]. Despite ongoing and potential disputes, however, since 1989 Romania has no territorial claims to make. 

Romania's current administrative divisions include 41 counties and one city - Bucharest - with special status, see [[Administrative divisions of Romania]].

==Topography==
[[Image:Romania-relief.png|thumb|right|300px|Physical map of Romania showing the [[Carpathian Mountains]]]]
[[Image:RomGeolActual.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Geology of Romania and neighbours]]
{{main|Topography of Romania}}

Romania's natural landscape is almost evenly divided among [[Mountain|mountains]] (31 percent), [[Plain|plains]] (33 percent), and [[Hill|hills]] (36 percent). These varied relief forms spread rather symmetrically from the Carpathian Mountains, which reach elevations of more than 2,500 meters, to the Danube Delta, which is just a few meters above [[sea level]].

{{main|List of mountains in Romania}}
The arc of the Carpathians extends over 1,000 kilometers through the center of the country, covering an area of 71,000 square kilometers. These mountains are of low to medium altitude and are no wider than 100 kilometers. They are deeply fragmented by longitudinal and transverse valleys and crossed by several major rivers. These features and the fact that there are many summit passes—some at altitudes up to 2,256 meters—have made the Carpathians less of a barrier to movement than other European ranges. Another distinguishing feature is the many eroded platforms that provide tableland at relatively high altitudes. There are permanent settlements here at above 1,200 meters.

Romania's Carpathians are differentiated into three ranges: the [[Eastern Carpathians]], the [[Southern Carpathians]] or [[Transylvanian Alps]], and the [[Western Romanian Carpathians]]. Each of these ranges has important distinguishing features. The Eastern Carpathians are composed of three parallel ridges that run from northwest to southeast. The westernmost ridge is an extinct volcanic range with many preserved cones and craters. The range has many large depressions, in the largest of which the city of [[Brașov]] is situated. Important [[Mining industry of Romania|mining]] and industrial centers as well as agricultural areas are found within these depressions. The Eastern Carpathians are covered with forests—some 32 percent of the country's woodlands are there. They also contain important ore deposits, including gold and silver, and their mineral water springs feed numerous health resorts.
[[Image:Bucegi Sphinx, Romania.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Romanian [[Sphinx (Romania)|Sphinx]] situated on the plateau of [[Bucegi Mountains]] at 2,216 m. altitude, measures 8 meters in height and 12 meters in width]]
The Southern Carpathians offer the highest peaks at [[Moldoveanu Peak]] (2,544 m) and [[Negoiu]] (2,535 m) and more than 150 glacial lakes. They have large grassland areas and some woodlands but few large depressions and subsoil resources. At higher [[Elevation|elevations]], the wind and rain have turned the [[rock (geology)|rock]]s into spectacular figures such as the [[Sphinx (Romania)|Sphinx]] and ''[[Babele]]''.

The region was crisscrossed by an ancient network of trans-Carpathian roads, and vestiges of the old Roman Way are still visible. Numerous passes and the valleys of the Olt, Jiu, and Danube rivers provide routes for roads and railways through the mountains.

The Western Romanian Carpathians are the lowest of the three ranges and are fragmented by many deep structural depressions. They have historically functioned as "gates," which allow easy passage but can be readily defended. The most famous of these is the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] on the Danube. The Western Romanian Carpathians are the most densely settled, and it is in the northernmost area of this range, the Apuseni Mountains, that permanent settlements can be found at the highest [[Altitude|altitudes]].

Enclosed within the great arc of the Carpathians lie the undulating plains and low hills of the [[Transylvanian Plateau]]—the largest tableland in the country and the center of Romania. This important agricultural region also contains large deposits of methane gas and salt. To the south and east of the Carpathians, the [[Sub-Carpathians]] form a fringe of rolling terrain ranging from 396 to 1,006 meters in elevation. This terrain is matched in the west by the slightly lower [[Western Hills (Romania)|Western Hills]]. The symmetry of Romania's relief continues with the Getic Tableland to the south of the Sub-Carpathians, the [[Moldavian Tableland]] in the east between the Sub-Carpathians and the Prut River, and the [[Dobrujan Tableland]] in the southeast between the Danube and the Black Sea. The Sub-Carpathians and the tableland areas provide good conditions for human settlement and are important areas for fruit growing, [[viticulture]], and other agricultural activity. They also contain large deposits of [[Lignite|brown coal]] and [[natural gas]].

Beyond the Carpathian foothills and tablelands, the plains spread south and west. In the southern parts of the country, the lower Danube Plain is divided by the Olt River; east of the river lies the [[Wallachian Plain]], and to the west is the [[Oltenian Plain|Oltenian or Western Plain]]. The land here is rich with [[chernozem]]ic soils and forms Romania's most important farming region. Irrigation is widely used, and marshlands in the Danube's floodplain have been diked and drained to provide additional tillable land.

Romania's lowest land is found on the northern edge of the [[Dobruja]] region in the [[Danube Delta]]. The delta is a triangular swampy area of marshes, floating reed islands, and sandbanks, where the Danube ends its trek of almost 3,000 kilometers and divides into three frayed branches before emptying into the Black Sea. The Danube Delta provides a large part of the country's fish production, and its reeds are used to manufacture cellulose. The region also serves as a nature preserve for rare species of plant and animal life including migratory birds.

==Hydrography==
[[File:Cheile Turzii (Turda Gorges).jpg|thumb|right|[[Cheile Turzii]] and [[Hășdate River]] in [[Transylvania]].]]

===Rivers===
{{main|List of rivers of Romania}}
After entering the country in the southwest at Bazias, the [[Danube]] travels some 1,075 kilometers (almost 40% of its entire length) through or along Romanian territory, forming the southern frontier with Serbia and Bulgaria. Virtually all of the country's rivers are tributaries of the Danube, either directly or indirectly, and by the time the Danube's course ends in the Black Sea, they account for nearly 40 percent of the total discharge. The most important of these rivers are the [[Mureș River]], the [[Olt River]], the [[Prut]], the [[Siret River]], the [[Ialomița River]], the [[Someș River]], and the [[Argeș River]]. Romania's rivers primarily flow east, west, and south from the central crown of the Carpathians. They are fed by rainfall and melting snow, which causes considerable fluctuation in discharge and occasionally catastrophic [[Flood|flooding]]. In the east, river waters are collected by the Siret and the Prut. In the south, the rivers flow directly into the Danube, and in the west, waters are collected by the [[Tisza]] on Hungarian territory.

The Danube is by far Romania's most important river, not only for transportation, but also for the production of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]]. One of Europe's largest hydroelectric stations is located at the [[Iron Gates]], where the Danube surges through the Carpathian gorges. The Danube is an important water route for domestic [[Freight transport|shipping]], as well as international trade. It is navigable for river vessels along its entire Romanian course and for seagoing ships as far as the port of [[Brăila]]. An obvious problem with the use of the Danube for inland transportation is its remoteness from most of the major industrial centers. Moreover, marshy banks and perennial flooding impede navigation in some areas.

==Climate==
{{main|Climate of Romania}}
[[File:Romania map of Köppen climate classification.png|thumb|300px|Romania map of [[Köppen climate classification]], according with ''Clima României'' from the ''Administrația Națională de Meteorologie'', Bucharest 2008]]
Because of its position on the southeastern portion of the [[Europe|European]] continent, Romania has a climate that is transitional between temperate and continental. Climatic conditions are somewhat modified by the country's varied relief. The Carpathians serve as a barrier to Atlantic [[Air mass|air masses]], restricting their oceanic influences to the west and center of the country, where they make for milder winters and heavier [[Rain|rainfall]]. The mountains also block the continental influences of the vast plain to the north in Ukraine, which bring frosty winters and less rain to the south and southeast. In the extreme southeast, Mediterranean influences offer a milder, maritime climate. The average annual temperature is {{convert|11|°C|°F|1}} in the south and {{convert|8|°C|°F|1}} in the north. In Bucharest, the temperature ranges from {{convert|-29|°C|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|29|°C|°F|1}} in July, with average temperatures of {{convert|-3|°C|°F|1}} in January and {{convert|23|°C|°F|1}} in July. Rainfall, although adequate throughout the country, decreases from west to east and from mountains to plains. Some mountainous areas receive more than {{convert|1010|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation each year. Annual [[precipitation]] averages about {{convert|635|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in central Transylvania, {{convert|521|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} at Iași in Moldavia, and only {{convert|381|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} at Constanța on the Black Sea.

Temperate; cold, cloudy [[Winter|winters]] with frequent snow and fog; sunny summers with frequent showers and thunderstorms. Winters generally are from November to March. The [[Spring (season)|springs]] are short, occasionally turning right into summer. [[Summer]] lasts from May to August. They have a prolonged [[Autumn]], from September to November. The average January temperature is {{convert|34|°F|°C|1}} and the average July temperature is {{convert|69|°F|°C|1}}.
Facts: Record High Temperature: {{convert|44.5|°C|°F}} - August 10, 1951 South-Eastern Romania; Record Low Temperature: {{convert|-38.5|°C|°F|1}} - January 24, 1942 (Central Romania)

[[Cape Verde]] is a volcanic archipelago situated above an oceanic rise that puts the base of the islands {{convert|2|km|sp=us}} above the rest of the [[seafloor]]. Cape Verde has been identified as a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] and it has been argued that a [[mantle plume]] might be underneath it causing the [[volcanic activity]] and associated [[geothermal]] anomalies. 

Though Cape Verde's islands are all volcanic in origin, they vary widely in terrain.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; A [[Mount Fogo|still-active volcano on the island of Fogo]] is the highest point on the archipelago (elevation {{convert|2829|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name=pc&gt;[http://www.peacecorps.gov/welcomebooks/cvwb655.pdf ''The Peace Corps Welcomes You to Cape Verde'']. [[Peace Corps]] (April 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] are found on Sal and Maio.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; On Santiago, Santo Antão, and São Nicolau, arid slopes give way in places to sugarcane fields or banana plantations spread along the base of towering mountains.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

The islands are geologically principally composed of [[igneous]] rocks, with basic volcanics and pyroclastics comprising the majority of the total volume. The [[volcanic]] and [[pluton]]ic rocks are distinctly basic in character.  The archipelago is an example of a soda-alkaline [[petrographic province]], with a petrologic succession which is similar to that found in other Mid [[Atlantic]] islands.
[[Mount Fogo]] is an active [[volcano]] which most recently erupted in 2014. Fogo’s [[caldera]] is {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, the rim is at an elevation of {{convert|1600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} with an interior cone rising to {{convert|2830|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} from the crater's floor level.  Calderas probably result from the subsidence, following the partial evacuation of the [[magma]] chamber, of a cylindrical block into the supplying magma chamber, in this case lying at a depth of some {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.
The archipelago has been dated at approximately 180 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell-Thomé, Raoul C. "Outline of the geology of the Cape Verde Archipelago" Geologische Rundschau, Volume 61, Issue 3, pp.1087–1109&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41719">{{History of science and technology in China}}

[[List of Chinese inventions|Aside from many original inventions]], the [[Zhonghua minzu|Chinese]] were also early original pioneers in the discovery of natural phenomena which can be found in the [[human body]], the environment of the [[Earth|world]], and the immediate [[solar system]]. They also discovered many concepts in [[Chinese mathematics|mathematics]]. The list below contains discoveries which found their origins in [[China]].

== Discoveries ==
&lt;!-- Please list any additional items in alphabetical order --&gt;
&lt;!-- Any added material that is not correctly cited, with the full reference also not given in the reference section, will be removed. --&gt;

=== Ancient and imperial era ===
[[File:Guardians of Day and Night, Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|[[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC &amp;ndash; 220 AD) paintings on tile of Chinese guardian spirits representing 11 pm to 1 am (left) and 5 am to 7 am (right); the ancient Chinese, although discussing it in supernatural terms, acknowledged [[circadian rhythm]] within the human body]]

* '''[[Chinese remainder theorem]]''': The Chinese remainder theorem, including [[Modular arithmetic|simultaneous congruences]] in [[number theory]], was first created in the 3rd century AD in the mathematical book ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' posed the problem: "There is an unknown number of things, when divided by 3 it leaves 2, when divided by 5 it leaves 3, and when divided by 7 it leaves a remainder of 2. Find the number."&lt;ref name="ho 1991 516"&gt;Ho (1991), 516.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of calculation was used in calendrical mathematics by [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&amp;ndash;907) mathematicians such as [[Li Chunfeng]] (602&amp;ndash;670) and [[Yi Xing]] (683&amp;ndash;727) in order to determine the length of the "Great Epoch", the lapse of time between the conjunctions of the moon, sun, and Five Planets ([[Naked-eye planet|those discerned by the naked eye]]).&lt;ref name="ho 1991 516" /&gt; Thus, it was strongly associated with the [[divination]] methods of the ancient ''[[Yijing]]''.&lt;ref name="ho 1991 516" /&gt; Its use was lost for centuries until [[Qin Jiushao]] (c. 1202&amp;ndash;1261) revived it in his ''[[Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections]]'' of 1247, providing [[constructive proof]] for it.&lt;ref name="ho 1991 516" /&gt;
* '''[[Circadian rhythm|Circadian rhythm in humans]]''': The observation of a circadian or diurnal process in humans is mentioned in Chinese medical texts dated to around the 13th century, including the ''Noon and Midnight Manual'' and the ''Mnemonic Rhyme to Aid in the Selection of Acu-points According to the Diurnal Cycle, the Day of the Month and the Season of the Year''.&lt;ref name="cl"&gt;{{cite book |first = Gwei-Djen |last = Lu |title = Celestial Lancets |date = 25 October 2002 |publisher = Psychology Press |isbn = 978-0-7007-1458-2 |pages = 137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Decimal#Decimal fractions|Decimal fractions]]''': decimal fractions were used in [[Chinese mathematics]] by the 1st century AD, as evidenced by ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', while they appear in the works of [[Arabic mathematics]] by the 11th century (perhaps an import [[Indian mathematics|from India]]) and in [[History of mathematics|European mathematics]] by the 12th century, although the decimal point was not used until the work of Francesco Pellos in 1492 and not clarified until the 1585 publication of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] mathematician [[Simon Stevin]] (1548&amp;ndash;1620).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 24 25"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Diabetes|Diabetes, recognition and treatment of]]''': The ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' compiled by the 2nd century BC during the Han Dynasty identified diabetes as a disease suffered by those who had made an excessive habit of eating sweet and fatty foods, while the ''Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions'' written by the Tang Dynasty physician Zhen Quan (died 643) was the first known book to mention an excess of [[sugar]] in the [[urine]] of diabetic patients.&lt;ref name="medvei 1993 49"&gt;Medvei (1993), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bianzhong.jpg|thumb|Each [[bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng|bronze bell of Marquis Yi of Zeng]] (433 BC) bears an inscription describing the specific note it plays, its position on a [[Musical scale|12-note scale]], and how this scale differed from scales [[Warring States period|used by other Chinese states]] of the time; before this discovery in 1978, the oldest known surviving Chinese tuning set came from [[Guanzi (text)|a 3rd-century BC text]] (which alleges was written by [[Guan Zhong]], d. 645 BC) with five tones and additions or subtractions of ⅓ of successive tone values which produce the [[Circle of fifths|rising fourths and falling fifths]] of [[Pythagorean comma|Pythagorean tuning]].&lt;ref&gt;McClain and Ming (1979), 206.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* '''[[Equal temperament]]''': During the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&amp;ndash;220 AD), the [[Music theory|music theorist]] and mathematician [[Jing Fang]] (78&amp;ndash;37 BC) extended [[Chromatic scale|the 12 tones]] found in the 2nd century BC ''[[Huainanzi]]'' to 60.&lt;ref&gt;McClain and Ming (1979), 207&amp;ndash;208.&lt;/ref&gt; While generating his 60-divisional tuning, he discovered that 53 [[just fifth]]s is approximate to 31 [[octave]]s, calculating the difference at &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{177147}{176776}&lt;/math&gt;; this was exactly the same value for [[53 equal temperament]] calculated by the [[Germans|German]] mathematician [[Nicholas Mercator]] (c. 1620&amp;ndash;1687) as 3&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;, a value known as [http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/m/mercator-comma.aspx Mercator's Comma].&lt;ref&gt;McClain and Ming (1979), 212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 218&amp;ndash;219.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) music theorist [[Zhu Zaiyu]] (1536&amp;ndash;1611) elaborated in three separate works beginning in 1584 the tuning system of equal temperament. In an unusual event in music theory's history, the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] mathematician [[Simon Stevin]] (1548&amp;ndash;1620) discovered the mathematical formula for equal temperament at roughly the same tim, yet he did not publish his work and it remained unknown until 1884 (whereas the ''Harmonie Universelle'' written in 1636 by [[Marin Mersenne]] is considered the first publication in Europe outlining equal temperament); therefore, it is debatable who discovered equal temperament first, Zhu or Stevin.&lt;ref&gt;Kuttner (1975), 166&amp;ndash;168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 227&amp;ndash;228.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain [[Interval (music)|equal intervals]], Zhu divided the octave (each octave with a ratio of 1:2, which can also be expressed as 1:2&lt;sup&gt;12/12&lt;/sup&gt;) into twelve equal [[semitone]]s while each length was divided by the 12th root of 2.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 223"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 1, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not simply divide the string into twelve equal parts (i.e. 11/12, 10/12, 9/12, etc.) since this would give unequal temperament; instead, he altered the ratio of each semitone by an equal amount (i.e. 1:2 &lt;sup&gt;11/12&lt;/sup&gt;, 1:2&lt;sup&gt;10/12&lt;/sup&gt;, 1:2&lt;sup&gt;9/12&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.) and determined the exact length of the string by dividing it by {{radic|2|12}} (same as 2&lt;sup&gt;1/12&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 223"/&gt; 
* '''[[Gaussian elimination]]''': First published [[Western world|in the West]] by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777&amp;ndash;1855) in 1826, the algorithm for [[System of linear equations|solving linear equations]] known as Gaussian elimination is named after this [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanoverian]] mathematician, yet it was first expressed as the Array Rule in the Chinese ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'', written at most by 179 AD during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC&amp;ndash;220 AD) and commented on by the 3rd century mathematician [[Liu Hui]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 24&amp;ndash;25, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shen, Crossley, and Lun (1999), 388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Straffin (1998), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxalis corniculata 1.JPG|thumb|Aware of underground minerals associated with certain plants by at least the 5th century BC, the Chinese extracted trace elements of [[copper]] from ''[[Oxalis corniculata]]'', pictured here, as written in the 1421 text ''Precious Secrets of the Realm of the King of Xin''.]]

[[File:Likan Bamboo and Rocks.jpg|thumb|Bamboo and rocks by Li Kan (1244&amp;ndash;1320); using evidence of fossilized bamboo found in a dry northern climate zone, [[Shen Kuo]] hypothesized that [[Climate change|climates naturally shifted geographically over time]].]]

* '''[[Geomorphology]]''': In his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088, [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&amp;ndash;1095) wrote about a landslide (near modern [[Yan'an]]) where  petrified [[bamboo]]s were discovered in a preserved state underground, in the dry northern climate zone of [[Shanbei]], [[Shaanxi]]; Shen reasoned that since bamboo was known only to grow in damp and humid conditions, the climate of this northern region must have been different in the very distant past, postulating that climate change occurred over time.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Clancey, Loy (2002), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 614.&lt;/ref&gt; Shen also advocated a hypothesis in line with [[geomorphology]] after he observed a stratum of marine fossils running in a horizontal span across a cliff of the [[Taihang Mountains]], leading him to believe that it was once the location of an ancient shoreline that had shifted hundreds of km (mi) east over time (due to deposition of silt and other factors).&lt;ref&gt;Sivin (1995), III, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 603&amp;ndash;604, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Grid reference]]''': Although professional map-making and use of the grid had [[History of cartography#China|existed in China before]], the Chinese cartographer and geographer [[Pei Xiu]] of the Three Kingdoms period was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid reference and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ancient Inventions |last=Thorpe |first=I. J. |last2=James |first2=Peter J. |last3=Thorpe |first3=Nick |publisher=Michael O'Mara Books Ltd |year=1996 |isbn=978-1854796080 |publication-date=March 8, 1996 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 106 107"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 106&amp;ndash;107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538 540"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 538&amp;ndash;540.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Howard Nelson asserts that there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the idea of the grid reference from the map of [[Zhang Heng]] (78&amp;ndash;139 CE), a polymath inventor and statesman of the Eastern Han dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 359.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pascal's Triangle|Jia Xian triangle]]''': This triangle was the same as Pascal's Triangle, discovered by [[Jia Xian]] in the first half of the 11th century, about six centuries before [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]. Jia Xian used it as a tool for extracting [[square root|square]] and [[cubic root]]s. The original book by Jia Xian titled ''Shi Suo Suan Shu'' was lost; however, Jia's method was expounded in detail by [[Yang Hui]], who explicitly acknowledged his source: "My method of finding square and cubic roots was based on the Jia Xian method in ''Shi Suo Suan Shu''."&lt;ref&gt;Wu Wenjun chief ed, ''The Grand Series of History of Chinese Mathematics'' Vol 5 Part 2, chapter 1, Jia Xian&lt;/ref&gt; A page from the Yongle Encyclopedia preserved this historic fact.

[[File:Gandhi leper.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] tends to a leper; the Chinese were the first to describe the symptoms of [[leprosy]].]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10841">{{refimprove|date=May 2017}}{{Latin place names}}

This list includes [[Asia]]n [[countries]] and [[regions]] 
that were part of the [[Roman Empire]],  or that were given [[Latin]] place names in [[historical]] [[Reference work|references]].

==Background==
Until the [[Modern Era]], [[Latin]] was the [[Lingua franca|common language]] for [[scholarship]] and [[Cartography|mapmaking]]. During the 19th and 20th centuries, [[Germany|German]] scholars in particular have made significant contributions to the study of historical place names, or ''[[Ortsnamenkunde]]''. These studies have, in turn, contributed to the study of [[genealogy]]. For genealogists and historians of pre-Modern Europe, knowing alternate names of places is vital to extracting information from both public and private records. Even specialists in this field point out, however, that the information can be easily taken out of context, since there is a great deal of repetition of place names throughout Europe; reliance purely on apparent connections should therefore be tempered with valid historical methodology.

==Caveats and notes==
Latin place names are not always exclusive to one place &amp;mdash; for example, there were several Roman cities whose names began with ''Colonia'' and then a more descriptive term. During the [[Middle Ages]], these were often shortened to just ''Colonia''. One of these, ''Colonia Agrippinensis'', retains the name today in the form of [[Cologne]].

Early sources for [[ancient Rome|Roman]] names show numerous variants and spellings of the [[Latin]] names.

The modern canonical name is listed first. 
Sources are listed chronologically. 
In general, only the earliest source is shown for each name, 
although many of the names are recorded in more than one of the sources. 
Where the source differs in spelling, 
or has other alternatives, 
these are listed following the source. 
As an aid to searching, 
variants are spelled completely, 
and listed in most likely chronology.

Superscripts indicate:
# Latinized form of the Greek-derived name.
# Latinized form of the Asian-derived name via Greek.
# Altered Latinized form of the Greek-derived name.

An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers.

Since 1994, there have been a large number of places in [[South Africa]] which have been renamed for political, ethnic, or even economic reasons. These name changes were at first to remove politically motivated, incorrectly spelt or offensive names (such as those named after [[apartheid]] leaders) from the South African landscape. However, since 2000 these name changes have targeted places of mostly Afrikaans but also English-speaking origin, with many places now named after anti-apartheid activists. The following article covers the name changes in South Africa by province since the [[South African general election, 1994|first multi-racial elections in 1994]].

A number of places in South Africa had been renamed before 1994. These name changes were much rarer and occurred over long periods of time.

== Eastern Cape ==
[[File:Eastern Cape in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]
As of March 2014, the Eastern Cape has changed the name of 134 places, placing it third nationally after Mpumalanga and the Limpopo provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Where-the-hell-are-we-20150429 News24.com / ''where the hell are we?'' - accessed on 22/11/15]&lt;/ref&gt; Most name changes have been correcting misspellings in the former homelands of [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]] (see below). There have also been a number of name change proposals in the western half of the province for places of Afrikaans or English origin.

=== Settlements ===
*Bisho → [[Bhisho]] (2004; former capital of Ciskei)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=59811 http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=59811]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313132518/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=59811 |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cala → [[Kala, South Africa|Kala]] (2004)
*Engcobo → [[Ngcobo]] (2004) 
*Idutywa → [[Dutywa]] (2004) 
*Umtata → [[Mthatha]] (2004; former capital of Transkei)
*[[Grahamstown]] → Makhanda (2018; name to be officially changed soon)

=== Airports ===
*[[Ben Schoeman]] Airport → [[East London Airport]] (1994)
*[[Hendrik Verwoerd|H. F. Verwoerd]] Airport → [[Port Elizabeth Airport|Port Elizabeth International Airport]] (1994)
*[[Kaiser Matanzima|K. D. Matanzima]] Airport → [[Mthatha Airport]] (2004)&lt;!-- referred to as Mthatha Airport in sources dated from early 2005 --&gt;

== Free State ==
[[File:Free State in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]
The Free State has only experienced minor name changes. A number of settlements have been slated for renaming but none have thus far gone ahead. [[Bloemfontein]], the provincial capital, is planned to be renamed ''Mangaung'' after the township it borders and the municipality it lies in.

The province recently renamed [[Bloemfontein Airport|its only international airport]] in [[Bloemfontein]] after anti-apartheid activist [[Bram Fischer]]. The airport's name had to be changed twice after the first renaming forgot to add ''international'' to the name.

== Gauteng ==
[[File:Gauteng in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]
Gauteng, South Africa's most urbanised province, has seen a number of name changes. Probably the most controversial name change in South African history has been that of [[Pretoria]], where there have been proposals to change the city's name to [[Tshwane]] (already the name of the metropolitan area it lies in).

=== Settlements ===
*[[Verwoerdburg]] → [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] (1994) 
**The first name change in post-1994 South Africa. Verwoerdburg was named after [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], the so-called "architect of [[Apartheid]]" and was deemed offensive to many people and was changed to the neutral name of '''Centurion'''.
*Sophiatown → Triomf (1954) → [[Sophiatown, Gauteng|Sophiatown]] (2006)
**In 2006 the suburb of Triomf had its name restored to Sophiatown. Before 1954 the area (then named Sophiatown) was mostly occupied by blacks but were forcibly moved due to it being near local white suburbs. The area was rezoned as '''Triomf''' (Afrikaans for "Triumph") with the former name restored 52 years later.

=== Streets ===

==== Johannesburg ====
* In 2001 The Johannesburg City Administration changed the name of DF Malan Drive to [[Beyers Naudé Drive]]. Also it changed the name of the Library Gardens to [[Beyers Naudé Square]] in order to commemorate [[Beyers Naudé]].
In 2007 the Johannesburg Development Agency changed two streetnames named after Apartheid era ministers:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/hendrik-verwoerd-drive-is-no-longer-357676|title=Hendrik Verwoerd Drive is no longer {{!}} IOL|website=IOL|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Henrik Verwoerd Drive → [[Bram Fischer]] Drive
* [[Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom|Hans Strijdom]] road → [[Malibongwe Drive]]

In 2014 the city administration continued the renaming of important streets in the city in order to "celebrate the city's shared past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=9175:new-street-names-celebrate-joburgs-shared-past-and-future&amp;Itemid=266|title=city of Johannesburg - New street names celebrate Joburg’s shared past … and future|last=Yollie|website=www.joburg.org.za|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sauer Street → Pixley ka Isaka Seme Street
* Bree Street → Lilian Ngoyi Street
* Jeppe Street  → Rahima Moosa Street
* Presidents Street → Helen Joseph Street
* Noord Street → Sophie de Bruyn Street

==== Pretoria ====
In early 2012, 27 streets in central Pretoria had their name changed to reflect a "shared history" of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshwane.gov.za/sites/Departments/City-Planning-and-Development/Streetnames%20Changes/List%20of%20Renamed%20Streets.pdf Tshwane.gov.za (new street names for central Pretoria) - retrieved 4th February 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://showme.co.za/pretoria/tourism/pretorias-new-street-names/|title=Pretoria’s New Street Names|website=showme.co.za|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The streets renamed were;

=== Airports ===
* [[Jan Smuts]] International Airport  → Johannesburg International Airport (1994) → [[O. R. Tambo International Airport]]

== KwaZulu-Natal ==
[[File:KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]
The KwaZulu-Natal province was formed in 1994 from the merger of the then province of [[Natal Province|Natal]] and former bantustan of [[KwaZulu]].

=== Settlements ===
*Stanger → [[KwaDukuza]] (2006)
**KwaDukuza was the historic capital of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] but was burnt to the ground in 1828. In 1873 European settlers founded the town '''Stanger''' on the site. The town is still commonly and also sometimes officially referred to as Stanger despite being renamed to KwaDukuza in 2006.

=== Dams ===
*Chelmsford Dam → [[Ntshingwayo Dam]] (2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewisa.co.za/misc/DamKZNNtshingwayo/default.htm Ewisa.co.za, name change occurred in 2000] - Retrieved 12/09/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Airport ===
Durban International Airport (Old Airport) → [[King Shaka International Airport]]

== Limpopo ==
[[File:Limpopo in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]
[[File:N1 Pietersburg Pretoria.jpg|right|thumb|Old [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] sign showing the city of [[Polokwane]]'s former name Pietersburg]]
[[File:N1 (South Africa), Pretoria (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|N1 sign showing [[Polokwane]]'s new name]]
The most northerly province of South Africa, the Limpopo province saw some of the earliest name changes and to date more than any other province. The province was carved out of the former [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and initially named the '''Northern-Transvaal''' until the following year when it was known simply as the '''Northern Province'''. It kept this name until 2002&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/All-but-2-Limpopo-towns-renamed-20050628|title=All but 2 Limpopo towns renamed|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was renamed after the [[Limpopo River]] which forms South Africa's border with [[Zimbabwe]]. Settlement name changes especially targeted places of Afrikaans origin, such as Pietersburg (Polokwane), Nylstroom (Modimolle) and Ellisras (Lephalale), while avoiding places with Bantu or English names such as [[Northam, Limpopo|Northam]], [[Alldays, Limpopo|Alldays]], [[Tzaneen]] and [[Thabazimbi]]. The Limpopo is the most ethnically black province in South Africa (96.7% as of 2011) and is likely to have made the name changes go smoother because of a lack of opposition from minority groups which are usually against name changes.

=== Settlements ===
*Warmbaths (Afrikaans: Warmbad) → '''[[Bela-Bela]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
*Ellisras → '''[[Lephalale]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
*Louis Trichardt → Makhado (2003) → '''[[Louis Trichardt]]''' (2007)&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
**The town was renamed Makhado in 2003, but was later in 2007 reverted to the original name of Louis Trichardt.
*Nylstroom → '''[[Modimolle]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
*Duiwelskloof → '''[[Modjadjiskloof]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
**Unlike most name changes, Duiwelskloof kept the Afrikaans suffix "-kloof" (meaning valley) in its new name. The name "Ngoako Ramalepe" was also proposed.
*Dendron → '''[[Mogwadi]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
*Potgietersrus → '''[[Mokopane]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
*Naboomspruit → '''[[Mookgophong]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
**The new name has sometimes been incorrectly spelled "Mookgopong".
*Soekmekaar → [[Morebeng]] 
**Morebeng has also been spelt "'Morbeng"
*Messina → '''[[Musina]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
*Pietersburg → '''[[Polokwane]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt; (capital)
**Polokwane was at first sometimes misspelled as "Pholokwane".
*Bochum → '''[[Senwabarwana]]'''&lt;ref name=news24-limpopo/&gt;
*Vaalwater → Mabatlane (2006) → [[Vaalwater]] (2007)

== Mpumalanga ==
[[File:Mpumalanga in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]
Mpumalanga, itself renamed in 1995 from the '''Eastern Transvaal''', has seen the entire northern half of the province renamed since 2005. As with the Limpopo province, most of the changes have targeted places of Afrikaans origin, but also some with British links. These have included the capital, Nelspruit (Mbombela) as well as Witbank (eMalahleni) and Lydenburg (Mashishing). Unlike the Limpopo, the name changes in Mpumalanga have largely (as of 2011) been ignored and apart from the city of Witbank, road signs and usage of the new names has been rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Residents-stick-to-old-city-names-20110809|title=Residents stick to 'old' city names|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of settlements of Bantu origin have also changed their names because they were misspelled by early settlers such as [[Malelane]] which was renamed to [[Malalane|Mal'''a'''lane]].

=== Settlements ===
*[[Lydenburg]] → Mashishing (2006)
*[[Witbank]] → eMalahleni (2006)
*[[Belfast, Mpumalanga|Belfast]] → eMakhazeni (2009)&lt;ref name=mpumalanga.gov.za&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpumalanga.gov.za/news/names.htm|title=New geographical name changes in Mpumalanga - Mpumalanga Provincial  Government|work=mpumalanga.gov.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Machadodorp]] → eNtokozweni (2009)&lt;ref name=mpumalanga.gov.za/&gt;
*[[Nelspruit]] → Mbombela (2009)&lt;ref name=mpumalanga.gov.za/&gt; (capital)
*[[Waterval Boven]] → Emgwenya (2009)&lt;ref name=mpumalanga.gov.za/&gt;
*[[Piet Retief]] → emKhondo (2010)
*[[Hectorspruit]] → [[Emjejane]] (2005)

== North West ==
[[File:North West in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]

In May 2013 North West province premier [[Thandi Modise]] said the province needed to be renamed and not just be referred to as a "direction on a compass".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Premier-North-West-needs-name-change-20130523 News24 North West name change] Retrieved 8/9/2013&lt;/ref&gt; One of the suggestions has been to rename North West after politician and activist [[Moses Kotane]]. There is, however, [[Moses Kotane Local Municipality|already a municipality]] in the province named after him.

=== Settlements ===
*Mafeking → Mafikeng → [[Mahikeng]]
**British settlers first spelt the town as '''Mafeking''' but was renamed '''Mafikeng''' in 1980 upon incorporation into the bantustan [[Bophuthatswana]]. In February 2010 the town was again renamed to Mahikeng. Residents still refer to the town as Mafikeng both informally and formally.

== Northern Cape ==
[[File:Northern Cape in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]
The Northern Cape is the only province in South Africa not having undergone any known significant name changes since 1994. The province has an Afrikaans speaking majority and it's unlikely therefore the local population favour any name changes.

== Western Cape ==
[[File:Western Cape in South Africa.svg|right|150px]]
[[File:Kaapstad16.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Helen Suzman Boulevard in [[Cape Town]], renamed from Western Boulevard in 2011]]
Similarly to the Northern Cape as noted [[Renaming in South Africa#Northern Cape|above]], the Western Cape has experienced only a few minor street name changes in the largest cities, but have escaped major name changes of cities and towns because the majority of the population are not Black, but instead Afrikaans or English-speaking Coloureds. Since 2007 the Western Cape has also the highest percentage of white residents (having overtaken Gauteng), which stood in 2007 at 18.4%. There have, however, been a number of suggested name changes, particularly on the southern coast of the province such as for the towns of [[George, Western Cape|George]] or [[Mossel Bay]].

=== Streets ===
Four street names have already been changed: Oswald Pirow was changed to Chris Barnard Street, Eastern Boulevard took Nelson Mandela's name, while the concourse between the Artscape theatre and the Civic Centre was renamed after [[Albert Luthuli]]. The pedestrian section of Castle Street is to be renamed after [[Khoisan]] leader [[Krotoa]]. Table Bay Boulevard was renamed as [[FW de Klerk]] Boulevard.
An additional change – Western Boulevard to Helen Suzman Boulevard – was introduced by special council resolution.

=== Airports ===
[[Daniel François Malan|D.F. Malan]] Airport → [[Cape Town International Airport]] (1994) → name to be changed soon (name has not been finalised yet) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ewn.co.za/2018/06/01/process-to-rename-ct-international-airport-underway|title=Process to rename CT International Airport underway|last=Matangira|first=Lungelo|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape and its characteristics are dominated by two rivers, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and the [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]].&lt;ref name="Lewis2"&gt;Lewis, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

When Spanish settlers came to the area, the two parallel rivers and the lush area between them drew comparisons to [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Μεσοποταμία "land between rivers") in modern-day [[Iraq]], and it was decided to name the Argentine region for the Iraqi region. The region shares many of its ecological features with neighboring regions of Argentina and with parts of [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]].

Mesopotamia has some of the most popular tourist attractions in Argentina, mainly the [[Iguazu Falls|Iguazú Falls]], the [[Iguazú National Park]] and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] mission stations in Misiones. The [[Iberá Wetlands]] in Corrientes are an extensive area of flooded forest similar to Brazil's [[Pantanal]].

The region is part of the Brazilian central plateau. The whole region has high [[rainfall]],&lt;ref name="Lewis2"/&gt; particularly in August and September, up to 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm annually. Misiones, in the northern part of Mesopotamia, is largely covered by [[subtropical]] forest, with [[caiman]], [[toucan]]s and [[monkey]]s. Fast decomposition of organic matter gives the area a red soil with only a thin fertile layer that can easily be washed away. Corrientes is marshy and wooded, with low hills. Entre Ríos is covered with fertile pasture land stretching into Uruguay.

The [[flora (plants)|flora]] of Mesopotamia includes the yatay [[palm tree|palm]] (''Syagrus yatay'', ''[[Butia yatay]]''), which is a protected species in the [[El Palmar National Park]], and the ''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'' (Paraná pine tree). [[Tree fern]]s, [[orchid]]s and large trees can also be found.

''[[Yerba mate]]'' (''Ilex paraguariensis'') is grown largely in Mesopotamia;&lt;ref name="Lewis2"/&gt; 1,800 square kilometres of Misiones are devoted to its production. The region is also important for cattle and sheep, poultry, [[linseed]], [[tobacco]], citrus and rice.

[[Gualeguaychú, Entre Ríos|Gualeguaychú]] in Entre Ríos is popular for its [[carnival]] at the beginning of [[Lent]]. Corrientes is also known for its carnival celebrations and is a centre of music and festivals generally: the [[chamamé]] music style has recently seen a resurgence in popularity.

The region called [[Argentine littoral|Litoral]] (Spanish for coastal) consists of the Mesopotamia and the provinces of [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], [[Formosa Province|Formosa]] and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]].

A '''nāḥiyah''' ({{lang-ar|{{big|ناحية}}}} {{IPA-ar|ˈnæːħijæ|}}, plural ''nawāḥī'' {{lang|ar|{{big|نواحي}}}} {{IPA-ar|næˈwæːħiː|}}), or '''nahia''', is a regional or local type of [[administrative division]] that usually consists of a number of villages and/or sometimes smaller towns. In [[Tajikistan]], it is a second-level division while in [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Xinjiang]], and the former [[administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]], where it was also called a ''[[bucak (administrative unit)|bucak]]'', it is a third-level or lower division. It can constitute a division of a ''[[qadaa]]'', ''[[mintaqah]]'' or other such [[district]]-type of division and is sometimes translated as "[[subdistrict]]".

'''North Little Rock''' is a city in [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]], [[Arkansas]], United States, across the [[Arkansas River]] from [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] in the central part of the state. The population was 62,304 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. In 2017 the estimated population was 65,911,&lt;ref name="2017 Pop Estimate"&gt;{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml#|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the seventh-most populous city in the state. North Little Rock, along with [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and [[Conway, Arkansas|Conway]], anchors the six-county Little Rock&amp;ndash;North Little Rock&amp;ndash;Conway [[Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (2014 population 729,135), which is further included in the Little Rock-North Little Rock [[Central Arkansas|Combined Statistical Area]] with 902,443 residents.

The city's downtown is anchored in the '''Argenta''' Historic District, which draws its name from the original name of the city; the area includes [[Dickey-Stephens Park]], the current home of the [[Arkansas Travelers]] minor league baseball team, and [[Verizon Arena]], the metropolitan area's main entertainment venue. Farther west in the city is [[Burns Park (North Little Rock, Arkansas)|Burns Park]], one of the largest municipal parks in the United States.

==History==
North Little Rock has a long history, dating back to the Burial Mound People.&lt;ref&gt;See Adams, Walter M., "A History of North Little Rock The Unique City" (1986, August House)({{ISBN|0874830028}}).&lt;/ref&gt; It was once known as Argenta, a name that currently applies specifically to [[downtown]] North Little Rock.  In 1890, Little Rock annexed the unincorporated Argenta community as its Eighth Ward, preempting a competing petition to incorporate Argenta.  A neighboring area was incorporated as the Town of North Little Rock in 1901 as part of a plan to reclaim the Eighth Ward from Little Rock.  By 1904, the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] allowed the town to annex the Eighth Ward; the modern City of North Little Rock considers this its founding date.  The combined city adopted the Argenta name by 1906, but reverted to North Little Rock in October 1917.  A remnant of the city's earliest years can be found in North Little Rock City Hall (constructed in 1914), which still contains plaques referring to "Argenta", and contains "C of A" (City of Argenta) ornamental designs.

==Geography==
North Little Rock is located at {{coord|34|46|51|N|92|15|25|W|type:city}} (34.780791, -92.256881).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|47.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|44.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|2.2|sqmi|km2}} (4.58%) is water.

===Highways===
North Little Rock is also the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 30]] and southern terminus of the Arkansas-designated portion of [[Interstate 57]]. [[Interstate 40 in Arkansas|Interstate 40]], [[U.S. Route 65 in Arkansas|US 65]], [[U.S. Route 67 in Arkansas|US 67]], and [[U.S. Route 167 in Arkansas|US 167]] all run through the city.

=== Climate ===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid [[summer]]s and generally mild to cool [[winter]]s.

}}[[File:Ligue-latine-carte.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Latium with the cities of the Latin League]]
'''Old Latium''' ({{lang-la|Latium vetus}} or ''{{lang|la|Latium antiquum}}'') is a region of the [[Italian peninsula]] bounded to the north by the [[river Tiber]], to the east by the central [[Apennine mountains]], to the west by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and to the south by [[Monte Circeo]]. It was the territory of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], an [[Italic tribe]] which included the early inhabitants of the city of [[Rome]]. Later it was also settled by various Italic tribes such as the [[Rutulians]], [[Volscians]], [[Aequi]], and [[Hernici]].&lt;ref&gt;Strabon ''Geography'' III 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The region was referred to as "old" to distinguish it from the expanded region, [[Latium]], that included the region to the south of Old Latium, between [[Mount Circeo|Monte Circeo]] and the river [[Garigliano]] - the so-called [[Latium adiectum]] ("attached Latium").  It corresponded to the central part of the modern administrative region of [[Lazio]], [[Italy]], and it covered an area measuring of roughly 50 [[Roman miles]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''NH'' III 56.&lt;/ref&gt; It was calculated by [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] that the region's area was about 1860 square kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;T. Mommsen ''History of Rome'' I 3, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement==

===Literary tradition===
[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] has preserved extensive information on the settlement of Latium in his book, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Roman Antiquities''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', where he listed and discussed many legends and traditional stories related by historians and scholars, both Greek and Roman, on how Latium was settled. [[Pliny the Elder]] also wrote about Old Latium. In his book '''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', he lists two settlements in Old Latium that at the time of writing had disappeared. Other important literary sources include [[Livy]], [[Strabo]], [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], and [[Servius Danielis]].

According to these sources Latium was first settled long ago by [[Sicels]] and [[Ligures]],&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v.  ''sacrani'' p. 424 L: "''Sacrani'' are named those who moved from Reate and expelled the Sicels and Ligures from the ''Septimontium''"; Servius Danielis ''Ad Aeneidem'' XI 371, VIII ; Dionysius of  Halicarnassus ''RA'' I  12, 2 citing  Sophocles's ''Triptolemus'' on Oenotrians and Ligures settling the coasts of the Tyrrhenian Sea.&lt;/ref&gt; but many sources contradict or do not state which of the two groups first settled Latium. According to the literary tradition, the Sicels and Ligures were forced out of Latium by the constant pressure exerted by the [[Aborigines (mythology)|Aborigines]], who dwelt in [[Reate]], causing the Ligures to migrate to [[Liguria]] and the Sicels to [[Sicily]]. The migration of the tribes appears to have been from the hills and mountains of the region down towards the plains, although there are testimonies of Greek colonizers migrating by sea into the region, as in the legend of [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]], and to southern Italy, as the Sicels were considered to be both [[Oenotrians]] of Greek origin,&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Hal. ''RA''  I 12, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rutulians|Rutulian]] of [[Dauni|Daunian]] origin.

The arrival of the [[Aeneads]] and the founding of [[Lavinium]] are claimed to mark the beginning of civilization in Latium, and 30 years after these events [[Alba Longa|Alba]] was founded, the city that led the [[Latin League]], a coalition of 30 cities and tribes that lasted for 500 years. While there are many different myths on the founding of these cities, it is known that the region and the Latin League were religiously influenced by the cult of Iuppiter Latiaris,  an [[Epithets of Jupiter|epithet of Jupiter]], and venerated this god as the high protector of the league.

====Pliny's list====
The accounting provided by Pliny the Elder does not include all the centres of Latium Vetus that later developed into towns, but rather lists those which, according to the scholar, had disappeared by his time without leaving any trace. Therefore, he does not mention [[Anxur]], [[Tibur]], [[Cora (Ancient Latin town)|Cora]], [[Ficulea]], [[Nomentum]], [[Praeneste]], [[Gabii]], [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], [[Ariccia|Aricia]], [[Tusculum]], [[Lavinium]], [[Laurentum]], [[Lanuvium]], [[Labicum]], and [[Velitrae]], which were still standing, with the exception of old Labicum. But some settlements he mentions were in fact visited by Strabo only seventy years earlier (such as [[Tellenae]]), and some still certainly stood in his own time, such as [[Pedum]]. Another oddity of the passage is that while he claims there were fifty-three centres that had disappeared, his list numbers only fifty. Even though elsewhere he mentions two other sites, [[Apiolae]] and [[Amyclae (Italy)|Amyclae]], this still does not equal fifty-three. The list is in book III of his ''Natural History'' ch. 68 and 69:

"In the first region moreover in Latium were the famous walled towns (''clara oppida'') [[Satricum]], Scaptia, [[Politorium]], [[Tellena]], [[Tifata]], [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Ficana]], [[Crustumeria]], [[Ameriola]], [[Medullum]], [[Corniculum]], Saturnia now which is Rome, Antipolis (which is now the [[Janiculum]], a place in Rome), [[Antemnae]], [[Cameria|Camerium]], [[Collatia]], [[Amitinum]], [[Norba]], and [[Sulmo]]. Together with them the Alban Peoples who use to receive the (sacrificial) meat on the Alban Mount: Albani, Aesolani, Accienses, Abolani, Bubetani, Bolani, Cusuetani, Coriolani, Fidenates, Foreti, Hortenses, Latinienses, Longani, Manates, Macrales, Munienses, Numinienses, Olliculani, Octulani, Pedani, Poletaurini, Querquetulani, Sicani, Sisolenses, Tolerienses, Tutienses, Vimitellari, Velienses, Venetulani, Vitellienses."

The list is apparently made up of two sections, the first is referred to as ''clara oppida'' and the second as ''populi Albenses''. The last two towns mentioned among the ''clara oppida'', Norba and Sulmo, were in fact within Latium Adiectum. They were destroyed in the 1st{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BC during the war between Marius and Sulla.

The second section gives the names of the ''populi Albenses''. These were local communities inhabiting the region of ''Mons Albanus'' (now Monte Cavo) and its immediate surroundings, the Alban Hills. Only some of them seem to have reached the urban stage and the list reflects the typical archaic [[Bronze Age]] organization of  human settlement: sparse, polycentric and gravitating around a religious centre, in this case the sanctuary of ''Iuppiter Latiaris''. The exact location of these settlements is unknown with a few exceptions: Aesulae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Fidenae, Politorium, Bovillae, and Tolerium. It is possible that the Latinienses were settlers of the Ager Latiniensis, i. e. the area near Laurentum and Lavinium,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Cicero ''De Haruspicum Responso'': a crack sound was heard in the  Ager Latiniensis.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Foreti were actually settlers of the area later occupied by the Roman Forum. The Querquetulani, however, were certainly not the settlers of the Querquetulan (i.e. Caelian ) Hill in Rome as they are mentioned by Dionysius in the list of Latin peoples who went to war against Rome in 495.

====Dionysius's list====
Dionysius gives a list of the towns members  of the Latin League that voted for war against Rome after the capture of Fidenae by the Romans, under the influence of Aricia and of former king Tarquinius the Proud at an assembly held at Ferentinum:&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius V 61 3. D. calls ''Ferentinum'' the ''caput Ferentinae'' or ''aquae Ferentinae'' of Roman authors. See below A. Grandazzi's citations in the discussion of the issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ardea, Aricia, Bovillae, Bubentum, Cora, Carventum, Circei, Corioli, Corbio, Cabum, Fortinea,  Gabii, Laurentum, Lanuvium, Lavinium, Labici, Nomentum, Norba, Praeneste, Pedum, Querquetula, Satricum, Scaptia, Setia, Tibur, Tusculum, Tolerium, Tellenae, Velitrae."

As Niebuhr remarked, once again the total yields the sacred number of thirty, but the sum is made up of different components. It is a mix of some of the members of the ''populi Albenses'' and some of the ''clara oppida''. In fact, many of the ''oppida'' had been destroyed or resettled by the Romans during the regal period, namely Caenina, Politorium, Ficana, Cameria, Medullium, Corniculum, Collatia. Among the ''clara oppida'' of Pliny's list, Satricum, Norba, Sulmo, Scaptia, Tellenae show up here, and among the ''populi albenses'' Bubentum, Corioli, Pedum, Querquetula, Tolerium, and possibly Nomentum.

====Other sources====
In his description of Augustan region I, which included Old Latium, the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions many old towns, among them [[Collatia]], [[Antemnae]], [[Fidenae]] and [[Labicum]], as reduced to mere villages, private rural estates or displaced to different locations; [[Apiolae]], [[Suessa]] and [[Alba Longa]] as disappeared; [[Tellenae]] on the foothills southwest of the Alban Hills as still standing.

The historiographer Livy and the lexicographer [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] also repeatedly mention the old Latin towns.  Another tradition related by [[Philistos of Syracuse]] calls the Sicels Ligurians, whose king was a Sikelos. This tradition is followed by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], who cites [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]] as his authority.

These ancient traditions have led some scholars to look for traces of the presence of these peoples in later populations.

==Archaeological evidence==
Even though erudite scholars have been trying to ascertain the location of the ancient towns of Latium for at least the last four centuries (see Cluvier), and despite the recent progress made by archaeology in the field of the human settlement of ancient Latium, only a few towns of archaic Latium cited by ancient sources have been identified with certainty, whereas a remarkable number of settlements that have been unearthed remain unidentified. This is due to the lack of epigraphic confirmation, due to the rare use of writing in archaic times. The problem is made even more difficult because some of the ancient locations were possibly resettled during the [[Early Middle Ages]], as was probably the case for Labicum and Collatia. A good instance of such a custom is provided by Falerii outside Latium Vetus.  Towns which have been identified archaeologically include Satricum, Politorium, Ficana, Tellenae, Crustumerium, Corniculum, Antemnae, Collatia, Fidenae, Pedum,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Apiolae, Gabii and perhaps Querquetulum. [[Alba Longa]], Pometia and Corioli remain unidentified. Traces of the presence of the Ligures and Sicels remain in the [[toponymy]] and [[onomastics]].&lt;ref&gt;See the works by  G. Sergi, F. Ribezzo, G. Devoto, G. Alessio and A. Grandazzi cited below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conspicuous case and one which has given rise to long-standing debate is Alba Longa. The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by [[Ascanius]] and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is still a mystery. Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city. It would rather have been a loose collection of small and sparsely populated protohistoric villages organised in the Bronze Age custom around the sanctuary of Mount Albanus and abandoned before it reached the urban stage.&lt;ref&gt;A. Grandazzi "La localisation d' Alba" in  MEFRA 1986. See section below.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amitinum===
This centre was located to the east of Rome on the Corniculan Mountains, not far from Curniculum. Its identification is due to an inscription that mentions a ''pagus amentinus''.&lt;ref&gt;CIL VI 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antemnae===
The town of Antemnae was located three miles to the north of Rome on the left bank of the river Anio and close to its confluence with the Tiber. Its name means "between the rivers" (Antemnae is the Sabine for Latin ''interamnes''). Some of its ruins were discovered in 1880 during excavations to build the fortress "Forte Antenne". Later excavations yielded additional material. The location is now within the urban area of Rome.

Antemnae was colonised by Rome at the time of Romolus during the first effort to control the left bank of the Tiber up to the Anio, thus ensuring a communication  route with Etruria along the Via Salaria. The Antemnates and the Caeninenses were granted full Roman citizenship. Nevertheless, the town revolted several times, the last time in 507 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Hal. V 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apiolae===
Destroyed by [[Tarquinius Priscus]], the remains have been identified and excavated. The town was located on Monte Savello between [[Albano Laziale|Albano]] and [[Pavona]]. It housed a temple of Apollo and the famous spring of [[Juturna]], with nearby Lake Turni being the object of a local cult. Today the two water sources are known as the spring of Secciano and the Laghetto di Pavona.

===Aefulae===
The site of the settlement of the Alban people Aesulani has been identified with the hilltop castrum of Aefulae near ancient Tibur and close to the site of one of the temples of [[Bona Dea]]. It was deserted by the original dwellers and later resettled by the Romans, who turned it into a military fort.&lt;ref&gt;Aesulae is the Latin pronunciatiation of a Sabine Aefulae i.e. meaning Aedules.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bolae===
The site of the Alban people Bolani is frequently mentioned by the historians Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Livy. It was occupied by the Aequians probably already in the late 6th century or in the wars led by [[Coriolanus]].&lt;ref&gt;Dion. Hal. VIII 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Its site is not known with certainty, but it must have stood not far from Praeneste and Labicum.

===Corioli===
The site of this settlement must have stood on the south-west side of the Alban Hills near Genzano and Lanuvium.

===Pedum===
The most important of the Latin towns developed from the ancient ''populi albenses'', [[Pedum]] stood between Tibur and Praeneste near modern [[Gallicano nel Lazio]]. It was taken by the Romans with Coriolanus.&lt;ref&gt;Livy II 39; Plutarch ''Cor.'' 28.&lt;/ref&gt; After the final demise of the Latin League, the town declined.

===Tolerium===
This settlement of the Alban people was probably not far from Pedum, according to a passage in [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (7.26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438853 |title=Places: 438853 (Tolerium) |author=Purcell, N., R. Talbert, S. Gillies, T. Elliott, J. Becker |accessdate=October 24, 2015&lt;!-- 10:15 pm--&gt; |publisher=Pleiades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitellia===
The site of the populus of the Vitellienses was located at the border between the Latins and the Aequians.

===Caenina===
The site of [[Caenina]] has not yet been identified with certainty. It may have been located near present-day "La Rustica" close to the [[Aniene|Anio river]], on a trade route connecting Latium with Etruria and Campania.&lt;ref&gt;P. Zaccagni in ''Civiltá del Lazio primitivo. Catalogo della Mostra'' Roma 1976 p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Festus states it was close to the old Roman settlement. It was originally a settlement of the Sicels, as was Antemnae, who were later expelled by the Aborigenes.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' II 35, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dionysius records a tradition according to which Romulus was at Caenina for a sacrifice during the festival of the [[Lupercalia]], which was the occasion of the abduction of [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] by Numitor's shepherds.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius ''Roman Antiquities'' II 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The town underwent [[synoecism]] and some of its cults and  priests (''sacerdotes'') were transferred to Rome&lt;ref&gt;R. E. A. Palmer  ''The Archaic Community of the Romans'' Cambridge 1970 p. 106 n. 3; A. Alföldi  ''Early Rome and the Latins'' Ann Arbor 1965, p. 132; G. Wissowa  RE  1279.&lt;/ref&gt; by Romulus, who celebrated his first triumph after conquering the Caeninenses and killing their king, [[Acron]]. However, according to Dionysius, Romulus allowed the Caeninenses to continue to live in their hometown, although they had to accept a colony of three hundred Romans and the allotment to them of one third of their land.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus II 35, 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The town is still mentioned at the beginning of the Republic: the Vindicius who revealed the plot of the Aquilii to [[Publius Valerius Publicola]]  was a slave from Caenina captured in war.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Antiquities'' V 7, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The town name may be related to Latin ''caenum'' (mud, lime), itself a word with no Indoeuropean etymology.&lt;ref&gt;G. Alessio "Problemi storico-linguistici messapici" in ''Studi salentini'' 1962 '''14''' p. 318 n. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it was of Celtic (Ligurian) origin.

===Cameria or Camerium===
Since Romulus made this town into a Roman colony, it fought many wars against Rome. In 502 BC it was destroyed, and its ruins have not yet been found; it was located to the north-east of Rome.

===Collatia===
Strabo places [[Collatia]] some 30 [[stadia (length)|stades]] from Rome. Though by his time it had been reduced to farmland. The location of the site has not yet been identified with certainty, but it was located near modern [[Lunghezza]], to the east of Rome. Likely it stood on the hill now occupied by the [[Castello di Lunghezza]]; which lies at the terminus of the ancient [[Via Collatina]]. The town was conquered and colonized by the Romans. Livy preserves the formula of their surrender, often cited as example of the [[deditio in fide]].

Collatia was founded by the Latin king [[Alba Silvius|Silvius]] of Alba Longa and it was the hometown of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], one of the first two consuls of the Roman Republic.

===Curniculum or Corniculum===
The town has been located by modern scholars in the present position of [[Montecelio]] (formerly Monticelli) in the comune of [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]], not far from [[Tibur]]. The two adjacent hills shaped like a pair of horns were the source of its name, and the nearby mountain range is still known as "Monti Cornicolani". 

Near Montecelio, relics dating from the [[Iron Age]] and fragments of pottery from the 7th-6th centuries BC have been discovered. The town was destroyed by Tarquinius Priscus&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 38; 39. Dionysius III 50; IV 1. Ovid  Fasti VI 627 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and was believed to be the hometown of [[Servius Tullius]]'s mother, Ocresia.

===Crustumerium or Crustumeria===
The site of [[Crustumerium]] has been known since the 19th century. It is located in the hills of the Riserva Naturale park of Marcigliana Vecchia, to the north of Rome near Settebagni, on the [[Via Salaria]]. The town was also known as ''Castrimoenium'' and ''Crustumeria'' and has given its name to the surrounding countryside and hills known as "Ager Crustuminus" and "Montes Crustumini". According to Servius it was originally a settlement of the [[Sicels]],  founded by the Sicel Clitemnestrus.&lt;ref&gt;Servius Danielis "ad Aeneidem" VII 631 = Cassius Hemina fragm. 2 Peter.&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the name is unclear and may reflect an ancient Pre-Indo European toponymic ''crustulum'', meaning pond.&lt;ref&gt;Costanzo Garancini&lt;/ref&gt;

Crustumerium has been and is still being excavated by archaeologists and its study has been important for understanding urban development in Old Latium. It was located on one of the routes that linked [[Veii]] and [[Gabii]], close to a ford on the Tiber, which fact, along with the richness of its countryside, was the cause of its importance and wealth.&lt;ref name="QuiliciGigli1980"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lorenzo Quilici|author2=Stefania Quilici Gigli|title=Crustumerium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JREvAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche, Centro di studio per l'archeologia etrusco-italica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town stretched along a road trench and occupied an area of 60 hectares. It had walls that were a complex made by four or five parallel stretches connected by normal ones and covered with stone slabs. Tombs contained a rich production of fine pottery painted in white and red, weapons, and other instruments from the early Iron Age onward. 

The town is mentioned in the Aeneid, and in the history of Rome it was involved in the abduction of the Sabine women and the subsequent war. Further, Romulus is said to have installed a colony of Romans there. Later it is frequently mentioned in the wars between Rome and its neighbors. 

Literary sources put the destruction of Crustumerium at the end of the sixth century,&lt;ref&gt;Livy II 19.&lt;/ref&gt; but archaeologists have shown it was still occupied in the fifth century and declined only in the fourth century.&lt;ref&gt;A. Amoroso "Crustumerium: a frontier settlement" in ''Bollettino di Archeologia'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ficana===
[[Ficana]] was located  on the left bank of the Tiber, downstream from Rome, near present-day [[Acilia]] on the highland over Monte Cugno. In ancient times, this provided an advantage as it was steeper and a dominant position on the river. Its identification is confirmed by the find of an inscription. The sources state that it was destroyed twice by Ancus Marcius in his drive to control the lower course of the Tiber and the salines, together with Politorium and Tellenae. Its importance was owed to the fact it was a port that afforded a commercial route to the hinterland toward the Alban Hills and Aricia.

Archaeologists have shown that it was still a prosperous centre during the 4th century and reached its maximum expansion after the Roman conquest. It declined only in the 4th and 3rd centuries after the development of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]. Excavations have unearthed the town wall, housing areas and a necropolis. Long-necked [[amphora]]s  decorated with reliefs or scratches of a style typical of 7th-century Old Latium testify to the early quality of the local material culture. The Ficana site is now an archaeological park.{{When|date=July 2017}}

===Medullium===
Also known in the sources as [[Medullia]], its exact location is unknown. It was the hometown of [[Hostus Hostilius]]'s family and was conquered by Tullus Hostilius, although not destroyed. Its name suggests a relationship to the Ligurian tribe of the Medulli (Medylloi in Strabon IV 1, 11) and would appear to be cognate with the Celtic deity Meduna.&lt;ref&gt;G. Alessio "Genti e favelle dell'antica Apulia" Cressati Taranto 1949 p. 17 n. 3 (= ''Archivio Storico Pugliese''  II 1949) citing Holder ''Altceltische Sprache'' II col. 528: cfr. German ''Met''.&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo&lt;ref&gt;IV 6.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions two other towns named Medullia, one on the western alps in Gallia and one on the eastern alps in Iapudia.

===Politorium===
[[Politorium]] has been identified in the archaic settlement found near [[Castel di Decima]], south-east of Rome, but this identification lacks epigraphic confirmation. It is mentioned by Cato, who records its founding, and by Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassos, who describe its capture and successive demolition by Ancus Marcius. Its inhabitants would have been deported to the Aventine. These facts are part of the first expansive drive by Rome toward the sea, which also brought about the fall of Ficana and Tellenae.

The excavations have uncovered remains of the fortifications and a princely necropolis.

===Satricum===
[[Satricum]] was recorded by Pliny as the first in his list of ''clara oppida''. It was an important and ancient settlement of the Latin and other tribes and arose near the prehistoric sanctuary of [[Mater Matuta]]. It has been identified by archaeologists at Le Ferriere, in the present [[Province of Latina]], and it was systematically excavated by the Royal Dutch Institute in Rome in collaboration with Italian authorities. During excavations in 1977 the inscription known as [[Lapis Satricanus]] was unearthed.&lt;ref name="Stibbe1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. M. Stibbe|title=Lapis Satricanus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvseAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Ministerie van Cultuur, Recreatie en Maatschappelijk Werk|isbn=978-90-12-02951-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scaptia===
The town is mentioned by Livy&lt;ref&gt;Livy AUC VIII 17.&lt;/ref&gt; as the eponymous settlement of the Roman tribe of the same name. Its location has not been identified, with some scholars suggesting that it was located near Tibur or near Passerano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/438829 |title=Places: 438829 (Scaptia) |author=Purcell, N., R. Talbert, S. Gillies, T. Elliott, J. Becker |accessdate=October 24, 2015&lt;!-- 10:02 pm--&gt; |publisher=Pleiades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern studies on the settlement of prehistoric Latium==

===Linguistic comparisons===
[[Wolfgang Helbig]] was the first to remark that the name of Alba Longa and of many other Ligurian settlements, such as ''Albieis'' north of Massalia, with their centre [[Alba Augusta]], as well as Albium (Albion) Intemelium (now [[Ventimiglia]]), Albium (Albion) Ingaunum (now [[Albenga]]) and [[Alba Pompeia]] in Italy, could hardly mean "white", from the Latin adjective ''albus'' , since the rocks in the area of volcanic Mount Albanus are deep grey in colour.&lt;ref&gt;W. Helbig ''Die Italiker in der Poebene'' 1879.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giuseppe Sergi]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Sergi ''Da Albalonga a Roma. Inizio dell'incivilimento in Italia, ovvero Liguri e Siculi'' Turin 1934 p. 3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; remarked that the early name of the Tiber was Albula, a name that recurs elsewhere in [[hydronymy]] where there are traces of Ligurians and Sicels.&lt;ref&gt;The Albula, a source near Tibur. The Albula oracle in Virgil's Aeneis. An Albula river in Picenum near Numana, town that Pliny NH III 13 ascribes to the Sicels; another one in the Lepontine Alps; one in the Grisons canton of present day Switzerland. The Albinia river in Etruria (now [[Albegna]]), a river Alba in Sicily and another one in Northeast Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence connecting Ligures and Siculi was provided by a neolithic skeleton unearthed at Sgurgola near [[Anagni]] that was painted red, as were the ones found in the Ligurian cave of the "[[Arene Candide]]". Sergi concluded that Ligures and Siceli were in fact just one [[ethnic group]], but since they lived far apart, they had come to be considered as two distinct nations. Their identity could be confirmed by ancient [[toponymy|toponyms]] found in Latium as well as other regions of Italy. Strabon also mentions that a former name for the Alps was Albia.

Other correspondences include the ancient name of the [[Lake of Bracciano]], ''Sabatinus Lacus'' and the town of Sabate on its shores, and the river Sāpis in Umbria, names based on a [[Pre-Indo-European languages|Pre-Indo-European]] root *sāb- meaning water, seen also in the name [[Vada Sabatia]] (today [[Vado Ligure]]).&lt;ref&gt;C. Battisti ''Sostrati e parastrati'' Florence 1959 p. 125 ff. ; A. Trombetti ''Studi Etruschi'' XIV 1940 p. 187;  G. Devoto ''Gli antichi Italici'' Rome 1969 p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
The land of Old Latium was mostly fertile, and agriculture was practiced in the lowlands since an early time. In the lowlands, cereals and legumes were grown. In the hills, grapes were planted, and the wines such as Setinus, Albanus, and Signinus, were of good quality.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo V 3, 2; V 3, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the highlands, animal husbandry took the place of food production as an economic force.     

[[Gabii]] had famous quarries of red [[travertine]] stone, which was used as building material in the surrounding area, Rome included.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo V 3, 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Crafts, such as smithing and pottery, were also developed. 

Diseases like [[malaria]] were restricted to coastal areas and a few other locations.

'''Oronce Finé''' (or '''Fine''';&lt;ref&gt;For the debate over the French spelling of Finé's name see Alexander Marr, 'Introduction', in 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 1–12. Finé's name is often found spelt with an acute accent, but the ''Dictionnaire de Biographie française'' (ed. Roman D'Amat, Paris, 1975, p.1370) gives a very definite direction that his name should be spelt without an accent, "Fine, et non Finé".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]]: ''Orontius Finnaeus'' or ''Finaeus''; {{lang-it|Oronzio Fineo}}; 20 December 1494 – 8 August 1555) was a French mathematician and [[cartographer]].

==Life==
Born in [[Briançon]], the son and grandson of physicians, he was educated in Paris ([[Collège de Navarre]]) and obtained a degree in medicine in 1522. 

He was imprisoned in 1524, probably for practicing [[judicial astrology]].

In 1531, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Collège Royal (the present [[Collège de France]]), founded by [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]], where he taught until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Pantin, 'Oronce Fine's Role as Royal Lecturer', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 13–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apprendre-math.info/history/photos/Fine.jpeg]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
[[File:Finé, Oronce – Quadratura circuli, 1544 – BEIC 99133.jpg|thumb|''Quadratura circuli'', 1544]]

Although primarily a populariser, Finé was one of the most prolific authors of mathematical books of his age. He worked in a wide range of mathematical fields, including practical geometry, arithmetic, optics, gnomonics, astronomy and instrumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Marr, 'Introduction', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave the value of [[pi]] (≈&amp;nbsp;3.14159) to be {{sfrac|{{frac|22|2|9}}|7}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3.1746 in 1544. Later, he gave {{sfrac|47|15}}&amp;nbsp;≈ &amp;nbsp;3.1333 and, in ''De rebus mathematicis'' (1556), he gave {{sfrac|3|11|78}}&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3.1410.

==Astronomy and geography==
In 1542 Finé published ''De mundi sphaera'' (''On the Heavenly Spheres''), a popular astronomy textbook whose [[woodcut]] illustrations were much appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Mosley, 'Early Modern Cosmography: Fine's ''Sphaera mundi'' in Content and Context', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 114–136.&lt;/ref&gt; His writing on astronomy included guides to the use of astronomical equipment and methods (e.g. the ancient practice of determining [[longitude]] through the coordinated observation of lunar [[eclipse]]s from two fixed points with enough distance between them to make the phenomena appear at different times of the night). He also described more recent innovations, such as an instrument he called a ''méthéoroscope'' (an [[astrolabe]] modified by adding a [[compass]]).

Explanatory work was complemented by direct contributions. His woodcut map of France (1525) is one of the first of its kind. He constructed an [[ivory]] [[sundial]] in 1524, which still exists.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Eagleton, 'Oronce Fine's Sundials: The Sources and Influences of De solaribus horologiis', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 83–99&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map-heart-054.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Heart-shaped map]]

Finé's heart-shaped (cordiform) [[map projection]] may be his most famous illustration, and was frequently employed by other notable cartographers, including [[Peter Apian]] and [[Gerardus Mercator]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Brioist, 'Oronce Fine and Cartographical Methods', in Alexander Marr (ed.), 'The Worlds of Oronce Fine: Mathematics, Instruments and Print in Renaissance France' (Shaun Tyas, 2009), pp. 137–155.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Finé attempted to reconcile discoveries in the [[New World]] with old medieval legends and information (derived from [[Ptolemy]]) regarding the Orient. Thus, on one of his two world maps, ''Nova Universi Orbis Descriptio'' (1531), the legend marked ''Asia'' covers both North America and Asia, which were represented as one landmass. He used the [[toponymy|toponym]] "America" for South America, and thus [[Marco Polo]]'s ''[[Names of China#Mangi|Mangi]]'', ''[[Tangut people|Tangut]]'' and ''[[Cathay|Catay]]'' appear on the shores of the present-day [[Gulf of Mexico]]. On the same map, Finé drew ''[[Terra Australis]]'' to the south, including the legend "recently discovered but not yet completely explored", by which he meant the discovery of [[Tierra del Fuego]] by [[Ferdinand Magellan]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "Terra Australis Not Yet Known", National Library of Australia, ''Mapping our World: Terra Incognita to Australia'', Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2013, p. 82. [http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/search~S2?/XNova%20et&amp;SORT=D/XNova%20et&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=Nova%20et/1,280,280,E/l856~b2431215&amp;FF=XNova%20et&amp;SORT=D&amp;15,15,,1,0&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Image at ''Rare Maps from the State Library of New South Wales'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Finé's cosmography was derived from the German mathematician and cosmographer [[Johannes Schöner]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Harrisse, ''The Discovery of North America'', London, 1892 (reprinted Amsterdam, N. Israel, 1961), p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt; In his study of Schöner's globes, Franz von Wieser, found that the derivation of Finé's ''mappemonde'' from them was "unmistakeable (''unverkennbar'')"; he said "Orontius Finaeus took from Schöner not only the 'Brasilie Regio'", but the whole Austral Continent, the Strait of Magellan, and above all the whole arrangement of lands; in a word, the ''mappemonde'' of Oronce Finé is a copy of Schöner's".&lt;ref&gt;Franz von Wieser, ''Magalhães-Strasse und Austral-Continent. Auf den Globen Johannes Schöner. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Erdkunde im xvi. Jahrhundert'', Innsbruck, 1881 (reprinted Amsterdam, Meridian, 1967), pp. 67, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucien Gallois also noted the undeniable ''ressemblance parfaite'' between Finé's 1531 ''mappemonde'' and Schöner's globe of 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Gallois, ''Les Géographes allemands de la Renaissance'', Paris, Leroux, 1890 (repr. Amsterdam, Meridian, 1963), p. 92.[https://archive.org/details/lesgographesall00gallgoog]&lt;/ref&gt; As Schöner's globe of 1523, which also closely resembled Finé's ''mappemonde'', was not identified until 1925 by Frederik (F.C.) Wieder, Gallois was forced to argue that Finé, who said he had been working on his ''mappemonde'' since 1521, had had direct or indirect personal communication with Schöner or had drawn upon his 1515 ''Luculentissima descriptio''. Wieder's identification of Schöner's map gores of 1523 strengthens Gallois' case for Finé's reliance upon Schöner.&lt;ref&gt;F. C. Wieder (ed.), ''Monumenta Cartographica'', The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1925, Vol. I, pp. 1–4, "The Globe of Johannes Schöner, 1523–1524", and Plates 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine's 1536 world map bore a dedicatory inscription in the lower left corner, which stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt; ABOUT FIFTEEN years since, Dear Reader, we first designed, in the shape of a human heart, this universal map of the world, in gratitude to the Most Christian and Most Mighty Francis, King of the French, our most clement Maecenas. For while we saw the King, a Polymath, and uncommon Geographer, greatly pleased by all and praised by many, even in foreign countries, I wanted finally to communicate the same description of the whole globe to all students of Mathematics: which, after variations in fortune and crises in the studies we pursued, which up to now have been a hindrance to us, we have finally done at our own risk. And so, augmented and corrected by many observations of modern hydrographers, the same heart-shaped geographical image for yourself, devoted reader and for all men of goodwill, we present to a wise and liberal mind. It remains, therefore, that you will not refuse to accept this labour and industry of ours with a human appearance, and fairly and well consult it. Finally, while we strive ever more earnestly for the favour and generosity of our Most Christian and magnificent King, whose happiness and success you eagerly desire, we have shared this with you. Farewell, from Paris.&lt;ref&gt;DECIMVSQVINTVS CIRCITER agitur annus, candide Lector, quo universam Orbis terrarum designationem, in hanc humani cordis effigiem primum redegimus: Idque in gratiam Christianissimi ac potentissimi FRANCISCI Francorum Regis, Mœcenatis nostri clementissimi. Quam dum videremus ipsi Regi, Polyhistori, ac non vulgari Geographo, valde placere ab omnibus quoque (etiam exteris) laudari plurimum: desiderabam eandem orbis descriptionem, universis Mathematicarum studiosis aliquando communicare. Quod post varia fortunae, ac studii nostri (quae hactenus nobis impedimento fuere) discrimina, tandem nostro effecimus periculo. Itaque plurimis recentiorum hydrographorum observationibus auctam, et emendatam ipsius geographici cordis imaginem, tibi studiose lector, cunctisque bonae voluntatis hominibus, cordato ac liberali praesentamus animo. Reliquum est igitur ut hunc laborem nostrum et industriam, humano vultu non graveris accipere, et aequi bonique consulas. Ipsi demum Christianissimo, ac magnifico Regi nostro, prosperam exoptes foelicitatem, cuius favore atque munificentia, haec (interea dum molimur graviora) tibi communicavimus. Vale, Luteciae Parisiorum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Finé died in Paris at age 60.

[[Jean Clouet]] is said to have painted a portrait of Finé in 1530, when Finé was 36. With the original painting lost, the rendering is now known only through prints derived from the original image.

==Honours==
The [[lunar crater]] [[Orontius (crater)|Orontius]] and [[Finaeus Cove]] in [[Antarctica]] are named after Oronce Finé, using his Latinized name.
In 2014, a square named after Oronce Fine was inaugurated in Paris, France.

&lt;!--... Attention:  THIS IS AN OUTLINE

        part of the set of 740+ outlines listed at
             [[Portal:Contents/Outlines]].

                 Wikipedia outlines are
              a special type of list article.
              They make up one of Wikipedia's
                content navigation systems

                See [[Wikipedia:Outlines]]
                      for more details.
                   Further improvements
              to this outline are on the way
...--&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to geology:

'''[[Geology]]''' – one of the [[Earth science]]s – is the study of the Earth, with the general exclusion of present-day life, flow within the ocean, and the atmosphere. The field of geology encompasses the composition, structure, physical properties, and history of Earth's components, and the processes by which they are shaped. Geologists typically study [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[sediment]], [[soil]], [[river]]s, and [[natural resource]]s.

[[File:Radar screen.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Radar ranges and bearings can be very useful for navigation.]]Marine and aviation radar systems can provide very useful navigation information in a variety of situations.  When a vessel is within radar range of land or special [[Corner reflector|radar aids to navigation]], the navigator can take distances and angular bearings to charted objects and use these to establish arcs of position and lines of position on a chart.&lt;ref name="chap744"&gt;Maloney, 2003:744.&lt;/ref&gt;  A fix consisting of only radar information is called a radar fix.&lt;ref name="bow816"&gt;Bowditch, 2002:816.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of radar fixes include the relatively self-explanatory methods of "range and bearing to a single object,"&lt;ref name="nima163"&gt;National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:163.&lt;/ref&gt;  "two or more bearings,"&lt;ref name="nima163"/&gt; "tangent bearings,"&lt;ref name="nima163"/&gt; and "two or more ranges."&lt;ref name="nima163"/&gt;

Parallel indexing is a technique defined by William Burger in the 1957 book ''The Radar Observer's Handbook''.&lt;ref  name="nima169"&gt;National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:169.&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique involves creating a line on the screen that is parallel to the ship's course, but offset to the left or right by some distance.&lt;ref  name="nima169"/&gt;  This parallel line allows the navigator to maintain a given distance away from hazards.&lt;ref  name="nima169"/&gt;

Some techniques have been developed for special situations.  One, known as the "contour method," involves marking a transparent plastic template on the radar screen and moving it to the chart to fix a position.&lt;ref  name="nima164"&gt;National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another special technique, known as the Franklin Continuous Radar Plot Technique, involves drawing the path a radar object should follow on the radar display if the ship stays on its planned course.&lt;ref  name="nima182"&gt;National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:182.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the transit, the navigator can check that the ship is on track by checking that the pip lies on the drawn line.&lt;ref  name="nima182"/&gt;

After completing the plotting radar technique, the image from the radar can either be displayed, captured or recorded to a computer monitor using a [[frame grabber]].

During the Mauritanian occupation of [[Western Sahara]] (1975–79), its portion of the territory (roughly corresponding to the lower half of [[Río de Oro]] province) was named [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya]].

The regions are subdivided into 44 departments; see [[departments of Mauritania]] for more information.

'''Tadla''' is a historical and geographical region of [[Morocco]], located in the center of the country, north of the [[High Atlas]] and west of the [[Middle Atlas]]. It is the region of origin of the eponymous tribal, semi-nomadic pastoralist population, the « Tadla tribes ».

Nowadays, the historical region of Tadla is mainly part of the administrative region of [[Béni Mellal-Khénifra]], except the historical territory of the Beni Meskine tribe, which is part of the [[Casablanca-Settat]] administrative region.
