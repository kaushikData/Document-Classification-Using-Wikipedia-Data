'''Ajamu S. Baraka''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|ʒ|ɑː|m|uː|_|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|k|ə}} {{respell|ə|ZHAH|moo|_|bə|RAH|kə}}; born October 25, 1953)&lt;ref name="Quanki"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ajamu S Baraka|url=http://quanki.com/person.php?person=06ESTHVAB98|website=Quanki|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American political activist and former [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].

== Early life ==
{{Missing information|high school and university attended|date=September 2016}}
Baraka was born in 1953 and grew up on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="commondreams"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amnesty International Death Penalty Opponent to Receive Abolitionist of the Year Award |url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/1019-01.htm |website=[[Common Dreams]] |accessdate=August 1, 2016 |date=October 19, 2001 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122065840/http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/1019-01.htm |archivedate=November 22, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the U.S. Army in the [[Vietnam War]]. Upon discharge, he moved to the [[southern United States]], where he became involved in anti-segregation activism.&lt;ref name="democracynow"&gt;{{cite web|title= Meet Ajamu Baraka: Green VP Candidate Aims to Continue the Legacy of W.E.B. Du Bois &amp; Malcolm X |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/18/meet_ajamu_baraka_green_vp_candidate|website=[[Democracy Now!]]|accessdate=August 19, 2016|date=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraka received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in international studies and political science from the [[University of South Florida|University of South Florida, Tampa]] in 1982 and his [[Master of Arts|MA]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in political science from [[Clark Atlanta University]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elections.alaska.gov/election/2016/Primary/CandidateOEP/23240407.pdf Alaska Division of Elections – Green Primary Candidates]&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka has noted the importance of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] in the formation of his black internationalist worldview, and he attended Clark Atlanta, where Du Bois had taught. Baraka also became involved in the Central America solidarity movement, organizing delegations to [[Nicaragua]] in support of the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. He then became an [[Amnesty International]] volunteer, eventually moving up to the board of the organization.&lt;ref name="democracynow" /&gt;

== Career ==
From 2004 to 2011, Baraka served as the founding executive director of the [[US Human Rights Network]], a national network that grew to over 300 U.S.-based organizations and 1500 individual members. He is currently an associate fellow at the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ajamu Baraka|url=http://www.ips-dc.org/authors/ajamu-baraka/|website=Institute for Policy Studies|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraka has served on the boards of several human rights organizations, including [[Amnesty International]], the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]], and [[Africa Action]].&lt;ref name="woodhull" /&gt;

== Activism ==
[[File:2011 Vicki Sexual Freedom Award recipients.jpg|thumb|left|Baraka (left) with other recipients of the [[Woodhull Sexual Freedom Alliance|Vicki Sexual Freedom Award]], 2011]]
In 2008, Baraka worked with the US Human Rights Network and over 400 organizations to develop a CERD Shadow Report, which concerned US compliance with the terms of the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]. They felt the US government's reports did not adequately address [[racial profiling]], displacement from Hurricane Katrina, and land rights for the [[Western Shoshone]], among other issues. A large delegation presented their findings.&lt;ref name="yesmag"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawkins|first1=Tanya|title=Human Rights in the Age of Obama|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/peace-justice/human-rights-in-the-age-of-obama|website=[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|YES! Magazine]]|accessdate=August 1, 2016|date=December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, a [[Morton County, North Dakota]] judge issued an [[arrest warrant]] against Baraka and [[Jill Stein]], after the two were charged with [[misdemeanor]] criminal trespassing and [[criminal mischief]] in connection with their protest against the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]].&lt;ref name="warrant1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Arrest warrants issued for Jill Stein, running mate after N.D. protest |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/09/07/arrest-warrants-stein-green-party/89965374/ |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="warrant2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Party's Jill Stein Charged in N.

==Views and writings ==
Writings by Baraka have appeared in ''Black Agenda Report'', ''[[Common Dreams]]'', ''Dissident Voice'', ''[[Pambazuka News]]'', ''[[CounterPunch]]'', and other media outlets.&lt;ref name="articles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles--Ajamu Baraka|url=http://www.ajamubaraka.com/articles|website=A Voice from the Margins|publisher=Baraka|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Hooks wrote in ''[[Politico Magazine]]'' that Baraka "has a long history of fringe statements and beliefs."&lt;ref name="Hooks"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Christopher|last=Hooks|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/what-if-the-green-party-stopped-being-kooky-and-started-getting-real-214149|title= What If the Green Party Stopped Being Kooky and Started Getting Real?|website=Politico|date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic policy ===

==== Death penalty ====
Baraka was critical of [[United States President]] [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] decision in 2000 to place a moratorium of [[death sentence]]s for the remainder of his term. Baraka stated, "This was a cynical attempt by the president to shift the responsibility for this execution onto the next president [...] Regardless of how they try to spin it, claims by President Clinton and Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] that they are concerned about racial and geographic disparities ring hollow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sniffen|first1=Michael J.|title=Clinton praised for death-penalty reprieve|work=Daily Breeze|date=December 9, 2000|location=Torrance, California|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 2001 an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The Daily Oklahoman]]'' authored by Baraka laid out his opposition to the death penalty and the sentencing of [[Timothy McVeigh]] to death for his part in the [[1995 Oklahoma City bombing]]. He wrote, "[Amnesty International] has dedicated 40 years to working with and on behalf of victims on a daily basis, we have the utmost respect and sympathy for the suffering of the families and loved ones of victims of violence—suffering that deserves compassion, respect and justice. [...] However, the killing of McVeigh, like all other executions, will be done for reasons of political expediency and retribution rather than reasons of justice. For while family members of victims are entitled to respect and compassion, courts should not be allowed to become forums for retaliation. This degrades not only our system of justice but also ourselves as human beings, as we then become little better than the killers we seek to condemn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|title=Death penalty cruel, outdated|work=The Oklahoman|date=May 2, 2001|location=Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|page=9-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Disaster relief ====
In 2005, Baraka argued that the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]] should be considered "[[internally displaced]]" and given assistance in accordance with internationally recognized rights for such people.&lt;ref name="newwave"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on Katrina and Human Rights Issues|url=http://www2.tulane.edu/news/newwave/101606_spotlight_on_katrina_and_human_rights_issues.cfm|website=New Wave|publisher=[[Tulane University]]|accessdate=August 1, 2016|date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraka criticized the U.S. government for its reaction to the [[2016 Louisiana floods]], comparing its "unprepared" response to "the callous response of the Bush administration" after Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|title=Crucial Context: The Floods in Louisiana|url=http://www.ajamubaraka.com/blog/2016/8/20/crucial-context-the-floods-in-louisiana|accessdate=September 25, 2016|date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that natural disasters and environmental hazards have a disproportionate impact on minority and low-income communities, Baraka wrote that "the flood victims in Louisiana deserve real justice that addresses the full spectrum of human rights," including better temporary housing and fair distribution of and access to humanitarian aid.&lt;ref name="flood" /&gt;

==== Drug policy ====
Baraka has opposed the [[War on Drugs]], which he believes has caused local police departments to be "militarized" and "unleashed" on minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|title=From anti-war to anti-imperialism|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/governance/anti-war-anti-imperialism|accessdate=September 25, 2016|date=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Baraka said he was in favor of granting clemency to individuals convicted of marijuana-related offenses, calling prison sentences for nonviolent drug convictions "a waste of taxpayers' money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|title=Community Forum 8/19: Answers to your Facebook Questions |url=http://www.ajamubaraka.com/blog/2016/8/20/community-forum-819-answers-to-your-facebook-questions|accessdate=September 25, 2016|date=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Race relations ====
Baraka has criticized efforts to "Americanize" black radicals and to assimilate African Americans into the American middle class, writing: "Saner people would call that process genocide, but in the U.S. it is called racial progress."&lt;ref name="beyonce" /&gt; Referencing [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] activist [[Assata Shakur]], Baraka argued that black radical activists could never obtain true freedom "while the American government and American capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/16/the-yemen-tragedy-and-the-ongoing-crisis-of-the-left-in-the-united-states/  The Yemen Tragedy and the Ongoing Crisis of the Left in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; remain intact."&lt;ref name="beyonce" /&gt;

In September 2016, Baraka called for an international commission to monitor [[police brutality in the United States]], calling recent killings by police a form of "state-sponsored violence against civilians".&lt;ref name="bodycount"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|title=The Body Count Rises: A Call for International Oversight of U.S. Police Killings |url=http://www.ajamubaraka.com/blog/2016/9/23/the-body-count-rises-a-call-for-international-oversight-of-us-police-killings|accessdate=September 25, 2016|date=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka wrote that the United States was "in the midst of a human rights crisis, and the Obama administration has been unable to make black lives matter to representatives of the state."&lt;ref name="bodycount" /&gt;

==== Prison abolition ====
Baraka is in favor of [[prison abolition movement|abolishing prisons]], believing that "we can build a society where prisons are not necessary and [[restorative justice]] can be a tool we use as we evolve as human beings."&lt;ref name="prison"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|title=Who Should be in Prison? |url=http://www.ajamubaraka.com/blog/2016/8/25/who-should-be-in-prison|accessdate=September 25, 2016|date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While recognizing that those who are "imminently harmful" to other people may need to be separated from society, Baraka disagrees with "the barbaric practice of confining people to cells as though they were animals for years at a time."&lt;ref name="prison" /&gt;

==== Free trade ====
Baraka condemns the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP), and other [[free trade agreement]]s that he characterizes as "[[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]]."&lt;ref name="stopTPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/05/12/stopping-the-trans-pacific-partnership-is-a-black-issue/|title=Stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a "Black Issue"|last=Baraka|first=Ajamu|newspaper=CounterPunch|date= May 22, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neoliberal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/05/21/black-america-and-the-political-economy-of-neoliberal-trade-deals/|title=Black America and the Political Economy of Neoliberal Trade Deals|last=Baraka|first=Ajamu|newspaper=CounterPunch|date=May 21, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraka has termed trade deals a "Black issue" both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref name="stopTPP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neoliberal"/&gt; He asserts that the TPP "is a weapon to maintain U.S. global hegemony by denying the fundamental economic, social and cultural rights of millions of people in order to benefit a parasitic white minority ruling class in the U.S."&lt;ref name="stopTPP" /&gt;  He has stated that poverty and disruption of black communities in many US cities and among peoples in [[Latin America]] are the result of NAFTA.&lt;ref name="stopTPP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neoliberal"/&gt;

=== Foreign policy ===
[[File:Ajamu-Baraka.jpg|thumb|Ajamu Baraka]]

Baraka has been critical of the current [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy,&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/ajamubaraka/status/783499498907729920&lt;/ref&gt; especially intervening for humanitarian reasons.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.commondreams.org/views/2013/06/04/syria-and-sham-humanitarian-intervention&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
Baraka has been a vehement [[Criticism of Israel|critic of Israel]]. In October 2014, Baraka traveled to the [[Palestinian territories]] as part of an 18-member "African Heritage delegation" organized by the Interfaith Peace-Builders group. The delegation issued six "findings and demands" and urged the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] to place pressure on Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Heritage delegation backs global resistance to Israel's "21st century colonialism"|url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/african-heritage-delegation-backs-global-resistance-israels-21st-century|website=Electronic Intifada|accessdate=August 11, 2016|date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group specifically called the expansion of [[Israeli settlement]]s "ethnic cleansing and 21st century colonialism"; called for an end to [[United States foreign aid|U.S. aid]] to Israel; [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|accused Israel of apartheid]]; and praised the "[[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]]" movement as "an essential tool in the struggle for Palestinian liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of the 2014 African Heritage Delegation|url=http://www.ifpb.org/africanheritage/statement.html |publisher=Interfaith Peace Builders|accessdate=August 11, 2016|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making the visit, Baraka wrote that "a negotiated, relatively 'peaceful' resolution of [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|the conflict]] is impossible" because "the Israeli state has no interest in a negotiated settlement with Palestinians."&lt;ref name="palestine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/11/19/violence-and-resistance-in-palestine/|last=Baraka|first=Ajamu|title=Violence and Resistance in Palestine|date=November 19, 2014|website=[[CounterPunch]]|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accused Israel of carrying out what he termed a "brutal occupation and illegal theft of Palestinian land," adding:

{{quote|text=During my activist life I have traveled to many of the countries that Western colonial/capitalist leaders characterized as despotic totalitarian states – the old Soviet Union, North Korea, Cuba before 1989 – but in none of those states did I witness the systematic mechanism of population control and scientific repression that I witness in "democratic" Israel. The security walls, towers, checkpoints, and armed settlers created an aura of insecurity and impending assault on one's dignity at any time. I left that space wondering how anyone with a modicum of humanity and any sense of morality could reconcile living in that environment from the spoils of Palestinian dispossession and degradation and how any nation could support the Israeli political project.&lt;ref name="palestine" /&gt;}}

Baraka also questioned news stories about the [[2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers|June 2014 kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers]], which Israel blamed on [[Hamas]] members and which led to Israeli air strikes in the [[Gaza Strip]] against Hamas. One month after the kidnappings, which he called a "false flag operation," Baraka indicated in an interview his belief that "the kids were supposed to be kidnapped but they weren't supposed to be murdered. That was an accident. But nevertheless it gave Israel the pretext that they were setting up for, and that was the opportunity to basically attack Hamas in order to destroy the [[Palestinian Unity Government of June 2014|unity government]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://noliesradio.org/archives/85748 |title=Sander Hicks, Jim Fetzer, Ajamu Baraka — on Kevin Barrett's Truth Jihad Radio |website=No Lies Radio |host=Kevin Barrett |date=July 19, 2014 |time=1:22:12 |access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two suspects, both members of Hamas, were killed in a shootout with Israeli forces in September 2014, while a third Hamas member was convicted of the murders in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4574284,00.html|title=Inside the raid on teens' killers|publisher=Ynet News|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-30697521|title=Palestinian jailed for murder of Israeli teenagers|author=BBC|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Baraka condemned Israeli prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s comments on the day of the [[Israeli legislative election, 2015|2015 Israeli elections]]. Netanyahu had warned supporters in a video posted to his [[Facebook]] page that his government was in danger because "Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/benjamin-netanyahu-arab-voter-turnout-116142 |title=Netanyahu: 'Arab voters are coming out in droves' |last=Gass |first=Nick |date=March 17, 2015 |website=Politico |access-date=August 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka called Netanyahu's words a "racist rant" that exposed "the brutal and immoral reality of the Israeli colonial project" and the "illusion" of a [[two-state solution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/03/26/netanyahus-victory-is-an-even-bigger-victory-for-palestinian-solidarity-movement/ |last=Baraka|first=Ajamu|title=Netanyahu’s Victory is an Even Bigger Victory for Palestinian Solidarity Movement|date=March 26, 2014 |website=[[CounterPunch]]|access-date=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Syria and Iraq ====
Speaking in 2014 on [[Iraq War|U.S. involvement in Iraq]], Baraka characterized U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East over the previous 20 years as "disastrous" and said that "what has occurred in Iraq was predictable."&lt;ref name="cbspgh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Chris|title=Ajamu Baraka Discusses American Involvement In Iraq|url=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2014/06/15/ajamu-baraka-discusses-american-involvement-in-iraq/|publisher=[[CBS Pittsburgh]]|accessdate=August 1, 2016|date=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview, Baraka stated his belief that the U.S. had a part in creating the “boogeyman” of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] “to basically garner significant public support for an argument that says that this monster, these evil forces—that, by the way, we helped to create—we are the only ones that can go in and slay this monster.”&lt;ref name="Gawker" /&gt; Baraka has also asserted that the [[Human rights violations during the Syrian Civil War|atrocities of the Syrian Civil War]] are being "fomented by a demented and dying U.S. empire, with the assistance of the royalist monarchies of the Middle East and the gangster states of NATO."&lt;ref name="BarakaSyriaJune2014" /&gt; In an interview, he has suggested that control of natural resources, such as the proposed [[Qatar-Turkey pipeline|Qatar-Turkey]] and [[Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline|Iran-Iraq-Syria]] [[natural gas]] [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], is one of the underlying reasons for U.S. and Turkish interests in the region:

{{Quote|text=These are not just geopolitical fights based on principle, but these fights are based on real material realities, real material advantages. So you look at the routes of these various pipelines that are being proposed and actually built to bring natural gas from Central Asia to the European markets. Turkey felt that it was in their interest to make sure that they can influence the best deal possible that will allow them to be positioned to take full advantage of these pipelines.  That's one of the reasons many people argue that Syria had to go: that when there were proposals to run these natural gas pipelines from Iran through Iraq and through Syria, that it was a direct threat to some of the ambitions that [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdogan]] has for Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://noliesradio.org/archives/90073 |title=Ajamu Baraka &amp; Ibrahim Soudy on ISIS &amp; 9/11 deceptions — on Kevin Barrett’s Truth Jihad Radio |website=No Lies Radio |host=Kevin Barrett |date=October 17, 2014 |time=10:00 |access-date=August 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Baraka has rejected the U.S. position that [[President of Syria|Syrian president]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] and the [[Syrian presidential election, 2014|2014 Syrian presidential election]] are [[Legitimacy (political)|illegitimate]]. In an article, he wrote that the idea of Assad's illegitimacy had been "carefully cultivated by Western state propagandists and dutifully disseminated by their auxiliaries in the corporate media."&lt;ref name="BarakaSyriaJune2014"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/06/04/the-syrian-elections/|title=The Syrian Elections|date=June 4, 2014|website=[[CounterPunch]]|access-date=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that the election was proof that Syrians have "not surrendered their national sovereignty to the geostrategic interests of the U.S. and its colonial allies in Europe and Israel," and accused the U.S. of hypocrisy for supporting [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2014|elections in Ukraine]] but not Syria.&lt;ref name="BarakaSyriaJune2014" /&gt; [[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] criticized Syria's holding of an election during an ongoing civil war for undermining a political solution to the conflict,&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reuters.com/article/idUSBREA3K0ST20140421?irpc=932|title=Syrian election will undermine political solution: U.N.'s Ban|agency=Reuters|date=April 21, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of independent [[election monitoring]] was widely reported.&lt;ref name="mon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrian-election-sends-powerful-signal-of-assads-control/2014/06/03/16876fca-eb2a-11e3-b98c-72cef4a00499_story.html|title=Syrian election sends powerful signal of Assad’s control|last=Sly|first=Liz|newspaper=Washington Post|date= June 3, 2014|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ukraine ====
Baraka characterized the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] as a "U.S.-supported coup" that contained "racist neo-Nazi elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/02/18/obamas-legacy-permanent-war-and-liberal-accommodation/|title=Obama’s Legacy: Permanent War and Liberal Accommodation?|last=Baraka|first=Ajamu|newspaper=CounterPunch|date=February 18, 2015|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[2014 Odessa clashes]], which resulted in the deaths of 42 pro-Russian and six pro-Ukrainian protestors, Baraka wrote that he was "outraged by the murder of people defending their rights to self-determination at the hands of U.S.-supported thugs in [[Odessa]]."&lt;ref name="benghazi" /&gt; He has also suggested that the victory of [[Petro Poroshenko]] in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2014|2014 Ukrainian presidential election]] was illegitimate, questioning "what makes the election in Ukraine legitimate when half of the country boycotts the vote and the national army violently attacks its own citizens in Eastern Ukraine who refused to recognize the legitimacy of the coup-makers in Kiev".&lt;ref name="BarakaSyriaJune2014" /&gt;

Two days after the event, Baraka expressed his suspicions that the shootdown of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] over [[Ukraine]] was a "[[false flag]]" operation, saying: "Someone wrote about three weeks ago that we should expect a major false flag operation in eastern Ukraine that's going to be then blamed on the Russians. And that's exactly what has happened. They're trying to say in the Western press that the Ukrainian government does not have access to that kind of weaponry, when it's clear that they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://noliesradio.org/archives/85748 |title=Sander Hicks, Jim Fetzer, Ajamu Baraka — on Kevin Barrett’s Truth Jihad Radio |website=No Lies Radio |host=Kevin Barrett |date=July 19, 2014 |time=1:31:00 |access-date=August 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailybeast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/17/the-wild-beliefs-of-ajamu-baraka-jill-stein-s-green-party-running-mate.html| title=The Wild Beliefs of Ajamu Baraka, Jill Stein’s Green Party Running Mate|last=Resnick|first=Gideon|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=August 17, 2016|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized Western media coverage of the event for "undermining anything coming from [[Russia Today]].

==== Nigeria ====
Baraka has criticized calls for Western military action against the [[jihadist]] [[List of active rebel groups#Groups which control territory|rebel group]] [[Boko Haram]], arguing that "a purely military response will only exacerbate an insurgency whose roots lie in the complex socio-historical conditions and internal contradictions of Northeast Nigeria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Girls are Still Not Home: Boko Haram and the Politics of Death |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/01/30/our-girls-are-still-not-home-boko-haram-and-politics-death |website=[[Common Dreams]] |accessdate=August 13, 2016 |date=January 30, 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217234107/http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/01/30/our-girls-are-still-not-home-boko-haram-and-politics-death |archivedate=December 17, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, a month after Boko Haram [[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping|kidnapped 276 schoolgirls]] from the northern Nigerian town of [[Chibok]], he expressed skepticism about the official version of events and the number of victims, saying that "even if there was a kidnapping, there's some people who are suggesting that the numbers are in fact inflated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://noliesradio.org/archives/82532 |title=Ajamu Baraka: Boko Haram part of US destabilization agenda _ on Kevin Barrett’s Truth Jihad Radio |website=No Lies Radio |host=Kevin Barrett |date=May 20, 2014 |time=10:13 |access-date=August 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka also stated that while he was "outraged" by the kidnapping, he was also suspicious of U.S. humanitarian concerns in the region: "U.S. policymakers don’t give a damn about the schoolgirls in Nigeria because their real objective is to use the threat of Boko Haram in the northern part of the country to justify the real goal of occupying the oil fields in the south and to block the Chinese in Nigeria."&lt;ref name="benghazi"&gt;{{cite web

=== Terrorism ===

==== Views on Je suis Charlie movement====
In a January 2015 essay, Baraka described the [[Republican marches|Republican march]] in [[Paris]] in reaction to the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] as a "white power march," and the [[Je suis Charlie]] movement in general as an "arrogant rallying cry for white supremacy".&lt;ref name="charlie" /&gt; Baraka condemned what he perceived as the disproportionate interest in the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and the relative lack of interest in the [[2015 Baga massacre|Baga massacre]] in [[Nigeria]] by [[Boko Haram]], which took place days before the Charlie Hebdo shooting and resulted in many more deaths. Baraka also criticized the "degrading ritual" of assimilation that Arabs and Muslims undergo in France, the "arrogant lack of respect for the ideas and culture of non-European peoples" that led to the [[French ban on face covering]] in public spaces, and the "racist" and "Islamophobic" character of Charlie Hebdo's recent publications.&lt;ref name="charlie"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dissidentvoice.org/2015/01/the-charlie-hebdo-white-power-rally-in-paris//|title=The Charlie Hebdo White Power Rally in Paris: A Celebration of Western Hypocrisy|website=Dissident Voice|language=en-US|date=January 14, 2015|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraka's "Je suis Charlie" article was republished in January 2016 in an anthology about the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]]. The book, titled ''ANOTHER French False Flag? Bloody Tracks from Paris to San Bernadino'', was edited by Kevin Barrett, a [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] and [[9/11 Truth movement|9/11 conspiracy theorist]].&lt;ref name="Gawker"&gt;{{Cite web|author=O'Connor, Brendan |url=http://gawker.com/stein-campaign-says-running-mate-didn-t-realize-he-was-1785157203 |title=Stein Campaign Says Running Mate Didn’t Realize He Was Talking to and Being Republished By Holocaust Denier |website=[[Gawker]] |date=August 11, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812003155/http://gawker.com/stein-campaign-says-running-mate-didn-t-realize-he-was-1785157203 |archivedate=2016-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka also has appeared at least twice on Barrett's radio show.&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt; Other contributors to the anthology (including controversial figures such as [[Gilad Atzmon]] and [[Alain Soral]])&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt; posited "that the Charlie Hebdo attacks and many others were perpetrated by the CIA and [[Mossad]]" as "[[false flag]]s."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;Yair Rosenberg, [http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/210549/friends-dont-let-friends-vote-for-jill-stein Friends Don't Let Friends Vote for Jill Stein], ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' (August 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yair Rosenberg]] of ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' described the work as a "veritable who's who of bigots and conspiracy theorists."&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"/&gt;

In August 2016, Baraka said that he had been unaware both of Barrett's Holocaust beliefs and of the views of some of the book's other contributors.&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt; In a statement, Baraka said that he would be "happy to discuss the details" of his own writing, but that he rejected any "smear campaign" based on the authors and contents of the rest of the book.&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt; [[Jill Stein]] campaign press director Meleiza Figueroa also clarified that Baraka is not a Holocaust denier.&lt;ref name="Gawker"/&gt;

==== Charleston massacre ====
In an article titled "No 'Je Suis Charleston'?" Baraka contended that a collective response similar to "Je suis Charlie" was absent after the [[Charleston church shooting]] at the [[Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church|Emanuel AME Church]], and criticized Obama for not calling suspect [[Dylann Roof]] a terrorist.&lt;ref name="blackagendareport.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackagendareport.com/no_je-suis_charleston_de-politicization_of_black_oppression|title=No ‘Je Suis Charleston’?: The De-Politicization of Black Oppression|date=June 30, 2015|website=Black Agenda Report|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a longtime opponent of the death penalty, Baraka has also criticized the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s decision to seek the death penalty for Roof, saying that it "should be seen as no more than another tactical move by the state as part of the last phase of the counterinsurgency launched against the black liberation movement. [...] By appealing to African Americans, the group in the country most consistently opposed to the death penalty, state propagandists saw this as a perfect opportunity to undermine opposition to capital punishment and facilitate the process of psychological incorporation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackagendareport.com/muhammad_ali_and_dylan_roof/|title=Muhammad Ali and Dylann Roof: Contested Meanings and Contested Lies|website=Black Agenda Report|language=en-US|date=June 14, 2016|access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politicians and activists ===

==== Barack Obama ====
Baraka referred to President [[Barack Obama]] as an "[[Uncle Tom]] president" because Obama condemned the 2014 [[Ferguson unrest|riots and violence]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]] that occurred after the [[Shooting of Michael Brown|death of Michael Brown]].&lt;ref name="dailybeast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajamubaraka.com/black-lives-dont-matter-in-racist-capitalist-america/ |title=Black Lives Don’t matter in Racist, Capitalist "America" |last1=Baraka |first1=Ajamu |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Defending his use of the term, Baraka later said that he was speaking to a "specialized audience" and was attempting to "shock people into a more critical look at this individual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mic.com/articles/151914/jill-stein-s-vp-doubles-down-on-calling-obama-uncle-tom-in-truly-wild-town-hall |title=Jill Stein's VP doubles down on calling Obama "Uncle Tom" in truly wild town hall |last1=Cahn |first1=Emily |date=August 18, 2016 |website=[[Mic (media company)|Mic.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka has also argued that Obama has shown "obsequious deference to white power,"&lt;ref name="popres"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popularresistance.org/martin-luther-king-my-dream-is-not-obama/|title=Martin Luther King: "My Dream is Not Obama"|date=August 19, 2013|website=Popular Resistance|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Obama and [[Loretta Lynch]] are members of the "black [[Petite bourgeoisie|petit-bourgeoisie]] who have become the living embodiments of the partial success of the state’s attempt to colonize the consciousness of Africans/black people."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajamubaraka.com/muhammad-ali-and-dylann-roof-contested-meanings-and-contested-lies/|title=Muhammad Ali and Dylann Roof: Contested Meanings and Contested Lies|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraka was critical of the [[Obama administration]]'s decision to not attend the [[Durban Review Conference|2009 UN World Conference Against Racism]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestrategycenter.org/radio/2009/05/11/ajamu-baraka-un-world-conference-against-racism-obama-and-us-boycott|title=Ajamu Baraka: The UN World Conference Against Racism, Obama, and the US boycott|date=May 11, 2009|website=The Labor/Community Strategy Center|last1=Mann|first1=Eric|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Baraka stated that inviting Obama to the 50th anniversary of the [[1963 March on Washington]] "should be taken as an insult by everyone who has struggled and continues to struggle for human rights, peace and social justice."&lt;ref name="popres" /&gt; More recently, he has argued that "the Obama Administration collaborated with suppressing the 2009 report from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which identified violent white supremacist groups as a threat to national security more lethal than the threat from Islamic 'fundamentalists'."&lt;ref name="blackagendareport.com" /&gt;

In an October 2016 interview with ''[[The Detroit News]]'', Baraka described Obama as a "moral disaster" and one of "the worst things that has happened to African-American people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|title=Green Party’s Baraka: Obama has been ‘moral disaster’|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/10/18/baraka-green-party-vice-president/92384566/|website=The Detroit News|accessdate=October 19, 2016|date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bernie Sanders ====
Baraka referred to the presidential campaign of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Bernie Sanders]] as "media-driven pseudo-opposition"&lt;ref name="beyonce"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/02/11/beyonce-and-the-politics-of-cultural-dominance/|title=Beyonce and the Politics of Cultural Dominance|date=2016-02-11|website=CounterPunch|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "an ideological prop&amp;hellip; of the logic and interests of the capitalist-imperialist settler state."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a September 2015 article, Baraka condemned Sanders' foreign policy and his support for continuing Obama's program of [[drone strikes in Yemen]], claiming that "the world that a President Sanders promises" would be one with "continued war crimes from the sky with drone strikes and Saudi-led terror in support of the Western imperial project."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/09/16/the-yemen-tragedy-and-the-ongoing-crisis-of-the-left-in-the-united-states/|title=The Yemen Tragedy and the Ongoing Crisis of the Left in the United States|date=September 16, 2015|website=CounterPunch|access-date=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka argued that support for Sanders represents "a tacit commitment to [[Eurocentrism]] and the assumptions of normalized white supremacy" due to what he perceived as "indifference" to the lives lost during the drone campaign in Yemen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Bill Clinton ====
In June 2016, Baraka criticized the family of [[Muhammad Ali]] for inviting [[Bill Clinton]] to deliver the boxer's eulogy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/jill-stein-2016-hillary-clinton-republicans-214146 |title=Can the Green Party Win With ‘Jill, Not Hill’?|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka described Clinton as a "rapist" and "petty opportunist politician."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Cornel West ====
In September 2015, Baraka criticized [[Cornel West]] for supporting Bernie Sanders, saying that West was "sheep-dogging for the Democrats" by "drawing voters into the corrupt Democratic party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baraka|first1=Ajamu|title=Why is Cornel West Sheep-Dogging for the Democrats Again?|url=http://dissidentvoice.org/2015/09/why-is-cornel-west-sheep-dogging-for-the-democrats-again/|website=Dissident Voice|accessdate=August 9, 2016|date=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; West later endorsed [[Jill Stein]] after Sanders endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/7/18/why_a_member_of_the_democratic|title=Cornel West: Why I Endorse Green Party's Jill Stein Over "Neoliberal Disaster" Hillary Clinton|date=July 18, 2016 |website=Democracy Now |accessdate=August 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/287829-sanders-ally-cornel-west-backs-green-candidate |title=Sanders ally Cornel West backs Green candidate |first=Mark |last=Hensch |date=July 14, 2016 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=August 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Beyoncé ====
In February 2016, Baraka criticized [[Beyoncé]]'s performance of her song "[[Formation (song)|Formation]]" at the [[Super Bowl 50 halftime show]], which featured [[backup dancers]] dressed as [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], claiming that it was a "commodified caricature of black opposition."&lt;ref name="beyonce" /&gt; Baraka derided the performance as "mindless entertainment" and "a depoliticized spectacle by gyrating, light-skinned booty-short-clad sisters."&lt;ref name="beyonce" /&gt; Baraka claimed that the "white male capitalist patriarchy" was responsible for selecting Beyoncé to perform and would not have allowed "anything subversive or even remotely oppositional to the interests of the capitalist oligarchy" on stage.&lt;ref name="beyonce" /&gt;

In 1998, Baraka was one of 300 human rights workers honored by UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]].&lt;ref name="commondreams" /&gt; In 2001, Baraka was named "abolitionist of the year" by the [[National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty]] for his efforts to end the [[death penalty in the United States]].&lt;ref name="commondreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="woodhull"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ajamu Baraka (VA)|url=http://www.woodhullfoundation.org/about-us/advisory-council/ajamu-baraka-ga/|website=[[Woodhull Freedom Foundation]]|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred C. Loedding''' was an American [[aeronautics]] engineer.  He was born on February 17, 1906 and died on October 10, 1963.

A 1930 graduate of the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aeronautics, Loedding worked with the pioneering [[Bellanca Aircraft Company]] until 1938, when he became a civilian engineer for the U.S. Air Force at Wright Field, later [[Wright-Patterson Air Base]]. One of his specialties was low-aspect design aircraft, such as [[flying wing]]s or flying disk designs,&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mark A. and Wendy Connors. "[http://www.nicap.org/loedding/LoeddingBook.pdf Alfred Loedding &amp; The Great Flying Saucer Wave of 1947]"&lt;/ref&gt; including a 1948 patent registered with the U.S. Patent Office.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Swords. (2000) "[http://www.ufoscience.org/history/swords.pdf Project Sign and the Estimate of the Situation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029193012/http://www.ufoscience.org/history/swords.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1947, hundreds of [[unidentified flying object]] reports earned considerable mainstream publicity, and were taken seriously by the U.S. military. Due to his expertise in low-aspect aircraft design—similar to the "flying disk" or "flying saucer" shape of many reported UFOs—Loedding became the focus of early informal Air Force UFO reports, serving as  liaison between [[The Pentagon]] and Air Force officers Howard M. McCoy and William R. Clingerman.

From 1948 to 1949, Loedding was a member of [[Project Sign]], the formal UFO investigative arm of the Air Force. Loedding investigated many UFO reports and interviewed witnesses; [[Michael D. Swords]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Swords, "UFOs, the Military, and the Early Cold War" (pp. 82-122 in ''UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge'', [[David M. Jacobs]], editor; University Press of Kansas, 2000;)&lt;/ref&gt; described Loedding as part of "probably the most talented group to work on UFOs until the air force ended its investigation in 1969."

Crawford Young|title=Emancipating Cultural Pluralism|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2003|pages=86|isbn=0-7914-5597-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered the intellectual father of the land reform movement in modern Mexico embodied in Article 27 of the Constitution of 1917 "by transcending the Liberal taboo against state interference in the ownership and administration of private property."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley F. Shadle, ''Andrés Molina Enríquez: Mexican Land Reformer of the Revolutionary Era'', Tucson: University of Arizona Press 1994, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called "the Rousseau of the Mexican Revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Anita Brenner, ''The Wind That Swept Mexico: The History of the Mexican Revolution, 1910-1942.'' New York: Harper and Brothers Publishers 1943, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence &amp; work==
===''Los Grandes Problemas Nacionales''===
Molina Enríquez is best known for publishing ''Los Grandes Problemas Nacionales'' (The Great National Problems) in 1909,&lt;ref name="Windows"&gt;{{cite book|title=Windows to culture II: a reading comprehension textbook|publisher=UNAM|pages=22|isbn=968-36-6200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book highly critical of the [[Porfirio Díaz]] government.&lt;ref name="1940s"&gt;{{cite book|last=Niblo|first=Stephen R.|title=Mexico in the 1940s: Modernity, Politics, and Corruption|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1999|pages=368|isbn=0-8420-2795-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molina Enríquez characterized the period after 1821 as the era of national disintegration. The book highlighted issues of sharp political divisions, recurrent armed conflicts, and periodic foreign interventions.&lt;ref name="Insurrection"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tutino|first=John|title=From Insurrection to Revolution in Mexico: Social Bases of Agrarian Violence, 1750-1940|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|pages=130|isbn=0-691-02294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molina Enríquez focused particularly on two aspects, [[land reform]] and the rights of the indigenous people and their place in society socially. Molina Enríquez was arrested by the government of [[Francisco León de la Barra]] on August 25, 1911 for publishing the document, which has later been described as highly influential on the eve of the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Hacienda"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Eric Van|title=Hacienda and Market in Eighteenth-Century Mexico: The Rural Economy of the Guadalajara Region, 1675-1820|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2006|pages=xxi|isbn=0-7425-5356-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Absence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Peter V. N.|title=In the Absence of Don Porfirio: Francisco Leon de la Barra and the Mexican|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1999|pages=181|isbn=0-8420-2774-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known quote from the book is "la hacienda no es negocio" [the [[hacienda]] is not a business]: "By this he meant that the large Mexican landed states of his day (and stretching back to their origins in the era of the Spanish conquest) were for the most part not profit-oriented but 'feudal' enterprises, that rural Mexico was therefore only partially capitalistic, if at all, and that the country was ipso facto only imperfectly modern."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Van Young, "[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/ethnohistory/v050/50.1van_young.html Beyond the Hacienda: Agrarian Relations and Socioeconomic Change in Rural Mesoamerica]," ''Ethnohistory'' 50:1 (2003): 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous rights===
Molina Enríquez argued indigenous people suffered because of position on national social structure. In order to resolve the suffering of the indigenous people, and create equality, Molina Enríquez believed they had to be integrated into the national state, this idea would be central to the indigenist movement when it went international.&lt;ref name="Indigenous"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Andrew|title=Indigenous Rights and Development: Self-determination in an Amazonian|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=1997|pages=50|isbn=1-57181-875-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molina Enríquez has been cited as arguing that the only true Mexicans were the [[mestizos]] and that they would be the inheritors of Mexico, classifying the other social group in Mexico as [[Criollo (people)|Criollos]], who were [[Spanish people|Spanish]]/[[French people|French]] in their thinking and ways, the mestizos to Molina Enríquez, were a new race, with a new culture of their own and the majority of Mexicans.&lt;ref name="Word"&gt;{{cite book|last=De Mente|first=Boye Lafayette|title=There's a Word for It in Mexico|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1998|pages=xxix|isbn=0-8442-7251-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land reform===
Molina Enríquez believed land reform was needed. In August 1911, he issued the Plan de Texcoco as a prelude to revolt, in which he called for establishing a [[dictatorship]] committed to land reform.&lt;ref name="Absence" /&gt; A version of the Plan de Texcoco was published in the newspaper ''El Imparcial'', which condensed the land reform section, with the Decree over the breaking up of large properties saying &lt;blockquote&gt;It is declared that on the basis of public utility, from the date of this decree [August 23, 1911], the partial expropriation of all the rural estates with a surface area that exceeds two thousand hectares. Popular action may denounce the real estate that should be expropriated in keeping with this law. The denouncer has the right to choose the best part of the land suitable for expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Plan de Texcoco by Andres Molina Enríquez published in ''El Imparcial'', translation by Stanley F. Shadle. Shadle, ''Andrés Molina Enríquez'', Appendix. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The role of the dictatorship would be to parcel out large [[hacienda]]s to individual, not communal claimants. Molina Enríquez would eventually go on to be a key adviser to the committee which drafted [[Mexican constitution#Article 27|article 27]] of the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution]] and a member of the National Agrarian Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Shadle, ''Andrés Molina Enríquez: Mexican Land Reformer of the Revolutionary Era''. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ideologues"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=William|title=Ideologues and Ideologies in Latin America|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1997|pages=62|isbn=0-313-30063-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Twentieth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raat|first=W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14378">[[Astronaut]]s hold a variety of ranks and positions, and each of these roles carries responsibilities that are essential to the operation of a spacecraft. A spacecraft's cockpit, filled with sophisticated equipment, requires skills differing from those used to manage the scientific equipment on board, and so on.

== NASA ranks and positions ==

=== Ranks ===
Members of the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] hold one of two ranks. Astronaut Candidate is the rank of those training to be NASA astronauts.

Upon graduation, candidates are promoted to Astronaut and receive their [[Astronaut Badge|Astronaut Pin]]. The pin is issued in two grades, silver and gold, with the silver pin awarded to candidates who have successfully completed astronaut training and the gold pin to astronauts who have flown in space.

[[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] is a position, not a rank.

| Responsible for knowing the CSM and their systems fully. Serve as flight engineer during launch phase while commander would be in full control of the vehicle. Perform navigation and mid-course correction procedures during trans-lunar and trans-earth phases of flight, command pilot of CSM during lunar orbit phase (when the mission commander is in control of the lunar module from separation phase until the LM docked back with CSM in lunar orbit). The CM pilot would also have other objectives during lunar orbit phase such as lunar photography, research and study for future landing sites for subsequent Apollo missions, deploy lunar satellite in some cases, as well as being responsible for relaying messages from mission control if radio contact with the LM was lost or weak, and also responsible for performing an orbital rescue with the LM if it were to malfunction and not be able to perform as needed to rendezvous with CSM as planned for in normal cases, but this never was needed. However, the CM pilot was responsible for docking the two ships together when the LM returned to orbit after being on the surface.

== Russian Federal Space Agency ranks and positions ==

=== Ranks ===
Russian astronauts are called cosmonauts. After initial training, cosmonauts are assigned as either a test-cosmonaut (космонавт-испытатель, kosmonavt-ispytatel’) or a research-cosmonaut (космонавт-исследователь, kosmonavt-issledovatel’). A test-cosmonaut has a more difficult preparation than a research-cosmonaut and can be the commander or the flight engineer of a spacecraft, while a research-cosmonaut cannot.&lt;ref name="cosmotraining"&gt;{{cite web|first=Suzy |last=McHale |url=http://suzymchale.com/ruspace/training.html |title=RuSpace - Suzy's Russian space site |publisher=Suzymchale.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Close Relationships|types}}
'''Concubinage''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|n|ˈ|k|juː|b|ᵻ|n|ᵻ|dʒ}}) is an [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] and [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationship]] in which the couple are not or cannot be married. The inability to marry may be due to multiple factors such as differences in social rank status, an existing marriage, religious or professional prohibitions (for example Roman soldiers), or a lack of recognition by appropriate authorities. The woman or man in such a relationship is referred to as a '''concubine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|ŋ|k|j|ᵿ|ˌ|b|aɪ|n}}).

The prevalence of concubinage and the status of rights and expectations of a concubine have varied among cultures, as have the rights of children of a concubine. Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. Historically, concubinage was frequently entered into voluntarily (by the woman or her family) as it provided a measure of economic security for the woman. Involuntary or servile concubinage sometimes involved sexual slavery of one member of the relationship, usually the woman. Nevertheless, sexual relations outside marriage were not uncommon, especially among royalty and nobility, and the woman in such relationships was commonly described as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The children of such relationships were counted as [[illegitimate]] and were barred from inheriting the father's title or estates, even when there was an absence of legitimate heirs.

While forms of long-term sexual relationships and [[co-habitation]] short of marriage have become increasingly common in the Western world, these are generally not described as concubinage. The terms concubinage and concubine are used today primarily when referring to non-marital partnerships of earlier eras. In modern usage, a non-marital domestic relationship is commonly referred to as co-habitation (or similar terms), and the woman in such a relationship is generally referred to as a [[girlfriend]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], [[fiancée]], lover or [[life partner]].

==In Asia==
Concubinage was highly popular before the early 20th century all over Asia. The main function of concubinage was producing additional heirs, as well as bringing males pleasure. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by the [[Dishu system]].

===China===
[[File:《万国来朝图》之乾隆后妃.jpg|thumb|Consorts and children of the [[Qianlong Emperor]], [[Qing dynasty]], 18th century]]
[[File:The Fourth Concubine of Hexing.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a concubine, by Chinese painter [[Lam Qua]], 1864]]
In China, [[Women in ancient and imperial China|successful men often had concubines]] until the practice was outlawed when the [[Communist Party of China]] came to power in 1949. The standard Chinese term translated as "concubine" was ''qiè'' {{lang|zh|妾}}, a term that has been used since ancient times, which means "concubine; I, your servant (deprecating self reference))". Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines ({{zh|t=婢妾|p=bì qiè}}) are of lower status, and their children are considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as ''pínfēi'' ({{zh|t=嬪妃}}), or "consorts of emperors", an official position often carrying a very high rank.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): ''Women and the Family in Chinese History''. Oxford: Routledge, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In premodern China it was illegal and socially disreputable for a man to have more than one wife at a time, but it was acceptable to have concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey 2002:39.&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest records a man could have as many concubines as he could afford. From the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]] period (AD 25–220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law. The higher rank and the more noble identity a man possessed, the more concubines he was permitted to have.&lt;ref&gt;Shi Fengyi 史凤仪 (1987): Zhongguo gudai hunyin yu jiating 中国古代婚姻与家庭 ''Marriage and Family in Ancient China''. Wuhan: Hubei Renmin Chubanshe, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concubine's treatment and situation was variable and was influenced by the social status of the male to whom she was attached, as well as the attitude of his wife. In the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' chapter on "The Pattern of the Family" ({{zh|t=內則}}) it says, “If there were betrothal rites, she became a wife; and if she went without these, a concubine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/liji/nei-ze#n9964|title=Nei Ze|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051012/http://ctext.org/liji/nei-ze#n9964|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives brought a [[dowry]] to a relationship, but concubines did not. A concubinage relationship could be entered into without the ceremonies used in marriages, and neither remarriage nor a return to her natal home in widowhood were allowed to a concubine.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2002: 60"&gt;Ebrey 2002: 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of the concubine was generally inferior to that of the wife. Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to a wife's children, although they were of higher status than illegitimate children. The child of a concubine had to show filial duty to two women, their biological mother and their legal mother—the wife of their father.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey 2002: 54.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of a concubine, her sons would make an offering to her, but these offerings were not continued by the concubine's grandsons, who only made offerings to their grandfather’s wife.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey 2002: 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are early records of concubines allegedly being buried alive with their masters to "keep them company in the afterlife".&lt;ref name="Concubines of Ancient China"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concubines of Ancient China|url=http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-history/concubines-of-ancient-china|work=Beijing Made Easy|publisher=Beijing Made Easy|accessdate=13 June 2012|year=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608030129/http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-history/concubines-of-ancient-china|archive-date=8 June 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1276), it was considered a serious breach of social ethics to promote a concubine to a wife.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2002: 60"/&gt;

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), the status of concubines improved. It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2002: 60"/&gt;

Imperial concubines, kept by emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], had [[ranks of imperial consorts in China|different ranks]] and were traditionally guarded by [[eunuch]]s to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor.&lt;ref name="Concubines of Ancient China"/&gt; In [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] (1368-1644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor. The age of the candidates ranged mainly from 14 to 16. Virtues, behavior, character, appearance and body condition were the selection criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu Zhonglin(Chung-lin Ch'iu)邱仲麟:"Mingdai linxuan Houfei jiqi guizhi" 明代遴選後妃及其規制 (The Imperial Concubine Selection System during the Ming Dynasty). Mingdai Yanjiu 明代研究 (Ming Studies) 11.2008:58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on Chinese concubines, there are several examples in history and literature of concubines who achieved great power and influence. Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in Chinese history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to [[Xianfeng Emperor]] and gave birth to his only surviving son, who later became [[Tongzhi Emperor]]. She eventually became the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of Qing China for 47 years after her husband's death.&lt;ref name=EmpressChina&gt;{{cite book|author= Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave|title=Dragon lady: the life and legend of the last empress of China|year=1993|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An examination of concubinage features in one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]], ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' (believed to be a [[autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] account of author [[Cao Xueqin]]'s family life).{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Three generations of the Jia family are supported by one notable concubine of the emperor, [[Jia Yuanchun]], the full elder sister of the male protagonist [[Jia Baoyu]]. In contrast, their younger half-siblings by concubine Zhao, [[Jia Tanchun]] and Jia Huan, develop distorted personalities because they are the children of a concubine.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

====Contemporary China====
The concept of men having relationships with one or more concubines has seen a comeback since modern China has prospered.{{according to whom|date=July 2018}} Mistresses are often viewed as concubines, inferior to the wife in status.{{by whom|date=July 2018}}

The women called '''er nai''', unofficial concubines, typically say they feel fine about exploiting their youth, beauty and wombs for the sake of earning money and protection from men.&lt;ref name=ModernConcubines&gt;{{cite web |title=Er nai - the modern Chinese concubine |url=http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-society/er-nai-modern-chinese-concubine |access-date=13 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092430/http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-society/er-nai-modern-chinese-concubine |archive-date=18 May 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ModernConcubines2&gt;{{cite news |title=Welcome back: Return of capitalism to China means a major comeback for the concubine |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/welcome-back-return-of-capitalism-to-china-means-a-major-comeback-for-the-concubine-1777215.html |newspaper=The Independent |author=Clifford Coonan |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=12 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202213523/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/welcome-back-return-of-capitalism-to-china-means-a-major-comeback-for-the-concubine-1777215.html |archive-date=2 February 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They rarely live with the primary wives, as in the past. The [[one-child policy]] in Mainland China has encouraged concubinage as men with power and wealth pursue a male heir.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Emperors' concubines and [[harems]] are emphasized in 21st-century romantic novels written for female readers and set in ancient times. As a plot element, the children of concubines are depicted with a status much inferior to that in actual history.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The '''zhai dou''' (residential intrigue) and '''gong dou''' (harem intrigue) genres show concubines and wives, as well as their children, scheming secretly to gain power. [[Empresses in the Palace]], a ''gong dou'' type novel and TV drama, has had great success in 21st-century China.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Hong Kong, Macau===
Hong Kong officially abolished the [[Great Qing Legal Code]] in 1971, which makes concubinage illegal. [[Stanley Ho]] of Macau took his "2nd wife" as his official concubine in 1957, and his "3rd and 4th wife" retain no official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiweibang.com/yuedu/101925130.html|title=港台剧怀旧经典|website=www.aiweibang.com|access-date=5 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923232525/http://www.aiweibang.com/yuedu/101925130.html|archive-date=23 September 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{See also|Ōoku}}
Before [[monogamy]] was legally imposed in the [[Meiji period]], concubinage was common among the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://departments.kings.edu/womens_history/concubin.html|title=Concubinage in Asia|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326034744/http://departments.kings.edu/womens_history/concubin.html|archive-date=26 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to ensure male heirs. For example, the son of an [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial]]  concubine often had a chance of becoming emperor. [[Yanagihara Naruko]], a high-ranking concubine of [[Emperor Meiji]], gave birth to [[Emperor Taishō]], who was later legally adopted by [[Empress Haruko]], Emperor Meiji's formal wife. Even among merchant families, concubinage was occasionally used to ensure heirs. [[Asako Hirooka]], an entrepreneur who was the daughter of a concubine, worked hard to help her husband's family survive after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. She lost her fertility giving birth to her only daughter, Kameko; so her husband—with whom she got along well—took Asako's maid-servant as a concubine and fathered three daughters and a son with her. Kameko, as the child of the formal wife, married a noble man and matrilineally carried on the family name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sankei.com/west/news/150602/wst1506020001-n1.html|title=【九転十起の女（２７）】女盛りもとうに過ぎ…夫とお手伝いの間に子供|first=SANKEI DIGITAL|last=INC.|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019020813/http://www.sankei.com/west/news/150602/wst1506020001-n1.html|archive-date=19 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea===
[[Joseon]] monarchs had a harem which contains concubines of different ranks. [[Empress Myeongseong]] managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines getting power.

Children of concubines often have lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine cannot be the wife of a wife-born son of the same class. For example, [[Jang Nok-su]] is a concubine-born daughter of a mayor, who was initially married to a slave-servant, later a high-rank concubine of [[Yeonsangun]].

==Greco-Roman Antiquity==
===Ancient Greece===
In [[Ancient Greece]], the practice of keeping a slave concubine ({{lang-grc|παλλακίς}} ''pallakís'') was little recorded but appears throughout Athenian history. The law prescribed that a man could kill another man caught attempting a relationship with his concubine for the production of free children, which suggests that a concubine's children were not granted citizenship.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes: The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens |page = 98 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While references to the sexual exploitation of maidservants appear in literature, it was considered disgraceful for a man to keep such women under the same roof as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes: The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens | pages = 98–99 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpretations of ''[[Hetaira|hetaera]]'' have held they were concubines when they had a permanent relationship with a single man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes: The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens | page = 101 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Roman ''concubinae'' and ''concubini''===
{{Details|Marriage in ancient Rome#Concubinage}}
Concubinage was an institution practiced in [[ancient Rome]] that allowed a man to enter into an informal but recognized relationship with a woman (''concubina'', plural ''concubinae'') who was not his wife, most often a woman whose lower [[social class in ancient Rome|social status]] was an obstacle to marriage. Concubinage was "tolerated to the degree that it did not threaten the religious and legal integrity of the family".&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Love in Ancient Rome (University of Oklahoma Press) 1986:111.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not considered derogatory to be called a ''concubina'', as the title was often inscribed on tombstones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kiefer, Sexual Life in Ancient Rome (Kegan Paul International) 2000:50.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''concubinus'' was a young male [[slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] [[Sexual slavery|sexually exploited]] by his master as a sexual partner (see [[homosexuality in ancient Rome]]). These relations, however, were expected to play a secondary role to marriage, within which institution an adult male demonstrated his masculine authority as head of the household (''[[pater familias]]''). In one of his [[epithalamium]]s, [[Catullus]] ({{floruit}} mid-1st century BC) assumes that the young bridegroom has a ''concubinus'' who considers himself elevated above the other slaves, but who will be set aside as his master turns his attention to marriage and family life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catullus]], ''Carmen'' 61; Amy Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), pp. 534–535.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Judaism ===
{{merge from|Pilegesh|date=November 2018}}
Among the [[Israelites]], men commonly acknowledged their concubines, and such women enjoyed the same rights in the house as legitimate wives.&lt;ref name="JewEncPil"&gt;{{cite web|title=PILEGESH (Hebrew, ; comp. Greek, παλλακίς).|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=313&amp;letter=P&amp;search=Pilegesh|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=13 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2002–2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In ancient Judaism====
The term concubine did not necessarily refer to women after the first wife. A man could have many wives and concubines. Legally, any children born to a concubine was considered to be the child of the wife to whom she was under. Sarah had to get Ishmael out of her house because legally Ishmael would always be the first born son even though Isaac was her natural child.
The concubine may not have commanded the exact amount of respect as the wife. In the [[Levitical]] rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as "wife" is distinct from the Hebrew word that means "concubine". However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife{{snd}} specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, wives often gave their maids to their husbands if they were barren, as in the cases of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and [[Rachel]] and [[Bilhah]]. The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife;&lt;ref name="JewEncPil" /&gt; for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later biblical figures such as Gideon, and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fiddlerandtaborer.png|thumb|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of the [[Benjamite]]s taking women of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] as concubines.]]
The account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19–20&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|19|NRVS}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|20|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a [[civil war]]. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe dedicated to the worship of God, who was undoubtedly dishonored both by the unfaithfulness of his concubine and her abandonment of him. However, after four months, he decides to make her fall in love with him again at her father’s house; he brings a servant and two asses to show off what glory he has. Her father seeks to keep him there until one day he refuses to remain and leaves. He is offered hospitality at Gibeah. The way in which his host's daughter is offered to the townsmen and the circumstances of his concubine's death at their hands describe a lawless time where visitors are both welcomed and threatened in equal measure. The Levite and his (male) host seek to protect themselves by offering their womenfolk, both the host’s virgin daughter and his companion’s concubine, to their aggressors for sex in exchange for their own safety. In the morning, the Levite tries to wake her up, but then realizes that she is dead. He dismembers her body and distributes her (body parts) throughout the nation of Israel to remind them of the blessing that God gave them of liberating them from the likewise sexually vicious and sadistic land of Egypt, and to inform them of the horribleness of the land of Gibeah. The sadistic rape of the concubine is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah and the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjaminites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in [[forced marriage]] to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjaminite survivors who still have no wives are granted a [[raptio|mass marriage by abduction]] by the other tribes.

====In modern Judaism====
In Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term [[pilegesh]] ({{lang-he|פילגש}}). The term is a loanword from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|παλλακίς}},&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "a mistress staying in house".

According to the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]],&lt;ref name="JewEncPil" /&gt; the difference between a concubine and a full wife was that the latter received a [[ketubah]] and [[Jewish wedding|her marriage]] (''nissu'in'') was preceded by an [[erusin]] ("formal betrothal"). Neither was the case for a concubine. One opinion in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] argues that the concubine should also receive a ''marriage contract'', but without a clause specifying a divorce settlement.&lt;ref name="JewEncPil" /&gt;

Certain Jewish thinkers, such as [[Maimonides]], believed that concubines were strictly reserved for Royal leadership, kings and queens, and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine. Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage.

Maimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.&lt;ref&gt;''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.

In the [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] of the contemporary [[Israel|State of Israel]], ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word "[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]"&amp;mdash;i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations&amp;mdash;regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kosher sex without marriage |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 March 2006 |author=Matthew Wagner |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230106/http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |archive-date=3 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Dickter, "ISO: Kosher Concubine", ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, "The Concubine Connection"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.li/20130103033314/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html |date=3 January 2013 }}, ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual slavery]] as concubinage in [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence]] is permitted in Islam which was not considered prostitution, and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archive-date=21 May 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

Concubinage is permitted and regulated in Islam. [[Al-Muminun]] 6 and [[Al-Maarij]] 30 both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess" (concubine/sexual slaves), saying " أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.  Sayyid [[Abul Ala Maududi]] explains that "two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one's possession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070311085024/http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|deadurl=yes|title=Surah - AL - MUMINOON|date=11 March 2007|archivedate=11 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Concubine" (''surriyya'') refers to the female slave (''jāriya''), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse. The word "''surriyya''" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression "[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines. Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam with Jews and non-Muslim people to marry concubine after teaching her and instructing her well and then giving them  freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | title=Al-Adab Al-Mufrad / Book-9 / Hadith-48 | publisher=quranx.com | accessdate=7 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062833/http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | archive-date=17 February 2017 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sikainga, Ahmad A. | title=Slaves Into Workers: Emancipation and Labor in Colonial Sudan | publisher=University of Texas Press | year=1996 | isbn=0-292-77694-2}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bloom, Jonathan |author2=Blair, Sheila | title=Islam: A Thousand Years of Faith and Power | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2002| isbn=0-300-09422-1}} p.48&lt;/ref&gt;  (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"/&gt;

Children of former concubines were generally declared as legitimate as they were born in wedlock, and the mother of a free child was considered free upon the death of the male partner.

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah]] (fixed-term marriage, called muta'a in [[Iraq]] and [[sigheh]] in [[Iran]]) which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = İlkkaracan | first = Pınar | title = Deconstructing sexuality in the Middle East: challenges and discourses | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pnGwP9-FhxYC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | publisher =Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2008 | page = 36  | isbn = 0-7546-7235-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah approximates prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = İlkkaracan |first = Pınar |title = Deconstructing sexuality in the Middle East: challenges and discourses |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pnGwP9-FhxYC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |publisher   =Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year = 2008 |page = 36 |isbn= 0-7546-7235-2 |deadurl = no |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151030194344/https://books.google.com/books?id=pnGwP9-FhxYC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |archivedate = 2015-10-30

&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution which has been sanctioned by the Twelver Shia authorities.

"Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution."&lt;/ref&gt; Religious supporters of mut'ah argue that temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of [[iddah]] in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a number of months before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than 3 or 4 times in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org].

In ancient times, two sources for concubines were permitted under an Islamic regime.

It was encouraged to [[manumit]] slave women who rejected their initial faith and embraced Islam, or to bring them into [[Marriage in Islam|formal marriage]].

====Modern times====
According to the rules of Islamic [[Fiqh]], what is ''halal'' (permitted) by Allah in the Quran cannot be altered by any authority or individual. Therefore, although the ''concept'' of concubinage is ''halal'', concubines are mostly no longer available in this modern era nor allowed to be sold or purchased in accordance with the latest human rights standards. However, as change of existing Islamic law is impossible, a concubine in this modern era, if existing,  must be given all the due rights that Islam had preserved in the past.

It is further clarified that all domestic and organizational female employees are not concubines in this era and hence sex is forbidden with them unless Nikah (formal marriage)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikah.com/marriage/definition_nikah.asp|title=Definition of Nikah (Islamic marriage)|author=|date=|work=nikah.com|accessdate=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806052730/http://www.nikah.com/marriage/definition_nikah.asp|archive-date=6 August 2004|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Nikah mut‘ah]]&lt;ref name="Mutahhari7"&gt;Motahhari M.

When [[slavery]] became institutionalized in the North American colonies, white men, whether or not they were married, sometimes took enslaved women and men as concubines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQzmjgSObrEC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=u.s.+slavery+concubine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi60NTmsMLcAhVD7qwKHaV5AugQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=u.s.%20slavery%20concubine&amp;f=false|title=Race, Gender, and Work: A Multi-cultural Economic History of Women in the United States|last=Amott|first=Teresa L.|last2=Matthaei|first2=Julie A.|date=1996|publisher=South End Press|isbn=9780896085374|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage between the races was prohibited by law in the colonies and the later United States. Many colonies and states also had laws against [[miscegenation]], or any interracial relations. From 1662 the Colony of Virginia, followed by others, incorporated into law the principle that children took their mother's status, i.e., the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''. All children born to enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of their father's status or ancestry.&lt;ref name="Kolchin17"&gt;[[Peter Kolchin]], ''American Slavery, 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; This led to generations of [[multiracial]] slaves, some of whom were otherwise considered legally white (one-eighth or less African, equivalent to a great-grandparent) before the [[American Civil War]].

In some cases, men had long-term relationships with enslaved women, giving them and their mixed-race children freedom and providing their children with apprenticeships, education and transfer of capital.  A purported [[Jefferson–Hemings controversy|relationship]] between [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Sally Hemings]] is an example of this.&lt;ref name="Hemings"&gt;[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html "Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430175449/http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html |date=30 April 2010 }}, Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Retrieved 22 June 2011. Quote: "Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings ... Since then, a committee commissioned by the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, after reviewing essentially the same material, reached different conclusions, namely that Sally Hemings was only a minor figure in Thomas Jefferson's life and that it is very unlikely he fathered any of her children. This committee also suggested in its report, issued in April 2001 and revised in 2011, that Jefferson's younger brother Randolph (1755-1815) was more likely the father of at least some of Sally Hemings's children."&lt;/ref&gt;   Such arrangements were more prevalent in the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] during the antebellum years.

===Plaçage===

{{main|Plaçage}}
In [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] and former French territories, a formalized system of concubinage called ''plaçage'' developed. European men took enslaved or [[free people of color|free women of color]] as mistresses after making arrangements to give them a dowry, house or other transfer of property, and sometimes, if they were enslaved, offering freedom and education for their children.&lt;ref name="everyculture.com"&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Creoles.html Helen Bush Caver and Mary T.

'''Curtis Sliwa''' (born March 26, 1954) is an American anti-crime activist, founder and CEO of the [[Guardian Angels]], radio talk show host, media personality, and chairman of the [[Reform Party of New York State]].

==Early life==

Sliwa was born into a Catholic family of [[Polish American|Polish]] and [[Italian American|Italian]] descent, in [[Canarsie, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BACK ON THE STREET WITH: Curtis Sliwa; Not Invincible, but Standing Fast | work = The New York Times | last = Witchel | first = Alex | date = November 12, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/12/garden/back-on-the-street-with-curtis-sliwa-not-invincible-but-standing-fast.html&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Aleta St. James' journey to motherhood | work = [[MSNBC]] | first = Katie | last = Couric | authorlink = Katie Couric | date = December 18, 2005 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10506847/ns/dateline_nbc/t/aleta-st-james-journey-motherhood/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Brooklyn Prep]], a [[Jesuit]] high school from which he was later expelled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Brooklyn's Favorite Crime-fighter, Curtis Sliwa, Is Honored by Local Politicians | work = Brooklyn Daily Eagle | date = March 6, 2008 | url = http://www.guardianangels.org/pdf/2373.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101020180038/http://guardianangels.org/pdf/2373.pdf | archivedate = October 20, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from [[Canarsie High School]], a New York City public high school. Prior to founding the [[Guardian Angels]], he was night manager of a [[McDonald's]] restaurant on [[Fordham Road]] in [[the Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Curtis Sliwa, CEO and Founder | publisher = Guardian Angels | url = http://www.guardianangels.org/curtis.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070905050453/http://www.guardianangels.org/curtis.html | archivedate = September 5, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guardian Angels==
[[File:Miami angels.jpg|thumb|left|[[Guardian Angels]] in [[Miami Metrorail]], 2001]]
In May 1977, Sliwa created the "Magnificent 13", a group dedicated to combating violence and crime on the [[New York City Subway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heathermgraham.com/2004/01/01/25-years-later-how-the-magnificent-13-became-the-guardian-angels/|title=25 Years Later, How The Magnificent 13 Became The Guardian Angels|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304220522/http://heathermgraham.com/2004/01/01/25-years-later-how-the-magnificent-13-became-the-guardian-angels/|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the city was experiencing a crime wave. The Magnificent 13 grew and was renamed the [[Guardian Angels]] in 1979. The group's actions drew strong reactions, both positive and negative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Either Right Or Wrong Angels On Patrol, 1980 | work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location = New York | last = Hester | first = Jere | date = November 9, 1998 | url = http://articles.nydailynews.com/1998-11-09/news/18081650_1_guardian-angels-curtis-sliwa-eight-angel | accessdate = 2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the police, public officials, residents, and the media. Throughout the early 1980s, the group's distinctive uniform, a [[military]] type [[red beret]] and white insignia T-shirt, became recognizable as the group grew and courted media attention. In 1992, Sliwa received the prestigious Courage of Conscience Award from the Peace Abbey, at the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in Boston.

In the early 1980s, he became active in [[Buffalo, New York]], and was often critical of local police policies and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = James Cunningham, Buffalo Police Commissioner, Dies | work = [[The New York Times]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = January 22, 1984 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/22/obituaries/jamescunningham68dies-buffalo-police-commissioner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sliwa continues to act as the president of the organization and oversees its worldwide operations. His ex-wife, Mary, was Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer. Sliwa frequently visits chapters throughout the world and graduates new chapters. Sliwa stated that as of 2011, the Guardian Angels operate in nine countries and 82 cities around the world, with approximately 5,000 members.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Fabrications===
Sliwa admitted that he had fabricated several of the Angels' exploits as well as a false allegation that he had been kidnapped in 1980 by off-duty [[New York City Transit Police|transit officers]]. He has also admitted, in later statements, to "faking several kidnapping attempts on himself to make himself seem more valuable to the public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police Union to Sue Sliwa Over Hoaxes | work = The New York Times | last = Gonzalez | first = David  | date = November 26, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/26/nyregion/police-union-to-sue-sliwa-over-hoaxes.html | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Guardian Angels Lose Home Base on Restaurant Row | work = The New York Times | last = Lambert | first = Bruce | date = October 29, 1995 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/29/nyregion/neighborhood-report-west-side-guardian-angels-lose-home-base-on-restaurant-row.html | accessdate = 2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there has been an allegation that Sliwa did not found the Guardian Angels; that, rather, the group owes its origins to Jeff and Jerry Monroe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therightperspective.org/2009/07/13/the-true-origins-of-the-guardian-angels/|title=The True Origins Of The Guardian Angelsdeadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730024924/http://www.therightperspective.org:80/2009/07/13/the-true-origins-of-the-guardian-angels/|archivedate=July 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder attempt==
On June 19, 1992, Sliwa was kidnapped and shot by two gunmen after entering a stolen taxi in Manhattan. The taxi picked up Sliwa near his home in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and a gunman hiding in the front passenger seat jumped up and fired several shots, hitting him in the groin and legs. The kidnapping was apparently foiled when Sliwa leapt from the front window of the moving cab and escaped. Sliwa underwent surgery for internal injuries and leg wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Koch Visits Sliwa as Investigation Fails to Yield Shooting Suspect | work = The New York Times | last = Bennet | first = James | date = June 21, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/21/nyregion/koch-visits-sliwa-as-police-inquiry-fails-to-yield-shooting-suspect.html | accessdate = 2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal prosecutors eventually charged [[John A. Gotti]], the son of [[Gambino crime family]] leader [[John Gotti]], with the attempted murder and a raft of other charges. Prosecutors claimed that Gotti was angered by remarks Sliwa had made on his radio program about Gotti's father. However, after three attempts to try him, the last on September 20, 2005, three separate juries were unable to agree to convict Gotti on all of the charges brought against him, and the charges were dropped. Jurors later told reporters they did believe he had a role in Sliwa's shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 3rd Gotti Jr. Trial Ends in Mistrial | work = [[The Washington Post]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | last = Neumeister | first = Larry | date = September 28, 2006 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092800169.html | accessdate = 2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors declined to re-try Gotti and dismissed the charges against him. Sliwa has said he would seek damages in civil court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = No Fourth Trial for Gotti, Prosecutors Say | work = The New York Times | last = Feuer | first = Allan | date = October 20, 2006 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/nyregion/21gotticnd.html | accessdate = 2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Yannotti, a Gotti associate, was also charged with shooting Sliwa in the incident but was acquitted. Yannotti, however, was sentenced to 20 years on an unrelated racketeering charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mob Goon's 20 Yrs.

==Media career==
[[File:Curtis Sliwa Cropped Sep3 2007.png|thumb|Sliwa in September 2007]]

===Radio===
Sliwa has become a [[populism|populist]] [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[talk radio|radio talk show]] host. His longtime broadcast partner was lawyer [[Ron Kuby]], with whom he had multiple times hosted in the past "Curtis &amp; Kuby" weekday radio show at noon, on [[WABC (AM)|WABC-AM]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisario|first1=Ben|title=Talk Radio on WABC Shifts Focus to the Local|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/business/media/talk-radio-on-wabc-shifts-focus-to-the-local.html?smid=tw-nytmedia&amp;seid=auto&amp;_r=2&amp;|work=The New York Times|date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in June 2017, Sliwa's co-host was attorney &amp; television commentator, [[Eboni Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eboni Williams To Co-Host With Curtis Sliwa|url=

Sliwa has been a radio broadcaster for more than two decades, most of that time on [[WABC (AM)|WABC-AM]], where he began his career in 1990. In 1994, the then city-owned and operated [[WNYC]] hired Sliwa, who had been released by WABC. Some, including Sliwa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = WNYC's Planned Move Will Finish Its Breakup With the City | work = The New York Times | last = Collins | first = Glenn | date = July 17, 2006 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/17/nyregion/17radio.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that he was forced on the station by newly elected mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], whom he had supported in the mayoral race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = City Radio Gives a Host's Job to Sliwa | work = The New York Times  | last = Martin | first = Douglas | date = February 9, 1994 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/09/nyregion/city-radio-gives-a-host-s-job-to-sliwa.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sliwa stayed four months in the position before moving back to commercial radio.

He was back at WABC in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Gunman's Tale of Fear, Hatred and Drugs | work = The New York Times | last = Nossiter | first = Adam | date = April 13, 1996 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/13/nyregion/a-gunman-s-tale-of-fear-hatred-and-drugs.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000, he became the co-host, with attorney [[Ron Kuby]], of the long-running ''Curtis and Kuby in the Morning''. The show lasted eight years before [[Citadel Broadcasting]] replaced the team with [[Don Imus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Curtis &amp; Kuby will 'go out with their heads high' | work = Daily News | location = New York | first = David | last = Hinckley | date = November 28, 2007 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2007/11/28/2007-11-28_curtis__kuby_will_go_out_with_their_head.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Curtis Sliwa LIVE'' program began national syndication on December 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC Radio Networks Launches Curtis Sliwa LIVE|url=http://affiliates.cumulusmedianetworks.com/press/2008releases/112008.pdf|publisher=ABC Radio Networks|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WABC retained Sliwa until November 2009, when his show was cancelled after a contract dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Curtis Sliwa is leaving WABC 770 AM | work = Daily News | location = New York | date = November 24, 2009 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/11/25/2009-11-25_curtis_sliwa_says_so_long_at_wabc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hosted both the morning and evening "drive time" shows on [[WNYM]]-AM 970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A big 'Apple' welcome for Sliwa | work = Daily News | location = New York | date = December 7, 2009 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/12/07/2009-12-07_untitled__inn07tv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of January 2, 2014, Sliwa returned to WABC, replacing [[Rush Limbaugh]] who moved to WOR-AM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The EIB Network Welcomes New Affiliates|url=

===Television===
Sliwa made weekly appearances as a commentator on [[NY1]]'s ''Inside City Hall''. He was suspended from the show for a month in April 2015 following sexual comments he made regarding New York City Council Speaker [[Melissa Mark-Viverito]], addressing himself as her "papi" and fantasizing about having sex with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Durkin|first1=Erin|title=NY1 suspends Curtis Sliwa for rants about City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny1-suspends-curtis-sliwa-comments-mark-viverito-article-1.2202853|work=New York Daily News|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sliwa defended his comments as satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fermino|first1=Jennifer|title=Curtis Sliwa — one day after his NY1 suspension — insists his comments about Melissa Mark-Viverito were 'satire'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/curtis-sliwa-insists-mark-viverito-comments-satire-article-1.2204302|work=New York Daily News|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In September 2016, Sliwa launched a [[hostile takeover]] of the [[Reform Party of New York State]]. In May 2018, Appellants withdrew their appeal and the status and leadership of the New York State Reform Party is no longer in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/whiteboard/2016/10/upstart-group-wins-legal-battle-over-control-of-the-reform-party-106901|title=Upstart group wins legal battle over control of the Reform Party|work=Politico|first=Bill|last=Mahoney|date=October 31, 2016|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party lost its ballot access in the November 2018 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsgrowl.com/reform-party-new-york-ballot-status/|title=Reform Party of New York &amp; Women's Equality Party lose ballot status|date=2018-11-07|work=News Growl|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

'''Diana, the Hon. Lady Mosley''' (17 June 1910{{spaced ndash}}11 August 2003), born '''Diana Freeman-Mitford''' and usually known as '''Diana Mitford''', was one of Britain's noted [[Mitford sisters]]. She was first married to [[Bryan Walter Guinness]], heir to the [[Baron Moyne|barony of Moyne]], and upon her divorce from him married  Sir [[Oswald Mosley]], [[Mosley Baronets|6th Baronet of Ancoats]], leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]]. Her second marriage, in 1936, took place at the home of [[Joseph Goebbels]], with [[Adolf Hitler]] as guest of honour. Subsequently, her involvement with Fascist political causes resulted in three years' [[internment]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. She later moved to Paris and enjoyed some success as a writer. In the 1950s she contributed diaries to ''[[Tatler]]'' and edited the magazine ''[[The European (1953 magazine)|The European]]''.&lt;ref name=pol&gt;{{cite book |year=2008 |first=Diana |last=Mitford |title=The Pursuit of Laughter |publisher=Gibson Square books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 she published her autobiography, ''[[A Life of Contrasts]]'',&lt;ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Asthall Manor, Asthall, nr Burford (Nancy).JPG|thumb|left|Rear view of Asthall Manor]]
Diana Mitford was the fourth child and third daughter of [[David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale]] (1878–1958, son of [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale]]), and his wife, Sydney (1880–1963), daughter of [[Thomas Gibson Bowles]], MP. She was a first cousin of [[Clementine Churchill]], second cousin of [[Angus Ogilvy]], and first cousin, twice removed, of [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mitford was born in [[Belgravia]] and raised in the country estate of [[Batsford Park]], then from the age of 10 at the family home, [[Asthall Manor]], in [[Oxfordshire]], and later at Swinbrook House, a home her father had built in the village of [[Swinbrook]]. She was educated at home by a series of governesses except for a six-month period in 1926 when she was sent to a day school in Paris. In childhood, her younger sisters [[Jessica Mitford]] ("Decca") and [[Deborah Mitford|Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]] ("Debo"), were particularly devoted to her.

At the age of 18, shortly after her presentation at Court, she became secretly engaged to [[Bryan Walter Guinness]]. Guinness, an Irish aristocrat, writer and brewing heir, would inherit the [[Baron Moyne|barony of Moyne]]. Her parents were initially opposed to the engagement but in time were persuaded. Sydney was particularly uneasy at the thought of two such young people having possession of such a large fortune, but she was eventually convinced Bryan was a suitable husband. They married on 30 January 1929; her sisters Jessica and Deborah were too ill to attend the ceremony. The couple had an income of £20,000 a year (the equivalent of £1,132,535.70 in 2016, adjusted for [[inflation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1633409/Historic-inflation-calculator-value-money-changed-1900.html&lt;/ref&gt;), an estate at [[Biddesden House|Biddesden]] in [[Wiltshire]], and houses in London and Dublin. They were well known for hosting aristocratic society events involving the [[Bright Young People]]. The writer [[Evelyn Waugh]] exclaimed that her beauty "ran through the room like a peal of bells", and he dedicated the novel ''[[Vile Bodies]]'', a satire of the [[Roaring Twenties]], to the couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article866159.ece |title=Obituary: The Hon Lady Mosley |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=13 August 2003 |location=London |first=Leo |last=Lewis |subscription=yes}}{{Failed verification|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her portrait was painted by [[Augustus John]], [[Pavel Tchelitchew]] and [[Henry Lamb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3148299.stm |title=Obituary: Lady Diana Mosley |publisher=BBC News |date=13 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two sons, [[Jonathan Guinness|Jonathan]] (b. 1930) and [[Desmond Guinness|Desmond]] (b. 1931).

[[File:Sir Oswald Mosley, 6th Bt by Glyn Warren Philpot.jpg|thumb|upright|Diana Mitford's second husband, Oswald Mosley]]
In February 1932, Diana met Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] at a garden party at the home of the society hostess [[Maud Cunard|Emerald Cunard]]. He soon became leader of the newly formed [[British Union of Fascists]], and Diana's lover; he was at the time married to [[Lady Cynthia Mosley|Lady Cynthia Curzon]], a daughter of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], former [[Viceroy of India]], and his first wife, the American mercantile heiress [[Mary Victoria Leiter]]. Diana left her husband, 'moving with a skeleton staff of nanny, cook, house-parlourmaid and lady's maid to a house at 2 [[Eaton Square]], round the corner from Mosley's flat',&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Spurling reviews Diana Mosley by Anne de Courcy, _The Telegraph, 17 Nov 2003 | https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3606612/Hitler-was-her-Uncle-Wolf.html&lt;/ref&gt; but Sir Oswald would not leave his wife. Quite suddenly, Cynthia died in 1933 of [[peritonitis]]. Mosley was devastated by the death of his wife, but later started an affair with her younger sister [[Lady Alexandra Curzon|Lady Alexandra Metcalfe]].&lt;ref name=Courcy&gt;{{cite book|last=de Courcy|first=Anne|title=Diana Mosley|year=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|isbn=1856192423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to Diana's parents' disapproval over her decision to leave Guinness for Mosley, she was briefly estranged from most of her family. Her affair and eventual marriage to Mosley also strained relationships with her sisters. Initially, Jessica and Deborah were not permitted to see Diana as she was "living in sin" with Mosley in London. Deborah eventually got to know Mosley and ended up liking him very much. Jessica despised Mosley's beliefs and became permanently estranged from Diana after the late 1930s. Pam and her husband [[Derek Jackson (physicist)|Derek Jackson]] got along well with Mosley. Nancy never liked Mosley and, like Jessica, despised his political beliefs, but was able to learn to tolerate him for the sake of her relationship with Diana. Nancy wrote the novel ''[[Wigs on the Green]]'', which satirised Mosley and his beliefs. After it was published in 1935 relations between the sisters became strained to non-existent and it was not until the mid-1940s that they were able to get back to being close again.&lt;ref name=Courcy /&gt;

The couple rented [[Wootton Lodge]], a country house in [[Staffordshire]] which Diana had intended to buy. She furnished much of her new home with much of the Swinbrook furniture that her father was selling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/03/1072908946395.html?from=storyrhs |title=Hand in hand with Hitler |last=de Courcy |first=Anne |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date= 4 January 2004 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mosleys lived at Wootton Lodge along with their children from 1936 to 1939.

===Third Reich===
In 1934 Mitford went to Germany with her then 19-year-old sister Unity. While there, they attended the first [[Nuremberg rally]] after the Nazi rise to power. A friend of Hitler's, Unity introduced Diana to him in March 1935. They returned again for the second rally later that year and were entertained as his guests at the 1935 rally. In 1936 he provided a [[Mercedes-Benz]] to chauffeur Diana to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Berlin Olympic games]]. She became well acquainted with [[Winifred Wagner]] and [[Magda Goebbels]].

Diana and Oswald wed in secret on 6 October 1936 in Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels' drawing room. Adolf Hitler, [[Robert Gordon-Canning]] and [[William Edward David Allen|Bill Allen]] were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Charlotte |editor-last=Mosley |year=2007 |title=The Mitfords: Letters between Six Sisters |page=77 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=978-0-06-137364-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was kept secret until the birth of their first child in 1938. In August 1939, Hitler told Diana over lunch that war was inevitable.

Mosley and Diana had two sons: (Oswald) Alexander Mosley (born 26 November 1938) and [[Max Mosley|Max Rufus Mosley]] (born 13 April 1940), president of the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) for 16 years. Hitler presented the couple with a silver framed picture of himself. The Mosleys were interned during much of [[World War II]], under [[Defence Regulation 18B]] along with other British fascists including [[Norah Elam]].&lt;ref name='McPherson &amp; McPherson'&gt;{{cite book |last=McPherson |first=Angela |last2=McPherson |first2=Susan |title=Mosley's Old Suffragette - A Biography of Norah Elam |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4466-9967-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MI5]] documents released in 2002 described Lady Mosley and her political leanings. "Diana Mosley, wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, is reported on the 'best authority', that of her family and intimate circle, to be a public danger at the present time. Is said to be far cleverer and more dangerous than her husband and will stick at nothing to achieve her ambitions. She is wildly ambitious."&lt;ref&gt;BBC News Online (Published: 2003/08/13 12:15:07 GMT). “Oswald Mosley's widow dies.” Story from BBC NEWS: http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/uk_news/3146225.stm&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 June 1940, eleven weeks after the birth of her fourth son Max, Diana was arrested (hastily stuffing Hitler's photograph under Max's cot mattress when the police came to arrest her) and taken to a cell in F Block in London's [[Holloway Prison]] for women. She and her husband were held without charge or trial under the provisions of 18B, on the advice of [[MI5]]. The pair were initially held separately but, after personal intervention by Churchill, in December 1941 Mosley and two other 18B husbands (one of them Mosley's friend Captain H.W. Luttman-Johnson) were permitted to join their wives at Holloway. After more than three years' imprisonment, they were both released in November 1943 on the grounds of Mosley's ill health; they were placed under house arrest until the end of the war and were denied passports until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;de Courcy, Anne (2003). ''Diana Mosley''. London: Chatto &amp; Windus, p. 297 {{ISBN|0-06-056532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Mosley's prison time failed to disturb her approach to life; she remarked in her later years that she never grew ''[[fraises des bois]]'' (wild strawberries) that tasted as good as those she had cultivated in the prison garden. Though prison was not something she would have chosen, she said, "It was still lovely to wake up in the morning and feel that one was lovely One," when she compared her lot to the other women incarcerated at Holloway. Oswald Mosley later mentioned this to Diana's sister Nancy, who in turn included the line in her novel, ''[[Love in a Cold Climate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mosley|first=Oswald|title=My Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARcmBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT347&amp;lpg=PT347&amp;dq=It+was+still+lovely+to+wake+up+in+the+morning+and+feel+that+one+was+lovely+one&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jyQiIeee3j&amp;sig=fFx5kWcQqphYi2b6knHC69b9-9U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DG2WVailCtG0ogTA8oHADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=It%20was%20still%20lovely%20to%20wake%20up%20in%20the%20morning%20and%20feel%20that%20one%20was%20lovely%20one&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to her obituary in the ''Daily Telegraph'', a diamond swastika was among her jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real History and Lady Diana Mosley |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=13 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
After the war ended the couple kept homes in [[Ireland]], with apartments in London and Paris. Their recently renovated [[Clonfert]] home, a former Bishop's palace, burned down in an accidental fire. Diana recalled in her memoirs that the fire could have been extinguished had it not been for their cook who ran back to her room to retrieve her possessions and in doing so delayed efforts to control the fire. Following this, they moved to a home near [[Fermoy]], [[County Cork]], later settling permanently in France, at the Temple de la Gloire,[https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_de_la_Gloire_(Orsay)] a Palladian temple in [[Orsay]], southwest of Paris, in 1950. Gaston and Bettina Bergery had told the Mosleys that the property was on the market. They were neighbours of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Duke]] and [[Duchess of Windsor]], who lived in the neighbouring town [[Gif-sur-Yvette]], and soon became close friends with them. The Duchess of Windsor, upon seeing the "Temple de la Gloire" (built in 1801 to honour the French victory of December 1800 at Hohenlinden, near Munich) for the first time, was said to have remarked, "Oh, it's charming, charming but where do you ''live''?" {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Once again they were well known for entertaining, but were barred from all functions at the British Embassy. During their time in France, the Mosleys quietly went through another marriage ceremony; Hitler had safeguarded their original marriage licence, and it was never found after the war. During this period, Mosley was unfaithful to Diana, but she found for the most part that she was able to learn to keep herself from getting too upset regarding his adulterous habits. The only time she and sister Jessica communicated with each other following their estrangement was when they were both taking care of their sister Nancy. Nancy was at [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], and was battling [[Hodgkin's disease]]. Soon after Nancy's death in 1973, all communication between the sisters ceased. Diana was also a lifelong supporter of the [[British Union of Fascists]] (BUF), and its postwar successor the [[Union Movement]], to which she made financial contributions until the 1994 death of its organiser [[Jeffrey Hamm]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

At times she was vague when discussing her loyalties to Britain, her strong belief in fascism, and her attitude to Jews. In her 1977 autobiography ''A Life of Contrasts'' she wrote, "I didn't love Hitler any more than I did Winston [Churchill]. I can't regret it, it was so interesting." At other times, however, she behaved so as to suggest intense anti-semitic attitudes; the journalist [[Paul Callan]] remembered mentioning that he was Jewish while interviewing her husband in Diana's presence. According to Callan, "I mentioned, just in the course of conversation, that I was Jewish—at which Lady Mosley went ashen, snapped a crimson nail and left the room .... No explanation was given but she would later write to a friend: A nice, polite reporter came to interview Tom [as Mosley was known] but he turned out to be Jewish and was sitting there at our table. They are a very clever race and come in all shapes and sizes."&lt;ref name="express.co.uk"/&gt;

On the other hand, when in 1989 she was invited to appear on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' with [[Sue Lawley]], she caused controversy by saying she had not believed in the fact of the extermination of Jews by Hitler until "years" after the war, and, when asked if she now believed it, by replying that she could not believe it was six million, a figure she described as "not conceivable," adding that "whether it's six or one really makes no difference morally, it's equally wrong; I think it was a dreadfully wicked thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |timecaption=Event occurs between |time=16:30 and 17:25 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/85ff774f#p009mdck |title=Desert Island Discs - Castaway: Lady Mosley |work=[[BBC]] |date=26 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her choices of music to be played on Desert Island Discs were: [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)]], "Casta Diva" from ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' ([[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]), [[Anthem of Europe|"Ode to Joy"]] ([[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]), ''[[Die Walküre]]'' ([[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]), ''[[Liebestod]]'' ([[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]), "L'amour est un oiseau rebelle" from ''[[Carmen]]'' ([[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]), "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]" ([[Procol Harum]]) and [[Polonaise in F-sharp minor, Op. 44 (Chopin)|Polonaise in F-sharp minor]] ([[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |timecaption=Event occurs between |time=01:00 and 05:20 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/85ff774f#p009mdck |title=Desert Island Discs - Castaway: Lady Mosley |work=[[BBC]] |date=26 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, due to her advancing age, she moved out of the Temple de la Gloire and into a Paris apartment. Temple de la Gloire was subsequently sold for £1 million in 2000. Throughout much of her life, particularly after her years in prison, she was afflicted by regular bouts of migraines. In 1981, she underwent a successful surgery to remove a [[brain tumour]]. She convalesced at [[Chatsworth House]], the residence of her sister Deborah. In the early 1990s, she was also successfully treated for [[skin cancer]]. In later life she also suffered from deafness.{{citation needed |date=May 2012}}

Mitford attended the funeral of [[René de Chambrun]], the son-in-law of Vichy France Prime Minister [[Pierre Laval]], in 2002.&lt;ref name="pourcherlavalmuseum"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pourcher|first1=Yves|title=Laval Museum|journal=Historical Reflections|date=Spring 2012|volume=38|issue=1|page=122|doi=10.3167/hrrh.2012.380108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Mosley was shunned in the British media for a period after the war and the couple established their own publishing company, Euphorion Books, named after a character in ''[[Faust]]''. This allowed Mosley to publish and Diana was free to commission a cultural list.{{Clarify|date=October 2010}} After his release from jail, Mosley declared the death of fascism. Diana initially translated [[Goethe]]'s ''Faust''. Other notable books published by Euphorion under her aegis included ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'' (translated by Nancy, 1950), [[Niki Lauda]]'s memoirs (1985), and [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]]'s memoirs, ''Stuka Pilot''. She also edited several of her husband's books.

While in France, Diana edited the fascist cultural magazine ''[[The European (magazine)|The European]]'' for six years, and to this magazine she herself sometimes contributed material. She provided articles, book reviews, and regular diary entries. Many of her contributions were republished in 2008 in ''[[The Pursuit of Laughter]]''. In 1965, she was commissioned to write the regular column ''Letters from Paris'' for the ''[[Tatler (1901)|Tatler]]''. She was an avid reader and critic of contemporary literature, reviewing for many publications, such as the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and ''Books &amp; Bookmen''. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} She specialised in reviewing autobiographical and biographical accounts as well as the occasional novel. Characteristically she would provide commentary of her own experiences with and knowledge of the subject of the book she was reviewing. She was the lead literary reviewer for the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' during [[A.N. Wilson]]'s tenure as literary editor. In 1996, and on personal grounds, the new editor [[Max Hastings]] insisted that she no longer be contracted by the newspaper. Following Hastings' retirement in 2001, the newspaper published several more book reviews by her until her death in 2003. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

She wrote the foreword and introduction of ''Nancy Mitford: A Memoir'' by [[Harold Acton]]. She produced her own two books of memoirs: ''[[A Life of Contrasts]]'' (1977, [[Hamish Hamilton]]), and ''[[Loved Ones (book)|Loved Ones]]'' (1985). The latter is a collection of pen portraits of close relatives and friends such as the writer [[Evelyn Waugh]] among others. In 1980 she released ''[[The Duchess of Windsor (Mosley biography)|The Duchess of Windsor]]'', a biography. New, updated editions of  ''A Life of Contrasts'' and ''The Duchess of Windsor'' were released in 2002 and 2003, respectively. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In 2007, letters between the Mitford sisters, including ones to and from Diana, were published in the compilation ''[[The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters]]'', edited by Charlotte Mosley. The book received critical acclaim; in a review published in ''The Sunday Times'', journalist [[India Knight]] noted that Diana was "briefly sinister but also clever, kind, and fatally loyal to her Blackshirt husband, Oswald Mosley."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article2348736.ece |title=REVIEW: The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=2 September 2007 |location=London |first=India |last=Knight |subscription=yes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616111915/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article2348736.ece |archivedate=16 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A following collection consisting of her letters, articles, diaries and reviews was released as ''[[The Pursuit of Laughter]]'' in December 2008.

===Death===

Diana died in Paris in August 2003, aged 93. Her cause of death was given as complications related to a stroke she had suffered a week earlier, but reports later surfaced that she had been one of the many elderly fatalities of the [[2003 European heat wave|heat wave of 2003]] in mostly non-air-conditioned Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/13/1060588457054.html |title=Mitford sister who befriended Hitler dies, aged 93 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |date=14 August 2003  |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried at St Mary's Churchyard, [[Swinbrook]], [[Oxfordshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3146225.stm |title=Oswald Mosley's widow dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside her sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Location 32826). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was survived by her four sons: [[Desmond Guinness]]; [[Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne]]; Alexander and [[Max Mosley]]. Her stepson [[Nicholas Mosley, 3rd Baron Ravensdale|Nicholas Mosley]] is a novelist who also wrote a critical memoir of his father for which Diana reportedly never forgave him, despite their previously close relationship. One of her great-granddaughters, [[Jasmine Guinness]], a great-niece, [[Stella Tennant]], a granddaughter, [[Daphne Guinness]] and a grandson, Tom Guinness, are models.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Enrique Flores Magon-1918.jpg|right|thumb|Enrique Flores Magón in 1918]]

'''Enrique Flores Magón''' (13 April 1877 – 28 October 1954) was a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] journalist and politician, associated with the [[Mexican Liberal Party]] and [[anarchism]]. His name is most frequently linked with that of his elder brother, [[Ricardo Flores Magón]], and the political philosophy they espoused, ''[[magonism]]o''. Another brother was [[Jesús Flores Magón]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Teotitlán del Camino]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Teotitlán de Flores Magón |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20545a.htm |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |author=[[INAFED]] |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529045549/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20545a.htm |archivedate=2007-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
(since renamed Teotitlán de Flores Magón) in the state of [[Oaxaca]] on 13 April 1877,
to Margarita Magón and Teodoro Flores, a [[Nahua people|Nahua]] who had fought in [[Benito Juárez]]'s Liberal Army.
At an early age the family relocated to [[Mexico City]]. He was a student in the capital in 1884 when demonstrations broke out against the third re-election of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]].
By 1902 he and his brother Ricardo, working on the anti-Díaz broadsheet ''[[El hijo de El Ahuizote]],'' were arrested and incarcerated in the military prison at [[Santiago Tlatelolco]]. While in prison the brothers explored the ideas of writers such as [[Kropotkin]], [[Sébastien Faure|Faure]], [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Maxim Gorki]], and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] and discussed the possibility of disseminating [[anarchist]] ideas in Mexico.

Upon their release from prison in January 1903, the brothers returned to publishing  ''El hijo del Ahuizote'' and, on 5 February of that year, Enrique Flores Magón drew a banner declaring "[[1857 Constitution of Mexico|The Constitution]] is Dead", which they hung in front of its offices.

On 2 April 1903, they and other liberals stormed a pro-Díaz demonstration and succeeded in turning it into an anti-Díaz event, calling for the dictator's death. On 11 April Enrique Flores Magón was arrested again; he was later released, but subject to a ban on publishing any written materials. As a result, Enrique and Ricardo left Mexico for the [[United States]], arriving in [[Laredo, Texas]] in late 1903.

Enrique lived in several cities around the U.S. and Canada, concealing his identity, constantly changing address, and frequently losing contact with Ricardo. In [[St. Louis, Missouri]], he helped draft the platform of the [[Mexican Liberal Party]] (PLM).

He recommenced publication in the United States of the newspaper  ''[[Regeneración (Periódico)|Regeneración]],''
which the brothers had founded in 1900, and organized a clandestine network for its distribution in Mexico. He continued in these endeavours until 1917, when he left the Organizing Committee of the  PLM and the ''Regeneración'' editorial team.

Following Ricardo's death in 1922, he returned to Mexico in 1923, where he had a series of disagreements with former magonistas.
In 1933 he helped leaders of the National Agrarian League found the [[Confederación Campesina Mexicana]] in [[San Luis Potosí]].

He died in [[Mexico City]] on 28 October 1954.

In 1916, Moir and Grant enlisted with Dr Elsie Inglis unit of the [[Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service]], known as the SWH,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the two women embarked on the troopship ''Hanspiel'' in Liverpool, sailing from there to the port of [[Arkhangelsk]] in Russia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  While aboard ship Moir began recording her experiences in a diary and scrapbook which she kept for the next three years.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalcollections.org.uk/index.php?a=ViewItem&amp;i=41034&amp;WINID=1487863991257|title=Capital Collections: There's a Long Long Trail A-Winding - vol 1|last=|first=|date=|website=Capital Collections - the image library for the collections of Edinburgh Libraries Museums and Galleries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moir notes in her diary that the ship arrived in [[Arkhangelsk]] on 10 September 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalcollections.org.uk/index.php?a=ViewItem&amp;key=RHsiRCI6IlwiVGhlcmUncyBhIExvbmcgTG9uZyBUcmFpbCBBLVdpbmRpbmcgLSB2b2wgMVwiIEV4aGliaXRpb24gY29udGFpbnMgdGhlc2UgaW1hZ2VzIiwiTiI6MzU5LCJQIjp7InR5cGUiOiJmb3J3YXJkIiwicmVsYXRpb25faWQiOiIyIiwiaXRlbV9pZCI6IjQxMDM0In19&amp;pg=19&amp;mode=thumb&amp;WINID=1487863991257#zFJiKZ5cE6kAAAFaa4U1Bw/25287|title=Capital Collections: Page 9 from Ethel Moir Diary, Vol 1|last=Moir|first=Ethel|date=12 September 1916|website=Capital Collections - the image library for the collections of Edinburgh Libraries Museums and Galleries|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and from there the unit  moved upriver to Bacheridza where they were visited by local dignitaries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While in the area Moir and Grant visited a local village and Moir recorded a number of local words and customs in her diary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The unit left Bacheridza by train and travelled via Moscow to the Front where they joined the [[First Serbian Volunteer Division]] in Odessa&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956765889|title=1916 : a global history|last=Keith|first=Jeffery|publisher=|year=|isbn=1408834316|location=|pages=|oclc=956765889|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and set up a field hospital in a barn housing 200 injured soldiers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In her diary, Muir records that the field hospital had no lighting and that water had to be carried from a pump on a hillside some distance away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In late September Moir and the SWH moved to [[Medgidia]], close to the front line, where they set up a hospital treating both Serbian and Russian troops.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  By the end of 1916 Moir's unit returned to Odessa and established a hospital where Moir worked in the theatre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ethel arrived back in Scotland in March 1917, her ship having been diverted to [[Lerwick]] as it was carrying a cargo of zinc-spelter for munitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://talesofonecity.wordpress.com/2016/06/07/theres-a-long-long-trail-a-winding-part-1/|title=There’s a Long Long Trail A-Winding (part 1)|last=edinburghcitylibraries|date=2016-06-07|website=Tales of One City|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1918, Ethel embarked on a second tour of duty with the Scottish Women's Hospital.

'''Ezekiel, Freiherr von Spanheim''' (also Ézéchiel, and known as Baron Spanheim) (7 December 1629 – 7 November 1710) was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] diplomat and scholar.

[[File:Ezechiel Spanheim.jpg|thumb|Ezechiel Spanheim, 1702 engraving by [[Robert White (engraver)|Robert White]].]]

==Life==
He was born at [[Geneva]], the eldest son of [[Friedrich Spanheim the Elder]]. After 1642 he studied philology and theology at the [[University of Leyden]], and in 1650 returned to Geneva to be Professor of Rhetoric at Geneva.

In 1656 Spanheim became tutor to the son of [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]]. Political theory led him into a diplomatic career. The Elector sent him in 1661 to Rome to investigate intrigues of the Roman Catholic Electors. After his return in 1665 the Elector employed him as ambassador at various courts, finally in England where after 1679 he was charged also with the affairs of the [[Elector of Brandenburg]]. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1679.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27spanheim%27%29| title = Library and Archive catalogue| publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1680 he entered the service of electoral Brandenburg as minister of state. As ambassador of the [[Great Elector]] he spent nine years at the court of Paris, and subsequently devoted some years to studies in [[Berlin]]; but after the [[Peace of Ryswick]] in 1697 he returned as ambassador to France where he remained until 1702.

In 1702, he went on his final diplomatic mission, as first [[Prussian]] ambassador to England. He died in London in 1710 and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/ezekiel-spanheim&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Acta Eruditorum - I monete, 1707 – BEIC 13369403.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1. Illustration of critique of ''Dissertationes de praestantia...'' published in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1707]]
His major works are ''Disputationes de usu et præstantia numismatum antiquorum'' (Rome, 1664; in 2 vols., London and Amsterdam, 1706–17) and ''Orbis Romanus'' (London, 1704; Halle, 1738), which [[Edward Gibbon]] used as a source for his monumental [[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]. He also edited with [[Petavius]] the ''Opera'' of [[Cyril of Alexandria]] and of the [[Emperor Julian]] (Leipzig, 1696).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2821">The office of the '''Federal [[Chief information security officer|Chief Information Security Officer of the United States]]''' (CISO) was created on September 8 2016.
The role of the CISO is to guide cybersecurity policy, planning, and implementation in the [[U.S. Federal Government]].&lt;ref name="whann" &gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Scott, J. Michael Daniel|title=Announcing the First Federal Chief Information Security Officer|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/09/08/announcing-first-federal-chief-information-security-officer|website=[[WhiteHouse.gov]]|publisher=White House|date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The first appointment to this position was [[Gregory Touhill]].

The CISO position is in the [[Office of Management and Budget]] reporting to the [[Federal Chief Information Officer of the United States|U.S. Chief Information Officer]].  An acting deputy reports to the CISO.&lt;ref name="whann"/&gt;

Having a CISO or the equivalent function in the organization has become a standard in business, government, and non-profit sectors. Throughout the world, a growing number of organizations have a CISO. By 2009, approximately 85% of large organizations had a security executive, up from 56% in 2008, and 43% in 2006. In 2011, in a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers for their Annual Information Security Survey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Information Security Survey|publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate={{date|2012-05-27}}|url=http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/information-security-survey|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503152607/http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/information-security-survey|archivedate=2012-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of businesses had a CISO or equivalent. About one-third of these security chiefs report to a [[Chief Information Officer]]  (CIO), 35% to [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO), and 28% to the board of directors.

In corporations, the trend is for CISOs to have a strong balance of business acumen and technology knowledge. CISOs are often in high demand and compensation is comparable to other C-level positions who also hold a similar [[corporate title]].

Independent organizations such as [[Holistic Information Security Practitioner]] Institute (HISPI) and [[EC-Council]] provide training, education and certification by promoting a holistic approach to Cybersecurity to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), Information Security Officers (ISOs), Information Security Managers, Directors of Information Security, Security Analysts, Security Engineers and Technology Risk Managers from major corporations and organizations.

The '''Jackie Chan Stunt Team''' ({{zh|t=成家班|cy=Sing Ga Ban|l=Chan's Family Group}}), also known as '''Jackie Chan's Stuntmen Association''' is a group of [[stunt double|stuntmen]] and [[martial arts|martial artists]] who work alongside [[Jackie Chan]].

==History==
The JC Stunt Team was established in 1976 and originated from the relationships Chan formed in his early starring roles in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action movies]]. Several of his co-stars and stuntmen hired by the [[movie studio|film studios]] began working together regularly. This engendered a familiarity of one another's skills and abilities and it made sense for them to become a working team. Some of the members had received training at the [[Peking Opera school]]s, similar to Chan.

By 1983, and the release of the film ''[[Project A]]'', the stunt team had become an official organisation of 6 members. The organisation meant that the stuntmen not only received [[Insurance|insurance coverage]], but also a monthly salary and higher pay.
By the time of ''[[Police Story 2]]'' in 1988, the team had expanded to around 20 members.
This incarnation of the team was disbanded in 1990 and thereafter, individual members were contracted and used on a film-by-film basis rather than all members remaining on the payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for some new faces, and the return of former members.

The formation of Chan's team influenced others in the [[Film industry|business]] to follow suit, particularly his former co-stars and "brothers" [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]] (their stunt teams known as "Hung Ga Ban" and "Yuen Ga Ban" respectively). Other actors who formed their own stunt teams include [[Lau Kar-leung]], [[Philip Ko]], [[Stanley Tong]] and [[Bruce Law]].
Chan's stunt team worked in collaboration with Sammo Hung's team on films including [[Thunderbolt (1995 film)|Thunderbolt]] and [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]].
A small number of films that Chan produced but did not appear in, or was not involved in at all, have utilised his stunt team. These include ''The Gold Hunters'' (1981), ''[[Rouge (film)|Rouge]]'' (1988), ''The Inspector Wears Skirts 2'' (1989), ''Stage Door Johnny'' (1990) and ''Angry Ranger'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He was also a rabbi of [[Beth El Congregation (Baltimore, Maryland)|Beth El Congregation]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and a promoter of interfaith communication, which he referred to as "dialogue" or "trialogue."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/30/obituaries/jacob-b-agus.html Jacob B. Agus]". ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 30, 1986. Accessed April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JTSPapers&gt;[http://www.jtsa.edu/Library/Collections/Archives/The_Ratner_Center/Papers_of_Conservative_Rabbis_and_Synagogues/Agus_Jacob.xml Jacob Agus (1911–1986), Papers], [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]. Accessed April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agus (the family name was originally Agushewitz), was born in Poland in 1911 and his family emigrated to the United States in 1927. He attended the [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy|Talmudic Academy]], New York, graduating in 1929, received his BA from [[Yeshiva College (Yeshiva University)|Yeshiva College]] in 1933, and received [[semicha]] by [[Moshe Soloveichik]] at the [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] of [[Yeshiva University]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Steven T. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OaKPEfOEUdAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39 "American Rabbi"], via [[Google Books]], [[New York University Press]], 1997
{{ISBN|0-8147-4693-4}}. Accessed April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 he received a PhD in Jewish Thought from [[Harvard University]] and married Miriam Shore the same year.&lt;ref name=JTSPapers/&gt; His older brother was Irving A. Agus, who taught medieval Jewish History at Yeshiva University.

Agus's rabbinic career included Congregation Beth Abraham, [[Norfolk, Virginia]], 1934–1936; Temple Ashkenaz, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], 1936–1940; Agudas Achim North Shore Congregation, [[Chicago]], 1940–1942; and Beth Abraham United Synagogue Center, [[Dayton, Ohio]], 1942–1950. In 1945, Agus formally affiliated with the Conservative movement by joining the Rabbinical Assembly. In 1950 he became the rabbi of Beth El Congregation in Baltimore, where he remained for thirty years, retiring in 1980.&lt;ref name=JTSPapers/&gt;

As an influential member of the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly, where he was active in the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, chaired the Prayer Book Committee (1952–1956) and worked to define Conservative Jewish ideology through a series of conferences, committees and other gatherings, including the Continuing Conference on Conservative Ideology (1956–1963). With Morris Adler and Theodore Friedman he co-authored the 1950 ''Responsum on the Sabbath'' that allowed Conservative Jews to use electricity and drive on the Sabbath.

For more details of his role, see [[Conservative Halakha]] and [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]]

He taught at the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]], [[St. Mary's Seminary and University|St. Mary's Seminary and Ecumenical Institute]] (where he was also a founder of the Interfaith Roundtable), and at both [[Temple University]] and [[Dropsie College]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=JTSPapers/&gt;

In 1965 Agus accepted an invitation to teach at the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamerico in [[Buenos Aires]]. He remained in Argentina for two months, then traveled to Brazil where he spent two weeks lecturing under the auspices of the American Jewish Committee and the Brazilian Institute for Culture and Information. In Latin America Agus developed continuing ties with students and colleagues – among them [[Marshall Meyer]], then director of the Seminario. These ties are documented by correspondence in this collection.&lt;ref name=JTSPapers/&gt;

In addition to his rabbinical and scholarly work, Agus adopted the cause of interfaith and interracial relations, dubbing his forays into Jewish/Christian and Jewish/Christian/Muslim relations "dialogue" and "trialogue." He also served on the boards of the Baltimore National Council on Christians and Jews, and the predominantly African-American Morgan State University, also in Baltimore.&lt;ref name=JTSPapers/&gt;

Professor Steven Katz has summed up his work as follows: "a remarkable American Rabbi and scholar, illuminating Agus' commitment to Jewish people everywhere, his profound and unwavering spirituality, his continual reminders of the very real dangers of pseudo-Messianism and misplaced romantic zeal, and his willingness to take politically and religiously unpopular stands."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyupress.org/books/American_Rabbi-products_id-40.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interfaith==

Agus was one of the principal theologians of the American Jewish-Christian dialogue. He developed a [[Dual-covenant theology|dual covenant theory]] based on the thought of [[Franz Rosenzweig]]. He envisioned a symbiosis of the two religions.&lt;ref&gt;Agus, ''Dialogue and Tradition; The Challenges of Contemporary Judeo-Christian Thought'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rosenzweig’s view was remarkable, in that, the Christian community  was engaged in fulfilling Israel’s mission. The people Israel are like the sun; the Christian community was the effluence of Divine rays permeating the nations with the spirit of monotheism. The boundary line between Judaism and Christianity was not along the plane of intellectual thought, since the divine being could only be caught figuratively or symbolically within the meshes of human reason.&lt;ref&gt;Agus, ''Dialogue and Tradition; The Challenges of Contemporary Judeo-Christian Thought'', 492–493.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Bible is God-given, it follows that both Israel and Christendom, which are based on the Bible, are divinely ordained religious communities; in both these groups there is an eternal “we” which through common prayer for the Kingdom, acquires eternity for its members and also hastens the final redemption of the world….both are, in a real sense, revealed religions and each one, in itself, is only part of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Agus, ''Modern Philosophies of Judaism'', 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Modern philosophies==

Agus presented Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] as a paradigm of a modern Jew, despite the latter's [[kabbalah]], and fundamentalist [[halacha]]. Agus saw him as sanctifying modern change.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, American Rabbi, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Arnold Colescott''' (January 11, 1897 – January 11, 1950) was an American who was [[Imperial Wizard]] of the [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]]. Under financial pressure from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) for [[back taxes]], he disbanded the second wave of the original [[Ku Klux Klan]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], to Frank Colescott and Minnie Minnie Olive Acuff on January 11, 1897. He graduated from the veterinary college in Terre Haute and worked as a [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]]. He joined the local Ku Klux Klan chapter in [[Vigo County, Indiana]], and in sixteen years moved through the ranks up to the [[Ku Klux Klan titles and vocabulary#Second Era|Imperial Wizard]].&lt;ref&gt;Roznowski, Tom (2009). ''An American Hometown Terre Haute, Indiana, 1927''. Bloomington: [[Indiana University Press]]. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Colescott died on January 11, 1950, at age 53 in [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities|U.S. Veterans' Hospital]] in [[Coral Gables, Florida]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr. Colescott Dies.

His age was 53. ... |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 13, 1950 |access-date= February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial Wizard==
[[Ku Klux Klan titles and vocabulary#Second Era|Imperial Wizard]] [[Hiram Wesley Evans]] resigned on June 10, 1939,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;Atkins, Steven E. (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=X7ad8GzRf0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22James%20A.%20Colescott%22&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Right-Wing Extremism In Modern American History]''. [[ABC-CLIO]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Colescott became the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s new leader. He had previously served as [[chief of staff]] under Evans. Hiram Evans was effectively forced to quit, as his renouncement of [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|Anti-Catholicism]] had proven unpopular with "rank-and-file Klansmen". He resigned in favor of Colescott, who was soon officially initiated as the Imperial Wizard. The initiation ceremony was held in the Dixie Ball Room of the [[Henry Grady Hotel]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt; There were rumors that Evans sold control of the Klan to Colescott in a regular [[buyout]]. The alleged transaction of $220,000 between the two men remains unconfirmed.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt; Colescott and [[Samuel Green (Ku Klux Klan)|Samuel Green]] did however purchase the ownership of the Klan's headquarters in Atlanta, which they renamed to the Imperial Palace.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt;

===Pre-war reorganization efforts===
In his new role, Colescott had "initiated several property sales" to raise money for the Klan.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt;{{rp|79–83}} He personally led efforts to reorganize the Klan, and toured the [[Northern United States]], the [[Midwestern United States]], and the state of [[Florida]] in attempts to appeal to a wider audience. Chester L. Quarles, a professor of criminal justice at the [[University of Mississippi]], points that Colescott had considerable experience as a Klan recruiter across several states. He views Colescott as having good organizational skills, but leaving much to be desired as a [[public speaking|public speaker]]. Some Klan leaders employed glad-handing as a strategy, but Colescott was not among them.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt; His tours were met with suspicion and hostility in the Midwestern United States, including his native [[Indiana]]. In the 1920s, the Klan in this region was led by [[D. C. Stephenson]], whose term ended with a major scandal and his conviction for murder. This and other cases of "Klan corruption" had left the organization with a decidedly negative reputation among Mid-westerners.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt;

Overall, Colescott was unable to stop the exodus of members due to the [[Great Depression]].  Lowering the initiation fee from $10 to $6 and providing cheaper robes for new recruits for $3.50 instead of $6.50 did not yield much results.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton, Michael (2010). ''The Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi A History''. Jefferson, N.C.: [[McFarland &amp; Company]] pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
The decline continued during [[World War II]], when most of the Americans began being preoccupied with the issues of national security and Ku Klax Klan "lost social influence, money and political support".&lt;ref name="Quarles"&gt;Quarles, Chester L. (1999). ''The Ku Klux Klan and Related American Racialist and Antisemitic Organizations: A History and Analysis''. Jefferson, N.C.: [[McFarland &amp; Company]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}} The Klan's association with [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizer organizations, such as the [[German American Bund]], and with the [[Detroit race riot of 1943]] were detrimental to the organization's public image: a substantial number of Klansmen stopped attending meetings and paying their dues.&lt;ref name="Quarles" /&gt;{{rp|78}}

Since the late 1930s, there were recurring reports of Klansmen involved in [[Flagellation|floggings]], [[kidnapping]]s, and [[murder]]s. The incidents seemed to be sporadic rather than part of a systematic campaign. Trying to build a positive public perception of the Klan, Colescott announced to the press that he was "against flogging, lynchings, or intimidations",&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; and also had pro-Bund [[Arthur Hornbui Bell]] removed as head of the [[New Jersey]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jersey Klan Leader Doubts His Dismissal.

====Dies Committee hearing====
In January 1942, Colescott was questioned by the Dies Committee, precursor to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee#Dies Committee (1938–1944)|House Un-American Activities Committee]], headed by [[Martin Dies Jr.]] (D-TX). Colescott was criticized by Dies for the Klan's alleged anti-Catholicism.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; During the hearing, committee members [[John E. Rankin]] (D-MS) and [[Joe Starnes]] (D-AL) defended Ku Klux Klan as an "American institution".&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt; The Dies Committee questioned Colescott about the connection of the Klan to violence. He claimed that [[terrorism]] was actually against the principles of the Klan, and that the so-called or alleged ''Klansmen'' behind these acts were former members, extremists, which the Klan had purged from its ranks.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt; He also testified to the Committee concerning the then-current status of the Klan in terms of membership and finances. There were reportedly less than 10,000 registered members of the Klan. In the financial year 1941, the Klan had only collected $10,000 from initiation fees and other dues.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt;

===Legal troubles===
In April 1944, the IRS filed a lien for $685,305 in unpaid taxes, penalties and interest from 1920s against the Klan. The special [[Ku Klux Klan titles and vocabulary#Second Era|Klonvocation]] convened by Colescott decided to dissolve the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Klan Disbands as National Body. Claimed 5,000,000 Roll in 1920s. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1944/06/05/archives/klan-disbands-as-national-body-claimed-5000000-roll-in-1920s.html |quote=The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a hooded order which in the early Nineteen Twenties claimed 5,100,000 members, has disbanded as a national group, The Atlanta Journal said last night. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 5, 1944 |access-date= February 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Ralph (1963). ''The South and the Southerner''. Boston: [[Little, Brown]]. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Before formally stepping down on April 23, 1944,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia" /&gt; he founded a provisional governing committee consisted of five members.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Michael (2010). ''The Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi A History''. Jefferson, N.C.: [[McFarland &amp; Company]] p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, the final Klonvocation gathering was held in Atlanta. Its decisions disbanded the central Klan organization, "repealed all degrees, vacated all offices, voided all charters, and relieved every Klansman of any obligation whatever". Local chapters could, however, continue their activities, now acting independently from each other. The final Klonvocation called for them to act in an "informal, unincorporated alliance".&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt;

===After disbanding===
Most of the local chapters in the South, or klaverns, continued to operate, thus staging the Klan's comeback and third re-organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/ReportOnTheKuKluxKlan_708 | title=Report on the Ku Klux Klan | publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League|Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith]], New York | access-date= July 25, 2013 |author1=Forster, Arnold |author2=Epstein, Benjamin R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of [[Samuel Green (Ku Klux Klan)|Samuel Green]], an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] [[obstetrician]], in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://theuka.us/Klan_Archives.html | title=Klan archives: Klankraft and Klan history | access-date=July 25, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831171417/http://www.theuka.us/Klan_Archives.html | archivedate=August 31, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Already in November 1944, anthropologist H. Scudder Mekeel had expressed concerns that the end of World War II could be followed by a "revival in full force" of the Klan.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt; Meanwhile, Colescott retired to [[Miami]]. He remained bitter about his forced retirement, and blamed "[[Nigger#Derivations|nigger-lover]]" [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and "that Jew" [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] for the downfall of the Klan.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt; In his final statement, Colescott declared, {{quote|We had to sell out our asserts, turn the proceeds over to the government, and go out of business. Maybe the government can make something of the Klan – I never could.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Steven E. (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=X7ad8GzRf0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22James%20A.%20Colescott%22&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Right-Wing Extremism in Modern American History]''.

'''Sir James Chadwick''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|CH|FRS}} (20 October 1891&amp;nbsp;– 24 July 1974) was a British [[physicist]] who was awarded the 1935 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his [[discovery of the neutron]] in 1932. In 1941, he wrote the final draft of the [[MAUD Committee|MAUD Report]], which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious [[atomic bomb]] research efforts. He was the head of the British team that worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] during the Second World War. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in Britain in 1945 for his achievements in physics.

Chadwick graduated from the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in 1911, where he studied under [[Ernest Rutherford]] (known as the "father of nuclear physics").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ernest Rutherford |url=http://www.orcbs.msu.edu/radiation/resources_links/historical_figures/rutherford.htm |work=Figures in Radiation History |publisher=[[Michigan State University]] |accessdate=3 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629192822/http://www.orcbs.msu.edu/radiation/resources_links/historical_figures/rutherford.htm |archivedate=29 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Manchester, he continued to study under Rutherford until he was awarded his MSc in 1913. The same year, Chadwick was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]]. He elected to study [[beta radiation]] under [[Hans Geiger]] in Berlin. Using Geiger's recently developed [[Geiger counter]], Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a [[Beta decay#Beta emission spectrum|continuous spectrum]], and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when the First World War broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the [[Ruhleben internment camp]].

After the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where Chadwick earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree under Rutherford's supervision from [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like [[John Cockcroft]], [[Norman Feather]], and [[Mark Oliphant]]. Chadwick followed his discovery of the [[neutron]] by measuring its [[mass]]. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the [[University of Liverpool]], where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a [[cyclotron]], made it an important centre for the study of [[nuclear physics]].

During the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the [[Tube Alloys]] project to build an atomic bomb, while his Liverpool lab and environs were harassed by [[Luftwaffe]] bombing. When the [[Quebec Agreement]] merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]] For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the [[1945 New Year Honours|New Year Honours on 1 January 1945]]. In July 1945, he viewed the [[Trinity nuclear test]]. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward [[Big Science]], Chadwick became the [[Master (college)|Master]] of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.

== Education and early life ==
James Chadwick was born in [[Bollington]], [[Cheshire]], on 20 October 1891,{{sfn|Falconer|2004}}{{sfn|Oliphant|1974}} the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, a cotton spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a domestic servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to [[Manchester]], leaving him in the care of his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to [[Manchester Grammar School]], which his family had to turn down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the [[Central Grammar School for Boys]] in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=3–5}}&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt;

Chadwick chose to attend [[Victoria University of Manchester]], which he entered in 1908. He meant to study mathematics, but enrolled in [[physics]] by mistake. Like most students, he lived at home, walking the {{convert|4|miles}} to the university and back each day. At the end of his first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by [[Ernest Rutherford]], who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of {{convert|1|g}} of [[radium]], a unit of measurement which would become known as the [[curie]]. Rutherford's suggested approach was unworkable—something Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford—so Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick's first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford, was published in 1912.{{sfn|Rutherford|Chadwick|1912}} He graduated with [[first class honours]] in 1911.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=6–14}}

Having devised a means of measuring gamma radiation, Chadwick proceeded to measure the absorption of gamma rays by various gases and liquids. This time the resulting paper was published under his name alone. He was awarded his [[Master of Science]] (MSc) degree in 1912, and was appointed a Beyer Fellow. The following year he was awarded an [[1851 Exhibition Scholarship]], which allowed him to study and research at a university in continental Europe. He elected to go to the [[Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt]] in Berlin in 1913, to study [[beta radiation]] under [[Hans Geiger]].{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=16–21}} Using Geiger's recently developed [[Geiger counter]], which provided more accuracy than the earlier photographic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation did not produce [[spectral lines|discrete lines]], as has been previously thought, but rather a [[Beta decay#Beta emission spectrum|continuous spectrum]] with peaks in certain regions.{{sfn|Chadwick|1914}}{{sfn|Chadwick|Ellis|1922}}{{sfn|Weiner|1969}}{{sfn|Jensen|2000|pp=88–90}} On a visit to Geiger's laboratory, [[Albert Einstein]] told Chadwick that: "I can explain either of these things, but I can't explain them both at the same time."{{sfn|Weiner|1969}} The continuous spectrum would remain an [[Beta decay#History|unexplained phenomenon for many years]].{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=24–26}}

Chadwick was still in Germany at the start of the [[First World War]], and was interned in the [[Ruhleben internment camp]] near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as [[radioactive quackery|radioactive toothpaste]].&lt;ref name=APSNews&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title= This Month in Physics History: May 1932: Chadwick reports the discovery of the neutron |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200705/physicshistory.cfm |journal=[[APS News]] |volume=16 |issue=5 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of [[Charles Drummond Ellis]], he worked on the [[ionisation]] of [[phosphorus]], and the [[mechanistic organic photochemistry|photochemical reaction]] of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[chlorine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Sir James Chadwick |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=25 July 1974 |page=20, column F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Sir Charles Ellis |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=15 January 1980 |page=14, column F}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released after the [[Armistice with Germany]] came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents' home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=39}}

Rutherford gave Chadwick a part-time teaching position at Manchester, allowing him to continue research.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=39}} He looked at the [[nuclear charge]] of [[platinum]], [[silver]], and [[copper]], and experimentally found that this was the same as the [[atomic number]] within an error of less than 1.5 per cent.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=43}} In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) student at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the [[nuclear force|forces]] inside the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. His degree was awarded in June 1921.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=43–50}} In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=58}}

== Researcher ==
=== Cambridge ===
Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship expired in 1923, and he was succeeded by the Russian physicist [[Pyotr Kapitza]]. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]], Sir [[William Symington McCormick|William McCormick]] arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over the next few years these would include [[John Cockcroft]], [[Norman Feather]] and [[Mark Oliphant]], who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=73–76}}

[[File:The Cavendish Laboratory - geograph.org.uk - 631839.jpg|thumb|left|The Cavendish Laboratory was the home of some of the great discoveries in physics. It was founded in 1874 by the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]] (Cavendish was his family name), and its first professor was [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/history |title=The History of the Cavendish |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=15 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In 1925, Chadwick met Aileen Stewart-Brown, the daughter of a Liverpool stockbroker. The two were married in August 1925,{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=73–76}} with Kapitza as Best Man. The couple had twin daughters, Joanna and Judith, who were born in February 1927.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=85}}

In his research, Chadwick continued to probe the nucleus. In 1925, the concept of [[Spin (physics)|spin]] had allowed physicists to explain the [[Zeeman effect]], but it also created unexplained anomalies. At the time it was believed that the nucleus consisted of [[proton]]s and electrons, so [[nitrogen]]'s nucleus, for example, with a [[mass number]] of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right [[mass]] and charge, but the wrong spin.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=92–93}}

At a conference at Cambridge on beta particles and gamma rays in 1928, Chadwick met Geiger again. Geiger had brought with him a new model of his Geiger counter, which had been improved by his post-doctoral student [[Walther Müller]]. Chadwick had not used one since the war, and the new [[Geiger counter|Geiger–Müller counter]] was potentially a major improvement over the [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] techniques then in use at Cambridge, which relied on the human eye for observation. The major drawback with it was that it detected [[Alpha decay|alpha]], [[Beta particle|beta]] and [[Gamma ray|gamma]] radiation, and radium, which the Cavendish laboratory normally used in its experiments, emitted all three, and was therefore unsuitable for what Chadwick had in mind. However, [[polonium]] is an alpha emitter, and [[Lise Meitner]] sent Chadwick about 2 millicuries (about {{val|0.5|u=ug}}) from Germany.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=95–97}}{{sfn|Sublette|2006}}

In Germany, [[Walther Bothe]] and his student [[Herbert Becker (physicist)|Herbert Becker]] had used polonium to bombard [[beryllium]] with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this was evidence of something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the [[neutron]], a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=95–97}} Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Frédéric]] and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] had succeeded in knocking protons from [[paraffin wax]] using polonium and beryllium as a source for what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, [[Ettore Majorana]] came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=103–104}}

Chadwick dropped all his other responsibilities to concentrate on proving the existence of the neutron, assisted by Feather&lt;ref name="sessI"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Oral History interview transcript with Norman Feather, Session I | date= 25 February 1971 | publisher=American Institute of Physics, Niels Bohr Library and Archives | author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/4559-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an [[oscilloscope]].{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=103–104}}

[[File:Sir Ernest Rutherfords laboratory, early 20th century. (9660575343).jpg|thumb|right|Sir Ernest Rutherford's laboratory]]
In February 1932, after only about two weeks of experimentation with neutrons,&lt;ref name=APSNews /&gt; Chadwick sent a letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' titled "Possible Existence of a Neutron".{{sfn|Chadwick|1932a}} He communicated his findings in detail in an article sent to ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]'' titled "The Existence of a Neutron" in May.{{sfn|Chadwick|1932b}}{{sfn|Chadwick|1933}} His [[discovery of the neutron]] was a milestone in understanding the nucleus. Reading Chadwick's paper, [[Robert Bacher]] and [[Edward Condon]] realised that anomalies in the then-current theory, like the spin of nitrogen, would be resolved if the neutron has a [[spin-½|spin of 1/2]] and that a nitrogen nucleus consisted of seven protons and seven neutrons.{{sfn|Whaling|2009|pp=8–9}}{{sfn|Bacher|Condon|1932}}

The theoretical physicists [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] considered whether the neutron could be a fundamental [[nucleon|nuclear particle]] like the proton and electron, rather than a proton–electron pair.{{sfn|Heisenberg|1932a}}{{sfn|Heisenberg|1932b}}{{sfn|Heisenberg|1933}}{{sfn|Bromberg|1971}}  Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new nuclear particle,{{sfn|Heisenberg|1933}}{{sfn|Bromberg|1971}} but its exact nature remained unclear.  In his 1933 [[Bakerian Lecture]], Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about {{val|1.0067|ul=u}}. Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of {{val|1.0078|u=u}}, this implied the neutron as a proton–electron composite had a binding energy of about {{val|2|ul=MeV}}, which sounded reasonable,{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=115–116}} although it was hard to understand how a particle with so little binding energy could be stable.{{sfn|Bromberg|1971}}  Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933–4.  By bombarding [[boron]] with alpha particles, Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but [[Ernest Lawrence]]'s team at the [[University of California]] produced a small one.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=153–157}}  Then [[Maurice Goldhaber]], a refugee from [[Nazi Germany]] and a graduate student at the Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that [[deuteron]]s could be [[Photodisintegration|photodisintegrated]] by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Tl (then known as [[Decay chain#Thorium series|thorium C"]]):

|}
An accurate value for the mass of the neutron could be determined from this process. Chadwick and Goldhaber tried this and found that it worked.{{sfn|Goldhaber|1934}}{{sfn|Chadwick|Goldhaber|1934}}{{sfn|Chadwick|Goldhaber|1935}}  They measured the kinetic energy of the proton produced as 1.05 MeV, leaving the mass of the neutron as the unknown in the equation.  Chadwick and Goldhaber calculated that it was either 1.0084 or 1.0090 atomic units, depending on the values used for the masses of the proton and deuteron.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=122–125}}{{sfn|Chadwick|Goldhaber|1935}}  (The modern accepted value for the mass of the neutron is {{val|1.00866|ul=u}}.)  The mass of the neutron was too large to be a proton–electron pair.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=122–125}}

For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the [[Hughes Medal]] by the [[Royal Society]] in 1932, the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1935, the [[Copley Medal]] in 1950 and the [[Franklin Medal]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/chadwick-bio.html |title=James Chadwick – Biography |publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]] |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His discovery of the neutron made it possible to produce elements heavier than [[uranium]] in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by [[beta decay]]. Unlike the positively charged [[alpha particle]]s, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any [[Coulomb barrier]], and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired [[Enrico Fermi]] to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=125}}

[[Wolfgang Pauli]] proposed another kind of particle on 4 December 1930 in order to explain the continuous spectrum of beta radiation that Chadwick had reported in 1914. Since not all of the energy of beta radiation could be accounted for, the law of [[conservation of energy]] appeared to be violated, but Pauli argued that this could be redressed if another, undiscovered, particle was involved.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=119–120}} Pauli also called this particle a neutron, but it was clearly not the same particle as Chadwick's neutron. Fermi renamed it the [[neutrino]], Italian for "little neutron".{{sfn|Close|2012|pp=15–18}} In 1934, Fermi proposed his [[Fermi's interaction|theory of beta decay]] which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino.{{sfn|Fermi|1968}}{{sfn|Close|2012|pp=22–25}}  The neutrino could account for the missing energy, but a particle with little mass and no electric charge was difficult to observe. [[Rudolf Peierls]] and [[Hans Bethe]] calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, so the chances of detecting them were slim.{{sfn|Close|2012|pp=26–28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Neutrino |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |issn=0028-0836 |volume=133 |issue=3362 |pages=532–532 |date=7 April 1934 |doi=10.1038/133532a0 |bibcode = 1934Natur.133..532B |last1=Bethe |first1=H |last2=Peierls |first2=R }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Reines]] and [[Clyde Cowan]] would [[neutrino experiment|confirm the neutrino]] on 14 June 1956 by placing a detector within a large antineutrino flux from a nearby nuclear reactor.{{sfn|Close|2012|pp=37–41}}

=== Liverpool ===
With the onset of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom]], the government became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the [[cyclotron]], promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=129–132}}

[[File:Victoria Clock Tower, Liverpool University - geograph.org.uk - 374422.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"[[Red brick university|Red brick]]" [[Victoria Building, University of Liverpool|Victoria Building]] at the [[University of Liverpool]] ]]
Chadwick was himself a critic of [[Big Science]] in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the [[Solvay Conference]] in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment.{{sfn|Herken|2002|p=10}} While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium [[Nuclear fusion|fuses]] to form [[helium-3]], thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford [[particle accelerator]] was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.{{sfn|Heilbron|Seidel|1989|pp=165–167}}{{sfn|Oliphant|Rutherford|1933}}{{sfn|Oliphant|Kinsey|Rutherford|1933}}{{sfn|Oliphant|Harteck|Rutherford|1934}}

In March 1935, Chadwick received an offer of the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the [[University of Liverpool]], in his wife's home town, to succeed [[Lionel Wilberforce]]. The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on [[direct current]] electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university's prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick's Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=134–139}} His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Yahoo News |title=Sold!

Chadwick set about acquiring a cyclotron for Liverpool. He started by spending £700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at Liverpool, so some components could be made in-house.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=142}} He was able to persuade the university to provide £2,000 and obtained a grant for another £2,000 from the Royal Society.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=149–151}} To build his cyclotron, Chadwick brought in two young experts, Bernard Kinsey and Harold Walke, who had worked with Lawrence at the University of California. A local cable manufacturer donated the copper conductor for the coils. The cyclotron's 50-ton magnet was manufactured in [[Trafford Park]] by [[Metropolitan-Vickers]], which also made the vacuum chamber.{{sfn|Holt|1994}} The cyclotron was completely installed and running in July 1939. The total cost of £5,184 was more than Chadwick had received from the University and the Royal Society, so Chadwick paid the rest from his {{SEK|159,917|link=yes}} (£8,243) Nobel Prize money.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=173–174}}

At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked together closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes, and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer.{{sfn|King|1997}}{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=150}}

== Second World War ==
=== Tube Alloys and the MAUD Report ===
In Germany, [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] bombarded uranium with neutrons, and noted that [[barium]], a lighter element, was among the products produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew [[Otto Frisch]] astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=170}} They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called [[nuclear fission|fission]]. They calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 [[Electronvolt|MeV]], implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions,{{sfn|Meitner|Frisch|1939}} and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally.{{sfn|Frisch|1939}} It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible.{{sfn|Hahn|Strassmann|1939}} French scientists, [[Pierre Joliot]], [[Hans von Halban]] and [[Lew Kowarski]], soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission.{{sfn|von Halban|Joliot|Kowarski|1939}} In a paper co-authored with the American physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the [[uranium-235]] [[isotope]], which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=24–27}}{{sfn|Bohr|Wheeler|1939}}

[[File:William Penney, Otto Frisch, Rudolf Peierls and John Cockroft.jpg|thumb|right|Key British physicists. Left to right: [[William Penney]], [[Otto Frisch]], [[Rudolf Peierls]] and [[John Cockcroft]]. They are wearing the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]].]]
Chadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to [[Stockholm]] as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a [[tramp steamer]]. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found [[Joseph Rotblat]], a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=174–178}}

In October 1939, Chadwick received a letter from Sir [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]], the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an [[atomic bomb]]. Chadwick responded cautiously. He did not dismiss the possibility, but carefully went over the many theoretical and practical difficulties involved. Chadwick decided to investigate the properties of [[uranium oxide]] further with Rotblat.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=38–39}} In March 1940, Otto Frisch and [[Rudolf Peierls]] at the [[University of Birmingham]] re-examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the [[Frisch–Peierls memorandum]]. Instead of looking at uranium metal, they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but that it might require as little as {{convert|1|kg}} of uranium-235, and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=39–41}}

A special subcommittee of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), known as the [[MAUD Committee]], was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir [[George Paget Thomson|George Thomson]] and its original membership included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and [[Philip Moon]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=45}} While other teams investigated [[uranium enrichment]] techniques, Chadwick's team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the [[nuclear cross section]] of uranium-235.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=63}} By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the [[critical mass]] of uranium-235 might be {{convert|8|kg}} or less.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=206}} His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant [[Luftwaffe]] bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out so often that they were replaced by cardboard.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=204}}

In July 1941, Chadwick was chosen to write the final draft of the MAUD Report, which, when presented by [[Vannevar Bush]] to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour millions of dollars into the pursuit of an atomic bomb.{{sfn|Bundy|1988|pp=48–49}} When [[George B. Pegram]] and [[Harold Urey]] visited Britain to see how the project,{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=85}} now known as [[Tube Alloys]],{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=109}} was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: "I wish I could tell you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will."{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=85}}

In a recent book about the Bomb project, [[Graham Farmelo]] wrote that "Chadwick did more than any other scientist to give Churchill the Bomb.&amp;nbsp;... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point."{{sfn|Farmelo|2013|p=119}} So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that "a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action".{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=205}} Sir [[Hermann Bondi]] suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter's prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick's interest in "looking forward" to the Bomb's prospects.{{sfn|Bondi|1997}}

=== Manhattan Project ===
[[File:Quebec conference 1943.png|thumb|right|[[Mackenzie King]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|first Quebec Conference]] in 1943]]
Owing to the danger from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada as part of a [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|government evacuation scheme]].{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=197–198}} Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=218–219}} The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over £1 million and strain Britain's resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=141–142}} At the same time that the British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American [[Manhattan Project]] was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to utilise Chadwick's talents.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=152}}

The matter of cooperation had to be taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], and President Roosevelt negotiated the [[Quebec Agreement]], which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and [[Francis Simon|Simon]] were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir [[Wallace Akers]], to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new [[Combined Policy Committee]] to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, and the head of the British Mission.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=166–171}}

Leaving Rotblat in charge in Liverpool, Chadwick began a tour of the Manhattan Project facilities in November 1943, except for the [[Hanford Site]] where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man apart from Groves and his second in command to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the [[K-25]] [[gaseous diffusion]] facility at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=253}} In early 1944, he moved to [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=250–261}} For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=95}}

[[File:Groves and Chadwick 830308.jpg|thumb|left|Chadwick (left) with [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], the director of the [[Manhattan Project]]]]
Chadwick accepted that the Americans did not need British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with the director of the Manhattan Project, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=247–51}} He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=241–244}} As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.{{sfn|Szasz|1992|p=xvi}}

Although he had more knowledge of the project than anyone else from Britain,{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=329}} Chadwick had no access to the Hanford site. [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Lord Portal]] was offered a tour of Hanford in 1946. "This was the only plant to which Chadwick had been denied access in wartime, and now he asked Groves if he could accompany Portal. Groves replied that he could, but if he did then 'Portal will not see very much'."{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=317}} For his efforts, Chadwick received a [[knighthood]] in the [[1945 New Year Honours|New Year Honours on 1 January 1945]].&lt;ref name="Kt"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36866 |supp=y|page=1|date=29 December 1944}} ''Knight Bachelor''&lt;/ref&gt; He considered this to be a recognition of the work of the whole Tube Alloys project.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=279}}

By early 1945, Chadwick was spending most of his time in Washington, D.C., and his family relocated from Los Alamos to a house on Washington's [[Dupont Circle]] in April 1945.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=279}} He was present at the meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 4 July when [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] gave Britain's agreement to use the atomic bomb against Japan,{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=290}} and at the [[Trinity nuclear test]] on 16 July, when the first atomic bomb was detonated.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=292}} Inside its [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] was a polonium-beryllium [[modulated neutron initiator]], a development of the technique that Chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before.{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=287}} [[William L. Laurence]], the ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter attached to the Manhattan Project, wrote that "never before in history had any man lived to see his own discovery materialize itself with such telling effect on the destiny of man."{{sfn|Laurence|1946|p=26}}

== Later life ==
Shortly after the war ended, Chadwick was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy (ACAE). He was also appointed as the British scientific advisor to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]]. He clashed with fellow ACAE member [[Patrick Blackett]], who disagreed with Chadwick's conviction that Britain needed to acquire its own nuclear weapons; but it was Chadwick's position that was ultimately adopted. He returned to Britain in 1946, to find a country still beset by wartime rationing and shortages.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=306, 316}}

At this time, Sir James Mountford, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, wrote in his diary "he had never seen a man 'so physically, mentally and spiritually tired" as Chadwick, for he "had plumbed such depths of moral decision as more fortunate men are never called upon even to peer into&amp;nbsp;... [and suffered]&amp;nbsp;... almost insupportable agonies of responsibility arising from his scientific work'."{{sfn|Brown|1997|p=323}}

In 1948, Chadwick accepted an offer to become the [[Master (college)|Master]] of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the College, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He increased the number of research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=340–353}} This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist [[Tien-chin Tsao]]{{sfn|Zhang|2010}} and the Hungarian-born economist [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]]. In what became known as the Peasants' Revolt, fellows led by [[Patrick Hadley]] voted an old friend of Chadwick's off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick's were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that [[Francis Crick]], a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and [[James Watson]] discovered the structure of [[DNA]].{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=340–353}}

Over the years, Chadwick received many honours, including the [[Medal for Merit]] from the United States, and the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' from Germany.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=360–363}} He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1927,{{sfn|Massey|Feather|1976|p=11}} and in 1946 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00004579 |title=J. Chadwick (1891–1974) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a [[Companion of Honour]] in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1970 for "services to science",&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=44999 |supp=y|page=23|date=30 December 1969}} ''Companion of Honour''&lt;/ref&gt; and went to [[Buckingham Palace]] for the investiture ceremony. He became more frail, and seldom left his flat, although he travelled to Liverpool for celebrations of his eightieth birthday.  A lifelong atheist, he saw no reason to adopt religious faith in later life. He died in his sleep on 24 July 1974.{{sfn|Brown|1997|pp=360–363}} 

His papers are held at the [[Churchill Archives Centre]] in Cambridge, and are accessible to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FCHAD |title=The Papers of Sir James Chadwick |publisher=[[Janus (database)|Janus]] |accessdate=26 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chadwick Laboratory at the University of Liverpool is named after him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceplaces.org/liverpool/liverpool_list.html |title=Liverpool Science Places |publisher=Scienceplaces.org |accessdate=6 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815041701/http://www.scienceplaces.org/liverpool/liverpool_list.html |archivedate=15 August 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is its Sir James Chadwick Chair of Experimental Physics, which was named after him in 1991 as part of celebrations of the centenary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/commsec/calendar/University%20Chairs%20and%20their%20Holders%20Past%20and%20Present.pdf |title=University Chairs and their Holders Past and Present |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]] |accessdate=1 August 2014 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Chadwick (crater)|crater on the moon]] is also named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/1118?__fsk=1722400487 |title=Planetary Names: Crater, craters: Chadwick on Moon |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=12 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The James Chadwick Building, which houses part of the [[School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Sciences, University of Manchester]] is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceas.manchester.ac.uk/about-us/maps-and-travel/james-chadwick-building-directions/ |title=James Chadwick Building - directions |publisher=The University of Manchester |accessdate=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was described by the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] official historian [[Lorna Arnold]] as "a physicist, a scientist-diplomat, and a good, wise, and humane man."{{sfn|Arnold|1998}}

'''James Franck''' (26 August 1882 – 21 May 1964) was a [[Germans|German]] [[physicist]] who won the 1925 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] with [[Gustav Hertz]] "for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom".&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1925/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1925 |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=16 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He completed his [[doctorate]] in 1906 and his [[habilitation]] in 1911 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Frederick William University]] in Berlin, where he lectured and taught until 1918, having reached the position of [[Academic ranks in Germany|professor extraordinarius]]. He served as a volunteer in the German Army during [[World War I]]. He was seriously injured in 1917 in a gas attack and was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class.

Franck became the Head of the Physics Division of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft]] for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, Franck became [[professor ordinarius]] of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the [[University of Göttingen]]. While there he worked on [[quantum physics]] with [[Max Born]], who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the [[Franck–Hertz experiment]], an important confirmation of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]]. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably [[Lise Meitner]], [[Hertha Sponer]] and [[Hilde Levi]].

After the [[Nazi Party]] came to power in Germany in 1933, Franck resigned his post in protest against the dismissal of fellow academics. He assisted [[Frederick Lindemann]] in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933. After a year at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Denmark]], he moved to the United States, where he worked at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]] and then the [[University of Chicago]]. During this period he became interested in [[photosynthesis]].

Franck participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]] as Director of the Chemistry Division of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]]. He was also the chairman of the Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which is best known for the compilation of the [[Franck Report]], which recommended that the [[atomic bomb]]s not be used on the Japanese cities without warning.

==Early life==
James Franck was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany, on  26 August 1882, the second child and first son of Jacob Franck, a banker, and his wife Rebecca née Nachum Drucker.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=4}} He had an older sister, Paula, and a younger brother, Robert Bernard.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=8–11}} His father was a devout and religious man, while his mother came from a family of rabbis.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=4}} Franck attended primary school in Hamburg. Starting in 1891 he attended the [[Wilhelm-Gymnasium (Hamburg)|Wilhelm-Gymnasium]], which was then a boys-only school.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=8–11}}

Hamburg had no university then, so prospective students had to attend one of the 22 universities elsewhere in Germany. Intending to study law and economics, Franck entered the  [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1901, as it had a renowned law school.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=12–15}} He attended lectures on law, but was far more interested in those on science. While there, he met [[Max Born]], who would become a lifelong friend. With Born's help, he was able to persuade his parents to allow him to switch to studying physics and chemistry.{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=53–54}} Franck attended mathematics lectures by [[Leo Königsberger]] and [[Georg Cantor]], but Heidelberg was not strong on the physical sciences, so he decided to go to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Frederick William University]] in Berlin.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=12–15}}

At Berlin, Franck attended lectures by [[Max Planck]] and [[Emil Warburg]].{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=16–17}} On 28 July 1904 he saved a pair of children from drowning in the [[Spree River]].{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=16–17}} For his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Dir. Phil.) under Warburg's supervision,{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=5}} Warburg suggested that he study [[corona discharge]]s. Franck found this topic too complex, so he changed the focus of his [[thesis]].{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=54–55}} Entitled ''Über der Beweglichkeit Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung'' ("On the Mobility of [[Ion]]s"),{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=331}} it would subsequently be published in the ''[[Annalen der Physik]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Franck|first= J.|title=Über die Beweglichkeit der Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=326|number=15
|issn=1521-3889|doi=10.1002/andp.19063261508|pp=972–1000|year=1906|language=German|bibcode = 1906AnP...326..972F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his thesis completed, Franck had to perform his deferred military service. He was called up on 1 October 1906 and joined the 1st Telegraph Battalion. He suffered a minor horse riding accident in December and was discharged as unfit for duty. He took up an assistantship at the Physikalische Verein in [[Frankfurt]] in 1907, but did not enjoy it, and soon returned to Frederick William University.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=24–26}} At a concert Franck met Ingrid Josephson, a Swedish pianist. They were married in a Swedish ceremony in [[Gothenburg]] on 23 December 1907. They had two daughters, Dagmar (Daggie), who was born in 1909, and Elisabeth (Lisa), who was born in 1912.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=34–35}}

To pursue an academic career in Germany, having a doctorate was not enough; one needed a ''[[venia legendi]]'', or habilitation. This could be achieved with either another major thesis or by producing a substantial body of published work. Franck chose the latter route. There were many unsolved problems in physics at the time, and by 1914 he had published 34 articles. He was the sole author of some, but generally preferred working in collaboration with [[Eva von Bahr (physicist)|Eva von Bahr]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Robert Pohl]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Peter Pringsheim|de}}, [[Robert W. Wood]], [[Arthur Wehnelt]] or [[Wilhelm Westphal]]. His most fruitful collaboration was with [[Gustav Hertz]], with whom  he wrote 19 articles. He received his habilitation on 20 May 1911.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=24–31}}

==Franck–Hertz experiment==
{{main|Franck–Hertz experiment}}
[[Image:Franck-Hertz en.svg|thumb|right|Anode current (arbitrary units) versus grid voltage (relative to the cathode). This graph is based on the original 1914 paper by Franck and Hertz. |alt=Graph. The vertical axis is labelled "current", and ranges from 0 to 300 in arbitrary units. The horizontal axis is labelled "voltage", and ranges from 0 to 15&amp;nbsp;volts.]]
In 1914, Franck teamed up with Hertz to perform an experiment to investigate [[fluorescence]]. They designed a [[vacuum tube]] for studying energetic [[electron]]s that flew through a thin vapour of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9&amp;nbsp;[[electron volt]]s) of its [[kinetic energy]] before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely the same amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=55–56}}&lt;ref name=FH1&gt;{{cite journal | first1=J. |last1=Franck |first2=G. |last2=Hertz |authorlink2=Gustav Hertz |title = Über Zusammenstöße zwischen Elektronen und Molekülen des Quecksilberdampfes und die Ionisierungsspannung desselben |language=German |trans-title=On the collisions between electrons and molecules of mercury vapor and the ionization potential of the same |journal = Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft | year = 1914 | volume = 16 | pages = 457–467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These experimental results provided confirmation of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[photoelectric effect]] and Planck's relation (E = fh) linking energy (E) and frequency (f) arising from quantisation of energy with [[Planck's constant]] (h). But they also provided evidence supporting the [[Bohr model|model of the atom]] that had been proposed the previous year by [[Niels Bohr]]. Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom's "quantum energy levels". Before a collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9&amp;nbsp;electron volts (eV) more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities.{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=55–56}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Franck and Hertz versus Townsend: A Study of Two Types of Experimental Error |first=Giora |last=Hon |journal=[[Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pp=79–106 |jstor=27757636 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a second paper presented in May 1914, Franck and Hertz reported on the light emission by the mercury atoms that had absorbed energy from collisions. They showed that the [[wavelength]] of this [[ultraviolet]] light corresponded exactly to the 4.9&amp;nbsp;eV of energy that the flying electron had lost.

==World War I==
Franck enlisted in the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] soon after the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914. In December he was sent to the [[Picardy]] sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He became a deputy officer (''[[offizierstellvertreter]]''), and then a lieutenant (''[[leutnant]]'') in 1915.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=52–58}} In early 1915 he was transferred to [[Fritz Haber|Fritz Haber's]] new unit that would introduce clouds of chlorine gas as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Kloot|first1=W.|title=April 1918: Five Future Nobel prize-winners inaugurate weapons of mass destruction and the academic-industrial-military complex|journal=Notes Rec.

He was awarded the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class, on 30 March 1915,&lt;ref name="Papers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.FRANCK |title=Guide to the James Franck Papers 1882–1966 |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |accessdate=18 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city of Hamburg awarded him the [[Hanseatic Cross]] on 11 January 1916.&lt;ref name="Papers" /&gt; While in hospital with [[pleurisy]], he co-wrote yet another scientific paper with Hertz, and he was appointed an assistant professor in his absence by Frederick William University on 19 September 1916.  Sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Russian front]], he came down with [[dysentery]]. He returned to Berlin, where he joined Hertz,  Westphal, [[Hans Geiger]], Otto Hahn and others at  Haber's [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry]], working on the development of [[gas masks]].{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=52–58}} He was awarded the  Iron Cross, First Class, on 23 February 1918. He was discharged from the Army on 25 November 1918, soon after the war ended.&lt;ref name="Papers" /&gt;

With the war over, Haber's Kaiser Wilhelm Institute now returned to research, and Haber offered Franck a job. His new post came with more pay, but was not a tenured position. It did however allow Franck to pursue his research as he wished. Working with new, younger collaborators such as [[Walter Grotrian]], Paul Knipping, Thea Krüger, [[Fritz Reiche]] and [[Hertha Sponer]], his first papers at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute examined atomic electrons in their excited state, results that would later prove important in the development of the [[laser]].{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=61–64}} They coined the term "[[metastable]]" for atoms spending an extended time in a state other than [[ground state|that of least energy]].{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=57–58}} When Niels Bohr visited Berlin in 1920, Meitner and Franck arranged for him to come to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to talk with the younger staff without the presence of the ''bonzen'' ("bigwigs").{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=70–71}}

==Göttingen==
[[File:Franckfeier 1923 Die Bonzen.jpg|thumb|left|''Die Bonzen'', left to right: {{Interlanguage link multi|Max Reich|de}}, [[Max Born]], James Franck and [[Robert Pohl]] in 1923]]
In 1920, the [[University of Göttingen]] offered Max Born its chair of theoretical physics, which had recently been vacated by [[Peter Debye]]. Göttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to [[David Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and [[Carl Runge]], but not so much for physics. This would change. As part of his price for coming to Göttingen, Born wanted Franck to head experimental physics there. On 15 November 1920, Franck became Professor of Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics, a fully tenured ''professor ordinarius''. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought [[Hertha Sponer]] with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions. Pohl, a gifted teacher, headed the First Institute, and handled the lectures.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=75–79}}&lt;ref name="Nobel bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1925/franck-bio.html |title= James Franck – Biographical |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=16 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Franck refurbished the laboratory with the latest equipment using funds from his own pocket.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=7}}

Under Born and Franck, Göttingen was one of the world's great centres for physics between 1920 and 1933.&lt;ref name="Nobel bio"/&gt;{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=7}} Although they published only three papers together, Born and Franck discussed every one of their papers with each other. Gaining admittance to Franck's laboratory  became highly competitive. His doctoral students included [[Hans Kopfermann]], [[Arthur R. von Hippel]], [[Wilhelm Hanle]], [[Fritz Houtermans]], [[Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn|Heinrich Kuhn]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Werner Kroebel|de}}, Walter Lochte-Holtgreven and [[Heinz Maier-Leibnitz]].{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=58–59}} In supervising doctoral candidates, Franck had to ensure that thesis topics were well-defined, and would teach the candidate how to conduct original research, while still staying within the limits of the candidate's ability, the laboratory's equipment and the institute's budget.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=90}} Under his direction, research was carried out into the structure of atoms and molecules.{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=62–63}}

In his own research, Franck developed what became known as the [[Franck–Condon principle]], a rule in [[spectroscopy]] and [[quantum chemistry]] that explains the intensity of  [[vibronic transition]]s, simultaneous changes in electronic and vibrational energy levels of a molecule due to the absorption or emission of a [[photon]] of the appropriate energy. The principle states that during an [[electronic transition]], a change from one [[quantum vibration|vibrational]] [[energy level]] to another will be more likely to happen if the two vibrational [[wave functions]] overlap more significantly.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|pp=8–9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Franck |first=J. | date = 1926 | title = Elementary processes of photochemical reactions | journal = Transactions of the [[Faraday Society]] | volume = 21 | pages = 536–542 | doi = 10.1039/tf9262100536
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has since been applied to a wide variety of related phenomena.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|pp=9–11}}

==Exile==
This period came to an end when the [[Nazi Party]] won power in Germany in [[German federal election, March 1933|an election]] on 2 March 1933. The following month it enacted the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], which provided for the retirement or dismissal of all Jewish civil servants, along with political opponents of the government. As a veteran of the First World War, Franck was exempt, but he submitted his resignation anyway on 17 April 1933.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=188–194}} He once commented that science was his God and nature was his religion. He did not require his daughters to attend religious instruction classes at school,&lt;ref name="David Nachmansohn 1979 62"&gt;{{harvnb|Nachmansohn|1979|p=62|quote=James Franck was born in Hamburg ... As he said, science was his God and nature his religion. He did not insist that his daughters attend religious instruction classes (Religionsunterricht) in school. But he was very proud of his Jewish heritage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even let them have a decorated tree at Christmas;{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=132}} but he was proud of his Jewish heritage all the same.&lt;ref name="David Nachmansohn 1979 62"/&gt; He was the first academic to resign in protest over the law.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=12}} Newspapers around the world reported it, but no government or university  protested.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=197}}

Franck assisted [[Frederick Lindemann]] in helping dismissed Jewish scientists find work overseas, before he left Germany in November 1933.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=203–204}}  After a brief visit to the United States, where he measured the absorption of light in [[heavy water]] with Wood at [[Johns Hopkins University]], he took up a position at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]].{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=209–214}} He needed a new collaborator, so he took on [[Hilde Levi]], whose recent thesis had impressed him.{{sfn|Schweber|2012|p=276}} His original intention was to continue his research into the fluorescence of vapours and liquids, but under Bohr's influence they began to take an interest in biological aspects of these reactions, particularly [[photosynthesis]], the process by which plants use light to convert [[carbon dioxide]] and water into more organic compounds. Biological processes turned out to be far more complicated than simple reactions in atoms and molecules. He co-authored two papers with Levi on the subject, which he would return to over the following years.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=209–214}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Franck found a position at the ''[[Technical University of Denmark|Polytekniske Læreanstalt]]'' in Copenhagen for Arthur von Hippel, who was now his son in law, having married his daughter Dagmar. He decided to provide financial security for his children by dividing his Nobel Prize money between them. The gold medal itself was entrusted to Niels Bohr for safekeeping.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=218–219}} When Germany [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invaded Denmark]] on 9 April 1940, the Hungarian chemist [[George de Hevesy]] dissolved the gold medal, along with that of [[Max von Laue]] in [[aqua regia]] to prevent the Germans from taking them. He placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prize medals.{{sfn|de Hevesy|1962|pp=27–28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamma.nbi.dk/Galleri/gamma150/stephanschwarz.pdf |title=The Case of the Bottled Nobel medals |first=Stephan |last=Schwartz |publisher=[[Niels Bohr Institute]] |accessdate=20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Franck moved to the United States, where he had accepted a professorship at Johns Hopkins University.{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=63–64}} The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared to the one in Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. Franck was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the [[University of Chicago]], where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=223–224}}

Franck's first paper there, co-authored with [[Edward Teller]], was on photochemical processes in crystals.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=229}} [[Hans Gaffron]] became his collaborator.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|pp=233–235}} They were joined by Pringsheim, who escaped from Belgium after the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion]]. Franck arranged a position for Pringsheim at his laboratory.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=238}} Both his daughters and their families moved to the United States, and he was also able to bring out his elderly mother and aunt.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=233}} He became a [[naturalization|naturalised]] United States citizen on 21 July 1941,&lt;ref name="Papers"/&gt; so he was not an enemy alien when the United States [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|declared war on Germany]] on 11 December 1941. His daughters still were, though, so they were restricted from travelling, and could not take care of their mother when she fell ill and died on 10 January 1942, although they were permitted to attend her funeral.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=237}}

In February 1942, [[Arthur H. Compton]] established its [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the University of Chicago. As part of the [[Manhattan Project]], its mission was to build [[nuclear reactor]]s to create [[plutonium]] that would  be used in [[atomic bomb]]s.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=82–83}} The Metallurgical Laboratory's Chemistry Division was initially headed by [[Frank Spedding]], but he preferred hands on work to administration. Compton then turned to Franck, with some trepidation owing to his German background.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=123–124}}  Compton later wrote:

{{quote|How Franck welcomed an invitation to join our project! It was a vote of confidence that far exceeded his hopes, and it gave him a chance to do his part for the cause of freedom. "It's not the German people I'm fighting", he explained. "It's the Nazis. They have a stranglehold over Germany. The German people are helpless until we can break the strength of their Nazi masters." The chemists welcomed Franck as an elder scientific statesman whose guidance they were glad to follow.{{sfn|Compton|1956|p=124}} }}

In addition to heading the Chemistry Division, Franck was also the chairman of the Metallurgical Laboratory's Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which consisted of himself and [[Donald J. Hughes]], [[J. J. Nickson]], [[Eugene Rabinowitch]], [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], J. C. Stearns and [[Leó Szilárd]].&lt;ref name="Nina Byers" /&gt; In 1945, Franck warned [[Henry A. Wallace]] of their fears that "mankind has learned to unleash atomic power without being ethically and politically prepared to use it wisely."{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=16}} The committee compiled what became known as the [[Franck Report]]. Finished on 11 June 1945, it recommended that the [[atomic bomb]]s not be used on the Japanese cities without warning.&lt;ref name="Nina Byers"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=CERN Courier |date=13 October 2002 |url=https://arxiv.org/html/physics/0210058 |title=Physicists and the 1945 Decision to Drop the Bomb |first=Nina |last=Byers |authorlink=Nina Byers |accessdate=20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the [[Interim Committee]] decided otherwise.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=235–236}}

==Later life==
[[File:Portrait of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, James Franck and Rabi.jpg|thumb|right|Four Nobel Prize laureates. Franck between [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Albert Einstein]], with [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] in 1954]]
Franck married [[Hertha Sponer]] in a civil ceremony on 29 June 1946.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=259}} In his post-war research, he continued to tackle the problem of explaining the mechanism of photosynthesis. Meitner saw no break between his early and later work. She recalled that 

{{quote|Franck enjoyed talking about his problems, not so much to explain them to others as to satisfy his own mind. Once a problem had aroused his interest he was completely captivated, indeed obsessed by it. Common sense and straight logic were his main tools, together with simple apparatus. His research followed an almost straight line, from his early studies of ion mobilities to his last work on photosynthesis; it was always the energy exchange between atoms or molecules that fascinated him.{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|pp=17–18}} }}

In addition to the Nobel Prize. Franck was awarded the [[Max Planck medal|Max Planck Medal]] of the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]] in 1951 and the [[Rumford Medal]] of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his work on photosynthesis in 1955. He became an honorary citizen of Göttingen in 1953,{{sfn|Rice|Jortner|2010|p=20}} and was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1964|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1964]]. He died suddenly from a heart attack while visiting Göttingen on 21 May 1964,{{sfn|Kuhn|1965|pp=67–68}} and was buried in Chicago with his first wife.{{sfn|Lemmerich|2011|p=309}} In 1967, the University of Chicago named the [[James Franck Institute]] after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jfi.uchicago.edu/aboutinstitute/index.shtml |title=About the Institute |publisher=James Franck Institute |accessdate=20 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620070031/http://jfi.uchicago.edu/aboutinstitute/index.shtml |archivedate=20 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Franck (crater)|lunar crater]] has also been named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/2012?__fsk=-1273938748 |title=Planetary Names: Crater, craters: Franck on Moon |publisher=[[USGS]] and [[NASA]] |accessdate=20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His papers are in the University of Chicago Library.&lt;ref name="Papers"/&gt;

'''John Michael Safran''' ({{Hebrew name 1 | יְהוֹשֻׁעַ ספרן | Yehoshua Safran}}; born 13 August 1972)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Pat Mesiti, John Watson and Deborah Landis|episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/pat-mesiti-john-watson-and|access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|station=Triple J |date= 14 May 2016|season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an Australian radio personality, satirist, documentary maker and author, known for combining humour with religious, political and ethnic issues. First gaining fame appearing in ''[[Race Around the World]]'' in 1997, Safran went on to produce a series of documentaries, television shows and host radio programs.

Safran is known for his television stunts, which include placing a fatwa on Australian television host [[Rove McManus]], sneaking nine young men into an exclusive [[Melbourne]] [[nightclub]] by disguising them as members of American [[nu metal]] band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], running through [[Jerusalem]] wearing nothing but the beanie and scarf of [[St Kilda Football Club]], driving a remote controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], and his confrontation with tabloid current affairs host [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]].

Currently, he works as a journalist and released a book, ''[[Depends What You Mean By Extremist]]'', in May 2017.&lt;ref name="depends"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://penguin.com.au/books/depends-what-you-mean-by-extremist-9781926428772|title=Depends What You Mean by Extremist: Going Rogue with Australian Deplorables |publisher=Penguin Books Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Safran was born in [[Melbourne]] to Jewish parents.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=John Safran |episode-link= |url=http://www.abc.net.au/gnt/history/Transcripts/s1217450.htm|access-date= |series=George Negus Tonight |series-link= |first=George |last=Negus |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station= |date=11 October 2004 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandparents were [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] [[Bundism|Bundists]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au1"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=John Safran |episode-link= |url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1383760.htm |access-date= |series=Sunday Profile |series-link= |first=Monica |last=Attard |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station= |date=5 June  2005 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safran's mother, Gitl, was born in [[Uzbekistan]] as they were fleeing their home country for Australia.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Doreian |first=Robyn |date=29 September 2013 |title=What I know about women |url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/what-i-know-about-women-20130924-2ubvz.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney, New South Wales, Australia |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 2003.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/what-i-know-about-women-20130924-2ubvz.html|title=What I know about women|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal ancestors were [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jews]] and left shortly before the rise of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Katrina Lucas, Guy Rundle and Alex Safran|episode-link= |url=http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/triplej/safran/safran_2014_12_07.mp3 |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=7 December 2014 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one older sister, Margaret.

He grew up in [[Balwyn North]] and attended North Balwyn Primary School, [[Balwyn High School]] and [[Yeshivah College, Australia|Yeshivah College]] from Year 8 onwards.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt; He describes himself at Yeshivah, an all-boys Orthodox Jewish school, as being "the least religious kid in the most religious school in Australia".&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt; His best friends at Yeshivah were George Weinberg, Jeremy Weinstein, Raph Brous and Saskia Greta Sansom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Nick Cater, Andreas Dalsgaard and Charles Virtue |episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/nick-cater-andreas-dalsgaard |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=9 June 2013 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes=74:50 |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After school he studied journalism at [[RMIT University]]. He eventually dropped out without completing his degree and began work in advertising for [[Clemenger Harvie]]. During this time he also worked as a copywriter for [[Mazda]], [[Village Roadshow]] and [[Sea World (Australia)|Sea World]], where he wrote the company's jingle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Dr Clare Wright, David Wilcock, Anupam Sharma, Sharon Johal and Jason Callope |episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/dr-clare-wright-david-wilcock |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=10 June 2010 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motchkin building.jpg|thumb|Yeshivah College, Melbourne]]
During his final year in high school, Safran formed the hip-hop group [[Raspberry Cordial]] with his friend Chris Lumsden. They played to some success, receiving high rotation airplay on the city's community radio, playing many gigs in Melbourne and coming second in the [[RMIT University|RMIT]] [[Battle of the Bands]] competition. Their debut album was ''Melbourne Tram'', of which Safran apparently has hundreds of unsold cassettes in his bedroom to this day.

After winning a government youth music initiative, they followed up with ''Taste Test'', of which 500 copies were pressed. Of those only 93 sold, so the remaining 407 had to be crushed. He said that the world just "wasn't ready for white rappers then" and Raspberry Cordial "broke down the wall that [[Eminem]]'s been able to walk through."&lt;ref name="abc.net.au2"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=John Safran |episode-link= |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s892185.htm |access-date= |series=Enough Rope |series-link= |first=Andrew |last=Denton |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station= |date=30 June 2003 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Race Around the World''==
{{Main article|Race Around the World}}
Safran's first experience of national fame came via ''Race Around the World'', a television competition for young [[Television documentary|documentarian]]s run by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. In his audition tape, Safran was required to submit ten seconds of black, but instead he submitted ten seconds of [[Black Sabbath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Scarlet de Mason, Adam Shand and Varcha Sidwell |episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/pagan-scarlet-de-mason |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=22 January 2012 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safran started the race off timid and tame, being locked inside an [[Osaka Municipal Subway|Osaka subway station]] in his first entry. However, he quickly broke what he called the "fear barrier" to film his now famous segments. He ran [[streaking]] naked through the streets of [[Jerusalem]] wearing only the scarf and beanie of his favourite football club, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] to prove that God is Jewish (St Kilda's only Grand Final win fell on the same day as [[Yom Kippur]]).&lt;ref name="abc.net.au2"/&gt; He was baptised and placed a [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] curse on his ex-girlfriend in the [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au2"/&gt; He snuck into [[Disneyland]] via a work area and attached information plaques he made about founder [[Walt Disney]] to a display (highlighting little known Disney "facts" such as Walt Disney's alleged early support for [[Adolf Hitler]]) and got a Catholic priest to review [[death metal]] music.

Safran's segments scored well with both the judges and the public audience, Safran topped the viewer poll. He was, however, disqualified for a segment taped in a [[confessional]] booth (the program forbade [[hidden camera]] footage), the disqualification of the segment and subsequent loss of points meant that he finished last in the first season of ''Race Around the World''.

==After the race (1997-2002)==
After this brush with fame the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] commissioned two 30-minute TV pilots from Safran.

One pilot called ''John Safran: Media Tycoon'' focused on the media industry, airing in 1998. It became famous for a segment, involving then host of tabloid current affairs TV show ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'', where Safran harassed him in the style characteristic of ''A Current Affair'' by sorting through his bin, which was later satirised by comedian [[Shaun Micallef]]. [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]  had set-up members of the Paxton family. Safran and one of the victims, Shane Paxton, turned up to [[Ray Martin (television presenter)|Ray Martin]]'s home. Martin and his wife Dianne physically threatened Safran.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au2"/&gt; Martin's wife ripped apart Safran's Papier Mâché hat and Ray grabbed Safran by the collar, prompting Shane Paxton to intervene. Martin was in contact with the ABC and specifically warned Safran in the segment that he's spoken to Roger Grant the then Head of Corporate Affairs at the ABC.&lt;ref name="tvtonight.com.au"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Knox |first=David |date=26 April 2014 |title=John Safran still a sore point for Ray Martin |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/04/john-safran-still-a-sore-point-for-ray-martin.html |magazine=TV Tonight |location=Australia|publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin's connection with this executive at the ABC is suspected to be a reason the series never made it to air. The Ray Martin segment was later played on ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'', ''John Safran: The Lost Pilot'' and on Youtube.&lt;ref name="tvtonight.com.au"/&gt; In 2014, Martin still appeared bitter about the incident, calling Safran a "serial pest".&lt;ref name="tvtonight.com.au"/&gt;

The second pilot was titled ''John Safran: Master Chef''. This pilot focused on the food industry. Notably it featured a cooking segment where Safran prepared a beef dish. The twist comes when he arrives in an abattoir and shows detailed footage of cows being slaughtered to complete the dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craigmelville.com/safranabc/files/page25-1067-pop.html|title=Discontinued -- Prosite|author=Behance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though all unsuccessful, the pilots became hits via the Internet among university students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fuck-the-skull-of-jesus.mit.edu/safran.html|title=John Safran TV Pilots|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023085204/http://fuck-the-skull-of-jesus.mit.edu/safran.html|archivedate=23 October 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safran also recorded a parody of [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s song "[[Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)]]" entitled "Not the Sunscreen Song" which includes lines such as "Never live in [[Adelaide]], it's a hole" and "Remember, you can't get pregnant the first time you have sex". It peaked at No. 20 in 1998 and was nominated for an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]]. In [[Triple M]]'s ''2005 Greatest Songs Ever Written and Performed Since the Beginning of Time'' poll, "Not the Sunscreen Song" came in at #706 – one spot above "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]" by [[Stevie Wonder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHZWrET2CUA|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safran also presented segments for the [[Seven Network]]'s now defunct ''[[Late Report]]'', some were also screened in the United Kingdom with [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Disinformation (TV series)|Disinformation]]'' program. Safran attained police attention for a stunt to try and coerce [[cricket]]er [[Shane Warne]] into breaking a "no smoking" clause in an advertising contract with a nicotine gum manufacturer. Safran drove a remote controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the MCG pitch during a match. He was arrested for "[[pitch invasion]]", but the charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au2"/&gt;

==Documentaries==

===''Music Jamboree''===
{{Main article|John Safran's Music Jamboree}}
In 2002, Safran launched his documentary series ''John Safran's Music Jamboree''. On one occasion Safran and his crew stormed the courtyard of his former school and amid shocked religious students and teachers, he and his crew began to dance to the song "[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]". He was also able to gain entry into an exclusive Melbourne night club by dressing up nine men as the band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moskovitch |first=Greg |date=11 November 2014 |title=John Safran's 11 Greatest Music Moments |url=http://www.tonedeaf.com.au/425149/john-safrans-top-11-music-moments.htm |newspaper=Tone Deaf |location=Australia |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Screened on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] on Saturday nights, it opened Safran's work to youth 12 to 20 years old, who had not seen the original ''Race Around the World'' material. The show impressed the [[Australian Film Institute]] so much that it won two [[Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI awards]] in 2002; "Best Comedy Series" and "Most Innovative Program Concept".{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===''John Safran vs God''===
{{Main article|John Safran vs God}}
In August 2004 he debuted his new show ''John Safran vs God'', also on the SBS television network. The first seven episodes were typical Safran informative satire. The series' finale featured Safran being [[exorcism|exorcised]] of demons which had supposedly [[Demonic possession|possessed]] him during his dabblings with world religions. The exorcism was performed by well-known Christian fundamentalist [[Bob Larson]]. It has been claimed that Safran's behaviour during the exorcism was faked.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Safran has neither confirmed nor denied faking his behaviour, but in an interview with an Australian radio personality, Safran did say that he "felt something was going on", and that "there was something about the expression on my face". In an interview on [[Andrew Denton]]'s ''[[Enough Rope]]'' program, he claimed that he had no memory of the events during the exorcism, and stated that the footage shown on the show was merely the most interesting from hours of footage. ''John Safran vs God'' won a 2005 [[Australian Film Institute Awards|AFI Award]] for "Best Comedy Series".{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Before the exorcism, Safran went to [[Mozambique]] to have a curse, previously placed on the [[Australia national association football team|Australian national football team]] by a now-deceased witch doctor, lifted. He and former Australian football team captain [[Johnny Warren]] were covered in chicken's blood in the process. Subsequently, on 16 November 2005, [[Football World Cup 2006 - Oceania-South America Qualification Playoff|Australia qualified]] for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sygall |first=David |date=20 November 2005 |title=Socceroos owe it all to one man - and it isn't Hiddink |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/socceroos-owe-it-all-to-one-man--and-it-isnt-hiddink/2005/11/19/1132017026017.html%20Socceroos%20owe%20it%20all%20to%20one%20man%20%E2%80%93%20and%20it%20isn't%20Hiddink |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydeny, New South Wales, Australia |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Speaking in Tongues''===
{{Main article|Speaking in Tongues (TV show)}}
In 2005 and 2006, Safran co-hosted a television talk show entitled ''[[Speaking in Tongues (TV show)|Speaking in Tongues]]'' with [[Father Bob Maguire]], a Catholic priest who Safran met during the filming of ''John Safran vs God''. The 12-part series broadcast on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS Television]] and began on 7 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakingintongues.com.au/|title=Speaking in Tongues|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=|website=|publisher=Special Broadcasting Service|access-date=|quote=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220150104/http://speakingintongues.com.au/|archivedate=20 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Race Relations''===
{{Main article|John Safran's Race Relations}}
Safran spent portions of 2007 in Los Angeles shooting a pilot entitled ''John Safran Saves America'' for American MTV in which he tried to convince [[emo]]s to fight in Iraq, hit the couch with therapists who claim they can cure people of racism, and attempted to become gay to increase his standing in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/education/talkback_classroom/forums/2007_talkback_classroom_forums/john_safran/safran_bio/ |title=John Safran bio |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=nma.gov.au |publisher=National Museum of Australia |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safran stated in an interview that he hasn't heard back from the production company [[Reveille Productions]] whether the program has been purchased for production or not but as the months go on, "the answer isn't getting any yesser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last= |first= |subject-link= |interviewer= |title=John Safran |url=http://www.amateurscientist.org/mp3/TASP-11-7-07.mp3 |date=7 November 2007 |work=Amateur Scientist |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 ''John Safran's Race Relations'', an eight-part comedy documentary television series, was picked up by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Summer Heights High's Chris Lilley yet to sign new deal with ABC |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,24631775-5003422,00.html |newspaper=The Courier Mail |location=Queensland, Australia |date=10 November 2008 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this series, on 10 April 2009, John Safran took part in a [[Crucifixion#As a devotional practice|devotional crucifixion]], an [[Crucifixion in the Philippines|annual event]] occurring on [[Good Friday]] in the Philippines.

==Radio presenter and ''Sunday Night Safran''==
{{Main article|Sunday Night Safran}}
{{As of|2002}} Safran had been a regular host of Melbourne [[community radio]] station [[3RRR]] (Triple R) on its morning show "Breakfasters".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rrr.org.au/whats-going-on/news/triple-r-breakfasters-2013-line-up-announcement/&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he co-hosted the weekly radio show ''Sunday Night Safran'' on national youth radio station [[Triple J]] with [[Father Bob Maguire]]. After a lengthy hiatus late 2008 due to a busy filming schedule, ''Sunday Night Safran'' returned to the airwaves on 12 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SundayNightSafranArchive|title=Sunday Night Safran Archive|work=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program ended at the end of 2015.&lt;ref name="nickgalvin"&gt;{{cite news |last=Galvin |first=Nick |date=30 November 2015 |title=John Safran, Father Bob quit Triple J |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/john-safran-father-bob-quit-triple-j-20151130-glbaz7.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney, New South Wales, Australia |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was iconic because the co-hosts  talked to each other for much longer than instructed to (one such incident involved Fr Bob and Safran looking up the word ''[[monstrance]]'' in a dictionary following a dispute) and referring to the audience as "Dear Listeners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Razer |first=Helen |date=1 December 2015 |title= ''Sunday Night Safran'' was the best kind of journalism |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2015/12/01/sunday-night-safran-was-the-best-kind-of-journalism/ |newspaper=Crikey |location=Melbourne, Victoria, Australia |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By Safran's own admission, Maguire and he "only seem to talk about Scrabble and White Supremacists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Oliver Burkeman, Waleed Aly and Craig Reucassel |episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/oliver-burkeman-waleed-aly-and |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=17 March 2013 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the program's run, Safran and Maguire were able to get interviews from people such as religious scholar [[Reza Aslan]], [[Julian Assange|Julian Assange's]] mother Christine, ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' star [[Linda Blair]],  philosopher and [[The School of Life|School of Life]] founder [[Alain de Botton]], writer, retired prison doctor and psychiatrist [[Theodore Dalrymple]], West Memphis Three [[West Memphis Three#Damien Wayne Echols|Damien Echols]], antitheist [[Christopher Hitchens]], conspiracy theorist [[David Icke]], former white supremacist skinhead [[Frank Meeink]], pro-euthanasia doctor [[Philip Nitschke]], ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' director [[Joshua Oppenheimer]], journalist and writer [[Jon Ronson]], true crime writer and [[Ted Bundy]] co-worker [[Ann Rule]],  the Lizardman [[The Lizardman|Erik Sprague]], African-American pro-Israel political activist and Zionist [[Chloé Valdary]], Jewish activist against child sexual abuse [[Manny Waks]], psychic [[Lisa Williams (psychic)|Lisa Williams]] and John Safran's dad, Alex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/safran/podcast/ |title=Sunday Night Safran: Podcast |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=triplej.net.au |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Commission |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Fiction Writing and Journalism==
After discovering that a subject of his series ''Race Relations'', "Mississippi's most notorious white supremacist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readings.com.au/news/john-safran-on-murder-in-mississippi |title=John Safran on Murder in Mississippi |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 September 2013 |website=readings.com.au |publisher=Readings |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Barrett (lawyer)|Richard Barrett]] had been murdered, Safran returned to Mississippi to cover the trial. In 2013 [[Penguin Books]] published Safran's memoir of his experiences on this trip, ''Murder in Mississippi'' (published as ''God'll Cut You Down'' in the US).

Safran has also written a book about extremism in Australia, titled ''[[Depends What You Mean By Extremist]]''.  It was published in May 2017.&lt;ref name="depends"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Safran's favourite board game is [[Scrabble]]. However, he prefers to play one-on-one compared with four or more players, as one-on-one is a "game of skill" instead of a "game of luck".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Simon Taylor, Christine Assange, Chris Stedman and Khaled Khalafalla |episode-link= |url=https://soundcloud.com/triplejsundaynightsafran/comedian-simon-taylor |access-date= |series=Sunday Night Safran |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=Triple J |date=15 April 2012 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also owns all the comprehensive Scrabble dictionaries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Furthermore, Safran has a Scrabble Rug, a Scrabble board costume, Michael Groves Special Edition Scrabble, Hebrew Scrabble, CD Rom Scrabble, Key Ring Scrabble and a Scrabble watch.&lt;ref name="johnsafran"/&gt;

Safran has stated that he believes in a force or unifying spirit, and has some "supernatural beliefs".&lt;ref name="abc.net.au3"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=A Spiritual Special |episode-link= |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s3266962.htm |access-date= |series=Q and A |series-link= |first= |last= |network=Australian Broadcasting Commission |station=ABC1 |date=18 July 2011 |season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to explain that he doesn't think "these things have to be absolutely true to sort of be invigorating". Furthermore, he thinks mysticism is "a bit like trying to see how long you can hold your breath underwater or like driving without a seatbelt and it’s just like it’s fun. Like so basically religion is a bit like - trying to ban religion is like trying to ban snowboarding or something. It’s just like the rituals are just - can be really fun".&lt;ref name="abc.net.au3"/&gt; He thinks that organised religion "gets a pretty good break in Australia" as they don't have to pay as much tax and are allowed to preach against homosexuals.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au3"/&gt;

Safran thinks that religious education should be allowed in schools, and disagrees that it is brainwashing.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au3"/&gt;  
:::It’s like saying if you’re going to listen to heavy metal albums you’re going to go on shooting sprees. It’s not like having a chaplain in your school like it’s the only influence that’s going to be on the kid. [...] You’re just going to jump into strange people, so you bump into the chaplain and he’s teaching you all that strange stuff and then, I don’t know, you grow up and then you’ve got these cool stories about the mad chaplain at your school.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au3"/&gt;

Safran's first date was with a girl called Meg who he was doing work experience with at the ''Australian Jewish News'' in Year 10. They saw ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' together.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au1"/&gt; At university he began a relationship with a Bolivian girl, but it ended because Safran was "obsessed with [his] creative work" and at 19, Safran did not want the relationship to turn into something more serious.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au1"/&gt;

Safran dated playwright [[Lally Katz]].

During his audition for ''Race around the World'' in 1997, Safran had to provide a written submission. He was asked  "what are the most important things in your life?" Safran answered, 
:::Dearest judging panel, 
:::I guess I have to concede that the most important thing is love (the boy-meets-girl type). And even though I am 'in between drinks at the moment,' I will resist the temptation to become one of those cold-hearted cynical people who pretends love ain't such a big deal. 
:::Yours forever, John. XXOO 
:::PS — My CD collection comes a close second.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au2"/&gt;

'''Jon Winroth Broneer''' (born November 13, 1935 in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]; died July 15, 2006 in [[Tours]], [[France]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[wine]] [[journalist|critic]] who lived and worked in France.

== Biography ==
Second son of [[Oscar Broneer]], a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[immigrant]] to the [[United States]] who became a [[professor]] of [[archaeology]], Jon Winroth spent part of his childhood in Greece but was mainly educated in the U.S., where he met his future wife, Doreen. After finishing his college studies ''[[summa cum laude]]'' and winning a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright grant]], he and Doreen sailed for France aboard the ''[[SS Europa (1930)|Liberté]]''. There he discovered an approach to life that suited his own outlook, and he stayed, forging an international career in wine and building a family.

Broneer began by studying French, which lead to his Fulbright grant and a year of study in [[Poitiers]]. He worked on a Doctorat d'université at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] on [[Ali Pasha of Yannina]], and spent 1964 to 1966 in Greece studying fortresses built by Ali Pasha in [[Epirus]].

===Wine career===
Back in France, his interest in [[gastronomy]] and wine grew, from a passing interest which early friends in France had sparked to a serious search for what eluded him. Winroth published his first article on wine on January 31, 1967, in the international edition of ''[[The New York Times]]'', using his first and middle names — the middle (Winroth), a maternal family name, means "wine root" in old [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The article concerned the ''"Coupe du meilleur pot"'', a distinction awarded annually by the gastronomic journal ''[[La Table et la Route]]'' and by the ''[[Académie Rabelais]]'' to a Paris ''[[bistrot]]'' for its good, typical grower wines. Subsequently, he appeared regularly in this paper, which in 1967 became the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.

From the end of the 60s to the early 70s, Winroth also translated the articles of the ''[[La Revue du vin de France]]'' (RVF) for its English-language edition. As a member of the staff, he participated in the events it sponsored and its wine-tastings in the field, continuing his wine education through such notable tasters as [[Odette Kahn]] (editor of the RVF), [[Richard Olney]] and [[Robert Gauffard]], who were both esteemed contributors.

His first son, Eric, was born in 1968 and his second, George, in 1970.

In 1972 he founded the ''[[Academie du Vin|Académie du Vin]]'' with [[Steven Spurrier (wine)|Steven Spurrier]] and led many of the wine-tasting courses given there.&lt;ref name=decaaca&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Académie du Vin'' appeared in worldwide headlines in 1976, the bicentennial of the [[American Declaration of Independence]], for a [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|blind tasting of top American and French wines]].&lt;ref name=meijud&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Winroth enrolled in a tasting course for wine growers given by Professor [[Émile Peynaud]] at the [[University of Bordeaux]]. He stayed with M. Wainstein, a wine broker. After a full day of intense classes and wine-tastings, Wainstein would subject him to a blind tasting of about ten wines. Exhausted, Winroth felt he could not distinguish a [[Beaujolais]] from a [[Bordeaux wine]]. Finally, the last evening, the miracle occurred: he identified each wine correctly, and even picked out the "pirate", a foreign wine. He said that evening gave him almost as much pleasure as the certificate signed by Professor Peynaud.

===Illness===
Late in 1973 Winroth became severely ill and was hospitalized in intensive care for over three weeks. A familial disease had progressively reduced his [[kidney function]], and to survive he would have to undergo twice-weekly [[dialysis]]. Chronic [[hemodialysis]] was not available in centers at that time, and treatment would have to be done at home, attended by his wife, who already had assumed the psychological and financial aspects of the situation. He quickly learned the techniques and he and Doreen set about organizing their life and that of their sons to include home dialysis.&lt;ref name=decaorb/&gt; Admittedly, a wine critic who cannot [[urinate]] is at a certain disadvantage.

===Career in French Magazines===
In 1979, Jon Winroth began writing in [[French language|French]] as well as [[English language|English]]. He was invited to speak on his technique of long dialysis and long intervals between dialyses (the contrary is the rule) at a meeting of the [[National Kidney Foundation]] by Professor [[Robert Swenson, MD, PhD|Robert Swenson]] of [[Stanford University]]. [[Gambro]] kindly paid for his trip, Prof. Swenson put him up and another [[nephrologist]] offered free dialysis. Between the sessions of the meeting and the obligatory dialysis sessions, he found time to see 17 top [[California wine-makers]]. Returning with 13 bottles in his luggage, he sneaked out the [[customs|"Nothing to declare" exit]] unquestioned. These 13 bottles were tasted at a memorable meal at the [[Trou Gascon]], [[:fr:Alain Dutournier|Alain Dutournier]]'s early restaurant, and Jon Winroth's following article in ''[[Lui]]'' contributed to the increasing interest in [[California wine]]s among French wine lovers.

This appearance in ''Lui'', and the monthly column that the editor, Jean-Pierre Binchet, subsequently created for him, initially raised the hackles of his French colleagues. After some months, however, Jon Winroth became a fully accepted part of the French-language wine scene. Soon he was asked to contribute to ''[[:fr:Cuisine et vins de France|Cuisine et vins de France]]'' and the ''Revue du Vin de France''. Eventually, his "wine of the month" column in Lui was moved to ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', where it appeared weekly. While he was appearing in both ''Elle'' and ''Lui'', his French colleagues offered all the expected [[Off-color humor|sexually-oriented jokes]].

In addition to his regular articles in ''International Herald Tribune'', the ''Revue du vin de France'' and ''Cuisine et Vins de France'', he continued to contribute to ''La Table et la route'' and ''Elle International''. Also in 1979, Jon Winroth wrote of another memorable tasting, that of a 1799 [[Château Lafite-Rothschild|Lafite-Rothschild]] in [[Paris]]. Another high point was a controversial article on the ''[[rosé]]s'' of [[Provence]] that appeared in ''Lui'' in 1979, in which he outspokenly criticized the mediocrity and ''laisser-aller'' of this wine region which had an immense unused potential for producing good wine.&lt;ref name=luiros&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Threatened lawsuits were finally laid to rest, but the Winroths noticed that the following year advertisements for Provence wines were emphasizing the reds and whites, not the rosés. The frankness of Jon Winroth's articles progressively gained him a solid reputation of intransigence in wine circles. Steven Spurrier described his style in ''[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]]'' as "vociferously vocal".

In 1981 the ''International Herald Tribune'' published his book, ''Wine As You Like It'', which aimed to open the world of wine to the amateur.

After meeting Jacques Dupont and Pierre Crisol, who were then the wine editors for [[Gault Millau]], and finding their approach to tasting very close to his own, he created with them ''La Cote des Vins'', a bi-weekly newsletter for wine professionals. This publication reported their tasting results and comments, sometimes the result of tastings of 200 wines in one day.

===Moving and Retirement===
With the children grown and gone and the attractions of Paris outweighed by its increasing noise and pollution, Jon Winroth and Doreen followed the [[TGV]] line toward Tours and found a small house in front of a large cave in a [[calcareous]] hillside near [[Montoire-sur-le-Loir]] in the ''coteaux du Vendômois''. Jon Winroth closely followed the progress of these local wines and shared the joy of his winemaker friends when they finally attained ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' status in 2000. He continued writing, with samples arriving by mail and truck and articles dispatched by [[fax]], until his retirement in 2000.

He was made a ''[[Mérite Agricole|Chevalier de l'Ordre du Mérite Agricole]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref name=decaorb/&gt;

Jon Winroth died in the Clinique Saint-Gatien in [[Tours]] on July 15, 2006, at the age of 70 years, of complications of his renal disease, after 32½ years of home dialysis.

Dr. '''Linda Long''' is a [[Biochemistry|biochemist]] and musician, who has combined these two fields to create what she terms '''molecular music'''.

Dr. Long worked as a biochemist and a Research Fellow in [[Complementary Medicine]] at [[Exeter University]], specialising in the fields of homeopathy, herbal medicine and music therapy. Her work has been published in various medical journals, and she is an associate editor of the Journal ''[[Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies]]'', published by the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/pr050531a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924221346/http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/pr050531a.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been working on molecular music since the 1990s.

She has been awarded an Invention and Innovation award over two years by [[NESTA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/about/directory/index.aspx?a=L|title=About us|work=nesta.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has enabled her to develop her promotion of music in education, as well as to release two CDs of her music: ''Music of the Plants'' and ''Music of the Body''. The award has also helped her develop an exhibit at [[At-Bristol|Explore @Bristol]].

==Molecular music==
Molecular music involves the translation of the 3-dimensional positions of a protein's amino acids into note sequences. This is not an arbitrary process; x-ray crystallography data is used to relate specific musical effects such as volume and pitch to the protein's molecular structure. In this way, characteristic patterns in protein structure are heard as recognisable musical note patterns from the structural data.

This method of translating protein structures into music is said by Dr. Long to be a useful aid in understanding proteins for the visually impaired.

==Discography==
''Music of the Plants'' (1999) is a CD of five tracks. Conventional track titling is eschewed in favour of a description of the specific protein used for each track:

# [[Pokeweed]] ''[[Phytolacca americana]]'' pokeweed antiviral protein 
# [[White mustard]] ''[[Sinapsis alba]]'' [[myrosinase]]
# [[Parsley]] ''[[Petroselinum crispum]]'' [[plastocyanin]] (electron transport protein)
# [[Clover]] ''[[Trifolium repens]]'' [[cyanogenic β-glucosidase]]
# [[Jimson weed]] ''[[Datura stramonium]]'' [[tropinone reductase]]

''Music of the Body'' (2002) is a longer CD, and the tracks have titles related to their relevant protein's function. as the title implies, all the proteins are found in the human body.

# Absorb and Balance - [[thyrotropin]]
# Voice of Metabolism - [[thyroid]] hormone
# Calcium Chimes - [[parathyroid]] hormone
# Mineral Replenish - [[guanylin]]
# Growth Control - [[somatostatin]]
# Music for Muscle and Bone - [[growth hormone]]
# Inner Cycles - [[progesterone]] receptor protein
# Nurture - chorionic [[gonadotrophin]]
# Fertility - [[Follitropin]]

A former law student, '''Majed Mashaan Ghanem Moqed''' ({{lang-ar|ماجد مشعان موقد}}, {{transl|ar|''Mājad Mashaʼān Mūqad''}}; also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Moqued''') (June 18, 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John J. Lumpkin |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/majed_moqed.htm |title=Majed Moqed |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; – September 11, 2001) was one of five [[Organizers of the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[American Airlines Flight 77]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].

A [[Saudi]], Moqed was studying law at a university in [[Saudi Arabia]] before joining [[Al-Qaeda]] in 1999 and being chosen to participate in the 9/11 attacks. He arrived in the United States in May 2001 and helped with the planning of how the attacks would be carried out.

On September 11, 2001, Moqed boarded American Airlines Flight 77 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane so that it could be crashed into [[the Pentagon]].

==Biography==
Moqed was a law student from the small town of Al-Nakhil, [[Saudi Arabia]] (west of [[Medina]]), studying at [[King Fahd University]]'s Faculty of Administration and Economics. Before he dropped out, he was apparently recruited into [[al-Qaeda]] in 1999 along with friend [[Satam al-Suqami]], with whom he had earlier shared a college room. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The two trained at [[Khalden training camp|Khalden]], a large training facility near [[Kabul]] that was run by [[Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi]].  A friend in [[Saudi Arabia]] claimed he was last seen there in 2000, before leaving to study English in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2001/arabnews092201.html Arab News, 9/22/01]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000, Moqed and Suqami flew into [[Iran]] from [[Bahrain]] together.

Some time late in 2000, Moqed traveled to the [[United Arab Emirates]], where he purchased [[traveler's cheques]] presumed to have been paid for by 9/11 financier [[Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Wail al-Shehri]], [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Ahmed al-Nami]].

Known as ''al-Ahlaf'' during the preparations,&lt;ref name="willalOmari"&gt;Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others&lt;/ref&gt; Moqed then moved in with hijackers [[Salem al-Hazmi]], [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]] and [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] in an apartment in [[Paterson, New Jersey]].

===2001===
According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], Moqed first arrived in the United States on May 2, 2001.

In March 2001, Moqed, [[Hani Hanjour]], Hazmi and [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]] rented a minivan and travelled to [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].  There they met a contact in the parking lot of a local convenience store who provided them with [[Identity document forgery|false ID]]s. (This was possibly Eyad Alrababah, a Jordanian charged with document fraud).

Moqed was one of the five hijackers who asked for a state identity card on August 2, 2001.  On August 24, both Mihdhar and Moqed tried to purchase flight tickets from the [[American Airlines]] online ticket-merchant, but had technical difficulties resolving their address and gave up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html |title=Statement of FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III to 9/11 Joint Intelligence Committee |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees at Advance Travel Service in [[Totowa, New Jersey]] later claimed that Moqed and Hanjour had both purchased tickets there.  They claimed that Hani Hanjour spoke very little English, and Moqed did most of the speaking.  Hanjour requested a seat in the front row of the airplane.  Their credit card failed to authorize, and after being told the agency did not accept personal [[cheque]]s, the pair left to withdraw cash.  They returned shortly afterwards and paid $1842.25 total in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm | work=The Boston Globe | title=Boston.com / Fighting Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
During this time, Moqed was staying in Room 343 of the ''Valencia Motel''. On September 2, Moqed paid cash for a $30 weekly membership at [[Gold's Gym]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]].

Three days later  he was seen on an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] camera with [[Hani Hanjour]].  After the attacks, employees at an [[pornography|adult video store]], ''Adult Lingerie Center'', in [[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]] claimed that Moqed had been in the store three times, although there were no transactions slips that confirmed this.&lt;ref&gt;Newsday,  9/23/01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks==
{{Main|American Airlines Flight 77}}

On September 11, 2001, Moqed arrived at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].

According to the [[9/11 Commission]] Report, Moqed set off the metal detector at the airport and was screened with a hand-wand. He passed the cursory inspection, and was able board his flight at 7:50. He was seated in 12A, adjacent to Mihdhar who was in 12B.  Moqed helped to hijack the plane and assisted [[Hani Hanjour]] in crashing the plane into [[the Pentagon]] at 9:37 A.M., killing 189 people (64 on the plane and 125 on the ground).

The flight was scheduled to depart at 08:10, but ended up departing 10&amp;nbsp;minutes late from Gate&amp;nbsp;D26 at Dulles.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/legislative/research/9-11/staff-report-sept2005.pdf |title=Staff Monograph on the "Four Flights and Civil Aviation Security" |date=September 2005 |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5T7H27edX?url=http://www.archives.gov/legislative/research/9-11/staff-report-sept2005.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to [[air traffic control]] occurred at 08:50:51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregor |first=Joseph A. |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/ATC_%20Report_AA77.pdf |format=PDF|title=ATC Report American Airlines Flight 77 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 08:54, Flight&amp;nbsp;77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south, and then hijackers set the flight's [[autopilot]] heading for Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/autopilot_AA77_UA93_study.pdf |format=PDF|title=Study of Autopilot, Navigation Equipment, and Fuel Consumption Activity Based on United Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;93 and American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 Digital Flight Data Recorder Information |last=O’Callaghan |first=John |author2=Bower, Daniel |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2002-02-13 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger [[Barbara Olson]] called her husband, [[United States Solicitor General]] [[Theodore Olson]], and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Glen |url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm |title=Probe reconstructs horror, calculated attacks on planes |work=The Boston Globe |date=2001-11-23 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 09:37, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of [[the Pentagon]], killing all 64 aboard (including the hijackers), along with 125 on the ground in the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/AAL77_fdr.pdf |format=PDF|title=American Airlines Flight 77 FDR Report |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight&amp;nbsp;77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any [[DNA]] samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/08/17/attack/main519033.shtml |title=Remains Of 9 Sept. 11 Hijackers Held |date=2002-08-17 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cstl.nist.gov/div831/strbase/pub_pres/Edson2004.pdf |format=PDF|title=Naming the Dead - Confronting the Realities of Rapid Identification of Degraded Skeletal Remains |author=Edson, S.M.|journal=Forensic Science Review |volume=16 |date=January 2004 |accessdate=2008-09-30 | issue=1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attacks his family told [[Arab News]] that Moqed had been a fan of sports, and enjoyed travelling. Additionally, the U.S. announced it had found a "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Student Identity Card" bearing Moqed's name in the rubble surrounding the Pentagon. They also stated that it appeared to have been a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Ch2.pdf |title=9/11 Commission Report |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

    The following categories contain articles about individuals who almost all have Arabic names.
    Arabic names don't have European style surnames that are inherited, father to son.

==Early life==
Anna Mantsopa Makhetha was born in 1795. She was born Koena-li-Fule which translates to '''The crocodiles are feeding'''. Mantsopa was the daughter of Nkopane and Sesilone. As a child, she was taken captive for 6 months by an [[Nguni people|Nguni]] tribe called Amankowane. She managed to escape when some of her relatives came into the area for trading purposes. She lost her father to cannibalism during a time of famine for amaZulu and [[Basotho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/7953/Colman%20MA%20Modderpoort%20combined.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Religious traditions, heritage and land: dynamics in making a heritage site with contested claims to land a tourist attraction. A case study of Modderpoort|last=Colman|first=Michelle|date=2010|website=Wits Institutional Repository Environment on DSpace|publisher=Wits University|access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She was to marry her cousin – Lekote – who was the son of Makhetha, but he died after paying Mahadi (also known as [[lobola]]). She then married Lekote’s older brother – Selatile – and became his sixth wife. They lived at Lekhalong-la-Bataung. She bore three daughters and one son: Ntsopa, Motsielehi, Ts’iu and Sesilane. It is customary in the Basotho culture for a mother to change her name after the birth of her first child by adding the prefix “Ma” to the name of the first child. This is how Koena-li-Fule became Mantsopa. It is however also believed that her name could have been derived from her pottery skills as Letsopa is clay. She also had great storytelling abilities, described as being remarkable in her power to hold people spellbound as she related what had appeared to her in dreams; she acquired an audience and was a great singer as well. The name of her first child was therefore derived from her talents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/7953/Colman%20MA%20Modderpoort%20combined.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Religious traditions, heritage and land: dynamics in making a heritage site with contested claims to land a tourist attraction. A case study of Modderpoort|last=Colman|first=Michelle|date=2010|website=Wits Institutional Repository Environment on DSpace|publisher=Wits University|access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophecies==
In 1853, Mantsopa foretold the triumph over their old enemies – the [[Batlokwa]] under the leadership of '''Sekonyela'''; and in 1855, she predicted an extended period of peace and harmony for the [[Basotho]]. Before the '''Seqiti Wars''' of 1865, Mantsopa prophesied victory but this was not realised; and she alluded it to the failure of the troops to follow her guidance.{{sfn|Cuthbetson|2003|pp=216-217}}
  
Mantsopa is also famous for foretelling the rinderpest epidemic after World War I, warning Africans against involvement. The sinking of the [[SS Mendi]] is also attributed to this warning. Her prophecies also included the coming of a motor car where she said that people will be travelling sitting down as well as the aeroplane where she said that birds would fly between the earth and the sky.{{sfn|Cuthbetson|2003|pp=216-217}}

==Conversion==
Her role as an advisor to Moshoeshoe ended in 1868 when the British annexed Basotholand. That same year, she was baptised by a French missionary called '''Theophile Jousse''' and given the name Anna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/7953/Colman%20MA%20Modderpoort%20combined.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Religious traditions, heritage and land: dynamics in making a heritage site with contested claims to land a tourist attraction. A case study of Modderpoort|last=Colman|first=Michelle|date=2010|website=Wits Institutional Repository Environment on DSpace|publisher=Wits University|access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her move to Modderpoort happened when she joined Anglican missionaries not long after her baptism. Although she had been baptised as a Christian, Mantsopa continued to work with the spiritual world. She was stopped by missionaries from practicing this work as they deemed it black magic. This did not stop her from continuing to use herbs and have people come from far and wide to consult with her.{{sfn|Cuthbetson|2003|p=219}}

==Death==

[[File:Mantsopa_Grave.jpeg|thumb|right|Grave of Prophetess Mantsopa [[Modderpoort]].]]
Mantsopa died at the age of 111. Her death was registered as 11 November 1906 in the burial records of the Bloemfontein Diocese of the Anglican Church which names Father Norton as having performed the funeral ceremony. She was buried with Christian rites in the Modderpoort cemetery, alongside the Brothers of the Society of St Augustine and the white residents of [[Modderpoort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saintaugustines.co.za/wp/mantsopa-spring-water|title=Mantsopa Spring Water|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=2014|website=St Augustines|publisher=Genix Group|access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Mantsopa Cave.jpeg|thumb|right|Cave of Prophetess Mantsopa [[Modderpoort]].]]
At Modderpoort there are two sides strongly associated with Mantsopa’s legacy and are usually included in pilgrimage visits for either ritual performances or prayers. One is a freshwater spring, reputedly pointed out to Mantsopa as a source of ‘sacred’ water by her ancestors. The second one is the cave where Mantsopa prayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coplan|first=DB|title=Land from the ancestors: Popular religious pilgrimage along the South Africa-Lesotho border|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|volume=29 |issue=4|date=2003|page=988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The grave and cave have been declared as provincial heritage sites in the Free State by the Free State Provincial Heritage Resources Authority.&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Provincial Government Notice 03, Free State Province Government Gazette, Vol 03, No 05, Bloemfontein: Government Printer, 8 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
To this day Pilgrims from all over Southern Africa, travel many miles to Modderpoort Mission to pay respects to the memory of their prophetess and to collect water from the sacred spring. The cave has become a pilgrimage chapel as homage to the local prophetess, Anna Mantsopa Makhetha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/bldgframes.php?bldgid=7601|title=Cave Chapel: Modderpoort|last=Earl|first=Darryl|date=2015|website=Artefacts|publisher=Philippe Menache and Darryl Earl David|access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Jenkins Crawford''' (March 17, 1820 – July 23, 1883) was an [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and a representative to the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]] during the [[American Civil War]] from the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Life and career==
Martin J. Crawford was born March 17, 1820 in [[Jasper County, Georgia]]. He attended Brownwood Institute and [[Mercer University]] in [[Macon, Georgia]]. After studying law, he was admitted to the [[State Bar of Georgia]] in 1839.&lt;ref name="congbiomjc"&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000892 CRAWFORD, Martin Jenkins, (1820 - 1883)].  congress.gov. Retrieved July 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford started his [[law practice|practice]] in [[Hamilton, Georgia]]—where Crawford was also involved with farming.

[[File:Hon. Crawford - NARA - 528697.jpg|thumb|left|Rep. Martin Jenkins Crawford]]
From 1845–47, Crawford served in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]]. After moving to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1849, he served as a delegate to the Southern convention at Nashville in May 1850. From February 1, 1854, to November 1854, Crawford was a judge of the [[superior court]]s of the Chattahoochee circuit.

In 1854, Crawford was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[34th United States Congress]] to represent [[Georgia's 2nd congressional district]]. He was reelected to two additional terms in the seat ([[35th United States Congress|35th]] and [[36th United States Congress|36th]] Congresses), and his congressional service spanned from March 4, 1855, until his resignation on January 23, 1861, with Georgia having seceded the [[US|Union]] on January 22.

After resigning the U.S. Congress, Crawford was elected to the [[Confederate Provisional Congress]], serving from January 1861 to February 22, 1862. [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] appointed Crawford as a special commissioner to the United States in [[Washington, D.C.]]

Martin J. Crawford organized the {{anchor|3rd Regiment, Georgia Cavalry}}3rd Regiment, Georgia Cavalry in May 1862 to support the [[Confederate States Army]], operating with the [[Army of Tennessee]]. Under Crawford's command the 3rd Regiment saw combat, fighting in [[Kentucky]] with General Wheeler. The next campaign at [[New Haven]] saw most of the regiment taken prisoner—the retreating contingent fought at the [[Battle of Murfreesboro]]—then reconstituted under Colonel [[J.J. Morrison]]. The Georgia 3rd surrendered on April 26, 1865 with the [[Army of Tennessee]]—surrendering field officers were Colonels Martin J. Crawford, Richard E. Kennon, and Robert Thompson; Lieutenant Colonel James T. Thornton; and Majors Daniel F. Booton and Hiram H. Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-regiments-detail.htm?regiment_id=CGA0003RC01 3rd Regiment, Georgia Cavalry]. nps.gov. Retrieved July 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Crawford became judge of the superior court of the Chattahoochee circuit on October 1, 1875 to fill a vacancy. He was reappointed in 1877 and served on that bench until he resigned on February 9, 1880. The next day, he was appointed to a vacant position on the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] and served on that court until his death in Columbus. He was buried in that city's Linwood Cemetery.

Smith attracted attention in 2003 when she sang a cover version of "[[Jolene (song)|Jolene]]" by [[Dolly Parton]] for the tribute album

'''Nariman A. Irani''' (? -  December 10, 1977) was an [[Bollywood]] [[cinematographer]] and [[film producer]]. He is most known for producing ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978) made under his banner Nariman Films and for his work as cinematographer in [[Chhailla Babu]](1977). He died in an accident, even before ''Don'' was even completed, eventually the film was a big hit and led to the [[Don (film series)|Don film franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/oct/27zeenat.htm Zeenat: I think Vijay is missing] [[Rediff.com]], Movies,  October 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite news |title=Don 2 runs into legal maze by Nariman Films|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-11-12/news/30391224_1_nariman-films-legal-notice-big-films|publisher=The Economic Times |date= Nov 12, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a cinematographer he is known for his films like ''Talash'', ''Saraswatichandra'' and ''[[Phool Aur Patthar]]'',  ''[[Roti Kapada Aur Makaan]]''&lt;ref name=eco/&gt; and [[Chhailla Babu]]. He won the [[16th National Film Awards]] for [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Black-and-white|B &amp; W]]) for ''[[Saraswatichandra (film)|Saraswatichandra]]'' (1968).,&lt;ref name="16thaward"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iffi.nic.in/Dff2011/Frm16thNFAAward.aspx|title=16th National Film Awards|publisher=[[International Film Festival of India]]|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="16thawardPDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dff.nic.in/2011/16th_nff_1970.pdf|title=16th National Film Awards (PDF)|publisher=[[Directorate of Film Festivals]]|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he also won the [[Filmfare Award for Best Cinematographer]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deep750.googlepages.com/FilmfareAwards.pdf List of Filmfare Award Winners and Nominations, 1953–2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinematographer Nariman Irani, while working Chhailla Babu decided to borrow most of the plot of Chhailla Babu and shared a modified story idea to Chandra Barot,who made the new modified story as the film Don (1978). While ''Don'' was still under production, he was badly hurt, when after a sudden [[cloudburst]] in November 1977, a wall fell on him while he was preparing to take a shot for another film at [[Rajkamal Kalamandir]] studios, Mumbai during the making of Manojj Kumar's Kranti. A wall collapsed on him and he suffered a hip bone injury. Though he was hospitalised, but died a few days later.&lt;ref name=eco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2006/oct/16sld3.htm rediff.com: An exclusive interview with Chandra Barot, who made the first Don&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Rediff.com, October 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
His home banner Nariman Films was revived 18 years later by his sons, Nadir and Nadeem, with [[Suniel Shetty]]-starrer ''Shashtra'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Don producers make a comeback|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-11/news-interviews/29532121_1_producers-sanjay-dutt-comeback |publisher=The Times of India |date= May 11, 2011 |accessdate=Feb 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moyoro Shell Midden.jpg|thumb|The Moyoro Shell Midden at [[Abashiri, Hokkaidō]], the ruins of the Okhotsk culture]]
The '''Okhotsk culture''' is an archaeological coastal fishing and [[hunter-gatherer]] culture of the lands surrounding the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] (600–1000 in [[Hokkaido]], until 1500 or 1600 in the [[Kuril Islands]]): the [[Amur River]] basin, [[Sakhalin]], northern [[Hokkaido]], the Kuril Islands, and [[Kamchatka]]. It appears to have spread outwards from the Amur River region, only to be partially absorbed or pushed back by the [[Satsumon culture]] spreading north from [[Japan]], but nevertheless surviving, for example, in the [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]] of Sakhalin and the Amur and in [[Itelmen]] of Kamchatka. The historical [[Ainu people]] appear to have retained a strong element of the Okhotsk, but the Satsumon culture, and perhaps language, appears to have dominated the mix of people who contemporaneously became known as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 =Sato|first1 =Takehiro|last2= Amano|first2= Tetsuya|title=Origins and genetic features of the Okhotsk people, revealed by ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis|journal =[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer (journal)]]|doi =10.1007/s10038-007-0164-z|pmid=17568987|volume=52|year=2007|pages=618–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental Okhotsk elements remained, however, such as the [[bear cult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trekhsviatskyi | first1 = Anatolii  | year = 2007 | title = At the far edge of the Chinese Oikoumene: mutual relations of the indigenous population of Sakhalin with the Yuan and Ming dynasties | jstor = 41933457 | journal = Journal of Asian History | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 134–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peepers''' is a [[fictional]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Captain America]] Annual'' #4 and was created by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Peter Quinn was born in [[Cedar City, Utah]]. He was recruited by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] as a mercenary and professional criminal to be part of his new [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. He took the name ''Peeper'' and joined [[Slither (comics)|Slither]], [[Randall Darby|Shocker]], [[Lifter (comics)|Lifter]] and [[Burner (comics)|Burner]]. After failing their first mission and being defeated by [[Captain America]], Magneto abandoned them.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America Annual'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

The group changed their name to ''[[Resistants|Mutant Force]]'' and offered their services to the [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]] and battled [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] for him in his scheme to take over the U.S. Peeper became the field leader of the team, his powers allowing him to see his enemy's movements and plan for them. They battled [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]]. Despite being successful at first in defeating the Defenders and capturing the female Defenders so that the Mandrill could enslave them, the group was defeated by the Defenders during their third encounter.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #78-80&lt;/ref&gt; Mutant Force was arrested, but they bargained with the U.S. government and became their agents in exchange for their [[presidential pardon]]. Their tenure as government agents was short. They battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and later testified before a secret tribunal against the Defenders.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #87&lt;/ref&gt; Peeper and Mutant Force were later employed by [[Professor Power]]'s [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]. Alongside Mutant Force and [[Mad Dog (comics)|Mad Dog]], he battled the Defenders once again.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #129-130&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Red Skull]] became the group's new sponsor. Now calling themselves the [[Resistants]], they posed as a group advocating mutant rights, but actually operated as a terrorist group. Slither left the group at this time. To avoid being associated with their old criminal group, many of the members changed their identities. It was later revealed that the Resistants were one of many groups that was unknowingly controlled by the newly resurrected villain, the [[Red Skull]].  Peeper now called himself ''Occult'' and wore a helmet to hide his features. The group rescued the mutant [[Quill (comics)|Quill]] from the custody of the new Captain America, [[U.S. Agent (comics)|John Walker]], and [[Battlestar (comics)|Battle Star]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #343&lt;/ref&gt; The group fought Captain America again and claimed that their actions were all to oppose the Mutant Registration Act. They were soon joined by various new members, including [[Mentallo]] who posed as ''Think Tank''. This time they came into conflict with [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], a group who ironically enough, had been another incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, but had now become government agents.

The new Captain America, John Walker, lost control during a battle near Carson City, Nevada, and seemingly killed Occult along with several other members of the Resistants due to his recent violent streak as the result of the death of his parents at the hand of the [[Watchdogs (Marvel Comics)|Watchdogs]], another group the Red Skull had formed to discredit the image of Captain America. During the fight, Quinn was seriously injured after hitting high tension power lines and was electrocuted and believed dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #346&lt;/ref&gt;

These injuries may have been the cause of his later mental problems: in his next appearance Quinn would never speak.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #426&lt;/ref&gt; Another mission as the Resistants was a failure as well, so the team changed its name back to Mutant Force, but by now Peeper was becoming afraid during combat. Mutant Force was defeated and Quinn, now calling himself Peepers, was imprisoned at ''The Cage''.&lt;ref&gt;''New Warriors'' vol.2 #6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] met him and befriended Peepers, who by now was a stuttering, nervous mutant who had become mentally unbalanced. Peepers repeatedly stabbed a prisoner who tried to kill Beast at this time.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol.2 #164-165&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he was released and became a bartender at Satan's Circus, a bar for supervillains.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X'' vol.2 #26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post M-Day===
During the battle with the [[House of M]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] changed reality, genetically altering over ninety percent of the world's mutant population and only leaving a few hundred with their powers as a result. During the aftermath of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] Peepers is seen with [[Mammomax]] and [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] on the run from the Sapien League. He comments that the X-Men hate them but Mammomax replies that the X-Men are heroes and won't turn them away, all three are caught and almost burned alive at the Xavier Institute's doorstep if not for the timely arrival of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Decimation: House of M - the Day After'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; However he becomes lost in the confusion of the Sapien League's attack and the arrival of the Sentinels, but he meets up with [[Outlaw (comics)|Outlaw]] who is also on her way to the Xavier institute for the promised sanctuary. The two become caught up in the fight between the Sapien League, the O*N*E* soldiers, and the X-Men all before reaching the mansion.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' vol.2 #179&lt;/ref&gt; Peepers stays quiet and out of the way of most of the other members of the 198. He is one of the mutants that receives a "tracking" chip and then later has it removed by [[Mister M (comics)|Mr. M]] and follows him when he leads his exodus from the institute.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: The 198'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]===
During [[X-Men: Messiah Complex]] Peepers is seen driving down a road while on the phone with [[X-Factor Investigations]], claiming that he believes he is being followed.  After hitting a deer, Peepers loses control of his car and finds himself lodged deep in the brush by the side of the road.  While emerging from the wreckage, he is attacked, killed, and eaten by [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]]. [[Siryn]] received the call and rushed to investigate, but arrives only to find what remains of his body.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Factor'' vol.3 #26&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Peepers is shown alive and well in [[Murderworld (comics)|Murderworld]] from which he presumably escapes from with his fellow captives after [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] is defeated by [[Gwenpool]] and [[Deadpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Hastings|penciller = Alti Firmansyan and Gurihiru|inker = Alti Firmansyan and Gurihiru|colorist = Rachelle Rosenberg and Gurihiru|letterer = VC's Clayton Cowles|editor = Heather Antos|title = The Unbelievable Gwenpool|volume = 1|issue = #13|date = 8 March 2017|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Peepers was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with "telescopic eyesight" superior to that of any normal human; his telescopic vision enables him to clearly see objects which are miles beyond normal vision range or too small for ordinary vision, and he can even see through matter. He can also project beams of energy from his eyes.

==Other versions==

===[[House of M]]===
Peepers was seen as a member of Magneto's mutant army during his rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: House of M'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Peepers was later seen assisting Zebediah Killgrave in showing Ronan around the Earth Army's complex.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' Vol 2 #11&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutton committed suicide by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] in March 2009, aged 62, rather than report to [[federal prison]] after being convicted of offenses related to moonshining and [[Criminal possession of a weapon|illegal firearm possession]]. Since his death, a new company and associated whiskey brand have been named after him.

==Moonshining career and rise to fame==
Sutton had a long career making moonshine and [[Rum-running|bootlegging]]. Sutton said he considered moonshine production a legitimate part of his heritage, as he was a [[Scots-Irish American]] and descended from a long line of moonshiners.&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; In the 1960s or 1970s, Sutton was given the nickname of "Popcorn" after his frustrated attack on a bar's faulty popcorn vending machine with a [[pool cue]].&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=APObit/&gt; Before his rise to fame at around 60 years of age, he had been in trouble with the law several times, but had avoided prison sentences. He was convicted in 1974 of selling untaxed liquor&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Famed18/&gt; and in 1981 and 1985 on charges of [[possession of a controlled substance|possessing controlled substances]] and [[assault with a deadly weapon]], but he received only [[probation]] sentences in those cases.&lt;ref name=Famed18/&gt;&lt;ref name=Golden&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/bulletin/archive/2009/07/07-01/golden-moment.php|title=Golden Moment: Bulletin: NC State University|author=Ford, D'Lyn|date=July 1, 2009|accessdate=May 16, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027120106/http://www.ncsu.edu/bulletin/archive/2009/07/07-01/golden-moment.php|archivedate=October 27, 2014|df=}} (also available as [http://ncsu.edu/project/nsaudiovideo/pdf/bulletin-2009-0701.pdf pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutton then wrote a self-published autobiography and guide to moonshine production called ''Me and My Likker'', and began selling copies of it in 1999 out of his junk shop in Maggie Valley.&lt;ref name=NYTMicro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0970162804|title=Me and My Likker |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PamAffidavit&gt;{{cite web |first=Pamela L. |last=Sutton |title=Affidavit of Pamela Sutton |url=http://web.knoxnews.com/pdf/2010/dec/121310popcorn_affidavit.pdf |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' later called it "a rambling, obscene, and often hilarious account of his life in the trade".&lt;ref name=NYTMicro/&gt; (A woman named Ernestine Upchurch, with whom Sutton had been living in the 1990s, later said she helped write the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=Satterfield |title='Likker' tales in legal battle: Moonshiner Popcorn Sutton's widow, daughter split over rights to book |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/likker-tales-in-legal-battle-moonshiner-popcorn-suttons-widow-daughter-split-over-rights-to-boo-ep-4-358254741.html |newspaper=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]] |date=December 13, 2010 |accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Pamela L. |last=Reeves |authorlink=Pamela L.

{{quote|He was a short, skinny fella, who always wore his hat{{snd}}that was kind of his claim to fame, his hat that he always wore. And his bib overalls{{snd}}he always wore bib overalls. Even when he came to federal court, he was wearing bib overalls. He was a friendly fellow, and of course every time you would talk to him, he would say, "Ray, I've run my last run of moonshine, I'm not gonna do it anymore, I'm just getting too old to be doing this stuff."|Radio reporter Ray Snader on "Popcorn" Sutton, 2009.&lt;ref name=Mother2010&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Murphy |url=http://motherjones.com/road-trip-blog/2010/07/last-days-popcorn-sutton |title=Tales of the Last Moonshiner |magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=11 July 2010 |accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His first appearance in a [[feature film]] (that was not self-published) was in Neal Hutcheson's 2002 documentary, ''Mountain Talk'', as one of various people of southern Appalachia featured in this film focused on the "mountain dialect" of the area.&lt;ref name=Golden/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1432153|Mountain Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutton next appeared in another Hutcheson film that would become the cornerstone of his notoriety, called ''This is the Last Dam Run of Likker I'll Ever Make''. Filmed and released in 2002, the film quickly became a cult classic and over time drew the attention of television producers in Boston and New York.

In 2007, a fire on Sutton's property in Parrottsville led to firefighters discovering 650 gallons of untaxed alcohol there, for which he was convicted and put on probation again by Cocke County authorities.&lt;ref name=Famed18/&gt;

Sutton was featured in the 2007 documentary ''Hillbilly: The Real Story'' on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].&lt;ref name=APObit/&gt; The source footage from the 2002 documentary was also re-worked into another Hutcheson documentary, ''The Last One'', which was released in 2008 and was broadcast on [[PBS]]. It received a 2009 [[Southeast Emmy Awards|Southeast Emmy Award]].&lt;ref name=Golden/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=http://www.suckerpunchpictures.com/last_one_popcorn_sutton.html |title=The Last One |website=Sucker Punch Pictures |accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1334253|The Last One}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Sutton told an undercover federal officer that he had 500 gallons of moonshine in Tennessee and another 400 gallons in Maggie Valley that he was ready to sell.&lt;ref name=Famed18/&gt; This led to a raid of his property by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], led by Jim Cavanaugh of [[Waco siege]] notoriety,&lt;ref name=Landess&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/2009/06/01/marvin-popcorn-sutton-rip/ |title=Marvin 'Popcorn' Sutton, R.I.P. |date=June 1, 2009 |first=Tom |last=Landess |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103032335/http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/2009/06/01/marvin-popcorn-sutton-rip/ |archivedate=November 3, 2011 |magazine=[[Chronicles (magazine)|Chronicles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/21320458/waco-20-years-later-the-atf-raid |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190610/http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/21320458/waco-20-years-later-the-atf-raid |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, Sutton, who had used a [[public defender]] as his attorney in the case and had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 18 months in a federal prison for illegally distilling spirits and possession of a firearm as a felon (a [[.38 caliber|.38-caliber]] [[handgun]]).&lt;ref name=NYTMicro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Famed18&gt;{{cite news|title=Famed moonshiner gets 18 months|date=January 26, 2009|accessdate=March 29, 2009|work=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20090126/news/901260263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sutton, 62 and recently diagnosed with [[cancer]], asked the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee|U.S. District]] Judge [[J.

==Death and memorial services==
Sutton committed [[suicide]] by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] on March 16, 2009, apparently to avoid a federal prison term due to begin a few days later.

Sutton's body was initially interred at a family graveyard in [[Mount Sterling, North Carolina]]. However, on October 24, 2009, it was relocated to his property in Parrottsville, and a public memorial service was held. His body was carried to its new resting spot by horse and carriage. Sutton's memorial grew in spectacle as country music singer [[Hank Williams Jr.]] flew in to pay his respects. A small memorial was also held for close friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Matheny |first=Jim |url=http://www.wbir.com/news/watercooler/story.aspx?storyid=102677&amp;catid=141 |title=Hundreds honor memory of legendary moonshiner |website=[[WBIR-TV]] |place=[[Knoxville, Tennessee]] |date=October 25, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popcorn Sutton's Tennessee White Whiskey==
[[File:Popcorn Sutton Tennessee White Whiskey.jpg|thumb|right|A bottle of the namesake whiskey ({{circa}} 2013)]]

On November 9, 2010, [[Hank Williams Jr.]] announced his partnership with J&amp;M Concepts LLC and widow Pam Sutton to distill and distribute a brand of whiskey named after Sutton that was asserted to follow his legacy.&lt;ref name="blogs.tennessean.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooper |first=Peter |url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/11/12/hank-williams-jr-helps-continue-popcorn-suttons-moonshine-legacy/ |title=Hank Williams, Jr. Helps Continue Popcorn Sutton's Moonshine Legacy |newspaper=[[The Tennessean]] |date=November 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707213408/http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/11/12/hank-williams-jr-helps-continue-popcorn-suttons-moonshine-legacy/ |archivedate=July 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed "Popcorn Sutton's Tennessee White Whiskey", it was marketed as having been produced on stills designed by Sutton using his secret family recipe and techniques Sutton entrusted to former Supercross professional [[Jamey Grosser]] of J&amp;M Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanford |first=Jason |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/citizen_times/access/2192962581.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+13%2C+2010&amp;author=Jason+Sandford&amp;pub=Asheville+Citizen+-+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=n%2Fa&amp;desc=Popcorn+Sutton%27s+whiskey+goes+legit+with+Hank+Williams+Jr.%27s+stamp+of+approval |title=Popcorn Sutton's whiskey goes legit with Hank Williams Jr.'s stamp of approval |newspaper=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]] |date=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Country music stars attending the launch event included [[Martina McBride]], [[Jamey Johnson]], [[Randy Houser]], [[Travis Tritt]], [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Zac Brown]], [[Josh Thompson (singer)|Josh Thompson]], [[Kentucky Headhunters]], [[Little Big Town]], [[Colt Ford]], [[Montgomery Gentry]], [[Jaron and the Long Road to Love]], and [[Lee Brice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hackett |first=Vernell |url=http://www.theboot.com/2010/11/11/hank-williams-jr-moonshine/ |title=Hank Williams, Jr. Gets into the Moonshine Business |website=The Boot |date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to press reports, Popcorn Sutton's Tennessee White Whiskey would be initially distributed in [[Tennessee]] and throughout the southeast.

On October 25, 2013, [[Jack Daniel's]] Properties, Inc. filed suit against the distiller of Popcorn Sutton's whiskey, claiming that the newly redesigned bottle, with its square shape, beveled shoulders, and white-on-black label, too closely resembled their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jack-daniels-legal-fight-small-distiller-151734616.html |title=Jack Daniel's in legal fight with small distiller |website=[[Yahoo!

The suit asked that all current existing bottles be taken off the market and that all profits from the sales of those bottles be handed over to Jack Daniel's. The lawsuit was settled in 2014 with undisclosed terms,&lt;ref name=Master&gt;Schelzig, Eric, "[https://news.yahoo.com/dickel-master-distiller-leaving-head-145524620.html Dickel master distiller leaving to head Popcorn Sutton]", [[Yahoo News]] via [[Associated Press]], March 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and as of May 2016, the Sutton brand's bottle design has been substantially changed. The brand now uses a round bottle with a light silver background color.&lt;ref name=Official&gt;{{official website|http://popcornsutton.com/ |Popcorn Sutton whiskey}}, official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Popcorn Sutton Distilling opened a new distillery in [[Newport, Tennessee]], the [[county seat]] of Cocke County.&lt;ref name=NTN/&gt; Copper stills for the facility were made by Vendome Copper and Brass in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;Press Release [http://www.websterpr.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=412:hank-tips-a-hat--and-a-glass--to-popcorn-suttons-tennessee-white-whiskey&amp;catid=10:hank-williams-jr&amp;Itemid=15 "Hank Tips a Hat – and a Glass – To Popcorn Sutton's Tennessee White Whiskey"],{{dead link|date=June 2018}} November 10, 2010.{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CEO]] of Popcorn Sutton Distilling is Megan Kvamme.&lt;ref name=Master/&gt;

In March 2015, it was announced that John Lunn, who had until then been master distiller of [[George Dickel]] [[Tennessee whiskey]] since 2005, would be joining Popcorn Sutton Distilling as its new master distiller.&lt;ref name=Master/&gt; In July 2016, it was announced Allisa Henley, long time employee and Master Distiller at George Dickel, would join her former protege John Lunn at Popcorn Sutton Distilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Another Dickel Distiller, Alisa Henley, Leaves for Popcorn Sutton |url=http://thewhiskeywash.com/american-whiskey/another-dickel-distiller-allisa-henry-leaves-popcorn-sutton/ |date=July 18, 2016 |first=Cary Ann |last=Fuller |work=The Whiskey Wash |access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the Popcorn Sutton Distillery was sold to the [[Sazerac Company]]. The sale included only the distillery, not the brands, which are owned by Popcorn Sutton Distilling LLC, which is based in Ohio.

[[File:No Berlusconi Day - Rome, Italy 05 December 2009.jpg|thumb|right|No Berlusconi Day, Rome, 5 December 2009]]
The '''Purple People''' (Italian: '''Il Popolo Viola''') were an [[Italy|Italian]] mass protest movement who, among other things, called for the resignation of now former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. The movement was dissaffected with mainstream Italian politics, and identified themselves at demonstrations and rallies by wearing items of the colour [[purple]], chosen because it was not associated with any major [[List of political parties in Italy|Italian political party]]. The group originated in October 2009 when a group of bloggers, gravitating around the anonymous figure of "San Precario" (English: "Saint Precarious"), an activist from [[Catania]], [[Sicily]], organised demonstrations using word of mouth, [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].

In October, 2009, they launched the [[Facebook]] page "Una Manifestazione Nazionale per Chiedere le Dimissioni di Berlusconi",  (English: "A National Demonstration to Ask for Berlusconi’s Resignation"), announcing a demonstration to take place in [[Rome]] on 5 December 2009. The page immediately reached an unexpected consensus. Only a few weeks after, more than 300,000 users had joined the page and had announced via [[Facebook]] their presence at the event, which would be called "[[No Berlusconi Day]]". Contemporaneously, hundreds of local groups sprung joining the initiative, both inside and outside Italy. Thousands of young Italians, forced by a high level of youth unemployment to leave the Country and move abroad, planned parallel campaigns in cities such as [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Sydney]], and many others. Since then, thousands of people have attended several subsequent rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/14714/1/Lorenzo_CORETTI_2014.pdf|title=The Purple Movement: Social Media and Activism in Berlusconi’s Italy|last=Coretti|first=Lorenzo|publisher=University of Westminster, Phd Thesis|year=2014|isbn=|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement declined after the successful campaign of the [[referendum]] of 15 June 2011, but, as of May 2016, its [[Facebook]] page is still active, counting more than 420,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/popviola/?fref=ts|title=Facebook Page "Il Popolo Viola"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book of [[Acts 19|Acts of the Apostles]], he had seven sons who attempted to exorcise a demon from a man in the town of [[Ephesus]] by using the name of [[Jesus]] as an invocation. This practice is similar to the Jewish practice, originating in the [[Testament of Solomon]], of invoking Angels to cast out demons.&lt;ref name="arnold7"/&gt; Because of the emphasis on healing and spiritual authority in the ministry of Sceva, it may be accurate to think of him as a [[Shaman]] figure for the Jewish communities in which he worked.&lt;ref name="arnold7"/&gt;

'''Scrooge McDuck''' is a fictional character created in 1947 by [[Carl Barks]] as a [[work-for-hire]] for [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Scrooge is an elderly Scottish [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[American Pekin duck|Pekin duck]] with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a red or blue [[frock coat]], [[top hat]], [[pince-nez]] glasses, and [[Spat (footwear)|spats]]. He is portrayed in animations as speaking with a [[Scottish accent]].

Named after [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] from the 1843 novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', Scrooge is an incredibly wealthy [[business magnate]] and self-proclaimed "adventure-capitalist" whose dominant character trait is his [[frugality|thrift]]. He is brother to [[Matilda McDuck]] and [[Hortense McDuck]], the maternal uncle of [[Della Duck|Della]] and [[Donald Duck]], the [[grand-uncle]] of [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], and a usual financial backer of [[Gyro Gearloose]]. Within the context of the fictional [[Donald Duck universe|Duck universe]], he is the world's richest person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Film Theorists|title=Film Theory: Scrooge McDuck's Net Worth SOLVED! (Disney's DuckTales)|date=2017-08-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-hQf-F3hyU|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an oil tycoon, businessman, owner of the largest mining concerns, many factories to operate different activities. His "Money Bin"—and indeed Scrooge himself—are often used as a humorous [[metonym]]s for great wealth in popular culture around the world.

McDuck was initially characterized as a greedy [[miser]] and [[antihero]] (as [[Charles Dickens]]' original Scrooge was), but in later appearances he has often been portrayed as a charitable and thrifty [[hero]], adventurer and explorer. He was originally created by Barks as an [[antagonist]] for [[Donald Duck]], first appearing in the 1947 ''[[Four Color]]'' story ''[[Christmas on Bear Mountain]]'' (#178). However, McDuck's popularity grew so large that he became a major figure of the [[Duck universe]]. In 1952 he was given his own comic book series, called ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'', which still runs today.

Scrooge was most famously drawn by his creator Carl Barks, and later by [[Don Rosa]]. Like other Disney franchise characters, Scrooge McDuck's international popularity has resulted in literature that is often translated into other languages. Comics have remained Scrooge's primary medium, although he has also appeared in [[animated cartoon]]s, most extensively in the television series ''[[DuckTales]]'' (1987–1990) and its [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|reboot]] as the main protagonist of both series.

==Comics history==
===First appearance===
{{details|Christmas on Bear Mountain}}
[[File:ScroogeFirst.jpg|right|frame|One of Scrooge's first panels in ''Christmas on Bear Mountain'']]

Scrooge McDuck, maternal uncle of previously established character [[Donald Duck]], made his first named appearance in the story ''Christmas on Bear Mountain'' which was published in Dell's Four Color Comics #178, December 1947, written and drawn by artist [[Carl Barks]]. His appearance may have been based on a similar-looking, Scottish "thrifty saver" Donald Duck character from the 1943 propaganda short ''[[The Spirit of '43]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gerstein|Gerstein, David]], "[http://nafsk.se/pipermail/dcml/2003-April/016580.html 1st Scrooge McDuck in 1943??]", Retrieved on October 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In ''Christmas on Bear Mountain'',&lt;ref&gt;{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=W+OS++178-02|Title= Christmas on Bear Mountain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrooge was a bearded, bespectacled, reasonably wealthy old duck, visibly leaning on his cane, and living in isolation in a "huge mansion".&lt;ref name="bearmountain"&gt;[[Carl Barks|Barks, Carl]] (writer and illustrator). "[[Christmas on Bear Mountain]]". ''[[Four Color Comics]]'' #178, ''[[Donald Duck]]''. July 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Scrooge's [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] thoughts in this first story are quite pronounced: ''"Here I sit in this big lonely dump, waiting for Christmas to pass! Bah! That silly season when everybody loves everybody else! A curse on it! Me—I'm different! Everybody hates me, and I hate everybody!"''&lt;ref name="bearmountain" /&gt;

Barks later reflected, "Scrooge in 'Christmas on Bear Mountain' was only my first idea of a rich, old uncle. I had made him too old and too weak. I discovered later on that I had to make him more active. I could not make an old guy like that do the things I wanted him to do."&lt;ref&gt;Ortman, Steve (trans.); Laqua, Charsten, "[http://moneybin.at.infoseek.co.jp/author.html Carl Barks – the Author] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064402/http://moneybin.at.infoseek.co.jp/author.html |date=June 12, 2007 }}", Carl Barks His Work and His Life (site). Retrieved on September 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring character===
Barks would later claim that he originally only intended to use Scrooge as a one-shot character, but then decided Scrooge (and his fortune) could prove useful for motivating further stories. Barks continued to experiment with Scrooge's appearance and personality over the next four years.

Scrooge's second appearance, in ''[[The Old Castle's Secret]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=W+OS++189-02|Title=The Old Castle's Secret}}&lt;/ref&gt; (first published in June 1948), had Scrooge recruiting his nephews to search for a family treasure hidden in Dismal Downs, the McDuck family's ancestral castle, built in the middle of [[Rannoch Moor]] in Scotland. ''[[Foxy Relations]]'' (first published in November 1948) was the first story where Scrooge is called by his title and [[catchphrase]] "The Richest Duck in the World".

[[File:ScroogeMcDuck Comic.jpg|frame|right|A panel from an Uncle Scrooge comic by [[Jack Bradbury]]]]

===First hints of Scrooge's past===
The story, ''[[Voodoo Hoodoo]]'', first published in Dell's Four Color Comics #238, August 1949, was the first story to hint at Scrooge's past with the introduction of two figures from it. The first was Foola Zoola, an old African sorcerer and chief of the [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] tribe who had cursed Scrooge, seeking revenge for the destruction of his village and the taking of his tribe's lands by Scrooge decades ago.

Scrooge privately admitted to his nephews that he had used an army of "cutthroats" to get the tribe to abandon their lands, in order to establish a [[Rubber#Cultivation|rubber plantation]]. The event was placed by Carl Barks in 1879 during the story, but it would later be [[retcon]]ned by Don Rosa to 1909 to fit with Scrooge's later-established personal history. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The second figure was [[Bombie the Zombie]], the organ of the sorcerer's curse and revenge. He had reportedly sought Scrooge for decades before reaching Duckburg, mistaking Donald for Scrooge.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Barks, with a note of [[skepticism]] often found in his stories, explained the zombie as a living person who has never died, but has somehow gotten under the influence of a sorcerer. Although some scenes of the story were intended as a [[parody]] of [[Bela Lugosi]]'s ''[[White Zombie (movie)|White Zombie]]'', the story is the first to not only focus on Scrooge's past but also touch on the darkest aspects of his personality.

===Later stories===
''[[Trail of the Unicorn]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=W+OS++263-03|Title=Trail of the Unicorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; first published in February 1950, introduced Scrooge's private [[zoo]]. One of his pilots had managed to photograph the last living [[unicorn]], which lived in the Indian part of the [[Himalayas]]. Scrooge offered a reward to competing cousins Donald Duck and [[Gladstone Gander]], which would go to the one who captured the unicorn for Scrooge's collection of animals.

This was also the story that introduced Scrooge's private airplane. Barks would later establish Scrooge as an experienced aviator. Donald had previously been shown as a skilled aviator, as was [[Flintheart Glomgold]] in later stories. In comparison, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] were depicted as only having taken flying lessons in the story ''[[Frozen Gold]]'' (published in January 1945).

''[[The Pixilated Parrot]]'', first published in July 1950, introduced the precursor to Scrooge's money bin; in this story, Scrooge's central office building is said to contain "three [[Cube (arithmetic)|cubic]] acres of money". Two nameless burglars who briefly appear during the story are considered to be the precursors of the [[Beagle Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Andrae|Andrae, Thomas]] Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity. Jackson, Miss: Univ. Press Mississippi, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scrooge as a major character===
''[[The Magic Hourglass]]'', first published in September 1950, was arguably the first story to change the focus of the Duck stories from Donald to Scrooge. During the story, several themes were introduced for Scrooge.

Donald first mentions in this story that his uncle practically owns Duckburg, a statement that Scrooge's rival [[John D. Rockerduck]] would later put in dispute. Scrooge first hints that he was not born into wealth, as he remembers buying the Hourglass in [[Morocco]] when he was a member of a ship's crew as a cabin boy. It is also the first story in which Scrooge mentions speaking another language besides his native English and reading other alphabets besides the [[Latin alphabet]], as during the story, he speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and reads the [[Arabic alphabet]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The latter theme would be developed further in later stories. Barks and current Scrooge writer [[Don Rosa]] have depicted Scrooge as being fluent in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], German, [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], Spanish, [[Maya language|Mayan]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]]. Scrooge acquired this knowledge from years of living or traveling to the various regions of the world where those languages are spoken. Later writers would depict Scrooge having at least working knowledge of several other languages.

Scrooge was shown in ''The Magic Hourglass'' in a more positive light than in previous stories, but his more villainous side is present too. Scrooge is seen in this story attempting to reacquire a magic [[hourglass]] that he gave to Donald, before finding out that it acted as a protective charm for him. Scrooge starts losing one billion dollars each minute, and comments that he will go bankrupt within 600 years. This line is a parody of [[Orson Welles]]'s line in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' "You know, Mr.&amp;nbsp;Thatcher, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in... 60 years".&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/quotes Citizen Kane quotes] from the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; To convince his nephews to return it, he pursues them throughout Morocco, where they had headed to earlier in the story. Memorably during the story, Scrooge interrogates Donald by having him tied up and tickled with a feather in an attempt to get Donald to reveal the hourglass's location. Scrooge finally manages to retrieve it, exchanging it for a flask of water, as he had found his nephews exhausted and left in the desert with no supplies. As Scrooge explains, he intended to give them a higher offer, but he just could not resist having somebody at his mercy without taking advantage of it.

===Final developments===
''[[A Financial Fable]]'', first published in March 1951, had Scrooge teaching Donald some lessons in productivity as the source of wealth, along with the laws of [[supply and demand]]. Perhaps more importantly, it was also the first story where Scrooge observes how diligent and industrious Huey, Louie and Dewey are, making them more similar to himself rather than to Donald. Donald in Barks's stories is depicted as working hard on occasion, but given the choice often proves to be a shirker. The three younger nephews first side with Scrooge rather than Donald in this story, with the bond between granduncle and grandnephews strengthening in later stories. However, there have been rare instances where Donald proved invaluable to Scrooge, such as when the group traveled back in time to Ancient Egypt to retrieve a pharaoh's [[papyrus]]. Donald cautions against taking it with him, as no one would believe the story unless it was unearthed. Donald then buries it and makes a marking point from the [[Nile River]], making Scrooge think to himself admiringly, "Donald must have swallowed the {{Sic|[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|hide=yes}}!"

''[[Terror of the Beagle Boys]]'', first published in November 1951, introduced the readers to the Beagle Boys, although Scrooge in this story seems to be already familiar with them. ''[[The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill]]'' introduced Scrooge's [[money bin]], built on Killmotor Hill in the center of Duckburg.

By this point, Scrooge had become familiar to readers in the United States and Europe. Other Disney writers and artists besides Barks began using Scrooge in their own stories, including Italian writer [[Romano Scarpa]]. [[Western Publishing]], the then-publisher of the Disney crafty comics, started thinking about using Scrooge as a protagonist rather than a supporting character, and then decided to launch Scrooge in his own self-titled comic. ''Uncle Scrooge'' #1, featuring the story ''[[Only a Poor Old Man]]'', was published in March 1952. This story along with ''[[Back to the Klondike]]'', first published a year later in March 1953, became the biggest influences in how Scrooge's character, past, and beliefs would become defined.

After this point, Barks produced most of his longer stories in ''Uncle Scrooge'', with a focus mainly on adventure, while his ten-page stories for [[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]] continued to feature Donald as the star and focused on comedy. In Scrooge's stories, Donald and his nephews were cast as Scrooge's assistants, who accompanied Scrooge in his adventures around the world. This change of focus from Donald to Scrooge was also reflected in stories by other contemporary writers. Since then, Scrooge remains a central figure of the Duck comics' universe, thus the coining of the term "[[Scrooge McDuck Universe]]".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Modern era===
After Barks's retirement, the character continued under other artists. In 1972, Barks was persuaded to write more stories for Disney. He wrote [[Junior Woodchuck]] stories where Scrooge often plays the part of the villain, closer to the role he had before he acquired his own series. Under Barks, Scrooge always was a malleable character who would take on whatever persona was convenient to the plot.

The Italian writer and artist [[Romano Scarpa]] made several additions to Scrooge McDuck's universe, including characters such as [[Brigitta McBridge]], Scrooge's self-styled fiancée, and [[Gideon McDuck]], a newspaper editor who is Scrooge's brother. Those characters have appeared mostly in European comics. So is also the case for Scrooge's rival [[John D. Rockerduck]] (created by Barks for just one story) and Donald's cousin [[Fethry Duck]], who sometimes works as a reporter for Scrooge's newspaper.

Another major development was the arrival of writer and artist [[Don Rosa]] in 1986 with his story "[[The Son of the Sun]]", released by [[Gladstone Publishing]] and nominated for a [[Harvey Award]], one of the comics industry's highest honors. Rosa has said in interviews that he considers Scrooge to be his favorite Disney character. Unlike most other Disney writers, Don Rosa considered Scrooge as a historical character whose Disney adventures had occurred in the fifties and sixties and ended (in his undepicted death&lt;ref&gt;{{INDUCKSCode|Type=story|Code=GC+HD++77B|Title=Don Rosa's artwork}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1967 when Barks retired. He considered only Barks' stories canonical, and fleshed out a timeline as well as a family tree based on Barks' stories. Eventually he wrote and drew ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', a full history in twelve chapters which received an [[Eisner Award]] in 1995. Later editions included additional chapters. Under Rosa, Scrooge became more ethical; while he never cheats, he ruthlessly exploits any loopholes. He owes his fortune to his hard work and his money bin is "full of souvenirs" since every coin reminds him of a specific circumstance. Rosa remains the foremost contemporary duck artist and has been nominated for five 2007 Eisner Awards. His work is regularly reprinted by itself as well as along with Barks stories for which he created a sequel.

[[Daan Jippes]], who can mimic Barks's art to a close extent, repenciled all of Barks's 1970s Junior Woodchucks stories, as well as Barks' final Uncle Scrooge stories, from the 1990s to the early 2000s. Other notable Disney artists who have worked with the Scrooge character include [[Marco Rota]], [[William Van Horn]], and [[Tony Strobl]].

In an interview with the Norwegian "Aftenposten" from 1992 Don Rosa says that "in the beginning Scrooge [owed] his existence to his nephew Donald, but that has changed and today it's Donald that [owes] his existence to Scrooge" and he also says that this is one of the reasons why he is so interested in Scrooge.

==Characterization==
===Wealth===
[[File:Scroogeswim.jpg|left|thumb|Scrooge's signature dive into money]]
The character is almost exclusively portrayed as having worked his way up the financial ladder from [[Working class|humble immigrant roots]].

The comic book series ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', written and drawn by [[Don Rosa]], shows Scrooge as a young boy, he took up a job polishing and shining boots in his native [[Glasgow]]. A pivotal moment comes when a ditchdigger pays him with an [[United States Seated Liberty coinage|1875 US dime]], which was useless as currency in 19th century [[Glasgow]]. Enraged, Scrooge vowed to never be taken advantage of again, to be "sharper than the sharpies and smarter than the smarties." He takes a position as cabin boy on a Clyde cattle ship to the United States to make his fortune at the age of 13. In 1898, after many adventures he finally ends up in Klondike, where he finds a golden rock the size of a goose's egg. By the following year he had made his first $1,000,000 and bought the deed for Killmule Hill from Casey Coot, the son of Clinton Coot and grandson of Cornelius Coot, the founder of Duckburg. He finally ends up in Duckburg in 1902. After some dramatic events where he faces both the Beagle Boys and president Roosevelt and his "[[Rough Riders]]" at the same time, he tears down the rest of the old fort Duckburg and builds his famous Money Bin at the site.

In the years to follow, Scrooge travels all around the world in order to increase his fortune, while his family remained behind to manage the Money Bin. When Scrooge finally returns to Duckburg, he is the richest [[duck]] in the world, rivaled only by [[Flintheart Glomgold]], [[John D. Rockerduck]], and less prominently, the [[maharaja]] of the [[fictional country]] Howdoyoustan (play on [[Hindustan]]). His experiences, however, had changed him into a hostile miser, and he made his own family leave.{{elucidate|date=August 2015}} Some 12 years later, he closed his empire down, but eventually returned to a public life five years later and started his business.

He keeps the majority of his wealth in a massive Money Bin overlooking the city of Duckburg. In the short ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'', he remarks to his nephews that this money is "just [[petty cash]]". In the Dutch and Italian version he regularly forces Donald and his nephews to polish the coins one by one in order to pay off Donald's debts; Scrooge will not pay them much for this lengthy, tedious, hand-breaking work. As far as he is concerned, even 5 cents an hour is too much expenditure.

A shrewd businessman and noted tightwad, he is fond of diving into and swimming in his money, without injury. He is also the richest member of The Billionaires Club of Duckburg, a society which includes the most successful businessmen of the world and allows them to keep connections with each other. Glomgold and Rockerduck are also influential members of the Club. His most famous prized possession is his [[Number One Dime]].

[[File:Scroogemoney.jpg|right|thumb|Valuation of Scrooge assets in Barks' ''The Second Richest Duck'']]
The sum of Scrooge's wealth is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbarks.dk/theserieswealth.htm|title=theserieswealth|website=cbarks.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barks' ''The Second Richest Duck'' as noted by a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article, Scrooge is worth "one multiplujillion, nine obsquatumatillion, six hundred twenty-three dollars and sixty-two cents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,921233,00.html | title=The Duck with the Bucks |last= Cocks| first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Cocks |date=May 17, 1982 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''DuckTales'' episode "Liquid Assets", [[Fenton Crackshell]] (Scrooge's accountant) notes that McDuck's money bin contains "607 tillion 386 zillion 947 trillion 522 billion dollars and 36 cents". Don Rosa's ''Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck'' notes that Scrooge amounts to "five multiplujillion, nine impossibidillion, seven fantastica trillion dollars and sixteen cents". A thought bubble from Scrooge McDuck sitting in his car with his chauffeur in ''Walt Disney's Christmas Parade'' No.1 (published in 1949) that takes place in the story "Letter to Santa" clearly states "What's the use of having 'eleven octillion dollars' if I don't make a big noise about it?" In ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'', Scrooge mentions "We quadzillionaires have our own ideas of fun." In the first episode of the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 DuckTales series]], Scrooge states that he runs "a multi-trillion dollar business".

''[[Forbes]]'' magazine has occasionally tried to estimate Scrooge's wealth in real terms; in 2007, the magazine estimated his wealth at $28.8 billion;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/11/richest-fictional-characters-oped-books-fict1507-cx_mn_de_1211fictional15_land.html | title=The Forbes Fictional 15 |author=Noer, Michael (ed.) |author2=Ewalt, David M.

Using 4 different methodologies to calculate the volume of actual gold in Scrooge's money bin (depth gauge, ladder length, blueprints, and 3 cubic acres), the four amounts from most conservative to "more money than the entire planet Earth" the amounts were: $52,348,493,767.50 (depth gauge), $239,307,400,080 (ladder), $12,434,013,552,490 (blueprints), $333,927,633,863,527 (3 cubic acres); with each valuation based on a then current gold price of $1243.30 per troy ounce. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-hQf-F3hyU Film Theorists, TV Theories S1 E3, Film Theory: Scrooge McDuck's Net Worth Solved (Disney's DuckTales), published August 8,2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the amount, Scrooge never considers it to be enough; he believes that he has to continue to earn money by any means possible. A [[running gag]] is Scrooge always making profit on any business deal.&lt;ref&gt;[Walt Disney "Golden Key" Comics Digest #January 19, 1970 "Much Luck McDuck"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Scrooge never completed a formal education, as he left school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is always ready to learn new skills. Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter, Scrooge has become something of a scholar and an amateur [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]. Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to a treasure. Often Scrooge decides to search for the possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition.

As a result of his research, Scrooge has built up an extensive personal library, which includes many rare tomes. In Barks's and Rosa's stories, among the prized pieces of this library is an almost complete collection of Spanish and Dutch naval logs of the 16th and 17th centuries. Their references to the fates of other ships have often allowed Scrooge to locate sunken ships and recover their treasures from their watery graves. Mostly self-taught as he is, Scrooge is a firm believer in the saying "knowledge is power". Scrooge is also an accomplished [[linguist]] and entrepreneur, having learned to speak several different languages during his business trips around the world, selling refrigerators to [[Eskimo]]s, wind to windmill manufacturers in the [[Netherlands]], etc.

===Morality and beliefs===
Both as a businessman and as a treasure hunter, Scrooge is noted for his drive to set new goals and face new challenges. As Carl Barks described his character, for Scrooge there is "always another rainbow". The phrase later provided the title for one of Barks's better-known paintings depicting Scrooge. Periods of inactivity between adventures and lack of serious challenges tend to be depressing for Scrooge after a while; some stories see these phases take a toll on his health. Scrooge's other motto is "Work smarter, not harder."

As a businessman, Scrooge often resorts to aggressive tactics and deception. He seems to have gained significant experience in manipulating people and events towards his own ends. As often seen in stories by writer Guido Martina and occasionally by others, Scrooge is noted for his [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], especially towards ideals of [[morality]] when it comes to business and the pursuit of set goals. This has been noted by some as not being part of Barks's original profile of the character, but has since come to be accepted as one valid interpretation of Scrooge's way of thinking.

Scrooge seems to have a personal code of honesty that offers him an amount of self-control. He can often be seen contemplating the next course of action, divided between adopting a ruthless pursuit of his current goal against those tactics he considers more honest. At times, he can sacrifice his goal in order to remain within the limits of this sense of honesty. Several fans of the character have come to consider these depictions as adding to the depth of his personality, because based on the decisions he takes Scrooge can be both the [[hero]] and the [[villain]] of his stories. This is one thing he has in common with his nephew [[Donald Duck|Donald]]. Scrooge's sense of honesty also distinguishes him from his rival [[Flintheart Glomgold]], who places no such self-limitations. During the cartoon series ''DuckTales'', at times he would be heard saying to Glomgold, "You're a cheater, and cheaters ''never'' prosper!"

Scrooge has a volatile temper and rarely hesitates to use cartoon violence against those who provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, he seems to be against the use of lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in [[fairy tale]]s do bad people turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word—never breaking a promise once given.&lt;ref&gt;An example is when Scrooge, his family and the Beagle Boys are trapped in the past. Hatching a plan to return to their normal time, he is told they could easily leave the Beagles stranded in the past; Scrooge refuses, noting that he gave his word everyone would return safely.&lt;/ref&gt; In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.

Carl Barks gave Scrooge a definite set of ethics which were in tone with the time he was supposed to have made his fortune. The [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]] and industrialists of the 1890–1920s era were McDuck's competition as he earned his fortune. Scrooge proudly asserts "I made it by being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties! And I made it square!" Barks's creation is averse to dishonesty in the pursuit of wealth. When Disney filmmakers first contemplated a Scrooge feature cartoon in the fifties, the animators had no understanding of the Scrooge McDuck character and merely envisioned Scrooge as a duck version of Ebenezer Scrooge—a very unsympathetic character. In the end they shelved the idea because a duck who gets all excited about money just was not funny enough.

In an interview, Barks summed up his beliefs about Scrooge and [[capitalism]]:

{{quote|I've always looked at the ducks as caricatured human beings. In rereading the stories, I realized that I had gotten kind of deep in some of them: there was philosophy in there that I hadn't realized I was putting in. It was an added feature that went along with the stories. I think a lot of the philosophy in my stories is [[Traditionalist conservatism|conservative]]—conservative in the sense that I feel our civilization peaked around 1910. Since then we've been going downhill. Much of the older culture had basic qualities that the new stuff we keep hatching can never match.

Look at the magnificent cathedrals and palaces that were built. Nobody can build that sort of thing nowadays. Also, I believe that we should preserve many old ideals and methods of working: honor, honesty, allowing other people to believe in their own ideas, not trying to force everyone into one form. The thing I have against the present political system is that it tries to make everybody exactly alike. We should have a million different patterns.

They say that wealthy people like the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers are sinful because they accumulated fortunes by exploiting the poor. I feel that everybody should be able to rise as high as they can or want to, provided they don't kill anybody or actually oppress other people on the way up. A little exploitation is something you come by in nature. We see it in the pecking order of animals—everybody has to be exploited or to exploit someone else to a certain extent. I don't resent those things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barks|first=Carl|title=Carl Barks: Conversations|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-501-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Personality ===

Scrooge is very misunderstood. In his early years, he was very friendly and generous. But the 'slaps' of society from cruel people, as well as the ungratefulness of those who he had helped to overcome their problems, made Scrooge bitter, grumpy, and arrogant.  Feeling that he had been taken advantage of, he didn't want to believe that others had real problems or difficulties in their lives.  This made him seem out-of-touch at best, and selfish at worst.  As a result, no one could understand his problems, including his nephew, and his great-nephews. This isolation paved the path to acquiring untold wealth and power. But despite it all, he is very loyal, and will help those he sees as in-peril or need of help.

===''DuckTales''===
[[File:ScroogeWithNephews.jpg|thumb|left|Scrooge stars alongside his great-nephews in ''[[DuckTales]]'']]
In the ''[[DuckTales]]'' series, Scrooge has adopted the nephews (as Donald has joined the Navy and is away on his tour of duty), and as a result his darker personality traits are downplayed. While most of his persona remain from the comics, he is notably more [[Optimism|optimistic]] and less hot-headed in the animated cartoon. In an early episode, Scrooge credits his improved temperament to the nephews and Webby (his housekeeper's granddaughter, who comes to live in Scrooge's mansion), saying that "for the first time since I left [[Scotland]], I have a family". Though Scrooge is far from tyrannical in the comics, he is rarely so openly affectionate. While he still hunts for treasure in ''DuckTales'', many episodes focus on his attempts to thwart villains. However, he remains just as tightfisted with money as he has always been. But he's also affable and patient with his family and friends.

Scrooge displays a strict code of honor, insisting that the only valid way to acquire [[wealth]] is to "earn it square," and he goes to great lengths to thwart those (sometimes even his own nephews) who gain money dishonestly. This code also prevents him from ever being dishonest himself, and he avows that "Scrooge McDuck's word is as good as gold." He also expresses great disgust at being viewed by others as a greedy liar and cheater.

The series fleshes out Scrooge's upbringing by depicting his life as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest but also, he defends his family and friends from any dangers, including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer the most important thing in his life. For one episode, he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.

On occasion, he demonstrates considerable physical strength by single-handedly beating bigger foes. He credits his robustness to "lifting money bags."

===Europe===
Many of the European comics based on the Disney Universe have created their own version of Scrooge McDuck, usually involving him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s–1980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero dragging his long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or [[blunderbuss]], or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings up at the end of the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb – something which Scrooge shows little concern for – he tends to end up with nothing.

Another running joke is Scrooge reminiscing about his adventures while [[gold prospecting]] in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] much to Donald and the nephews' chagrin at hearing the never-ending and tiresome stories.

===Age===
According to Carl Barks' 1955 one-pager "Watt an Occasion" (''Uncle Scrooge'' #12), Scrooge is 75 years of age. According to Don Rosa, Scrooge was born in Scotland in 1867, and earned his Number One Dime (or First Coin) exactly ten years later. The ''DuckTales'' episodes (and many European comics) show a Scrooge who hailed from Scotland in the 19th century, yet was clearly familiar with all the technology and amenities of the 1980s. Despite this extremely advanced age, Scrooge does not appear to be on the verge of dotage, and is vigorous enough to keep up with his nephews in adventures; with rare exception there appears to be no sign of him slowing down.

Barks responded to some fan letters asking about Scrooge's Adamic age, that in the story "That's No Fable!", when Scrooge drank water from a [[Fountain of Youth]] for several days, rather than making him young again (bodily contact with the water was required for that), ingesting the water rejuvenated his body and cured him of his [[rheumatism|rheumatia]], which arguably allowed Scrooge to live beyond his expected years with no sign of slowdown or senility. Don Rosa's solution to the issue of Scrooge's age is that he set all of his stories in the 1950s or earlier, which was when he himself discovered and reveled in Barks's stories as a kid, and in his unofficial timelines, he had Scrooge die in 1967, at the age of 100 years.

In the 15th Episode of the 2017 ''DuckTales'' reboot, it is revealed that Scrooge was also stuck (by unmentioned time) in the Demigorgana timeless demon dimension which is used to explain his young look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ducktales.wikia.com/wiki/The_Golden_Lagoon_of_White_Agony_Plains!/Transcript|title=The Golden Lagoon of White Agony Plains!/Transcript|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Scrooge McDuck Universe===
{{Main|Duck universe}}
The popularity of Scrooge McDuck comics spawned an entire mythology around the character, including new supporting characters, adventures, and life experiences as told by numerous authors. The popularity of the [[Duck universe]] – the fandom term for the associated intellectual properties that have developed from Scrooge's stories over the years, including the city of [[Duckburg]] – has led Don Rosa to claim that "in the beginning Scrooge [owed] his existence to his nephew Donald, but that has changed and today it's Donald that [owes] his existence to Scrooge."

In addition to the many [[List of characters from the Scrooge McDuck universe|original and existing characters]] in stories about Scrooge McDuck, authors have frequently led historical figures to meet Scrooge over the course of his life. Most notably, Scrooge has met US president [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt and Scrooge would meet each other at least three times: in the Dakotas in 1883, in Duckburg in 1902, and in Panama in 1906. ''See [[List of characters from the Scrooge McDuck universe#Historical figures in Scrooge McDuck stories|Historical Figures in Scrooge McDuck stories]]''.

Based on writer [[Don Rosa]]'s ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', a popular timeline chronicling Scrooge's adventures was created consisting of the most important "facts" about Scrooge's life.

In 2014, composer [[Tuomas Holopainen]] of [[Nightwish]] released a conceptual album based on the book, ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''. The album is titled ''[[Music Inspired by the Life and Times of Scrooge]]''. [[Don Rosa]] illustrated the cover artwork for the album &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/don-rosa-tuomas-holopainen-nightwish-the-life-and-times-of-scrooge-album-art/|title=Don Rosa Draws For A Finnish Rock Album About Scrooge McDuck|website=ComicsAlliance|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===In other media===
The character of Scrooge has appeared in various mediums aside from comic books. Scrooge's voice was first heard on the 1960 record album ''Donald Duck and His Friends;'' [[Dal McKennon]] voiced the character for this appearance.&lt;ref name="cartoonresearch1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mickeys-christmas-carol/|title=“Mickey’s Christmas Carol” -|website=cartoonresearch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrooge's first appearance in animated form (save for a brief ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' television series cameo) was in Disney's 1967 theatrical short ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'' (voiced by [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]]), in which he teaches his nephews basic financial tips.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Bill (writer) &amp; Hamilton, Luske (director). ''[[Scrooge McDuck and Money]]'', [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]]. March 23, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Disneyland Records]] released an adaptation of the [[Charles Dickens]] classic ''[[A Christmas Carol]],'' for which [[Alan Young]] was hired to voice Scrooge McDuck playing the character who inspired his name, [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] (Thompson had died in 1971). Young, who himself was born in Great Britain, was best known for playing Wilbur Post on the hit television series ''[[Mister Ed]]'' from 1961 to 1965. Eight years later, the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] decided to make a [[featurette]] of this same story, this time dubbed ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983), and once again hired Young to voice the role.&lt;ref name="cartoonresearch1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Burny Mattinson|Mattinson, Burny]] (writer/director), Marino, Tony L. (writer), Gombert, Ed (writer), Griffith, Don (writer), [[Alan Young|Young, Alan]] (writer) &amp; Dinehart, Alan (writer). ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]]. December 16, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as himself in the television special ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' (1987) (the only time when he was voiced by [[Will Ryan]]).

Scrooge's biggest role outside comics would come in the 1987 [[animated series]] ''[[DuckTales]]'', a series loosely based on Carl Barks's comics, and where [[Alan Young]] returned to voice his character. In this series, premiered over two-hours on September 18, 1987, while the regular episodes began three days later, Scrooge becomes the legal guardian of Huey, Dewey and Louie when Donald joins the [[United States Navy]]. Scrooge's ''DuckTales'' persona is considerably mellow compared to most previous appearances; his aggression is played down and his often duplicitous personality is reduced in many episodes to that of a curmudgeonly but well-meaning old uncle. Still, there are flashes of Barks' Scrooge to be seen, particularly in early episodes of the first season. Scrooge also appeared in ''[[DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp]]'', released during the series' run. He was mentioned in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode "Tiff of the Titans", but never really seen.&lt;!--seen or not?--&gt;

He has appeared in some episodes of ''[[Raw Toonage]]'', two shorts of ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and some episodes (specially "House of Scrooge") of ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', as well as the [[direct-to-video]] films ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''. His video game appearances include the three ''DuckTales'' releases (''[[DuckTales (video game)|DuckTales]]'', ''[[DuckTales 2]]'', and ''[[DuckTales: The Quest for Gold]]''), and in ''[[Toontown Online]]'' as the accidental creator of the Cogs. Additionally, he is a secret playable character in 2008 quiz game, ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''. In the 2012 [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'', he is one of the first characters Mickey rescues, running a shop in the fortress selling upgrades and serving as a Sketch summon in which he uses his cane pogostick from the Ducktales NES games.

In 1961 a 45rpm single record was released entitled "Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge's Money Rocket" (aka "Uncle Scrooge's Rocket to the Moon"), a story of how Scrooge builds a rocket to send all his money to the moon to protect it from the "Beagle Boys".

[[File:Scrooge in KH2.jpg|thumb|Scrooge in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'']]
Scrooge also makes an appearance in Disney's and [[Square Enix]]'s ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, in a role where he helps Mickey Mouse set up a world transit system. He first appears in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' as a minor non-playable character in Hollow Bastion, where he is trying to recreate his favorite ice cream flavor – sea-salt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kazushige Nojima|Nojima, Kazushige]] (writer), [[Tetsuya Nomura|Nomura, Tetsuya]] (writer/director), Oka, Masaru (writer), Sakemi, Harunori (writer) &amp; Watanabe, Daisuke (writer). ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', [[Square Enix]] and [[Buena Vista Games]]. March 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Scrooge later appears in the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', this time with a speaking role. He works on establishing an ice-cream business in Radiant Garden and gives Ventus three passes to the Dream Festival in Disney Town. Young reprises the role in the English version of ''Birth by Sleep''.

Scrooge has appeared in the [[Boom! Studios]] ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' comic, playing a key role at the end of its initial story, "[[The Duck Knight Returns]]". Later he would also play a key role on the final story arc "[[Dangerous Currency]]", where he teams up with Darkwing Duck in order to stop the Phantom Blot and [[Magica De Spell]] from taking over St. Canard and Duckburg.

In 2015, Scrooge was seen in the ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' short "Goofy's First Love", where Mickey and Donald are trying to help Goofy find his love. Donald suggests money, and they head over to Scrooge's mansion where Donald tells his uncle that Goofy needs a million dollars. Scrooge then has his butler kick them out. When Goofy is inadvertently launched from a treadmill and catapulted off another building, he lands in Scrooge's mansion. The butler kicks Goofy out and the process repeats itself but this time Mickey and Donald are catapulted as well and kicked out by the butler. Scrooge is seen at the end attending Goofy's wedding with a sandwich. In the 2016 ''Mickey Mouse'' Christmas special, "Duck the Halls", after Young's death, [[John Kassir]] took over voicing Scrooge McDuck, however he later [[Twitter|tweeted]] that he won't be reprising his role in the reboot. Kassir continues to voice the character in subsequent appearances in this series. Scrooge makes a cameo appearance in the ''[[Legend of the Three Caballeros]]'' episode "Shangri-La-Di-Da", voiced by [[Eric Bauza]].

In the new ''DuckTales,'' Scrooge is played by Scottish actor [[David Tennant]], who brings both the nephews and Donald into his home at the end of the series premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2017/03/first-look-david-tennant-voices-scrooge-mcduck-in-ducktales|title=First Look: David Tennant Voices Scrooge McDuck in ‘DuckTales’ {{!}} BBC America|work=BBC America|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series shows that Scrooge previously adventured with his nephew Donald and his niece [[Della Duck]], but a tragic event ten years prior to the start of the series resulted in Scrooge and Donald going their separate ways. He seems to have a rather [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] attitude about family as a result, and is initially reluctant in spending time with the boys until they assist him in a couple of adventures.

'''Simon Stevens''' (born 1974) is an award-winning English activist, trainer, ''[[Huffington Post]]'' blogger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/simon-stevens/|title=Simon Stevens|work=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disability issues consultant known for his high-profile work around disability issues in the UK. Stevens was awarded a "Enterprising Young Brits" award in 2004&lt;ref name="Coventry Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2004/11/23/award-winner-simon-an-inspiration-92746-14903612/ |title= Award Winner Simon an Inspiration|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a "truly inspirational entrepreneur" for setting up Enable Enterprises in 1998.

In 2008, Stevens was presented with the Revolutionary Award, a category of the UK Catalyst Awards presented "For something that makes people in power more aware of the need for change." The award was presented to Stevens by then UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown for his founding of [[Wheelies]], a disability-themed nightclub in the online virtual world ''[[Second Life]]''. Stevens also featured in the disability-themed 2012 [[Channel 4]] hidden camera prank show ''[[I'm Spazticus]]''.&lt;ref name="Channel 4"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/im-spazticus/episode-guide/series-1/episode-5 |title= I'm Spazticus|accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Stevens was rated as one of "the ten most influential in the West Midlands from the world of social media" by Birmingham Mail.&lt;ref name ="Birmingham Mail"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/business/creative/birmingham-post-power-250-social-11124806 | title = Birmingham Post Power 250: Social Media |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in April 2013, he was rated 60th on the Disability News Service influence list, which according to the DNS website "highlight some of the many disabled people who make a difference in modern Britain.".&lt;ref name="Disability News Service"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://disabilitynewsservice.com/2013/04/influence-index-test-post |title= The List |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Updated in 2016, Stevens was then rated as one of "the ten people listed as the most influential in the West Midlands from the world of social media"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

However, within the disability community itself, Stevens is something of an outsider whose views do not reflect those of the majority. Indeed, to many he is nothing but a troublesome irrelevance.&lt;ref name ="pride's purge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tompride.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/oops-simon-stevens-in-his-defence-of-atos-forgets-to-mention-hes-employed-by-them/ |title=Oops! Simon Stevens in his defence of ATOS forgets to mention he's employed by them}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atosvictimsgroup.co.uk/tag/simon-stevens/|title=atosvictimsgroup.co.uk|publisher=atosvictimsgroup.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in Twitter debates, Simon adopts an argumentative style where he pretends he is drunk and fires illogical misspelled red-herrings at his opponents.

==Disability and health==
Stevens is affected by Cerebral Palsy, which, according to Stevens' site "affects my speech, mobility, hand control, balance and continence to a significant degree and provided me with a very good sense of humour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.simonstevens.com/ |title= Simon Stevens |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Stevens has been diagnosed as having mild bipolar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/simon-stevens/disabled-solidarity_b_3706474.html|title=Is Solidarity an Excuse for Disabled People Not to Work?|work=The Huffington Post UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009, Stevens had a nerve virus which resulted in long term Acute Neuropathy.&lt;ref name="Simon Stevens"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.simonstevens.com/ |title= Simon Stevens |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Second Life'' and Wheelies==
In 2006, Stevens became the first user of ''Second Life'' to use a wheelchair as part of his avatar character. He later founded the virtual club [[Wheelies]] the world's first disability-themed virtual nightclub in ''Second Life'', and "a friendly and inclusive place for disabled and non-disabled people from around the world to meet."&lt;ref name="ICT Parliment"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ictparliament.org/node/5245 |title= Simon Stevens: A High Flyer in Two Worlds |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==
Stevens claims to have worked with 149 companies, which are listed on his website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simonstevens.com/customers&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens has written extensively about efforts in UK schools to integrate persons with disabilities into the mainstream educational system. This work around "integration" and his own integration experiences have been used to illustrate improvements in the UK's integration systems since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="SEN Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.senmagazine.co.uk/articles/1036-my-life-with-cerebral-palsy.html |title= My life with cerebral palsy |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stevens has also been a national figure in "Go on Gold", a nationwide disability services campaign in the UK. Go ON Gold "aims to enable disabled users to use the internet, smartphones and digital TV to improve their day-to-day lives, access services and jobs and interact with a world which may previously have been out of reach."&lt;ref name="Coventry Telegraph 2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2012/08/23/coventry-man-leads-national-campaign-for-digital-inclusion-for-disabled-people-n-92746-31678581/2/ |title= Coventry Man leads national campaign for digital inclusion for disabled people |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Stevens has been a frequent guest blogger for the BBC website's disability blog "Ouch!"&lt;ref name="BBC Ouch"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/simon_stevens_guest_blogger/ |title= Simon Stevens BBC Ouch Blog|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written for Service User Voice.&lt;ref name="communitycare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communitycare.Co.UK/blogs/service-user-voice/personalization/ |title=Service User Voice |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From January 2011 to April 2013, Stevens was a board member for [[Skills for Care]] as a service user.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lid=11791&amp;sid=1135&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swami Abhedananda''' (2 October 1866 – 8 September 1939), born '''Kaliprasad Chandra''' was a [[Disciples of Ramakrishna|direct disciple]] of the 19th century mystic [[Ramakrishna Paramahansa]] and the founder of Ramakrishna Vedanta Math. [[Swami Vivekananda]] sent him to the West to head the [[Vedanta Society of New York]] in 1897, and spread the message of [[Vedanta]], a theme on which he authored several books through his life, and subsequently founded the Ramakrishna Vedanta Math, in [[Calcutta]] (now [[Kolkata]]) and [[Darjeeling]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Swami Abhedananda (1866-1939).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Swami Abhedananda, in his youth.]]
He was born in north [[Calcutta]] on 2 October 1866 and was named Kaliprasad Chandra.&lt;ref name=belu&gt;[http://www.belurmath.org/abhedananda.htm Biography] ''[[Belur Math]]'' Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Rasiklal Chandra and his mother was Nayantara Devi. In 1884, at the age of 18, while studying for the school final examination under the [[University of Calcutta]], he went to [[Dakshineswar]] and met [[Sri Ramakrishna]]. Thereafter in April 1885, he left home to be with him, during his final illness, first at Shyampukur and then at Cossipur Garden-house near Calcutta.

==Monastic life==
After his Master's death in 1886, he plunged into intense [[sadhana]] (meditations), by shutting himself up in a room at the [[Baranagar]] [[matha]], this gave him the name "Kali Tapaswi" amongst his fellow disciples.&lt;ref name=belu/&gt; After the death of Ramakrishna, he formally became a Sanyasi along with Vivekananda and others, and came to be known as "Swami Abhedananda".{{cn|date=July 2016}}

For the next ten years, of his life as a monk he travelled extensively throughout India, depending entirely on alms. During this time he met several famous sages like [[Pavhari Baba]], [[Trailanga Swami]] and [[Swami Bhaskaranand]]. He went to the sources of the [[Ganges]] and the [[Yamuna]], and meditated in the [[Himalayas]]. He was a forceful orator, prolific writer, [[yogi]] and intellectual with devotional fervour.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In 1896, Vivekananda was in London, when he asked Abhedananda to join him, and propagate the message of [[Vedanta]] in the West, which he did with great success. He went to USA in 1897, when Vivekananda asked him to take charge of the [[Vedanta Society]] in New York, here he preached messages of Vedanta and teachings of his [[Guru]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E3DF1139E433A25752C2A9659C94699ED7CF Swami Abhedananda of India Discusses the Subject at Mott Memorial Hall.] ''[[New York Times]]'', 21 March 1898, "He said that the belief in sin and sinners was a hindrance to realizing the unity of the individual soul with God"&lt;/ref&gt; for about 25 years, travelling far and wide to United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and Hong Kong. Finally, he returned to India in 1921, after attending the Pan-Pacific Education Conference at [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;

In 1922, he crossed the Himalayas on foot and reached [[Tibet]], where he studied Buddhistic philosophy and [[Lamaism]]. In Hemis Monastery, he claimed to have discovered a manuscript on the [[lost years of Jesus]],&lt;ref name=bangla/&gt; which has been incorporated in the book ''Swami Abhedananda's Journey into Kashmir &amp; Tibet'' published by the Ramakrishna Vedanta Math.

He formed the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society in [[Kolkata]] in 1923, which is now known as Ramakrishna Vedanta Math. In 1924, he established Ramakrishna Vedanta Math in [[Darjeeling]] in [[Bengal Presidency]] (now [[West Bengal]]). In 1927, he started publishing ''Visvavani'', the monthly magazine of the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society, which he edited from 1927 to 1938,&lt;ref name=bangla&gt;{{cite book |last=Bhowmik |first=Dulal |year=2012 |chapter=Abhedananda, Swami |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Abhedananda,_Swami |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which is still published today. In 1936, he presided over the Parliament of Religions at the Town Hall, Calcutta, as a part the birth centenary celebrations of Ramakrishna.&lt;ref name=belu/&gt;

He died on 8 September 1939 at Ramakrishna Vedanta Math. At the time of his death he was the last surviving direct disciple of Ramakrishna.&lt;ref name=rm&gt;[http://www.sriramakrishna.org/x-apostle-swami-abhedananda.asp?Page=S602 Swami Abhedananda Biography]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ''The [[Ramakrishna Mission]] Institute of Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Tarō Kōno'''|河野 太郎|Kōno Tarō|extra=born January 10, 1963}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[politician]] belonging to the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. He is a member of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]], and has served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] since a Cabinet re-shuffle by Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe|Shinzo Abe]] on 3 August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170804/p2a/00m/0na/024000c|title=Abe picks maverick as foreign minister in move to refresh Cabinet image|date=2017-08-04|work=Mainichi Daily News|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tarō Kōno was born on January 10, 1963, in [[Hiratsuka]], [[Odawara]], the oldest of the three children of [[Yōhei Kōno]], a former President of the Liberal Democratic Party and Speaker of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]]. He was born into a family of politicians: his father, his grandfather [[Ichirō Kōno]], and his great-uncle [[Kenzō Kōno]] (Speaker of the [[House of Councillors of Japan|House of Councillors]] between 1971 and 1977), were all active in national politics.

He attended Hanamizu Elementary School, [[Keio]] Middle School, and then Keio High School.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taro.org/profile|title=プロフィール|last=|first=|date=|website=衆議院議員 河野太郎公式サイト|language=ja-JP|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, he entered [[Keio University|Keiō University]] to study [[economics]] but quit after being told by his father he would have to do so if he wished to study in the United States.

In 1982, he went to the United States, where he attended the [[Suffield Academy]] and [[Georgetown University]], and studied comparative politics. In 1983, he worked for Senator [[Alan Cranston]] in his [[Alan Cranston#Presidential candidate|campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination]]. He also worked for Congressman [[Richard Shelby]] of Alabama for two years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also spent time at the [[Warsaw School of Economics]], [[Poland]], during which he spent a night in prison after visiting the home of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] leader, [[Lech Wałęsa]].

Kōno graduated from [[Georgetown University]] in 1985 with a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service and the following year he joined [[Fuji Xerox]]. He moved to Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific in [[Singapore]] in 1991. In 1993, he joined [[Nippon Tanshi]], a supplier of electric components for [[Toyota]], [[General Motors|GM]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]], and other companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Political career==
Kōno was first elected to the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] as a [[Liberal Democratic Party of Japan|Liberal Democratic]] member in the [[Japanese general election, 1996|October 1996 general election]], at age 33. He won a closely contested election in the newly created Kanagawa 15th district covering the cities of [[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa|Hiratsuka]] and [[Chigasaki, Kanagawa|Chigasaki]], adjacent to his father's constituency in the Kanagawa 17th district ([[Odawara]] and [[Hadano, Kanagawa|Hadano]]). He has since been re-elected six times, in [[Japanese general election, 2000|2000]], [[Japanese general election, 2003|2003]], [[Japanese general election, 2005|2005]], [[Japanese general election, 2009|2009]], [[Japanese general election, 2012|2012]] and [[Japanese general election, 2014|2014]]. His winning majority increased from 13,297 in 1996 to 63,058 in 2000, 71,968 in 2003, and 103,280 in 2005. The total number of votes he received in 2005 was 186,770, the second largest number in Japan's electoral history (second only to then Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi|Koizumi's]] total in the same election).

Kōno has been a member of five standing committees of the House of Representatives: Economy; Environment; Health, Labour, &amp; Welfare; Trade &amp; Industry; and Finance. In addition, he has been a member of two special committees: Consumer Affairs, and Children &amp; Youth Affairs.

In 2000, during his first term in the House, Kono approached [[Shinzō Abe|Shinzo Abe]], then in his second term, and offered to back Abe in a future LDP leadership run due to Abe's views on collective self-defense, which was then an unpopular notion in the Diet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japan-forward.com/taro-kono-as-foreign-minister-is-he-abes-trump-card-to-have-the-kono-statement-on-comfort-women-revised/|title=Taro Kono as Foreign Minister: Is He Abe's Trump Card to Have the 'Kono Statement' on Comfort Women Revised?|last=|first=|date=2017-08-07|work=Japan Forward|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Koizumi government ==
[[File:Taro Kono.jpg|thumb|200px|Kōno making a speech (July 1, 2010)]]From January to October 2002, Kōno was Parliamentary Secretary for Public Management, responsible for administrative reforms, local governments, and "e-government." From November 2005 to September 2006 he was Senior Vice Minister of Justice in Koizumi's government.

In October 2002, Kōno was named Director of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives. He resigned from this position two months later in protest over the [[Iraq War]], accusing Foreign Minister [[Yoriko Kawaguchi|Kawaguchi]] of not adequately explained the government's policy.

Kōno was the Acting Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party Committee until November 2003 and was one of the few members of the LDP to oppose the dispatch of the [[Self Defense Forces]] to Iraq.

In 2004, Kōno, then 41, was appointed Assistant Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, and was also elected Prefectural Chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party in Kanagawa Prefecture. He was the youngest Prefectural Chairman in the LDP. In 2005, he led the Party in Kanagawa in the general election.

In 2004, Kōno co-sponsored the Economic Sanction Amendment to the Foreign Exchange Law, which gives the government power to unilaterally declare economic sanctions on any state; and the Port Closure Bill, which allows the government to refuse the entry of foreign ships from Japanese ports. His website states that "[[North Korea]] was the target." He also sponsored a United Nations Reform Bill that would have required the government to reduce its voluntary contributions to the UN Systems by 10 percent each year until changes were made in the membership of the Security Council.

Kono resigned as head of the Kanagawa LDP following the [[Japanese unified local elections, 2007|2007 local elections]], in which the LDP-supported candidate Tadashi Sugino lost to incumbent [[Shigefumi Matsuzawa]]. He became head of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee in September 2008. He ran for President of the LDP in 2009, but was defeated by [[Sadakazu Tanigaki]].&lt;ref&gt;http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090920a1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Kono replaced [[Hiroyuki Sonoda]] as Deputy Secretary-General of the LDP in April 2010, after Sonoda left the party to join the [[Sunrise Party|Sunrise Party of Japan]].

In October 2015, Kono joined the [[Third Abe Cabinet]] as Chairman of the [[National Public Safety Commission (Japan)|National Public Safety Commission]], Minister in charge of Administrative Reform, Minister in charge of Civil Service Reform, Minister of State for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety, Minister of State for Regulatory Reform and Minister of State for Disaster Management. In this role, he was responsible for coordinating security measures for the [[42nd G7 summit|2016 G7 summit]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-politics-kono/a-maverick-at-home-japans-taro-kono-set-for-softer-diplomatic-approach-abroad-idUSKBN1AJ0DU|title=A maverick at home, Japan's Taro Kono set for softer diplomatic approach abroad|last=|first=|date=2017-08-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the cabinet in a reshuffle in August 2016.

In March 2017, he lashed out at Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials during a Diet committee meeting, saying: “Was the Foreign Ministry lying? Were you clueless? Did you lack motivation? Which was the case? Make yourselves clear!”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Abe named Kono Foreign Minister on 3 August 2017, replacing [[Fumio Kishida]], who had served in that role since 2012 and had rarely publicly disagreed with Abe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kono was chosen over [[Katsunobu Katō|Katsunobu Kato]], after lengthy deliberation, for his superior English ability and his grasp of international issues, despite having a reputation as an outspoken and sometimes "eccentric" politician.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Foreign media reports considered Kono to be more dovish compared to Abe, and expected him to take a softer diplomatic approach to foreign policy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201708040029.html|title=China, S. Korea media welcome new, dovish foreign minister：The Asahi Shimbun|work=The Asahi Shimbun|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many analysts were particularly optimistic that Kono would adopt his father's friendly attitude toward China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/are-china-and-japan-moving-towards-a-rapprochement/|title=Are China and Japan Moving Towards a Rapprochement?|last=Gao|first=Charlotte|date=|work=The Diplomat|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As foreign minister, Kono was responsible for coordinating Japan's response to the [[2017 North Korea crisis|North Korean crisis]]. He publicly urged countries to cut diplomatic and economic ties with North Korea following the announcement of enhanced sanctions by the US government in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-foreign-minister-taro-kono-urges-countries-to-cut-ties-with-north-korea|title=Japan Foreign Minister Taro Kono urges countries to cut ties with North Korea|last=|first=|date=2017-09-22|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kono also reportedly pressed Iranian foreign minister [[Mohammad Javad Zarif|Javad Zarif]] to increase Iranian pressure on North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-22/overheard-at-un-japan-asks-iran-for-some-help-on-north-korea|title=Overheard at UN: Japan Asks Iran for Some Help on North Korea|date=2017-09-22|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kono's father publicly criticized the government's approach to the crisis, claiming that it should be more cooperative with the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2112268/japanese-foreign-minister-taro-kono-back-foot-after-being|title=Japanese foreign minister on back foot after policy criticised by father|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the evening of the 15th of April 2018 in the flury of exchanges after the tripartite missile strikes on Syria,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yjc.ir/en/news/21748/tripartite-us-led-missile-attack-on-syria-clear-act-of-aggression-assad&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Minister Kono received the first official visit from the Chinese counterpart since November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/28/c_136931445.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will be visited for several days in the leadup to Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe`s visit to President Trump that month. Kono was the first Japanese FM to host an official Chinese FM visit for nearly a decade.

Kono's past business, as well as political ties to the United States, make him very appealing to serve as Foreign Minister. Abe said of Kono appointment, “He has been to the United States many times and made friends there. He has also had exchanges with American politicians. I'm sure he'll serve (as minister) with an understanding of how to strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance”.&lt;ref&gt;“Abe Picks Maverick as Foreign Minister in Move to Refresh Cabinet Image.” The Mainichi, 4 Aug. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Abe has made it explicitly clear that by appointing Kono to the position of Foreign Minister, he was trying to strengthen the already formidable Japanese American alliance. Kono’s appointment to Foreign Minister has also been well received by Japan’s surrounding neighbors,” Some Foreign Ministry officials say the appointment of Kono will be viewed favorably by China and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Abe made it explicitly clear that by appointing Kono to the position of Foreign Minister, he was trying to strengthen the already formidable Japanese-American alliance. Kono’s appointment to Foreign Minister has also been well received by Japan’s surrounding neighbors,” Some Foreign Ministry officials say the appointment of Kono will be viewed favorably by China and South Korea 3".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy views==
Kōno is commonly dubbed as a "maverick" and known for expressing his views on politically sensitive issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He established a House subcommittee on [[genetically modified organism]]s in 1997 and supported new labeling rules on GMOs.

He opposes the government's nuclear policy, especially plans to pursue the nuclear fuel cycle and to build new power stations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before severing as Foreign Minister, Kono was on record as saying he would, like the Japanese Government to curtail its reliance on Nuclear energy going forward.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;Sieg, Linda, and Kiyoshi Takenaka; “A Maverick at Home, Japan's Taro Kono Set for Softer Diplomatic Approach Abroad.” Reuters, Thomson Reuters, 3 Aug. 2017, www.reuters.com/article/japan-politics-kono/a-maverick-at-home-japans-taro-kono-set-for-softer-diplomatic-approach-abroad-idUSL4N1KP140.&lt;/ref&gt; He specifically opposed Government plans to build new nuclear reactors. Kono also believes Japan needs to be more prudent about the dangers of Nuclear Energy in the aftermath of the Fujiyama Nuclear Explosion by limiting the number of years already operational nuclear stations are free to operate, “Kono has said he wants Japan to commit to phasing out nuclear power by shutting down reactors when they reach 40 years of service, contrasting the government’s policy of maintaining its nuclear reactors as a core energy source”.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt; Kono believes that Nuclear explosions and contamination are not the only dangers that result from Japan’s reliance on Nuclear Energy, “ "We've been depending on the nuclear energy so much,"... "It's not the policy choice. It's because of those bureaucrats and the power company and the politician got some vested interest in promoting nuclear".&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Anthony. “Public Anger Against Nuclear Power Mounts In Japan.” NPR, NPR, 31 Mar. 2011, www.npr.org/2011/03/31/135008910/public-anger-against-nuclear-power-mounts-in-japan.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his appointment as Foreign Minister, on being on August 3, 2017, Kono has taken a partisan approach toNuclear Energy policies, “ Asked at his inaugural news conference Wednesday night whether he will retain his criticism of Abe’s nuclear policy, Kono said he was “going in the same direction” as his boss"&lt;ref&gt;“New Minister Kono Now 'Going in Same Direction' as Abe on Nuclear Policy.” The Japan Times, www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/08/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-nuclear-policy-critic-kono-newly-appointed-minister-now-going-direction-boss/.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has said that he would not visit [[Yasukuni Shrine|Yasakuni]] shrine if he was ever made Prime Minister, although he visits the shrine at present because he has relatives who died in the war. [http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=189925&amp;rel_no=1] Kono believes that the best way for Japan to limit political backlash from their surrounding neighbors is to build a new shrine, “Kono said he supported building a new national memorial to honor the war dead, saying it would make it easier for the Emperor and the prime minister to pay their respects”.&lt;ref&gt;“Presidential Candidates Call for LDP Makeover.” The Japan Times, www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/09/20/news/presidential-candidates-call-for-ldp-makeover/.&lt;/ref&gt; Kono believes that building a new shrine will de-escalate tension from Japan’s neighbors over Japan’s prime minister visiting the current shrine, which honors 14 Class-A-War criminals. The Japanese Emperor does not currently visit Yasukuni Shrine.

He supports amendment of [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]] of the [[Japanese Constitution]], allowing the Self-Defense Forces to engage in warfare. He supports the [[Japan-U.S. Security Treaty]], but seeks revision of the [[Status of Forces Agreement]] (SOFA)&lt;ref name="ipsnewsasia.net"&gt;[http://www.ipsnewsasia.net/bridgesfromasia/node/33 JAPAN: Politician Reflects Tokyo's Ambivalence in Foreign Affairs | IPS Asia-Pacific News: Bridges from Asia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011115413/http://www.ipsnewsasia.net/bridgesfromasia/node/33 |date=2008-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the issue of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] Air Station in the [[Okinawa]]n city of [[Futenma]], Kono's "off the record" views "conflict with the official Japanese position."&lt;ref name="ipsnewsasia.net" /&gt; He opposes donation of development aid to any countries that have failed to ratify the Complete Test Ban Treaty.

He has supported raising the consumption tax rate to 8 percent, with the funds to be directed towards the National Pension.

Kōno advocates for more immigration, having criticized the government's resistance to opening the door to immigrants in order to mitigate Japan's labor shortage as a result of its aging and shrinking population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/08/03/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-poised-reshuffle-cabinet-support-slides-tap-kono-top-envoy/|title=Abe looks for rebound with make-or-break Cabinet reshuffle|last=Osaki|first=Tomohiro|date=2017-08-03|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taro Kono is considered to be an Asia-Centrist despite his strong ties to the United States. Taro Kono has long been an emphatic proponent of a reinvigorating the Korea and Japan alliance, “ We need an Asia-Centric policy that considers at the same time Japan's national interests and the interests of surrounding nations, and the focus of that is between Japan and Korea”.&lt;ref name="Lawmaker Urges Asia-Centric Vision 2004"&gt;Japanese Lawmaker Urges Asia-Centric Vision, Stronger Ties to Korea - OhmyNews International, 2 Oct. 2004, english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=189925&amp;rel_no=1.&lt;/ref&gt; The fixation on Asia-Centrism by Kono is a direct dichotomy from most LDP politicians, who heavily stress Japan’s relationship with America. Kono would like to entwine a greater business and economic relationship between the two nations. Kono is on record as saying, “I understand the problem as one in which Korea and Japan must pool their strength so that they might survive in the changing global environment”.&lt;ref&gt;. Japanese Lawmaker Urges Asia-Centric Vision, Stronger Ties to Korea - OhmyNews International, 2 Oct. 2004, english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=189925&amp;rel_no=1.&lt;/ref&gt; Kono believes that Japan and Korea must stick together in order to compete with the current economic superpowers of the world like the United States and China. Kono has taken several steps to forging a more vigorous relationship between Japan and Korea. Kono Co-Sponsored a bill which now allows direct air service between Gimpo, South Korea and Haneda airport in Tokyo Japan.&lt;ref name="Lawmaker Urges Asia-Centric Vision 2004"/&gt; Kono hopes that the direct flight between the two popular cities will make for easier travel by businessmen voyaging between the nations. Kono hopes that the less restrictive travel process will give rise to increased commerce between the two nations. Kono, however, still believes there is much more work to be done to help generate more commerce between the two nations. Kono would like to see the extension of short terms visas up to three months from Korean nationals doing business in Japan. He is the only Japanese lawmaker who runs a Korean webpage, and provides internships to Korean nationals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=189925&amp;rel_no=1 Japanese Lawmaker Urges Asia-centric Vision, Stronger Ties to Korea - OhmyNews International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of his Korean interns went on to become the Consul-General of South Korea in Kobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |language=ja |url=http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/news/World/Asia/hangryu/series/c/4.html |script-title=ja:隣国の肖像＜４＞脱「ロビー」　冷戦後の政治交流は|last=|first=|date=2005-01-23|website=The Nishinippon Shimbun|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123045400/http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/news/World/Asia/hangryu/series/c/4.html|archive-date=2008-01-23|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kono has neither endorsed nor rejected his father's famous [[Kono Statement]], which acknowledged the Japanese military's use of [[comfort women]] during World War II.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Kōno is married to Kaori, a returnee from [[Australia]], and has a son, Ippei, born in 2002. The couple enjoy [[scuba diving]] and going to the movies.

He has become involved in a number of bodies managing professional sports. He is Chairman of Shonan Bellmare, a professional football club, and of the Japan Race Horse Association, which organizes Japan's largest yearling sales. He is also President of the [[Kanagawa]] Triathlon Union, the  Kanagawa Track and Field Association, and the [[Hiratsuka]] [[Baseball]] Association. He teaches a graduate class at [[Hosei University]].

In 2002, when Yōhei Kōno fell ill from a 30-year-old hepatitis C infection, Tarō Kōno offered a part of his liver for donation. This led to a public argument, as his father refused the offer. Eventually his father accepted, and in April 2002, Tarō Kōno donated part of his liver in a 15-hour operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C00E6D81F3FF936A15755C0A9649C8B63|title=Japanese Father and Son Share a Liver and a Political Rivalry|last=French|first=Howard W.|date=June 25, 2002|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kōno has since supported changes to the law regarding [[organ donation]].

== Electoral History ==
Taro Kono was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1996 representing Kanagawa 15th district, at the age of thirty-three years old. Kono is a very popular candidate winning Kanagawa’s 15th district seat in seven consecutive elections &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jimin.jp/english/profile/members/114689.html |title=KONO Taro |publisher=Liberal Democratic Party of Japan|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 Lower House Elections, Taro Kono cruised to reelection winning 120,001 votes, which was good for 47.4 percent of the votes cast in his district &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/j/japan/ |work=Adam Carr's Election Archive |title=2000 Lower House Election Single Member Districts|last=Carr|first=Adam|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2003 Lower House Elections, Taro Kono received 125,067 votes, which accounted for 55.4 percent of the votes cast in his district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/j/japan/ |work=Adam Carr's Election Archive |title=2003 Lower House Election Single Member Districts|last=Carr|first=Adam|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005 Lower House Elections, Taro Kono won 186,770 votes, or 63.9 percent of the votes cast in his district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/j/japan/ |work=Adam Carr's Election Archive |title=Lower House Election 2005 SMD|last=Carr|first=Adam|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 Lower House Elections, Taro Kono received 163,470 votes, which was good for 53.3 percent of the votes cast in his district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/j/japan/ |work=Adam Carr's Election Archive |title=Lower House Elections 2009 SMD|last=Carr|first=Adam|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kano has fared quite well in his last two elections, winning re-election by overwhelming margins.  In 2012, Kono received 192,604 votes winning over eighty percent of the vote in his district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/j/japan/ |work=Adam Carr's Election Archive |title=Lower House Elections 2012|last=Carr|first=Adam|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an overwhelming margin of victory. In 2014, Kono did not win by quite as large of a margin. In 2014, Kono received 155,388 votes, which yielded him 68 percent of the vote in his district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/j/japan/ |work=Adam Carr's Election Archive |title=2014 Lower House Elections SMD|last=Carr|first=Adam|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kono received a large number of votes and won elections by sweeping margins.

'''Tjokorda Ngurah Wim Sukawati''', (February 1, 1923 – February 24, 2013) was the eldest son of President of the [[State of East Indonesia]] and former `King´ of [[Ubud]] [[Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati]] and his wife Gusti Agung Niang Putu. His title Tjokorda Gde indicates that Sukawati belonged to the highest [[ksatria]] (one of the four noble [[castes]] in Bali).

== Education ==

Traditionally the eldest son becomes the head of the Puri Ubud royal family, but like his father, he took a more active role in the Indonesian government. Tjokorda Wim started his education in Bali and also attended Primary School in [[Menteng]], Jakarta.

Tjokorda Wim also attended primary school in Oosterbeek, The Netherlands, when his father was heading a cultural mission in Europe (expo di Paris) in 1931. The cultural mission included a legong group from Peliatan and agriculture groups from Bali. At that time his father took three of his children to Europe, Tjokorda Wim Anak Agung Vera and Anak Agung Oka Willy.

Tjokorda Wim followed junior high school (SMP) in Malang and senior high school (SMA) in Yogyakarta. He went on to Sukabumi, West Java and graduated from the police academy, which became the start of his career.

From 1942 until 1947 Tjokorda Wim was police inspector in [[Gianyar]], [[Bali]] until his promotion to police commissioner in the capital of the republic of East Indonesia, Makassar. After serving in [[Stockholm]] and [[Paris]] Tjokorda Wim became the Indonesian Ambassador to Switzerland from 1975 to 1979.

== Family ==

It was in Makassar, that he met the Dutch woman, Nelly Luchsinger, who became his partner for life for 64 years. Nelly worked as a teacher at the OSVO in Makassar teaching cooking and nutrition. Together they had two children.

== Royal Cremation Ceremony ==

Tjokorda Ngurah Wim Sukawati died at the age of 90 on February 24, 2013,&lt;ref name="The Jakarta Post"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ubud hosts royal cremation today|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/05/14/ubud-hosts-royal-cremation-today.html|publisher=The Jakarta Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a hospital in Jakarta due to illnesses associated with old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sayoga|first=Putu|title=Ubud residents carry the deceased body from the "bade"|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/photos/tjokorda-ngurah-wim-sukawati-ubud-20130514-043148-858.html|publisher=Yahoo News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200537/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/photos/tjokorda-ngurah-wim-sukawati-ubud-20130514-043148-858.html|archivedate=2014-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated in a Balinese royal cremation in [[Ubud]]. It included a nine-tiered, 22-meter-tall bade (cremation tower), a five-meter-long naga banda (dragon) and a five-meter-tall lembu (black bull)sarcophagus. It was the biggest cremation held in Bali that year with thousands attending.

{{nihongo|'''Tsutomu Miyazaki'''|宮﨑 勤|''Miyazaki Tsutomu''|extra=August 21, 1962 – June 17, 2008}}, also known as '''The [[Otaku]] Murderer''' or '''The Little Girl Murderer''', was a Japanese [[serial killer]], [[cannibal]], and [[necrophile]] who abducted and murdered four young girls in [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] and [[Tokyo Prefecture]]s from August 1988 to June 1989. His crimes included [[vampirism]] and preservation of body parts as trophies.&lt;ref name="afp.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jNmP-nKTKmf5cYaGrRNZBaMtms2A |title=Japan executes notorious cannibal killer |publisher=AFP |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2015-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709203449/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jNmP-nKTKmf5cYaGrRNZBaMtms2A |archivedate=July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080618TDY02306.htm |title=Miyazaki unrepentant to the last / Serial child killer goes to execution without apologizing or explaining his thinking |work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |location=Tokyo |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2008-06-18 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080621044230/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080618TDY02306.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Miyazaki's premature birth left him with [[deformity|deformed]] hands, which were permanently gnarled and fused directly to the [[wrist]]s, which meant he needed to move his entire [[forearm]] in order to rotate the hand.&lt;ref name=charlest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlest.whipple.net/miyazaki.html  |title=The Silencing of the Lambs |author=Charles T. Whipple |accessdate=2008-03-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070818192957/http://www.charlest.whipple.net/miyazaki.html |archivedate = 2007-08-18}} [[Internet Archive]] copy.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his deformity, he was ostracized when he attended Itsukaichi Elementary School&lt;!-- Located where?--&gt;, and consequently kept to himself. He attended Meidai Nakano High School in [[Nakano, Tokyo]], and was a star student until his grades dropped dramatically. He was ranked 40 out of 56 in his class, and did not receive the customary admission to [[Meiji University]]. Instead of studying [[English language|English]] and becoming a teacher as he originally intended, he attended a local junior college and studied to become a photo technician.&lt;ref name=charlest/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Miyazaki moved back into his parents' house near his father's print shop, sharing a room with his elder sister. Although Miyazaki's family was highly influential in [[Itsukaichi, Tokyo|Itsukaichi]], where his father owned a newspaper, Miyazaki expressed no desire to take over his father's job. After his arrest, Miyazaki would say that what he really craved was "being listened to about his problems" but believed that his parents, more worried about the material than the sentimental—"would have not heard [him]; [he] would've been ignored". In the same confession, he said that by this period in his life he had begun to consider [[suicide]].

Miyazaki was rejected by his two younger sisters, and felt he only received support from his grandfather. In May 1988, his grandfather died. This served to deepen his [[depression (mood)|depression]] and isolated him even further. In an attempt to "retain something from him", Miyazaki ate part of his grandfather's ashes. A few weeks later, one of his sisters caught him watching her while she was taking a shower. When she told him to leave, Miyazaki attacked her. When his mother learned of the incident and demanded that he spend more time working, and less time with his videos, he attacked her as well.

==Murders==
Between August 1988 and June 1989, Miyazaki [[mutilation|mutilated]] and killed four girls between ages four and seven, and [[Child sexual abuse|sexually molested]] [[Necrophilia|their corpses]]. He drank the blood of one victim and ate a part of her hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/serial-child-killer-hanged-as-japan-steps-up-death-penalty-1-1173292 |title=Serial child-killer hanged as Japan steps up death penalty |work=[[The Scotsman]] |location=Edinburgh |date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crimes—which prior to Miyazaki's apprehension were named the "Little Girl Murders" and later the {{nihongo|Tokyo/Saitama Serial Kidnapping Murders of Little Girls|東京・埼玉連続幼女誘拐殺人事件|Tōkyō Saitama renzoku yōjo yūkai satsujin jiken}}—shocked [[Saitama Prefecture]], which had few crimes against children.

During the day, Miyazaki was, by all accounts, a mild-mannered individual. Outside of work, he randomly selected children to kill. He wrote to the families of his victims, sending them letters recalling the details of his murders. Police found that the families of the victims had something else in common: all received silent [[Nuisance call|nuisance phone calls]]. If they did not pick up the phone, it would sometimes ring for 20 minutes.

On August 22, 1988, one day after Miyazaki's 26th birthday, Mari Konno, a four-year-old girl, vanished while playing at a friend's house. After failed attempts to find her, Konno's father contacted the police. Miyazaki had led Konno into his black [[Nissan Langley]] and abducted her. He drove westward of [[Tokyo]] and parked the car under a bridge in a wooded area. There he sat alongside the girl for a half-hour before murdering her. He then [[necrophilia|engaged in sexual acts with the corpse]] and left her corpse in the hills near his home. He took her clothes with him and departed. He allowed Mari Konno's corpse to [[decompose]] for a while before later returning to remove the hands and feet, which he kept in his closet. These were recovered upon his arrest. He charred her remaining bones in his furnace, ground them into powder, and sent them to her family in a box, along with several of her teeth, photos of her clothes, and a postcard which read: "Mari. Cremated. Bones. Investigate. Prove."

On October 3, 1988, Miyazaki was driving along a rural road when he spotted seven-year-old Masami Yoshizawa. He offered her a ride, and she accepted. He then drove to the same place he had killed Konno, and killed Yoshizawa. He engaged in sexual acts with the corpse, and took the girl's clothes with him when he departed.

On December 12, 1988, four-year-old Erika Namba was returning home from a friend's house when Miyazaki kidnapped her, forcing her into his car. He drove to a parking lot in [[Naguri, Saitama]], forced her to remove her clothes in the back seat, and began to take pictures of her. After killing her, he tied her hands and feet behind her back, covered her with a bed sheet, and placed the body in his car's trunk. He disposed of the girl's clothes in a wooded area and left the body in the adjoining parking lot. Miyazaki sent a [[postcard]] to her family, assembled using words cut out of magazines: "Erika. Cold. Cough. Throat. Rest. Death."

On June 6, 1989, Miyazaki convinced five-year-old Ayako Nomoto to allow him to take pictures of her. He then led her into his car and murdered her. He covered the corpse with a bed sheet and placed her in the trunk of his car, taking the body to his apartment. He spent the next two days engaging in sexual acts with the corpse, taking pictures of it in various positions, and filming it.

When the body began to decompose, Miyazaki dismembered it, abandoning the torso in a cemetery and the head in the nearby hills. He kept the hands, from which he drank blood and ate part of them. Fearing that the police would find the corpse, he returned to the cemetery and the hills two weeks later and carried the remains back to his apartment, where he hid them in his closet.

==Arrest==
On July 23, 1989, Miyazaki attempted to insert a [[zoom lens]] into the [[vagina]] of a schoolgirl in a park near her home and was confronted by the girl's father. After fleeing naked on foot, Miyazaki eventually returned to the park to retrieve his Toyota car, whereupon he was arrested by police who had responded to a call by the father. A search of Miyazaki's two-room bungalow produced 5,763 videotapes, some containing [[anime]] and [[Slasher film|slasher]] films (later used as reasoning for his crimes). Interspersed among them was video footage and pictures of his victims. He was also reported to be a fan of [[horror film]]s of which he had a collection. Miyazaki, who retained a perpetually calm and collected demeanor during his trial, appeared indifferent to his capture.

The [[News media|media]] called him "The [[Otaku]] Murderer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scaredyet.net/the-otaku-killer-miyazaki-tsutomu/ |title=The Otaku Killer: Miyazaki Tsutomu |last=Oliviera |first=James |date=2010-01-03 |accessdate=2015-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His killings caused a [[moral panic]] against [[otaku]], accusing anime and horror films of making him a murderer. These reports were disputed.  In [[Eiji Ōtsuka]]'s book on the crime, he argued that Miyazaki's collection of pornography was probably added or amended by a photographer in order to highlight his perversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.odn.ne.jp/kamiya-ta/gisi.html|script-title=ja:大塚英志『「おたく」の精神史』|language=Japanese|author=Kousetsu Kamiya|accessdate=2008-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic, Fumiya Ichihashi, suspected the released information was playing up to public stereotypes and fears about otaku, as the police knew they would help cement a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunfield.ne.jp/~mike/books/nonfiction/crime/author/ichihashi_fumiya/miyazaki.htm|title=Miyazaki Tsutomu Jiken|publisher=Japanese Literature Webring|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyazaki's father refused to pay for his son's legal defense and committed [[suicide in Japan|suicide]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="afp.google.com" /&gt;

==Trial and execution==
The trial began on March 30, 1990. Often talking nonsensically, Miyazaki blamed his actions on "Rat Man", an [[alter ego]] who Miyazaki claimed forced him to kill; he spent time during the trial drawing "Rat Man" in cartoon form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4156285.ece |title=Japanese 'cannibal killer' executed in Tokyo |work=[[The Times]] |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-17 |location=London |first=Leo |last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tokyo District Court]] judged him still aware of the magnitude and consequences of his crimes and therefore accountable. He was sentenced to death on April 14, 1997.

==Early life==
Valery Yakovlevich Leontiev was born on [[19 March]] [[1949]], in Ust-Usa, a village in what is now Russia's [[Komi Republic]]. His father Yakov Stepanovich Leontiev was a [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]], a specialist in deer, and his mother Catherine Ivanovna Leontieva took care of the children: Valery and his sister. At six, Valery recited poems to herders from an improvised stage. As a first-grader, he began singing in the school choir. Valery participated in school plays and took up piano lessons.

In 1961 the family moved to the city [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]] in [[Ivanovo Oblast]], and after graduation, Leontiev went to conquer [[Moscow]] and to act in [[Russian Academy of Theatre Arts]]. However, panic and fear to fail in the exam made Leontiev at the last moment to take the documents and return to Yuryevets. Here the future artist has changed many professions - from the postman to the designer, but in the end went in [[Vorkuta]] and entered the Mining Institute. However, to learn unloved case Leontiev was able only to third year. 

==Musical career==
The first exit to the big stage took place in 1971. In [[Vorkuta]] regional competition "Song-71" was held. There, Leontiev took second place with the song "Carnaval". And the first concert the singer gave was on April 9, 1972 on the stage of Vorkuta's [[:ru:Дворец культуры шахтёров (Воркута)|House of Culture of Miners and Builders]]. From this moment begins the career of Leontiev as a singer.

In 1972, Leontiev went to [[Syktyvkar]] for a festival competition among amateur creative youth "We are looking for talents" and wins it. after which Leontiev was sent to study at the all-Union creative Studio pop art, was in [[Moscow]]. However, study here has not been completed. A year later, the director of the Syktyvkar Philharmonic took the group, which included Leontiev, back to Syktyvkar. In Syktyvkar Leontiev worked as a soloist in the ensemble of "Dreamers", and in 1975 became the soloist of the ensemble "Echo" with which he traveled all over the [[Soviet Union]]. However, the concerts were mostly held in the provincial houses of culture.

Climbing on the big stage began for the singer later - after the transition to the Gorky Philharmonic and receiving first Prize at the All-Union competition for the best performance of songs of the socialist countries in 1979. Less than a year later, Leontiev already gave a full-fledged solo concert in [[:ru:Московский театр эстрады|Moscow Variety Theatre]], and for the performance of compositions by [[David Tukhmanov]] "Dance time in the sun" he received First prize of the International Festival "[[Golden Orpheus]]".

In 1980 Leontiev sang in various concerts, including the [[:ru:Московский театр эстрады|Moscow Variety Theatre]], [[Oktyabrskiy Big Concert Hall|Oktyabrsky]] and [[Luzhniki Palace of Sports|Luzhniki]]. In 1981, the artist won the popularity prize at the prestigious music festival [[:ru:Ереван-81|Yerevan-81]]. American journalists who attended the event noted the expressive manner of performing the singer and compared him to Mick Jagger. (''Valeri Leontiev, 32, a booted, bolero-suited dancing rocker whose performance falls somewhere between those of [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]'')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vl-club.ru/press_text.php?filename=pressa/time.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; However, this fact caused opposition to the leaders of the Soviet stage and officials, therefore, until 1984, Leontiev fell into disgrace. Overcomes her artist with the help of one of the influential composers of those years - [[Raimond Pauls]].

In 1982, Leontiev underwent a serious operation to remove a tumor from his throat, and on his further career of the singer hung a huge question mark. In this difficult time Leontiev decided to engage seriously in education and entered the [[Saint-Petersburg State University of Culture and Arts]]. Fortunately, in 1983, the singer was able to return to the stage, the artist gives 18 sold-out concerts entitled "I'm just a singer" in [[Saint-Petersburg|Leningrad]]. however, a busy schedule of concerts did not prevent him from finishing his studies and qualify as "mass" view.

In 1983, the singer moves to work in the Voroshilovgrad Philharmonic (now [[:ru:Луганская областная филармония|Luhansk Philharmonic]]) in the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. A year later, he was given a whole department in the author's evening "Holy to music love" by composer [[Raimond Pauls]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e59G_WVxxHA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Leontiev received the [[Lenin Komsomol Prize]]. And after that he went to [[Afghanistan]] together with a group of artists. 1986 was marked by a trip to [[Chernobyl]], where the singer performed. And in 1987 Leontiev already became [[Merited Artist of Ukraine|Merited Artist of Ukrainian SSR]].

The beginning of the 90s was marked for Leontiev splash touring. His concerts were held in Germany, Israel, USA, Canada, India and other countries. In 1991 Leontiev was named the "Best Selling Soviet Artist" at the [[World Music Awards]] ceremony in [[Monte Carlo]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBeMkExaOnw&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1994 he performed on stage with [[Gina Lollobrigida]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cdDkgGyfjQ&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Saint-Petersburg]] concert hall "[[Oktyabrskiy Big Concert Hall|Oktyabrskiy]]", and in 1996 he was awarded the title [[ People's Artist of Russia]]. in March 1998 а nominal star of Valery Leontiev was opened on the [[Star Square (Moscow)|Star Square]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM1RolACaOw&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 Leontiev was  awarded the "Living Legend Award" at the Russian national music award "[[Ovation (award)|Ovation]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG5YSkPF9qc&lt;/ref&gt;

Valery Leontiev is married to [[Bassist|bass guitarist]] Lyudmila Isakovich&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdpMr-IuF2s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr_vBk50XrY&lt;/ref&gt;. Couple together since 1972. However, officially relations were registered only in 1998. The artist's wife lives in [[Miami]].

==Eurovision Song Contest 1987==
The [[Soviet Union]] never participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], but it made several attempts in the late 1980s. In 2009 Eduard Fomin, a former employee of the [[Ministry of Education (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Education]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]], revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, the Minister of Education for the Soviet Union, brought forward the idea of Soviet participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due to the number of political reforms made by the [[President of the Soviet Union]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the late 1980s. The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest for the Soviet Union would impact on the relationships between the Soviet Union and the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] countries of the [[First World|west]]. Valery Leontiev was suggested as a singer for the Soviet Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so the Soviet Union never entered the contest before dissolving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nnm.ru/blogs/korova2007/neveroyatno_leontev_dolzhen_byl_predstavlyat_sssr_na_evrovidenie-87_2/|script-title=ru:Невероятно!

'''William Henry Davies''' or '''W. H. Davies''' (3 July 1871&lt;ref&gt;Although a number of secondary sources give a birth on 20 April 1871, a date in which Davies himself fully believed all his life, his birth certificate gives 3 July 1871.&lt;/ref&gt; – 26 September 1940) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] poet and writer. Davies spent a significant part of his life as a [[tramp]] or [[hobo]], in the United Kingdom and United States, but became one of the most popular poets of his time. The principal themes in his work are observations about life's hardships, the ways in which the human condition is reflected in nature, his own tramping adventures and the various characters he met. Davies is usually classed as one of the [[Georgian Poetry|Georgian Poets]], although much of his work is not typical of the group, in either style or theme.&lt;ref name=Normand&gt;Normand, L. (2003), ''W. H. Davies'', Bridgend: Poetry Wales Press Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
=== Early life===
[[File:Davies plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque commemorating Davies' supposed place of birth, at "The Church House Inn", in [[Pillgwenlly]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Wales.]] 
The son of an [[iron moulder]], Davies was born at 6, Portland Street in the [[Pillgwenlly]] district of [[Newport, Monmouthshire|Newport]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], a busy port. He had an older brother, Francis Gomer Boase (who was considered "slow") and in 1874 his younger sister Matilda was born.

In November 1874, when William was aged three, his father died. The following year his mother Mary Anne Davies remarried and became Mrs Joseph Hill. She agreed that care of the three children should pass to their paternal grandparents, Francis and Lydia Davies, who ran the nearby Church House Inn at 14, Portland Street. His grandfather Francis Boase Davies, originally from [[Cornwall]], had been a sea captain. Davies was related to the famous British actor [[Sir Henry Irving]] (referred to as cousin Brodribb by the family); he later recalled that his grandmother referred to Irving as " the cousin who brought disgrace on us". Davies' grandmother was described, by a neighbour who remembered her, as wearing ".. pretty little caps, with bebe ribbon, tiny roses and puce trimmings".&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Hando|F. J. Hando]], ''The Pleasant Land of Gwent'', 1944, R. H. Johns, Newport.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in his Introduction to the 1943 ''Collected Poems of W. H. Davies'', [[Osbert Sitwell]] recalled Davies telling him that, in addition to his grandparents and himself, his home consisted of "an imbecile brother, a sister&amp;nbsp;... a maidservant, a dog, a cat, a parrot, a dove and a canary bird." Sitwell also recounts that Davies' grandmother, a [[Baptist]] by denomination, was "of a more austere and religious turn of mind than her husband."&lt;ref name=Sitwell&gt;''Collected Poems of W. H. Davies'', London: Jonathan Cape (Third Impression 1943), pp. xxi–xxviii, "Introduction" by [[Osbert Sitwell]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879 the family moved to Raglan Street, then later to Upper Lewis Street, from where William attended Temple School. In 1883 he moved to Alexandra Road School and the following year was arrested, as one of a gang of five schoolmates, and charged with stealing handbags. He was given twelve strokes of the [[Birching|birch]]. In 1885 Davies wrote his first poem entitled "Death".

In his ''Poet's Pilgrimage'' (1918) Davies recounts the time when, at the age of 14, he was left with orders to sit with his dying grandfather. He missed the final moments of his grandfather's death as he was too engrossed in reading "a very interesting book of wild adventure".&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. H. (1918), ''A Poet's Pilgrimage'', London: Melrose, pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Delinquent to "supertramp" ===
Having finished school under the cloud of his theft he worked first for an [[ironmonger]]. In November 1886, his grandmother signed the papers for Davies to begin a five-year apprenticeship to a local picture-frame maker. Davies never enjoyed the craft, however, and never settled into any regular work. He was a difficult and somewhat delinquent young man, and made repeated requests to his grandmother to lend him the money to sail to America. When these were all refused, he eventually left Newport, took casual work and started to travel. ''[[The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp]]'', published in 1908, covers his life in the USA between 1893 and 1899, including many adventures and characters from his travels as a drifter. During this period he crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] at least seven times, working on cattle ships. He travelled through many of the states, sometimes begging, sometimes taking seasonal work, but often ending up spending any savings on a drinking spree with a fellow traveller.

He took advantage of the corrupt system of "[[boodle]]", to pass the winter in [[Michigan]], by agreeing to be locked up in a series of different jails. Here, with his fellow tramps, Davies would enjoy the relative comfort of "card-playing, singing, smoking, reading, relating experiences and occasionally taking exercise or going out for a walk."&lt;ref&gt;Hockey, L. (1971), ''W. H. Davies'', [[University of Wales Press]] (on behalf of the [[Welsh Arts Council]]), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; At one stage, on his way to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], he lay alone in a swamp for three days and nights suffering from [[malaria]].&lt;ref name=Normand/&gt;
 
The turning point in Davies' life came when, after a week of rambling in London, he spotted a newspaper story about the riches to be made in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]] and immediately set off to make his fortune in Canada. Attempting to jump a freight train at [[Renfrew, Ontario]], on 20 March 1899, with fellow tramp Three-fingered Jack, he lost his footing and his right foot was crushed under the wheels of the train. The leg later had to be amputated below the knee and he wore a wooden leg thereafter. Davies' biographers have agreed that the significance of the accident should not be underestimated, even though Davies himself played down the story. Moult begins his biography with the incident&lt;ref name=Moult&gt;Moult, T. (1934), ''W. H. Davies'', London: Thornton Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard J. Stonesifer|Stonesifer]] has suggested that this event, more than any other, led Davies to become a professional poet.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;[[Richard J. Stonesifer|Stonesifer, R. J.]] (1963), ''W. H. Davies – A Critical Biography'', London: Jonathan Cape, ISBN B0000CLPA3 (first full biography of Davies).&lt;/ref&gt; Davies himself wrote of the accident: "I bore this accident with an outward fortitude that was far from the true state of my feelings. Thinking of my present helplessness caused me many a bitter moment, but I managed to impress all comers with a false indifference&amp;nbsp;... I was soon home again, having been away less than four months; but all the wildness had been taken out of me, and my adventures after this were not of my own seeking, but the result of circumstances." &lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. H. (1908), ''The Autobiography of a Super Tramp'', London: Fifield, Chapter XX: "Hospitality".&lt;/ref&gt; Davies' view of his own disability was ambivalent. In his poem "The Fog", published in the 1913 ''Foliage'',&lt;ref name=Foliage&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/foliage09323gut/folge10.txt [[Project Gutenberg]] full text of "Foliage"]&lt;/ref&gt; a blind man leads the poet through the fog, showing the reader that one who is handicapped in one domain may well have a considerable advantage in another.

'''[[Leisure (poem)|Leisure]]'''

What is this life if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.

No time to stand beneath the boughs
And stare as long as sheep or cows.

No time to see, when woods we pass,
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.

No time to see, in broad day light,
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.

No time to turn at beauty's glance,
And watch her feet, how they can dance.

No time to wait till her mouth can
Enrich that smile her eyes began.

A poor life this if, full of care,
We have no time to stand and stare.
   
&lt;/poem&gt;

He returned to Britain, living a rough life, particularly in London shelters and [[doss-house]]s, including the [[Salvation Army]] hostel in [[Southwark]] known as "The Ark"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki_ihc.nsf/vw-sublinks/7CAC02A4A3A57CC880257451004D619E?openDocument |title=The Salvation Army London City Colony: Statistics |publisher=.salvationarmy.org.uk |accessdate=18 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223225548/http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/uki/www_uki_ihc.nsf/vw-sublinks/7CAC02A4A3A57CC880257451004D619E?openDocument |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which he grew to despise. Fearing the contempt of his fellow tramps, he would often feign slumber in the corner of his doss-house, mentally composing his poems and only later committing them to paper in private. At one stage he borrowed money to have his poems printed on loose sheets of paper, which he then tried to sell door-to-door through the streets of residential London. When this enterprise failed, he returned to his lodgings and, in a fit of rage, burned all of the printed sheets in the fire.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

Davies self-published his first book of poetry, ''The Soul's Destroyer'', in 1905, again by means of his own savings. It proved to be the beginning of success and a growing reputation. To even get the slim volume published, Davies had to forgo his allowance and live the life of a tramp for six months (with the first draft of the book hidden in his pocket), just to secure a loan of funds from his inheritance. When eventually published, the volume was largely ignored and he resorted to posting individual copies by hand to prospective wealthy customers chosen from the pages of ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'', asking them to send the price of the book, a [[Half crown (British coin)|half crown]], in return. He eventually managed to sell 60 of the 200 copies printed.&lt;ref name=Normand/&gt; One of the copies was sent to [[Arthur St. John Adcock|Arthur Adcock]], then a journalist with the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. On reading the book, as he later wrote in his essay "Gods of Modern Grub Street", Adcock said that he "recognised that there were crudities and even doggerel in it, there was also in it some of the freshest and most magical poetry to be found in modern books".&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt; He sent the price of the book and asked Davies to meet him. Adcock is still generally regarded as "the man who discovered Davies".&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt; The first trade edition of ''The Soul's Destroyer'' was published by Alston Rivers in 1907. A second edition followed in 1908 and a third in 1910. A 1906 edition, by Fifield, was advertised but has not been verified.&lt;ref&gt;(Harlow, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural life in Kent===
On 12 October 1905 Davies met [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], then literary critic for the ''[[Daily Chronicle (United Kingdom)|Daily Chronicle]]'' in London, who was to do more to help him than anyone else.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; Thomas rented for Davies the tiny two-roomed "Stidulph's Cottage", in Egg Pie Lane, not far from his own home at Elses Farm near [[Sevenoaks]] in Kent. Davies moved to the cottage, from 6 Llanwern Street, Newport, via London, in the second week of February 1907.  The cottage was "only two meadows off" from Thomas' own house.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. H. (1914), ''Nature'', London: [[Anova Books|Batsford]], Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas adopted the role of protective guardian for Davies, on one occasion even arranging for the manufacture, by a local [[wheelwright]], of a makeshift replacement wooden leg, which was invoiced to Davies as "a novelty cricket bat".

In 1907, the manuscript of ''[[The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp]]'' drew the attention of [[George Bernard Shaw]], who agreed to write a preface (largely through the concerted efforts of his wife Charlotte). It was only because of Shaw that Davies' contract with the publishers was rewritten to allow the author to retain the serial rights, all rights after three years, royalties of fifteen per cent of selling price and a non-returnable advance of twenty five pounds. Davies was also to be given a say on the style of all illustrations, advertisement layouts and cover designs. The original publisher, [[Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd|Duckworth and Sons]], refused to accept these demands and so the book was placed instead with London publisher Fifield.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

A number of anecdotes of Davies' time with the Thomas family in Kent are recounted in the brief account later published by Thomas' widow Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Helen. (1973), ''A Memory of W. H. Davies'', Edinburgh, Tragara Press, {{ISBN|0-902616-09-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Davies was awarded a [[Civil List]] Pension of £50,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/07/07/104827997.pdf |title="PENSION FOR TRAMP POET: W.H.Davies to Have 50 a Year - Conrad and Yeats Also Aided" at nytimes.com |work=The New York Times |date=7 July 1911 |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; later increased to £100 and then again to £150.

Davies started to spend more time in London and made many literary friends and acquaintances. Though averse to giving [[autograph]]s himself, Davies began to make a collection of his own and was particularly keen to obtain that of [[D. H. Lawrence]].
 
Georgian poetry publisher [[Edward Marsh (polymath)|Edward Marsh]] was able to secure an autograph and also invited Lawrence and wife-to-be [[Frieda von Richthofen|Frieda]] to meet Davies on 28 July 1913. Lawrence was immediately captivated by Davies and later invited him to join them in Germany. Despite his early enthusiasm for Davies' work, however, Lawrence's opinion changed after reading ''Foliage'' and he commented after reading ''Nature Poems'' in Italy that the verses seemed "so thin, one can hardly feel them".&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

By this time Davies had amassed a library of about fifty books in his cottage, mostly of 16th- and 17th-century poets, and including [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]], [[Wordsworth]], [[Byron]], [[Robert Burns|Burns]], [[Shelley]], [[Keats]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[William Blake|Blake]] and [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Herrick]]. In December 1908 his essay "How It Feels To Be Out of Work", described by Stonesifer as "a rather pedestrian performance", appeared in the pages of ''[[The English Review]]''. He continued to send other periodical articles out to editors, but without any success.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

===Society life in London===
After lodging at a number of temporary addresses in Sevenoaks, Davies moved back to London early in 1914, settling eventually at 14 [[Great Russell Street]] in the [[Bloomsbury]] district, previously the residence of [[Charles Dickens]]. Here in a tiny two-room apartment, initially infested with mice and rats, and next door to rooms occupied by a noisy Belgian prostitute, he lived from early 1916 until 1921. It was during this time in London that Davies embarked on a series of public readings of his work, alongside such others as [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[W. B. Yeats]], impressing fellow poet [[Ezra Pound]]. He soon found that he was able to socialise with leading society figures of the day, including [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]] and [[Lady Randolph Churchill]]. While in London Davies also became friendly with a number of artists, including [[Jacob Epstein]], Harold and [[Laura Knight]], [[Nina Hamnett]], [[Augustus John]], [[Harold Gilman]], [[William Rothenstein]], [[Walter Sickert]], Sir [[William Nicholson (artist)|William Nicholson]] and [[Osbert Sitwell|Osbert]] and [[Edith Sitwell]]. He enjoyed the society of literary men and their conversation, particularly in the rarefied atmosphere downstairs at the [[Café Royal]]. He would also meet regularly with [[William Henry Hudson|W. H. Hudson]], [[Edward Garrett]] and others at The Mont Blanc in [[Soho]].&lt;ref name=waters/&gt;
 
In his poetry Davies drew extensively for material on his experiences with the seamier side of life, but also on his love of nature. By the time of his prominent place in the Edward Marsh ''[[Georgian Poetry]]'' series, he was an established figure. He is generally best known for the opening two lines of the poem "[[Leisure (poem)|Leisure]]", first published in ''Songs of Joy and Others'' in 1911: "What is this life if, full of care / We have no time to stand and stare&amp;nbsp;..."

In October 1917 his work was included in the anthology ''Welsh Poets: A Representative English selection from Contemporary Writers'' collated by A. G. Prys-Jones and published by Erskine Macdonald of London.

In the last months of 1921, Davies moved to more comfortable quarters at 13 Avery Row, [[Brook Street]], where he rented rooms from the [[Society of Friends|Quaker]] poet Olaf Baker. He began to find prolonged work difficult, however, suffering from increased bouts of rheumatism and other ailments. Harlow (1993) lists a total of 14 [[BBC]] broadcasts of Davies reading his own work made between 1924 and 1940 (now held in the [[Caversham Park|BBC broadcast archive]])&lt;ref&gt;Harlow, S. (1993), ''W. H. Davies – A Bibliography'', Winchester, Oak Knoll Books, St.Paul's Bibliographies. {{ISBN|1-873040-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; although none included his most famous work, "Leisure". ''Later Days'', the 1925 sequel to ''The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp'', describes the beginnings of Davies' career as a writer and his acquaintance with Belloc, Shaw and [[Walter de la Mare|de la Mare]], amongst many others.

He became "the most painted literary man of his day", drawn and painted by Augustus John, Sir William Nicholson, Dame Laura Knight and Sir William Rothenstein. His head in bronze was the most successful of Epstein's smaller works.&lt;ref name=waters/&gt;

===Marriage and later life===
[[File:Glendower 2.jpg|thumb|right|Davies' last home "Glendower", Watledge Road, [[Nailsworth]], Gloucestershire]]

On 5 February 1923, Davies married 23-year-old Helen Matilda Payne, at the Registry Office in [[East Grinstead]], Sussex, and the couple set up home in the town at "Tor Leven", Cantelupe Road. According to one of the witnesses, [[Conrad Aiken]], the ceremony proceeded with Davies "in a near panic".&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The marriage certificate gives Davies' occupation as "An Author", that of his father (sic) as "Able Seaman" and that of Helen's father as "Farmer".&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Young Emma'' was a frank and often disturbing account of his life before and after picking Helen up at a bus-stop in the [[Edgware Road]] near [[Marble Arch]]. He had caught sight of her just getting off the bus and describes her wearing a "saucy-looking little velvet cap with tassels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/24th-january-1981/14/an-amazing-document|title=An Amazing Document – from the Tablet Archive|publisher=thetablet.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919162529/http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/24th-january-1981/14/an-amazing-document|archive-date=19 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still unmarried, Helen was pregnant at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Stonesifier describes Helen as "...&amp;nbsp;a twenty-two-year-old Sussex girl, a nurse in a hospital to which he was sent for treatment&amp;nbsp;..." when Davies was very ill in the spring of 1922. While [[Veronica Wedgwood|Dame Veronica Wedgwood]], in her preface to the book, describes Helen as "...&amp;nbsp;a country girl who had come to London, become pregnant by a man whom she could not marry, was without resources and afraid to go back to her people".&lt;/ref&gt; While living with Davies in London, before the couple were married, Helen suffered a dramatic and almost fatal miscarriage. Although Davies eagerly sent the manuscript for ''Young Emma'' to [[Jonathan Cape]] in August 1924, he later changed his mind and asked for the manuscript to be returned and the copies destroyed. Only Davies' lack of direct instruction prompted Cape to secretly keep the copies in a locked safe. Later, following Davies' death, when asked by Cape for his advice, George Bernard Shaw advised against publication, and the book was eventually published only after Helen's death in 1979.&lt;ref name=Emma&gt;Davies, W. H. (1980), ''Young Emma'', Sevenoaks: Hodder and Stoughton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-340-32115-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple lived quietly and happily, moving from East Grinstead, first to Sevenoaks, then to "Malpas House", [[Oxted]] in Surrey and finally settling at a series of five different residences at [[Nailsworth]] in Gloucestershire. The first of these was the comfortable detached 19th-century stone-built house "Axpills" (later known as "Shenstone"), with a garden of some character. In the last seven years of his life he lived in four different houses, all within a mile and the first three all within three hundred yards of one another.&lt;ref name=waters/&gt; His last home was the small roadside cottage "Glendower" in the hamlet of Watledge. The couple had no children.

In 1930 he edited the poetry anthology ''Jewels of Song'' for Cape, choosing works by more than 120 different poets, and including [[William Blake]], [[Thomas Campion]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] and [[W. B. Yeats]]. Of his own poems he selected only "The Kingfisher" and "Leisure". The collection was re-published as ''An Anthology of Short Poems'' in 1938.

===Decline and death===
Davies returned to Newport, in September 1938, for the unveiling of a plaque in his honour at the Church House Inn, and with an address given by the Poet Laureate [[John Masefield]]. He was still unwell, however, and this proved to be his last public appearance.&lt;ref name=Normand/&gt;

Before his marriage to Helen, Davies would regularly visit London and stay with Osbert Sitwell and his brother [[Sacheverell Sitwell|Sacheverell]]. He particularly enjoyed walking with them along [[River Thames|the river]] from the [[Houses of Parliament]] to the [[Chelsea Physic Garden|Physic Garden]], near to their house, in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. During his visits Davies would often call, on a Sunday afternoon, to hear recitals on the [[harpsichord]] and [[clavichord]] given by [[Violet Gordon Woodhouse]]. Having moved to Watledge the Davieses continued to visit Gordon Woodhouse, at her house in [[Nether Lypiatt]], near [[Stroud]], to dine with the Sitwells.
 
About three months before he died, Davies was visited at Glendower by Gordon Woodhouse and the Sitwells, Davies being too ill to travel to dinner at Nether Lypiatt. Osbert Sitwell noted that Davies looked "very ill" but that ".. his head, so typical of him in its rustic and nautical boldness, with the black hair now greying a little, but as stiff as ever, surrounding his high bony forehead, seemed to have acquired an even more sculptural quality." Helen privately explained to Sitwell that Davies' heart showed "alarming symptoms of weakness" caused, according to his doctors, by the continuous dragging weight of his wooden leg. Helen had been careful to keep the true extent of the medical diagnosis from her husband.

Davies himself confided in Sitwell:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I've never been ill before, really, except when I had that accident and lost my leg&amp;nbsp;... And, d'you know, I grow so irritable when I've got that pain, I can't bear the sound of people's voices.&amp;nbsp;... Sometimes I feel I should like to turn over on my side and die.&lt;ref name=Sitwell/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davies' health continued to deteriorate and he died, in September 1940, at the age of 69. Never a church-goer in his adult life, Davies was cremated at [[Cheltenham]] and his remains interred there.

===Glendower===
From 1949, "Glendower" was the home of the poet's great nephew Norman Phillips. In 2003, Phillips suffered a heart attack and was forced to move into council accommodation. He subsequently spent £34,000 on the house hoping to move back, but faced a further five figure sum for essential maintenance. Local residents, including Anthony Burton and biographer Barbara Hooper, formed "The Friends of Glendower" to help save the property and promote the poet's work. [[Stroud District Council]], however, had already voted to embark on the process of obtaining a [[Compulsory Purchase Order]]. In 2010, "The Friends of Glendower" arranged a series of lectures, exhibitions, walks and other events, in Nailsworth and Stroud, between 13 and 26 September to mark the 70th anniversary of the poet's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8957000/8957266.stm |title=Campaign to save last home of poet WH Davies at bbc.co.uk |publisher=BBC News |date=1 September 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=This is Gloucestershire |url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/news/news/Poetry-plan-historic-home/article-1417567-detail/article.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919171533/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/news/news/Poetry-plan-historic-home/article-1417567-detail/article.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2012 |title=Poetry plan for historic Stroud home |publisher=Gloucester Citizen |date=14 October 2009 |accessdate=8 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012 a number of Davies' books, signed by the author, were found during a restoration of the cottage which had been instigated by the Friends of Glendower. The first phase of restoration was due to be completed in 2013, making part of the house habitable once more. Five signed books were found, in a wardrobe in one of the bedrooms, together with letters from Davies to family members. The Friends hoped that the books would remain in Nailsworth and that the cottage might become a Davies study-centre, using the collection of books, manuscripts and belongings that had remained in the family. The plans would include use of the cottage as a home by Phillips, who was one of the last remaining direct descendants of the Davies family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-20729290 |title="WH Davies signed books found in Gloucestershire cottage" at |publisher=BBC |date=24 December 2012 |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary style==
Davies' principal biographer Stonesifer likens the quality of Davies' prose, with its often childlike realism, directness and simplicity, to that of [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]] and [[George Borrow]], while Davies' style was described by [[G. B. Shaw|Shaw]] as that of "a genuine innocent",&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; while Hockey says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is as a poet of nature that Davies has become most famous; and it is not surprising that he should have taken nature as his main subject. He had lived close to the earth and in the open air, and had grown to love the countryside with its fields, woods and streams, its hedges and flowers, its birds and beasts, bees and butterflies, its sunny and cloudy skies and capricious moods: in short its infinite variety. Though a man of limited education, here he was at no disadvantage with an intellectual; for appreciation of nature is based not on intellect but on love and Davies loved nature deeply. His nature poetry is founded on his delight in nature, and he exulted in revealing the loveliness of heaven and earth and his interest in the creatures of the countryside. As does a child, a pagan or a mystic, he glorified nature and never ceased to regard it with eyes of wonder".&lt;ref&gt;Hockey, L. (1971), ''W. H. Davies'', [[University of Wales Press]] (on behalf of the [[Welsh Arts Council]]), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For his honorary degree in 1926, Davies was introduced to the assembly at the [[University of Wales]] by Professor W. D. Thomas, M.A. with a citation that may still serve as a summary of Davies' themes, style and tone:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A Welshman, a poet of distinction, and a man in whose work much of the peculiarly Welsh attitude to life is expressed with singular grace and sincerity. He combines a vivid sense of beauty with affection for the homely, keen zest for life and adventure with a rare appreciation of the common, universal pleasures, and finds in those simple things of daily life a precious quality, a dignity and a wonder that consecrate them. Natural, simple and unaffected, he is free from sham in feeling and artifice in expression. He has re-discovered for those who have forgotten them, the joys of simple nature. He has found romance in that which has become commonplace; and of the native impulses of an unspoilt heart, and the responses of a sensitive spirit, he has made a new world of experience and delight. He is a lover of life, accepting it and glorying in it. He affirms values that were falling into neglect, and in an age that is mercenary reminds us that we have the capacity for spiritual enjoyment."&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Somewhat surprisingly, his great friend and mentor, [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]], likened Davies to [[Wordsworth]], writing: "He can write commonplace or inaccurate English, but it is also natural to him to write, such as Wordsworth wrote, with the clearness, compactness and felicity which make a man think with shame how unworthily, through natural stupidity or uncertainty, he manages his native tongue. In subtlety he abounds, and where else today shall we find simplicity like this?"&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Howarth, P., (2003) ''English Literature in Transition 1880–1920'', Vol. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel George, who reviewed the 1943 ''Collected Poems'' for ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'', describes Davies' work, in his Foreword to the 1963 edition as ".. new yet old, recalling now [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Herrick]], now [[William Blake|Blake]] – of whom it was said, as of [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]], that he wrote like angel but (according to those who had met him) talked like poor Poll, except that he was no parrot of other people's opinions."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Poems of W. H. Davies'' (ed. Daniel George), London: Jonathan Cape, 1963, pp. xxv–xxvi, "Foreword".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance and character==
[[Osbert Sitwell]], who was a close friend of Davies, thought that he bore an "unmistakable likeness" to his distant actor cousin [[Henry Irving]]. Sitwell provides a vivid description of the poet's physical appearance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His cast of face was rather long and aquiline, but with broad high cheek bones, and all of it, chin, mouth, long upper lip, nose, and high forehead,  was finely sculptured and full of character. Features and hair both exhibited a naturally proud, backward slant or tilt, though there was no arrogance in him. His eyes were dark and gleaming, like those of a blackbird, and his skin possessed an almost nautical tinge. He was broad-shouldered and vigorous looking, but of less than middle height. Having lost a leg, he wore – for he could not afford the expense of a new metal limb – a heavy wooden stump, which made a wooden sound as he walked, and gave him a slow and very personal gait, making him raise and dip his shoulders as he moved.&lt;ref name=Sitwell/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing in the Introduction to his 1951 ''The Essential W. H. Davies'', Brian Waters said of Davies that "character and personality rather than good looks were the keynote to his expressive face", continuing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most people who never knew him have come to look on Davies as a Welshman. He was neither Welsh nor English, but an ancient Briton in whom the tribal character of the Silurian stock has persisted into the present century – a type frequently recognisable in Monmouthshire. He knew no word of Welsh, he was not carried away by the sentiments of others and the mass emotionalism was foreign to his nature. His emotions and sympathies were his own and he translated then into his poetry.&lt;ref name=waters&gt;Waters, B. (ed) (1951), ''The Essential W. H. Davies'', London: Jonathan Cape, (Introduction: W. H. Davies, Man and Poet, pp. 9–20)&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As I walked down the waterside 
This silent morning, wet and dark; 
Before the cocks in farmyards crowed, 
Before the dogs began to bark; 
Before the hour of five was struck 
By old Westminster's mighty clock:

As I walked down the waterside 
This morning, in the cold damp air, 
I saw a hundred women and men 
Huddled in rags and sleeping there: 
These people have no work, thought I, 
And long before their time they die.
 
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1926 Davies was honoured with the degree of [[Honorary degree|Doctor Litteris, honoris causa]] from the [[University of Wales]].&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; Davies returned to his native Newport in 1930, where a luncheon was held in his honour at the [[Westgate Hotel]].&lt;ref name=LLGC/&gt; His return, in September 1938, for the unveiling of the plaque in his honour, proved to be his last public appearance.&lt;ref name=Normand/&gt;

A large collection of Davies manuscripts, including a copy of "[[Leisure (poem)|Leisure]]", dated 8 May 1914, is held by the [[National Library of Wales]]. The collection includes a copy of "A Boy's Sorrow", an apparently unpublished poem of two eight-line stanzas relating to the death of a neighbour. Also included is a volume (c. 1916) containing autograph fair copies of 15 Davies poems, some of them apparently unpublished, submitted to James Guthrie (1874–1952) for publication by the Pear Tree Press as a collection entitled ''Quiet Streams'', to which annotations have been added by Lord Kenyon.&lt;ref name=LLGC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=4762 |title="W. H. Davies Manuscripts" at |publisher=Llgc.org.uk |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer [[Gerald Brenan]] (1894–1987) and his generation were influenced by Davies' ''Autobiography of a Super-Tramp''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Virginia |last=Nicholson |year=2003 |title=Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900–1939 |location= Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028978-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 Jonathan Cape published ''The Essential W. H. Davies'', selected and with an introduction by Brian Waters, a young Gloucestershire poet and writer whose work Davies admired, who described him as "about the last of England's professional poets". The collection included ''The Autobiography of a Super-tramp'', and extracts from ''Beggars'', ''A Poet's Pilgrimage'', ''Later Days'', ''My Birds'' and ''My Garden'', as well as over 100 poems arranged by publication period.

Many of Davies' poems have been given a musical setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/d/whdavies/ |title=Author: William Henry Davies (1871–1940) |publisher=recmusic.org |accessdate=25 July 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Money, O!" was set to music for piano, in [[G minor]], by [[Michael Head (composer)|Michael Head]] – his 1929 [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] collection also included settings for "The Likeness", "The Temper of a Maid", "Natures' Friend", "Robin Redbreast" and "A Great Time". "A Great Time" has also been set by Otto Freudenthal (b.1934), Wynn Hunt (b.1910) and Newell Wallbank (b.1914).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=4324]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also three songs by Sir [[Arthur Bliss]] – "Thunderstorms", "This Night", and "Leisure" – as well as "The Rain" for voice and piano, by Margaret Campbell Bruce, published in 1951 by [[Annie Jessy Curwen|J. Curwen and Sons]].

Experimental Irish folk group [[Dr. Strangely Strange]] also sang and quoted from "Leisure" on their 1970 album ''Heavy Petting'', with [[Pump organ|harmonium]] accompaniment. A musical adaptation of the same poem, with John Karvelas (vocals) and Nick Pitloglou (piano) and an animated film by Pipaluk Polanksi, may be found on YouTube. Also in 1970, [[Fleetwood Mac]] recorded "[[Dragonfly (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dragonfly]]", a song with lyrics taken from Davies' 1927 poem, "The Dragonfly". The song was also recorded by English singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Blake, for his 2011 album ''The First Snow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thisisblake.bandcamp.com/album/the-first-snow |title=The First Snow by Blake |publisher=Thisisblake.bandcamp.com |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 1 July 1971 a special [[First Day Cover]], with a matching commemorative post-mark was issued by the UK [[General Post Office|Post Office]] to mark Davies' centenary.

A controversial statue by Paul Bothwell-Kincaid, inspired by the poem "Leisure", was unveiled in [[Newport city centre|Commercial Street, Newport]] in December 1990, to commemorate Davies' work, on the 50th anniversary of his death. The bronze head of Davies by [[Jacob Epstein|Epstein]], from January 1917, regarded by many as the most accurate artistic impression of Davies and a copy of which Davies owned himself, may be found at [[Newport Museum|Newport Museum and Art Gallery]] (donated by [[Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar|Viscount Tredegar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tredegarhouse.wordpress.com/tag/w-h-davies/ |title=W.

In August 2010 the play ''Supertramp, Sickert and [[Jack the Ripper]]'' by Lewis Davies, concerning an imagined sitting by Davies for a portrait by [[Walter Sickert]], premiered at the [[Edinburgh Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/reviews/reviews_details.asp?reviewID=2387 |title=Supertramp, Sickert and Jack the Ripper at |publisher=Theatre-wales.co.uk |accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''West Memphis Three''' are three men who&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; while teenagers&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; were tried and convicted, in 1994, of the 1993 murders of three boys in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]]. '''Damien Echols''' was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], '''Jessie Misskelley, Jr.''' was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] plus two 20-year sentences, and '''Jason Baldwin''' was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. During the trial, the prosecution asserted that the children were killed as part of a [[Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic ritual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Youth Is Convicted In Slaying of 3 Boys In an Arkansas City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/05/us/youth-is-convicted-in-slaying-of-3-boys-in-an-arkansas-city.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 1994|quote=The prosecution said the slayings might have been part of a satanic ritual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arguments conclude in 'West Memphis Three' appeals|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2009/oct/02/appeals-continue-slayings-ark-boys-93|newspaper=[[Arkansas Online]]|date=October 2, 2009|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|quote=Prosecutors claimed the killers sexually mutilated the boy in a satanic ritual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Not-so-cold Old Cases|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=14536|work=Capital Punishment|publisher=Criminal Brief|author=Lundin, Leigh|location=Orlando|date=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of documentaries have explored the case. Celebrities and musicians have held fundraisers in the belief that the three young men convicted of the crime are innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-rockers-helped-free-the-west-memphis-three-20110901 |title=How Rockers Helped Free the West Memphis Three |author=Patrick Doyle |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=September 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, new [[forensic evidence]] was presented in the case. A status report jointly issued by the state and the defense team stated: "Although most of the [[DNA|genetic material]] recovered from the scene was attributable to the victims of the offenses, some of it cannot be attributed to either the victims or the defendants." On October 29, 2007, the defense filed a ''Second Amended Writ of Habeas Corpus'', outlining the new evidence.

Following a 2010 decision by the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] regarding newly produced DNA evidence and potential juror misconduct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/28/us-crime-dna-arkansas-idUSTRE76R0D920110728|title=Fresh DNA evidence boosts defense in 1993 Arkansas slayings|date=July 27, 2011|agency=Reuters|publisher=Thompson Reuters|first=Suzi|last=Parker|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the West Memphis Three negotiated a [[plea bargain]] with prosecutors. On August 19, 2011, they entered [[Alford plea]]s, which allowed them to assert their innocence while acknowledging that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict them. Judge David Laser accepted the pleas and sentenced the three to time served. They were released with 10-year [[suspended sentence]]s, having served 18 years and 78 days in prison.&lt;ref name=ArOnline/&gt;

==The crime==
Three eight-year-old boys—'''Steve Branch,''' '''Michael Moore,''' and '''Christopher Byers'''—were reported missing on May 5, 1993. The first report to the police was made by Byers' adoptive father, John Mark Byers, around 7:00&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three|last=Leveritt|first=Mara|year=2003|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-7434-1760-7|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys were allegedly last seen together by three neighbors, who in [[affidavit]]s told of seeing them playing together around 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm the evening they disappeared, and seeing Terry Hobbs, Steve Branch's stepfather, calling them to come home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Damien Echols asks for new trial in West Memphis 3 murder case|last=Blackstone|first=Ashley|date=September 30, 2010|work=Today's THV&amp;nbsp;– Gannett|publisher=Arkansas Television Company|url=http://www.todaysthv.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=120386|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}; [http://www.todaysthv.com/news/PDF/wm3.pdf Affidavits]&lt;/ref&gt; Initial police searches made that night were limited.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt; Friends and neighbors also conducted a search that night, which included a cursory visit to the location where the bodies were later found.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three|last=Leveritt|first=Mara|year=2003| publisher=[[Atria Books|Atria]]|isbn=0-7434-1760-7}} {{Page needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more thorough police search for the children began around 8:00&amp;nbsp;am on May 6, led by the Crittenden County Search and Rescue personnel. Searchers canvassed all of West Memphis but focused primarily on Robin Hood Hills, where the boys were reported last seen. Despite a shoulder-to-shoulder search of Robin Hood Hills by a human chain, searchers found no sign of the missing boys.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Around 1:45&amp;nbsp;pm, juvenile Parole Officer Steve Jones spotted a boy's black shoe floating in a muddy creek that led to a major drainage canal in Robin Hood Hills. A subsequent search of the ditch revealed the bodies of three boys. They had been stripped naked and were [[hogtie]]d with their own shoelaces: their right ankles tied to their right wrists behind their backs, the same with their left arms and legs. Their clothing was found in the creek, some of it twisted around sticks that had been thrust into the muddy ditch bed.&lt;ref name=Newton1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&amp;pg=PA391|title=The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes|author=Michael Newton|page=391|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year= 2009|accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clothing was mostly turned inside-out; two pairs of the boys' underwear were never recovered. Christopher Byers had lacerations to various parts of his body, and mutilation of his scrotum and penis.&lt;ref name=ByersAutopsy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Other/west%20memphis%20three/byers,%20christopher.pdf|title=Christopher Byers Autopsy|author=Frank J. Peretti, William Q. Sturner|work=Arkansas State Crime Laboratory|date=May 1993|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autopsies, by the forensic pathologist Frank J. Peretti, indicated that Byers died of "multiple injuries",&lt;ref name=ByersAutopsy/&gt; while Moore and Branch died of "multiple injuries with drowning".&lt;ref name=BranchAutopsy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autopsyfiles.org/reports/Other/west%20memphis%20three/branch,%20steve.pdf|title=Steve Branch Autopsy|author=Frank J.

Peretti, William Q. Sturner|work=Arkansas State Crime Laboratory|date=May 1993|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police initially suspected the boys had been raped;&lt;ref name=Newton1/&gt; however, later expert testimony disputed this finding despite trace amounts of sperm DNA found on a pair of pants recovered from the scene. Prosecution experts claim Byers' wounds were the results of a knife attack and that he had been purposely [[castration|castrated]] by the murderer; defense experts claim the injuries were more probably the result of post-mortem animal predation. Police believed the boys were assaulted and killed at the location where they were found; critics argued that the assault, at least, was unlikely to have occurred at the creek.

Byers was the only victim with drugs in his system; he was prescribed [[Ritalin]] (methylphenidate) in January 1993, as part of an [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] treatment.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt; The initial autopsy report describes the drug as [[Carbamazepine]], and that dosage was found to be at sub-therapeutic level. John Mark Byers said that Christopher Byers may not have taken his prescription on May 5, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSJ7Ja95oegC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Criminal profiling:an introduction to behavioral evidence analysis|first=Brent E.|last=Turvey|page=377|publisher=Academic|year=1999|accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Memphis Three victims memorial===
In 1994, a memorial was erected for the three murder victims. The memorial is located in the playground of Weaver Elementary School in West Memphis, where all three victims were second graders at the time of the crime. In May 2013, for the 20th anniversary of the slayings, Weaver Elementary School principal Sheila Grissom raised funds to refurbish the memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2013/04/21/help-sought-for-memorial-to-victims-in-west-memphis-3-case |title=Help sought for memorial to victims in West Memphis 3 case |work=Arkansas Times |year=2013 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspects==

===Baldwin, Echols, and Misskelley===

At the time of their arrests, Jessie Misskelley, Jr. was 17 years old, Jason Baldwin was 16 years old, and Damien Echols was 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00611F8395E0C758CDDAF0894DB494D81 | title=3 Teen-Agers Accused in the Killings of 3 Boys |work=New York Times | date=June 6, 1993 | accessdate =December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldwin and Echols had been previously arrested for [[vandalism]] and [[shoplifting]], respectively, and Misskelley had a reputation for his temper and for engaging in fistfights with other teenagers at school. Misskelley and Echols had dropped out of high school; however, Baldwin earned high grades and demonstrated a talent for drawing and sketching, and was encouraged by one of his teachers to study [[graphic design]] in college.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt; Echols and Baldwin were close friends, and bonded over their similar tastes in music and fiction, and over their shared distaste for the prevailing cultural climate of West Memphis, situated in the [[Bible Belt]]. Baldwin and Echols were acquainted with Misskelley from school, but were not close friends with him.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt;

Echols' family was poor and received frequent visits from [[social work]]ers, and he rarely attended school. He and a girlfriend had run off and later broken into a trailer during a rain storm; they were arrested, though only Echols was charged with burglary.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt;

Echols spent several months in a mental institution in Arkansas and afterward received "full disability" status from the [[Social Security Administration]].&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt; During Echols' trial, Dr. George W. Woods testified (for the defense) that Echols suffered from:

&lt;blockquote&gt;serious [[mental illness]] characterized by grandiose and persecutory delusions, auditory and visual [[hallucination]]s, disordered thought processes, substantial lack of insight, and chronic, incapacitating mood swings.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At his death penalty sentencing hearing, Echols' psychologist reported that months before the murders, Echols had claimed that he obtains super powers by drinking human blood.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Caro, [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-10-02/features/9610020073_1_victims-families-damien-echols-devil-worship/2 In Search Of Evil], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his arrest, Echols was working part-time with a roofing company and expecting a child with his girlfriend, Domini Teer.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt;

===Chris Morgan and Brian Holland===
Early in the investigation, the WMPD briefly regarded two West Memphis teenagers as suspects. Chris Morgan and Brian Holland, both with drug offense histories, had abruptly departed for [[Oceanside, California]], four days after the bodies were discovered.&lt;ref name="Lp2728"/&gt; Morgan was presumed to be at least casually familiar with all three murdered boys, having previously driven an ice cream truck route in their neighborhood.

Arrested in Oceanside on May 17, 1993, Morgan and Holland both took [[polygraph]] exams administered by California police. Examiners reported that both men's charts indicated deception when they denied involvement in the murders. During subsequent questioning, Morgan claimed a long history of drug and alcohol use, along with blackouts and memory lapses. He claimed that he "might have" killed the victims but quickly recanted this part of his statement.&lt;ref name="Lp2728"/&gt;

California police sent blood and urine samples from Morgan and Holland to the WMPD, but there is no indication WMPD investigated Morgan or Holland as suspects following their arrest in California. The relevance of Morgan's recanted statement would later be debated in trial, but it was eventually barred from admission as evidence.&lt;ref name="Lp2728"&gt;Leveritt, 2003, p. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Mr. Bojangles"===

The citing of a black male as a possible alternate suspect was implied during the beginning of the Misskelley trial. According to local West Memphis police officers, on the evening of May 5, 1993, at 8:42&amp;nbsp;pm, workers in the [[Bojangles' Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits|Bojangles']] restaurant located about a mile from the crime scene in Robin Hood Hills reported seeing a black male who seemed "mentally disoriented" inside the restaurant's ladies' room. The man was bleeding and had brushed against the restroom walls. Officer Regina Meeks responded to the call, taking the restaurant manager's report through the eatery's [[Drive-through|drive-through window]]. By then, the man had left, and police did not enter the restroom on that date.&lt;ref name="Leveritt6-174"&gt;{{cite book|title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three|last=Leveritt|first=Mara|year=2003|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-7434-1760-7|pages=6, 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the victims' bodies were found, Bojangles' manager Marty King, thinking there was a possible connection to the bloody man found in the bathroom, reported the incident to police officers who then inspected the ladies' room. King gave the officers a pair of sunglasses he thought the man had left behind, and the detectives took some blood samples from the walls and tiles of the restroom. Police detective Bryn Ridge testified that he later lost those blood scrapings. A hair identified as belonging to a black male was later recovered from a sheet wrapped around one of the victims.&lt;ref name="Leveritt6-174"/&gt;

==Investigation==
===Evidence and interviews===
Police officers James Sudbury and Steve Jones felt that the crime had "cult" overtones, and that Damien Echols might be a suspect because he had an interest in occultism, and Jones felt Echols was capable of murdering children.&lt;ref name=Newton1/&gt; The police interviewed Echols on May 7, two days after the bodies were discovered.&lt;ref name=Newton1/&gt; During a [[polygraph]] examination, he denied any involvement. The polygraph examiner claimed that Echols' chart indicated deception.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; On May 9, during a formal interview by Detective Bryn Ridge, Echols mentioned that one of the victims had wounds to the genitals; law enforcement viewed this knowledge as incriminating.&lt;ref name=Newton1/&gt;

After a month had passed with little progress in the case, police continued to focus their investigation upon Echols, interrogating him more frequently than any other person. Nonetheless, they claimed he was not regarded as a direct suspect but a source of information.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt;

On June 3, the police interrogated Jessie Misskelley, Jr. Despite his reported [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 72 (categorizing him as [[borderline intellectual functioning]]) and his status as a [[minor (law)|minor]], Miskelley was questioned alone; his parents were not present during the interrogation.&lt;ref name="CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; Misskelley's father gave permission for Misskelley to go with police but did not explicitly give permission for his son to be questioned or interrogated.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; Misskelley was questioned for roughly 12 hours. Only two segments, totaling 46 minutes, were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A4387647 |title=collective&amp;nbsp;– paradise lost, revelations dvd |publisher=BBC |date=July 10, 2005 |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321133722/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A4387647 |archivedate=March 21, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Misskelley quickly recanted his confession, citing intimidation, coercion, fatigue, and veiled threats from police.&lt;ref name="CB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; Misskelley specifically said he was "scared of the police" during this confession.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript, MissKelley, Jr. Confession&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was informed of his [[Miranda warning|Miranda]] rights, Misskelley later claimed he did not fully understand them.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; In 1996, the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] ruled that Misskelley's confession was voluntary and that he did, in fact, understand the Miranda warning and its consequences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinions.aoc.arkansas.gov/weblink8/0/doc/167688/Page1.aspx |title=cr94-848 |publisher=Arkansas Judiciary |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829222658/http://opinions.aoc.arkansas.gov/weblink8/0/doc/167688/Page1.aspx |archivedate=August 29, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of Misskelley's statements to the police were leaked to the press and reported on the front page of the Memphis ''[[The Commercial Appeal|Commercial Appeal]]'' before any of the trials began.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt;

Shortly after Misskelley's first confession, police arrested Echols and his close friend Baldwin. Eight months after his original confession, on February 17, 1994, Misskelley made another statement to police. His lawyer, Dan Stidham, remained in the room and continually advised Misskelley not to say anything. Misskelley ignored this advice and went on to detail how the boys were abused and murdered. Stidham, who was later elected to a municipal judgeship, has written a detailed critique{{citation needed|date=November 2013|reason=online sources are self-published, including http://murderpedia.org/male.E/e/echols-damien.htm }} of what he asserts are major police errors and misconceptions during their investigation. Stidham made similar comments during a radio show interview in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCwguAueFI0 |title=WM3 Interview With Dan Stidham, Part 1 of 11 |date=May 15, 2010 |access-date=March 10, 2018 |via=YouTube |publisher=Crime Scene Detectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vicki Hutcheson===
Vicki Hutcheson, a new resident of West Memphis, would play an important role in the investigation, though she would later recant her testimony, claiming her statements were fabricated due in part to coercion from police.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/memphis/index_1.html|author=Steel, Fiona|title=The West Memphis 3|date=March 17, 2006|publisher=Crimelibrary.com|accessdate=August 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314174108/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/memphis/index_1.html|archivedate=March 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 1993 (before the victims were found later the same day), Hutcheson took a [[polygraph]] exam by Detective Don Bray at the Marion Police Department, to determine whether or not she had stolen money from her West Memphis employer. Hutcheson's young son, Aaron, was also present, and proved such a distraction that Bray was unable to administer the polygraph. Aaron, a playmate of the murdered boys', mentioned to Bray that the boys had been killed at "the playhouse." When the bodies proved to have been discovered near where Aaron indicated, Bray asked Aaron for further details, and Aaron claimed that he had witnessed the murders committed by Satanists who spoke Spanish. Aaron's further statements were wildly inconsistent, and he was unable to identify Baldwin, Echols, or Misskelley from photo line-ups, and there was no "playhouse" at the location Aaron indicated. A police officer leaked portions of Aaron's statements to the press contributing to the growing belief that the murders were part of a Satanic rite.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

On or about June 1, 1993, Hutcheson agreed to police suggestions to place hidden microphones in her home during an encounter with Echols. Misskelley agreed to introduce Hutcheson to Echols. During their conversation, Hutcheson reported that Echols made no incriminating statements. Police said the recording was "inaudible", but Hutcheson claimed the recording was audible. On June 2, 1993, Hutcheson told police that about two weeks after the murders were committed, she, Echols, and Misskelley attended a [[Wicca]]n meeting in [[Turrell, Arkansas]]. Hutcheson claimed that, at the Wiccan meeting, a drunken Echols openly bragged about killing the three boys. Misskelley was first questioned on June 3, 1993, a day after Hutcheson's purported confession. Hutcheson was unable to recall the Wiccan meeting location and did not name any other participants in the purported meeting. Hutcheson was never charged with theft. She claimed she had implicated Echols and Misskelley to avoid facing criminal charges, and to obtain a reward for the discovery of the murderers.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;

==Trials==
Misskelley was tried separately, and Echols and Baldwin were tried together in 1994. Under the "[[Bruton rule]]", Misskelley's confession could not be admitted against his co-defendants; thus he was tried separately. All three defendants pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers|title=Teens Plead Innocent In Boys' Deaths|publisher=[[Times Daily]]|date=August 4, 1993|accessdate=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misskelley's trial===
During Misskelley's trial, Dr. [[Richard Ofshe]], an expert on [[false confessions]] and police coercion, and Professor of Sociology at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], testified that the brief recording of Misskelley's interrogation was a "classic example" of police [[coercion]].&lt;ref name="courttv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/memphis/index_1.html|title=The West Memphis Three|first=Fiona|last=Steel|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314174108/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/famous/memphis/index_1.html|archivedate=March 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also stated that Misskelley's various "confessions" were in many respects inconsistent with each other, as well as with the particulars of the crime scene and murder victims, including (for example) an "admission" that Misskelley watched Damien rape one of the boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/magazine/a-death-row-love-story.html |title=A Death-Row Love Story |first=Geoffrey |last=Gray |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 13, 2011 |access-date=March 10, 2018 |quote=Then a teenager, Jessie Misskelley Jr., told the police that he saw his friend, Jason Baldwin, and another teenager, Damien Echols, go into the woods with the boys and rape them. Misskelley later recanted }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police had initially suspected that the victims had been raped because their anuses were dilated. However, there was no forensic evidence indicating that the murdered boys had been raped. Dilation of the anus is a normal post-mortem condition.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt;

On February 5, 1994, Misskelley was convicted by a jury of one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;"Arkansas Teen Found Guilty On Three Counts Of Murder," ''Gainesville Sun'', February 5, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The court sentenced him to life plus 40 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Youth Is Convicted In Slaying of 3 Boys In an Arkansas City|work=The New York Times|date=February 5, 1994|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE5DA1E39F936A35751C0A962958260&amp;scp=11&amp;sq=west+memphis+3+murder+case&amp;st=nyt}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conviction was appealed, but the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidjauss.com/miscellaneous_essays_and_interviews_51285.htm|title=Miscellaneous Essays and Interviews - David Jauss|website=www.davidjauss.com|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Echols' and Baldwin's trial===
Three weeks later, Echols and Baldwin went on trial. The prosecution accused the three young men of committing a Satanic murder. The prosecution called Dale W. Griffis, a graduate of the unaccredited [[Columbia Pacific University]], as an expert in the occult to testify the murders were a Satanic ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/1994/mar/09/witnesses-call-boys-deaths-work-group-trappings-oc/?print=1|title=Witnesses call boys deaths work of group with trappings of the occult|publisher=[[The Commercial Appeal]] |date=March 9, 1994|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 1994 Echols and Baldwin were found guilty on three counts of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wuYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tQcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5353,3505240&amp;dq=baldwin+echols+and+misskelley&amp;hl=en|title=Teens Found Guilty In Boys' Slayings|work=[[Free Lance-Star]]|date=March 19, 1994|accessdate =December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court sentenced Echols to death and Baldwin to life in prison.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;

At trial, the defense team argued that news articles from the time could have been the source for Echols' knowledge about the genital mutilation, and Echols said his knowledge was limited to what was "on TV".

The prosecution claimed that Echols' knowledge was nonetheless too close to the facts, since there was no public reporting of drowning or that one victim had been mutilated more than the others. Echols testified that Detective Ridge's description of their earlier conversation (which was not recorded) regarding those particular details was inaccurate (and indeed that some other claims by Ridge were "lies"). Mara Leveritt, an investigative journalist and the author of ''[[Devil's Knot]]'', argues that Echols' information may have come from police leaks, such as Detective Gitchell's comments to Mark Byers, that circulated amongst the local public.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "courttv"/&gt; The defense team objected when the prosecution attempted to question Echols about his past violent behaviors, but the defense objections were overruled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three|last=Leveritt|first=Mara|year=2003|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-7434-1760-7|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Criticism of the investigation===
[[File:Free the West Memphis Three.jpg|thumb|Protestors followed the trial]]
There has been widespread criticism of how the police handled the [[crime scene]].&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; Misskelley's former attorney Dan Stidham cites multiple substantial police errors at the crime scene, characterizing it as "literally trampled, especially the creek bed." The bodies, he said, had been removed from the water before the coroner arrived to examine the scene and determine the state of [[rigor mortis]], allowing the bodies to decay on the creek bank and to be exposed to sunlight and insects. The police did not telephone the coroner until almost two hours after the discovery of the floating shoe, resulting in a late appearance by the coroner. Officials failed to drain the creek in a timely manner and secure possible evidence in the water (the creek was sandbagged after the bodies were pulled from the water).

Moreover, Stidham calls the coroner's investigation "extremely substandard." There was a small amount of blood found at the scene that was never tested. According to HBO's documentaries ''[[Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills]]'' (1996) and ''[[Paradise Lost 2: Revelations]]'' (2000), no blood was found at the crime scene, indicating that the location where the bodies were found was not necessarily the location where the murders actually happened. After the initial investigation, the police failed to control disclosure of information and speculation about the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three |last=Leveritt |first=Mara |year=2003| publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-7434-1760-7 |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Leveritt, "Police records were a mess. To call them disorderly would be putting it mildly."&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; Leveritt speculated that the small local police force was overwhelmed by the crime, which was unlike any they had ever investigated. Police refused an unsolicited offer of aid and consultation from the violent crimes experts of the [[Arkansas State Police]], and critics suggested this was due to the WMPD's being under investigation by the Arkansas State Police for suspected theft from the [[Crittenden County, Arkansas|Crittenden County]] drug task force.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; Leveritt further noted that some of the physical evidence was stored in paper sacks obtained from a supermarket (with the supermarket's name printed on the bags) rather than in containers of known and controlled origin.

When police speculated about the assailant, the juvenile probation officer assisting at the scene of the murders speculated that Echols was "capable" of committing the murders," stating: "it looks like Damien Echols finally killed someone."&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt;

Brent Turvey, a forensic scientist and criminal profiler, stated in the film ''Paradise Lost 2'' that human bite marks could have been left on at least one of the victims. However, these potential bite marks were first noticed in photographs years after the trials and were not inspected by a board-certified medical examiner until four years after the murders. The defense's expert testified that the mark in question was not an adult bite mark, while experts put on by the State concluded that there was no bite mark at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three |last=Leveritt |first=Mara |year=2003 | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-7434-1760-7 |pages=399, 404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State's experts had examined the actual bodies for any marks, and others conducted expert photo analysis of injuries. Upon further examination, it was concluded that if the marks were bite marks, they did not match the teeth of any of the three convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239894/|title=''Revelations: Paradise Lost 2''. HBO. 28&amp;nbsp;July&amp;nbsp;2000 Broadcast. March 17, 2006|accessdate=February 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals and new evidence==
In May 1994, the three defendants appealed their convictions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Appeal puts 3 Ark. boys' murders back in spotlight |publisher=[[Seattle Post Intelligencer]] | date=May 5, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; the convictions were upheld on direct appeal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Misskelley v.

In 2007, Echols petitioned for a retrial, based on a statute permitting post-conviction testing of DNA evidence due to technological advances made since 1994 which might provide [[exoneration]] for the wrongfully convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Weinstein,

===John Mark Byers' knife (1993)===
John Mark Byers, the adoptive father of victim Christopher Byers, gave a knife to cameraman Doug Cooper, who was working with documentary makers [[Joe Berlinger]] and Bruce Sinofsky while filming the first ''[[Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills|Paradise Lost]]'' feature. The knife was a folding [[hunting knife]] manufactured by [[Kershaw Knives|Kershaw]]. According to the statements given by Berlinger and Sinofsky, Cooper informed them of his receipt of the knife on December 19, 1993. After the documentary crew returned to New York, Berlinger and Sinofsky were reported to have discovered what appeared to be blood on the knife. HBO executives ordered them to return the knife to the West Memphis Police Department. The knife was not received at the West Memphis Police Department until January 8, 1994.

Byers initially claimed the knife had never been used. However, after blood was found on the knife, Byers stated that he had used it only once, to cut deer meat. When told the blood matched both his and Chris' blood type, Byers said he had no idea how that blood might have gotten on the knife. During interrogation, West Memphis police suggested to Byers that he might have left the knife out accidentally, and Byers agreed with this.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; Byers later stated that he may have cut his thumb. Further testing of the knife produced inconclusive results about the source of the blood. Uncertainty remained due to the small amount of blood&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt; and because both John Mark Byers and Chris Byers had the same [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]-DQα genotype.

Byers agreed to and passed a polygraph test about the murders during the filming of ''Paradise Lost 2: Revelations'', but the documentary indicated that Byers was under the influence of several [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive prescription]] [[Pharmaceutical drug|medications]] that could have affected the test results.

===Possible teeth imprints (1996–1997)===
Following their convictions, Echols, Misskelley, and Baldwin submitted imprints of their teeth. These were compared to the alleged bite marks on Stevie Branch's forehead that had not been mentioned in the original autopsy or trial. No matches were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three |last=Leveritt |first=Mara |year=2003 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-7434-1760-7 |pages=334–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Mark Byers had his teeth removed in 1997, after the first trial but before an imprint could be made. His stated reasons for the removal are apparently contradictory. He has claimed both that the [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] medication he was taking caused [[Periodontal pathology|periodontal disease]], and that he planned the removal because of other kinds of dental problems which had troubled him for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three |last=Leveritt |first=Mara |year=2003 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-7434-1760-7 |pages=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an expert examined autopsy photos and noted what he thought might be the imprint of a belt buckle on Byers' corpse, the elder Byers revealed to the police that he had [[spanking|spanked]] his stepson shortly before the boy disappeared.&lt;ref name="Leveritt03" /&gt;

===Vicki Hutcheson's recantation (2003)===

In October 2003, Vicki Hutcheson, who had played a part in the arrests of Misskelley, Echols, and Baldwin, gave an interview to the ''[[Arkansas Times]]'' in which she stated that every word she had given to the police was a fabrication.&lt;ref name="AT100704"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Tim|last=Hackler|title=Complete Fabrication|url=https://www.arktimes.com/arkansas/complete-fabrication/Content?oid=1886107|work=[[Arkansas Times]]|date=October 7, 2004|access-date=May 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She further asserted that the police had implied that if she did not cooperate with them they would take away her child.&lt;ref name="AT100704"/&gt; She said that when she visited the police station, employees had photographs of Echols, Baldwin, and Misskelley on the wall and were using them as [[darts|dart]] targets.&lt;ref name="AT100704"/&gt; She also claims that an audiotape the police said was "unintelligible" (and that they eventually lost) was perfectly clear and contained no incriminating statements.&lt;ref name="AT100704"/&gt;

===DNA testing and new physical evidence (2007)===
In 2007, DNA collected from the crime scene was tested. None was found to match DNA from Echols, Baldwin, or Misskelley. A hair "not inconsistent with" Stevie Branch's stepfather, Terry Hobbs, was found tied into the knots used to bind one of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;Mara Leveritt and Max Brantley [http://www.arktimes.com/Articles/ArticleViewer.aspx?ArticleID=f1b058c2-82ac-455c-b193-83cfce18215d New evidence in West Memphis murders], ''Arkansas Times'', July 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors, while conceding that no DNA evidence tied the accused to the crime scene, said: "The State stands behind its convictions of Echols and his codefendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kait8.com/Global/story.asp?S=6820082&amp;nav=0jsh|title=KAIT: Mother of West Memphis 3 Victim Speaks About New DNA Evidence|publisher=Kait8.com|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pamela Hobbs' May 5, 2009 declaration in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Arkansas, Western Division indicates that "one hair was consistent with the hair of [Terry's] friend, David Jacoby" (Point 16), and:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hobbs, Pamela Marie|url=http://callahan.8k.com/wm3/p_hobbs_declaration1.html|title=Declaration of Pamela Marie Hobbs|publisher=THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS, WESTERN DIVISION, ''TERRY HOBBS, Plaintiff, v.

{{quote|17. Additionally, after the Murders my sister Jo Lynn McCauhey and I found in Terry's nightstand a knife that Stevie carried with him constantly and which I had believed was with him when he died. It was a pocket knife that my father had given to Stevie, and Stevie loved that knife. I had been shocked that the police did not find it with Stevie when they found his body. I had always assumed that my son's murderer had taken the knife during the crime. I could not believe it was in Terry's things. He had never told me that he had it.

18. Also, my sister Jo Lynn told me that she saw Terry wash clothes, bed linens and curtains from Stevie's room at an odd time around the time of the Murders.

19. There was additional new evidence discovered in 2007 that I cannot now recall.}}

===Foreman and jury misconduct (2008)===
In July 2008, it was revealed that Kent Arnold, the jury foreman on the Echols-Baldwin trial, had discussed the case with an attorney prior to the beginning of deliberations. Arnold was accused of advocating for the guilt of the West Memphis Three and sharing knowledge of inadmissible evidence, like the Jessie Misskelley statements, with other jurors.&lt;ref name="ForemanArnold"&gt;Beth Warren, "[http://westmemphisthreediscussion.yuku.com/topic/8273/t/Jury-foreman--West-Memphis-Three-trial--Damien-Echols-accus.html Jury foreman in West Memphis Three trial of Damien Echols accused of misconduct]," ''[[Memphis Commercial Appeal]]'', October 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, legal experts agreed that this issue could result in the reversal of the convictions of Jason Baldwin and Damien Echols.&lt;ref name="ForemanArnold"/&gt;

In September 2008, attorney (now judge) Daniel Stidham, who represented Misskelley in 1994, testified at a postconviction relief hearing. Stidham testified under oath that during the trial, Judge David Burnett erred by making an improper communication with the jury during its deliberations. Stidham overheard Judge Burnett discuss taking a lunch break with the jury foreman and heard the foreman reply that the jury was almost finished. He testified Judge Burnett responded, "You'll need food for when you come back for sentencing," and that the foreman asked in return what would happen if the defendant was acquitted. Stidham said the judge closed the door without answering. He testified that his own failure to put this incident on the court record and his failure to meet the minimum requirements in state law to represent a defendant in a capital murder case was evidence of [[ineffective assistance of counsel]] and that Misskelley's conviction should therefore be vacated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former lawyer supports effort for a new trial |author=The Associated Press |work=Arkansas Online |publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc |date=September 30, 2008 |url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2008/sep/30/former-lawyer/ |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Request for retrial (2007–2010)===
On October 29, 2007, papers were filed in federal court by Echols's defense lawyers seeking a [[retrial]] or his immediate release from prison. The filing cited DNA evidence linking Terry Hobbs (stepfather of one of the victims) to the crime scene, and new statements from Hobbs' now ex-wife. Also presented in the filing was new expert testimony that the supposed knife marks on the victims, including the injuries to Byers' genitals, were in fact the result of animal predation after the bodies had been dumped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arktimes.com/blogs/arkansasblog/2007/11/west_memphis_3_press_conferenc.aspx Arkansas Blog: West Memphis 3 Press Conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103111907/http://www.arktimes.com/blogs/arkansasblog/2007/11/west_memphis_3_press_conferenc.aspx |date=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2008, Circuit Court Judge David Burnett denied the request for a retrial, citing the DNA tests as inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nesting.com/news/national/131401/Judge-rejects-request-for-new-trial-for-3-men-convicted-of-1993-slayings-of-3-Arkansas-boys.html |title=Judge rejects request for new trial for 3 men convicted of 1993 slayings of 3 Arkansas boys |agency=Associated Press |first=Jill |last=Zeman |work=Nesting.com |accessdate=January 25, 2012 |date=September 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913182412/http://www.nesting.com/news/national/131401/Judge-rejects-request-for-new-trial-for-3-men-convicted-of-1993-slayings-of-3-Arkansas-boys.html |archivedate=September 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; That ruling was appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the case on September 30, 2010.

===Arkansas Supreme Court ruling (2010)===
On November 4, 2010, the Arkansas Supreme Court ordered a lower judge to consider whether newly analyzed DNA evidence might exonerate the three.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; The justices also instructed the lower court to examine claims of misconduct by the jurors who sentenced Damien Echols to death and Jessie Misskelley and Jason Baldwin to life in prison.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ARKANSAS_BOYS_SLAIN?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=New hearing ordered for 3 in Ark. scout deaths|author=Bleed, Jill Zeman|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=November 10, 2010|date= November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2010, David Burnett was elected to the [[Arkansas Senate#Members of the 89th Senate|Arkansas State Senate]]. Circuit Court Judge David Laser was selected to replace David Burnett and preside in the evidentiary hearings mandated by the successful appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2010/dec/01/new-judge-appointed-west-memphis-appeals/?news|title=New judge appointed for West Memphis appeals|agency=The Associated Press|work=Arkansas Online|publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plea deal and release (2011)===
After weeks of negotiations, on August 19, 2011, Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley were released from prison as part of a plea deal, making the hearings ordered by the Arkansas Supreme Court unnecessary.&lt;ref name=nyt_alford/&gt; The three entered into unusual [[Alford plea]] deals. The Alford plea is a legal mechanism that allows defendants to plead guilty while still asserting their actual innocence, in cases where defendants concede that prosecutors have sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. Stephen Braga, an attorney with Ropes &amp; Gray who took up Echols's defense on a [[pro bono]] basis beginning in 2009, negotiated the plea agreement with prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Randazzo|first=Sara|title=The Ropes &amp; Gray Partner Who Helped Free the West Memphis Three|url=http://www.ropesgray.com/files/upload/002081104RopesGray.pdf|publisher=American Lawyer Daily|accessdate=September 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406021648/http://www.ropesgray.com/files/upload/002081104RopesGray.pdf|archivedate=April 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the deal, Judge David Laser vacated the previous convictions, including the capital murder convictions for Echols and Baldwin, and ordered a new trial. Each man then entered an Alford plea to lesser charges of first- and second-degree murder while verbally stating their innocence. Judge Laser then sentenced them to [[time served]], a total of 18 years and 78 days, and they were each given a suspended imposition of sentence for 10 years.&lt;ref name=nyt_alford&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/us/20arkansas.html|newspaper= The New York Times|title=Deal Frees 'West Memphis Three' in Arkansas|first=Campbell|last=Robertson|date=August 19, 2011|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they re-offend they can be sent back to prison for 21 years.&lt;ref name=ArOnline/&gt;

Factors cited by prosecutor Scott Ellington for agreeing to the plea deal included that two of the victims' families had joined the cause of the defense, that the mother of a witness who testified about Echols's confession had questioned her daughter's truthfulness, and that the State Crime Lab employee who collected fiber evidence at the Echols and Baldwin homes after their arrests had died.&lt;ref&gt;Max Brantley, [http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2011/08/19/prosecutors-statement-on-west-memphis-3-plea-deal Prosecutor's statement on West Memphis 3 plea deal] ''[[Arkansas Times]]'' August 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the plea deal, the three men cannot pursue civil action against the state for wrongful imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ozarksfirst.com/fulltext?nxd_id=511867 |title=West Memphis Three Attorneys Discuss Alford Plea Details|publisher=Maxwell S. Kennerly |last=Libby |first=Karen |date=August 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the men's supporters, and opponents who still believe them guilty, were unhappy with the unusual plea deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leveritt |first=Mara |title=FLASH: West Memphis 3 freed in plea bargain |work=Arkansas Blog |publisher=Arkansas Times |date=August 19, 2011 |url=http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2011/08/19/flash-west-memphis-3-freed-in-plea-bargain-on-1993-murders |accessdate=January 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, supporters pushed Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe to pardon Echols, Baldwin, and Misskelley based on their innocence. Beebe said he would deny the request unless there was evidence showing someone else committed the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=West Memphis 3, locked up 18 years, together in NY |last=Bauder |first=David |date=October 10, 2011 |work=Houston Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |url=http://www.chron.com/default/article/West-Memphis-3-locked-up-18-years-together-in-NY-2211385.php |accessdate=January 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutor Scott Ellington said the Arkansas state crime laboratory would help seek other suspects by running searches on any DNA evidence produced in private laboratory tests during the defense team's investigation. This would include running the results through the FBI's [[CODIS|Combined DNA Index System]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arkansas crime lab to study 'West Memphis 3' case DNA |last=Demillo |first=Andrew |agency=Associated Press |work=The Commercial Appeal |publisher=Scripps Newspaper Group—Online |date=August 27, 2011 |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/aug/27/ark-crime-lab-to-study-wm3-case-dna/?print=1 |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellington said that, although he still considered the men guilty, the three would likely be acquitted if a new trial were held because of the powerful legal counsel representing them now, the loss of evidence over time, and the change of heart among some of the witnesses.&lt;ref name=nyt_alford/&gt;

==Family and law enforcement opinions==
The families of the three victims are divided in their opinions as to the guilt or innocence of the West Memphis Three. In 2000, the biological father of Christopher Byers, Rick Murray, expressed his doubts about the guilty verdicts on the West Memphis Three website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rick Murray speaks out |work=Free the West Memphis Three |url=http://www.wm3.org/live/thevictims/letter.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703223027/http://www.wm3.org/live/thevictims/letter.php |archivedate=July 3, 2007 |date=May 2000 |last=Rick |first=Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Pamela Hobbs, the mother of victim Stevie Branch, joined those who have publicly questioned the verdicts, calling for a reopening of the verdicts and further investigation of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Arkansas Times |last1=Leveritt |first1=Mara |last2=Brantley |first2=Max |title=New evidence in West Memphis murders |date=July 19, 2007 |url=http://www.arktimes.com/gyrobase/new-evidence-in-west-memphis-murders/Content?oid=868140&amp;showFullText=true |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2007, John Mark Byers—who was previously vehement in his belief that Echols, Misskelley, and Baldwin were guilty—also announced that he now believes that they are innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Father of Victim to Convicted Killer: "I'm Here for You" |last=Avila |first=Jim |date=November 1, 2007 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3808760&amp;page=1#.Tx82L4F9tBk |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I had made the comment if it were ever proven the three were innocent, I'd be the first to lead the charge for their freedom," said Byers, and take "every opportunity that I have to voice that the West Memphis Three are innocent and the evidence and proof prove they're innocent."&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;Alex Coleman, "[http://www.wreg.com/wreg-mark-byers-story,0,2109569.story Victim's father wants West Memphis 3 set free]", [[WREG]], February 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Byers has spoken to the media on behalf of the convicted, and has expressed his desire for justice for the families of both the victims and the three accused.&lt;ref name="coleman" /&gt;

In 2010, district Judge Brian S. Miller ordered Terry Hobbs, the stepfather of victim Stevie Branch, to pay $17,590 to [[Dixie Chicks]] singer [[Natalie Maines]] for legal costs stemming from a [[defamation]] lawsuit he filed against the band. Miller dismissed a suit Hobbs filed over Maines' remarks and writings implying that he was involved in killing his stepson. The judge said Hobbs had chosen to involve himself in public discussion over whether the convictions were just.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20002775-504083.html Dixie Chicks' Natalie Maines Wins "West Memphis Three" Defamation Suit], ''[[CNN]]'', April 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John E. Douglas]], a former longtime FBI agent and current criminal profiler, said that the murders were more indicative of a single murderer intent on degrading and punishing the victims, than of a trio of "unsophisticated" teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/nov/07/profiler-convinced-innocence-west-memphis-three/?print=1 |date=November 7, 2010 |title=Professional profiler convinced of innocence of West Memphis Three |work=The Commercial Appeal |location=Memphis, TN |publisher=Scripps Newspaper Group—Online |last=Warren |first=Beth |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112094254/http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/nov/07/profiler-convinced-innocence-west-memphis-three/?print=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas believed that the perpetrator had a violent history and was familiar with the victims and with local geography. Douglas was formerly FBI Unit Chief for 25 years of the Investigative Support Unit of the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]]. He stated in his report for Echols's legal team that there was no evidence the murders were linked to satanic rituals and that post-mortem animal predation could explain the alleged knife injuries. He said that the victims had died from a combination of blunt force trauma and drowning, in a crime which he believed was driven by personal cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eldoradonews.com/news/2017/oct/13/mindhunter-former-fbi-unit-chief-recalls-high-prof/ |newspaper=El Dorado News-Times |title=Mindhunter: Former FBI unit chief recalls high-profile cases |date=October 11, 2017 |first=Brittany |last=Williams |access-date=March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentaries, publications and studies==
Three films, ''[[Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills]]'', ''[[Paradise Lost 2: Revelations]]'', and ''[[Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory]]'', directed by [[Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky]], have documented this case and are strongly critical of the verdict. The films marked the first time [[Metallica]] allowed their music to be used in a movie, which drew attention to the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432105/19980528/metallica.jhtml | title=Metallica May Give Music To "Paradise Lost" Sequel |publisher=MTV | date=May 28, 1998 | accessdate =November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of books about the case, also arguing that the suspects were wrongly convicted: ''[[Devil's Knot]]'' by Mara Leveritt; ''Blood of Innocents'' by Guy Reel; and ''The Last Pentacle of the Sun: Writings in Support of the West Memphis Three'', edited by Brett Alexander Savory &amp; M. W. Anderson, and featuring dark fiction and non-fiction by well-known writers of speculative fiction. In 2005, Damien Echols completed his memoir, ''Almost Home, Vol 1'', offering his perspective of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Almost Home: My Life Story Vol 1|first=Damien|last=Echols|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|date=June 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biography of John Mark Byers by Greg Day was published in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Day, "[http://www.johnmarkbyers.com/Introduction.html Untying The Knot: John Mark Byers and the West Memphis child murders]".

Many songs were written about the case, and two albums released in support of the defendants. In 2000, The album ''[[Free the West Memphis 3]]'' was released by [[KOCH Records]]. Organized by [[Eddie Spaghetti]] of the band [[Supersuckers]], the album featured a number of original songs about the case and other recordings by artists such as [[Steve Earle]], [[Tom Waits]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], and [[Joe Strummer]]. In 2002, [[Henry Rollins]] worked with other vocalists from various rock, hip hop, punk and metal groups and members of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and the [[Rollins Band]] on the compilation album ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]''. All money raised from sales of the album are donated to the legal funds of the West Memphis Three. Metalcore band [[Zao (US band)|Zao]]'s 2002 album ''Parade of Chaos'' included a track inspired by the case named "Free The Three". On April 28, 2011, the band [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] released a song entitled "3" as a download on their website. The song is about the West Memphis Three, with 100% of the proceeds going to their benefit foundation for their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disturbed Release Benefit Single for West Memphis Three |date=April 30, 2011 |publisher=Starpulse.com |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/04/30/disturbed_release_benefit_single_for_w |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A website by Martin David Hill, containing approximately 160,000 words and intending to be a "thorough investigation", collates and discusses many details surrounding the murders and investigation, including some anecdotal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jivepuppi.com/index.html|title=Murders in West Memphis|author=Martin David Hill|accessdate=August 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigative journalist [[Aphrodite Jones]] undertook an exploration of the case on her [[Discovery Network]] show ''True Crime With Aphrodite Jones'' following the DNA discoveries. The episode premiered May 5, 2011, with extensive background information included on the show's page at the Investigation Discovery site. In August 2011, White Light Productions announced that the West Memphis Three would be featured on their new program ''Wrongfully Convicted''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-655378 | publisher=CNN | title=West Memphis Three 'Wrongully Convicted Episode Trailer White Light Productions'&amp;nbsp;– CNN iReport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the CBS television news journal ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'' aired "The Memphis 3", an in-depth coverage of the history of the case including interviews with Echols and supporters. On September 17, 2011, ''48 Hours'' re-aired the episode with the update of their release and interviews from Echols and his wife, and Baldwin. ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]'' aired an episode on September 29, 2011, about the three's plans for the future and continued investigations on the case.&lt;ref name="cnn2011"/&gt;

''[[West of Memphis]]'', directed and written by [[Amy J. Berg]], and produced by [[Peter Jackson]], as well as by Echols himself, premiered at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]]. Actor [[Johnny Depp]], a longtime supporter of the West Memphis Three and personal friend of Damien Echols, was on hand to support the film in its premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1693481/johnny-depp-west-of-memphis-2012-tiff.jhtml |last=Rosenfield |first=Kat |publisher=MTV |title=Johnny Depp Reveals Anguish Over West Memphis Three Injustice |date=September 9, 2012 |access-date=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Colin Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/02/10/devils-knot-reese-witherspoon-west-memphis-three-release-date/ |last=Labrecque |first=Jeff |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |title=West Memphis Three drama 'Devil's Knot' with Reese Witherspoon sets release |date=February 10, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defendants==

===Jessie Misskelley===
Jessie Misskelley Jr. (born July 10, 1975) was arrested in connection to the murders of May 5, 1993. After a reported 12 hours of interrogation by police, Misskelley, who has an IQ of 72, confessed to the murders, and implicated Baldwin and Echols. However, the confession was at odds with facts known by police, such as the time of the murders.&lt;ref name=ArOnline&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/aug/19/breaking-plea-reached-west-memphis-murders/?breaking

Misskelley was convicted by a jury of one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. The court sentenced him to [[life in prison|life]] plus 40 years in prison. His conviction was appealed and affirmed by the Arkansas Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On August 19, 2011, Misskelley, along with Baldwin and Echols, entered an [[Alford plea]]. Judge David Laser then sentenced them to 18 years and 78 days, the amount of time they had served, and also levied a suspended sentence of 10 years. All three were released from prison that same day.&lt;ref name=nyt_alford/&gt; Since his release, Misskelley has become engaged to his high school girlfriend and enrolled in a community college to train as an auto mechanic.

===Charles Jason Baldwin===

The judge then sentenced the three men to 18 years and 78 days, the amount of time they had served, and also levied a suspended sentence of 10 years.

Baldwin was initially resistant to agree to this deal, insisting as a matter of principle that he would not plead guilty to something he did not do. But, he said, his refusal would have meant that Echols stayed on death row. "This was not justice," he said of the deal. "However, they're trying to kill Damien."&lt;ref name=nyt_alford/&gt; Since his release, Baldwin has moved to Seattle to live with friends. He is in a relationship with a woman who befriended him while he was in prison.

===Damien Wayne Echols===
Damien Wayne Echols (born Michael Wayne Hutchison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perrusquia|first=Marc|title=Damien Echols may be troubled but he's not killer, some say|newspaper=The Commercial Appeal|location=Memphis|date=February 27, 1994|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/1994/feb/27/damien-echols-may-be-troubled-hes-not-killer-some-|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; December 11, 1974) was on death row, locked-down 23 hours per day at the [[Varner Unit]] Supermax.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt; On August 19, 2011, Echols, along with Baldwin and Misskelley, was released from prison after their attorneys and the judge handling the upcoming retrial agreed to a deal. Under the terms of the Alford guilty plea, Echols and his co-defendants accepted the sufficiency of evidence supporting the three counts of [[first degree murder]] while maintaining their innocence. DNA evidence at the scene was not found to include any from Echols or his co-defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/us/30satanic.html |title=Defense Offers New Evidence in a Murder Case That Shocked Arkansas |date=October 30, 2007 |newspaper=The New York Times |first=-Shaila |last=Dewan |quote=according to long-awaited new evidence ..., there was no DNA from the three defendants found at the scene }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Appeal====
Echols' mental stability during the years immediately prior to the murders and during his trial was the focus of his appellate legal team in their appeal attempts. In his efforts to win a new trial, Echols, 27 at the time of the appeal, claimed he was incompetent to stand trial because of a history of mental illness. The record on appeal spells out a long history of Echols' mental health problems, including a May 5, 1992, Arkansas Department of Youth Services referral for possible mental illness, a year to the day before the murders.&lt;ref name="The Commercial Appeal"&gt;[http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2002/apr/21/case-lives-echols-seeks-new-trial/ The Commercial Appeal]&lt;/ref&gt; Hospital records for his treatment in Little Rock 11 months before the killings show a history of self-mutilation and assertions to hospital staff that he gained power by drinking blood, that he had inside him the spirit of a woman who had killed her husband, and that he was having [[hallucinations]]. He also told mental health workers that he was "going to influence the world."&lt;ref name="The Commercial Appeal"/&gt;

The appellate legal team argued that Echols did not waive his assertion that he was not mentally competent before his 1994 trial because he was not competent to waive it. To assist in the appeals process, Echols' appellate legal team retained a [[Berkeley, California]]-based forensic psychiatrist, Dr. George Woods, to make their case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;cp=22&amp;gs_id=1v&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=george+woods+affidavit&amp;qe=Z2VvcmdlIHdvb2RzIGFmZmlkYXZpdA&amp;qesig=x8JP9oD_NNAwFulC1e7wdQ&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tkKCrLJL-Gah6Ym1NST-Xj5fA-aJJc-_QUUbthyn6XdbIPD0sjwW1tdvo5rQeW1JhoYqiMazKArIzCXbvsu-uJ5WCPYzQ&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=ps&amp;fp=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;cad=b George Woods Affidavit], google.com; accessed October 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echols' lawyers claimed that his condition worsened during the trial, when he developed a "psychotic euphoria that caused him to believe he would evolve into a superior entity" and eventually be transported to a different world. His psychosis dominated his perceptions of everything going on in court, Woods wrote.&lt;ref name="The Commercial Appeal"/&gt; Echols's mental state while in prison awaiting trial was also called into question by his appellate team.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

====Retrial request====
While in prison, Echols wrote letters to Gloria Shettles, an investigator for his defense team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0712/19/lkl.01.html CNN Larry King Live-Damien Echols Death Row Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Echols sought to overturn his conviction based on trial error, including juror misconduct, as well as the results of a DNA Status Report filed on July 17, 2007, which concluded "none of the [[DNA|genetic material]] recovered at the scene of the crimes was attributable to Mr. Echols, Echols' co-defendant, Jason Baldwin, or defendant Jessie Misskelley .... Although most of the genetic material recovered from the scene was attributable to the victims of the offenses, some of it cannot be attributed to either the victims or the defendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wm3.org/live/newsevents/newsitem.php?index=1&amp;news_Id=131|title=DNA TESTING CONCLUDES|accessdate=2007-07-22|publisher=wm3.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823193448/http://www.wm3.org/live/newsevents/newsitem.php?index=1&amp;news_Id=131 |archivedate=August 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced DNA and other scientific evidence&amp;nbsp;– combined with additional evidence from several different witnesses and experts&amp;nbsp;– released in October 2007 had cast strong doubts on the original convictions. A hearing on Echols' petition for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] was held in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=41551  Echols' Attorneys File New Motion Claiming Wrongful Conviction In 'West Memphis Three' Case], American Chronicles, accessed October 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Release====
On August 19, 2011, Echols, along with Baldwin and Misskelley, entered an Alford plea, while asserting their innocence.&lt;ref name=ArOnline/&gt; The judge sentenced them to 18 years and 78 days, the amount of time they had served, and levied a suspended sentence of 10 years. Echols' sentence was reduced to three counts of [[first degree murder]]. Lawyers representing the West Memphis Three reached the plea deal that allowed the men to be released from prison. They were transferred to the hearing with their possessions. The plea deal did not technically result in a full exoneration; some of the convictions would stand, but the men would not admit guilt. The counsel representing the men said they would continue to pursue full exoneration.&lt;ref name=nyt_alford/&gt;

====Aftermath====
Echols relocated to [[Salem, Massachusetts]] with his wife and has no intentions of returning to Arkansas. In an interview with [[Piers Morgan]], he said that he would like to have a career in writing and [[visual arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piers Morgan – Damien Echols On The Death Penalty – 02/08/2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gv2cMLWykk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey''' was one of a group of American volunteer soldiers who went to the frontier territory of Texas in 1835 during the [[Texas Revolution]] against Mexico.  He was born in [[Virginia]] in 1806, the son of Moses Carey.  He was killed in 1836 at the [[Battle of the Alamo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Battle of the Alamo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carey was the first Texas commander at the [[Alamo]]. Ranked as Captain, he commanded an artillery company at his own expense, which was dubbed "The Invincibles".
