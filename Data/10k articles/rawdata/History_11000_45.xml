      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6220">'''Abu Bakr Muhammad bin Yahya al-Suli''' ({{lang-ar|أبو بكر محمد بن يحيى الصولي}},  880, [[Gorgan]]-946, [[Basra]]) was a nadim (boon companion) of successive [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]]s. He was noted for his poetry and scholarship and wrote a chronicle called ''Akhbar al-Radi wa'l-Muttaqi'', detailing the reigns of the caliphs [[al-Radi]] and [[al-Muttaqi]]. He was a legendary{{peacock-inline|date=July 2018}} player of [[shatranj]], a game ancestral to chess, and is still remembered to this day.

Upon the death of al-Radi in 940, al-Suli fell into disfavour with the new ruler due to his sympathies towards [[Shi'a Islam]] and as a result had to go into exile at [[Basra]], where he spent the rest of his life in poverty. Born into an illustrious family of Turkish origin, Al-Suli's great-grandfather was the [[Turkic people|Turkish]] prince [[Sul-takin]] and his uncle was the poet Ibrahim ibn al-'Abbas as-Suli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osaulai|first1=Muohammad Ibn Yaohyaa|title=The Life and Times of Abu Tammam|date=2015|publisher=Library of Arabic Literature|isbn=9780814760406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Akhbar al-Radi wa'l-Muttaqi''==

Al-Suli's chronicle has long been in the shadow of more famous chronicles such as those of [[al-Mas'udi]] and [[Miskawayh]], perhaps because al-Suli was seen as a nadim and not a serious scholar.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} However, the account is significant for offering an eyewitness account of the transition to [[Buyid]] rule. It was during al-Radi's caliphate in 936 that the position of ''[[amir al-umara]]'' was created, which allowed for the transfer of executive power from the caliph to an ''amir'', a position that the Buyids later used to establish a new dynasty alongside the Abbasids. After this point, the Abbasids never regained their full power. However, al-Suli's account makes it clear that not ''all'' power was transferred to the [[amir]]s.

==Chess==

Al-Suli came to prominence as a [[shatranj]] player sometime between 902 and 908 when he beat al-Mawardi, the court shatranj champion of [[al-Muktafi]], and the [[Caliph of Baghdad]]. Al-Mawardi was so thoroughly beaten that he fell from favour, and was replaced by al-Suli. After al-Muktafi's death, al-Suli remained in the favour of the succeeding ruler, [[al-Muqtadir]] and in turn [[ar-Radi]].

Al-Suli's shatranj-playing ability became well-known and he is still considered one of the best Arab players of all time. His biographer ben Khalliken, who died in 1282, said that even in his lifetime great shatranj players were said to play like al-Suli. Documentary evidence from his lifetime is limited, but the [[Chess endgame|endgames]] of some of the matches he played are still in existence. His skill in [[blindfold chess]] was also mentioned by contemporaries. Al-Suli also taught shatranj. His most well known pupil is [[al-Lajlaj]] ("the stammerer").

One of his most prominent achievements is his book, ''Kitab Ash-Shatranj'' (Book of Chess), which was the first scientific book written on [[chess strategy]]. It contained information on common [[chess opening]]s, standard problems in middle game, and annotated end games. It also contains the first known description of the [[knight's tour]] problem. Many later European writers{{who|date=July 2018}} based their work on modern chess on al-Suli's work. He also wrote several historical books.{{which|date=July 2018}}

al-Suli created a [[shatranj]] problem called "al-Suli's Diamond" that went unsolved for over a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
| last=Shenk | first=David
| title=The Immortal Game: A History of Chess}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As this is a shatranj, the "queen" (counsellor) is a very weak piece, able to move only a single square diagonally. It is possible to win in shatranj by capturing all pieces except the king, unless the opponent is able to do the same on the next move.

{{quote|This ancient position is so difficult that there is no one in the world who would be able to solve it, except those I have taught to do so. I doubt whether anyone did this before me. This was said by al-Suli.|12th-century manuscript from the library of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid]]&lt;ref name="Damsky"/&gt;}}

[[David Vincent Hooper|David Hooper]] and [[Ken Whyld]] studied this problem in the mid-1980s but were unable to crack it. It was finally solved by Russian [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Yuri Averbakh]].&lt;ref name="Damsky"&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6475">'''Al-Amīr al-Mukhtār ʿIzz al-Mulk Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Abiʾl Qāsim ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Aḥmad ibn Ismāʿīl ibn ʿAbd al-Azīz al-Ḥarranī al-Musabbiḥī al-Kātib''', commonly known simply as '''al-Musabbihi''' (4 March 977 – April/May 1030), was a [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] historian, writer and administrative official. He is known to have authored some 40,000 pages of manuscripts dealing with an array of topics, including history, psychology, law, grammar, sexology and cooking. ''Akhbār Miṣr'', a contemporary chronicle of Egyptian history and news, was among al-Musabbihi's well-known works. However, like the vast majority of al-Musabbihi's works, only fragments of ''Akhbār Miṣr'' survived; most of his writings disappeared not long after his death. 

Al-Musabbihi was a devout [[Sunni Muslim]] born in [[Fustat]], where he lived most of his life and died. He was known to be loyal to the Fatimid government and maintained particularly close ties with Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] (r. 996–1021). Early in his career, he served in the Fatimid military and was made a provincial governor in [[Upper Egypt]] before becoming a leading figure in the Fatimids' central administration in [[Cairo]].

==Life==
Al-Musabbihi was born a [[Sunni Muslim]] in [[Fustat]], [[Egypt]] on 4 March 977.&lt;ref name="Bianquis650"&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 650.&lt;/ref&gt; His family was originally from [[Harran]] in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] (al-Jazira).&lt;ref name="Bianquis650"/&gt; Not common for a locally-born Sunni civilian, al-Musabbihi joined the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] military. He was made governor of [[Minya, Egypt|al-Qays]] and [[Bahnasa]] (both in [[Upper Egypt]]) and held the title of ''amir'' (commander).&lt;ref name="Bianquis650"/&gt; He was later appointed head of the ''dīwān al-tartīb'', a position equivalent to general secretary of the central administration.&lt;ref name="Bianquis650-1"&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 650–651.&lt;/ref&gt;  He traveled daily from al-Fustat to his government post in [[Cairo]] and on most evenings, he stopped by the historic [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] and interacted with his and his father's friends, most of whom were Syrian Muslim traditionalists.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"&gt;Bianquis 1993, p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was a devout Sunni Muslim, al-Musabbihi was loyal to the Fatimids' [[Ismailism|Ismaili Shia]] state and maintained a particularly close relationship with the eccentric caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] (r. 996–1021).&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; The latter was known to get along with the residents of Fustat.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; Al-Musabbihi died in Fustat in April/May 1030.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt;

==Writings==
Al-Musabbihi was a prolific writer, who authored numerous manuscripts on a variety of subjects, including history, practical psychology, sexology, law, grammar and cooking.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; The later medieval historians [[Ibn Khallikan]] and Ibn Sa'id al-Andalusi documented in detailed lists all of al-Musabbihi's works and the amount of pages for each work; al-Musabbihi's total work amounted to roughly 40,000 pages, with some works alone consisting of over a thousand pages.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; However, most of his work disappeared not long after he died.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt;

===History of Egypt===
Among al-Musabbihi's main works was the roughly 13,000-page chronicle of Egypt's history, known as ''Akhbār Miṣr''.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; Like al-Musabbihi's other works, much of ''Akhbār Miṣr'' was lost early on, with exceptions including quotations of this work that were copied in other historians' compilations.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; The only known manuscript of ''Akhbār Miṣr'' that was preserved is chapter 40, which is located in the [[Escorial]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; This section of al-Musabbihi's work documented events occurring in the caliphate between 1023/24 and 1024/25 and also contained poems and letters by other writers who were well-acquainted with al-Musabbihi.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; According to [[Thierry Bianquis]], this manuscript "provides an insight into the contemporary literary composition, in elegant prose and poetry, of Egypt and Iraq at the beginning of the 11th century".&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; The modern Egyptian historian Ayman Fuad Sayyid claims the 15th-century Egyptian historian [[al-Maqrizi]] had in his possession chapter 34 of ''Akhbar Misr'', which recorded events for the year 1004/05.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; 

''Akhbar Misr'' was a contemporary work in which al-Musabbihi recorded the day-to-day events in the Fatimid Caliphate and at the end of the year, recorded the obituaries of notable individuals.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; As an administrative official in Cairo, he also documented the often violent struggle for power in the aftermath of al-Hakim's death, centered around various military commanders and civil officials, who utilized informers and forged documents to discredit each other in front of al-Hakim's child successor, [[Ali az-Zahir|az-Zahir]] (r. 1021–1036).&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; He held suspicions about the intrigues of [[Sitt al-Mulk]]'s entourage with az-Zahir.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; According to Bianquis, "it is possible that ideological control [following al-Hakim's death] was imposed on official historiography and that a certain number of texts, including the writings of al-Musabbihi, were spontaneously destroyed".&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; Al-Musabbihi also included news about the Bedouin uprising against the Fatimids in Syria in 1024/25 that placed the [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasids]] and [[Jarrahids]] in power there.&lt;ref name="Bianquis651"/&gt; Moreover, ''Akhbār Miṣr'' recorded regular aspects of life in Fustat, ranging from road accidents and crimes to wholesale and retail prices on goods amid a famine to hippopotami roaming in the [[Nile River]].&lt;ref&gt;Bianquis 1993, pp. 651–652.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alice Elizabeth Kober''' (December 23, 1906&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/research/pasp/Kober%20collection%20images/KoberGuggAppa.jpg Kober collection]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; May 16, 1950) was an American classicist best known for extensive investigations that eventually led to the decipherment of [[Linear B]].

The daughter of Hungarian immigrants, Kober was born in [[Yorkville, Manhattan|Yorkville]], a neighborhood on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]]. She attended [[Hunter College High School]], and in the summer of 1924, she placed third in a New York City scholarship contest.  The $100-a-year prize helped her to attend [[Hunter College]],&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; where she majored in Latin, was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and graduated [[magna cum laude]].&lt;ref&gt;Margalit Fox, ''The Riddle of the Labyrinth'', chapter four, location 1149 of the Kindle edition&lt;/ref&gt; She earned a master's degree in classics at [[Columbia University]] in 1929 and a PhD in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

While working on her doctorate, Kober taught at Hunter High and Hunter College and, in 1930, became an assistant professor of classics at [[Brooklyn College]], where she remained for the rest of her career.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  A former student, [[Eva Brann]], wrote that Kober was "aggressively nondescript....Her figure dumpy with sloping shoulders, her chin heavily determined, her hair styled for minimum maintenance, her eyes behind bottle-bottom glasses snapped impatiently and twinkled not unkindly."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Brann, "In Memoriam: Alice E. Kober," unpublished manuscript, University of Texas, Austin, quoted in Fox, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; On campus she shared an office with four other faculty members and served on standard committees.  After teaching herself [[Braille]], she also brailled textbooks, library materials, and final exams for blind students at Brooklyn College.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 109-100.&lt;/ref&gt; Kober lived with her widowed mother and, so far as is known, never had a romantic partner.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linear B==
Beginning in the 1930s, Kober privately studied Linear B, as yet an undeciphered script of an unidentified [[Aegean languages|Aegean]] language of the [[Bronze Age]], keeping massive statistics on 180,000 hand-cut cards and tabulations in forty notebooks.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 93, 104-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Kober used a hand punch to create a kind of "database, with the punched holes marking the parameters on which the data could be sorted."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; She also mastered a host of languages, ancient and modern, including Hittite, Old Irish, Akkadian, Tocharian, Sumerian, Old Persian, Basque and Chinese.  From 1942 to 1945, while teaching full-time in Brooklyn, she commuted weekly by train to Yale to take classes in advanced Sanskrit.  She also studied field archeology in New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Kober received a one-year [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to study Linear B full-time.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Making the acquaintance of [[John Linton Myres]], she gained access to many more Linear B inscriptions collected by the archaeologist of [[Knossos]], [[Sir Arthur Evans]], and hand copied most of them at [[Oxford University]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kober's major discovery was that Linear B was an [[inflected language]], difficult to write in a [[syllabic script]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further progress in deciphering the language was delayed by her renewed teaching duties and the thankless job of proofreading and correcting Myres's ''Scripta Minoa''.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; A chain smoker, Kober died, probably of cancer, in 1950 at the age of 43.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, 191.  A much younger cousin said that it was whispered in the family that she had died of a rare form of stomach cancer.&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, the architect [[Michael Ventris]] built on Kober's work and with some inspired guesses deciphered the script in 1952, establishing that it was [[Mycenaean Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gallafent|first=Alex|title=Alice Kober: Unsung heroine who helped decode Linear B|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22782620|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Archaeological Museum of Cherchell''' is an [[archaeological museum]] located in the center of the seaport town of [[Cherchell]] in [[Tipaza Province]], [[Algeria]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Félix-Jacques Moulin 064.jpg|thumb|Fragments found during archaeological surveys, circa 1856.]]
The Cherchell Museum houses what are widely considered to be some of the best examples of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[antiquities]] on the [[African continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algerian-tourism.com/algerian-tourism/index.php/fr/musees/cherchel-tipaza |title=Le musée de Cherchell Tipaza |accessdate=20 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117053212/http://algerian-tourism.com/algerian-tourism/index.php/fr/musees/cherchel-tipaza |archivedate=17 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherchell was called [[Caesarea of Mauretania]] during the [[Roman empire]], and was the rich capital of Roman [[Mauretania Caesariensis]]. Many artifacts from these various periods of Cherchell's former history have been uncovered by [[archaeologist]]s, a large number of which are on display in the Cherchell Archaeological Museum.

Exhibits include works by Byzantine [[silversmith]]s, such as ornately decorated [[patera]] (vessels used for drinking), as well as intricately designed [[mosaic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[:image:Cherchell museum - wall mosaic.jpg|Photograph of Cherchell Museum's wall mosaics]] (Wikimedia Commons)&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the Roman reign over [[Mauritania]] in 25 BC, under the leadership of [[Juba II]], that a theater, library and other buildings were established in Cherchell ([[Cherchell#Ancient history|Caesarea]]).

Juba II also gathered an impressive collection of artworks, particularly [[marble sculpture]]s, some of which have landed up in museums in other parts of the world, but excellent examples are to be found in Cherchell Museum, along with a sculpture of the head of his wife, [[Cleopatra Selene II]]. Partial ruins of the [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theater]], [[Roman baths]], and [[Basilica|Civile Basilica]] are found on the outskirts of Cherchell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algeria.com/museums/cherchell/ |title=Cherchell Museum: Home to Roman and Greek Antiquities|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his youth he wrote the radio feuilleton "Hilik Haviv" with his childhood friends and classmates [[Gad Yaacobi]] (later a government minister and member of the [[Knesset]]) and Micha Gisser (later professor of economics at the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]).

==His books==

===''Jews, Idumaeans and Ancient Arabs''===
His book deals with two major subjects: first, the [[Idumeans]] Judaizing, located in Idumea and the Yturs in the [[Galilee]] and their integrating in the Jewish society. The Judaizing action describe in the [[Hellenistic]] [[Historiography]] as an act of compulsion by the [[Hasmonean]], in order to abase their name. Kasher argues that the judaising conducted out of good will and cooperation of the nations who judaized with the Hasmonean. He examines the consequences of the Hellenistic influence in the Idumean society, and its implications on their relations with the neighbor Jewish nation, even though in the [[Bible]] the Idumean accused in co-operation with [[Babylon]] power and the ruin of [[Jerusalem]] and the temple in the year 586 BCE.
The second part of the book deals with the [[Nabataeans]] relations with the Jews from 332 BCE to 70 AD. The relations start with great friendship in the beginning of the Hashmonean period and ends in the [[Alexander Jannaeus]] wars and the Roman rule.
It is a pioneering monographic research, that was held in the first time by Aryeh Kasher. till his research historians used to study specially the Jewish People and the regime that conquer the country and hardly look for the non Jewish Israel country inhabitants. This because we hardly have national history papers of this nations authors, the archeological finding about them is scarse and the majority of the knowledge we have is from [[Josephus]], who describe them through their relations with the Jewish people.

===''Kenaan, Paleshet, Yavan ve-Yisrael''===
The book describes the history of the Jews relating to their relations with the Hellenistic cities in Israel country, in chronological order, during the period from the country conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] till the end of the big revolt against the Romans. The Jews saw the citizens of the Hellenistic cities as the heirs of [[Canaan]] and the [[Philistines]] from the Biblical period, whom the Hasmonean try to distinct, in the spirit of the Biblians saying. with all that accompany political, economical and cultural rival, that gather strength since the Hellenistic period.

===''King Herod: A Persecuted Persecutor''===
Pioneers research about [[Herod the Great]]. Psychological biography about in collaborate with the psychiatrist professor {{Interlanguage link multi|Eliezer Witztum|he|3=אליעזר ויצטום}}. The book stands as an antithesis to {{Interlanguage link multi|Avraham Shalit|he|3=אברהם שליט}}: ''Herod the Great: the man and his deed'', third edition, [[Bialik Institute]], 1964. In this book Shalit describe Herod as king that contribute a great deal to the Jewish People due to his monumental building enterprises. Kasher choose in his study to another aspect in Herod personality: his murderousness and interpret him as suffer from a [[paranoia|paranoid]] illness.
Kasher's research based on [[Josephus]]'s writing as a main source of knowledge. He was assisted by professor Witztum that using the psychological research tools in order to decipher the complex personality of Herod and diagnose his illness as [[inferiority complex]], a man that murder his closest relatives and anyone who he suspect by the least sign of treason, including his wife and three sons.
The manuscript of the book won the Bahat Prize given for distinguished reference books by the [[University of Haifa]] in 2006.

'''Boris Dmitrievich Grekov''' (21 April 1882 in [[Myrhorod]] &amp;ndash; 9 September 1953 in [[Moscow]]) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian noted for his comprehensive studies of [[Kievan Rus]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. He was a member of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] (1934) and several foreign academies, as well as Director of the Russian History Institute in Moscow.

Grekov entered [[Warsaw University]] in 1901 but moved to the [[Moscow University]] four years later. During the pre-revolutionary years he researched the economic and social history of the [[Novgorod Republic]] (published in 1914).

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]], Grekov participated in the [[White Movement]] in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], and in 1930, his son was arrested in connection with the "[[Sergey Platonov|Platonov Affair]]" and sent to the [[Solovki Islands Penal Colony]]. Both of these facts were widely known in the 1930s, and this led Grekov to make wide-ranging concessions to the official ideology during the [[Stalin Purges]] and, according to A. H. Plakhonin, to write scholarship "on order" for the regime.

At this time, he turned toward the study of [[Kievan Rus]] and became known as an opponent of the Ukrainian historian [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], who claimed the heritage of [[Kievan Rus]] primarily for modern [[Ukraine]]. His major work, [[Kievan Rus]] appeared in 1939 and was the first of three of his works to win the [[Stalin Prize]]. In this work, steeped in [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] and Stalinist ideology, he stressed the agricultural rather than commercial basis of the economy of this polity and argued that the heritage of Kievan Rus was equally shared by modern [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Belarus]].

Grekov's extensive research on Kievan Rus provided insights into the economic and cultural development of medieval [[Rus' people|Rus']] during the period of the [[Tatar]] domination. He summarized these findings in ''Culture of Kiev Rus'' (1944) and ''Russian Peasants from the Most Ancient Times to the Seventeenth Century'' (1946). But his most lasting work (and the one which is still regularly reprinted) was ''Golden Horde'', written in collaboration with [[Alexander Yakubovsky]] and first published in 1937. The second (and now classical) edition appeared in 1950 under the title ''Golden Horde and Its Downfall''.

Grekov also gave considerable attention to the collection and publication of primary sources, especially chronicles. His student, [[Vladimir Pashuto]], carried this work forward and began the collection of foreign sources for the medieval period in the history of the Eastern Slavs.

Doctor '''Frederik Carel Gerretson''' (born [[Kralingen]], 9 February 1884 – died [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], 27 October 1958) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer, essayist, historian, and politician.

==Early years==
Gerretson was educated in a public elementary school in [[Rotterdam]] before continuing his education there and in [[Amersfoort]]. He undertook officer training at the [[Koninklijke Militaire Academie]] in [[Breda]] before switching to academic study at the [[University of Utrecht]], the [[Solvay Institute of Sociology]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name="Dutch"&gt;[http://www.europa-nu.nl/id/vg09ll0zrq00/f_c_carel_gerretson Dr. F.C. (Carel) Gerretson - Hoofdinhoud]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Gerretson was a professor of colonial history at the [[University of Utrecht]]. He was particularly interested in the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonial experience]], especially in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. In this area he was involved in a noted academic dispute with the historian [[Annie Romein-Verschoor]] over the personality of [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]]. Being a [[Marxism|Marxist]], Romein-Verschoor characterized Coen as an imperialist. Gerretson, a staunch [[nationalism|nationalist]] and supporter of the empire, argued that Coen should be praised. Gerretson suggested that Coen was not widely appreciated because the Dutch people tend to avoid [[cult of personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Goor |first1=Jurrien|title=Prelude to Colonialism: the Dutch in Asia |year=2004 |publisher=Uitgeverij Verloren |location=[[Hilversum]] |isbn=9789065508065 |pages=71–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerretson also published books on a number of books on the [[petroleum industry]], with works such as ''Geschiedenis der "Koninklijke"'' and a history of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch]], before branching out into other areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/authors/OL126163A/Frederik_Carel_Gerretson Frederik Carel Gerretson] on [[Open Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerretson had been a secretary and board member at Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij, a predecessor of Royal Dutch, since 1917.&lt;ref name="Dutch"/&gt; He was awarded the prestigious [[Constantijn Huygens Prize]] in 1950 for his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn3/gerretson Carel Gerretson in the ''Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland'']&lt;/ref&gt; He had also written for a number of newspapers and journals including ''[[De Groene Amsterdammer]]'', ''Utrechts Provinciaal en Stedelijk Dagblad'', ''[[Leeuwarder Courant]]'', ''Het Vaderland'', ''[[Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant]]'', ''[[Algemeen Handelsblad]]'' and numerous others.&lt;ref name="Dutch"/&gt;

Using the [[pseudonym]] Geerten Gossaert, Gerretson also became noted as a poet with his work ''De moeder'' receiving regular reprints. He also published works under the name Arthur Lawick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schrijversinfo.nl/gossaertgeerten.html Geerten Gossaert]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Gerretson's nationalist principles led him to politics and he initially was associated with the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) before moving to the [[fascism|fascist]] politics of the [[National Union (Netherlands)|National Union]], of which he was one of the founders in 1925.  In 1933 he took the leadership of the 'Corporative Concentration', an attempt to unite the Netherlands' divided [[extreme right]] spearheaded by [[Alfred Haighton]], although Gerretson proved a divisive leader as he clashed frequently with [[Jan Baars]].  As a consequence Baars and his followers left the movement and the [[General Dutch Fascist League]], which was the main entity in the alliance, collapsed, allowing the initiative to pass to [[Nazism|Nazi]]-inclined elements such as the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] of [[Anton Mussert]] and [[Ernst Herman van Rappard]]'s [[National Socialist Dutch Workers Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', 1991, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerretson returned to the CHU and became a leading figure in the party at the head of a pro-colonial faction based in Utrecht. A strong voice on the right of the party, noted for his rhetoric, Gerretson would later become an isolated figure within the CHU.&lt;ref name="Dutch"/&gt; He was elected to the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] of the [[States-General of the Netherlands]] in 1951 for the CHU as a representative for [[South Holland]] and served in the first parliamentary commission for foreign policy, where he was in disagreement with the spirit of [[decolonisation]] that pervaded in the commission.&lt;ref name="Dutch"/&gt; Gerretson was a CHU candidate in the [[Dutch general election, 1956|1956 general election]] but lost his Senate seat.&lt;ref name="Dutch"/&gt; He was a policy adviser for the party from 1951 to 1955 and was also a regular contributor to the CHU organ ''De Nederlander''.&lt;ref name="Dutch"/&gt;

[[File:CarnaticRegion.jpg|thumb|Showing the Carnatic Region of what is now [[India]].]]
The '''Carnatic region''' is the region of peninsular [[South India]] lying between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Western Ghats]], in the modern [[India]]n states of [[Karnataka]],[[Tamil Nadu]] and southern [[Andhra Pradesh]].

==Etymology==
The name  'Carnatic' or 'Karnatic' is originally a Tamil word which means that 'Karai' (கரை) meaning 'shore' and 'nataka' (நாடக) meaning dance. Since the word 'Carnatic' or 'Karnataka' region and music or 'கரை நாடக சங்கீதம் (Tamil)' is the base of Kaveri-based regions during the chola periods (especially developed in the city of [[Puhar#City.27s destruction|Poompuhar]] (பூம்புகார் ), which was swallowed during a tsunami - remains still can be seen in Tamil Nadu with the same city name) to improve and to integrate Tamil based dance and music. So comes the name 'carnatic' or 'Karnatic' region / zone, as big landscape covering the whole gamut of kaveri based areas in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and some in Andhra Pradesh. This particular dialect has been introduced during the Chola time period as a proof of in 'Carnatic' or 'Karnatic' zone development. In a later stage, this was combined together with Sanskrit words. The music was patronized by [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar kings]].

Further to add, there are several theories as to the derivation of the term. It may derive from the [[Sanskrit]] language ''karņāţakam'' from ''karņa'' = "ear" + ''aţati'' = "he pleases" = "that which pleases the ear", thus "Karnāṭaka saṃgīta" = "[[Karnataka music]]", which was coined by [[Sarangadeva]].

According to Bishop [[Robert Caldwell]], in his ''Comparative Grammar of the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian Languages]]'', the term is derived from ''kar'', black, and ''nadu'', country, i.e. the black country, which refers to the black soil prevalent on the plateau of the Southern [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carnatic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hattangadi Narayan Rao suggests a derivation from ''karu'', elevated, + ''nadu'', land, "an elevated land", also descriptive of the region's geography.

The English "Carnatic" has been [[classical compound|classicalised]] in spelling.

==Geography==
The region is located in [[Southern India]], between the Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats and the [[Coromandel Coast]], in the [[Presidency of Madras]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Properly the name is, in fact, applicable only to the country of the Kanarese extending between the Eastern and [[Western Ghats]], over an irregular area narrowing northwards, from [[Palghat]] in the south to [[Gulbarga]], [[Bidar]] in the north, and including [[Mysore]]. The extension of the name to the country south of the Karnataka was probably due to the Muslim conquerors who in the 16th century overthrew the kingdom of [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]], and who extended the name, which they found used of the country north of the Ghats to that south of them. After this period the plain country of the south came to be as called ''Karnataka Payanghat'', or lowlands, as distinguished from ''Karnataka Balaghat'', or highlands. The misapplication of the name Carnatic was carried by the British a step further than by the Mahommedans, it being confined by them to the country below the Ghats, [[Mysore]] not being included. Officially, however, this name is no longer applied, the Carnatic having become a mere geographical term. Administratively, the name Carnatic (or rather Karnataka) is now applied only to the [[Bombay]] portion of the original Karnataka, viz, the districts of [[Belgaum]], [[Dharwar]] and [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]], part of '''Gulbarga district''', [[North Karnataka]], and the native states of the Southern Maharashtra agency and [[Kolhapur]].

===Sub-divisions===
The region generally known to [[European ethnic groups|European]]s as the Carnatic, though no longer a political or administrative division, is of great historical importance.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; It extended along the eastern coast about 600 kilometers in length, and from 50 to 100 kilometers in breadth. It was bounded on the north by the [[Guntur]] circar, and thence it stretched southward to [[Cape Comorin]]. It was divided into the Southern, Central and Northern Carnatic. The region south of the river [[Coleroon]], which passes the town of [[Trichinopoly]], was called the ''Southern Carnatic''. The principal towns of this division were [[Tanjore]], Trichinopoly, [[Madurai]], [[Tranquebar]], [[Negapatam]] and [[Tinnevelly]]. The ''Central Carnatic'' extended from the [[Coleroon]] river to the river [[Pennar]]; its chief towns being [[Madras]], [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], [[Arcot]], [[Vellore]], [[Cuddalore]], [[Pulicat]], [[Nellore]] and a few other towns. The ''Northern Carnatic'' extended from the river [[Pennar]] to the northern limit of the country; and the chief town was [[Ongole]]. The Carnatic, as above defined, comprehended within its limits the maritime provinces of Nellore, [[Chingleput]], [[South Arcot]], Tanjore, [[Madura]] and Tinnevelly, besides the inland districts of [[North Arcot]] and Trichinopoly. The population of this region consists chiefly of Brahmanical Hindus. Mahommedans are thinly scattered over the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==History==
At the earliest period of which any records exist, the area now known as the Carnatic was divided between the [[Pandya]] and [[Chola]] kingdoms, which with that of [[Chera dynasty]] or [[Kerala]] formed the three Tamil kingdoms of southern India.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The [[Pandya kingdom]] practically coincided in extent with the districts of Madura and Tinnevelly; that of the Cholas extended along the [[Coromandel coast]] from Nellore to [[Pudukottai]], being bounded on the north by the Pennar River ([[Penner River]]) and on the south by the Southern Vellaru.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The government of the area was shared for centuries with these dynasties by numerous independent or semi-independent chiefs, evidence of whose perennial internecine conflicts is preserved in the multitudes of forts and fortresses, the deserted ruins of which crown almost all the elevated points. In spite, however, of this passion of the military classes for war, the Tamil civilization developed in the country was of a high type.{{citation needed|reason=what, exactly, is "high"?|date=November 2014}} This was largely due to the wealth of the country, famous in the earliest times as now for its pearl fisheries. Of this fishery Korkai (the Greek KhXxot), now a village on the Tambraparni River in Tinnevelly, but once the Pandya capital, was the centre long before the Christian era.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s day, owing to the silting up of the harbour, its glory had already decayed and the Pandya capital had been removed to Madura,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny Hist. Nat. vi. cap. XXiii. 26&lt;/ref&gt; famous later as a centre of Tamil literature. The Chola kingdom, which four centuries before Christ had been recognized as independent by the Maurya king [[Ashoka]], had for its chief port Kaviripaddinam at the mouth of the Kauvery, every vestige of which is now buried in sand.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

For the first two centuries after Christ, a large sea-borne trade was carried on between the [[Roman empire]] and the Tamil kingdoms; but after Caracalla's massacre at [[Alexandria]] in A.D. 215, this ceased, and with it all intercourse with Europe for centuries also. Henceforward, until the 9th century, the history of the country is illustrated only by occasional and broken lights.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The 4th century saw the rise of the [[Pallava]] power, which for some 400 years encroached on, without extinguishing, the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] kingdoms. When in A.D. 640 the Chinese traveller Hsuan Tsang visited [[Kanchi]] (Conjevaram), the capital of the [[Pallava]] king, he learned that the kingdom of Chola (Chu-li-ya) embraced but a small territory, wild, and inhabited by a scanty and fierce population; in the [[Pandya kingdom]] (Malakuta), which was under Pallava suzerainty, literature was dead, Buddhism all but extinct, while Hinduism and the naked Jain saints divided the religious allegiance of the people, and the pearl fisheries continued to flourish.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The power of the Pallava kings was shaken by the victory of Vikramaditya Chalukya in AD 740, and shattered by Aditya Chola at the close of the 9th century. From this time onward, the inscriptional records are abundant. The [[Chola Dynasty]], which in the 9th century had been weak, now revived, its power culminating in the victories of Rajaraja the Great, who defeated the [[Chalukyas]] after a four years war, and, about AD 994, forced the Pandya kings to become his tributaries. A magnificent temple at Tanjore, once his capital, preserves the records of his victories engraved upon its walls. His career of conquest was continued by his son Rajendra Choladeva I, self-styled Gangaikonda owing to his victorious advance to the Ganges, who succeeded to the throne in AD 1018. The ruins of the new capital which he built, called Gangaikonda Cholapuram, still stand in a desolate region of the Trichinopoly district. His successors continued the eternal wars with the Chalukyas and other dynasties, and the Chola power continued in the ascendant until the death of Kulottunga Chola III in 1278, when a disputed succession caused its downfall and gave the Pandyas the opportunity of gaining for a few years the upper hand in the south.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1310, however, the [[Mahommedan]] invasion under Malik Kafur overwhelmed the Hindu states of southern India in a common ruin. Though crushed, however, they were not extinguished; a period of anarchy followed, the struggle between the Chola kings and the [[Musulman|Mussulmans]] issuing in the establishment at [[Kanchi]] of a usurping Hindu dynasty which ruled till the end of the 14th century, while in 1365 a branch of the Pandyas succeeded in re-establishing itself in part of the kingdom of Madura, where it survived till 1623.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

At the beginning of the 15th century, the whole country had come under the rule of the kings of Vijayanagar; but in the anarchy that followed the overthrow of the Vijayanagar empire by the Mussulmans in the 16th century, the Hindu viceroys (nayakkas) established in Madura, Tanjore and [[Kanchi]] made themselves independent, only in their turn to become tributary to the kings of [[Golconda]] and [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], who divided the Carnatic between them.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Muslim era===
Towards the close of the 17th century, the country was reduced by the armies of [[Aurangzeb]], who in 1692 appointed [[Zulfikar Ali]], [[Nawab of the Carnatic]], with his seat at [[Arcot]].Meanwhile, the Marathas power had begun to develop; in 1677 [[Shivaji]] had suppressed the last remnants of the Vijayanagar power in [[Vellore]], [[Gingee]] and [[Kurnool]], while his brother [[Venkoji]], who in 1674 had overthrown the [[Nayaks of Tanjavur]], established in that city a dynasty which lasted for a century. The collapse of the Delhi power after the death of [[Aurangzeb]] produced further changes. The Nawab [[Muhammed Saadatullah Khan I|Saadet-Allah]] of Arcot (1710–1732) established his independence; his successor [[Dost Ali]] (1732–1740) conquered and annexed Madura in 1736, and his successors were confirmed in their position as Nawabs of the Carnatic by the Nizam of Hyderabad after that potentate had established his power in southern India. After the death of Nawab [[Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan|Mahommed Anwar-ud-din]] (1744–1749), the succession was disputed between [[Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah|Mahommed Ali]] and [[Husein Dost]]. In this quarrel, the French and English, then competing for influence in the Carnatic, took opposite sides. The victory of the British established [[Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah|Mahommed Ali]] in power over part of the Carnatic till his death in 1795. Meanwhile, however, the country had been exposed to other troubles. In 1741 [[Madura]], which the Nawab [[Dost Ali]] (1732–1740) had added to his dominions in 1736 after the demise of the [[Nayaks of Madurai]], was conquered by the marathas; and in 1743 [[Hyder Ali]] of Mysore overran and ravaged the central Carnatic.The latter was re-conquered by the British, to whom [[Madura]] had fallen in 1758; and, finally, in 1801 all the possessions of the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]] were transferred to them by a treaty which stipulated that an annual revenue of several lakhs of pagodas should be reserved to the nawab, and that the British should undertake to support a sufficient civil and military force for the protection of the country and the collection of the revenue. On the death of the nawab in 1853, it was determined to put an end to the nominal sovereignty, a liberal establishment being provided for the family.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The Carnatic region, when first entered into by the British, was ruled by military chieftains called [[Poligar]]s. In 1805, after the decisive defeat of the Poligars, the Poligar forts and military establishments were destroyed.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Carnatic region was place of [[Carnatic Wars]] between Mughan Empire, Britain and France which were ultimately led to British victory and the domination of [[British Empire]] over India.

A former [[convent]] girl from Newry, Maguire joined the IRA and, according to ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, was trained by [[Dessie Grew]]. In early 1989 she travelled to Europe as part of an IRA [[active service unit]] based in [[The Hague]] and [[Hanover]].&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; On 12 July 1989 Maguire and Leonard Hardy were arrested at [[Rosslare Europort|Rosslare]], [[County Wexford]] after arriving on a ferry from [[Cherbourg]], and [[mercury switch]]es, explosives and photographs of [[British Army]] bases in Germany were seized. At their trial at the [[Special Criminal Court]] in [[Dublin]] in February 1990 Maguire was acquitted of possession of explosives, but Hardy was sentenced to five years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; German authorities had requested Maguire's [[extradition]] in relation to a bombing at a [[British Army]] barracks at [[Osnabrück]] on 19 June 1989 and the killing of a British soldier in a car bomb attack in Hanover several days later, but she was not re-arrested when she left court and she immediately returned to Europe.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt;

Maguire was arrested in Belgium near the border with the [[Netherlands]] on 16 June 1990, after a farmer reported hearing gunshots in woods and two [[handguns]], a [[machine gun]] and explosives were found nearby.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Belgians and Dutch Seize 2 Suspected of I.R.A.

Due to the length of time spent in custody on remand—during the trial Maguire became the longest-serving remand prisoner in German legal history—Maguire walked free from court.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt;

On 17 January 1996 Maguire received £13,500 compensation due to a 1985 accident in Newry, when she tripped due to a broken paving stone. She told the court "I have had to give up dancing, jogging and swimming because the ankle swells up. I can't wear high heels and the ankle is not very stable when I walk on rough ground or gravel".&lt;ref name="ind2"&gt;{{cite web | title = Maguire faces appeal over £13,500 award | author = [[David McKittrick]] | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/maguire-faces-appeal-over-pounds-13500-award-1324492.html | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' | date = 18 January 1996 | accessdate = 2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compensation award was described as a disgrace by [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MP [[Ken Maginnis]], and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[David Wilshire]] said it was shocking and obscene and called for the law to be changed. Colin Parry, who received £7,500 after the death of his 12-year-old son in the [[Warrington bomb attacks]], called for a review of the compensation system saying "It's a kick in the teeth. Every time these judgments come along, it reminds us how little society appears to value a child's life".&lt;ref name="ind2"/&gt;

The [[nationalist]] movement among the [[Kurds|Kurdish people]] first emerged in the late 19th century with an uprising in 1880 led by [[Sheik Ubeydullah]]. Many Kurds worked with other opponents of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] regime within the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP). A growth in ethnic consciousness at the start of the 20th century was spearheaded by the [[Kürdistan Teali Cemiyeti|Society for the Advancement of Kurdistan]] (SAK). Some Kurdish nationalist groups agitated for [[secession]], others for [[autonomy]].

During the [[First World War]], while some Kurdish nationalists were working with the British and Russian enemy powers, Kurdish tribal forces were fighting alongside Ottoman troops on the Russian front. Deaths and displacements occurred on a large scale among Kurdish civilians due to wartime conditions and deliberate ethnic cleansing policies.

There was a brief opportunity for Kurdish nationalism after World War I with the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]].  Western powers (particularly the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]) promised the Kurds they would act as guarantors for Kurdish freedom, a promise they subsequently broke. Some of the autonomist Kurdish groups received British support leading up to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920), which prepared for local autonomy for the Kurdish regions and envisaged later independence. Opposition from [[Kemal Atatürk]], leader of the new nation-state of [[Turkey]], and changes in British policy, prevented such a result. Following the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] the Kurdish territory was partitioned between Turkey, the French mandate of [[Syria]], the British mandate of [[Iraq]], and [[Persia]].

==Prior to 1914==
The nationalist movement among the Kurds first emerged in the late 19th century with an uprising led by a Kurdish landowner and head of the powerful [[Şemdinli|Şemdinan]] family, [[Sheik Ubeydullah]]. In 1880, Ubeydullah demanded political autonomy or outright independence for Kurds and the recognition of a [[Kurdistan]] state separate from both the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ozoglu, Hakan. Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries. Feb 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-5993-5}}. Pg 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising was suppressed by the Ottomans.

The first Kurds to challenge the authority of the Ottoman Empire did so primarily as Ottoman subjects, rather than Kurds. They worked with other [[Turkish people|Turks]] and Ottoman subjects who were in opposition to the policies of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdul Hamid]] and in 1889 formed the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP). Abdul Hamid responded with a policy of repression, but also of integration, co-opting prominent Kurdish opponents into the Ottoman power structure with prestigious positions in his government. This strategy appears successful given the loyalty displayed by the Kurdish [[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]] regiments during World War I.&lt;ref name="laciner"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Ideological And Historical Roots Of Kurdist Movements In Turkey: Ethnicity Demography, Politics|journal=Nationalism and Ethnic Politics|first=Bal|last=Laçiner|author2=Bal, Ihsan|volume=10|issue=3|pages=473–504|doi=10.1080/13537110490518282|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/articles.php?id=15|format=|accessdate=19 October 2007|date=2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011225529/http://www.turkishweekly.net/articles.php?id=15|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decade of the 20th century, Kurdish nationalism was still an ambiguous, controversial, or unfamiliar concept for many Kurds. Educated Kurds, primarily from [[Istanbul]], sought a political solution largely within the confines of the Ottoman Empire and one that did not rest solely on an ethnic basis. That kind of identity was related with a more tribal consciousness; one that lacked sophistication for many. Others had much to lose if the status quo was altered. For many, this stemmed from a religious concern, where the Sultan had long brought Muslims under a secure [[Caliphate]]. Others, particularly tribal chieftains, had economic concerns. Still other Kurds, especially those outside of [[Anatolia]], lacked understanding of nationalism or were simply unaware and unaffected.&lt;ref name=McDowall&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowall|first=David|title=A Modern History of the Kurds|year=1996|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=1850436533|pages=131–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization known as the [[Kürdistan Teali Cemiyeti]] (Society for the Advancement of Kurdistan, or SAK) was central to the forging of a distinct Kurdish identity. It took advantage of the period of political liberalization during the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] (1908–1920) of Turkey to transform a renewed interest in [[Kurdish culture]] and language into a political nationalist movement based on [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=natali/&gt; The emphasis on the Kurdish people as a distinct ethnic group was encouraged around the start of the 20th century by [[Russia]]n [[anthropologist]]s who suggested that the Kurds were a [[Europe]]an race (compared to the [[Asia]]tic Turks), based on physical characteristics and their language which is part of the Indo-European language group.&lt;ref name=laciner/&gt; Based more on this ethno-nationalistic standpoint, two prominent Kurdish families, the Badr Khans and the Sayyids, renewed opposition to the empire. These clans founded the first two strains of Kurdish nationalism. The Badr Khans were [[secession]]ists while the Sayyids of Nihiri were [[Autonomy|autonomists]].&lt;ref name="McDowall b"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowall|first=David|title=A Modern History of the Kurds|year=1996|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=1850436533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating within the autonomist framework, Shaykh Abd al Qadir in 1910 appealed to the Committee on Union and Progress (which, after the 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]], now held the power of the government after deposing Sultan Abd al Hamid) for an autonomous Kurdish state in the east. That same year, [[Said Nursi]] traveled through the [[Diyarbakir]] region and urged Kurds to unite and forget their differences, while still carefully claiming loyalty to the CUP. Other Kurdish [[Shaykh]]s in the region began leaning towards regional autonomy.

During this time, the Badr Khans had been in contact with discontented Shaykhs and chieftains in the far east of Anatolia ranging to the Iranian border, more in the framework of secession, however. Shaykh Abd al Razzaq Badr Khan eventually formed an alliance with Shaykh Taha and Shaykh Abd al Salam Barzani, another powerful family in Kurdistan. Because of this possible Kurdish threat as well as the alliance's dealings with Russia, Ottoman troops moved against this alliance in 1914. Two brief and minor rebellions, the rebellions of [[Barzan, Iraq|Barzan]] and [[Bitlis]], were quickly suppressed.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

The problem for these early Kurdish rebels was one of coordination. The British vice-consul in Bitlis reported that "Could the Kurds combine against the government even in one province, the Turkish troops in their eastern part of Asia Minor would find it difficult to crush the revolt." (p.&amp;nbsp;101) &lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

==The First World War==
[[File:Kurdish Cavalry in the Caucasus Mountains. The New York Times, January 24, 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Kurdish Cavalry in the passes of the Caucasus mountains (''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 1915).]]
The outbreak of [[World War I]] was a powerful check to growing Kurdish nationalism. However, some Kurds continued to work behind the scenes for an independent Kurdistan. These represent some of the first attempts by Kurds to work with foreign powers against Turks for their autonomy. In 1914, General Muhammad Sharif Pasha offered his services to the British in Mesopotamia. Elsewhere, members of the Badr Khan family held close relations with Russian officials and discussed their intentions to form an independent Kurdistan.&lt;ref name=Jwaideh&gt;{{cite book|last=Jwaideh|first=Wadie|title=The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development|year=2006|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse|isbn=081563093X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the conflict between Kurds and [[Armenians]] in the east raged. Kurds were threatened with punishment by Ottoman authorities if they did not obey orders to evict or kill the Armenians. In rare instances, Kurds spared their Christian victims and protected them because they were neighbors with whom they had held cordial relations.  It is difficult to accept that the struggle was a purely ethnic one. The Armenians, it was reasoned, presented a real threat for many Kurds, especially the farther one went east. Armenians, after all, had relationships with the hostile European powers and Russia. According to David McDowall, "most Kurds involved in the massacres probably felt it was a question of 'them or us'". (p.&amp;nbsp;105) &lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

Kurds contributed significantly to the Ottoman Empire's war effort. Tribal forces served against the Russian army in [[Persia]] and Turkey. Kurdish battle casualties are estimated at 300,000. However, the effect of the war on the Kurdish populated areas was more severe. Many regions throughout Kurdistan were laid waste and their populations decimated by advancing and retreating troop forces. Furthermore, as the war continued, the [[Young Turks]] implemented large scale [[ethnic cleansing]] of both [[Armenian people|Armenians]] and Kurds, including the deportation of Kurds from [[Erzurum]] and [[Bitlis]] in the winter of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, R. The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East, p.322. Vintage. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-7517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of World War I, up to 700,000 Kurds had been forcibly deported and almost half of the displaced perished.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dominik J. Schaller, Jürgen Zimmerer, ''Late Ottoman genocides: the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and Young Turkish population and extermination policies—introduction'', Journal of Genocide Research, Vol.10, No.1, p.8, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, at this time the Ottoman Kurds still had the legal right to conduct their affairs in Kurdish, celebrate unique traditions, and identify themselves as a distinct ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Natali|2005|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The end of the Ottoman Empire==

The Kurdish ethnonationalist movement that emerged following World War I and the [[Defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922)|end of the Ottoman Empire]] was largely in reaction to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily radical [[secularization]] which the strongly [[Muslim]] Kurds abhorred, centralization of authority which threatened the power of local chieftains and Kurdish autonomy, and rampant [[Turkish nationalism]] in the new Turkish Republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them.&lt;ref name="natali"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ottoman Kurds and emergent Kurdish nationalism|journal=Critique: Critical Middle Eastern Studies|first=Denise|last=Natali|volume=13|issue=3|pages=383–387|doi=10.1080/1066992042000300701|url=|format=|date=2004}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 October 2007--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the prominent Kurdish nationalist [[Şerif Pasha]] pressed the British to adopt a policy supporting autonomous Kurdish regions throughout Kurdistan. He suggested that British officials be charged with appointing officials to administer the regions and control their finances. Strategically, he desired movement towards this plan to be made before the end of the war and the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Şerif was not able to convince the British of this. However, his efforts to plead the cause of his people leading up to the Peace Conference impressed Western powers. Because of his friendship with Armenians, after he was chosen to represent the Kurds by various Kurdish nationalist organizations at the Peace Conference, a Kurdo-Armenian peace accord was reached between Şerif and Armenian representatives at the conference in 1919. The British persuaded the Kurdish and Armenian representatives to sign this Kurdish-Armenian declaration of solidarity against the [[Kemalist]]s for strategic reasons. The British thought this would increase the likelihood of independent Kurdish and Armenian states that would create a buffer between British [[Mesopotamia]] and the Turks.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

The first opportunity for the Kurds to establish an independent state came with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the end of the First World War. In his [[Fourteen Points]] Programme for World Peace, US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] included the statement that non-Turkish minorities of the Ottoman Empire should be "assured of an absolute unmolested opportunity of autonomous development". Aside from the supporters of such sentiments in the US, Britain, France, and of course of Kurds, there were other aspects to consider. These included the operational breakup of the Ottoman Empire, the Kemalist movement, Russia's territorial ambitions, the status of the Christian Armenian population, and Britain's desire to preserve stability in and around its colonial possessions.&lt;ref name="Yildiz 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yildiz|first=Kerim|title=The Kurds in Iraq: Past, Present, and Future|year=2007 |publisher=Pluto, The Kurdish Human Rights Project|location=London|isbn=0745326633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anatolia===

Turkish forces often broke the terms of the Armistice by arming Kurdish forces in eastern Anatolia. Turkish forces were able to stir up religious resentment among Kurds against Christian Armenians in a desire to create an effective Kurdish buffer between Turkey and a possible Armenian state, or obviate its creation altogether. Much of this groundwork was performed by 'Ali Ihsan Pasha.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

Elsewhere, anti-British sentiment was developed by 'Ali Beg and his Turco-Kurdish independence party, and the Kurdish Club, which [[Edward William Charles Noel]] claimed was plagued with corruption and self-seeking individuals who were also members of the Turkish CUP.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

Following the [[Treaty of Mudros]], Istanbul's Kurds began resurrecting their nationalist groups. By the end of 1918, Shaykh Abd al Qadir of the Badr Khans and others reconstituted the [[Kurdish Club]] under the new title of [[The Society for the Rise of Kurdistan]]. But to many, including the British, it was unclear exactly who and what the Kurdish Club and its affiliates in the provinces represented.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

Understanding the threat that these renewed Kurdish clubs represented if allied with the British (who had by now made it clear that they were leaning towards providing an autonomous Kurdish state), the CUP began advocating policies of decentralization and penetrated these Kurdish clubs in order to maintain their loyalty. Furthermore, Kurdish nationalism was then tactically supported in eastern regions. While inspiring [[Sunni]] solidarity among the Kurds, they worked to foment anti-British sentiment among the Kurds.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

By 1919, two developments destroyed Kurdish hopes of achieving either autonomy or independence in eastern Anatolia. The Greeks landed at [[Smyrna]] and the Italians invaded further south in [[Antalya]]. The psychological effect that these foreign, Christian invasions had on the Muslim Kurdish population was significant and inevitable. Ideas of nationalism were instantly eclipsed by the Christian threat and the Ottoman government easily mobilized Kurds under Pan-Islamic unity. The second disaster was the rise of [[Mustafa Kemal]]. He militantly voiced concern for the safety of the sultanate and called for the preservation of eastern Anatolia against the Christian threat. This likewise had a similar effect on Kurds. Kemalist power grew throughout 1919. With this growth, came persecution of the Kurds and the narrowing of Kurdish political space. A new Kurdish political party was refused registration. Newspapers related calls for Kurdish independence with that of supporting Armenian nationalism as well. Outspoken Kurds were imprisoned or executed for treasonous statements. In 1920, the National Pact was signed.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

===Treaty of Sèvres===
[[File:SevresSignatories.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The signatories of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], 1920]]
Leading up to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], in addition to the inability of Kurds to produce a credible leadership, a big failure in reaching a better understanding of an autonomous Kurdish state was due simply to the amount of time that passed between Mudros in 1918 and Sèvres in 1920. Kurds were provided with little alternative by the British. After the Greek attempts in Anatolia, the rise of the Kemalists, and a growing perceived Armenian threat, Anatolian Kurds lacked nationalistic, secessionist desires.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

[[File:Kurdistan1920.png|thumb|right|250px|Provisions of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] for an independent [[Kurdistan]], 1920.]]
The Treaty was signed between the Allied powers and the government in Istanbul, despite the growing power and authority of the government and the authority of the Grand National Assembly in Ankara. The government in Istanbul was compelled to sign the Treaty even though they themselves strongly disapproved of the terms.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

In the eyes of the Kurds, the treaty had its flaws. The treaty excluded the Kurdish territories in [[Syria]], the part of the [[Dersim]] region lying west of the [[Euphrates]], and the failure to demarcate a boundary between the Kurds and the Armenians. However, these flaws were minor and dominated by "the fundamental fact that the treaty had been forced upon an unwilling and token government that lacked a constituency even in Istanbul." (p.&amp;nbsp;137)&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

Section III of the treaty includes all information related to the issue of an autonomous state of Kurdistan in articles 62 – 64. Under article 62, British, French, and Italian officials were assigned to draft within six months of the implementation of the treaty "a scheme of local autonomy for the predominantly Kurdish areas".&lt;ref name="The Treaty of Sevres, 1920"&gt;The Treaty of Sèvres, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; Article 64 explicitly states that Kurdish regions have the right to proclaim independence from Turkey or other regions ruled over by the Principal Allied Powers in any part of Kurdistan.&lt;ref name="The Treaty of Sevres, 1920"/&gt;

The Treaty of Sèvres was signed on August 10, 1920. Supporters of the Kurdish military leader Colonel Halid Beg Cibran and other Kurdish nationalists began advocating against the Kemalists and Turkish nationalist sentiments in fear that those sentiments would betray their own interests in an independent Kurdistan. Halid Beg Cibran traveled throughout parts of eastern Anatolia garnering support for his cause, at times using violent coercion against non-supportive Kurdish [[Alevi]] tribes.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Robert|title=The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880-1925|year=1989|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=0292776195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Koçgiri rebellion===
Elsewhere, the Koçgiri rebellion fully erupted in the Dersim region in November 1920. During this time, the Kemalist government in Ankara was attempting to influence Kurds to join the Turkish nationalistic cause by offering jobs and bribes. Throughout 1920, Kurdish organizers in the Dersim region were increasingly successful in tribal organization for an autonomous Kurdistan against the Kemalists, even though many in the region supported the Kemalists. During the summer months, Kurdish armed forces in the region began attacking Turkish ammunition sites and police stations. By November, three months after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, Kurds were demanding official recognition for their autonomy. However, winter stifled their ability to organize and armed operations ceased. During this time, Kemalists were able to surround the region and co-opt many Kurdish tribal leaders and bring them into the Kemalist camp.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

Clashes erupted again as early as January 1921. With their new position of advantage, Turkish Kemalists arrested and deported Kurdish nationalists and demanded the unconditional surrender of the Kurdish forces that they met, threatening the destruction of their villages if they did not cooperate. Yet, Kurdish forces won several important battles and gained important footholds in the region by March. These successes prompted an increased response from Ankara. By April, the Kurdish rebellion was decisively put down. Reasons behind the Koçgiri rebellion were both ideological and strategic. The main reason for Kurdish support for the rebellion was in order to implement articles 62-64 of the Treaty of Sèvres and increase their autonomy in Kurdish Anatolia. Strategically, Kurdish organizers and forces in the region thought they could take advantage of the fledgling Kemalist government as well as its preoccupation with the Greek conflict in the west. The Kurds severely miscalculated in this last respect. There is also evidence that they anticipated foreign support from the French, British, or Greeks. But there is no evidence that they received any. Some Kurdish forces disagreed with requesting foreign support against the Turks as well.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

There are four main reasons that the Koçgiri rebellion failed. Firstly, the Kurds received no outside European support. Secondly, the tribal nature of Kurdish society allowed the Kemalists to co-opt tribes and break up the unity of the movement. Thirdly, there were religious and sectarian differences among Kurds (primarily Sunni and Alevi differences) that created mistrust and a weak unity. Lastly, the Turks' military, organizational, and patronage power was overwhelmingly superior. It should also be noted that it is unlikely that any of the tribes involved in the revolt had battle experience in World War I. Most of the Kurdish Hamidiye regiments that fought in the Balkans under the Ottoman flag lived further east and south. The Kocgiri rebellion was also located near Ankara was relatively accessible by Turkish forces.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

The Koçgiri rebellion had a significant impact on the government of Ankara. The government continued its policy of attempting to win over Kurdish tribal leaders but set up special commissions to investigate the rebellion. A draft law came before the Grand National Assembly in February 1922 that dealt with administering the Kurdish regions. Because of its superficial nature in dealing with Kurdish autonomy, most Kurdish deputies in the Grand National Assembly opposed it. In his analysis of the draft law, Rober Olson claims that Kurdish opposition to the law reveals that these Kurdish Kemalists were hopeful of obtaining greater autonomy for the Kurds. He also claims that the draft law and its overwhelming majority support reveals that at the time Turks in the Assembly did not favor a violent policy towards the Kurds, but that they "did not remotely consider independence or even autonomy in any meaningful sense of that term" for the Kurds (p.&amp;nbsp;41).&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

===Iraq===
[[File:A Jaf chief, S. Kurdistan.jpg|thumb|left|A Kurdish [[Jaff (Kurdish tribe)|Jaff]] tribal chief, [[Mesopotamia]], 1914]]
First direct contact with Kurds in [[Iraq]] and British was in 1917 after the British occupied [[Khanaqin]] and later other regions in the north of present Iraq, including [[Kifri]], [[Tuz Khurmatu]], and [[Kirkuk]]. In 1918, the first Kurdish troops to fight against the Turks were employed by the British. After further British success in the region, Kurdish tribal leaders were impressed and sought to cast their support behind the British effort. Kurdish notables, including Shaykh Mahmud, agreed that they would further seek support from the British for an autonomous state under the British occupied territory.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

The Kurdish enthusiasm was not matched by the British. They began withdrawing from Kirkuk and the surrounding regions in May 1918. These areas were promptly reoccupied by Turkish forces. This reoccupation by Turkish forces resulted in much retribution for the Kurds in the region. The British withdrawal was a severe blow to British prestige and ridiculed Kurdish leaders who had spoken in support of the British. Kurds would remain suspicious and doubtful of British power and their intention years after World War I ended.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

Indeed, Turkish propaganda against the British was not limited to just Eastern Anatolia and Persia. They had a strong presence in the [[Mosul]] ''wilayat'' of south Kurdistan. In '[[Amadiya]], Kurds were more easily influenced against the British because the British were a new, foreign presence in their land. Many Kurdish chieftains in the region, far from Istanbul, preferred the old scheme of things under the Ottomans, where they had enjoyed semi-autonomy. New administrative measures under the British, including the collection of taxes and the repatriation of Assyrian refugees agitated the 'Amadiya Kurds. After this agitation and pressure by Turkish inciters, Kurds in the region revolted against the British. This revolt was summarily put down, however, by 1919. Minor revolts of this kind broke out sporadically over the coming years in the Mosul region.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

===Syria===

During the conflict between Kemalists and the Kurds and the Turkish war of independence in the 1920s many Kurds fled to Syria from Turkey to escape oppression. These refugees settled mainly in the [[Al-Jazira province|Jazira]] region of northern Syria where formerly nomadic Kurds had already settled decades earlier and become agriculturalists. Unified Kurdish political activity in Syria was relatively undeveloped and sparse. During the [[Turkish war of independence]], Kurdish tribes in Jazira assisted French forces in repelling Turkish advances. The French at this time had considered the creation of a Kurdish enclave stretching from [[Urfa]] in the west to [[Cizre]] in the east.&lt;ref name=Yildiz&gt;{{cite book|last=Yildiz|first=Kerim|title=The Kurds in Syria|year=2005|publisher=Pluto Press, The Kurdish Human Rights Project|location=London|isbn=0745324991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French policies of decentralization benefited many Kurds in this region at the time because of the increased local power they were given. However, Kurds in Syria were not unified in this position. Many wealthy Kurds in Damascus supported the central authority and status quo under the Ottoman Turks and were not supportive of French decentralization. Other Kurdish tribes supported Syrian independence from the French alongside Arab tribes. This diversity in opinion regarding Kurdish autonomy and relations with the French "hindered the development of Kurdish nationalist political activity in Syria." (p.&amp;nbsp;28).&lt;ref name="Yildiz"/&gt;

==British policy==
British policy towards the Kurds changed several times between the years of 1918 and 1923, the years between the Armistice of Mudros and the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]]. The common historical argument is that the abrogation of the Treaty of Sèvres was a result of the success of Kemalist forces and militant Turkish nationalism. However, the evolution of British policy towards the Kurds eventually ran counter to the implementation of articles 62-64 of the Treaty of Sèvres.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

After the armistice of Mudros and until the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres in August 1920, British policy toward the Kurds was that of supporting autonomous units throughout Kurdistan. Kurdish nationalism and autonomy throughout Kurdish populated regions was supported heavily by British intelligence agent [[Edward William Charles Noel]] during this time. But the growing strength of Turkish nationalist forces by 1920 undermined Noel's policy ambitions, especially in the north.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

The British grew further hesitant to establish a "quasi-autonomous" independent Kurdistan in the south because of the possibility that the French would respond by establishing a similar state with French advisers in the north.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

===Sheikh Mahmud's rebellions===
[[File:Mahmud Barzanji.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Mahmud Barzanji]] in 1919]]
After World War I and after full Turkish evacuation of southern Kurdistan, Britain reached an agreement with [[Mahmud Barzanji|Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji]] and other Kurdish notables on what was later called 'The Tribal System' or 'The Sandeman System' named after Sir [[Robert Groves Sandeman]]. It was based on the principle of indirect rule. Tribal chieftains were entrusted with the government of their own tribes and were made responsible for British administrative duties through Sheikh Mahmud. They were recognized and paid as British government officials. This region of south Kurdistan became known as the South Kurdish Confederation. Many other Kurdish tribes soon agreed to join this system. After years of war and struggle, they were eager to join a peaceful settlement that might offer them protection and financial support.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

This system eventually fell apart due to disagreements between Sheikh Mahmud and the British. The British had created quite a powerful Kurdish leader through their financial support. Sheikh Mahmud developed a very opportunistic strategy towards the British. After building up so much power in the region, Sheikh Mahmud eventually started an all out rebellion against the British after they attempted to curb his unruly behavior. The Sheikh and his followers were defeated in June 1919.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

The Sheikh by no means commanded the support of all Kurds in the confederation. The Sheikh's call to arms against the British under nationalism and Islam proved mostly futile. Kurds in southern Kurdistan were too unfamiliar with the concept of nationalism. And their past experiences under the Sultan with [[jihad]] during World War I for four years against the British had proved a failure.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

===The Air Scheme===

An aspect that ultimately spelled the downfall for a British policy supporting an autonomous Kurdistan was the Air Scheme policy. This policy of using primarily the Royal Air Force as the dominant military presence in Mesopotamia was experimental at the time. The Air Scheme was popular among British policymakers. The biggest proponents of the Air Scheme were also among the biggest supporters of a "Greater Iraq." The preference in early 1920 strategy was to include southern Kurdistan under the auspices of the British Air Scheme. British policy at this point still regarded northern Kurdistan as would be described in articles 62-64 of the Treaty of Sèvres.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

However, in policy meetings that took place in [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo]] in March 1921 British policy towards the Kurds was altered. The newly formed Middle East Department concluded that "purely Kurdish areas should not be included in the Arab state of Mesopotamia". The framers of this policy stated that Kurdish areas would be put under control of the [[British High Commission]] and not under control of any Iraqi government. Noel and others supported this position because they thought Kurds would prefer rule closer to home and rule that was not under Arabs or Turks. This position was also thought to be strategic because an autonomous Kurdistan would create a buffer between the Turks outside of Iraq as well as anti-British movements within Iraq. [[Winston Churchill]], the Secretary of Colonies at the time, agreed with these sentiments and this position. Churchill also feared that a future ruler of Iraq would oppress the Kurdish minority.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

In the end, this policy was reversed largely by the work of Sir [[Percy Cox]], the first High Commissioner of Iraq. Over time, Cox became convinced that it was best to include southern Kurdistan as an integral part of Iraq, for financial and fiscal purposes. Under the impression that such a policy would not go against the policy adopted in Cairo, Churchill agreed to this new policy. Correspondence shows that Churchill still assumed that the only link between the southern Kurdish regions and Iraq would be through the British High Commission.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

As Turkish forces grew in strength and militancy, Cox began dealing with [[King Faisal I of Iraq]] in determining how Kurds in southern Kurdistan should be incorporated into Iraq territorially and politically. Cox and Faysal devised a policy whereby Kurdish regions could decide whether or not to join Iraq politically instead of merely territorially under the High Commission. Cox claimed that two out of the four of these defined Kurdish districts wished to become part of Iraq. Churchill was convinced and went along with the policy and Cox's dealings with Faysal.&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

==Persia==
[[File:Simko Sikaki.jpg|thumb|right|165px|[[Simko Shikak]], leader of the 1922 rebellion in [[Persia]]]]
After the Armistice, Kurdish nationalistic sentiments grew in Persian Kurdistan where before it had few adherents. This was due in part to the Ottoman Sultan's support. These pan-Islamic policies were designed to win over the Kurds in the region in the possibility of using them as a barrier against the Russians or Armenians.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

However, Kurdish nationalism grew in other environments. In 1918, members of the Mukri tribe of the [[Mahabad]] region were in talks with British officials discussing a possible scheme for an independent Kurdish state under British protection. Like Sharif Pasha, these individuals stressed their desire for autonomy and a desire to reach a peace agreement with the Armenians.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

Later in 1921, the Persian Kurd, [[Simko Shikak]] pursued a different strategy. Simko dealt directly with Persian and Russian officials. He became impatient with Persia's unwillingness to act on granting Kurdish autonomy, and so rebelled in 1922. In the Persian operations against Simko's rebellion, Turkish armies provided valuable support. The rebellion was quickly put down. Following this rebellion, however, Major Noel tried, unsuccessfully, to bring together Simko and other Kurdish nationalist leaders, including Shaykh Mahmud. The object was to create a Kurdish alliance to frustrate Turkish designs. No agreement was reached between these leaders.&lt;ref name="Jwaideh"/&gt;

==The Treaty of Lausanne==

After it became apparent how vehemently the government in Ankara opposed the Treaty of Sèvres and with the rising power of the Kemalists, Major Noel and the British began seriously considering supporting a Kurdish rebellion. The fear that the rebellion might not be controllable resulted in the plan's abandonment.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

This plan was revived, however, in 1921 after Kemalist troops were found meddling with tribes south of the Armistice line. British policymakers again began contemplating assisting a wide-scale Kurdish rebellion against the Turks in order to counter their growing strength and influence in the region. There were many drawbacks to this plan. This would reflect negatively on King Faysal of Iraq, as weapons would come to northern Kurdistan via Iraq. If the revolt failed, it was thought that the British in Iraq would face a massive amount of Kurdish refugees. There was also the constant worry that Kurdish leaders were unreliable and the Kurdish forces were not unified. But the French had reached an agreement with the government in Ankara on the basis of the National Pact rather than the Treaty of Sèvres. This was done after the Greeks seemed likely to lose against the Turks. France ceded much of its previously occupied land in southern Anatolia, thus providing the Kemalists with the ideal assembly point for an assault on British occupied Iraq. This caused the British to re-evaluate the plausibility of their plans to foment rebellion among the Kurds against the Turks.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson"/&gt;

Yet it still appeared that the British favored Kurdish autonomy in Iraq when they issued a Joint Declaration with the Iraqi government in 1922 that was communicated to the League of Nations. It recognized the right of the Kurds to form a government within the borders of Iraq.&lt;ref name="Yildiz 2005 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yildiz|first=Kerim|title=The Kurds in Iraq: past, present and future |year=2007|publisher=Pluto Press, The Kurdish Human Rights Project|location=London|isbn=0745326633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, as Kemalist forces spread and grew in strength, "the British desire for peace with Turkey, on the best terms for itself, of course, subordinated Britain's Kurdish policy to this objective." (p.&amp;nbsp;81). It became desirable for the British to negotiate peace with Turkey on much different terms than those of the Treaty of Sèvres.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

[[File:4969062 f520.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Signing of the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]]]]
On 24 July 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed between the British, their allies, and the Turks. The treaty failed to mention the Kurds, even though they made up around 1/3rd of the population of Turkey in the new borders and contained 48.5 percent of the total Kurdish population.&lt;ref name="Yildiz 2007"/&gt;

Borders between Turkey and Iraq were to be decided between Great Britain and Turkey within nine months of the implementation of the treaty. Kurdish leaders did petition the [[League of Nations]] and Britain for the recognition of Kurdish autonomy during negotiations on the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. In the end, the League of Nations abandoned ethnic considerations in favor of economic and strategic ones. Kurdish territory in modern-day Iraq was granted to Iraq, under British control. The Kurdish regions were fully incorporated into the state in 1923 when Iraq held its first elections to the Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref name="McDowall"/&gt;

The Iraqi Prime Minister, before the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, was authorized to meet with Kurdish tribal leaders in [[Sulaymaniyah]] in 1923. By this time, he found that they were very much in support of the plan to recognize their national aspirations but within the framework of one country. They even displayed support to King Faysal in a meeting with him in May 1923. These Kurdish leaders, as well as other Kurdish business men and dignitaries were opposed to Shaykh Mahmud's style of nationalism because of his history of political manipulation and lawlessness. According to Muhsin al-Musawi, many tribal Shaykhs and many in the Kurdish elite were strongly inclined by this time to a unified Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Musawi|first=Muhsin|title=Reading Iraq: Culture and Power in Conflict|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=1845110706|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kurds in Iraq established the short-lived [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]] in the city of [[Sulaymaniyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&amp;pg=PA384&amp;lpg=PA384&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+the+Peoples+of+Africa+and+the+Middle+East+Kingdom+Kurdistan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uZUrLwfvz5&amp;sig=wkk1qRK7gmh2P8nYy3BSNt1rxJ4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r7MNUfjYGOim4gTk5oGQCg&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Kingdom%20Kurdistan&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Kingdom of Kurdistan|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJbXNA76tewC&amp;pg=RA1-PA507&amp;lpg=RA1-PA507&amp;dq=kingdom+of+kurdistan+1921&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bmTyVRDy8t&amp;sig=WqA1Iph5zwzbyhD6Dz32UDRsO0k&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lq4NUcTvFOml4gTC2oGADA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=k%C3%B6nigreich%20kurdistan&amp;f=false|title=Der Kurdistan-Irak-Konflikt: der Weg zur Autonomie seit dem ersten Weltkrieg|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingdom lasted from September 1922 until July 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, J.

The {{Nihongo|'''Emishi''' or '''Ebisu'''|[[wiktionary:蝦夷|蝦夷]]||}} constituted an [[ethnic group]] of people who lived in northeastern [[Honshū]] in the [[Tōhoku region]] which was referred to as {{Nihongo|''michi no oku''|道の奥||}} in contemporary sources. The first mention of them in literature dates to [[Common Era|AD]] 400,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} in which they are mentioned as "the hairy people" from the Chinese records. Some Emishi tribes resisted the rule of the [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]]s during the late [[Nara Period|Nara]] and early [[Heian period]]s (7th–10th centuries AD).{{clarify|reason="late Nara" is the late eighth century. The seventh century was the mid-to-late Asuka period.|date=October 2017}} The origin of the Emishi is unknown, but they are often thought to have descended from the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon people]] and been related to the [[Ainu people]].

==History==
The Emishi were represented by different tribes, some of whom became allies of the Japanese (''fushu, ifu'') and others of whom remained hostile (''iteki'').&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, pp. 110–113.&lt;/ref&gt; The Emishi in northeastern Honshū relied on their [[horse]]s in warfare. They developed a unique style of warfare in which horse archery and hit-and-run tactics proved very effective against the slower contemporary Japanese imperial army that mostly relied on [[heavy infantry]]. Their livelihood was based on hunting and gathering as well as on the cultivation of grains such as [[millet]] and [[barley]]. Recently, it has been thought that they practiced rice cultivation in areas where rice could be easily grown. The first major attempts to subjugate the Emishi in the 8th century were largely unsuccessful. The imperial armies, which were modeled after the mainland Chinese armies, were no match for the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics of the Emishi.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, William Wayne, ''Heavenly Warriors'' (Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]], 1992), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the development of horse archery and the adoption of Emishi tactics by the early Japanese warriors that led to the Emishi defeat. The success of the gradual change in battle tactics came at the very end of the 8th century in the 790s under the command of the general [[Sakanoue no Tamuramaro]].&lt;ref&gt;Farris, pp. 94–95, 108–113.&lt;/ref&gt; They either submitted themselves to imperial authority as ''fushu'' and ''ifu'' or migrated further north, some to [[Hokkaidō]]. By the mid-9th century, most of their land in Honshū was conquered, and they ceased to be independent. However, they continued to be influential in local politics as subjugated, though powerful, Emishi families created semi-autonomous feudal domains in the north. In the two centuries following the conquest, a few of these domains became regional states that came into conflict with the central government.

=== Etymology ===
The record of [[Emperor Jimmu]] in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' mentions the "Emishi" (愛瀰詩) with [[ateji]]—whom his armed forces defeated before he was enthroned as the [[Emperor of Japan]].&lt;ref name="Iwate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwate-np.co.jp/sekai/sekaiisan/sekaiisan6.htm|script-title=ja:朝廷軍の侵略に抵抗|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Iwate Nippo]]|date=September 24, 2004|accessdate=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Nihon Shoki'', [[Takenouchi no Sukune]] in the era of [[Emperor Keikō]] proposed that they should subjugate Emishi (蝦夷) of Hitakami no Kuni (日高見国) in  eastern Japan.&lt;ref name="Iwate" /&gt; The first mention of Emishi from a source outside Japan was in the Chinese ''[[Book of Song]]'' in 478 which referred to them as "hairy people" (毛人). The book refers to "the 55 kingdoms (国) of the hairy people (毛人) of the East" as a report by King Bu—one of the [[Five kings of Wa]].

Most likely by the 7th century AD, the Japanese used this kanji to describe these people, but changed the reading from ''kebito'' or ''mōjin'' to ''Emishi''. Furthermore, during the same century, the kanji character was changed to 蝦夷, which is composed of the kanji for "shrimp" and for "barbarian". This is thought to refer to the long whiskers of a shrimp; however, this is not certain. The barbarian aspect clearly described an outsider, living beyond the border of the emerging empire of Japan, which saw itself as a civilizing influence; thus, the empire was able to justify its conquest. This kanji was first seen in the T'ang sources that describe the meeting with the two Emishi that the Japanese envoy brought with him to China (see [[#Emishi envoys to the Tang court|below]]). The kanji character may have been adopted from China, but the reading "Ebisu" and "Emishi" were Japanese in origin and most likely came from either the Japanese "yumishi" which means bowman (their main weapon) or "emushi" which is sword in the [[Ainu language|Ainu tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, Takashi, 蝦夷 (''Emishi'') (Tokyo: Chuo koron, 1986), pp.22–27. Good discussion on the possible origins of the name.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other origins—such as the word ''enchiu'' for "man" in the Ainu tongue—have been proposed. However, the way it sounds is almost phonetically identical to ''emushi'' so it may most likely have had an Ainoid origin. "Ainoid" distinguishes the people who are related to, or who are ancestors of, the Ainu, who first emerge as "Ezo" in Hokkaido in the Kamakura period and then become known as Ainu in the modern period.

===Battles with Yamato army===
The ''Nihon Shoki''{{'}}s entry for [[Emperor Yūryaku]], also known as Ohatsuse no Wakatakeru, records an uprising, after the Emperor's death, of Emishi troops who had been levied to support an expedition to [[Korea]]. Emperor Yūryaku is suspected to be King Bu, but the date and the existence of Yūryaku are uncertain, and the Korean reference may be anachronistic. However, the compilers clearly felt that the reference to Emishi troops was credible in this context.

In 658, [[Abe no Hirafu]]'s naval expedition of 180 ships reaches ''Aguta'' (present day [[Akita Prefecture|Akita]]) and Watarishima (Hokkaidō). An alliance with ''Aguta'' Emishi, Tsugaru Emishi and Watarishima Emishi was formed by Abe who then stormed and defeated a settlement of [[Mishihase]] (Su-shen in the Aston translation of the ''Nihongi'') a people of unknown origin. This is one of the earliest reliable records of the Emishi people extant. The Mishihase may have been another ethnic group who competed with the ancestors of the Ainu for Hokkaidō. The expedition happens to be the furthest northern penetration of the Japanese Imperial army until the 16th century, and that later settlement was from a local Japanese warlord who was independent of any central control.&lt;ref&gt;Aston, W. G. trans. ''Nihongi'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle), pp. 252, 260, 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Susumu Nakanishi|Nakanishi, Susumu]], ''{{lang|ja|エミシとは何か}}'' (''{{transl|ja|Emishi to wa nanika}}''), (Tokyo:Kadokawa shoten,1993), pp. 134–140. Modern analysis of the expedition.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 709, the fort of [[Ideha]] was created close to present day [[Akita, Akita|Akita]]. This was a bold move since the intervening territory between Akita and the northwestern countries of Japan was not under government control. The Emishi of Akita in alliance with Michinoku attacked Japanese settlements in response. [[Saeki no Iwayu]] was appointed ''Sei Echigo Emishi shōgun''. He used 100 ships from the Japan sea side countries along with soldiers recruited from the eastern countries and defeated the Echigo (present day Akita) Emishi.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, p.86. Farris's account does not have all the details, but is a readily available source for the war's chronology in English.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 724, [[Site of Tagajō|Taga Fort]] was built by [[Ōno no Azumabito|Ōno no Omi Azumahito]] near present-day [[Sendai]] and became the largest administrative fort in the northeast region of Michinoku. As ''Chinju shōgun'' he steadily built forts across the Sendai plain and into the interior mountains in what is now [[Yamagata Prefecture]]. Guerilla warfare was practiced by the horse riding Emishi who kept up pressure on these forts, but Emishi allies ''ifu'' and ''fushu'' were also recruited and promoted by the Japanese to fight against their kinsmen.

In 758, after a long period of stalemate, the Japanese army under Fujiwara no Asakari penetrated into what is now northern [[Miyagi Prefecture]], and established [[Momonofu Castle]] on the [[Kitakami River]]. The fort was built despite constant attacks by the Emishi of Isawa (present-day southern Iwate prefecture).

773 AD marked the beginning of the Thirty-Eight Years' War ({{lang|ja|[[:ja:蝦夷征討#三十八年戦争|三十八年戦争]]}}) with the defection of Korehari no Azamaro, a high-ranking Emishi officer of the Japanese army based in [[Taga Castle]]. The Emishi counterattacked along a broad front starting with Momonohu Castle, destroying the garrison there before going on to destroy a number of forts along a defensive line from east to west established painstakingly over the past generation. Even Taga Castle was not spared. Large Japanese forces were recruited, numbering in the thousands, the largest forces perhaps ten to twenty thousand strong fighting against an Emishi force that numbered at most around three thousand warriors, and at any one place around a thousand. In 776 a huge army of over 20,000 men was sent to attack the [[Shiwa Emishi]], but failed to destroy the enemy who then successfully counterattacked their cumbersome foes in the [[Ōu Mountains]]. In 780 the Emishi attacked the [[Sendai]] plain, torching Japanese villages there. The Japanese were in a near panic as they tried to tax and recruit more soldiers from the [[Kantō region|Bandō]].&lt;ref&gt;Farris, pp. 90–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 789 AD Battle of Koromo River (also known as Battle of Sufuse) the Japanese army under [[Ki no Kosami]] ''Seito shōgun'' was defeated by the Isawa Emishi under their general [[Aterui]]. A four thousand-strong army was attacked as they tried to cross the Kitakami River by a force of a thousand Emishi. The imperial army suffered its most stunning defeat, losing a thousand men, many of whom drowned.

In 794, many key Shiwa Emishi including [[Isawa no kimi Anushiko]] of what is now northern [[Miyagi Prefecture]] became allies of the Japanese. This was a stunning reversal to the aspirations of those Emishi who still fought against the Japanese. The Shiwa Emishi were a very powerful group and were able to attack smaller Emishi groups successfully as their leaders were promoted into imperial rank. This had the effect of isolating one of the most powerful and independent Emishi, the [[Isawa confederation]]. The newly appointed ''[[shōgun]]'' general, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, then attacked the Isawa Emishi, relentlessly using soldiers trained in horse archery. The result was a desultory campaign that eventually led to Aterui's surrender in 802. The war was mostly over and many Emishi groups submitted themselves to the imperial government. However, skirmishes still took place and it was not until 811 that the so-called Thirty-Eight Years' War was over.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi, pp. 168–196. Very detailed analysis of the end of the war and the effects on the former Emishi territory.&lt;/ref&gt;  North of the [[Kitakami River]], the Emishi were still independent, but the large scale threat that they posed ceased with the defeat of the Isawa Emishi in 802.

===Abe clan, Kiyohara clan and Northern Fujiwara===
{{Main|Abe clan|Kiyohara clan|Northern Fujiwara}}
After their conquest, some Emishi leaders became part of the regional framework of government in the Tōhoku culminating with the [[Northern Fujiwara]] regime. This regime and others such as the [[Abe clan|Abe]] and [[Kiyohara clan|Kiyohara]] were created by local Japanese ''[[gōzoku]]'' and became regional semi-independent states based on the Emishi and Japanese people. However, even before these emerged, the Emishi people progressively lost their distinct culture and ethnicity as they became minorities.

The Northern Fujiwara were thought to have been Emishi, but there is some doubt as to the lineage of them, and if they were descended from local Japanese families who resided in the Tōhoku (unrelated to the Fujiwara of Kyoto) then the study would confirm this. Both the Abe and Kiyohara families were almost certainly of Japanese descent, both of whom represented ''gōzoku'', powerful families who had moved into the provinces of Mutsu and Dewa perhaps during the ninth century though when they emigrated is not known for certain. They were likely a Japanese frontier family who developed regional ties with the descendants of the Emishi ''fushu'', and may have been seen as ''fushu'' themselves since they had lived in the region for several generations.

Soon after [[World War II]], mummies of the Northern Fujiwara family in [[Hiraizumi]] (the capital city of the Northern Fujiwara), hence thought to have been related to the Ainu, were studied by scientists. However, the researchers concluded that the rulers of Hiraizumi were like other Japanese of the time, and certainly not related to the ethnic Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as evidence that the Emishi were not related to the Ainu. This had the effect of popularizing the idea that the Emishi were like other contemporary ethnic Japanese who lived in northeast Japan, outside of Yamato rule.

[[Minamoto no Yoritomo]], a descendant of [[Emperor Seiwa]], finally defeated the Northern Fujiwara in 1189 and established the [[Kamakura shogunate]] in 1192.

==Ethnic lineage==
===Emishi–Ainu theory===
This theory suggests that Emishi is [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. With the cold weather of the [[Kofun period]], the bearer of the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]] that flourished mainly in [[Hokkaido]] contacted and interacted with the bearer of Kofun culture who came northward from southwest Japan, reaching the vicinity of the [[:ja:仙台平野|Sendai plain]] south of the northern Tōhoku region. After that, Emishi in Hokkaido is finally inherited to the Ainu.

===Other theories===
There is a theory that the Emishi spoke the "[[:ja:ズーズー弁|Zūzū dialect]]" (the ancestor of [[Tōhoku dialect]]) and are a different ethnic group from the [[Ainu people|Ainu]].&lt;ref name = "Koizumi 1998"&gt;小泉保（1998）『縄文語の発見』青土社 (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; Especially from the similarity of [[Tōhoku dialect]] and [[Umpaku dialect|Izumo dialect]], it is suggested that some of [[:ja:出雲族|Izumo people]] who did not obey [[:ja:ヤマト王権|Yamato royalty]] after the [[:ja:国譲り|delegation of governance]] escaped to [[Tōhoku region]] and became Emishi.&lt;ref&gt;高橋克彦（2013）『東北・蝦夷の魂』現代書館 (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;『古代に真実を求めて 第七集（古田史学論集）』2004年、古田史学の会（編集） (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Jōmon and Ainu==
{{more citations needed|date=January 2013}}
{{See also|Japanese people|Ainu people|Satsumon culture}}
Recent scholarship has created a much more complicated portrait of this people. By and large, they are seen as [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to Japan and not simply as ancestors to the Ainu, but descendants of the [[Jōmon]]. Even though historically they emerge as serious challengers to the nascent Japanese state, they had inherited a rich and separate tradition that went back several millennia before the Japanese speakers came to the islands of Japan.

In the study of Jōmon skeletal remains dating from thousands of years ago, a direct connection with the modern Ainu was confirmed, showing a definite linkage between the two groups. This linkage however, shows that the Jōmon people were very different from modern Japanese and other modern East Asians. The physical appearance of a number of the Ainu who were first encountered by the Europeans in the 19th century were similar to Caucasians, and thus caused quite a stir among contemporary academics, and has spurred debate about their origins. It is thus surmised that the Jōmon also were physically unlike other East Asians. This said, physical anthropologists have found that diachronically, and geographically, the skeletal structure of the Jōmon population changed over time from southwest to northeast, paralleling the actual migration of Japanese speakers historically, so that more Jōmon traits are preserved in the north.

Studies have also shown that skeletal remains from larger settlements in the Tōhoku corresponding to places where burial mounds (kofun) were built have traits that are halfway between Ainu and present day Japanese, so the idea that the Emishi were made up solely of Ainoid ancestors is untrue.  The Emishi were a mix of both Ainoid and types of people scholars have called "''[[Kofun]]'' people" who were not a separate race or ethnic group, but were a mixture of both native Jōmon and the more recent groups identified with the [[Yayoi culture]]. This dovetails nicely with the "transformation" theory that native Jōmon peoples changed gradually with the infusion of Yayoi immigrants into the Tōhoku rather than the "replacement" theory which posits that one population (Jōmon) was replaced by another (Yayoi).&lt;ref&gt;Ossenberg, Nancy (see reference) has the best evidence of this relationship with the Jōmon. Also, a newer study, Ossenberg, et al., "Ethnogenesis and craniofacial change in Japan from the perspective of nonmetric traits" (''Anthropological Science'' v.114:99-115) is an updated analysis published in 2006 which confirms this finding.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emishi were composed of two main populations, the Jōmon Ainoid who were the majority and a smaller group the ''Kofun'' united by a common Ainoid language distinct from Japanese. These two populations were not distinguished by contemporaries, but rather by present-day physical anthropologists. Historically, they were seen as one group by contemporaries, mainly those who were descendants of the natives (the Jōmon) called ''Emishi'' and ''Ebisu'' who also had in their population those of mixed ethnicity, most likely descendants of early Japanese colonists. In addition, the contemporary Japanese for their part looked upon the Emishi as foreigners and barbarians whose lands they desired to conquer and incorporate into the Japanese state.

Though it is not known how much the Emishi population changed as Japanese settlers and frontiersmen began to live in their territories even before the conquest, the existence of Emishi ''Kofun'' types attests to some form of ethnic mixing. The Japanese established trading relations with the Emishi by which their horses were imported and iron tools and weapons exported to their territories. To complicate matters, some ethnic Japanese allied themselves with the Emishi in their wars against the Yamato court. The latter were known in the ''Nihon Shoki'' as "Japanese captives" of the Emishi.

The people who migrated to the northern tip of Honshū and Hokkaidō region retained their identity and their separate ethnicity, and their descendants eventually formed the [[Satsumon culture]] in Hokkaidō. Historically, they became a distinctly different population from those who were conquered and integrated into the Japanese state. The Emishi (not including them) became more like other ethnic Japanese while the Hokkaidō Emishi, known by contemporaries as ''Watarishima'' Emishi, or "Emishi who crossed to the island", eventually became known as the [[Ezo]], and later in the modern period the Ainu.

==Envoys to the Tang court==
The evidence that the Emishi were also related to the Ainu comes from historical documents. One of the best sources of information comes from both inside and outside Japan, from contemporary [[Tang dynasty|Tang-]] and [[Song dynasty|Song-dynasty]] histories as these describe dealings with Japan, and from the ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]''. For example, there is a record of the arrival of the Japanese foreign minister in AD 659 in which conversation is recorded with the Tang Emperor.  In this conversation we have perhaps the most accurate picture of the Emishi recorded for that time period. This episode is repeated in the ''Shoku Nihongi'' in the following manner:

Two Emishi, a man and woman, from contemporary Tōhoku accompanied the minister Sakaibe no Muraji to Tang China.  The emperor was delighted with the two Emishi because of their "strange" physical appearance. This emperor was most likely the [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Tang Taizong]] who was familiar with many ethnic groups throughout his Empire, from [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] to Middle Eastern traders. The Japanese envoy for his part describes the contemporary relationship with the various Emishi: those who had allied themselves with the Yamato court (known as {{lang|ja|和蝦夷}} ''niki-emishi'', i.e. "gentle Emishi"), those who remained as enemies staunchly opposed to Yamato (known as {{lang|ja|荒蝦夷}} ''ara-emishi'', i.e. "rough Emishi" or "wild Emishi"), and the distant Tsugaru Emishi (located in present-day northern [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]] and in southern Hokkaidō). All Chinese documents from the Tang and Song refer to them as having a separate state north of Japan and call them {{lang|ja|毛人}} (Mandarin ''máo rén'', Sino-Japanese ''mōjin'', "hairy people"). This is also corroborated in the ''Shoku Nihongi'', in which they are described consistently as having long [[beard]]s and as ''kebito'', or "hairy people", characteristics that have been used to describe the Ainu in the modern period. These same kanji characters were read as "emishi" before the Nara period.

==In popular culture==

*The term ''Emishi'' is used for the village tribe of the main character Ashitaka in the [[Hayao Miyazaki]] animated film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]''. The village was a last pocket of Emishi surviving into the [[Muromachi period]] (16th century).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311680710_Japanese_Mythology_in_Film_A_Semiotic_Approach_to_Reading_Japanese_Film_and_Anime_Paperback&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4600">'''Engels’ Pause''' refers to the early period of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]], when, due to great technological upheaval, the livelihood of a large number of people worsened before society began to prosper in the longer term. The term was coined by an [[Economic history|economic historian]], [[Robert C. Allen]], who links the idea to a view of the Britain of 1760–1913. During the first half of the nineteenth century in Britain, wage growth stagnated while output per worker nonetheless grew. After the middle of the nineteenth century, [[real wages]] began growing in line with productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/Users/Allen/engelspause.pdf|title=Engels' pause: Technical change, capital accumulation and inequality in the British industrial revolution|last=Allen|first=Robert C.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engels’ Pause in the 21st century ==
The Industrial Revolution in the 19th century was an all-encompassing societal transformation, which concerned everything from technology and culture to social structures and the economy. The changes caused by industrialisation meant that the principles of society had to be redesigned. It has been argued that a similar transformation is currently underway in industrialised Western nations, where [[Digitization|digitisation]] and robotisation are transforming society. In the [[Western world]], particularly the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], the 2010s can be seen as the beginning of a similar ”pause”, in which the position of workers and the capacity of current systems to maintain the development of society are at least temporarily weakened.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.sitra.fi/2017/01/08121209/From_pause_to_play_Sitra_Demos.pdf|title=From pause to play. Work and income in the next era|last=Hautamäki, Leppänen, Mokka, Neuvonen|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the think tank [[Demos Helsinki]] has written that in addition to the economy, the whole of society is changing its shape at this point in time, just like in the Industrial Revolution. During [[industrialisation]], productivity began to increase as the pillars of society and business were designed in accordance with the new modes of operation. This eventually led to an unprecedented period of prosperity. At the same time, two new [[Social class|social classes]] were born: the [[working class]], with a major part of 20th century politics revolving around improving their living conditions, and the [[middle class]], whose expansion was one of the most important results of the increase in prosperity triggered by industrialisation and political reforms. Likewise, the birth of the political party landscape and urban planning in their current forms can be placed at the beginning of industrialisation. It is possible that digitisation and robotisation have initiated a decades-long period of transformation comparable to the industrial revolution, during which the basic structures of society will shake, forms of livelihood will change and wealth will be radically redistributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the time of the first Engels’ Pause, there were big changes in, for example, the social security system, the party system, elementary schools, urban planning, public transport and many other areas of society, in order to enable society to respond to the transformation caused by industrialisation. 

Allen, the inventor of the term “Engels’ Pause”, has also reflected on the similarities between 19th century industrialisation and the present day. He does not, however, directly use the term “Engels’ Pause” in his deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Robert C.|date=2017-10-19|title=Lessons from history for the future of work|url=https://www.nature.com/news/lessons-from-history-for-the-future-of-work-1.22825|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=550|issue=7676|pages=321–324|doi=10.1038/550321a|pmid=29052648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Andrew McAfee]] have also referred to a similar phenomenon with their concept of ”[[the Second Machine Age]]”. The term refers to how people’s incomes do not increase although technology is developing and enables more efficient production.

'''Ethnic studies''', in the United States, is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of difference—chiefly race, ethnicity, and nation, but also sexuality, gender, and other such markings—and power, as expressed by the state, by civil society, and by individuals. Ethnic studies is an academic field that spans the humanities and the social sciences, it emerged as an academic field in the second half of the 20th century partly in response to charges that traditional social science and humanities disciplines such as [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[cultural studies]], and [[area studies]] which were conceived from an inherently [[Eurocentric]] perspective. Its origin, then, lies in the civil rights era, when ethnic studies was originally conceived to re-frame the way that specific disciplines had told the stories, histories, struggles and triumphs of people of color on what was seen to be their own terms. In recent years, it has broadened its focus to include questions of representation, [[racialization]], [[racial formation theory]], and more determinedly interdisciplinary topics and approaches.

==History==
In the United States, the field of ethnic studies evolved out of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1960s and early 1970s, which contributed to growing self-awareness and radicalization of people of color such as African-Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. Ethnic studies departments were established on college campuses across the country and have grown to encompass [[African American Studies]], [[Asian American Studies]], [[La Raza|Raza]] Studies, [[Chicano Studies]], Mexican American Studies, and [[Native American Studies]], as well as Jewish-American Studies and Italian-American Studies.
 
The first strike demanding the establishment of an Ethnic Studies department occurred in 1968, led by the [[Third World Liberation Front]] (TWLF), a joint effort of the Black Student Union, Latin American Students Organization, Asian American Political Alliance, Pilipino American Collegiate Endeavor, and Native American Students Union at [[San Francisco State University]]. This was the longest student strike in the nation's history, and resulted in the establishment of a School of Ethnic Studies. President [[S. I. Hayakawa]] ended the strike after taking a hardline approach,when he appointed Dr. James Hirabayashi the first dean of the School (now College) of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/profile.php?profile=Hirabayashi, James]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased recruiting and admissions of students of color in response to the strike's demands. In 1972, The National Association for Ethnic Studies was founded to foster interdisciplinary discussions for scholars and activists concerned with the national and international dimensions of ethnicity encouraging conversations related to anthropology, Africana Studies, Native Studies, Sociology and American Studies among other fields.

Minority students at The [[University of California at Berkeley]]- united under their own Third World Liberation Front, the TWLF, initiated the second longest student strike in the history of this country on January 22, 1969. The groups involved were the Mexican American Student Confederation, Asian American Political Alliance, African American Student Union, and the Native American group. The four co-Chairmen of the TWLF were Ysidro Macias, Richard Aoki, Charlie Brown, and LaNada Means.

This strike at Berkeley was even more violent than the San Francisco State strike, in that more than five police departments, the California Highway Patrol, Alameda County Deputies, and finally, the California National Guard were ordered onto the Berkeley campus by Ronald Reagan in the effort to quash the strike. The excessive use of police force has been cited with promoting the strike by the alienation of non-striking students and faculty, who protested the continual presence of police on the Berkeley campus. The faculty union voted to join the strike on March 2, and two days later the Academic Senate called on the administration to grant an interim Department of Ethnic Studies. On March 7, 1969, President Hitch authorized the establishment of the first Ethnic Studies Department in the country, followed by the establishment of the nation's first College of Ethnic Studies at [[San Francisco State University]] on March 20, 1969. 

Courses in ethnic studies address perceptions that, because of the Eurocentric bias and racial and ethnic prejudice of those in power, American historians have systematically ignored or undervalued the roles of such ethnic minorities as Asian Americans, Blacks, Mexicans, Latinos and Native Americans.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Ethnic studies also often encompasses issues of [[intersectionality]], where gender, class, and sexuality also come into play. There are now hundreds of African American, Asian American, Mexican American and Chicano/Latino Studies departments in the US, approximately fifty Native American Studies departments, and a small number of comparative ethnic studies programs. College students, especially on the East Coast, continue to advocate for Ethnic Studies departments. The Ethnic Studies Coalition at [[Wellesley College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewellesleynews.com/2018/10/25/ethnic-studies-coalition-pushes-for-ethnic-studies-major-at-wellesley/|title=Ethnic Studies Coalition pushes for Ethnic Studies major at Wellesley {{!}} The Wellesley News|website=thewellesleynews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Taskforce for Asian and Pacific American Studies at [[Harvard University]], and CRAASH at [[Hunter College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/university-students-alumni-fight-increase-asian-american-studies-n589246|title=University Students, Alumni Fight for Growth in Asian American Studies|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; are among student organizations calling for increased institutional support for Ethnic Studies. Ethnic studies as an institutional discipline varies by location. For instance, whereas the Ethnic Studies Department at [[UC Berkeley]] comprises separate "core group" departments, the department at [[UC San Diego]] does not do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050319222738/http://www.columbiaspectator.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2005/02/09/4209bd8f7f02c]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
While early ethnic studies scholarship focused on the repressed histories and identities of various groups in the U.S., the field of study has expanded to encompass transnationalism, comparative race Studies, and postmodernist/poststructuralist critiques. While pioneering thinkers relied on frameworks, theories and methodologies such as those found in the allied fields of sociology, history, literature and film, scholars in the field today utilize multidisciplinary as well as comparative perspectives, increasingly within an international or transnational context. Central to much Ethnic Studies scholarship is understanding how race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and other categories of difference intersect to shape the lived experiences of people of color, what the legal scholar [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw|Kimberle Crenshaw]] calls intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1229039|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|first=Kimberle|last=Crenshaw|date=January 1, 1991|publisher=|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–1299|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most recently, "whiteness" studies has been included as a popular site of inquiry in what is a traditionally academic field for studying the racial formation of communities of color. Instead of including whites as another additive component to ethnic studies, [[whiteness studies]] has instead focused on how the political and juridical category of white has been constructed and protected in relation to racial "others" and how it continues to shape the relationship between bodies of color and the State. As Ian Haney-Lopez articulates in ''White By Law: The Legal Construction of Race'', the law has functioned as the vehicle through which certain racialized groups have been included or excluded from the category of whiteness across time, and thus marked as inside or outside the national imaginary (read as white) and the privileges that result from this belonging.&lt;ref&gt;''White By Law: The Legal Construction of Race''&lt;/ref&gt; Important to whiteness studies, according to scholars such as Richard Dyer, is understanding how white bodies are both invisible and hypervisible, and how representations of whiteness in visual culture reflect and, in turn, shape a persistent commitment to white supremacy in the U.S. even as some claim the nation is currently a colorblind meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;''White''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to visual culture, space also reproduces and normalizes whiteness. The sociologist George Lipsitz argues that whiteness is a condition rather than a skin color, a structured advantage of accumulated privilege that resurfaces across time spatially and obscures the racism that continues to mark certain bodies as out of place and responsible for their own disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz (2011)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lipsitz |first=George |title=How Racism Takes Place |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-43990-256-1 |pages=320 |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lv0musrlBGYC |accessdate=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such attention to geography is an example of the way ethnic studies scholars have taken up the study of race and ethnicity across almost all disciplines using various methodologies in the humanities and social sciences.

In general, an "Ethnic Studies approach" is loosely defined as any approach that emphasizes the cross-relational and intersectional study of different groups. George Lipsitz again is important here, in demonstrating how the project of anti-black racism defines the relationship between the white spatial imaginary and other communities of color. Thus the [[redlining]] of the 1930s that prevented upwardly mobile African Americans from moving into all-white neighborhoods also forced Latino and Asian bodies into certain spaces.

==Relationship to other fields==

Ethnic studies exists in dialogue—and occasional tension—with a variety of related fields and disciplines.

In the case of traditional disciplines, ethnic studies often confronts resistance if not outright hostility to its mission. With many departments clinging to the ideal of objective and detached scholarship, the field is generally seen as a more politicized (and therefore, for some, a more troubling) form of academic inquiry. This hostility reflects, in some cases, a disinterest in the diversification of subject areas and the preservation of historically prominent fields. In the case of interdisciplinary fields, as ethnic studies has moved from a study of specific racial and ethnic groups towards the scrutiny of power dynamics, it has grown closer to fields like African American studies, Asian American studies, Native American studies, Latin@ studies, and American studies. Even more recently, ethnic studies has grown philosophically and politically closer to LGTBQ studies.

"Ethnic Studies" is often housed within departments or units with many different names. Teaching units often have a range of different names—Critical Ethnic Studies,&lt;ref name="las.depaul.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://las.depaul.edu/departments/critical-ethnic-studies/Pages/default.aspx|title=Critical Ethnic Studies  -  Academics  -  DePaul University College of LAS|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226101614/http://las.depaul.edu/departments/critical-ethnic-studies/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=December 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative American Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admission.wsu.edu/academics/fos/Public/field.castle?id=7584|title=Comparative Ethnic Studies - FOS - Admissions - WSU|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethnicstudies.berkeley.edu/ethnicstudies.php|title=Comparative Ethnic Studies Program - Ethnic Studies Department - UC Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or American Studies and Ethnicity&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/ase/&lt;/ref&gt;—for curricula and faculty who are gathered together under the same set of academic interests. A wide variety of curricula are employed in the service of each of these rubrics. Occasionally, the gap between American Studies and Ethnic Studies can be productively bridged, especially in departments where the bulk of faculty focus on race and ethnicity, difference and power. But that bridgework can be troublesome, obscuring one foci and sharpening the emphasis on another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/49761|title=American Indians, American Studies, and the ASA|first=Philip Joseph|last=Deloria|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=|volume=55|issue=4|pages=669–680|accessdate=June 14, 2016|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this great variation, though, ethnic studies needs to be understood within its specific institutional context. And, despite considerable financial (and often political) pressure to consolidate or eliminate ethnic studies within American Studies—or to house Native American studies, Latin@ studies, and Asian American studies within either ethnic studies or American Studies—the relationships between these fields should be considered within each institution's governing eco-system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitalcityhues.com/041714EthnicStudiesUW.html|title=The Capital City Hues/041714/The Future of UW-Ethnic Studies|first=Jonathan|last=Gramling|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional associations==

===National Association for Ethnic Studies (NAES)===

The [http://ethnicstudies.org National Association for Ethnic Studies] was founded in 1972 by several scholars who wanted to study race through an interdisciplinary approach. It was initially named the National Association of Interdisciplinary Studies for Native-American, Black, Chicano, Puerto Rican, and Asian Americans. The organization was officially renamed in 1985.&lt;ref name="ethnicstudies.org"&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/about/naes-history&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest ethnic studies association in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding, the organization has strived to promote scholarship, research, and curriculum design for its members.&lt;ref name="ethnicstudies.org"/&gt; The organization hosts an annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/things-to-do-in-the-area&lt;/ref&gt;

NAES also publishes the Ethnic Studies Review, a peer-reviewed journal for scholarship in ethnic studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://ethnicstudies.org/publications/review&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical Ethnic Studies Association (CESA)===

The Critical Ethnic Studies Association began with its first conference in March 2011 at the University of California Riverside, Critical Ethnic Studies and the Future of Genocide: [[Settler colonialism]]/[[Heteropatriarchy]]/[[White Supremacy]]. This prompted the people who had organized and partaken in the conference to form the association. The second conference then took place in September 2013 at the University of Illinois Chicago and it was themed, Decolonizing Future Intellectual Legacies and Activist Practices. The third conference took place from April 30-May 2015 at York University in Toronto and it is titled, Sovereignties and Colonialisms: Resisting Racism, Extraction and Dispossession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/conference-information|title=CONFERENCE INFORMATION  - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530163243/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/conference-information|archivedate=May 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, ethnic studies has become entrapped within and similar to the mandates of liberal [[multiculturalism]], which relies on politics beholden to US nation-building and capitalist imperatives. Ethnic studies is in a difficult position, because as it gets more legitimizes within the academy, it has frequently done so by distancing itself from the very social movements that were the triggers for its creation. On the other hand, ethnic studies departments have always existed on the margins of the academic industrial complex, and become further marginalized through funding cuts due to the 2008 global economic crisis. Instead of just dismissing or wholly embracing identitarian nationalism, CESA seeks to construct an open dialogue around issues like white supremacy, settler colonialism, capitalism, and [[heteropatriarchy]], militarism, occupation, indigenous erasure, [[neocolonialism]], anti-immigration anti-Islam, etc. in order to expand the parameters and capacities of ethnic studies.

CESA's goal is not to romanticize all movements or dictate a specific relationship between scholars and activists. Instead, it questions the emphasis of professionalization within ethnic studies, the politics of the academic industrial complex, or the engagement of larger movements for social transformation. It recognizes that at times Ethnic Studies has been complicit in neutralizing the university, rather than questioning the university's ideologies actions, knowledge, and power. It works to situate the university as a point of contention, as a location among many for political struggles. CESA invites participation from all types of people: scholars, students, activists, arts, media makers, and educators of all fields, generations, and disciplines. The Critical Ethnic Studies Association was founded as a transnational, interdisciplinary, and un-disciplinary association of scholars, activists, students, artists, media makers, educators, and others who are directly concerned with interrogating the limitations of ethnic studies in order to better engage the historical stakes of the field. It organizes projects and programs to reimagine ethnic studies and its future through new interventions, both scholarly and activist based. They aim to develop an approach to scholarship, institution building, and activism animated by the spirit of the decolonial, antiracist, and other global liberationist movements that enabled the creation of Ethnic Studies in the first place. It hopes that this approach will continue to inform its political and intellectual projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/mission-vision|title=Mission &amp; Vision - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530163406/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/mission-vision|archivedate=May 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a huge emphasis on counteracting institutional marginalization, revisiting the ideas that prompted the creation of ethnic studies, and to create new conversations that challenge US hegemony in traditional ethnic studies. Their goals include establishing an interdisciplinary network of scholars and activists stimulating debate on critical ethnic studies, providing forums such as the biannual conference or dialogues thought seminars, social media, etc. There is also a focus on publishing a journal, ''Critical Ethnic Studies'', for new scholarships, and to facilitate dialogues that is critical and constructive between activist and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/history-goals|title=History &amp; Goals - criticalethnicstudies.org|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617094135/https://www.criticalethnicstudies.org/content/history-goals|archivedate=June 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In high schools==

===In California schools===
While ethnic studies courses have had a presence throughout high schools in Southwest states, there have been attacks on the discipline in the past couple of years, with the state of California never fully enforcing such courses in its high schools. However, students and educators of school districts across Southern California are pushing towards implementing ethnic studies courses into school requirements. The [[El Rancho Unified School District]] (ERUSD), which serves the area of Pico Rivera, became the first school district in California to require an ethnic studies class as part of its students' graduation requirement in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erusd.org/|title=El Rancho Unified School District|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic studies resolution in ERUSD was both drafted and proposed by ERUSD's board President, Aurora Villon and Vice President, Jose Lara and was presented as an effort to "expose ... students to global perspectives and inclusion of diversity".&lt;ref name="whittierdailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whittierdailynews.com/social-affairs/20140711/el-rancho-unified-school-district-authorizes-historic-ethnic-studies-graduation-requirement|title=El Rancho Unified School District authorizes historic ethnic studies graduation requirement|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This graduation requirement for ERUSD high school students is expected to be fully implemented by the 2015–2016 academic school year.&lt;ref name="whittierdailynews.com"/&gt;

In a similar move, [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD) will also begin to require ethnic studies courses in its high schools and will include such courses in its A-G graduation requirements. In November 2014, the LAUSD board approved a resolution proposed by board members Bennett Kayser, George McKenna and Steve Zimmer.&lt;ref name="laschoolreport.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laschoolreport.com/lausd-board-votes-to-add-ethnic-studies-to-schools-curriculum/|title=LAUSD board votes to add Ethnic Studies to schools' curriculum|date=November 19, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic studies curriculum will begin as a pilot program in at least five high schools.&lt;ref name="laschoolreport.com"/&gt; It is expected that by the 2017–2018 academic school year, every high school will offer at least one course in ethnic studies and the class would be compulsory by the time the class of 2019 graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ethnic-studies-20141209-story.html|title=L.A. Unified to require ethnic studies for high school graduation|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While LAUSD board members proposed the resolution, many students took on the efforts by creating petitions and rallies in support of the ethnic studies resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicstudiesnow.com/nov_23_bennett_kayser_fundraiser|title=Sunday (Nov 23) Bennett Kayser Fundraiser (EAGLE ROCK)|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicstudiesnow.com/lausd_rally_nov18|title=Nov 18 Rally &amp; Press Conference|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In New York schools===

The New York State government has implemented the Dignity for All Students Act (DASA) which requires administrative, supervisory, and student service personnel to be trained in "Harassment, Bullying, Cyber bullying, and Discrimination in Schools: Prevention and Intervention".&lt;ref name="archive.advocate.nyc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.advocate.nyc.gov/bullying/DASA|title=About the Dignity for All Students Act|publisher=|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, ethnic studies is framed through the lens of "bullying" as an challenge for minority students to get the most out of their education in a safe classroom environment. For the creators of DASA, bullying has the potential to disrupt a student's bodily and emotional safety.

DASA aims to do the following:&lt;ref name="archive.advocate.nyc.gov"/&gt;

*DASA is designed to protect public schools students from bullying by employees or other students based on actual or perceived race, color, weight, national origin, ethnic group, religion, religious practice, disability, sexual orientation, gender, or sex.
*DASA requires schools and districts to revise codes of conduct to prohibit bullying and promote a bully-free environment, and to include age-appropriate versions of the policy in codes of conduct. School districts will be required to post codes of conduct on their websites by July 1, 2013.
*DASA requires K-12 schools to incorporate curriculum that promotes awareness of and sensitivity to discrimination and diversity as part of civility and citizenship classes.
*DASA requires every school to nominate a Dignity Act Coordinator that will be responsible for handling incidents of bullying.
*DASA requires schools to collect and report data on bullying to the New York State education commissioner at least once a year.
*DASA prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports incidents of bullying.
*DASA holds the State education commissioner responsible for helping school districts develop effective responses to bullying that are focused on solutions, intervention and education.

==Political attacks==
Ethnic studies has always been opposed by different elements. Proponents of ethnic studies feel that this is a reactionary movement from the right. They note the rise of the conservative movement during the 1990s in the United States, in which the discipline came increasingly under attack. For proponents, the backlash is an attempt to preserve "traditional values" of Western culture, symbolized by the United States. For some critics, this  is a slant by proponents to disparage criticism by false association to right wing ideology. They have no objection about African, Latino or Native American culture being legitimate topics of academic research.  What they object to is the current state of ethnic studies which they see as characterized by excessive left wing political ideology, [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[relativism]] which, in their view, greatly undermined the scholarly validity of the research. However, ethnic studies is accused of promoting "racial separatism", "linguistic isolation" and "racial preference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223161232/http://www.acri.org/newsletter/june19993.htm |date=December 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Ward Churchill]], a professor of ethnic studies at [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], came under severe fire for an essay he wrote called "[[On the Justice of Roosting Chickens]]", in which he claimed that the [[September 11 attacks]] were a natural and unavoidable consequence of what he views as unlawful US policy, and referred to the "technocratic corps" working in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as "[[little Eichmanns]]".&lt;ref name="college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm"&gt;{{cite news | title = College journalist touched off firestorm | author = Charlie Brennan | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = February 3, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/feb/03/college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative commentators used the Churchill affair to attack ethnic studies departments as enclaves of "anti-Americanism" which promote the idea of ethnic groups as "victims" in US society, and not places where serious scholarship is done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldblatt |first=Mark |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200502090753.asp |title=nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200502090753.asp |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of such attacks, ethnic studies scholars are now faced with having to defend the field. In the media, this takes form of characterising the attack as right wing reactionary movement. For example, Orin Starn, a cultural anthropologist and specialist in Native American Studies at [[Duke University]], says: "The United States is a very diverse country, and an advocate would say we teach kids to understand multiculturalism and diversity, and these are tools that can be used in law, government, business and teaching, which are fields graduates go into. It promotes thinking about diversity, globalization, how we do business and how we work with nonprofits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2722200,00.html |title=denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~53~2722200,00.html |work=Denver Post |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515114123/http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0%2C1413%2C36~53~2722200%2C00.html |archivedate=May 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to criticisms that ethnic studies academics undermine the study of a unified American history and culture or that ethnic studies are simply a "colored" version of American Studies, defenders point out that ethnic studies come out of the historically repressed and denied presence of groups within the U.S. knowledge-production, literature and epistemology. Efforts to merge ethnic studies with American studies have been met with fierce opposition as was the case at UC Berkeley. While the field is already decades old, the ongoing creation of new ethnic studies departments is fraught with controversy. Administrators at Columbia University attempted to placate student protests for the creation of an Ethnic Studies Department in 1996 by offering American Studies as a compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E2D81E39F93AA25757C0A960958260 |title=nytimes.com |work=New York Times |date=April 19, 1996 |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arizona ban==

On May 11, 2010, Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] signed House Bill 2281 (also known as HB 2281 and A.R.S. §15–112), which prohibits a school district or charter school from including in its program of instruction any courses or classes that
#Promotes the overthrow of the Federal or state government or the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]
#Promotes resentment toward any race or class (e.g. racism and classism)
#Advocates ethnic solidarity instead of being individuals
#Are designed for a certain ethnicity
But the law must still allow:
#Native American classes to comply with federal law
#Grouping of classes based on academic performance
#Classes about the history of an ethnic group open to all students
#Classes discussing controversial history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf |title=Arizona House Bill 2281 (2010) |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming off the heels of SB 1070, [[Superintendent of Public Instruction]] Tom Horne was adamant about cutting [[Mexican-American Studies]] in the [[Tucson Unified School District]].  He devised HB 2281 under the belief that the program was teaching "destructive ethnic chauvinism and that Mexican American students are oppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Horne, [http://nau.edu/uploadedFiles/Academic/CAL/Philosophy/Forms/An%20Open%20Letter%20to%20Citizens%20of%20Tucson.pdf "An Open Letter to Citizens of Tucson"], June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2011, Horne reported TUSD to be out of compliance with the law.  In June of that year, the Arizona Education Department paid $110,000 to perform an audit on the [[Mexican American Studies Department Programs, Tucson Unified School District|TUSD's program]], which reported "no observable evidence was present to suggest that any classroom within the [[Tucson Unified School District]] is in direct violation of the law." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2011/06/16/20110616tucson-ethnic-studies-audit0616.html "Tucson ethnic-studies program not illegal, audit says"] The Arizona Republic, June 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Huppenthal]] (elected Superintendent as Horne became [[Attorney General]]) ordered the audit as part of his campaign promise to "Stop La Raza", but when the audit contradicted his own personal findings of noncompliance, he discredited it.  Despite a formal appeal issued on June 22, 2011 by TUSD to Huppenthal, Judge Lewis Kowal backed the Superintendent's decision and ruled the district out of compliance in December, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Billeaud|first=Jacques|title=Ariz schools' ethnic studies program ruled illegal|url=https://news.yahoo.com/ariz-schools-ethnic-studies-program-ruled-illegal-021635252.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 10, 2012 the TUSD board voted to cut the program after Huppenthal threatened to withhold 10% of the district's annual funding.  Numerous books related to the [[Mexican-American Studies]] program were found in violation of the law and have been stored in district storehouses, including Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', [[Paolo Freire]]'s ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', and Bill Bigelow's ''"Rethinking Columbus: The Next 500 Years''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2012/01/13/whos_afraid_of_the_tempest/ "Who's afraid of 'The Tempest'?"] Salon, January 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of MAS see HB 2281 as another attack on the Hispanic population of Arizona.  This is due partly to the fact that none of the other three ethnic studies programs were cut. Support for the ethnic studies programs subsequently came from scholars, community activist groups, etc. For example, The Curriculum Audit of the Mexican American Studies Department refuted all of the violations under House Bill 2281. The audit instead recommended that the courses be implemented further, given the positive impacts of the courses on the students. In addition to the defense of the ethnic studies department, the UN Charter of Human Rights challenges the bill as a violation of fundamental human, constitutional, and educational rights (Kunnie 2010). A 2011 documentary, [[Precious Knowledge]] directed by Ari Palos and produced by Eren McGinnis for Dos Vatos Productions, argues that while 48% of Hispanic students drop out, TUSD's program had become a model of national success, with 93% of enrolled students graduating and 85% going on to college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosvatos.com/films/PreciousKnowledge/more.php "Precious Knowledge"] Dos Vatos Films, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The film shows a 165-mile community run from Tucson to Phoenix in protest of the state's decision, as well as student-led marches and stand-ins. 
In one instance, students overtook a board meeting by chaining themselves to the board members' chairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/education/students-protest-ethnic-studies-curriculum-change-4-26-11 "Students Protest Ethnic Studies Curriculum Change"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821045758/http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/education/students-protest-ethnic-studies-curriculum-change-4-26-11 |date=August 21, 2011 }} MyFoxPhoenix.com, April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  A student protest group, UNIDOS (United Non-Discriminatory Individuals Demanding Our Studies), has remained active speaking out before legislators and school board members on behalf of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tucson12.nytimes-institute.com/12/tucson-school-board-eliminates-mexican-american-studies-program/ "Tucson School Board Eliminates Mexican American Studies Program"] New York Times Student Journalism Institute, January 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate case, two students and 11 teachers sued the state, contending that the law is unconstitutional.  The teachers, however, have been denied standing in the lawsuit as public employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/01/11/42963.htm "Students, Not Teachers, Can Fight Ban on Ethnic Studies"] Courthouse News Service, January 11, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appeal of Arizona Ban ===
The Mexican American Studies course was first brought under attack after the Deputy Superintendent of Public Education gave a speech to students, countering an allegation that "Republicans  hate Latinos."&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2015/07/07/13-15657.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The students walked out of the speech, and Tom Horne, the Superintendent, blamed the rudeness of the students on the teachers from their Mexican American Studies courses. He called for removal of the courses. When his call was not answered, he made an effort for a bill to be put into law banning Mexican American Studies courses.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

House Bill 2281,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited the Mexican American Studies courses, was approved in December 2010. In an effort to enforce the bill, the district court gave the Superintendent of the school district the right to withhold funding to schools that continue to teach the ethnic studies course.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2011/12/27/judge-upholds-ethnic-studies-decision-orders-money-withheld-from-tusd/|title=Judge upholds ethnic studies decision, orders money withheld from TUSD – Arizona Capitol Times|last=Grado|first=Gary|date=2011-12-27|website=azcapitoltimes.com|publisher=Arizona Capital Times|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Kowal ruled the course “biased, political, and emotionally charged,” and upheld both the bill and the withholding of funding from schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An appeal was filed in October 2010.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; The initial appeal was challenging House Bill 2281&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; for violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] (for viewpoint discrimination) and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (for void-for-vagueness) rights.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; This initial appeal was filed by 10 teachers, the director of the Mexican American Studies program, and 3 students and their parents.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Once the students graduated, 2 dropped their appeals, and the teachers and program director were dismissed for want of standing in January 2012.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; This left one student and her father on the appeal.

In March 2013, the appeals court ruled only in favor of the plaintiffs on the grounds that there was a First Amendment overbreadth violation to House Bill 2281.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; The plaintiffs decided to further appeal the case.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

On July 7, 2015, the appeal on the ban of the Mexican American Studies, "''Maya Arce vs Huppenthal''", reached a federal appeals court.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tonydiaz/discrimination-is-the-onl_b_7783704.html|title=Arizona Gets Schooled: Update on Ban of Mexican American Studies|last=Diaz|first=Tony|date=2015-08-11|website=The Huffington Post|publisher=Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overseen by Judge Rakoff, the court reversed part of what the district court had ruled on banning the course. Judge Rakoff looked at the 4 categories (listed above) that constitute which classes are prohibited.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Rakoff's statement said that House Bill 2281 was created with the Mexican American Studies course in mind.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Since the Mexican American studies course was the only course in Arizona to be banned, it became clear that the bill had targeted the one course. This led the court to find the bill to be partially unconstitutional as it did not require similar Mexican American Studies courses outside of the Tucson Unified School District to cease teaching the courses.

'''Half-Caste Act''' was the common name given to [[Acts of Parliament]] passed in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/missionvoices/help_and_resources/glossary/default.htm|title=Glossary|work=abc.net.au|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They became the model for legislation of Aboriginal communities throughout Australia, such as the [[Aboriginal Protection and restriction of the sale of opium act 1897]] in [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Liberman. The Decline of the Kuwarra People of Australia's Western Desert: A Case Study of Legally Secured Domination. Ethnohistory, Vol. 27, No. 2. (Spring, 1980), pp. 119-133. See page 121 in particular.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victoria==
The Victorian Half-Caste Act (in full, an ''Act to amend an Act entitled "An Act to Provide for the Protection and Management of the Aboriginal Natives of Victoria"'') was an extension and expansion of the [[Aboriginal Protection Act]] which gave extensive powers over the lives of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]] to the [[Aboriginal Protection Board|Board for the Protection of Aborigines]], including regulation of residence, employment and marriage.&lt;ref name=dd&gt;{{cite web

In particular, the 1886 act started to remove Aboriginal people of mixed descent, known as '[[half-caste]]s', from the Aboriginal stations or reserves to force them to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] into European society.  These expulsions separated families and communities, causing distress and leading to protest.  Nevertheless, the Board refused to assist the expelled people. It was assumed that the expulsions would lead to the decline in the population of the reserves and their eventual closure.

The failure of this policy and its inhumanity led to Victoria's ''Aborigines Act'' of 1910 and ''Aboriginal Lands Act'' of 1970, which abandoned this policy.&lt;ref name=dd/&gt;

==Western Australia==
[[Image:Last Executive Council WA.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Gov. Broome (seated centre) and the last Executive Council before responsible government in Western Australia, c.1890.]]

Before 1886 dealings with "natives" in Western Australia had been the responsibility of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Colonial Office]].{{dubious|date=May 2014}} In 1886 an Aboriginal Protection Board was established with five members and a secretary, all of whom were nominated by the Governor.

Following the furore over the Fairburn Report (which revealed [[slavery]] conditions among Aboriginal farm workers) and the work of the Rev. [[John Gribble]], Parliament introduced the Aborigines Protection Act 1886 (WA), or ''Half-caste act''.  This introduced employment contracts between employers and Aboriginal workers over the age of 14. There was no provision in the 1886 WA Act for contracts to include wages. But, employees were to be provided with "substantial, good and sufficient rations", clothing and blankets. The 1886 WA Act provided a [[resident magistrate]] with the power to indenture 'half-caste' and Aboriginal children, from a suitable age, until they turned 21. An Aboriginal Protection Board, was also established to prevent the abuses reported earlier, but rather than protect Aborigines, it mainly succeeded in putting them under tighter government control. It was intended to enforce contracts, employment of prisoners and apprenticeships, but there was not sufficient power to enforce clauses in the north, and they were openly flouted. The Act defined as "Aboriginal" "every Aboriginal native of Australia, every Aboriginal half-caste, or child of a half-caste". [[Frederick Broome|Governor Broome]] insisted that the act contain within it a clause permitting traditional owners to continue hunting on their tribal lands.

The effect of the Act was to give increasing power to the Board over Aboriginal people, rather than setting up a system to punish whites for wrongdoing in relation to Aboriginal people. An [[Aboriginal Department]] was set up, under the office of the [[Protector of Aborigines|Chief Protector of Aborigines]]. Nearly half of the Legislative Council voted to amend the act for contract labour as low as age 10 but it was defeated. [[McKenzie Grant]], the member for [[Electoral district of the North|The North]], claimed that child labour of age six or seven was a necessary commonplace, as "in this way they gradually become domesticated". The Attorney General [[Septimus Burt]], in debate on the 2nd reading speech, claimed that contracts were being issued, not for current work, but to hold Aboriginal people as slaves on stations for potential future work, and so prevent them from being free to leave.

==Aboriginal Protection Boards==
{{Main|Aboriginal Protection Board}}
Protectors of Aborigines were appointed by the Board under the conditions laid down in the various acts. In theory, Protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal people, dictate where Aboriginal people could live or work, and keep all wages earned by employed Aboriginals.

As the boards had limited funds Protectors received very limited remuneration, and so a range of people were appointed as local Protectors, including Resident Magistrates, Jail Wardens, Justices of the Peace and in some cases ministers of religion, though most were local Police Inspectors. The minutes of the board show they mostly dealt with matters of requests from religious bodies for financial relief and reports from Resident or Police Magistrates pertaining to trials and convictions of Aboriginal people under their jurisdiction.

Aboriginal protection boards also issued permits to allow Aboriginals the right to leave their respective missions and enter the mainstream society for a set period of time.

'''Henry Dodwell''' (October 1641{{snd}}7 June 1711) was an Anglo-Irish scholar, [[theology|theologian]] and controversial writer.

==Life==

Dodwell was born in [[Dublin]] in 1641. His father, William Dodwell, who lost his property in [[Connacht]] during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|Irish rebellion]],  was married to Elizabeth Slingsby, daughter of Sir [[Francis Slingsby]] and settled at [[York]] in 1648. Henry received his preliminary education at [[St Peter's School, York]].

In 1654 he was sent by his uncle to [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he became a scholar and fellow, receiving the Bachelor of Arts  in 1662 and Master of Arts in 1663. Having conscientious objections to taking [[Holy orders|religious orders]], he relinquished his fellowship in 1666, but in 1688 was elected [[Camden Professor of Ancient History|Camden professor of history]] at [[university of Oxford|Oxford]]. In 1691 he was deprived of his professorship for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Dodwell, Henry |volume=8 |page=374}}, endnotes:
*''The Works of H. D. ... abridg'd'' with an account of his life, by F Brokesby (2nd ed., 1723)
*[[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]], ''Diaries''&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodwell retired to [[Shottesbrooke]] in [[Berkshire]] to be near his friend, [[Francis Cherry (non-juror)|Francis Cherry]].  As the movement behind the [[nonjuring schism|refusal to swear allegiance]] declined, with the death of [[William Lloyd (bishop of Norwich)|William Lloyd]] who had been deprived of his bishopric, and the decision by [[Thomas Ken]] to relinquish his claim to the See of [[Diocese of Bath and Wells|Bath and Wells]], Dodwell returned to the Church of England in 1710.

He died in Shottesbrooke.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Works==

Living on the produce of a small estate in [[Ireland]], he devoted himself to the study of chronology and ecclesiastical polity, providing a defence of the deprived nonjuring bishops. [[Edward Gibbon]] speaks of his learning as "immense," and says that his "skill in employing facts is equal to his learning," although he severely criticizes his method and style. Dodwell's works on ecclesiastical polity are more numerous than those on chronology.

In his ecclesiastical writings he was regarded as one of the greatest champions of the [[Nonjuring schism|non-jurors]]; but the doctrine which he afterwards promulgated, that the soul is naturally mortal, and that immortality could be enjoyed only by those who had received [[baptism]] from the hands of one set of regularly ordained clergy, and was therefore a privilege from which dissenters were hopelessly excluded, did not strengthen his reputation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Bishop Burnet]] thus addresses him in one of his letters&amp;nbsp;: "You are a learned man&amp;nbsp;; and your life has been not only without blemish, but exemplary&amp;nbsp;; but you do not seem to remember, or enough to consider, the woe our Saviour has denounced against those by whom scandals come&amp;nbsp;; and, according to the true notion of scandal, I know no man, that has laid more in the way of the little ones, or weaker Christians, than you have done. I do assure you, I would rather wish that I could neither read nor write, than to have read or writ to such purposes as you have been pursuing now above thirty years. You seem to love novelties and paradoxes, and to employ your learning to support them. I do assure you, I have a just value for many valuable things that I know to be in you&amp;nbsp;; and do heartily lament every thing that is otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=George Godfrey|title=Lives of Eminent and Illustrious Englishmen, from Alfred the Great to the Latest Times on an Original Plan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wgyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA338|volume=4|year=1838|publisher=A.

==Dissertations upon Irenaeus==

Printed 1689 in Latin under the title of ''Dissertationes in Irenaeum''. These Dissertations are only a [[Wiktionary:prolegomena|prolegomena]] to what he farther designed, which was to show what the ancient heresies were, which disturbed the primitive Church, and what the foundation of them was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bayle|first1=Pierre|authorlink1=Pierre Bayle|last2=Bernard|first2=John Peter|authorlink2=John Peter Bernard|last3=Lockman|first3=John|authorlink3=John Lockman |author4=Thomas Birch |author5=George Sale|title=A general dictionary, historical and critical: in which a new and accurate translation of that of ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have at this day, certain most authentic ecclesiastical writers of the times, as Clemens Romanus, Barnabas, Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp, who wrote in the same order wherein I have named them, and after all the writers of the New Testament. But in Hermas you will not find one passage, or any mention of the New Testament, nor in all the rest is any one of the evangelists named. If sometimes they cite passages like those we read in our gospels, you will find them so changed, and for the most part so interpolated, that it cannot be known whether they produced them out of ours, or some apocryphal gospels. Nay, they sometimes cite passages which most certainly are not in our present gospels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodwell|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Dodwell|title=Dissertationes in Irenaeum.

==Family==

His eldest son [[Henry Dodwell (Religious controversialist)|Henry Dodwell]] was the author of a pamphlet entitled ''Christianity not founded on Argument'', to which a reply was published by his brother [[William Dodwell]] (1709–1785), who was concurrently engaged in a controversy with [[Conyers Middleton]] on the subject of miracles.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The pamphlet received many published replies at the time, and even as late as 1904 replies were still being made.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/cu31924031764917&lt;/ref&gt; Even the great [[Jonathan Swift]] was moved to write a reply against it.

'''Heredia''' ({{IPA-es|eˈɾeðja}}) is a city in the [[Heredia province]] of [[Costa Rica]], of which it is the capital; it is 10 kilometers to the north of the country's capital, [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].

The city is home to one of the largest colleges in Costa Rica, the [[National University of Costa Rica]], which accepts many international students.

== History ==
[[File:Escuela Republica de Argentina.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Cultural centre "Escuela República de Argentina"]]
Prior to its founding, the area around Heredia was inhabited by the native tribe that is known as the [[Huetares]], who were commanded at the coming of the Spanish by the ''[[Cacique]]'' [[Garavito]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heredia.go.cr/en/the-city History]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1706 settlers from [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]], set up a small church at a place they called "Alvirilla", which soon became more populated. Between 1716 and 1717 the settlers moved their village to the north, to a place the Indians called '''Cubujuquí'''. In 1736 Heredia was deemed sufficiently large to be granted its own parish, and the first incarnation of the Iglesia de la Inmaculada was built to serve as its parish church. In 1751, the [[Bishop of Nicaragua and Costa Rica]], Monseñor [[Pedro Agustín Morel de Santa Cruz]] supervised the founding of the first school in Heredia, which was run by the church. This school is now known as the [[Liceo de Heredia]]. In 1763 the town was promoted to the status of ''[[Villa]]''; it was later renamed Heredia in honor of the President of the [[Real Audiencia of Guatemala]] who had conferred the status, don [[Alonso Fernández de Heredia]]. During the 18th century the area around Heredia was developed, with the founding [[Barva]] and other towns. On October 31, 1796, Padre Felix de Alvarado laid the foundation stone for the rebuilding of the [[Iglesia de la Inmaculada]]. The Municipality of Heredia was founded on 19 May 1812, and in 1824, Heredia was promoted to city by [[Juan Rafael Mora]], the first President of the Republic. The 1848 constitution made Heredia the capital of [[Heredia Province]], promoted it to ''cantón'',  and assigned it seven parishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heredia.go.cr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32&amp;Itemid=6 Municipal Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a brief period in the 1830s, Heredia served as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of Costa Rica.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">The '''historian's fallacy''' is an [[informal fallacy]] that occurs when one assumes that decision makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and having the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision. It is not to be confused with [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], a mode of historical analysis in which present-day ideas (such as moral standards) are projected into the past.

The idea that a critic can make erroneous interpretations of past works because of knowledge of subsequent events was first articulated by British literary critic [[Matthew Arnold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Arp|editor1-first=Robert|title=1001 Ideas That Changed the Way We Think|date=2013|publisher=[[Atria Books]]|isbn=978-1476705729|page=555|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oY6YAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA555&amp;lpg=PA555&amp;&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Zfg04KQ9i&amp;sig=mGc3nWY-baGe1h3oPIZ1m9Wy9tE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fK3gVKKSHIGAUfD4gpAI&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=S. N. Radhika Lakshmi|title=Matthew Arnold as a Literary Critic|url=http://www.literature-study-online.com/essays/arnold.html|website=Literature-Study-Online|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1880 essay ''The Study of Poetry'', Arnold wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew Arnold|title=The Study of Poetry|url=http://www.bartleby.com/28/5.html|website=Bartleby|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The course of development of a nation’s language, thought, and poetry, is profoundly interesting; and by regarding a poet’s work as a stage in this course of development we may easily bring ourselves to make it of more importance as poetry than in itself it really is, we may come to use a language of quite exaggerated praise in criticising it; in short, to overrate it. So arises in our poetic judgments the fallacy caused by the estimate which we may call historic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of the historian's fallacy was named and outlined in 1970 by [[David Hackett Fischer]], who suggested it was analogous to [[William James]]'s [[psychologist's fallacy]]. Fischer did not suggest that historians should refrain from retrospective analysis in their work, but he reminded historians that their subjects were not able to see into the future. As an example, he cited the well-known argument that Japan's surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] should have been predictable in the United States because of the many indications that an attack was imminent. What this argument overlooks, says Fischer, citing the work of [[Roberta Wohlstetter]], is that there were innumerable conflicting signs which suggested possibilities other than an attack on Pearl Harbor. Only in retrospect do the warning signs seem obvious; signs which pointed in other directions tend to be forgotten. (See also: [[hindsight bias]].)

In the field of [[military history]], historians sometimes use what is known as the "[[fog of war]] technique" in hopes of avoiding the historian's fallacy. In this approach, the actions and decisions of the historical subject (such as a military commander) are evaluated primarily on the basis of what that person knew at the time, and not on future developments that the person could not have known. According to Fischer, this technique was pioneered by the American historian [[Douglas Southall Freeman]] in his influential biographies of [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[George Washington]].

{{History of Punjab}}
{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
{{Punjabis}}
The '''History of [[Punjab]]''' is intertwined with the history of the broader [[Indian subcontinent]] and the surrounding regions of [[South Asia]], [[Central Asia]] and [[West Asia]]. Historically known as [[Sapta Sindhu]], or the ''Land of Seven Rivers'', the name Punjab was given by later [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]]. 

Ancient Punjab region was the primary geographical extent of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], which was notable for advanced technologies and amenities that the people of the region had used. The region was historically a [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] region, known for its high activity of scholarship, technology, and arts. Intermittent wars between various kingdoms was characteristic of this time, except in times of temporary unification under centralised [[List of Indian monarchs|Indian Empires]] or invading powers.

After the arrival of Islamic invaders, that had managed to rule throughout a long period of the region's history, much of [[Western Punjab]] had become a centre of [[Islamic culture]] in the Indian subcontinent. An interlude of [[Sikh]] rule under the Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] and his [[Sikh Empire]] had seen a brief resurfacing of traditional culture until the British had annexed the region into their larger [[British Empire]]. After the British had left, the region was partitioned into a Hindu-Sikh majority area that would go to the secular state of India, and a Muslim majority area that would go to the Islamic state of Pakistan to prevent conflict.

==Vedic Era==
===Indus Valley Civilisation===
{{Main|Indus Valley Civilisation}}
Punjab in ancient times was known as the ''Sapt-Sindhava'', or ''land of the seven rivers''. The name ''Punjab'' was given by later Islamic invaders. The aforementioned seven rivers were the Vitsta and Vitamasa ([[Jhelum River|Jhelum]]), Asikni ([[Chenab River|Chenab]]), Parusni and Iravati ([[Ravi River|Ravi]]), Vipasa ([[Beas River|Beas]]), and the Satudri ([[Sutlej]]).{{cn|date=May 2018}}

It is believed by most scholars{{who|date=May 2018}} that the earliest trace of human habitation in India traces to the [[Soan valley]] between the [[Indus]] and the Jhelum rivers. This period goes back to the first inter-glacial period in the [[Cryogenian|second Ice Age]], from which remnants of stone and flint tools have been found.{{sfn|Singh|1989|p=1}}

[[File:View of Granary and Great Hall on Mound F.JPG|thumb|left|A view of [[Harappa]]'s Granary and Great Hall, ca. 2600–1500 BCE.]]
Punjab and the surrounding areas are the location of the ruins of the Indus Valley Civilisation, also known as the Harappan Civilisation. There are ruins of cities, thousands of years old,{{clarify|do we mean the ruins are 1000s of years old or the cities were 1000s old before becoming ruins?|date=May 2018}} found in these areas with the most notable being those of [[Harappa]],  [[Rakhigarhi]] and [[Rupar]]. Besides the aforementioned sites, hundreds of ancient settlements have been found throughout the region, spanning an area of about 100 miles. These ancient towns and cities had advanced features such as city-planning, brick-built houses, sewage and draining systems, as well as public baths. The people of the Indus Valley also developed a writing system, that has to this day not been deciphered.{{sfn|Singh|1989|pages=2—3}}

===Vedic descriptions===
Literary evidence from the [[Vedic civilisation|Vedic era]] suggests a transition from early small [[List of Rigvedic tribes|janas]], or tribes, to many Janapadas (territorial civilisations) and [[gaṇa sangha|gaṇa sangha societies]]. The latter are loosely translated to being [[oligarchy|oligarchies]] or republics.  These political entities were represented from the ''[[Rig Veda]]'' to the ''[[Astadhyayi]]'' by [[Pāṇini|Panini]]. Archaeologically, the time span of these entities corresponds to phases also present in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Indo-Gangetic divide]] and the upper Gangetic basin.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2003|p=55}}

Some of the early Janas of the ''Rig Veda'' can be strongly attributed to Punjab. Although their distribution patterns are not satisfactorily ascertainable, they are associated with the Porusni, Asikni, Satudri, Vipas, and Saraswati. The rivers of Punjab often corresponded to the eastern Janapadas. ''Rig Vedic'' Janas such as the Druhyus, Anus, Purus, Yadus, Turvasas, Bharatas, and others were associated in Punjab and the Indo-Gangetic plain. Other ''Rig Vedic'' Janapadas such as the Pakhthas, Bhalanasas, Visanins, and Sivas were associated with areas in the north and west of Punjab.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2003|p=55}}

[[File:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|A map of India during the Vedic period, including the Punjab region.]]
An important event of the ''Rig Vedic'' era was the "[[Battle of Ten Kings]]" which was fought on the banks of the river Parusni (identified with the present-day Ravi river) between king Sudas of the Trtsu lineage of the [[Bhāratas|Bharata]] clan on the one hand and a confederation of ten tribes on the other. The ten tribes pitted against Sudas comprised five major tribes: the Purus, the Druhyus, the Anus, the Turvasas and the Yadus; in addition to five minor ones: the Pakthas, the Alinas, the Bhalanas, the Visanins and the Sivas. Sudas was supported by the Vedic [[Rishi]] [[Vasishtha]], while his former Purohita, the Rishi [[Viswamitra]], sided with the confederation of ten tribes.{{sfn | Frawley | 2000 | p=118}} Sudas had earlier defeated Samvaran and ousted him from Hastinapur. It was only after the death of Sudas that Samvaran could return to his kingdom.{{sfn|Singh|1989|p=4}}

A second battle, referred to as the Mahabharat in ancient texts, was fought in Punjab on a battlefield known as [[Kurukshetra]]. This was fought between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Duryodhana, a descendant of Kuru (who was the son of king Samvaran), had tried to insult the Panchali princess Draupadi in revenge for defeating his ancestor Samvaran.{{sfn|Singh|1989|p=4}}

Many Janapadas were mentioned from Vedic texts and are confirmed by Ancient Greek historical sources. Most of the Janapadas that had exerted large territorial influence, or Mahajanapadas, had been raised in the Indo-Gangetic plain with the exception of Gandhara in modern-day Afghanistan. There was a large level of contact between all the Janapadas of ancient India with descriptions being given of trading caravans, movement of students from universities, and itineraries of princes.{{sfn|Chattopadhyaya|2003|pages=56—57}}

Pre-Islamic Punjab was also a centre of learning for Ancient India, and many [[ashram]]s and universities. The most notable of the universities is that at [[Taxila]] (also referred to as Takhsh-Shila), which was dedicated to the study of the "three Vedas and 18 branches of knowledge".{{clarify|reason=who says this?|date=May 2018}} In its heyday, it had attracted students from all over India as well as those from surrounding countries.{{sfn|Singh|1989|p=4}}

==Mauryan Era==
===Alexander's invasion===
After overrunning the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]], [[Alexander the Great]] turned his sights to India. This was the first time he moved beyond the limits of the [[Persian Empire]]. Alexander sent heralds ahead of him to the native rulers on the west side of the Indus and divided his army into two. He led one wing himself, and the other was commanded by [[Hephastion]]. Alexander took his troops and razed several cities, fought a battle at [[Massaka]] which turned into a massacre, and conducted the battle at [[Aornos]] rock. Somewhere in this region, Alexander visited a city called [[Nysa (city visited by Alexander the Great)|Nysa]] which was in legend founded by a god.{{sfn|Romm|2012|p=375}} After crossing the Indus, Alexander was welcomed by the native ruler of Takshashila, known to the Greeks as Taxila, and other allies. [[Onesikritos]] was sent to interview the native ascetics about their way of life, but the conversation was rumoured to be difficult as the Greeks had to use three different levels of interpreters. Alexander was nevertheless impressed enough to bring an Indian philosopher whom the Greeks called [[Kalanos]]. Another Indian philosopher was asked also but had refused to come.  When Alexander had reached [[Malloi]] and [[Oxydrakai]] in 325 B.C, the people had claimed that they always lived freely, directly contradicting with Persian accounts of rule over the region. After this, Alexander's first opponent was the Raja [[Porus]]. Porus and Taxiles were longtime enemies, and the latter saw Alexander's arrival as a way to settle old scores.{{sfn|Romm|2012|p=376}}

Porus and Alexander had fought a battle on the Hydaspes, which was the last major battle of Alexander's campaign. The armies had met in June, when the monsoon had begun, and it was the first time Alexander and his troops had encountered Elephants in battle. After the defeat of Porus in Greek sources, most armies that he had encountered had come to submit, with very few refusing to do so such as the people of Sangala who were massacred.{{sfn|Romm|2012|p=377}}Supposedly after the disheartened and homesick attitude of his troops, Alexander had returned home through Malois.{{sfn|Singh|1989|p=4}} On his return, Alexander had conquered many resisting Indian janas and Janapadas, and those who had refused were killed. Many [[Brahman]]s were noted to be executed by Alexander, much to the shock of the Indians. Nevertheless, Alexander made little effort to retain the land he had conquered.{{sfn|Romm|2012|pages=375—377}}

===Maurya Empire===
{{main|Maurya Empire}}
[[File:Mauryan Empire ca. 265 BCE.png|thumb|The Mauryan Empire around 265 BCE. Prior to Alexander's invasion, much of the region was ruled by the Mahajanapada of the [[Nanda Empire]] as well as other smaller Janapadas.]]
[[Chandragupta Maurya]], with the aid of [[Kautilya]], had established his empire around 320 B.C. The early life of Chandragupta Maurya is not clear. Kautilya enrolled the young Chandragupta in the university at Taxila to educate him in the arts, sciences, logic, mathematics, warfare, and administration. With the help of the small Janapadas of Punjab and Sindh, he had gone on to conquer much of the North West.{{sfn|Thorpe|Thorpe|2009|p=33}}{{clarify|reason=northwest of what? India? Punjab?|date=May 2018}} He then defeated the Nanda rulers in [[Pataliputra]] to capture the throne. Chandragupta Maurya fought Alexander's successor in the east, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] when the latter invaded. In a peace treaty, Seleucus ceded all territories west of the Indus and offered a marriage, including a portion of [[Bactria]], while Chandragupta granted Seleucus 500 elephants.{{sfn|Thorpe|Thorpe|2009|p=33}}

Chandragupta's rule was very well organised. The Mauryans had an autocratic and centralised administration system, aided by a council of ministers, and also a well-established espionage system. Much of Chandragupta's success is attributed to [[Chanakya]], the author of the ''[[Arthashastra]]''. Much of the Mauryan rule had a strong bureaucracy that had regulated tax collection, trade and commerce, industrial activities, mining, statistics and data, maintenance of public places, and upkeep of temples.{{sfn|Thorpe|Thorpe|2009|p=33}}

Mauryan rule was advanced for its time, and foreign accounts of Indian cities mention many temples, libraries, universities, gardens, and parks. A notable account was that of the Greek ambassador [[Megasthenes]] who had visited the Mauryan capital of Pataliputra.{{sfn|Thorpe|Thorpe|2009|p=33}}

The assassination of the last Mauryan emperor by the general [[Pushyamitra]] did not end in the break up of Mauryan rule entirely. Some of the eastern provinces, such as that of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], were quick to assert independence. Punjab and much of the Indo-Gangetic plain were still under the hold of Pushyamitra's empire as well as under the subsequent smaller offshoots that had asserted its claim over the region.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Golden Age==
[[File:Map for Gupta Empire and tributaries.svg|thumb|right|The [[Gupta Empire]] at its maximum extent. The Gupta Empire ruled during a period known as India's Golden age.]]

===Gupta Empire===
The origins of the [[Gupta Empire]] are believed to be from local Rajas as only the father and grandfather of Chandra Gupta are mentioned in inscriptions. Chandra Gupta's reign was an unsettled one, but under his son, [[Samudra Gupta]], the empire reached supremacy over India roughly similar to the proportions that the Maurya Empire had exercised before. Various records exist of Samudra Gupta's conquest, showing that nearly all of North India and a portion of Southern India had been under Gupta rule.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The Empire was organised along the lines of provinces, frontier feudatories, and subordinate kings of [[vassal state]]s that had sworn fealty to the Empire. In the case of Punjab, the local Janapadas were semi-independent but were expected to obey orders and pay homage to the empire.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Samudra Gupta was regarded as a patron of the arts and humanities. Inscriptions give evidence to the Raja not only being a learned man, but one fond of the company of poets and writers; one type of coinage even shows him playing on the [[veena]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Samudra Gupta was succeeded by his son Rama Gupta in whose time the [[Scythian]]s, known as the [[Saka]]s, had begun to be recognised as a threat. Rama Gupta had attempted to pay off the Sakas, but this had cost him his throne. Usurped by Chandra Gupta II, the new emperor had begun to consolidate the power of the empire where traces of disruption had presented himself. Chandra Gupta II had gone on to defeat the Sakas, earning him the name ''Sakari Chandra Gupta''. By this time the Empire still ruled over much of North India, but the authority in the South seemed to lapse.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Although the main achievement for which Chandra Gupta II is known is the victory over invaders, he was described as devoted to the arts of peace. Chandra Gupta II was an ardent worshipper of [[Vishnu]], and was a patron of the revival of Puranic Hinduism——a movement that had revived and redefined Hinduism——displacing much of Buddhist influence within the period of a century. Under the Gupta court at this time the arts, sciences, and literature had flourished.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The 200 years of Gupta rule are said to be the climax of Hindu Imperial tradition. From the context of literature, art, religion, science, commerce, and architecture, the period under Gupta rule had prospered. The Mauryan bureaucracy, already converted to caste, had functioned with impartial loyalty throughout the Empire and surrounding areas. The Empire was organised in similar lines to that of the Mauryan Empire, and had a system of viceroys, governors, administrators, and ministers. Seals of police chiefs, military suppliers, and chief justices give further insight into the administration of the Guptas.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The empire was also known for its art and architecture, characterised by the reduction of the foreign influence of the Greeks and [[Kushan]]s, and re-assertion of Hindu art. The Gupta period was also the classical age of Sanskrit literature. Much of the original ancient Hindu texts from before the Gupta Empire are lost, but the current iterations of Sanskrit works such as that of the ''Mahabharata'' and ''Bhagvad Gita'' are from the editions of this time.{{cn|date=May 2018}} The complete re-writing of the Hindu texts raised the question of why the writers of the period would do this. A historian claims{{who|date=May 2018}} that this was due to the foreign influence that was present due to previous invaders, and a re-writing was required for the re-assertion of the original ideals.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Another feature of the Gupta rule was the development of Indian science. The early development of the decimal system with respect to zero, the heliocentric model, accurate calculations of the duration of a day, reasons behind eclipses, and advances in the natural sciences were all achievements from this period. Major scholars from this time included Aryabhata and Varahamhira.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], who initially were part of the predominantly Buddhist [[Hephthalites|Hephthalite]] group, established themselves in [[Afghanistan]] by the first half of the 5th century, with their capital at [[Bamyan City|Bamiyan]]. The Huns invaded the Gupta Empire under Kumara Gupta (r.415-455). Kumara Gupta had just earlier defeated several revolts from the Pushyamitras, a tribe of central India.  After the death of Kumaragupta in 467, the Huns renewed their attacks and managed to invade border provinces around this time.{{sfn |Daniélou|2003|pages=Ch.10}} Kumara Gupta's son Skanda Gupta had managed to defeat further Hun invasions. Skanda Gupta managed to defeat the Huns in such a manner that they were fully routed; the consequences of the Gupta victory over the Huns were far-reaching, leading a historian to believe that this was likely the reason for the Hun invasions further West.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

After the death of Skanda Gupta, the Empire suffered from various wars of succession. The last major Gupta King was Buddha Gupta; after him, the Empire had split into various branches across India. Nevertheless, by the sixth century, the Huns had established themselves and Toramana and his son Mihirakula, who has been described to be a Saivite Hindu, had ruled over the approximate areas of Punjab, [[Rajasthan|Rajputana]], and Kashmir. Several accounts, including those by Chinese pilgrims, make reference to the cruelty of the Huns. There had been several alliances throughout this time that had checked the advance of the Huns, but it was not until 533-534 that Raja Yashovarman of Mandasor firmly defeated them.{{sfn |Daniélou|2003|pages=Ch.10}}

===Empire of Harsha===
{{Main|Harsha}}
After the disintegration of the Gupta Empire, Northern India was ruled by several independent kingdoms which carried on the traditions of the Gupta Empire within their own territories.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Harshavardhana, commonly called Harsha, was an [[India]]n emperor who ruled northern India from 606 to 647 from his capital [[Kanauj]]. Harsha's grandfather was Adityavardhana, a feudatory ruler of Thanesvar in eastern Punjab. Under his son Prabhakarvardhana, the dynasty emerged as a major state which was constantly at odds with the Huns and the nearby rulers of Malwa. Harsha was his nephew, and sought to conquer all of the country; at the height of his power, his kingdom spanned the entirety of [[Northern India]]. Harsha was defeated by the south Indian Emperor [[Pulakeshin II]] of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] when Harsha tried to expand his Empire into southern peninsula of India.{{sfn | Majumdar | 1977 | p=274}}

==Islamic Invasions==
===Early Islamic Invasions===
Arab armies had earlier tried to penetrate deep into South Asia but were defeated by the South Indian Emperor [[Vikramaditya II]] of the [[Chalukya dynasty]], South Indian general Dantidurga of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]] in Gujarat, and by Nagabhata of the [[Pratihara]] Dynasty in [[Malwa]] in the early 8th century.{{sfn|Jayapalan|2001|p=152}}{{sfn | Mani | 2005 | p=16}} Despite repeated campaigns, in 698 and 700, Arabs also failed to occupy the Kandahar-Ghazni-Kabul route to the Khyber Pass. Two small Hindu states of Zabul and Kabul in southern Afghanistan stubbornly defended this strategic area between the river Sindh and Koh Hindu Kush.{{sfn | Wink | 2002 | pages=121—123}}

A Brahmin dynasty, more commonly known as the [[Hindu Shahi]]s, was ruling from Kabul and later Waihind, another Brahmin dynasty ruled in Punjab.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} During this period a Turkic kingdom was established Ghazni and Sabuktagin ascended its throne in 977. The kingdom had rapidly conquered nearby kingdoms, and also conquered the Shahi capital of Kabul. Alarmed by the rapid expansion of the Ghaznavids, the Hindu Shahi kingdom twice attacked Sabuktagin but failed in his objective.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Gradually, Sabuktagin conquered all Shahi territories in Afghanistan, north of the Khyber Pass. He died in 997 and was succeeded by his son Mahmud after a brief war of succession among the brothers. {{sfn | Digby | 1976 | p=453}}

Bhima Deva Shahi was the fourth king of the Hindu [[Kabul Shahis]]. As a devout Brahmin, in his old age, he committed ritual suicide in his capital town of Waihind, located on the right side of river Sindh, fourteen miles above Attock.{{sfn|Mohan |2010| pages=170—172}} As Bhimadeva had no male heir, Jayapala succeeded the Shahi throne, which had included areas spanning from Punjab to Kabul in Afghanistan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Jayapala was defeated at [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|Peshawar]] by Mahmud of Ghazni and the Shahis lost all territory north of river Sindh.{{sfn|Barua|2006|p=25}} Anandapala and Trilochanapala, his son and grandson respectively, resisted Mahmud for another quarter of a century but Punjab was finally annexed to the Sultanate of Ghazni, around 1021.{{sfn|Mohan|2010|pages=120—153}} After the Muslim attacks, many Punjabi scholars of Sanskrit had fled to schools and universities in Benares and Kashmir, which were at the time unaffected by Islamic invasion. Al Biruni wrote: "Hindu sciences have fled far away from those parts of the country that have been conquered by us, and fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, to Benares, and other places." These places were later to face the same depredations.{{sfn | Scharfe | 2002 | p=178}}

===Delhi Sultanate===
{{Main|Delhi Sultanate|}}
[[File:East entrace domed ceiling, Quwwat ul-Islam Mosque.jpg|thumb|The east entrance domed ceiling of Quwwat ul-Islam Mosque is one of the architectural relics left behind from the reign of the Delhi Sultanates. Note the pillars, which were taken from Hindu temples and used for the construction of the Mosque.]]
In the late 12th century, Muhammad of Ghori began a systematic invasion of India. Between 1175 and 1192, the Ghurid dynasty had occupied the cities of Uch, Multan, Peshawar, Lahore, and Delhi. In 1206, the Ghurid general Qutb-al-din Aybeg and his successor Iltutmish founded the first of the series of Delhi Sultanates. Each dynasty would be an alternation of various inner-Asian military lords and their clients, constantly vying for power. These sultanates would make Delhi a safe haven for Muslim Turks and Persians who would flee the eventual Mongol invasions.{{sfn | Lapidus | 2014 | p=391}}

The Khalji dynasty was the second dynasty of the Delhi sultanates, ruling from 1290 to 1320. This dynasty was a short-lived one, and extended Islamic rule to Gujarat, Rajasthan, the Deccan, and parts of Southern India. The Khalji dynasty reworked the tax system in India. Previously, the ruler would assign village locals to collect a share of the peasant's produce, using it to pay the soldiers and administrators. In 1300, Ala-al-din Khalji demanded that peasants pay one half of their produce, abolished the authority of local chiefs, and deprived the local lords of their power.{{sfn| Lapidus | 2014 | pages=391—392}}

If the Delhi Sultanate, an offshoot of the Islamic conquest, was to rule over India, it was necessary for there to be the cultural and ideological integration of the people. This effort of integration and cohesion took time to develop. The first gesture to bring the people into Islam was to destroy major Hindu temples. This was done to loot riches and to signify the defeat of the Hindu rulers and their gods. Sometimes these destroyed temples were replaced by Mosques in order to show victory to both Hindus and rival Muslims. {{sfn | Lapidus | 2014 | p=393}} Examples are the mosque of Quwwat-al-Islam which incorporated stones and iron pillars from Hindu structures, and the Qutb Minar, which highlighted the presence of Islam. The dynasties of the Delhi sultanates stressed allegiance to the Caliphate and supported the judicial authority of the Ulama.{{sfn | Lapidus | 2014 | p=393}}

The Khalji dynasty was succeeded by the Tughluq dynasty, which had ruled from 1320 to 1413. Muhammad bin Tughluq was supported by Turkic warriors, and was the first to introduce non-Muslims into the administration, to participate in local festivals, and permit the construction of Hindu temples. To maintain his identity as a Muslim, the Muhammad bin Tughluq adhered to Islamic laws, swore allegiance to the caliph in Cairo, appointed Ulamas, and imposed the tax on non-Muslims. The Tughluq dynasty, however, disintegrated rapidly due to revolts by governors, resistance from locals, and the re-formation of independent Hindu kingdoms. {{sfn | Lapidus | 2014 | p=394}} The rule of the Delhi sultanates around this time was based upon Iranian-Muslim tradition. According to Barani, a Tughluq administrator in around 1360, the ruler must "follow the teachings of the Prophet, enforce Islamic law, suppress rebellions, punish heretics, subordinate nonbelievers, and protect the weak against the strong". The Islamic values that were idealised by the Delhi sultanates were ones that brought men in accordance with God's command by cultivating moral values in the governing authorities. {{sfn | Lapidus | 2014 | p=394}}

After the death of the last Tughluq ruler Nasir-ud-din Mahmud, the nobles are believed to have chosen Daulat Khan Lodi for the throne. In 1414, Lodi was defeated by Khizr Khan, the founder of the Sayyid dynasty of the Sultanate. Khizr Khan professor to rule as the viceroy of [[Timur]] and his successor Shah Rukh. Under the Sayyid dynasty, Punjab, Dipalpur, and parts of Sindh had come under the rule of the Sultanates.{{sfn | Jayapalan | 2001 | p=53}} During this time, various regions such as Bengal, Deccan, Malwa, and others had gained independence from the Sultanate. The rule of the Sayyid dynasty was characterised by frequent revolts by the Hindus of the various Punjabi doabs.{{sfn | Jayapalan | 2001 | p=53}} The rule of the Sayyids experienced another revolt under the rule of their general Bahlul Lodi, who had at first occupied much of Punjab, yet failed to capture Delhi. In his second attempt, Bahlul Lodi captured Delhi and founded the Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi sultanates. {{sfn | Jayapalan | 2001 | p=54}} The Lodi dynasty reached its peak under Bahlul's grandson Sikander Lodi. Various road and irrigation projects were taken under his rule, and the rule had patronised Persian culture. Despite this, there was still persecution of the local Hindu people as many temples, such as that of Mathura, were destroyed and had a system of widespread discrimination against Hindus.{{sfn | Jayapalan | 2001 | p=56}} The rule of the last Lodi emperor was a weak one, and was eclipsed by the arrival of Babur's army. {{sfn | Jayapalan | 2001 | p=57}}

===Mughal Empire===
{{Main|Mughal Empire}}
[[File:Alamgiri Gate.jpg|thumb|The [[Lahore Fort]] is one of the most famous landmarks left behind from the empire]]
In 1526, [[Babur]], a [[Timurid Dynasty|Timurid]] descendant of [[Timur]] and [[Descent from Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]] from the [[Fergana Valley]] (modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]) was ousted from his ancestral domain in Central Asia. Bābur turned to India and crossed the Khyber Pass.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/mughals/ The Islamic World to 1600: Rise of the Great Islamic Empires (The Mughal Empire)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121217/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/empires/mughals/ |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From his base in Afghanistan, he was able to secure control of Punjab, and in 1526 he decisively defeated the forces of the Delhi sultan Ibrāhīm Lodī at the First Battle of Panipat. The next year, he defeated the Rajput confederacy under Rana Sanga of Mewar, and in 1529 defeated the remnants of the Delhi sultanates. At his death in 1530 the Mughal Empire encompassed almost all of Northern India.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mughal Dynasty|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mughal-dynasty|website=Encylcopaedia Britannica|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bābur’s son Humāyūn (reigned 1530–40 and 1555–56) had lost territory to rebels, but Humāyūn’s son Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) defeated the Hindu king Hemu at the Second Battle of Panipat (1556) and reestablished Mughal rule. Akbar's son Jahangir had furthered the size of the Mughal Empire through conquest, yet left much of the state bankrupt as a result. Jahangir's son Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–1658) was known for his monuments, including the Taj Mahal. Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb was especially known for his religious intolerance and was known for his destruction of schools and temples which he saw as un-Islamic. In addition to the murder of a Sikh Guru, Aurangzeb had instilled heavy taxes on Hindus and Sikhs that had later led to an economic depression.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;{{sfn | Seiple | 2013 | p=96}}&lt;ref name=bbcgtb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/people/teghbahadur.shtml|title=Religions - Sikhism: Guru Tegh Bahadur|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn | Singh | Fenech |2016 | pages=236—238}}{{sfn | Fenech | 2001 | pages=20—31, 623-642}}{{sfn | McLeod | 1999 | pages=155—165}}

During the reign of Muḥammad Shah (1719–48), the empire began to decline, accelerated by warfare and rivalries, and. After the death of Muḥammad Shah in 1748, the Marathas attacked and ruled almost all of northern India. Mughal rule was reduced to only a small area around Delhi, which passed under Maratha (1785) and the British (1803) control. The last Mughal, Bahādur Shah II (reigned 1837–57), was exiled to Burma by the British.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

====Mughal conflicts with Sikhs====
The Sikh religion began around the time of the conquest of Northern India by [[Babur]] Shah, the founder of the Mughal Empire.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The later Muslim Emperor [[Jahangir]], however, saw the Sikhs as a political threat. He ordered [[Guru Arjun Dev]] to be put to death after he had refused to change the passage about Islam in the [[Adi Granth]]. When the Guru refused, Jahangir ordered him to be put to death by torture.{{sfn | Melton | 2014 | p=1163}}  Guru Arjan Dev's death led to the sixth Guru [[Guru Hargobind]] to declare sovereignty in the creation of the [[Akal Takht]] and the establishment of a fort to defend [[Amritsar]]. Jahangir then jailed Guru Hargobind at [[Gwalior]], but released him after a number of years when he no longer felt threatened. The succeeding son of Jahangir, [[Shah Jahan]], took offence at Guru Hargobind's declaration and after a series of assaults on Amritsar, forced the Sikhs to retreat to the [[Sivalik Hills]].{{sfn | Jestice | 2004 | pp=345—346}} The ninth Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]], moved the Sikh community to [[Anandpur Sahib|Anandpur]] and travelled extensively to visit and preach in defiance of Aurangzeb, who attempted to install [[Ramraiya|Ram Rai]] as new guru. Guru Tegh Bahadur aided [[Kashmiri Pandits]] in avoiding conversion to [[Islam]] and was arrested by Aurangzeb. When offered a choice between conversion to Islam and death, he chose to die rather than compromise his principles and was executed.{{sfn|Johar|1975|pages=192—210}}{{full|date=May 2018}} [[Guru Gobind Singh]] assumed the guruship in 1675 and established the [[Khalsa]], a collective army of baptised Sikhs, on 30 March 1699. The establishment of the Khalsa united the Sikh community against various Mughal-backed claimants to the guruship.{{sfn|Jestice|2004|pages=312—313}}

Banda Singh Bahadur (also known as ''Lachman Das'', ''Lachman Dev'' and ''Madho Das''), (1670–1716) met Guru Gobind Singh at Nanded and adopted the Sikh religion. A short time before his death, Guru Gobind Singh ordered him to conquer Punjab and gave him a letter that commanded all Sikhs to join him. After two years of gaining supporters, Banda Singh Bahadur initiated an agrarian uprising by breaking up the large estates of [[Zamindar#Mughal Era|Zamindar families]] and distributing the land to the peasants.{{sfn|Singh|2008 |pages=25—26}}{{full|date=May 2018}} During the rebellion, Banda Singh Bahadur made it a point to destroy the cities in which the Muslims had been cruel to the supporters of Guru Gobind Singh. He executed Wazir Khan in revenge for the deaths of Guru Gobind Singh's sons  after the Sikh victory at [[Sirhind]].{{sfn|Nesbitt |2016 |page=61}}{{full|date=May 2018}} He ruled the territory between the [[Sutlej river]] and the [[Yamuna river]], established a capital in the [[Himalayas]] at [[Lohgarh (Bilaspur)|Lohgarh]] and struck [[coin]]age in the names of [[Guru Nanak]] and Guru Gobind Singh.{{sfn|Singh|2008 |pages=25—26}} In 1716, he was defeated by the Mughals at his fort at Gurdas Nangal. The captured Sikhs were beheaded, their heads stuffed with hay, mounted on spears and carried on a procession to Delhi en route to the Qutb Minar. Banda Singh was told to dismount, as the Muslims placed his child in his arms and bade him to kill it. The child was ripped open and fed to him, as the Muslims had dismembered his limbs after refusing to convert to [[Islam]].{{sfn | Bhaṅgū | Singh | Singh | 2006 | p=415}}{{sfn | Dhanoa | 2005 | p=89}}

===Durranis and Marathas===
{{Main|Durrani Empire|Maratha conquest of North-west India|Sikh holocaust of 1762}}
In 1747, the ''Durrani kingdom'' was established by the [[Pashtuns|Pakhtun]] general, [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], and included Balochistan, Peshawar, Daman, Multan, Sindh, and Punjab. The first time Ahmad Shah invaded Hindustan, the Mughal imperial army checked his advance successfully. Yet subsequent events led to a double alliance, one by marriage and another politically, between the Afghan King and the Mughal Emperor. The battle of Panipat was the effect of this political alliance. After the victory of Panipat, Ahmad Shah Durrani became the primary ruler over Northern India. The influence of Durrani monarch continued in Northern India up to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = All India Modern History Congress|last = Potdar|first = Datto Vaman|publisher = |year = 1938|isbn = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757, the Sikhs were persistently ambushing guards to loot trains. In order to send a message, and prevent such occurrences from recurring, Ahmad Shah destroyed the Shri Harimandir Sahib and filled the Sarovar (Holy water pool) with cow carcasses.{{sfn | Singh | 1984 | p=144-145}}

In 1758 the [[Maratha Empire]]'s general [[Raghunathrao]] attacked and conquered [[Lahore]] and [[Attock]] driving out [[Timur Shah Durrani]], the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Abdali, in the process. [[Lahore]], [[Multan]], [[Kashmir]] and other subahs on the eastern side of [[Attock]] were under Maratha rule. In Punjab and Kashmir, the Marathas were now major players.&lt;ref name="K.RoyIHB"&gt;{{cite book | last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |publisher=Permanent Black, India |pages=80–1 |isbn=978-81-7824-109-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1761, following the victory at the [[Third battle of Panipat]] between the [[Durrani Empire|Durrani]] and the [[Maratha Empire]], Ahmad Shah Abdali captured remnants of the Maratha Empire in Punjab and [[Kashmir]] regions and had consolidated control over them.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1762, there were persistent conflicts with the Sikhs. [[Sikh holocaust of 1762]] took place under the Muslim provincial government based at [[Lahore]] to wipe out the [[Sikh]]s, with 30,000 Sikhs being killed, an offensive that had begun with the Mughals, with the [[Sikh holocaust of 1746]],&lt;ref&gt;A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism: Sikh Religion and Philosophy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vcSRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq= p.86], Routledge, W.

==Sikh Rule==
{{Main|Sikh Empire}}
In 1799, a process to unify Punjab was started by Ranjit Singh. Training his army under the style of the East India Company, it was able to conquer much of Punjab and surrounding areas. The use of the suzerain-vassal polity as established by previous rulers had been instrumental in establishing the political control of the Sikhs. During this time, there was an increase in the population of Sikhs as well. In towns and cities, there was an increase in the population of urban Sikhs, while the same happened with an increase in rural Sikhs. This had also likely led to some of the ideological differences between Sikhs around this time.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|p=99}}

The invasions of the Muslim Zaman Shah, the second successor of Ahmad Shah Abdali had served as a catalyst. After the first invasion, Singh had recovered his own fort at Rohtas. During the second invasion, he had emerged as a leading Sikh chief. After the third invasion, he had decisively defeated Zamah Shah. This had eventually led to the takeover of Lahore in 1799. In 1809, Singh signed the Treaty of Amritsar with the British; in this treaty, Singh was recognised as the sole ruler of Punjab by the British and was given freedom to fight against the Muslims of surrounding areas.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|pages=100—101}}

Within ten years of Ranjit Singh's death in 1839, the Empire was taken over by the British who had already more or less exerted indirect or direct influence throughout the Subcontinent. At Lahore, there were increasing levels of nobles vying for power. A growing instability, allowed the British to come in and take over control of the area. After the British victories at the battles of the Sutlej in 1845–46, the army and territory of the boy Raja Duleep Singh was cut down. Lahore was garrisoned by British troops, and given a resident in the Durbar. In 1849, the British had formally taken control.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|p=99}}

{{main|Punjab Province (British India)}}
The Punjab ruled under the British was larger than that under Ranjit Singh. The colonial rule of Punjab had instated a system of bureaucracy and measure of the law. Replacing the 'paternal' system of the ruling was replaced by 'machine rule' with a system of laws, codes, and procedures. For purposes of control, the British established new forms of communication and transportation. These included post systems, railways, roads, and telegraphs. Irrigation projects between 1860 and 1920 brought 10 million acres of land under cultivation. Despite these developments, colonial rule was marked by exploitation of resources. For the purpose of exports, the majority of external trade was controlled by British export banks. The Imperial government exercised control over the finances of Punjab and took the majority of the income for itself.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|pages=128—129}}

To the agrarian and commercial class was added a professional middle class that had risen the social ladder through the use of the English education, which opened up new professions in law, government, and medicine.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|p=131}}

By the 1870s there had been communities of Muslims of the Wahabi sect, drawn from the lower classes, that intended to use jihad to get rid of the non-Muslims by force. A highlight of religious controversy during this time was that of the Ahmaddiya movement. Mirza Gulam Ahmad in his Burahin-i-Ahmaddiya which was meant to rejuvenate Islam on the basis of the Quran, had attempted to refute both Christian missionaries, and Hindus and Sikhs. In another work, Ahmad argued that Guru Nanak was a Muslim. He interpreted Jihad as a peaceful method, and declared himself to be the Messiah. This was met with significant controversy.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|p=134}} In the first and second decades of the early 20th century, the idea of Hindu and Muslim separation had become an active political tone. Muslims were told to remain aloof of the Indian National Congress, the main body seeking Indian Independence, because there was a general fear that representation based on elections and employment based upon competition was not in their interest. The All India Muslim League's demand for separate electorates for Muslims was granted at Amritsar in 1909. The Muslim league also demanded separate electorates in every province, even in those without Muslim majority populations, which was also granted by the Indian National Congress in 1916.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|p=136}}

An important event of the British Raj in Punjab was the [[Jallianwala Bagh Massacre]] of 1919. The British brigadier-general R.E.H Dyer marched fifty riflemen of the 1/9th Gurkhas,  54th Sikhs, and 59th Sikhs into the Bagh and ordered them to open fire into the crowd that had collected there. The official number of deaths given by the British was given as 379 people dead, but there are reported to be greater than 1000 killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Narain|first1=Savita|title=The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre|publisher=Lancer Publishers|isbn=978-1-935501-87-9|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been many  Indian Independence movements in Punjab at the time as well. Notably, the actions of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru on 17 December, 1928 in which the trio was responsible for killing J.P Saunders in revenge for the latter's murder of Lala Lajpati Rai. They were also responsible for the bombing of the Legislative Assembly in Delhi on the 8th of April in 1929. The three believed that the nonviolent movement was a failure. Nevertheless, the use of violence in the Indian Independence movement became unpopular after the execution of the trio on the 23 March 1932.{{sfn|Grewal|1990|p=165}}

In 1947, the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] of British India was divided along religious lines into [[West Punjab]] and [[East Punjab]]. The western part was assimilated into the new country of Pakistan while the east stayed in India. This led to riots. The [[Partition of India]] in 1947 split the former Raj province of Punjab; the mostly [[Muslim]] western part became the Pakistani province of West Punjab and the mostly Sikh and Hindu eastern part became the Indian province of Punjab. Many Sikhs and Hindus lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and so partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence. Several small Punjabi [[princely states]], including [[Patiala]], also became part of India.
The undivided Punjab, of which Punjab (Pakistan) forms a major region today, was home to a large minority population of [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] Sikhs and Hindus unto 1947 apart from the Muslim majority.&lt;ref&gt;The Punjab in 1920s – A Case study of Muslims, Zarina Salamat, Royal Book Company, [[Karachi]], 1997. table 45, pp. 136. {{ISBN|969-407-230-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backed and trained by the Pakistani Inter-Services-Intelligence starting from the 1970s, a minority of Sikhs called for the creation of a state known as Khalistan, along with the lines of Pakistan. This had led to the state of emergency given by Indira Gandhi, who had called in Indian troops to stop the militants who were holding the Golden Temple hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Gus|title=Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uJ6MeYq_FbkC&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;vq=khalistan&amp;pg=PA190#v=snippet&amp;q=khalistan&amp;f=false|date=2013|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4522-0582-3|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist attacks targeted members of the Sikh majority that opposed the creation of Khalistan and wished to stay with India. The extremists carried out various attacks, including placing a bomb in an Air India flight over the Atlantic Ocean, killing more than 300 people. Other terrorist attacks had continued, notably against the Punjab police and others, in which more Sikhs were killed than other groups. Much of the funding for the fringe group had come from expatriate sources abroad in America and Europe, and most of the Sikh fringe separatist movements were based in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lutz|first1=James|last2=Lutz|first2=Brenda|title=Global Terrorism|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-53785-8|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holy Roman Empire''' ({{lang-la|Sacrum Romanum Imperium}}; {{lang-de|Heiliges Römisches Reich}}) was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in [[Central Europe]] that developed during the [[Early Middle Ages]] and continued until its dissolution in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire Holy Roman Empire], Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 15 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the [[Kingdom of Germany]], though it also came to include the neighboring [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], the [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]], and numerous other territories.&lt;ref&gt;James Bryce, The Holy Roman Empire (The MacMillan Company, 1913), [https://books.google.com/books?id=O8cQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA183 p.183].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whaley&gt;Joachim Whaley, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire: Volume I: Maximilian I to the Peace of Westphalia, 1493–1648 (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QXdPzWXCphkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA17 pp.&amp;nbsp;17–20].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Lonnie R.

On 25 December 800, [[Pope Leo III]] crowned the [[Kings of the Franks|Frankish king]] [[Charlemagne]] as [[Carolingian Empire|Emperor]], reviving the title in [[Western Europe]], more than three centuries after the [[fall of the Roman Empire|fall]] of the earlier ancient [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476. The title continued in the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian family]] until 888 and from 896 to 899, after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant, [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I]], in 924. The title was revived again in 962 when [[Otto I]] was crowned emperor, fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Norman F.

The exact term "Holy Roman Empire" was not used until the [[13th century]], but the concept of ''[[translatio imperii]]'',{{efn|"transfer of rule"}} the notion that he—the sovereign ruler—held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of [[Rome]], was fundamental to the prestige of the emperor.&lt;ref name=Whaley /&gt; The office of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was traditionally elective, although frequently controlled by dynasties. The mostly German [[prince-electors]], the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire, usually elected one of their peers as "[[King of the Romans]]", and he would later be crowned emperor by the [[Pope]]; the tradition of papal coronations was discontinued in the [[16th century]].

The empire never achieved the extent of political unification as was formed to the west in [[France]], evolving instead into a decentralized, limited elective monarchy composed of [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|hundreds of sub-units]]: [[king]]doms, [[principality|principalities]], [[duchy|duchies]], [[county|counties]], [[prince-bishop]]rics, [[Free Imperial City|Free Imperial Cities]], and other domains.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/hre.htm The Holy Roman Empire], Heraldica.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the emperor was limited, and while the various princes, lords, bishops, and cities of the empire were [[vassal]]s who owed the emperor their allegiance, they also possessed an extent of privileges that gave them ''de facto'' independence within their territories. Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|dissolved]] the empire on 6 August 1806 following the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] by emperor [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] the month before.

In a decree following the 1512 [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Cologne]], the name was changed to the "'''Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation'''" ({{lang-de|Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation}}, {{lang-la|Imperium Romanum Sacrum Nationis Germanicæ}}),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hamish Wilson, ''The Holy Roman Empire, 1495–1806'', MacMillan Press 1999, London, page 2; [http://www.london.diplo.de/Vertretung/london/en/06/German_20History/Holy__Roman__Empire/Background__seite.html The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation] at the Embassy of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in [[London]] website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229173411/http://www.london.diplo.de/Vertretung/london/en/06/German_20History/Holy__Roman__Empire/Background__seite.html |date=29 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1000-01&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The Holy Roman Empire|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=349&amp;HistoryID=aa35&amp;gtrack=pthc|publisher=historyworld|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form first used in a document in 1474.&lt;ref name="Whaley17" /&gt; The new title was adopted partly because the Empire had lost most of its Italian and Burgundian ([[Kingdom of Arles]]) territories to the south and west by the late [[15th century]],&lt;ref&gt;Whaley 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20&lt;/ref&gt; but also to emphasize the new importance of the German [[Imperial Estate]]s in ruling the Empire due to the Imperial Reform.&lt;ref&gt;Hans K.

Besides, contradicting the traditional view concerning that designation, Hermann Weisert has stated in a study on imperial titulature that, despite the claim of many textbooks, the name ''"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation"'' never had an official status and points out that documents were thirty times as likely to omit the national suffix as include it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H.

In a famous assessment of the name, the political philosopher [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) remarked sardonically: "This agglomeration which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was in no way holy, nor Roman, nor an empire."&lt;ref&gt;Original text: ''Ce corps qui s'appelait et qui s'appelle encore le saint empire romain n'était en aucune manière ni saint, ni romain, ni empire.''

=== Early Middle Ages ===

==== Carolingian forerunners ====
{{Further|Carolingian Empire}}
As [[Western Roman Empire|Roman]] power in [[Gaul]] declined during the 5th century, local Germanic tribes assumed control.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Innes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CtUueBIMm-cC State and Society in the Early Middle Ages: The Middle Rhine Valley, 400–1000] (Cambridge, 2004), pp.167–170.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 5th and early 6th centuries, the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]], under [[Clovis I]] and his successors, consolidated [[Franks|Frankish]] tribes and extended hegemony over others to gain control of northern Gaul and the middle [[Rhine river]] valley region.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1913), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1996), pp.232, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 8th century, however, the Merovingians had been reduced to figureheads, and the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], led by [[Charles Martel]], had become the ''de facto'' rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1913), pp.35–36,38.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 751, Martel's son [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] became King of the Franks, and later gained the sanction of the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Rosamond McKitterick, [https://www.questia.com/read/52238336/the-frankish-kingdoms-under-the-carolingians-751-987 The Frankish Kingdoms under the Carolingians, 751–987] (1983), pp.48–50. {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB-Pippin&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/place/France/Pippin-III France/Pippin III]&lt;/ref&gt; The Carolingians would maintain a close alliance with the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1913), pp.38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 768 Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] became King of the Franks and began an extensive expansion of the realm.  He eventually incorporated the territories of present-day France, Germany, northern Italy, and beyond, linking the Frankish kingdom with Papal lands.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1996), p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George C. Kohn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OIzreCGlHxIC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT125#v=onepage Dictionary of Wars] (2007), pp.113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 797, the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Constantine VI]] was removed from the throne by his mother [[Irene of Athens|Irene]] who declared herself Empress. As the Church regarded a male Roman Emperor as the head of Christendom, Pope Leo III sought a new candidate for the dignity. Charlemagne's good service to the Church in his defense of Papal possessions against the [[Lombards]] made him the ideal candidate. On Christmas Day of 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne emperor, restoring the title in the West for the first time in over three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, pp.44,50–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick (1983), p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 802, Irene was overthrown by [[Nikephoros I]] and henceforth there were two Roman Emperors.

After Charlemagne died in 814, the imperial crown passed to his son, [[Louis the Pious]]. Upon Louis' death in 840, it passed to his son [[Lothair I|Lothair]], who had been his co-ruler. By this point the territory of Charlemagne had been divided into several territories, and over the course of the later ninth century the title of Emperor was disputed by the Carolingian rulers of [[Western Francia]] and [[Eastern Francia]], with first the western king ([[Charles the Bald]]) and then the eastern ([[Charles the Fat]]), who briefly reunited the Empire, attaining the prize.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} After the death of Charles the Fat in 888, however, the Carolingian Empire broke apart, and was never restored. According to [[Regino of Prüm]], the parts of the realm "spewed forth kinglets", and each part elected a kinglet "from its own bowels".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Collins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZtYiBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=regino%20prum%20kinglet&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage The Birth of the West: Rome, Germany, France, and the Creation of Europe in the Tenth Century] (New York, 2013), p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Charles the Fat, those crowned emperor by the [[pope]] controlled only territories in Italy. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The last such emperor was [[Berengar I of Italy]], who died in 924.

==== Formation ====
Around 900, autonomous [[stem duchy|stem duchies]] ([[Duchy of Franconia|Franconia]], [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], and [[Lotharingia#Duchy of Lotharingia|Lotharingia]]) reemerged in East Francia. After the Carolingian king [[Louis the Child]] died without issue in 911, East Francia did not turn to the Carolingian ruler of West Francia to take over the realm but instead elected one of the dukes, [[Conrad of Franconia]], as ''Rex Francorum Orientalium''.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Germany from the earliest times to the present day |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |last2=Hansen-Taylor |first2=Marie  |year=1894 |page=117 |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co. |place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}} On his deathbed, Conrad yielded the crown to his main rival, [[Henry the Fowler]] of Saxony (r. 919–36), who was elected king at the Diet of [[Fritzlar]] in 919.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;{{rp|118}} Henry reached a truce with the raiding [[Magyars]], and in 933 he won a first victory against them in the [[Battle of Riade]].&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;{{rp|121}}

Henry died in 936, but his descendants, the [[Ottonian dynasty|Liudolfing (or Ottonian) dynasty]], would continue to rule the Eastern kingdom for roughly a century.  Upon Henry the Fowler's death, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], his son and designated successor,&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Hoyt and Stanley Chodorow, ''Europe in the Middle Ages'' (Harcourt brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1976) p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; was elected King in [[Aachen]] in 936.&lt;ref name="magill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank|title=Dictionary of World Biography|volume=II|year=1998|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|706}} He overcame a series of revolts from a younger brother and from several dukes. After that, the king managed to control the appointment of dukes and often also employed bishops in administrative affairs.&lt;ref name="cantor"&gt;{{cite book |first=Norman F. |last=Cantor |authorlink=Norman Cantor |year=1994 |title=The Civilization of the Middle Ages|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0-06-092553-6|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212–13}}

[[File:HRR.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The Holy Roman Empire from 962 to 1806]]

In 951, Otto came to the aid of [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide]], the widowed queen of Italy, defeating her enemies, marrying her, and taking control over Italy.&lt;ref name="cantor" /&gt;{{rp|214–15}} In 955, Otto won a decisive victory over the [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lechfeld]].&lt;ref name="magill" /&gt;{{rp|707}} In 962, Otto was crowned Emperor by [[Pope John XII]],&lt;ref name="magill" /&gt;{{rp|707}} thus intertwining the affairs of the German kingdom with those of Italy and the Papacy. Otto's coronation as Emperor marked the German kings as successors to the Empire of Charlemagne, which through the concept of ''[[translatio imperii]]'', also made them consider themselves as successors to Ancient Rome.

The kingdom had no permanent capital city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Nuremberg: The imaginary capital |first=Stephen |last=Brockmann |authorlink= |last2= |first2= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |edition= |volume= |year=2006 |origyear= |page=15 |pages= |publisher=Camden House |place=Rochester, NY |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QnBVEg8t4TcC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22holy+roman+empire%22+%22capital+city%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22holy%20roman%20empire%22%20%22capital%20city%22 |accessdate= |isbn=1-57113-345-3 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kings traveled between residences (called [[Kaiserpfalz]]) to discharge affairs. However, each king preferred certain places; in Otto's case, this was the city of [[Magdeburg]]. Kingship continued to be transferred by election, but Kings often ensured their own sons were elected during their lifetimes, enabling them to keep the crown for their families. This only changed after the end of the Salian dynasty in the 12th century.

In 963, Otto deposed the current Pope John XII and chose [[Pope Leo VIII]] as the new pope (although John XII and Leo VIII both claimed the papacy until 964 when John XII died). This also renewed the conflict with the [[Byzantine Emperor|Eastern Emperor in Constantinople]], especially after Otto's son [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] (r. 967–83) adopted the designation ''imperator Romanorum''. Still, Otto II formed marital ties with the east when he married the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu]].&lt;ref name="magill" /&gt;{{rp|708}} Their son, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], came to the throne only three years old, and was subjected to a power struggle and series of regencies until his age of majority in 994. Up to that time, he had remained in Germany, while a deposed Duke, [[Crescentius II]], ruled over Rome and part of Italy, ostensibly in his stead.

In 996 Otto III appointed his cousin [[Pope Gregory V|Gregory V]] the first German Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien, ''Lives of the Popes: The Pontiffs from St. Peter to Benedict XVI'', (HarperCollins Publishers, 2000), 138.&lt;/ref&gt; A foreign pope and foreign papal officers were seen with suspicion by Roman nobles, who were led by [[Crescentius II]] to revolt. [[Otto III]]'s former mentor [[Antipope John XVI]] briefly held Rome, until the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] seized the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/How%20to%20See%20the%20Vatican|title=How to See the Vatican|last=Sladen|first=Douglas Brooke Wheelton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto died young in 1002, and was succeeded by his cousin [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], who focused on Germany.&lt;ref name="cantor" /&gt;{{rp|215–17}}

[[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] died in 1024 and [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], first of the [[Salian|Salian Dynasty]], was elected king only after some debate among dukes and nobles. This group eventually developed into the college of [[prince-elector|Electors]].

The Holy Roman Empire became eventually composed of four kingdoms. The kingdoms were:
* [[Kingdom of Germany]] (part of the empire since 962),
* [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] (from 962 until 1648),
* [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] (since 1002 as the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and raised to a kingdom in 1198),
* [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]] (from 1032 to 1378).

=== High Middle Ages ===

==== Investiture controversy ====
Kings often employed bishops in administrative affairs and often determined who would be appointed to ecclesiastical offices.&lt;ref name="Barraclough"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany|year=1984|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-30153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101–134}} In the wake of the [[Cluniac Reforms]], this involvement was increasingly seen as inappropriate by the Papacy. The reform-minded [[Pope Gregory VII]] was determined to oppose such practices, which led to the [[Investiture Controversy]] with King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] (r. 1056–1106).&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|101–134}} He repudiated the Pope's interference and persuaded his bishops to excommunicate the Pope, whom he famously addressed by his born name "Hildebrand", rather than his regnal name "Pope Gregory VII".&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|109}} The Pope, in turn, excommunicated the king, declared him deposed, and dissolved the oaths of loyalty made to Henry.&lt;ref name=Gascoigne /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|109}} The king found himself with almost no political support and was forced to make the famous [[Walk to Canossa]] in 1077,&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|122–24}} by which he achieved a lifting of the excommunication at the price of humiliation.  Meanwhile, the German princes had elected another king, [[Rudolf of Swabia]].&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Henry managed to defeat him but was subsequently confronted with more uprisings, renewed excommunication, and even the rebellion of his sons. After his death, his second son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], reached an agreement with the Pope and the bishops in the 1122 [[Concordat of Worms]].&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|123–34}} The political power of the Empire was maintained, but the conflict had demonstrated the limits of the ruler's power, especially in regard to the Church, and it robbed the king of the sacral status he had previously enjoyed. The Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.

=== Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen dynasty ===
[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Hohenstaufen-ruled Holy Roman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]
When the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I "Barbarossa"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his – albeit diminished – possessions.

The Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;Smail, Daniel Lord. Gibson, Kelly.

Riley-Smith, Jonathan.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].

[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the "Romanness" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.

Frederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159–81). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[Lübeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunyadi, Zsolt. Laszlovszky, József. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=frederick+third+crusader+died+asia+minor#v=onepage&amp;q=frederick%20third%20crusader%20died%20asia%20minor ''The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity''] (Volume '''1''' of CEU Medievalia Series) Central European University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|978-9639241428}} p 129&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were, however, never part of the Holy Roman Empire.

Under the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.

[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries.]]

[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Despite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: In the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terræ,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.

==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====
[[File:Karte Böhmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]
The [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title "king" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.

==== Interregnum ====
{{main|Interregnum (HRE)}}
After the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, the Interregnum ended with the unanimous election of [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count.

==== Changes in political structure ====

[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]

During the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of "property" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: Whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. It is important to note, however, that jurisdiction at this time did not include legislation, which virtually did not exist until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.

During this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'' Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.

=== Late Middle Ages ===
{{Further|Late Middle Ages|Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages}}

==== Rise of the territories after the Hohenstaufens ====
The difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of [[prince-elector]]s (''Kurfürsten''), whose composition and procedures were set forth in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], which remained valid until 1806. This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also their sons were to know the imperial languages – [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) – Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="langues"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Žůrek|first1=Václav|title=Les langues du roi.

Revue de l'Institut français d'histoire en Allemagne|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=French|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift in power away from the emperor is also revealed in the way the post-Hohenstaufen kings attempted to sustain their power. Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.

The kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328–47) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.

==== Imperial reform ====
{{Further|Vehmic court}}
[[File:HRR 1400.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The Holy Roman Empire in 1400]]

The "constitution" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433–1437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452–1493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other – feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.

Simultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the "legitimate" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppress the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.

With these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of "reform" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' – to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.

When [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477–1488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would – to a degree – persist until the end of the Empire in 1806.

However, it took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin to function effectively; only in 1512 would the Imperial Circles be finalized. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation'' ("Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation").

In 1516, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], grandfather of the future Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], died.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gC8O9GI9JX0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Ferdinand+II+of+Aragon+grandfather++Charles+V+died#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon%20grandfather%20%20Charles%20V%20died ''Historical Dictionary of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation''] by Mullett, Michael (Scarecrow Press, 30 Apr. 2010 {{ISBN|978-0810873933}} p 81).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a combination of (1) the traditions of dynastic succession in Aragon, which permitted maternal inheritance with no precedence for female rule; (2) the insanity of Charles's mother, [[Joanna of Castile]]; and (3) the insistence by his remaining grandfather, [[Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire|Maximilian I]], that he take up his royal titles, Charles initiated his reign in Castile and Aragon, a union which evolved into [[Spanish Crown|Spain]], in conjunction with his mother.  This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''.  The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived.  The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].

In addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities – [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] – becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].

[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]

Charles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.

[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]
[[File:Holy Roman Empire 1648.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]

Germany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.

After Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.

The actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.

At the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.

=== Modern period ===
{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}

==== Prussia and Austria ====
{{Further|Austria–Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}
By the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]]; some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.

==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====
{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}
[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]
From 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.

The [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. "Mediatization" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. "Secularization" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.

The empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].

The Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].

The only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.

== Institutions ==
The Holy Roman Empire was not a highly centralized state like most countries today. Instead, it was divided into dozens – eventually hundreds – of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,&lt;ref&gt;The only prince allowed to call himself "king" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire&lt;/ref&gt; [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.

From the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the Emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, Emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles, and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dissemination of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.

=== Imperial estates ===
{{Main|Imperial State}}
The number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' ("little states") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' ("[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]"). 
An entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:
* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.
* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].
* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.
* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.

A sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.&lt;ref&gt;Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of ''Reichsstände'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].

=== King of the Romans ===
{{Main|King of the Romans}}
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]

A prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''römischer König''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]],  the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.

After being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of "Emperor" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.

The Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.&lt;ref name="Hirschi"&gt;Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, Göttingen, p.&amp;nbsp;393–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===
{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}
[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s]]

The Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe siècle'', Honoré Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two "benches", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into "colleges" by geography. Each college had one vote.

The third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].

=== Imperial courts ===
The Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495.

=== Imperial circles ===
[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]

As part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' ("Circle Diet"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle.  Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].

=== Army ===
{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}
The [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.

Despite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,&lt;ref&gt;André Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.

=== Administrative centres ===
[[Aulic Council|''Reichshofrat'']] resided in [[Vienna]].

''[[Reichskammergericht ]]'' resided in [[Worms]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Speyer]] and [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]] before it was moved permanently to [[Wetzlar]].

[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|''Reichstag'']] resided variously in [[Paderborn]], [[Bad Lippspringe]], [[Ingelheim am Rhein]], [[Diedenhofen]] (now [[Thionville]]), [[Aachen]], [[Worms]], [[Forchheim]], [[Trebur]], [[Fritzlar]], [[Ravenna]], [[Quedlinburg]], [[Dortmund]], [[Verona]], [[Minden]], [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Merseburg]], [[Goslar]], [[Würzburg]], [[Bamberg]], [[Schwäbisch Hall]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], [[Speyer]], [[Gelnhausen]], [[Erfurt]], [[Cheb|Eger]] (now [[Cheb]]), [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], [[Lindau]], [[Freiburg]], [[Cologne]], [[Konstanz]] and [[Trier]] before it was moved permanently to [[Regensburg]].

The Holy Roman Empire never had a [[capital city]]. Usually, the Holy Roman Emperor ruled from a place of his own choice. This was called an imperial seat. Seats of the Holy Roman Emperor included: [[Aachen]] (from 794), [[Munich]] (1328–1347 and 1744–1745), [[Prague]] (1355–1437 and 1576–1611), [[Vienna]] (1438–1576, 1611–1740 and 1745–1806) and [[Frankfurt am Main]] (1742–1744) among other cities.

[[Imperial election]]s were mostly held in Frankfurt am Main, but also took place in [[Augsburg]], [[Rhens]], [[Cologne]] and [[Regensburg]]. Going as far as into the 16th century, the elected Holy Roman Emperor was then [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] and [[Papal appointment|appointed by the Pope]] in [[Rome]], but individual coronations also happened in [[Ravenna]], [[Bologna]] and [[Reims]].

== Demographics ==
===Population===
Overall population figures for the Holy Roman Empire are extremely vague and vary widely. Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agency that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the  Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follow:&lt;ref&gt;G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500–1750'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

- 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 per cent of the total land area and 12 per cent of the population;&lt;br&gt;
- 45 dynastic principalities with 80 per cent of the land and 80 per cent of the population;&lt;br&gt;
- 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 per cent of the land and 3.5 per cent of the population;&lt;br&gt;
- 60 imperial towns with 1 per cent of the land and 3.5 per cent of the population;&lt;br&gt;
- Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 per cent of the land and 1 per cent of the population.

German demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15–17 million around 1600, declined to 10–13 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16–17 million by 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

A credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follow:&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, vol. II, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

- 9 million Austrian subjects (including Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia);&lt;br&gt;
- 4 million Prussian subjects;&lt;br&gt;
- 14–15 million inhabitants for the rest of the Empire.

=== Religion ===
[[File:Druck Augsburger Reichsfrieden.jpg|thumb|upright|Front page of the [[Peace of Augsburg]], which laid the legal groundwork for two co-existing religious confessions ([[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]]) in the German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire]]
[[Roman Catholicism]] constituted the single official religion of the Empire until 1555. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.

[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptists|Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. [[Anabaptism]] came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.

In addition, a [[History of the Jews in Germany#In the Holy Roman Empire|Jewish minority]] existed in the Holy Roman Empire.

'''Isaac-Joseph Berruyer''' (7 November 1681, [[Rouen]] – 18 February 1758, [[Paris]]) was a French [[Jesuit]] historian. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1697.

==Works==

His great work is "A History of the People of God," published in three parts.

The first of these parts bears the title "Histoire du peuple de Dieu depuis son origine jusqu'à la venue du Messie" (7 vols., Paris, 1728). A revised and augmented edition of this was published in Paris in 1733. Next followed (Paris, 1734), a supplement, containing a continuation of the prophecies of the ''[[Old Testament]]'', the History of [[Job (Biblical figure)|Job]], maps necessary for understanding the sacred history, etc. By 1736 seven editions of the work had been issued. It was translated into German, Italian, Spanish, and Polish.

The second part of the "history" was published, also at Paris, in 1753: "Histoire du peuple de Dieu depuis la naissance du Messie jusqu'à la fin de la Synagogue." in 1754 an ''édition plus exacte'' appeared at Antwerp (8 vols.) and in 1755, at Paris, still another edition (4 vols.). The latter contained five questions: (1) On Christ, the object of scriptures; (2) On Christ, the Son of God; (3) On Christ, the Son of Man; (4) On Christ, the founder of a new religion; (5) On the [[Presentation of Christ in the Temple]] and the [[Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]. According to [[Augustin de Backer]] this second part of the History was published without the knowledge, and against the will, of the superiors in the Jesuit house in Paris. Berruyer put his name to only a small number of copies of this publication.

The third part of the work has the title, "Histoire du peuple de Dieu, ou paraphrase des Épitres des Apôtres" (2 vols., Lyons, 1757). The work, as various parts appeared, aroused an uproar and some bitter controversy. The freedom with which he described certain facts was considered unbecoming. Serious fault was found with the author for giving to portions of the sacred narrative the air of romance rather than of sober history. Some propositions put forward by him were construed as favoring [[Nestorianism]]. But above all Berruyer was blamed for following the opinions of [[Jean Hardouin]].

The work was condemned by many bishops of France, by the superiors of the Society, by the Sorbonne, and by the Parliament of Paris. The first part was put on the Index, 27 May 1732; the second part, 3 December 1754, and by a Brief of Benedict XIV, 17 February 1758; the third part 24 April 1758, and by and Brief of Clement XIII, 2 December 1758. (See ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', Rome, 1900, 62). A corrected edition of the first part, approved by the Roman Censors, was published at [[Besançon]] in 1828.

'''Sir John Edward Lloyd''' (who wrote as '''J. E. Lloyd''') (5 May 1861 &amp;ndash; 20 June 1947), was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[historian]], the author of the first serious history of the country's formative years, ''A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest'', 2 vols. London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1911; Second edition 1912; Third edition 1939.

Another of his great works was ''Owen Glendower: Owen Glyn Dŵr'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1931. For his achievements in the field, he was [[knight]]ed in 1934. Under his editorship, the first edition of the ''[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]'' was compiled, though not published until after his death (1950).

'''John Hetherington''' is a presumed apocryphal [[English people|English]] [[haberdasher]], often credited as the inventor of the [[top hat]], which is said to have caused a riot when he first wore it in public on 15 January 1797.

==The story==
The common form of the story, as reproduced in many books, has it that he was arraigned before the Lord Mayor on 15 January 1797 on a charge of [[breach of the peace]] and inciting a riot, and was required to post a £500 bond. Reportedly he had "appeared on the public highway wearing upon his head what he called a silk hat (which was shiny lustre and calculated to frighten timid people)" and the officers of the Crown stated that "several women fainted at the unusual sight, while children screamed, dogs yelped and a younger son of Cordwainer Thomas was thrown down by the crowd which collected and had his right arm broken".&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Law Review'', 1927, attributed to ''Hatters' Gazette'', 16 January 1797&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Evidently this story first appeared in a late 1890s edition of the ''Hatters' Gazette'': in 1899 the quarterly journal ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' reported the story, noting that it originated in "a recent number of the Hatters' Gazette".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Thornton | first = Richard H. | authorlink = | last2 = | first2 = | authorlink2 = | title = The First Silk Hat in London | journal = [[Notes and Queries]] | volume = | issue = s9-III | pages = 325 | url = http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/s9-III/70/325-b | doi = | id = | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later accounts also attribute the story to the ''Hatters' Gazette'' — however, both the ''Australian Law Review'' of 1927, and ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' in its "I Read in the Papers" column of 8 January 1927,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ford | first = Henry | authorlink = |author2=W. J. Cameron | title = Dearborn Independent Magazine January 1927-May 1927 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | year = 2003 | location = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nkZ2Il0aP5oC&amp;pg=PA30 | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7661-5993-0| page = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; erroneously describe it as being reported in a 1797 edition of the ''Hatters' Gazette'' (''The Dearborn Independent'' specifying it more narrowly as the 16 January 1797 edition) — obviously an error, as the ''Hatters' Gazette'' only began publication in 1878.

''[[The Canberra Times]]'' for 10 June 1927 reproduced the usual account, with an introduction saying, "During a discussion in the columns of 'The Times' (London) on the pioneer of umbrellas, a correspondent sent an extract from an old journal in her possession, dated 16 January 1797, giving the following amusing account of the wearing of the first silk hat in London".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title = The First Top Hat | work = [[The Canberra Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = 10 June 1927 | url =http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1214155 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known which "old journal" is referred to, but as noted above it cannot be the ''Hatters' Gazette''.

{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}
The '''King’s Highway''' was a [[trade route]] of vital importance in the [[ancient Near East]], connecting Africa with Mesopotamia. It ran from [[Egypt]] across the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to [[Aqaba]], from where it turned northward across [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], leading to [[Damascus]] and the [[Euphrates River]].

After the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the 7th century AD and until the 16th century it served as the [[Hajj|''darb al-hajj'']] or pilgrimage road for Muslims coming from [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and beyond and heading for the holy city of [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="Lonely Planet, Jordan"&gt;Lonely Planet, ''Jordan''&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Jordan]], [[Highway 35 (Jordan)|Highway 35]] and [[Highway 15 (Jordan)|Highway 15]] follow this route, connecting [[Irbid]] in the north with Aqaba in the south. The southern part crosses several deep [[wadi]]s, making it a highly scenic if curvy and rather low-speed road.&lt;ref name="Lonely Planet, Jordan"/&gt;{{qn|date=April 2017}}

==Route==
[[Image:Ancient Levant routes.png|thumb|right|300px|The Via Maris (purple), King's Highway (red), and other ancient Levantine trade routes, c. 1300 BCE]]
The Highway began in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis, Egypt]] and from there went eastward to [[Clysma]] (modern [[Suez]]), through the [[Mitla Pass]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] forts of [[An-Nakhl Fortress|Nekhl]] and [[Themed]] in the Sinai desert to [[Eilat]] and [[Aqaba]]. From there the Highway turned northward through the [[Arabah]], past [[Petra]] and [[Ma'an]] to [[Udruh]], [[Sela (Edom)|Sela]], and [[Shaubak]]. It passed through [[Kerak]] and the land of [[Moab]] to [[Madaba]], Rabbah Ammon/Philadelphia (modern [[Amman]]), [[Jerash|Gerasa]], [[Bosra]], [[Damascus]], and [[Tadmor]], ending at [[Resafa]] on the upper Euphrates.

==History==

===Iron Age===
Numerous ancient states, including [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], and various [[Aramaean]] polities depended largely on the King's Highway for trade.

===Classical Antiquity===
The [[Nabataeans]] used this road as a trade route for luxury goods such as [[frankincense]] and [[spice]]s from southern [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. It was possibly the cause of their war with [[Hasmonean]] [[Alexander Jannaeus]] and with [[Iturea]] in the beginning of the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name=kasherhe&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0044-4758| volume = 50| pages = 107–120| first = Aryeh| last = Kasher| title = Alexander Yannai's Wars with the Nabataeans / מלחמות אלכסנדר ינאי בנבטים| journal = Zion / ציון| date = 1985-01-01| jstor = 23559931| language = Hebrew | postscript =;}} English abstract: {{jstor|23559946}}, p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period the road was called ''Via Regia''. Emperor [[Trajan]] rebuilt and renamed it ''[[Via Traiana Nova]]'', under which name it served as a military and trade road along the fortified [[Limes Arabicus]].

===Byzantine Period===
The Highway has also been used as an important [[pilgrimage]] route for [[Christian]]s, as it passed next to [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], [[Moses]]' death and burial site according to the [[Bible]]. Another road connected it with [[Jerusalem]] via [[al-Maghtas]], the "Baptism Site" on the [[Jordan River]] (where [[Jesus]] is believed to have been baptized by [[John the Baptist]]), [[Livias]] and [[Jericho]].

===After the Muslim conquest===
After the [[Muslim conquests]], the road was used it as the main [[Hajj]] route from [[History of Syria|Syria]] to [[Mecca]], until the [[Ottoman Turks]] built the [[Tariq al-Bint]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=hajj/&gt;

A difficult time was during the [[Crusades|Crusader]] period, when the road passed through the province of [[Oultrejordain]] of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=hajj&gt;{{Cite book |last=Petersen |first=Andrew |editor1-last=Porter |editor1-first=Venetia |editor2-first=Liana  |editor2-last=Saif |title=The Hajj: collected essays |date=2013 |contribution=The Lost Fort of Mafraq and the Syrian Hajj Route in the 16th Century |page= 21 |isbn=9780861591930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During periods of truce the Hajj caravans were usually left unharmed by the Crusader lords of Oultrejourdain, with the memorable exception of [[Raynald of Châtillon]], who attacked and plundered the pilgrims twice. His deeds would eventually lead not only to his own death at the hands of [[Saladin]], but altogether to the fall of the Crusader kingdom in [[Battle of Hattin|1187]].&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hamilton, Bernard |title=The Elephant of Christ: Reynald of Châtillon |journal=Studies in Church History |number=15 |year=1978 |pages=97–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Runciman, Stephen|year=1951|title=The History of the Crusades. Volume II. The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East 1100 – 1187|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-06162-9|pages=445, 450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==
The King's Highway or ''Derech HaMelech'' is referred to in the [[Book of Numbers]], ({{bibleverse||Numbers|20:17}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|21:22}}), where it is related that the [[Israelites]], in their [[The Exodus|Exodus]] journey needed to use the road. They had left from Kadesh, and requested [[right of way]] across from King [[Edom]] but were refused passage. He vowed he would attack them if they used the road. They even offered to pay for any water their cattle drank. Still King Edom refused them passage and advanced against them with a large and heavily armed force.  After making a detour and coming to the Transjordan area between [[Wadi Mujib|River Arnon]] and [[Zarqa River|River Jabbok]].,&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 21:23-24&lt;/ref&gt; they directed the same request to [[Sihon]] the [[Amorite]] King, and for the second time on the same road they were denied passage and King Sihon engaged them in battle at Jahaz. And they won that battle by the edge of the sword, a close call. As a result, they gained control in that land and to the north of it. The tribes of [[tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] (eastern half), [[tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] subsequently settled those territories.

Many of the wars of the Israelites against the kingdoms of the trans-Jordanian highlands during the period of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (and its sister-kingdom, the [[Kingdom of Judah]]) were probably fought, at least in part, over control of the Highway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2362">The '''Leipziger Weltchronik''' (German for ''[[World chronicle]] of [[Leipzig]]'') is preserved in five papyrus fragments in the Papyrus Collection in Leipzig. The fragments were bought in 1913, but were only published in 2010. The chronicle dates to the first half of the 2nd century AD. These are the earliest known fragments of a world chronicle. On the badly preserved fragments events on the founding of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] ([[Boeotia]]) and a list of Babylonian and Egyptian kings are preserved. [[Hesiod]] is named. The chronicle is perhaps Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Weiß: ''Archiv für Papyrusforschung'' 56/1, 2010, p. 26-37&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following events are preserved in the four remaining columns:

*column I: The legend of the founding of Thebes (P.Lips. Inv. 1229).
*column II: heavily damaged, [[Hesiod]] and the [[Ionians]] are mentioned, there appears the year 772 v.Chr. (P.Lips. Inv. 1232 + P.Lips. Inv. 1231, Kol. I)
*column III: Babylonian kings are mentioned, the [[Pythian Games]] and there is a list of Egyptian kings (P.Lips. Inv. 1231, Kol. II + P.Lips. Inv. 590, Kol. I + P.Lips. Inv. 1228, Kol. II)

'''Milan pl. Šufflay''' (8 November 1879 – 19 February 1931) was a Croatian [[historian]] and [[politician]]. He was one of the founders of [[Albanology]] and the author of the first Croatian [[science fiction]] novel. As a [[Croatian nationalist]], he was persecuted in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], and his murder subsequently caused an internationally publicized affair.

==Early life==
Šufflay was born into a lower{{sfn|Horvat|1965|p=173}} noble family (hence ''pl.'', ''plemeniti'', "noble", equivalent of ''von'') in [[Lepoglava]], in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] to Augustin Šufflay (1847–190?), a teacher, andFranciska Welle von Vorstern (1847–1910), a [[Germans of Hungary|German Hungarian]] from [[Osijek]].{{sfn|Horvat|1965|p=174}} The family coat of arms was included in ''Der Adel von Kroatien und Slavonien'' (1899) as "Sufflay de Otrussevcz".&lt;ref name="Siebmacher1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Siebmacher|title=Der Adel von Kroatien und Slavonien|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FVmAAAAMAAJ|year=1986|publisher=Bauer &amp; Raspe|isbn=978-3-87947-035-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their original surname was Sufflei or Schufflei, and their estate was [[Otruševec]].

He attended a comprehensive high school in [[Zagreb]] and studied [[history]] at the [[University of Zagreb]]. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1901 from the same university with thesis ''Croatia and the Last Endeavor of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]] Under the Scepter of Three [[Komnenos]] (1075-1180)''.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalna.nsk.hr/?object=info&amp;id=10589&lt;/ref&gt; He was a brilliant student both in high school and at the university. Already during his studies, he spoke French, German, Italian, English, all the Slavic languages, as well as Latin, old Greek, and middle Greek. Later in life, he learned modern Greek, Albanian, Hebrew, and Sanskrit. [[Tadija Smičiklas]] considered Šufflay his most gifted student and took him as his assistant when editing ''Codex Diplomaticus'' of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131102023837/http://seminarskirad.biz/seminarski/milan%20shufflay-izabrani_politicki_spisi.pdf Milan Šufflay. Selected Political Writings, [[Matica hrvatska]], Zagreb, 2000., ed. Dubravko Jelčić, Miljan Šufflay's Chronicle, p. 26.-29., retrieved 17 January 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

Šufflay became a historian of the [[Balkans]] and was convinced that the history of the [[Croats]] can be properly researched only from that perspective. His conviction clashed with the prevailing opinion of Croatian historians that the Croats were representatives of the West, as opposed to the Balkans. Ignoring the proposal of the university senate, [[Ban (title)|Ban]] [[Pavao Rauch]] appointed him a university professor in Zagreb in 1908. However, when [[Nikola Tomašić]], his distant cousin and enemy, became a Ban in 1910, Šufflay had to leave the university. In early 1915 he was drafted, but university professors were exempt from military duty. He was soon released because of illness, and he wrote his most important works in that period.

==Politics==

In the new state, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], he was arrested for high treason and charged with spying for a foreign power together with [[Ivo Pilar]], another Croatian historian. Their defense lawyer was [[Ante Pavelić]], at the time a leader of the [[Party of Rights (1861-1929)|Party of Rights]] and an associate of Šufflay.&lt;ref name="Matković-1962"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.historiografija.hr/hz/1962/HZ_15_3_MATKOVIC.pdf | language = Croatian | first = Hrvoje | last = Matković | title = Veze između frankovaca i radikala od 1922–1925 | journal = Historical Journal | publisher = Croatian Historical Society | issn = 0351-2193 | pages = 41–59 | year = 1962 | number = 15 | volume = 3 | accessdate = 2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Šufflay was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. The reaction to the sentence was stronger abroad than in Croatia, as scientific colleagues from numerous countries tried to obtain his release but without success. He did his time in the [[Sremska Mitrovica prison]]. After serving over half of his sentence, he was released from prison in 1922 and he returned to his scientific work.

In 1924, Šufflay wrote his first science fiction novel, ''On the Pacific in 2255'', which is considered the first [[science fiction in Croatia|Croatian science fiction]] novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crosf.nosf.net/about/science-fiction-in-croatia/ |author=[[Aleksandar Žiljak]] |title=Science Fiction in Croatia - The Beginnings |work=crosf.nosf.net |accessdate=2012-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724201627/http://crosf.nosf.net/about/science-fiction-in-croatia/ |archivedate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Šufflay became a member of the leadership of the Pure Party of Rights, a rightwing Croatian political party inspired by the work of [[Josip Frank]], a fervent nationalist. The party had reportedly not managed to win more than a few seats in the 300-strong legislative.

In 1928, when [[Stjepan Radić]] was assassinated in the Yugoslav parliament, a year before king [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]] would establish his dictatorship, Šufflay wrote ''Hrvatska u svijetlu svjetske historije i politike'' (Croatia in the Light of World History and Politics). He wrote that the Croatian people was suffering under the Yugoslav dictatorship and that it had to free itself. He claimed that the border between Western and the Eastern Civilisations lay on the [[Drina]] river, the "destined borderline on the Drina river on which the mighty Roman Empire snapped into two... a border both spiritual and cultural".

:''The Croatian people have passed through the Roman-Western retort, while the Serbian people passed through the Byzantine-Turkish. Therefore the psyche of the two peoples is essentially different, even if the languages are similar. Unification of the two peoples would mean neutralization and careful constraining. To centralize here would mean to make Croatia a guinea pig for vivisection experiments. It is my thesis that the Croatian nation, as a citizen of the great empire of the western civilization, has the right to raise its voice against any oppression.''
:''Those who know history know that the Yugoslav idea has no dynamics. It is nothing compared to the mighty Croatian idea. In Croatia, the Yugoslav idea is a shallow wreckage under which the Croatian national volcano boils; only a subtle push is necessary to make it erupt.''
:''To me personally, as a philosopher and an open-minded Croat, it is the same whether I sit shackled at the court or a penitentiary, or whether I get out into the false freedom hiding the larger dungeon in which – thank God, only temporarily! – the Croatian nation is suffering!''

Šufflay's idea about the delineation on the Drina river would later influence [[Greater Croatia]]n irredentism.

In 1928, he was appointed a professor at the [[University of Budapest]], but he could not take the job because he did not hold a passport.&lt;ref name="Švab-1999"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.matica.hr/MH_Periodika/vijenac/1999/149/html/esej/12.htm | title = Milan pl.

On the request of the [[Albania]]n government and the Academy of Sciences in [[Vienna]], he continued the work of Jireček and Thalloczy, editing the 3rd book of ''Codex albanicus'', an archival collection. In 1931, he finally obtained a passport and travelled to Albania to sign a contract to work on ''Acta Albaniae''.&lt;ref name="Švab-1999"/&gt;

==Murder==

Members of the regime organisation, Young Yugoslavia, under royal protection, ambushed him at his doorstep in Zagreb and broke his skull with a hammer, killing him. Then, they broke into his apartment and took the manuscript of the third book of ''Codex albanicus''. There was never any investigation about the criminals. The authorities denied any knowledge of the assailants and banned activities related to Šufflay's funeral.

[[Albert Einstein]] and [[Heinrich Mann]] sent a letter to the [[International League for Human Rights]] in [[Paris]] appealing to the global cultural public to protest against the murder of Milan Šufflay appealing for protection of Croat scientists from the Yugoslavian regime.
The appeal was addressed to the Paris-based ''[[Ligue des droits de l'homme]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://francecroatie.free.fr/Histoire/1934.pdf Realite sur l'attentat de Marseille contre le roi Alexandre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326055101/http://francecroatie.free.fr/Histoire/1934.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Human Rights League) and made the front page of the ''[[New York Times]]'' on 6 May 1931.&lt;ref name="NYT04.06.31"&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/1931/05/06/archives/einstein-accuses-yugoslavian-rulers-in-savants-murder-charges-the.html?sq=sufflay%2520einstein&amp;scp=1&amp;st=cse Einstein accuses Yugoslavian rulers in savant's murder]'', [[New York Times]]. 6 May 1931.

In June 1940, in the [[Banovina of Croatia]], a trial was organized for Šufflay's murder.&lt;ref name="Matković-1962"/&gt;

The murderers were the police agents Belošević and Zwerger, who fled to [[Belgrade]]. All later attempts of the Banovina of Croatia to have them extradited were fruitless.

The '''National Museum of Singapore''' is the oldest [[museum in Singapore]]. Its history dates back to 1849, when it was started as a section of a library at [[Singapore Institution]] and called the '''Raffles Library and Museum'''. After several relocations, in 1887 it moved to its permanent site at [[Stamford Road]] in the [[Museum Planning Area]].

The museum focuses on exhibits related to the [[history of Singapore]]. It is one of four national museums in the country, the other three being the two [[Asian Civilisations Museum]]s at [[Empress Place Building]] and [[Old Tao Nan School]], and the [[Singapore Art Museum]]. It was named the ''National Museum of Singapore'' in 1965; between 1993 and March 2006, it was known as the '''Singapore History Museum'''. 

The National Museum of Singapore underwent a three-and-a-half-year restoration and reopened on 2 December 2006, with the official reopening by former President of Singapore [[S. R. Nathan]] and the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts taking place on 7 December 2006.&lt;ref name="Clara Chow"&gt;Clara Chow, "National Museum opens after $132m makeover", ''[[The Straits Times]]'', 8 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Singapore History Gallery opened on 8 December of the same year.

==History==
[[File:National Museum of Singapore 3, Dec 06.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The eastern wing]]
The museum was established in 1849 by the then [[Singapore Institution Committee]]. It was called the ''Raffles Library and Museum'' and exhibited items of historical and archaeological value from Singapore and elsewhere in Asia. The museum was part of an establishment of a public repository of knowledge of Malayan in a school, museum and library. This objective can be traced to an 1823 meeting called by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]] to discuss a revival of the region's cultural heritage. The museum occupied a section of the library of the [[Singapore Institution]], later became the [[Raffles Institution]]. In 1874, the museum moved to the Town Hall (now known as the [[Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall]]). However, due to the growing collection in the museum, it moved back to the Singapore Institution in 1876 situated at the new wing of the institution.

The Raffles Library and Museum later moved to [[Stamford Road]] in a new building that was commissioned by the colonial government in 1882. The museum was officially opened on 12 October 1887 which also marked the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]]. The library was referred to by the locals in Malay as ''Rumah Kitab'' (''house of books'') or ''Tempat Kitab'' (''place of books''). The museum was designed by [[Henry McCallum|Sir Henry McCallum]] but a scaled down version was used as the Colonial Office rejected the initial proposal, Major [[J.F. McNair]] co-designed the later version.

In its early years, the museum was well known for its [[zoological]] and [[ethnographic]] collections of Southeast Asia especially [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and [[British Borneo]] before the [[World War II]]. The museum was a centre of research and knowledge, directors and [[curator]]s were by and specialists of good research accomplishments including [[zoologist]]s [[Richard Hanitsch]], John Moulton, [[Cecil Boden Kloss]], [[Frederick Nutter Chasen|Frederick Chasen]] and [[anthropologist]]s [[HD Collings]] and [[Gibson-Hill]] who were also interested in [[ornithology]], [[History of Malaya|Malay history]], [[ethnography]] and photography. The museum was the seat of the editorial office of the [[Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society]], it was visited by scholars who were en route to their trips to Malaya and [[Indonesia]]. The collections included a selection of northern [[Nias]] objects from the [[field trip]]s of [[Elio Modigliani]], as well as the basketwork gifted by Dr [[William Louis Abbott|William Abbott]], who collected them during the 1900s for the United States National Museum, later the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

Extensions were carried out in 1906, 1916, 1926 and 1934 due to the inadequate space for the growing number of times ti. L and books. During the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Japanese Occupation]], the place was left intact by the Japanese occupying army due to the reputation of its Raffles collection and research integrity. The museum split from the library, with the latter forming the [[Old National Library Building|National Library]] adjacent to the museum building in 1960 which was demolished and relocated to [[Victoria Street, Singapore|Victoria Street]] in 2005, the former was housed in the Stamford Road building.

After Singapore's independence in 1965, the museum focused its collection to nation-building and the history of Singapore and was renamed the National Museum. Its zoological collections was moved to the biology department of the [[National University of Singapore]] and to some museums such as in [[Kolkata]] in India and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in Malaysia. This all happened in 1969. Its most iconic artefact was the skeleton of a [[blue whale]] found in [[Port Dickson]] in 1893 and was displayed from 1903 to 1969. The museum then featured exhibits on history, ethnology and [[arts]] of Singapore and the region.

[[Hawpar Group]] donated a [[jade]] collection in January 1980. Restoration works of the building were carried out in 1985 which included a repainting of the building and restoring some of the distinctive features. After restoration, the museum was gazetted as a [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monument]] on 14 February 1992. The museum came under the management of the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]] in 1993 and was renamed the Singapore History Museum becoming the flagship of the four national museums in Singapore. The building was closed in April 2003 for extension and restoration works and the museum was temporarily relocated to [[Riverside Point]] where an exhibition known as ''Rivertales'' was displayed.

===Redevelopment works===
[[File:National Museum of Singapore 5.JPG|thumb|The dome consists of 3,000 zinc fish-scaled tiles and [[stained glass]] panels.]]
[[File:Singapore National Museum Passageway.jpg|thumb|upright|The Glass Passage.]]
The National Museum building was closed for a period of three and a half years and museum operation was temporarily located at Riverside Point. The building underwent a [[Singapore dollar|S$]]132.6 million revamp with a new annexe block behind the building on the site, which was formerly the demolished Drama Centre. Its new wing is partially built on ground hollowed out from nearby [[Fort Canning Hill]], and a 30-metre deep diaphragm wall was built to prevent subsidence.  A [[foundation stone]] ceremony was held on 25 November 2004 and it was then the museum publicly announced the name change. The structural top out ceremony was on 28 November 2005 and the new building is twice as large as the old one. The temporary museum at Riverside closed its operation on 6 March 2006 and the new museum reopened on 7 December 2006.

Poor restoration works in the 1980s cost some of its architecture features to be hidden or badly damaged. The fish scaled tiles were all taken down and cleaned, all 3,000 tiles were individually numbered to allow it to be replaced in the correct sequence. Every row of tiles was shaped differently, so as to match the curves of the dome. Badly restored tiles were removed and new replaced tiles were made in the original [[zinc]] material used in the old 19th century tiles made in [[Manchester]], England. The tiles had deteriorated badly due to the effects of [[acid rain]]. A [[titanium]]-zinc-based coating was used to protect the new tiles, to prevent further [[oxidation]] and [[erosion]].

On the building's dome, there are stained glass panels, these panels were all taken down, inspected and cleaned. These panels had deteriorated due to its age and the effects of gravity on the lead works. Each panel had to be transported in a special mould and sent to a stained glass restorer who used 18th century [[reinforcement]] techniques to restore the lead and glass works; the process took four months to complete. Modern staircases have been installed in the building to contrast the old and new. A spiral staircase which leads to the roof of the old museum building was restored. The windows and doors were conserved and the original type and size of timber and 18th century carpentry techniques were used to restore the timber windows and doors. Some of the original timber works used huge timber sections made of [[kapur]] wood. These sections required about four months to source, supply, fumigate, treat, cut and deliver to the site.

The [[balustrade]]s on the second floor of the old rotunda were patterned after those in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. The details of the balustrades were hidden after years of paint. The old paint was removed and a special clear coat was applied to prevent rusting of the wrought iron and to allow the details to be visible. [[Plaster work]]s were carried out on the plaster [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], [[cornice]]s, balustrades, capitals and carving of the old building were either deteriorated or destroyed during the earlier renovations. Skilled [[artisan]]s from [[India]] were brought in to recreate the plaster works which include restoring many of the windows, doors and cornices.

Its largest work done was the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|coat of arms of Queen Victoria]] and the entire northern facade which had been destroyed. An ornate rose timber ceiling rose in the original galleries were hidden by false ceilings constructed for air-conditioning in the 1980s. The rear of the building had few windows and replicas had to be made for windows facing Fort Canning and timber wood was imported from [[Indonesia]]. A 22-metre long and 11-metre high glass connector replaced a hard ceiling for visitors to view the museum's dome from the museum itself, whereas previously, one had to view the entire dome across Stamford Road.

==Facilities==

[[File:National Museum of Singapore, panorama, Aug 06.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Interior of the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], topped by a [[dome]].]]
The museum will have a permanent 2,800 m² gallery space at the new glass clad building within a glass rotunda known as the [[Singapore History Gallery]]. It will feature the [[history of Singapore]] from the 14th century in a story-telling approach. Images and film can be projected on its 15-metre high cylindrical walls. There will be a narration of the history and display of artistic expressions of the history.

A [[Inclined plane|ramp]] spiral in the new building leads down to an exhibition space holding the nation's treasures which includes the [[Singapore Stone]] and 14th century gold ornaments unearthed from nearby [[Fort Canning Hill]] in 1928. There will be a 250-seat auditorium known as ''The Mesh'' for [[:wikt:colloquium|talk]]s, lectures and workshops for the young and old at the Fort Canning entrance. It will have retail facilities as well as a café and a restaurant at the Stamford Road block of the building. Elevators and escalators have been constructed at the museum with access for the disabled. An area will feature classrooms and outreach programmes. A vehicular entrance can be accessed by [[Fort Canning Road]] at the new building. In the basement, there is a column-free 1,200 m² exhibition gallery for temporary exhibits. It has insulated walls without windows and the space is climatically controlled to protect the exhibits from light and heat or humidity changes.

A resource centre will be housed in the building which will contain old books, photographs, [[negative (photography)|negatives]] and [[Postage stamps|stamp]]s for public viewing. It had been fitted with [[Wireless@SG]] items.

==Artifacts==
The museum used to house a vast collection of zoological items, but were transferred to the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS) and other museums in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. It currently has eleven precious artefacts, namely the [[Singapore Stone]], the [[Gold Ornaments of the Sacred Hill]] from East [[Java]], [[Dagguerreotype of Singapore Town]] which was one of the earliest photographs of Singapore, the [[Will (law)|will]] of [[Munshi Abdullah]], the portrait of [[Frank Athelstane Swettenham]], the hearse of [[Tan Jiak Kim]], a [[Peranakan]] coffin cover, the mace of the City of Singapore commemorating [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]'s raising of the island's status to a city in 1951, the ''[[Xin Sai Le]]'' puppet stage, [[William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings|William Farquhar's drawings of flora and fauna]] and the portrait of [[Shenton Thomas]], who was the former governor of Singapore. [[Rock (geology)|Rocks]] from the nearby Fort Canning Hill were used to create two sculptures commissioned from [[Cultural Medallion]]-winner [[Han Sai Por]].

===National Treasures of Singapore===
Unlike countries such as [[South Korea]] or [[Japan]], there is no central authority which maintains and awards a national treasure status for these artifacts. The National Museum of Singapore, being the custodian of most of these "[[National Treasures of Singapore|national treasures]]" and the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]] being the coordinating authority of history in Singapore have at different times, came up with different lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lim|first=Wei Chean|title=Singapore's Treasures|publisher=''[[The Straits Times]]''|date=31 January 2006}} The other ten national treasures are: (1) a 1904 portrait of Sir [[Frank Swettenham|Frank Athelstane Swettenham]], the first Resident General of the [[Federated Malay States]], by [[John Singer Sargent]]; (2) the last will and testament of [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir|Munshi Abdullah]], the father of modern Malay literature; (3) the mace of the City of Singapore (1953) that was presented by Chinese philanthropist [[Loke Wan Tho]] in conjunction with [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] granting Singapore a Royal Charter in 1951, raising its status to a city; (4) an 1844 [[daguerreotype]] of the view from Fort Canning Hill by French customs service officer Alphonse-Eugene Jules, one of the earliest photographic images of Singapore; (5) 14th-century gold armlets and rings in East Javanese style, found at Fort Canning Hill in 1928; (6) a 1939 portrait of Sir [[Shenton Thomas]], the last [[List of Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor of the Straits Settlements]], by painter [[Xu Beihong]]; (7) a collection of 477 natural history drawings of flora and fauna in [[Melaka]] commissioned by Resident of Singapore [[William Farquhar]] in the 19th century; (8) a wooden hearse used for the funeral of Chinese philanthropist Tan Jiak Kim in 1917; (9) an early 20th-century embroidered Chinese coffin cover, one of the largest of its kind in existence in Singapore; and (10) a glove puppet stage belonging to the [[Fujian]] puppet troupe, Xin Sai Le, which came to Singapore in the 1930s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Top Twelve Artefacts|url=http://www.nhb.gov.sg/WWW/top12.html|publisher=[[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]]|accessdate=17 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614224406/http://www.nhb.gov.sg/WWW/top12.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:SNM Concourse.jpg|thumb|210px|left|The Concourse of the museum, an amalgamation between Classicism &amp; Modernism.]]
National Museum was designed in [[Neo-Palladian]] and [[Renaissance]] style and consists of two rectangular parallel blocks, with a [[dome]] at the front of the building. Its architects were Henry McCallum who designed the original version and J.F. McNair who designed the scaled down version of the building. The building has two [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]s, a new glass-clad rotunda at the rear area of the building. Its glass rotunda is a cylindrical shaped building which is made up of two drums, with the outer one made of glass which sheaths an inner one made of wire mesh. Black out curtains has the same length of the inner drum with images projected on sixteen video projectors in the day. The curtains are drawn after sunset, and projection can be beamed out through the glass to get a view of the city. [[Coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Coats of arms]] are found on the building's front.

The redeveloped building was designed by local [[W Architects]] with the glass-clad rotunda designed inspired by Chinese American [[Ieoh Ming Pei|I.M. Pei]]. The chief design consultant was Mok Wei Wei from W Architects, who was appointed in June 2004 and modified the designs of glass rotunda and the atrium between the two buildings. The new glass clad building was designed such that the old building would still be the centrepiece of the museum. A six-metre gap exists between the back of the main museum building and its new annexe as conservation guidelines do not allow old and new buildings to be directly connected. In the gallery theatre, bricks are designed in a [[herringbone pattern|herringbone]] brick pattern, which helps to control the echoes and acoustics in the space. Initially, the designers planned to use bricks from the old [[National Library, Singapore|National Library]] building, but the cost was too expensive. Black concrete flooring was used for the new block instead of grey [[granite]] flooring as initially planned.

'''Richard Bryn Williams''', or Bryn Williams (1902&amp;ndash;1981), was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] writer, poet, playwright and historian.

== Biography ==
Williams was born in [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]], [[Gwynedd]], [[Wales]].  When he was seven years old, his family moved to [[Trelew]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]]. He returned to Wales in 1923 and studied at the University College of North Wales (now [[Bangor University]]). He became an expert on Patagonian history and was a major contributor to the province's literature.

He was a supporter of the [[National Eisteddfod]], as well as competing in the cultural festival itself, and won the chair both in 1964 and 1968, and from 1975 to 1978 he was [[archdruid]], using the bardic name ''Bryn''. Almost all of his numerous works reflect the life of Patagonia and its history.

'''Rostow's Stages of Economic Growth''' model is one of the major historical models of [[economic growth]]. It was published by American economist [[Walt Whitman Rostow]] in 1960. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt;

# Traditional society
# Transitional society 
# Take-off
# Drive to technological maturity
# High mass consumption 

Rostow's model is one of the more [[structuralism|structuralist]] models of economic growth, particularly in comparison with the "[[backwardness]]" model developed by [[Alexander Gerschenkron]], although the two models are not mutually exclusive.

Rostow argued that economic take-off must initially be led by a few individual [[economic sector]]s. This belief echoes [[David Ricardo]]'s [[comparative advantage]] thesis and criticizes [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionaries' push for economic self-reliance in that it pushes for the "initial" development of only one or two sectors over the development of all sectors equally. This became one of the important concepts in the [[theory of modernization]] in [[social evolutionism]].

== Overview ==

Below is an outline of Rostow's Five Stages of Growth:
* '''Traditional Society'''
** characterized by subsistence agriculture or [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]; almost wholly a "primary" sector economy
** limited technology
** Some advancements and improvements to processes, but limited ability for economic growth because of the absence of modern technologies, lack of class or individual economic mobility, with stability prioritized and change seen negatively 
** This is where society generally begins before progressing towards the next stages of growth
** No centralized nations or political systems.
* '''Pre-conditions to "take-off"'''
** External demand for raw materials initiates economic change.
** Development of more productive, commercial agriculture and cash crops not consumed by producers and/or largely exported.
** Widespread and enhanced investment in changes to the physical environment to expand production (i.e. irrigation, canals, ports)
** Increasing spread of technology and advances in existing technologies
** Changing social structure, with previous social equilibrium now in flux
** Individual social mobility begins
** Development of national identity and shared economic interests.
*'''Take-off'''
** Urbanization increases, industrialization proceeds, technological breakthroughs occur.
** "Secondary" (goods-producing) sector expands and ratio of secondary vs. primary sectors in the economy shifts quickly towards secondary.
** Textiles and apparel are usually the first "take-off" industry, as happened in Great Britain's classic "[[Industrial Revolution]]"
** An Example of the Take-off phase is the Agriculture (Green) Revolution in the 1960s.
* '''Drive to Maturity'''
** Diversification of the industrial base; multiple industries expand and new ones take root quickly
** Manufacturing shifts from investment-driven (capital goods) towards consumer durables and domestic consumption
** Rapid development of transportation infrastructure.
** Large-scale investment in social infrastructure (schools, universities, hospitals, etc.)
* '''Age of Mass Consumption'''
** the industrial base dominates the economy; the primary sector is of greatly diminished weight in economy and society
** widespread and normative consumption of high-value consumer goods (e.g. automobiles)
** consumers typically (if not universally), have disposable income, beyond all basic needs, for additional goods
** Urban society (a movement away from rural countrysides to the cities)
*'''Beyond consumption'''
**age of diminishing relative marginal utility as well as an age for durable consumer goods
**large families and Americans feel as if they were born into a society that has high economic security and high consumption 
**a stage where its merely speculation on whether there is further consumer diffusion or what the new generation will bring for growth

Rostow claimed that these stages of growth were designed to tackle a number of issues, some of which he identified himself, writing: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Under what impulses did traditional, agricultural societies begin the process of their modernization? When and how did regular growth become a built-in feature of each society? What forces drove the process of sustained growth along and determined its contours? What common social and political features of the growth process may be discerned at each stage? What forces have determined relations between the more developed and less developed areas; and what relation if any did the relative sequence of growth bear to outbreak of war? And finally where is compound interest taking us? Is it taking us to communism; or to the affluent suburbs, nicely rounded out with social overhead capital; to destruction; to the moon; or where?"&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rostow asserts that countries go through each of these stages fairly linearly, and set out a number of conditions that were likely to occur in [[investment]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], and social trends at each state. Not all of the conditions were certain to occur at each stage, however, and the stages and transition periods may occur at varying lengths from country to country, and even from region to region.&lt;ref&gt;Rostow emphasizes in ''Stages'' that "the stages of growth are an arbitrary and limited way of looking at the sequence of modern history: ... to dramatize not merely the uniformities in the sequence of modernization but also—and equally—the uniqueness of each nation's experience."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical Framework ==

Rostow's model is a part of the [[liberal economics|liberal school of economics]], laying emphasis on the efficacy of modern concepts of [[free trade]] and the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. It disagrees with [[Friedrich List]]'s argument which states that economies which rely on exports of raw materials may get "locked in", and would not be able to diversify, regarding this Rostow's model states that economies may need to depend on raw material exports to finance the development of industrial sector which has not yet of achieved superior level of competitiveness in the early stages of take-off. Rostow's model does not disagree with [[John Maynard Keynes]] regarding the importance of government control over domestic development which is not generally accepted by some ardent free trade advocates. The basic assumption given by Rostow is that countries want to modernize and grow and that society will agree to the [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] norms of economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lewishistoricalsociety.com/wiki/tiki-print_article.php?articleId=66 |title=Rostow's Stages of Development vs. Self- Sufficiency |publisher=Lewis historical society |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of Development Process ==

=== Traditional Societies ===

An economy in this stage has an unlimited production function which barely attains the minimum level of potential output.  This does not entirely mean that the economy's production level is static.  The output level can still be increased, as there was often a surplus of uncultivated land which can be used for increasing agricultural production. Modern science and technology has yet to be introduced. As a result, these pre-Newtonian societies, unaware of the possibilities to manipulate the external world, rely heavily on manual labor and self-sufficiency to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto|last=Rostow|first=W. W.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; States and individuals utilize irrigation systems in many instances, but most farming is still purely for subsistence.  There have been technological innovations, but only on ad hoc basis. All of that this can result in increases in output, but never beyond an upper limit which cannot be crossed. Trade is predominantly regional and local, largely done through barter, and the monetary system is not well developed.  Investment's share never exceeds 5% of total economic production.

Wars, famines and epidemics like plague cause initially expanding populations to halt or shrink, limiting the single greatest factor of production: human manual labor.  Volume fluctuations in trade due to political instability are frequent; historically, trading was subject to great risk and transport of goods and raw materials was expensive, difficult, slow and unreliable. The manufacturing sector and other industries have a tendency to grow but are limited by inadequate scientific knowledge and a "backward" or highly traditionalist frame of mind which contributes to low labour productivity. In this stage, some regions are entirely self-sufficient.

In settled agricultural societies before the Industrial Revolution, a hierarchical social structure relied on near-absolute reverence for tradition, and an insistence on obedience and submission.  This resulted in concentration of political power in the hands of landowners in most cases; everywhere, family and lineage, and marriage ties, constituted the primary social organization, along with religious customs, and the state only rarely interacted with local populations and in limited spheres of life.  This social structure was generally feudalistic in nature.  Under modern conditions, these characteristics have been modified by outside influences, but the least developed regions and societies fit this description quite accurately..

=== Pre-conditions for Take-off ===

In the second stage of economic growth the economy undergoes a process of change for building up of conditions for growth and take off. [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] said that these changes in society and the economy had to be of fundamental nature in the socio-political structure and production techniques.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt; This pattern was followed in Europe, parts of Asia, the Middle East and Africa. There is also a second or third pattern in which he said that there was no need for change in socio-political structure because these economies were not deeply caught up in older, traditional social and political structures. The only changes required were in economic and technical dimensions.  The nations which followed this pattern were in North America and Oceania (New Zealand and Australia).

There are three important dimensions to this transition: firstly, the shift from an agrarian to an industrial or manufacturing society begins, albeit slowly. Secondly, trade and other commercial activities of the nation broaden the market's reach not only to neighboring areas but also to far-flung regions, creating international markets. Lastly, the surplus attained should not be wasted on the [[conspicuous consumption]] of the land owners or the state, but should be spent on the development of industries, infrastructure and thereby prepare for self-sustained growth of the economy later on. Furthermore, agriculture becomes commercialized and mechanized via technological advancement; shifts increasingly towards cash or export-oriented crops; and there is a growth of agricultural entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brett Wallace |url=http://www.slideshare.net/geographyalltheway/ib-geography-develpent-rostow-model |title=IB Geography: Development: Rostow Model |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategic factor is that investment level should be above 5% of the [[national income]]. This rise in investment rate depends on many sectors of the economy. According to [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Rostow]] capital formation depends on the productivity of agriculture and the  creation of social overhead capital.  Agriculture plays a very important role in this transition process as the surplus quantity of the produce is to be utilized to support an increasing urban population of workers and also becomes a major exporting sector, earning foreign exchange for continued development and capital formation. Increases in agricultural productivity also lead to expansion of the domestic markets for manufactured goods and processed commodities, which adds to the growth of investment in the industrial sector.

Social overhead capital creation can only be undertaken by government, in Rostow's view.  Government plays the driving role in development of social overhead capital as it is rarely profitable, it has a long gestation period, and the pay-offs accrue to all economic sectors, not primarily to the investing entity; thus the private sector is not interested in playing a major role in its development.

All these changes effectively prepare the way for "take-off" only if there is basic change in attitude of society towards risk taking, changes in working environment, and openness to change in social and political organisations and structures.
According to Rostow, the preconditions to take-off begins from an external intervention by more developed and advanced societies, which "set in motion ideas and sentiments which initiated the process by which a modern alternative to the traditional society was constructed out of the old culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seligso|first=Mitchell A.|title=The Five Stages of Growth W.W. Rostow|journal=Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality|date=|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-conditions of take-off closely track the historic stages of the (initially) British Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; 

Referring to the '''graph''' of savings and investment, notably, there is a steep increase in the rate of savings and investment from the stage of "Pre Take-off" till "Drive to Maturity:" then, following that stage, the growing rate of savings and investment moderates.  This initial and accelerating steep increase in savings and investment is a pre-condition for the economy to reach the "Take-off" stage and far beyond.

=== Take-off ===

This stage is characterized by dynamic economic growth. As Rostow suggests, all is premised on a sharp stimulus (or multiple stimuli) that is/are any or all of economic, political and technological change. The main feature of this stage is rapid, self-sustained growth.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt; Take-off occurs when [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]] led growth becomes common and society is driven more by economic processes than traditions. At this point, the norms of economic growth are well established and growth becomes a nation's "second nature" and a shared goal.&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt; In discussing the take-off, Rostow is noted to have adopted the term "transition", which describes the process of a traditional economy becoming a modern one. After take-off, a country will generally take as long as fifty to one hundred years to reach the mature stage according to the model, as occurred in countries that participated in the Industrial Revolution and were established as such when Rostow developed his ideas in the 1950s.

Per Rostow there are three main requirements for take-off:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The rate of productive investment should rise from approximately 5% to over 10% of national income or net national product&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;2. The development of one or more substantial manufacturing sectors, with a high rate of growth;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;3. The existence or quick emergence of a political, social and institutional framework which exploits the impulses to expansion in the modern sector and the potential external economy effects of the take-off.&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The third requirement implies that the needed capital must be mobilized from domestic resources and steered into the economy, rather than into domestic or state consumption.Industrialization becomes a crucial phenomenon as it helps to prepare the basic structure for structural changes on a massive scale.  Rostow says that this transition does not follow a set trend as there are a variety of different motivations or stimulus which began this growth process.
Take off requires a large and sufficient amount of loanable funds for expansion of the industrial sector which generally come from two sources which are:
#Shifts in income flows by way of taxation, implementation of land reforms and various other fiscal measures.
#Re-investment of profits earned from foreign trade as has been observed in many East Asian countries.  While there are other examples of "Take-off" based on rapidly increasing demand for domestically produced goods for sale in domestic markets, more countries have followed the export-based model, overall and in the recent past.  The US, Canada, Russia and Sweden are examples of domestically based "take-off"; all of them, however, were characterized by massive capital imports and rapid adoption of their trading partners' technological advances.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040618120100/http://www.nvcc.edu/home/nvfordc/econdev/introduction/stages.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-06-18 |title=Stages of Development |publisher=Nvcc.edu |date=2004-04-22 |accessdate=2014-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This entire process of expansion of the industrial sector yields an increase in rate of return to some individuals who save at high rates and invest their savings in the industrial sector activities. The economy exploit their underutilized natural resources to increase their production.&lt;ref name="mth"/&gt;

[[File:table for take-off.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative take-off dates&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;]]

The take-off also needs a group of entrepreneurs in the society who pursue innovation and accelerate the rate of growth in the economy.  For such an entrepreneurial class to develop, firstly, an ethos of "delayed gratification", a preference for capital accumulation over expenditure, and high tolerance of risk must be present. Secondly, entrepreneurial groups typically develop because they can not secure prestige and power in their society via marriage, via participating in well-established industries, or through government or military service (among other routes to prominence) because of some disqualifying social or legal attribute; and lastly, their rapidly changing society must tolerate unorthodox paths to economic and political power.

The ability of a country to make it through this stage depends on the following major factors:
*Existence of enlarged, sustained effective demand for the product of key sectors.
*Introduction of new productive technologies and techniques in these sectors.
*The society's increasing capacity to generate or earn enough capital to complete the take-off transition.
*Activities in the key sector should induce a chain of growth in other sectors of the economy, that also develop rapidly.

An example of a country in the Take-off stage of development is Equatorial Guinea. It has the largest increases in GDP growth since 1980 and the rate of productive investment has risen from 5% to over 10% of income or product.

In the table note that Take-off periods of different countries are the same as the industrial revolution in those countries.

=== Drive to Maturity ===

After take-off, there follows a long interval of sustained growth known as the stage of drive to maturity. Rostow defines it "as the period when a society has effectively applied the range of modern technology to the bulk of its resources."&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MP" /&gt; Now regularly growing economy drives to extend modern technology over the whole front of its economic activity. Some 10-20% of the national income is steadily invested, permitting output regularly to outstrip the increase in population. The makeup of the economy changes unceasingly as technique improves, new industries accelerate, older industries level off. The economy finds its place in the international economy: goods formerly imported are produced at home; new import requirements develop, and new export commodities to match them. The leading sectors in an economy will be determined by the nature of resource endowments and not only by technology.

[[File:table for drive to maturity.jpg|thumb|300px|Tentative drive to maturity dates&lt;ref name="WWR" /&gt;]]
On comparing the dates of take-off and drive to maturity, these countries reached the stage of maturity in approximately 60 years.

The structural changes in the society during this stage are in three ways:
* Work force composition in agriculture shifts from 75% of the working population to 20%. The workers acquire greater skill and their wages increase in real terms.
* The character of leadership changes significantly in the industries and a high degree of professionalism is introduced
* Environmental and health cost of industrialization is recognized and policy changes are thus made.
During this stage a country has to decide whether the industrial power and technology it has generated is to be used for the welfare of its people or to gain supremacy over others, or the world ''in toto''.

A prime example of a country in the Drive to Maturity stage is South Africa. It is developing a world-class infrastructure- including a modern transport network, widely available energy, and sophisticated telecommunications facilities. Additionally, the commercial farm sector shed 140,000 jobs, a decline of roughly 20%, in the eleven-year period from 1988 to 1998.

This diversity leads to reduction in poverty rate and increasing standards of living, as the society no longer needs to sacrifice its comfort in order to build up certain sectors.&lt;ref name="rl" /&gt;

=== Age of High Mass Consumption ===

The age of high mass consumption refers to the period of contemporary comfort afforded many western nations, wherein consumers concentrate on [[durable good]]s, and hardly remember the subsistence concerns of previous stages. Rostow uses the Buddenbrooks dynamics metaphor to describe this change in attitude. In [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1901 novel, ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', a family is chronicled for three generations. The first generation is interested in economic development, the second in its position in society. The third, already having money and prestige, concerns itself with the [[arts]] and [[music]], worrying little about those previous, earthly concerns. So too, in the age of high mass consumption, a society is able to choose between concentrating on [[military]] and [[security]] issues, on [[social equality|equality]] and [[Social welfare|welfare]] issues, or on developing great [[luxuries]] for its upper class. Each country in this position chooses its own balance between these three goals.  There is a desire to develop an egalitarian society and measures are taken to reach this goal.  According to Rostow, a country tries to determine its uniqueness and factors affecting it are its political, geographical and cultural structure and also values present in its society.&lt;ref name="rl" /&gt;

Historically, the United States is said to have reached this stage first, followed by other western European nations, and then Japan in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;

=== Dark Matter Consumption ===

This step is more of a theoretical speculation by Rostow rather than an analytical step in the process by Rostow.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beckett, Paul A. ''The Journal of Developing Areas'' 29.2 (1995): 284-86. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals begin having larger families and do not value income as a pre-requisite for more vacation days. Consumer products become more durable and more diverse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; New Americans will behave in a way where the high economic security and level mass consumption is considered normal. Rostow does make the point that it is possible with the large baby boom it could either cause economic issues or dictate an even larger diffusion of consumer goods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With increasing urban and suburban population there will be undoubtedly an increase in consumer goods and services as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticism of the model ==

# Rostow is '''historical''' in the sense that the end result is known at the outset and is derived from the historical geography of a developed, bureaucratic society.
# Rostow is '''mechanical''' in the sense that the underlying motor of change is not disclosed and therefore the stages become little more than a classificatory system based on data from developed countries.
# His model is based on American and European history and defines the American norm of high mass consumption as integral to the economic development process of all industrialized societies.
# His model assumes the inevitable adoption of [[Neoliberal]] trade policies which allow the manufacturing base of a given advanced polity to be relocated to lower-wage regions.
# Rostow's model does not apply to the Asian and the African countries as events in these countries are not justified in any stage of his model.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
# The stages are not identifiable properly as the conditions of the take-off and pre take-off stage are very similar and also overlap.
# According to Rostow growth becomes automatic by the time it reaches the maturity stage but Kuznets asserts that no growth can be automatic there is need for push always.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
# There appear to be two parallel theories of 'take-off' one is that 'take-off' is a sectoral and non-linear notion, and the other is that it is highly aggregative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Itagaki |first=Yoichi |title=Criticism of Rostow's Stage Approach: The Concept of State, System and Type |journal=The Developing Economies |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |year=1963 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1049.1963.tb01138.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rostow's thesis''' is biased towards a western model of modernization, but at the time of Rostow the world's only mature economies were in the west, and no controlled economies were in the "era of high mass consumption." The model de-emphasizes differences between sectors in capitalistic vs. communistic societies, but seems to innately recognize that modernization can be achieved in different ways in different types of economies.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Another assumption that Rostow took is of trying to fit economic progress into a linear system. This assumption is questioned due to empirical evidence of many countries making 'false starts' then reaching a degree of progress and change and then slipping back. E.g.: In the case of contemporary [[Russia]] slipping back from high mass consumption to a country in [[Transition economy|transition]].

Another criticism of Rostow's work is that it consideres large countries with a large population ([[Japan]]), with natural resources available at just the right time in its history ([[Coal]] in [[Northern Europe|Northern European countries]]), or with a large land mass ([[Argentina]]). He has little to say and indeed offers little hope for small countries, such as [[Rwanda]], which do not have such advantages. [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal economic theory]] to Rostow, and many others, does offer hope to much of the world that economic maturity is coming and the age of high mass consumption is nigh.This does leave a potential "grim meathook future" for the [[wikt:periphery|outliers]], which do not have the resources, political will, or external backing to become [[Competition (companies)|competitive]] with already developed economies.&lt;ref&gt;"Grim Meathook Future" is a quote from new media writer Joshua Ellis{{cite web|url=http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329063043/http://www.zenarchery.com/2005/09/22/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing/ |archivedate=2006-03-29 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Dependency theory]])

A '''royal descent''' is a [[genealogy|genealogical]] [[Kinship and descent|line of descent]] from a past or present [[monarch]]. 

Both [[geneticist]]s and [[genealogist]]s have attempted to estimate the percentage of living people with royal descent. From a genetical perspective, the number of unprovable descendants must be virtually unlimited if going back enough generations, according to [[coalescent theory]], as the possibility increases exponentially following every century back in time. In other words, the number of descendants from a monarch increases as a function of the length of time between the monarch's death and the birth of the particular descendant.

As for descendants of genealogical documented lineages, various estimated figures have been proposed. For instance, Mark Humphrys, a [[professor]] of [[computer science]] at [[Dublin City University]] in [[Ireland]], and [[genealogy]] enthusiast, estimate the people of provable genealogical ancestry from medieval monarchs to millions. In any case, the percentage of genealogical descendants are bound to increase with time; not only with every new generation but also due to more extensive combination of individual efforts in [[genealogy software]], including [[Comparison of web-based genealogy software|international services available online]].

In [[genealogy]], royal descent is sometimes claimed as a mark of distinction and is seen as a desirable goal. However, due to the incompleteness and varying uncertainty of existing records, the number of people who do claim royal descent tend to be higher than the number who can actually prove it.&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the Royal Historical Society: Sixth Series (Royal Historical Society Transactions) by Royal Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[pretender]]s, [[impostor#Notable impostors|impostors]] and those hoping to improve their [[social status]] have often claimed royal descent, some with fabricated lineages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progenealogists.com/greatbritain/medievalgenealogy.htm Medieval Genealogy and Family History]&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of royal descent to some genealogists has been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Conniff, Richard. "Why Genealogy is Bunk." ''Smithsonian Magazine''. July 2007. p.90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logically, for every royalty in a person's family tree, there are bound to be virtually an unlimited number of undocumented individuals whose births, deaths and lives went completely unrecorded by history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/07/05/genealogist-almost-everyone-on-earth-descended-from-royalty.html|title=Genealogist: Almost Everyone on Earth Descended From Royalty|date=5 July 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[truism]] that would naturally apply even to someone who is per se a living royalty.

From a genetical, scientifical perspective, it is theoretically true that "statistically, most of the inhabitants of [[Western Europe]] are probably descended from [[William the Conqueror]]; they are equally likely to be descended from the man who groomed his charger."&lt;ref name=lines /&gt;

==Europe==
There has been a long tradition for royalty predominantly to [[endogamy|intermarry]] those of their own class. As a result, the ruling houses of Europe have tended to be closely related to one another, and descent from a particular monarch will be found in many [[dynasty|dynasties]] – all present European monarchs, and a great many pretenders, are genealogical descendants of [[William the Conqueror]] (1028–1087), for example,&lt;ref name=lines&gt;Maclagan, Michael, ''Lines of Succession''&lt;/ref&gt; and further back in time of [[Charlemagne]] (742/747/748–814). Through Charlemagne, some researchers have even speculated on [[Descent_from_antiquity#Rome_to_Charlemagne|descent from antiquity]].

The practice of restrictive marriages has been noted as increasing over the years until the 20th century: the passage of time strengthened the conviction that royalty only allied with royalty, and from the 16th century marriages between royalty and commoner became rarer and rarer. This is one reason why descent from more recent monarchs is rarer amongst commoners than from monarchs further back.&lt;ref name=lines /&gt;

Members of untitled families today may be descended from [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] children of royalty as [[:wiktionary:primogenitor|primogenitors]]. Since illegitimate children of royalty were seldom permitted to marry into other royal families because their unacceptable status, these children tended to marry [[upper-class]] or [[middle-class]] families from their own country.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Herman. ''Sex with Kings''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Herman. ''Sex with Queens''&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
At one time, publications on this matter stressed royal connections for only a few families. One example included [[James Pierpont (Yale founder)|James Pierpont]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, CH (1891) ''Americans of Royal descent'' (via [https://books.google.com/books?id=dIUaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q=pierpont&amp;f=false Google books])&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there are NEHGS articles on [[United States presidents]] and  "tycoon" families and of royal descent that emphasize the discriminating notion,&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, GB (1988) ''Notable Kin Presidents, New England and Kings'' (via  [http://www.newenglandancestors.org/research/services/articles_7236.asp NEHGS website])&lt;/ref&gt; of which the "[[most royal candidate theory]]" is a notable result. That is, those of royal descent excel (to wit, Roberts' article on eminent descendants of Mrs. [[Alice Freeman Thompson Parke]]).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, GB () ''#68 Royal Descents, Notable Kin, and Printed Sources: Notable Descendants of Mrs. Alice Freeman Thompson Parke'' (via [http://www.newenglandancestors.org/research/services/articles_gbr68.asp NEHGS website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115053251/http://www.newenglandancestors.org/research/services/articles_gbr68.asp |date=2009-01-15 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Many, too, were at the forefront of social progress, for example, [[Anne Hutchinson#Ancestry|Anne (Marbury) Hutchinson]] who was banished from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] for her progressive beliefs.

According to American genealogist [[Gary Boyd Roberts]], an expert on royal descent, most Americans with significant [[New England]] [[Yankee]], [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] [[Quaker]], or [[American South|Southern]] [[Farmer|planter]] ancestry are descended from medieval kings, especially those of England, Scotland, and France.  [[William Addams Reitwiesner]] documented many U.S. descendants of [[Renaissance]] and modern monarchs. Some Americans may have royal descents through German immigrants who had an illegitimate descent from German royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Wollmershaüser, Friedrich R. [http://www.progenealogists.com/germany/articles/gnobility.htm German Noble Descent in American Family Tradition].&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[primogeniture]], many colonists of high social status were younger children of English [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] families who came to America looking for land because, since given their birth order they could not inherit.  Many of these immigrants initially enjoyed high standing where they settled.  They could often claim royal descent through a female line or [[illegitimacy|illegitimate descent]]. Some Americans descend from these 17th-century [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonists]]&lt;!--, particularly families that settled in the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;Tidewater Virginia Families: Generations Beyond Adding the Families of by Virginia Lee and Hutcheson Davis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genealogies of Virginia Families From Tyler's Quarterly Historical&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lines" /&gt;--&gt; who had royal descent. There were at least 650 colonists with traceable royal ancestry,&lt;ref name=roberts2&gt;[http://www.newenglandancestors.org/store/browse/product.asp?sku=715758438 Royal Descents of 600 Immigrants to the American Colonies or the United States] (NEHGS Store description page)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;[[Gary Boyd Roberts|Roberts, Gary Boyd]]. ''The Royal Descents of 600 Immigrants.'' Genealogical Publishing, 2008.[http://www.genealogical.com/products/The%20Royal%20Descents%20of%20600%20Immigrants/4963.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and 387 of them left descendants in America (almost always numbering many thousands, and some as many as one million).&lt;ref name=roberts2 /&gt; These colonists with royal descent settled in various states, but a large majority in [[Massachusetts]] or [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=roberts2/&gt; Several families which settled in those states, over the two hundred years or more since the colonial land grants, intertwined their branches to the point that almost everyone was somehow related to everyone else. As one writer observed, "like a tangle of fish hooks".&lt;ref&gt;Lady of Arlington by John Perry&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, opposing factors have affected the percentage of Americans who have provable royal descent.  The passage of the generations has further intermingled the ancestry of the English colonists' descendants, thus increasing the percentage who descend from one of the immigrants with royal ancestry.  At the same time, however, waves of post-colonial immigrants from other countries decreased the percentage who have royal descent.

==Africa==
Royal descent plays an important role in many African societies; authority and property tend to be lineally derived. Among tribes which recognize a single ruler, the hereditary blood line of the rulers (who early European travelers described as kings, queens, princes, etc., using the terminology of European monarchy) is akin to a [[dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Richards1961&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Richards, A.I.
 | year = 1961
 | title = African Kings and Their Royal Relatives
 | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute
 | volume = 91
 | issue = 2
 | pages = 135–150
 | doi = 10.2307/2844410
 | publisher = Royal Anthropological Institute
| jstor=2844410
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among groups which have less centralized power structures, dominant clans are still recognized.&lt;ref name=Richards1961 /&gt;  Oral history would be the primary method of transmitting genealogies, and both nobles and commoners base their status on descent. The royal blood is among the centralized power of all blood groups.

==Proving royal descent==
Royal descent is easier to prove than descent from less historically documented ancestors, since genealogies and public records are typically fuller, better known and preserved in the case of royal descent than in the case of descent from less noted individuals. Typically, it is only since the 20th century that family history has been an interest pursued by people outside the [[upper class]]es. Hence, the continuous lines of descent from royal ancestors are typically much better researched and established than those from other ancestors.  Until the parish record system introduced the 16th century, and [[civil registration]] in the 19th century, family records are fuller for [[landowner]]s than for ordinary people.

Between 1903 and 1911, the [[Melville Henry Massue]] published volumes titled ''The Blood Royal of Britain'' which attempted to name all the then-living descendants of King [[Edward III of England]] (1312–1377).  He gave up the exercise after publishing the names of about 40,000 living people, but his own estimate was that the total of those of royal descent who could be proved and named if he completed his work at that time was 100,000 people.  His work, however, was heavily dependent upon those whose names were readily ascertainable from works of genealogical reference, such as [[Peerages]] and [[Burke's Peerage|Burke's Landed Gentry]].

The English geneticist Professor [[Stephen Jones (geneticist)|Stephen Jones]] estimates that 25% of the British population is descended from the [[Plantagenets]].{{clarify|comment=Genetically or provably genealogically?|date=January 2017}}

Notably, the phrase "English descent" does not, of course, mean purely English descent: As soon as an immigrant family marries into an indigenous family, it acquires all the ancestors of its indigenous parent, and is therefore no less likely to be able to claim a royal descent than a non-immigrant family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4466">The '''Social Science History Association''', formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in [[social history]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''Statement of Purpose:''' To bring together members of various disciplines (including economics, sociology, demography, anthropology, and history) who work with historical materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/affiliated-societies/social-science-history-association American History Association entry for SSHA]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social Science History]] is a quarterly, peer-reviewed academic journal. It is the official journal of the Social Science History Association. Its articles bring an analytic, theoretical, and often quantitative approach to historical evidence. The journal's founders intended to "improve the quality of historical explanation" with "theories and methods from the social science disciplines" and to make generalizations across historical cases.&lt;ref name=founders&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170928 Editors' Foreword], 1976. ''Social Science History'', 1(1): i-ii&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue came out in the fall of 1976.&lt;ref name=founders/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/77640161 Library of Congress Catalog Record: Social Science History]&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's articles that are most-accessed and cited through [[JSTOR]] are about [[social movements|social]] and [[political movements]] and associated narratives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/action/showMostAccessedArticles?journalCode=socisciehist ''Social Science History'': Most accessed] at JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/action/showMostCitedArticles?journalCode=socisciehist ''Social Science History'': Most cited] at JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Social Science History Association" was formed in 1976 as an interdisciplinary group with a journal ''[[Social Science History]]'' and an annual convention. The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as critics complained that quantification undervalued the role of contingency, and warned against a naive positivism. Meanwhile quantification  became well-established inside economics, in the field of cliometrics, as well as in political science. In history, quantification remained central to demographic studies, but slipped behind in political and social history.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey J. Graff, "The Shock of the 'New’ (Histories)': Social Science Histories and Historical Literacies," ''Social Science History'' 25.4 (2001) 483-533  in Project Muse&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3413">'''Social savings''' is an growth in accounting techniques in order to [[cliometrics|evaluate]] the [[economic history|historical]] implications of new technology on economic growth.&lt;ref name="Crafts"&gt;Crafts, Nicholas F. R. (July 2004) [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/id/eprint/22554 "Social Savings as a Measure of the Contribution of a New Technology to Economic Growth".] Working Paper 06/04, Department of Economic History, [[London School of Economics]].&lt;/ref&gt; Developed in 1950 by [[United States|American]] economic historian and scientist [[Robert Fogel]], explains the [[methodology]] works to estimate the cost-savings of the new [[technology]] compared with the next best alternative.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; The first oral presentation was at the 1960 Purdue Cliometrics meeting, and the first published version was in the Journal of economic history in 1962.

A recent [[Survey data collection|survey]] can be found in "economic and history: surveys in Cliometrics", edited by David Greasley and Les Oxley and published by Wiley-Blackwell in 2011. The relevant chapter is entitled "social savings" and is by [[Tim Leunig]], [[London School of Economics]]. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2010.00636.x/abstract]

==Calculation==
The amount of social savings (SS) may be calculated as
:SS = (P&lt;sub&gt;T0&lt;/sub&gt; − P&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt;)T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
where P&lt;sub&gt;T0&lt;/sub&gt; is the price per unit of the alternative technology, P&lt;sub&gt;T1&lt;/sub&gt; is the price of the technology being evaluated. T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the quantity processed by the technology being evaluated.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; This saving in resource costs may be taken to be equal to the gain in [[Gross National Income|real national income]].&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; Two noted social savings applications include social savings analysis on the contribution of the [[Rail transport in the United States|railway]] to the 19th century economic growth and the impact of [[information technology]] to the 20th century economic growth.&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt;

== Railroads and American economic growth ==
Social savings was introduced and applied to the railroads in a seminal book by economic historian and scientist [[Robert Fogel]].&lt;ref name="Fogel64"&gt;Fogel R. (1964) ''Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History'', The Johns Hopkins University Press; 1st Edition. {{ISBN|0-8018-0201-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crafts"/&gt; The social savings analysis involved using quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 if there were no railroads.&lt;ref name="davis.shtml"&gt;[http://eh.net/bookreviews/library/davis.shtml Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History | Book Reviews | EH.Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of railroads, freight transportation by rivers and canals would have been only moderately more expensive along most common routes.  &lt;ref name="davis.shtml"/&gt; Fogel concluded that the difference in cost (or "social savings") attributable to railroads was negligible - about 2.7% of GNP. This [[counterfactual history]] view was vastly different from views proffered by railroad [[historians]] and made a controversial name for [[cliometrics]].

His dates are unknown but he came from [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] and earned the nickname ''Asoghik'' ("teller of stories"). He wrote a ''Universal History'' in three books. The first two books summarise the history of the world - with particular reference to Armenia - using the [[Bible]], [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Moses of Khoren]] and others as sources. The third book deals with the history of the century leading up to Asoghik's own time in a rather disconnected fashion.

[[File:The Fable of the Bees (1705).jpg|right|thumb|The title page of the 1705 edition of Bernard de Mandeville's ''Fable of the Bees''.]]
'''''The Fable of The Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits''''' is a book by [[Bernard Mandeville]], consisting of the poem ''The Grumbling Hive: or, Knaves turn’d Honest,'' along with prose discussion of the poem. The poem was published in 1705, and the book first appeared in 1714.&lt;ref&gt;http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=846&amp;layout=html#chapter_66840&lt;/ref&gt; The poem suggests many key principles of economic thought, including [[division of labor]] and the "[[invisible hand]]", seventy years before these concepts were more thoroughly elucidated by [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith does not cite Mandeville in "Wealth of Nations", but [[Edwin Cannan]], editor of the 1904 edition, notes in several places where Smith appears to have been influenced by Mandeville. See notes in {{Harvnb|Smith|1904}} at pp. 3, 10, 12, 14, and 102. Adam Smith was familiar with Mandeville's work early on, as he discusses it in his ''Theory of Moral Sentiments'': Part VII, Section II, Chapter 4 (‘Of licentious systems’); [https://archive.org/stream/theorymoralsent00stewgoog#page/n521/mode/2up online].&lt;/ref&gt; Two centuries later, the noted economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] cited Mandeville to show that it was "no new thing ... to ascribe the evils of unemployment to ... the insufficiency of the propensity to consume",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|1964}}, ch. 23, sec. vii, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; a condition also known as the ''[[paradox of thrift]],'' which was central to his own theory of [[effective demand]].

At the time, however, it was considered scandalous. Keynes noted that it was "convicted as a nuisance by the grand jury of Middlesex in 1723, which stands out in the history of the moral sciences for its scandalous reputation. Only one man is recorded as having spoken a good word for it, namely [[Dr. Johnson]], who declared that it did not puzzle him, but 'opened his eyes into real life very much'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|1964}}, 
[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch23.htm p.&amp;nbsp;359].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also reported that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mandeville gave great offense by this book, in which a cynical system of morality was made attractive by ingenious paradoxes. ... His doctrine that prosperity was increased by expenditure rather than by saving fell in with many current economic fallacies not yet extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen's "current economic fallacies not yet extinct" refers to [[Mercantilism]].&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming with the ascetics that human desires were essentially evil and therefore produced "private vices" and assuming with the common view that wealth was a "public benefit", he easily showed that all civilization implied the development of vicious propensities.... 
:::— &lt;small&gt;[[Leslie Stephen]], in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', quoted by {{Harvnb|Keynes|1964}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;359–560.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The poem==
The poem had appeared in 1705 and was intended as a commentary on England as Mandeville saw it. Keynes described the poem as setting forth "the appalling plight of a prosperous community in which all the citizens suddenly take it into their heads to abandon luxurious living, and the State to cut down armaments, in the interests of Saving".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keynes|1964}}, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

:A Spacious Hive well stock'd with Bees, 
:That lived in Luxury and Ease; 
:And yet as fam'd for Laws and Arms, 
:As yielding large and early Swarms; 
:Was counted the great Nursery 
:Of Sciences and Industry. 
:No Bees had better Government, 
:More Fickleness, or less Content. 
:They were not Slaves to Tyranny, 
:Nor ruled by wild Democracy; 
:But Kings, that could not wrong, because 
:Their Power was circumscrib'd by Laws.

The "hive" is corrupt but prosperous, yet it grumbles about lack of virtue. A higher power decides to give them what they ask for:

:But Jove, with Indignation moved, 
:At last in Anger swore, he'd rid 
:The bawling Hive of Fraud, and did. 
:The very Moment it departs, 
:And Honesty fills all their Hearts;

This results in a rapid loss of prosperity, though the newly virtuous hive does not mind:

:For many Thousand Bees were lost. 
:Hard'ned with Toils, and Exercise 
:They counted Ease it self a Vice; 
:Which so improved their Temperance; 
:That, to avoid Extravagance, 
:They flew into a hollow Tree, 
:Blest with Content and Honesty.

The poem ends in a famous phrase:

:Bare Virtue can't make Nations live
:In Splendor; they, that would revive
:A Golden Age, must be as free,
:For Acorns, as for Honesty.

==Prosaic expansions==
The poem attracted little attention. The 1714 work, however, quickly achieved notoriety, being understood as an attack on [[Christian virtues]]. What it actually means remains controversial down to the present day. Mandeville did say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What Country soever in the Universe is to be understood by the Bee-Hive represented here, it is evident from what is said of the Laws and Constitution of it, the Glory, Wealth, Power and Industry of its Inhabitants, that it must be a large, rich and warlike Nation, that is happily govern'd by a limited Monarchy. The Satyr therefore to be met with in the following Lines upon the several Professions and Callings, and almost every Degree and Station of People, was not made to injure and point to a particular Persons, but only to shew the Vileness of the Ingredients that all together compose the wholesome Mixture of a well-order'd Society; in order to extol the wonderful Power of Political Wisdom, by the help of which so beautiful a Machine is rais'd from the most contemptible Branches. For the main Design of the Fable, (as it is briefly explain'd in the Moral) is to shew the Impossibility of enjoying all the most elegant Comforts of Life that are to be met with in an industrious, wealthy and powerful Nation, and at the same time be bless'd with all the Virtue and Innocence that can be wish'd for in a Golden Age; from thence to expose the Unreasonableness and Folly of those, that desirous of being an opulent and flourishing People, and wonderfully greedy after all the Benefits they can receive as such, are yet always murmuring at and exclaiming against those Vices and Inconveniences, that from the Beginning of the World to this present Day, have been inseparable from all Kingdoms and States that ever were fam'd for Strength, Riches, and Politeness, at the same time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] commented on ''The Fable of the Bees'' in part one of his ''Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men'' (1754):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mandeville sensed very well that even with all their morality men would never have been anything but monsters if nature had not given them pity in support of reason; but he did not see that from this quality alone flow all the social virtues he wants to question in men. In fact, what are generosity, clemency, humanity, if not pity applied to the weak, to the guilty, to the human species in general?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Economic views==
Mandeville is today generally regarded as a serious economist and philosopher.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/mandevil/#H6 |title=Bernard Mandeville (1670–1733): Influence on Economic Theory |last1=Vandenberg |first1=Phyllis |last2=DeHart |first2=Abigail |publisher=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a second volume of ''The Fable of the Bees'' in 1729,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Mandeville, F. B. Kaye (ed.), ''The Fable of the Bees: Of Private Vices, Publick Benefits, with a Commentary Critical, Historical, and Explanatory'' (1924), Volume One, "Prefatory Note" p ix&lt;/ref&gt; with an extensive set of dialogues that set out his economic views. His ideas about the [[division of labor]] draw on those of [[William Petty]], and are similar to those of [[Adam Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Wealth of Nations'', Glasgow Edition, footnote to p. 27, section I.ii.3&lt;/ref&gt; Mandeville says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When once Men come to be govern’d by written Laws, all the rest comes on a-pace. Now Property, and Safety of Life and Limb, may be secured: This naturally will forward the Love of Peace, and make it spread. No number of Men, when once they enjoy Quiet, and no Man needs to fear his Neighbour, will be long without learning to divide and subdivide their Labour...
Man, as I have hinted before, naturally loves to imitate what he sees others do, which is the reason that savage People all do the same thing: This hinders them from meliorating their Condition, though they are always wishing for it: But if one will wholly apply himself to the making of Bows and Arrows, whilst another provides Food, a third builds Huts, a fourth makes Garments, and a fifth Utensils, they not only become useful to one another, but the Callings and Employments themselves will in the same Number of Years receive much greater Improvements, than if all had been promiscuously follow’d by every one of the Five...
The truth of what you say is in nothing so conspicuous, as it is in Watch-making, which is come to a higher degree of Perfection, than it would have been arrived at yet, if the whole had always remain'd the Employment of one Person; and I am persuaded, that even the Plenty we have of Clocks and Watches, as well as the Exactness and Beauty they may be made of, are chiefly owing to the Division that has been made of that Art into many Branches. (''The Fable of the Bees, Volume two'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology''' are the general and specific scientific theories that explain the ultimate origins of psychological traits in terms of [[evolution]]. These theories originated with [[Charles Darwin]]'s work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern [[evolutionary psychology]], however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that [[natural selection]] has provided humans with many [[psychological adaptation]]s, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in Rubin, Paul H., 2003, ''"Folk economics"'' Southern Economic Journal, 70:1, July 2003, 157-171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual selection]] provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively fast reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively slow reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, but he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of self-sacrificing behavior. Group selection is a weak explanation because in any group the less self-sacrificing animals will be more likely to survive and the group will become less self-sacrificing.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a "[[gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation by helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. According to "[[Hamilton's rule]]", a self-sacrificing behavior can evolve if it helps close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories not only help explain the development of altruistic behavior but also account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name = "moralanimal"/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. [[Parental investment]] theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. [[Dual inheritance theory]] posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology|Critics of evolutionary psychology]] have sometimes challenged its theoretical underpinnings, saying that humans never developed powerful social instincts through natural selection and that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychologists are merely just-so-stories.

==General evolutionary theory==
{{Main|Evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology primarily uses the theories of natural selection, sexual selection, and inclusive fitness to explain the evolution of psychological adaptations.

Evolutionary psychology is sometimes seen not simply as a subdiscipline of psychology but as a metatheoretical framework in which ''the entire field of psychology can be examined.''&lt;ref name="Cosmides"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cosmides |first=L |authorlink=Leda Cosmides |author2=Tooby J |authorlink2=John Tooby  |date=1997-01-13 |url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title= Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer |accessdate=2008-02-16 |publisher=Center for Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
Evolutionary psychologists consider Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to be important to an understanding of psychology.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists emphasize that natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations, which are more efficient than general adaptations.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; They point out that natural selection operates slowly, and that adaptations are sometimes out of date when the environment changes rapidly.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; In the case of humans, evolutionary psychologists say that much of human nature was shaped during the stone age and may not match the contemporary environment.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|Sexual selection}}
Sexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 2, “Natural Selection,” p 25-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt; Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.&lt;ref name="Gaulin, Steven J. C 2003. p 25-56"/&gt;

===Inclusive fitness===
[[Inclusive fitness]] theory, proposed by [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]], emphasized a "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|gene's-eye]]" view of evolution.  Hamilton noted that what evolution ultimately selects are genes, not groups or species.  From this perspective, individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation not only directly via reproduction, by also indirectly helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce.   General evolutionary theory, in its modern form, ''is'' essentially inclusive fitness theory.

Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how "altruism" evolved. The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via [[group selection]]: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted "altruistically"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits.

Furthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of passing on its "selfish" traits.
Inclusive fitness resolved "the problem of altruism" by demonstrating that altruism can evolve via kin selection as expressed in [[Hamilton's rule]]:
&lt;center&gt;cost &amp;lt; relatedness × benefit&lt;/center&gt;
In other words, altruism can evolve as long as the fitness ''cost'' of the altruistic act on the part of the actor is less than the ''degree of genetic relatedness'' of the recipient times the fitness ''benefit'' to that recipient.
This perspective reflects what is referred to as the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] and demonstrates that group selection is a very weak selective force.

Organisms can evolve physical and mental traits designed specifically to attract mates (e.g., the Peacock's tail) or to compete with members of one's own sex for access to the opposite sex (e.g., antlers).

| [[W.D. Hamilton]] (1964)
| '''''[[Inclusive fitness]] (or "gene's eye view", "kin selection") / Evolution of sexual reproduction'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Selection occurs most robustly at the level of the gene, not the individual, group, or species. Reproductive success can thus be indirect, via shared genes in kin. Being altruistic toward kin can thus have genetic payoffs. (Also see [[Gene-centered view of evolution]])
Also, Hamilton argued that sexual reproduction evolved primarily as a defense against pathogens (bacteria and viruses) to "shuffle genes" to create greater diversity, especially immunological variability, in offspring.

| [[Robert Trivers]] (1972)
| '''''[[Parental Investment]] Theory / Parent - Offspring Conflict / Reproductive Value'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

The two sexes often have conflicting strategies regarding how much to invest in offspring, and how many offspring to have. Parents allocate more resources to their offspring with higher reproductive value (e.g., "mom always liked you best"). Parents and offspring may have conflicting interests (e.g., when to wean, allocation of resources among offspring, etc.)

| '''''Game Theory / [[Evolutionary Game Theory]]'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

Organisms adapt, or respond, to competitors depending on the strategies used by competitors. Strategies are evaluated by the probable payoffs of alternatives. In a population, this typically results in an "evolutionary stable strategy," or "evolutionary stable equilibrium"—strategies that, on average, cannot be bettered by alternative strategies.
| Facultative, or frequency-dependent, adaptations. Examples: [[Chicken (game)#Hawk-Dove|hawks vs. doves]], cooperate vs. defect, fast vs. coy courtship, etc.
|-

| How to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with non-kin in repeated interactions?
| [[Robert Trivers]] (1971)
| '''''"[[Tit for Tat]]" Reciprocity'''''&lt;ref name="moralanimal"/&gt;

A specific game strategy (see above) that has been shown to be optimal in achieving an evolutionary stable equilibrium in situations of repeated social interactions. One plays nice with non-kin if a mutually beneficially reciprocal relationship is maintained across multiple interactions, while cheating is punished.
| Cheater detection, emotions of revenge and guilt, etc.
|-
| Non-kin, large groups governed by rules and laws
| How to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with strangers with whom one may interact only once?
| [[Herbert Gintis]] (2000, 2003) and others
| '''''[[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)#Patterns of reciprocity|Generalized Reciprocity]]'''''

(Also called "strong reciprocity"). One can play nice with non-kin strangers even in single interactions if social rules against cheating are maintained by neutral third parties (e.g., other individuals, governments, institutions, etc.), a majority group members cooperate by generally adhering to social rules, and social interactions create a positive sum game (i.e., a bigger overall "pie" results from group cooperation).

Generalized reciprocity may be a set of adaptations that were designed for small in-group cohesion during times of high intertribal warfare with out-groups.

Today the capacity to be altruistic to in-group strangers may result from a serendipitous generalization (or "mismatch") between ancestral tribal living in small groups and today's large societies that entail many single interactions with strangers. (The dark side of generalized reciprocity may be that these adaptations may also underlie aggression toward out-groups.)

==Middle-level evolutionary theories==
Middle-level evolutionary theories are consistent with general evolutionary theory, but focus on certain domains of functioning (Buss, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. NY: Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific evolutionary psychology hypotheses may be derivative from a mid-level theory (Buss, 2011).   Three very important middle-level evolutionary theories were contributed by [[Robert Trivers]] as well as [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|date=March 1971|doi=10.1086/406755|jstor=2822435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|chapter=Parental investment and sexual selection|editor=Bernard Campbell|title=Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971|pages=136–179|publisher=Aldine Transaction (Chicago)|date=1972|isbn=0-202-02005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=Parent-offspring conflict|volume=14|issue=1|pages=249–264|date=1974|doi=10.1093/icb/14.1.249|publisher=The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|journal=American Zoologist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The theory of '''[[parent-offspring conflict]]''' rests on the fact that even though a parent and his/her offspring are 50% genetically related, they are also 50% genetically different. All things being equal, a parent would want to allocate their resources equally amongst their offspring, while each offspring may want a little more for themselves. Furthermore, an offspring may want a little more resources from the parent than the parent is willing to give. In essence, parent-offspring conflict refers to ''a conflict of adaptive interests'' between parent and offspring. However, if all things are not equal, a parent may engage in discriminative investment towards one sex or the other, depending on the ''parent's'' condition.
*The '''[[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]]''', which proposes that parents will invest more in the sex that gives them the greatest reproductive payoff (grandchildren) with increasing or marginal investment. Females are the heavier parental investors in our species. Because of that, females have a better chance of reproducing at least once in comparison to males, but males in good condition have a better chance of producing high numbers of offspring than do females in good condition. Thus, according to the [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis]], parents in good condition are predicted to favor investment in sons, and parents in poor condition are predicted to favor investment in daughters.
*'''[[r/K selection theory]]''',&lt;ref name="Pianka, E.R 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pianka | first1 = E.R. | authorlink = Eric Pianka | date = 1970 | title = On r and K selection | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 104 | issue = 940| pages = 592–597 | doi = 10.1086/282697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, in [[ecology]], relates to the selection of traits in organisms that allow success in particular environments. [[r-selected]] species, i.e., species in unstable or unpredictable environments, produce many offspring, each of which is unlikely to survive to adulthood. By contrast, [[K-selected]] species, i.e., species in stable or predictable environments, invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a better chance of surviving to adulthood.
*'''[[Life history theory]]''' posits that the schedule and duration of key events in an organism's lifetime are shaped by natural selection to produce the largest possible number of surviving offspring.  For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another. Examples of some major life history characteristics include: age at first reproductive event, reproductive lifespan and aging, and number and size of offspring. Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For example, [[attachment theory]] proposes that caregiver attentiveness in early childhood can determine later [[Attachment in adults|adult attachment style]]. Also, [[Jay Belsky]] and others have found evidence that if the father is absent from the home, girls reach first menstruation earlier and also have more short term sexual relationships as women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. (2011).  Evolutionary Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timeline of the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]]'''. Over 2014, Palestinians suffered the highest number of civilian casualties since the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, according to a United Nations report, given the July–August conflict, and rising tolls in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A spike in Israeli casualties also occurred. 2,256 Palestinians and 85 Israelis died, while 17,125 Palestinians, and 2,639 Israelis suffered injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=760104 'UN says Palestinian death toll highest since 1967,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 26 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/annual_humanitarian_overview_2014_english_final.pdf ''Fragmented Lives: Humanitarian Overview,2014''] [[OCHA]] March 2015:'2014 witnessed the highest civilian death toll since 1967 due to the July–August hostilities in Gaza, and a significant increase in Palestinian fatalities in the West Bank. There was also a marked increase in Israeli casualties, as a result of Gaza hostilities and from tension in East Jerusalem.'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the conflict===
On the evening of 12 June 2014, [[2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers|three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped]] in the West Bank. Israeli leadership has placed the responsibility for their abduction on Hamas. On 30 June, corpses of the teenagers were found. Other commentators, such as Israeli historian, Ilan Pappe, and NBC reporter Ayman Mohyeldin, queried the abduction and murder of the Israeli teenagers as being the real start of the chain of events leading to the major conflict. They saw parallels in the earlier killing of two Palestinian teenagers in the [[Beitunia killings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israelandpalestine.org/tag/ilan-pappe/|title=Israel's incremental genocide in the Gaza ghetto|author=Professor Ilan Pappe|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article39102.htm|title=When Does the 'Cycle of Violence' Start?|author=Aldo Guerrero| publisher=Information Clearing House|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohyeldin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/violence-escalates-in-israel-and-gaza-299841091970|title=All In with Chris Hayes|date=8 July 2014|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy report confirming that live IDF fire had been the cause of death of one of the Palestinian teenagers had become public knowledge the day before the kidnapping of the Israeli teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20140612_autopsy_finds_nadim_nawarah_killed_by_live_ammunition|title=Use of live ammunition confirmed in Nawarah shooting|author=B'Tselem|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase 1: Air strikes===
As the Israeli operation began, and the IDF bombarded targets in the Gaza Strip with artillery and airstrikes, Hamas continued to fire rockets and mortar shells into Israel in response. A [[cease-fire]] proposal was announced by the Egyptian government on 14 July, backed by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas;&lt;ref name="ceasefire_support"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/18/us-palestinians-israel-egypt-hamas-idUSKBN0FN1LY20140718 |title=Egypt's Gaza truce move highlights bid to break Islamists|work=Reuters|date= 18 July 2014| accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Israeli government accepted it and temporarily stopped hostilities on the morning of 15 July, but Hamas rejected it in "its current form", citing the fact Hamas has not been consulted in the formation of the ceasefire and it omitted many of their demands.&lt;ref name="pflp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pflp.ps/english/2014/07/15/pflp-proposal-for-calm-seeks-new-chains-on-the-resistance/ |title=PFLP: Proposal for "calm" seeks new chains on the resistance |publisher=Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine |accessdate=21 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724141904/http://pflp.ps/english/2014/07/15/pflp-proposal-for-calm-seeks-new-chains-on-the-resistance/ |archivedate=24 July 2014 |date=2014-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/07/israel-temporarily-halt-fire-gaza-strip-201471620212427540.html|title=Israel and Hamas to observe brief Gaza truce|publisher=Aljazeera.com|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 16 July, the death toll within Gaza had surpassed 200 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/new-isrannneli-air-strikes-bring-gaza-toll-to-200-medics/article/390129|title=Israel warns 100,000 Gazans to flee as truce efforts resume|publisher=Digitaljournal.com |date=15 July 2014|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase 2: Ground invasion===
On 16 July, Hamas and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] offered the Israeli government a 10-year [[truce]] with ten conditions centred on the lifting of the blockade and the release of prisoners who were released in the [[Gilad Shalit]] prisoner swap and were re-arrested; it was not accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Okbi|first1=Yasser|last2=JPost Staff|last3=Hashavua|first3=Maariv|title=Report: Hamas proposes 10-year cease-fire in return for conditions being met By|url=http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Protective-Edge/What-are-Hamass-conditions-for-a-cease-fire-363011|accessdate=7 August 2014|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=713579|title=Report: Hamas, Islamic Jihad offer 10-year truce|publisher=Ma'an News Agency|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July, a five-hour humanitarian [[ceasefire]], proposed by the UN, took place.

Approximately five and a half hours prior to the ceasefire's effect, 13 armed Hamas fighters emerged from a tunnel on the Israeli side of the Gaza border near kibbutz [[Sufa, Israel|Sufa]].

The [[Battle of Shuja'iyya]], which had begun the previous day, continued as Israeli troops and Hamas fighters continued to battle in Shuja'iyya.

The IDF brought in [[IDF Caterpillar D9|D9 armored bulldozers]] to destroy enemy positions. In one case, a few Hamas fighters were killed when an IDF bulldozer destroyed a tunnel they were in. After particularly heavy fire was laid down on Israeli forces in Shuja'iyya, the IDF launched a massive artillery barrage and series of airstrikes after ordering the infantry into armored personnel carriers, with artillery fire landing within 100 meters of Israeli forces. According to the IDF, 37 Hamas fighters were killed in the bombardment, and all firing ceased afterward.

After the first comments of Netanyahu on August,&lt;ref name="ynetnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4564922,00.html|title=Netanyahu: Hamas was 'hit hard,' won few concessions in ceasefire|work=ynet|date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; opinions differ. Hamas wants to persuade the Gazans that it has won a victory, but others wonder if the costs of the battle were worth it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.612655|title=Hamas trying to sell 'victory' to Gazans|date=27 August 2014|work=Haaretz.com|last1=Hass|first1=Amira}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of the war was economically and socially expensive as the Governor Karnit Flug states that she agrees with an increase the budget deficit for 2015 from 2.5% to 3% provided it stems from one-time requirements for covering the costs of Operation Protective Edge and its results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-flug-lends-support-to-raising-deficit-1000967175 Globes English - Karnit Flug lends support to raising deficit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some will said that the war started after Israel opposed to the unity government of Palestinian Authority with Fatah and Hamas and as result, the negotiations plunged into crisis.&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4512399,00.html|title=Instead of making peace with Israel, Abbas making peace with Hamas|work=ynet|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly, those actions gave a validated to Hamas to kidnapping and kill the three teenage boys, which end, in fact, with an agreement with Hamas about casefire.

Other said that Hamas is a terrorist argumentation that uses the suffer and the pain in Gaza for his own purpose. Netanyahu by himself told, all ready, that Hamas is adamantly opposed to negotiations with Israel,&lt;ref name="ynetnews2" /&gt; and that the reason why so soon, after the sign deal, they were shooting from Gaza towards Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4512606,00.html|title=Netanyahu: Abbas chose Hamas over peace with Israel|work=ynet|date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the fighting ends Hamas warned that this was only an interlude in Hamas' fight against Israel.&lt;ref name="ynet" /&gt;
Therefore, the agreement with Hamas let for nothing, not only Israel had loss money and lives, she also get nothing because Hamas still control in Gaza and become even stronger in Gaza. The head of the Central Committee of Netanyahu's Likud party told "We promised the voters we would be decisive against Hamas, but when we had the chance we hesitated.

Netanyahu's right flank in the government has been sharpening its knives even before the fighting with Hamas began and by the middle of the fighting, Minister Avigdor Lieberman reported to the media that Likud Yisrael Beiteinu dismantles partnership with Likud-Beiteinu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.603492|title=Lieberman ends partnership with Netanyahu, dismantles Likud-Beiteinu|date=7 July 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberman reported that "Israel can't ensure safety of citizens in the South as long as Hamas rules Gaza", in additional he said, "It is impossible and forbidden to trust lowly murderers. Therefore, we are against a cease-fire that allows Hamas to rearm and wage another battle against Israel whenever it finds it comfortable...A real peace process and a strategic breakthrough will only be possible after we succeed in freeing the Middle East and the Palestinians from the threat of Hamas (and no one else will do so in our place)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Liberman-Israel-cant-ensure-the-safety-of-its-citizens-in-the-South-as-long-as-Hamas-rules-Gaza-372499|title=Liberman: Israel can't ensure safety of citizens in the South as long as Hamas rules Gaza|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have sniped at Netanyahu for his handling of the crucial US-Israel relationship, "He shouldn’t have gone into a direct confrontation with the Americans," Israeli Knesset member David Tzur.&lt;ref name="ynetnews3" /&gt;

===Gaza and PA===
The celebration took hold for two days. Two men were killed during the celebration. Abu Obeida, a spokesman for the Hamas military wing, stood over an Israeli flag as he addressed the crowd.
"Gaza achieved victory because it has done what major armies failed to do. It forced the enemy to retreat," he said. "We must know that no voice is louder than the voice of the resistance."
,&lt;ref name="ynetnews1" /&gt; "We are here today to declare the victory of the resistance, the victory of Gaza, with the help of God, and the steadfastness of our people and the noble resistance," Hamas spokesman Sami Abu said in a news conference at Gaza's Shifa Hospital.&lt;ref name="ynet" /&gt; Zuhri also said that their main goal is to liberating Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="ynet" /&gt;

It appears that the unity government of Hamas Fatah is in crisis. There were allegations that Hamas abused Fatah members during Gaza war. They harassed, beaten and in some cases even killed Fatah members. Fatha soucre said, "they are just closed minded, unethical racist people who discriminate against non-Hamas people"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4566940,00.html|title=Hamas accused of abusing Fatah members during Gaza war|work=ynet|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, on 1 September, Abbas told that Mashaal is a lair because Hamas worked to bring down the PA ever since its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Abbas-Hamas-leader-Mashaal-is-a-liar-374113|title=PA chief Abbas: Hamas leader Mashaal is a liar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned, on 18 August Israel arrested 93 Hamas men, which tried to carry out a coup of the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.611175|title=Israel arrested 93 Hamas men in West Bank over terror network targeting PA, Israel|date=18 August 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas was quoted as saying, "Hamas’s goal is to destroy the West Bank and create chaos in order to stage a coup against us. Hamas wants to drive me crazy. Since the kidnapping of [IDF soldier] Gilad Schalit they have been contacting the Americans and Israelis and Europeans and others. They have been doing things behind our backs." He also point out about the murder of the three youths, "When I asked Mashaal [about the murder of the three youths] he replied: ‘I don’t know.’ Then he told me, ‘I neither deny nor confirm.’ Lies and beating around the bush." Abbas pointed out that Saleh Arouri, later confirmed that his movement had been behind the murder of the youths.Mashaal enied the claim. After [[Operation Protective Edge]], support for Hamas rises, 61 percent of Palestinians say they would vote for Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4566784,00.html|title=Poll finds support for Hamas rises after Gaza war|work=ynet|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/1.614481|title=Abbas in sharp message to Hamas: Shape up or Palestinian unity government will fail|date=7 September 2014|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were made first hints for the ending of the unity government. Abbas called in the media that "We won't accept the continuation of the situation with Hamas as it is now and in this shape. There must be one authority and one regime." He also reported that Hamas killed 120 men who defied because the house arrest imposed on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Abbas-hints-PA-close-to-ending-unity-deal-with-Hamas-374626|title=Abbas hints PA close to ending unity agreement with Hamas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, U.S. opposed for Abbas’ diplomatic plan since it is a unilateral Palestinians say,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.614454|title=U.S. raps Abbas' diplomatic plan as 'unilateral,' Palestinians say|date=6 September 2014|work=Haaretz.com|last1=Khoury|first1=Jack|last2=Ravid|first2=Barak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herzog asked Abbas to avoid unilateral moves at the United Nations "that might hamper the chances for an agreement." Herzog added that he supports "real negotiations based on security and the fixing of borders as a first step." Despite this Abbas would be expected to bring the plan for a vote in the [[United Nations General Assembly]] but in any case, the General Assembly resolutions are not binding.

On 7 September, during the speech at Arab League, Abbas interrupted after he mention the revolution made by Hamas in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.elfagr.org/Detail.aspx?nwsId=686239|title=ääÔÑ äÕ ßáãÉ "ÔßÑí" ÃãÇã ÌÇãÚÉ ÇáÏæá ÇáÚÑÈíÉ ÈÚÏ ÞØÚ ßáãÉ "ÃÈæãÇÒä"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;News [[Channel 10 (Israel)|channel 10]], 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Abbas-speech-at-Arab-League-interrupted-journalists-asked-to-leave-374667|title=Abbas speech at Arab League interrupted, journalists asked to leave|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reported that the session was planned to be closed to media. Hamas officials responded to Abbas's allegations by urging him to stop "inciting" against them. The Palestinian Ma’an News Agency reported today that in a speech given to Fatah Party on Sunday, Abbas said that the Egyptian government offer to the PA 618-square mile area of the Sinai adjacent to Gaza. Abbas rejected the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/abbas-rejects-egyptian-offer-to-settle-refugees-in-sinai/|title=Abbas rejects Egyptian offer to settle refugees in Sinai|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;
