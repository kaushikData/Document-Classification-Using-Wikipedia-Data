{{nihongo|'''An'ei'''|安永}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}} after ''[[Meiwa]]'' and before ''[[Tenmei]].'' This period spanned the years November 1772 through  March 1781.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis-Frédéric|Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric]]. (2005). "''An'ei''" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 31|page=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperors were {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Momozono of Japan|Go-Momozono]]''-tennō''|後桃園天皇}} and {{nihongo|[[Emperor Kokaku of Japan|Kōkaku]]''-tennō''|光格天皇}}.

==Change of era==
* '''1772''' {{nihongo|''An'ei gannen''|安永元年}}: The era name was changed to ''An'ei'' (meaning "peaceful eternity") to mark the enthronement of [[Emperor Go-Momozono of Japan|Emperor Go-Momozono]] and in hopes of turning attention from the serial catastrophic devastation from fires and storms in ''Meiwa'' 9. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in the 11th month of ''Meiwa'' 9.

==Events of the ''An'ei'' era==
* '''1775''' (''An'ei 4''): Epidemic diseases spread across the country &amp;ndash; in Edo alone, an estimated 190,000 perished.&lt;ref name="h121"&gt;Hall, John Whitney. (1955). ''Tanuma Okitsugu, 1719-1788: Forerunner of Modern Japan, '' p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1775''' (''An'ei 4''): Swedish physician and botanist [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] arrives at [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] outpost or "factory" in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] bay; and ultimately, his scientific activities will result in the first detailed, descriptive survey of the flora and fauna of the Japanese archipelago.
* '''1778''' (''An'ei 7''): Kyoto suffers a massive flood.&lt;ref name="h121"/&gt;
* '''1778''' (''An'ei 7''): Volcanic island of [[Sakurajima]] erupts one mile away from [[Kagoshima, Kagoshima|Kagoshima]] &amp;ndash; 16,000 dead.&lt;ref name="h121"/&gt;
* '''1779''' (''An'ei 8''): Dutch surgeon and cultural-anthropologist [[Isaac Titsingh]] arrives at [[Dejima]] for the first of three terms as ''[[Opperhoofd]]'' or captain of the VOC station; and ultimately, his seminal research will become a noteworthy step in that process in which the Japanese begin to describe and characterize themselves in their own terms. Titsingh's correspondence with [[William Marsden (orientalist)|William Marsden]], a [[philology|philologist]] colleague in the [[Royal Society]] in London, provides some insight into his personal appreciation of the task at hand. In an 1809 letter, he explains:

{{quote|To form a proper idea of the spirit, the character, and the customs of a Nation, almost unknown in Europe, I deemed it preferable to represent them in their own dress, rather than to enter myself into particular details, always infected by the manner of considering the facts, notwithstanding the utmost endeavors to be guided by truth in the most essential parts. [T]o obtain this end, I applied during my stay in Japan to some friends, reputed as men of learning, and free from all national prejudices. [T]hey procured me such works on various topicks, as enjoy'd with them the highest regard. [H]aving succeeding in this, a literal translation appeared to me more congenial with the purpose, and likely to be more satisfactory to the desire for more distinct notions on a people almost unknown, though fully deserving the attention, since a number of years so profusely lavished on the Chinese.|Isaac Titsingh&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Letter to Marsden dated 3 February 1809 in [[Frank Lequin]], ed. (1990). ''Private Correspondence of Isaac Titsingh'', Vol. I, p. 470, Letter No. 204 (not page number, but letter number &amp;ndash; pagination is continuous across the two volumes); see also ''[[Nihon Ōdai Ichiran]]'' for a congruent excerpt in another 1809 letter from Titsingh to Marsden.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

:''[[Bakufu]]'' policy in this era was designed to marginalize the influence of foreigners in ''An'ei'' Japan; however, an unintended and opposite consequence of ''[[sakoku]]'' was to enhance the value and significance of a very small number of thoughtful observers like Thunberg and Titsingh, whose writings document what each scholar learned or discovered first-hand. Thunberg's and Titsingh's published accounts and their unpublished writings provided a unique and useful perspective for [[Orientalists]] and [[Japanologists]] in the 19th century; and the work of both men continues to be rigorously examined by modern researchers today.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, Timon. (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=BLzQA7cpr7wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Secret+Memoirs+of+the+Shoguns:+Isaac+Titsingh+and+Japan,+1779-1822&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA73,M1  ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779-1822'', p. 73.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4746">'''Andrés Cavo''' (1739, [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] &amp;ndash; 1803, [[Rome]]) was a Jesuit and historian of [[New Spain]]. His ''Historia de México'', completed in exile in Rome, was "the first attempt of a general history of the period of Spanish domination in Mexico" and provided information for future historians of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;J. Benedict Warren, "An Introductory Survey of Secular Writings in the European Tradition on Colonial Middle America, 1503-1818" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, vol. 13. Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, pt. 2.'' Howard F. Cline, volume editor.  Austin: University of Texas Press 1973, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Andrés Cavo was born in [[New Spain]] in 1739 in the thriving city of Guadalajara and educated in a Jesuit colegio there. He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1758 in Tepozotlan and became a priest in 1760. He was involved in the missions to the Indians in [[Nayarit]] in 1764, where he was based in the mission of Santísima Trinidad. In 1767 when the order for the [[expulsion of the Jesuits]] was enforced, he sailed first to Spain and then relocated to Italy, where he spent the rest of his life, never being able to return to New Spain. According to J. Benedict Warren, in the hope of being permitted to return to his native land, he dissociated himself from the Jesuits, but the permission was not granted."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, "An Introductory Survey of Secular Writings in the European Tradition on Colonial Middle America, 1503-1818" p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

At his death in 1803 he left a manuscript of his work ''Historia civil y política de México'' (''Civil and Political History of Mexico''), in Latin and Spanish. [[Carlos María de Bustamante]] found the manuscript in the library of the bishop of Tanagra. Bustamante published it with a large appendix, under the title ''Los tres siglos de México bajo el gobierno español hasta la entrada del Ejécito Trigarante'' (''Three Centuries of Mexico Under the Spanish Government''). The first edition was published in [[Mexico City]] in four volumes in 1836-1838. The first two volumes of Bustamante's edition are Cavo's history from the conquest to 1766, the year before the [[expulsion of the Jesuits]].  Bustamante added two volumes, bringing the history up to 1821, when Mexico achieved its independence.&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Cline, "Selected Nineteenth-Century Mexican Writers on Ethnohistory" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians, vol. 13. Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, pt. 2''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1973, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlos María de Bustamante, ''Los tres siglos de México durante el gobierno español, hasta la entrada del ejército trigarante. Obra escrita en Roma por el P. Andrés Cavo, de la Compañía de Jesús; publicada con notas y suplemento''. 4 vols. Mexico 1836-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavo's work begins in 1521 and ends in 1766, with the end of the government of Viceroy [[Joaquín de Montserrat, marqués de Cruillas]]. Thus it does not cover the expulsion of the Jesuits, which happened the following year. Bustamante's ''Suplemento'' continues the work up to 1821 and adds a number of important documents.

Three later editions were published, in 1852 in Mexico City, in 1870 in [[Xalapa|Jalapa]], and by the [[University of Texas]] in 1949. This latter edition was carefully edited by Ernesto P. Burrus, S.J. and published under the title ''Historia de México''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Cavo, ''Historia de México.'' Paleografiada por el P. Ernesto J. Burrus, S.J., con un prologo del P. Mariano Cuevas, S.J. 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The work is not a history in the usual sense. It is better described as the annals of Mexico City, with particular emphasis on the development of political ideas. The book also contains details of colonial life that are not available in any other source. Cavo shows signs of Mexican (not Spanish colonial) nationality, and for this reason is considered a forerunner of Mexican independence.

The '''Archives and Records Association, Ireland''' ('''ARA, Ireland''') is the principal professional body for [[archivist]]s, [[Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera|archive conservators]] and [[records manager]]s in [[Ireland]] (both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]). It is a semi-autonomous affiliate of the [[Archives and Records Association]] (ARA, UK &amp; Ireland). Both the ARA and ARA, Ireland were formed on 1 June 2010 through the merger of the National Council on Archives and the Association of Chief Archivists in Local Government with the [[Society of Archivists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.org.uk/ |title=The Archives and Records Association &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Archives.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal aims of the ARA, UK &amp; Ireland are: to promote the care and preservation of archives and the better administration of archive repositories; to advance the training of its members; and to encourage relevant research and publication.  It achieves these aims through the work of its Council and its various Committees, Groups and Regions, and through its role as the voice of the three professions.  The Association advises, submits evidence and makes comment on matters of professional concern to people or organisations whose activities affect archives and records.

==Structure==
The ARA, Ireland is one of eleven ARA regions that span the whole of the UK and Ireland, each with its own regional committee. However, it enjoys a considerably greater level of autonomy than the other ten British regions. 

==Membership==
ARA, Ireland has over 170 members, mainly made up of professional archivists, records managers and archive conservators from all the different types of organisations that employ such professionals. Through an affiliate membership scheme, those who work at a [[paraprofessional]] level or who are generally interested in the work of the Association and its members can join. There is also a student membership option for those who are studying for a professional qualification in archives, records management or archive conservation.

==Publications and outreach==
ARA, Ireland produces a newsletter three times a year which is now published electronically. It hosts the [http://www.learnaboutarchives.ie/archivists/web learnaboutarchives] website in order to provide a practical and interesting online information service for the general public (but more especially educators and their students) on archival material and archive services in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnaboutarchives.ie/archivists/web |title=Learn About Archives In Ireland |publisher=Learnaboutarchives.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also maintains [[Twitter]] and [[Flickr]] accounts.

The ARA, UK &amp; Ireland produces a biannual publication entitled the ''Journal of the Society of Archivists'', which covers professional issues for its members; and a monthly newsletter, ''ARC'' (Archives, records Management, Conservation).

==Careers==
In terms of a career in archives, records management or conservation, the ARA accredits externally provided postgraduate programmes, of which there is only one in Ireland, the [http://www.ucd.ie/historyarchives/graduateprogrammes/maprogrammes/schofha_ma_archives/ Masters in Archives and Records Management] at [[University College Dublin]]. The [http://www.archives.org.uk/ ARA website] does have information on careers in archives, records management and conservation and links to postgraduate courses. It has a [http://www.archives.org.uk/resources/ArchivesleafletNEW24-02-06%202.pdf leaflet] explaining the profession, updated last in 2006. In terms of the number of career openings or opportunities for advancement the profession is underdeveloped in Ireland with a very limited number of open positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archives.org.uk/?view=article&amp;id=133&amp;ZItemid=161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The ARA, Ireland conducts a wide range of training events throughout the year for its members. Past events includes [http://www.learnaboutarchives.ie/archivists/web?task=Display&amp;art_id=139 Business Continuity and Disaster Planning], [http://www.learnaboutarchives.ie/archivists/web?task=Display&amp;art_id=139 Disaster Management], Education &amp; Outreach Workshop, [http://www.archives.org.uk/training/digitalpreservationroadshows200910/digitalpreservationroadshowdublin26november2009.html Digital Preservation Roadshow] and the [http://www.iar.ie/ Irish Archive Resource Training Day.]

For Archive Conservation, the Association runs a Certificate in Archive Conservation as an in-service scheme restricted to Association members only. It is also involved in the Professional Accreditation of Conservator-Restorers (PAC-R) scheme. All professional members are encouraged to participate in the Association's Registration Scheme, which acts as a formal process of [[Continuing Professional Development|continued professional development]]. Those who complete the registration scheme are entitled to use the [[post-nominal]]s '''RMARA''' (Registered Member Archives and Records Association).

'''Aridoamerica''' denotes an ecological region spanning [[Mexico]] and the [[Southwest United States]], defined by the presence of the culturally significant [[staple food]]stuff ''[[Phaseolus acutifolius]]'', a drought-resistant bean.&lt;ref name=t419&gt;Pratt and Nabhan 419&lt;/ref&gt;  Its dry, arid climate and geography stand in contrast to the verdant [[Mesoamerica]] of present-day central Mexico into Central America&lt;ref name=c85&gt;Cordell and Fowler 85&lt;/ref&gt; to the south and east, and the higher, milder "island" of [[Oasisamerica]] to the north.  Aridoamerica overlaps with both.&lt;ref name=t419/&gt;

Because of the relatively hard conditions, the [[pre-Columbian]] people in this region developed distinct cultures and subsistence farming patterns. The region has only {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|160|mm|in|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation. The sparse rainfall feeds seasonal [[creek (stream)|creeks]] and waterholes.&lt;ref name="Bye and Linares 273"&gt;Bye and Linares 273&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced by [[Gary Paul Nabhan]] in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nabhan|first1=G.B.|title=Native crop diversity in Aridoamerica: Conservation of regional gene pools|journal=Economic Botany|volume=39|issue=4|pages=387|date=October 1985|url=https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/native-crop-diversity-in-aridoamerica-conservation-of-regional-ge|accessdate=3 July 2017|doi=10.1007/bf02858746}}&lt;/ref&gt; building on prior work by anthropologists [[A.L. Kroeber]] and [[Paul Kirchhoff]] to identify a "true cultural entity" for the desert region.

[[File:ChichimecNations.png|thumb|300px|Distribution of tribes called [[Chichimeca]], ca. 1550]]
The [[Chichimeca]], an umbrella term for several tribes used by the [[Nahua people]], were [[hunter-gatherer]]s in Aridoamerica grasslands. They gathered [[maguey]]s, [[Yucca gigantea|yucca flowers]], [[mesquite]] beans, [[Salvia columbariae|chia seeds]], and [[cacti]], including the paddles of fruits of [[nopal]] cactus. The [[century plant]] (''[[Agave americana]]'') is a particularly important resource in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Bye and Linares 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite dry conditions, Aridoamerica boasts the greatest diversity of wild and domesticated [[tepary beans]] (''[[Phaseolus acutifolius]]'') and is a possible site of their domestication.&lt;ref name=t419/&gt; [[Maize]] cultivation reached Aridoamerica by about 2100 BCE.&lt;ref name=herr&gt;Herr, Sara A. "The Latest Research on the Earliest Farmers." ''Archaeology Southwest'' Vol. 23, No. 1, Winter 2009, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists disagree whether the plant was introduced by [[Uto-Aztecan]] migrants from Mesoamerica or spread either northward or southward from other groups by cultural borrowing.&lt;ref name=herr/&gt;

In [[Baja California]], fishing and hunting provided food, as did harvesting acorns, nopal, [[pine nut]]s, and other native plants.&lt;ref name=baja&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmal|first1=John P.|title=Indigenous Baja|url=http://www.houstonmuseumofculture.org/mexico/baja.html|website=History of Mexico|publisher=Houston Institute for Culture|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, people of Aridoamerica [[coppice]]d willows, that is, tree trunks were cut to a stump to encourage the growth of slender shoots. These willow shoots were woven tightly to produce waterproof, cooking baskets. Fire-heated rocks were plunged into a gruel in the baskets to cook.&lt;ref name="Bye and Linares 273"/&gt;

[[File:Battle of Worringen 1288.PNG|thumb|Illustration showing the [[Battle of Worringen]] of 1288  (KBR mss. IV 684, mid 15th century)]]
The '''''Brabantsche Yeesten''''' (or  '' Gestes de Brabant'') is a rhyming chronicle of some 46,000 verses written in the 14th and 15th centuries in the [[Middle Dutch language]]. It provides a history of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], and the original five volumes were written by 
[[Jan van Boendale]] (c. 1280–c. 1351) of [[Antwerp]]; his text was later extended to seven volumes.

Van Boendale's text was written between around 1318 and around 1350, commissioned for a member of the Antwerp patriciate. It extends to 16,318 verses. Boendale's main sources were the ''Chronica de origine ducum Brabantiae'' of 1294 and ''Spieghel Historiael'' &lt;!--sic, this title from  ''Speculum historiale'' by Vincent de Beauvais--&gt; of [[Jacob van Maerlant]]. Much of the text of the first three books are taken from van Maerlant almost verbatim. The events in book five are from Boendale's own lifetime.

Books six and seven, which extend the scope of the chronicled events to 1440, are anonymous. Book six is dated 1432 and book seven is dated 1440; this latter date is also the approximate age of the oldest extant manuscripts of the text. There are seven extant manuscript copies. Two 15th-century manuscripts are held by the [[Royal Library of Belgium]] in Brussels (mss. IV 684 and IV 685). The text was first edited by [[Jan Frans Willems]] and Jean Henri Bormans beginning in 1839.

The '''cheongsam''' (from [[Cantonese]] {{zh|c=長衫|j={{lang|yue-Latn|coeng4saam1}}}};{{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|ɒ|ŋ|ˈ|s|æ|m|}},&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|cheongsam}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɒ|ŋ|ˈ|s|æ|m}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɒ|ŋ|ˈ|s|ɑː|m}}) is one of the most typical, traditional, and feminine body-hugging dress with distinctive Chinese features. It was also known as '''qípáo''' (from [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] {{zh|c={{linktext|旗袍}}|p={{lang|cmn-Latn|qípáo}}|w={{lang|cmn-Latn|ch'i-p'ao}}}}; {{IPA-cmn|t͡ɕʰǐ pʰɑ̌ʊ̯|IPA|Zh-qípáo.ogg}}), and was the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]'s '''mandarin gown'''. It was popularised by Chinese socialites and upper-class women in the 1920s and 1930s in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110067/chi-pao|title=Qipao (Ch'i-p'ao)|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chinese usage ==
[[Image:Qipao1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Two women wearing cheongsam in a 1930s Shanghai advertisement]]
[[File:Zhou Xuan by C.H.Wong Photo Studio.jpg|200px|thumb|Chinese singer and actress [[Zhou Xuan]] wearing a cheongsam in 1930s in Shanghai]]
The English [[loanword]] ''cheongsam'' comes from ''{{lang|yue-Latn|chèuhngsāam}}'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|長衫}}|l='long shirt/dress'|labels=no}}), the [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] pronunciation of the [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]] term {{lang|wuu-Latn|zansae}}, by which the original tight-fitting form was first known.  The Shanghainese name was somewhat in contrast with usage in Mandarin and other [[varieties of Chinese]], where {{lang|cmn-Latn|chángshān}} (Mandarin) refers to [[Changshan|an exclusively male dress]], and the female version is known as a {{lang|cmn-Latn|qípáo}}.

In [[Hong Kong]], where many Shanghai tailors fled after the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution in China]], the word {{lang|yue-Latn|chèuhngsāam}} may refer to either male or female garments. The word {{lang|yue-Latn|keipo}} ({{lang|cmn-Latn|qípáo}}) is either a more formal term for the female {{lang|yue-Latn|chèuhngsāam}}, or is used for the two-piece cheongsam variant that is popular in China. Traditionally, usage in Western countries mostly followed the original Shanghainese usage and applies the Cantonese-language name ''cheongsam'' to a garment worn by women.

== History ==
[[File:Chinese embroidered silk lady's jacket and pleated skirt, c. 1900, East-West Center.JPG|200px|thumb|A model of the Qing-style Han Chinese dress that Han women wore around the 19th to 20th centuries.

[[File:溥仪和婉容.jpg|thumb| [[Pu Yi]]（the Qing dynasty emperor）and his wife]]
When the [[Manchu people|Manchurians]] ruled [[China]] during the [[Qing dynasty]], they used an administrative division called the [[Eight Banner system]]. Originally only the Manchu households were organised within this system, but over time [[Mongol]]s and [[Han Chinese]] were incorporated. The Manchus, and anyone living under the Eight Banners system, wore different clothing from ordinary civilians. Thus they became known as ''Banner People'' ([[wikt:旗人|旗人]] [[pinyin]]: {{lang|cmn-Latn|qí rén}}). The Manchu clothing that they wore consisted of similar long robes for both men and women. These were called {{lang|cmn-Latn|changpao}} ([[wikt:长袍|長袍]]).

For a period of time, under the dynastic laws after 1636, all [Han Chinese were forced under penalty of death to adopt the Manchu male hairstyle, the [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]], and dress in Manchu ''changpao'' instead of traditional [[Han Chinese clothing]] (剃发易服). However, the order for ordinary non-Banner Han civilians to wear Manchu clothing was lifted, and only those Han who served as officials or scholars were required to wear them. Over time though, some Han civilian men voluntarily adopted [[Changshan]]. By the late Qing, not only officials and scholars, but a great many commoner Han men wore Manchu male attire.&lt;ref name="Rhoads2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward J. M.

For women, Manchu and Han systems of clothing coexisted.&lt;ref name="Yang2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shaorong Yang|title=Traditional Chinese Clothing Costumes, Adornments &amp; Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nx5JDiacrH4C&amp;pg=PA7|year=2004|publisher=Long River Press|language=en|isbn=978-1-59265-019-4|page=7|quote=Men's clothing in the Qing Dyansty consisted for the most part of long silk growns and the so-called "Mandarin" jacket, which perhaps achieved their greatest popularity during the latter Kangxi Period to the Yongzheng Period.

The original ''qipao'' fitted loosely and hung in an A-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zhou |first1=Xibao |title=A history of Ancient Chinese Apparel and Accessories |date=January 2011 |publisher=Central Compilation and Translation Press |location=Beijing |isbn=9787511705037}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covered most of the wearer's body, revealing only the head, hands, and the tips of the toes. The baggy clothing also served to conceal the figure of the wearer regardless of age.

The version seen as the typical ''qipao'' in China today was popularised in [[Shanghai]] from the 1920s to the 1940s. But even today it is recognized that there are two styles of ''qipao'': the Shanghai style, and the lesser known Beijing style. The Beijing style retains elements of the original Manchu robe and tends to form loose A-lines, while the Shanghai style is body-hugging and can encompass many Western elements of design and tailoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miranda |title=The difference between Shanghai-style and Beijing-style qipao (海派和京派旗袍) |website=ThePankou.com |url= https://www.thepankou.com/difference-shanghai-style-beijing-style-qipao/ |access-date=11 July 2018 |publisher=self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|certain=y|date=July 2018|reason=Non-notable commercial vendor of the dresses in question; authorship by anonymized employee or owner.

The ''qipao'' of the 1920s-40s was popularized by the celebrities, socialites and even politicians of the time. Former [[First Lady of the Republic of China|First Lady of China]] [[Oei Hui-lan|Madame Wellington Koo]] was a prominent figure among them.&lt;ref name="Koo &amp; Van Rensselaer Thayer (1943)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koo|first1=Hui-lan Oei|last2=Van Rensselaer Thayer|first2=Mary|title=Hui-lan Koo (Madame Wellington Koo): An Autobiography as Told to Mary Van Rensselaer Thayer|date=1943|publisher=Dial Press|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVQKAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=mADAME+WELLINGTON+KOO&amp;dq=mADAME+WELLINGTON+KOO&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nee Hao Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|title=Madame Wellington-Koo – Voted best dressed Chinese Woman of 1920s by Vogue|url=http://www.neehao.co.uk/2016/01/madame-wellington-koo-voted-best-dressed-chinese-woman-of-1920s-by-vogue/|accessdate=24 February 2018|work=Nee Hao Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voted several times by [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] into its lists of the world's best-dressed women, Madame Wellington Koo was much admired for her adaptations of the traditional Manchu fashion, which she wore with lace trousers and jade necklaces.&lt;ref name="Koo &amp; Van Rensselaer Thayer (1943)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nee Hao Magazine" /&gt; Cheongsam dresses at the time had been decorously slit a few inches up the sides, but Madame Koo slashed hers to the knee, 'with lace pantelettes just visible to the ankle'.&lt;ref name="Nee Hao Magazine" /&gt; Unlike other Asian socialites, Madame Koo also insisted on local Chinese silks, which she thought were of superior quality.&lt;ref name="Koo &amp; Van Rensselaer Thayer (1943)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nee Hao Magazine" /&gt;

People eagerly sought a more modernized style of dress and transformed the old ''qipao'' to suit their tastes. Slender and form fitting with a high cut, it had great differences from the traditional ''qipao''. It was high-class [[courtesans]] and celebrities in the city that would make these redesigned tight fitting ''qipao'' popular at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/14703448.html 旗袍起源与哪个民族?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Shanghainese]], it was first known as {{lang|wuu-Latn|zansae}} for 'long dress', rendered in Mandarin as {{lang|cmn-Latn|chángshān}} and in Cantonese as {{lang|yue-Latn|chèuhngsāam}}; it is the last of these spoken renditions of {{lang|zh|長衫}} that was borrowed into English as "cheongsam".

Like the male ''changpao'' they derive from, cheongsams in the beginning were always worn in conjunction with trousers. However, with the introduction of Western fashion during the [[Nanking decade]], many people replaced these with stockings. The formerly purely utilitarian side slits were repurposed into aesthetic elements to highlight the new fashion, and by the 1940s, trousers had completely fallen out of use with cheongsams. As hosiery in turn declined in later decades, cheongsams nowadays have come to be most commonly worn with bare legs. While this development fixed the cheongsam as a one-piece dress, by contrast, the related Vietnamese {{lang|vi|[[áo dài]]}} retained trousers.

===Controversies on origin===
Usually, people take the cheongsam as adapted from a one-piece dress of Manchu women in the Qing Dynasty. But debates on the origin of the cheongsam have never stopped in academic circles. 
There are mainly three arguments on the origins of the cheongsam:
The first argument says that the cheongsam came directly from the clothing of Banner People when the Manchu ruled China during the Qing dynasty. This argument was prominently represented by Zhou Xibao (周锡保) in his work--''The History of Ancient Chinese Clothing and Ornaments''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=周|first1=锡保|title=中国古代服饰史|date=September 1984|publisher=中国戏剧出版社|location=北京|isbn=9787104003595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second opinion holds that the cheongsam inherited some features of the ''chángpáo'' of Banner People in the Qing dynasty, but the true origin of the cheongsam dates back to a period between the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC-771 BC) and the pre-Qin era, approximately two millennia before the Qing dynasty. According to Yuan Jieying (袁杰英)’s book ''Chinese Cheongsam'', the modern cheongsam shares many similarities with the narrow-cut straight skirt that women wore in the Western Zhou dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=袁|first1=杰英|title=中国旗袍|date=January 2002|publisher=中国纺织出版社|location=北京|isbn=9787506417075}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Chinese Professor Bao Minxin (包铭新) also pointed out in his book ''A Real Record of Modern Chinese Costume'' that the cheongsam originated from the ancient robe in the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD). The robe is a one-piece upper and lower connected long dress which was quite popular among ladies in Han.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=包|first1=铭新|title=近代中国女装实录|date=December 2004|publisher=东华大学出版社|location=上海|isbn=9787810388870}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The third argument was raised by Bian Xiangyang (卞向阳) in his book ''An Analysis on the Origin of Qipao''. Bian thinks that the cheongsam originates from neither the robe nor the ''chángpáo''. It is an adaption of western-style dress during the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China era]] when people were open to the western cultures. In his opinion, the cheongsam was a hybrid of traditional Chinese costumes and western costumes such as the waistcoat and one-piece dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=卞|first1=向阳|title=论旗袍的流行起源|journal=装饰|date=November 2003|issue=11|id=J523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The modernized version is noted for accentuating the figures of women, and as such was popular as a dress for high society.  As Western fashions changed, the basic cheongsam design changed too, introducing high-necked sleeveless dresses, bell-like sleeves, and the black lace frothing at the hem of a ball gown. By the 1940s, cheongsam came in a wide variety of fabrics with an equal variety of accessories.

The 1949 [[Chinese Civil War|Communist Revolution]] curtailed the popularity of the cheongsam and other fashions in Shanghai, but the Shanghainese emigrants and refugees brought the fashion to Hong Kong and Taiwan where it has remained popular. Recently there has been a revival of the Shanghainese cheongsam in Shanghai and elsewhere in [[Mainland China]]; the Shanghainese style functions now mostly as a stylish [[Cocktail dress|party dress]].

===Popularity and women’s liberation===
The Republican period is the golden age of Cheongsam. In exploring reasons behind its prevalence in [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], many scholars relate it to the women’s liberation movements. After the feudal Qing Dynasty was overturned, Chinese feminists called for women's liberation from traditional roles and they led several movements against the Neo-Confucian gender segregation, including a termination of bound feet for women, cutting off long hair which was conventionally symbolized as women's oriental beauty, and encouraging women to wear men’s one-piece clothing, [[Changshan]] or "changpao".

"Changpao" was traditionally taken as men’s patent throughout the long history since Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220) to Qing Dynasty (1616-1911). During that time, Chinese Han female’s clothing gradually developed into two pieces. Women were forbidden to wear robes as men did and instead had to wear tops and bottoms known as "Liang jie yi". After the [[Xinhai Revolution|Xinhai Revolution of 1911]] (which overthrew the Qing dynasty), young Chinese people began to learn western science and cultures in order to seek a way of saving the nation. Also, the opening of several ports and ceding territories of China to western powers imported western civilization abundantly to mainland China. Among all these western thoughts, the idea of gender equality quickly gained its followers, among whom young female students became its prime advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=吴|first1=昊|title=中国妇女服饰与身体革命|date=January 2008|publisher=上海东方出版中心|location=上海|isbn=9787801867735}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early years of Republican period, wearing Cheongsam carried the symbol of promoting gender equality and saving the country. The color of Cheongsam were usually cold and rigid. It symbolized a silent protest, as part of the [[May Fourth Movement]] and the [[New Cultural Movement]].

Since 1930s, Cheongsam was popularized from young female students to all women in China regardless of their ages and social status. More and more female workers and celebrities put on Cheongsam. The style of Cheongsam also varied due to western costume’s influence. It changed from a wide and loose style to a more form fitting and revealing cut, which put more emphasis on women’s body line. The length of Cheongsam was also reduced from ankle reaching to above the knee.[[File:Chinese Cheong-sam of Xi.jpg|thumbnail|A typical Chinese Cheongsam in short style above the knee]]

The design of Cheongsam got various inventions like ruffled collar, bell-like sleeves and black lace frothing. Starting from that, the priority of Cheongsam moved from a political expression to aesthetic and ornamental emphasis.[[File:Chinese Cheongsam of Xi.jpg|thumbnail|This is the original collar design of Chinese Cheongsam Tae mo ito ]]

==Timeline of Chinese dress==

In 1929,  Cheongsam was chosen by the Republic of China to be one of the national dresses. In the 1930s, the fashion prevailed in Shanghai.

Traditionally, Cheongsam is made of silk and embroidered with pearls and other decorations. Cheongsams are close fitting, and draw the outline of the wearer's body. 

From the 1950s to the 1970s, due to the anti-tradition movements in China, especially the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976), the Cheongsam was seen as a feudal dress of the ancient times. It was abandoned as daily clothing, and people who wore Cheongsams were judged as being bourgeois, which was considered a political misbehavior at that time. For example, in 1963, when President Liu Shaoqi visited four neighboring countries in South Asia, first lady Wang Guangmei wore a Cheongsam. She was later declared guilty in the Cultural Revolution for wearing a Cheongsam. 

Since 1980s, with the trend of reevaluation of Chinese traditional culture, people in mainland China started to pay attention to the Cheongsam again. The Cheongsam is gaining popularity in films, beauty pageants, and fashion shows in both China and other countries all over the world. In 1984, the Cheongsam was specified as the formal attire of female diplomatic agents by the People's Republic of China.

== Modern use ==
[[File:Cheongsam at the National Museum of Singapore - 20120406.jpg|thumb|Cheongsam belonging to the wives of past Singaporean political leaders on display in an exhibition entitled ''In the Mood for Cheongsam: Modernity and Singapore Women'' at the [[National Museum of Singapore]] in 2012]]

In the 1950s, [[women in the workforce]] in Hong Kong started to wear more functional cheongsam made of wool, twill, and other materials. Most were tailor fitted and often came with a matching jacket. The dresses were a fusion of Chinese tradition with modern styles. Cheongsam were commonly replaced by more comfortable clothing such as sweaters, jeans, business suits and skirts. Due to its restrictive nature, it is now mainly worn as [[formal wear]] for important occasions. They are sometimes worn by politicians and film artists in Taiwan and Hong Kong. They are shown in some Chinese movies such as in the 1960s film ''[[The World of Suzie Wong (film)|The World of Suzie Wong]]'', where actress [[Nancy Kwan]] made the cheongsam briefly fashionable in western culture. However, they are sometimes used as [[Halloween]] costumes in some Western countries. They are also commonly seen in beauty contests, along with [[swim suits]]. Today, cheongsam are only commonly worn day to day as a uniform by people like restaurant hostesses and serving staff at luxury hotels.
===Lolita===
Some [[Lolita fashion | Lolita]] dresses are styled like a cheongsam. The dresses or jumper skirts are designed after traditional Chinese dresses called ''Qi Lolita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kawacura.com/1964|title=East Meets East?? Japanese Lolita Fashion with a Chinese Twist! {{!}} KawaCura|date=2015-03-05|work=KawaCura|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style appeared due to boom in popularity of Lolita fashion in China, as an equivalent to Wa Lolita, a version of Lolita incorporating elements from the traditional Japanese [[yukata]]. Chinese brands that have produced Qi Lolita dresses include Infanta, FanPlusFriend, Classical Puppets and Chess Story.

===Work wear===
Some airlines in Mainland China and Taiwan, such as [[China Airlines]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Hainan Airlines]], and [[Xiamen Airlines]], have cheongsam uniforms for their women flight attendants and ground workers.  These uniform cheongsams are in a plain color, hemmed just above the knee, with a close-fitting wool suit jacket of the same color as the cheongsam.

===Uniform===
A few primary schools and some secondary schools in Hong Kong, especially older schools established by Christian missionaries, use a plain rimmed sky-blue cotton and/or dark blue velvet (for winter) cheongsam with the metal school badge right under the stand-up collar to be closed with a metal hook and eye as the official uniform for their female students. The schools which use this standard include [[True Light Girls' College]], [[St. Paul's Co-educational College]], [[Heep Yunn School]], [[St. Stephen's Girls' College]], [[Ying Wa Girls' School]], etc. These cheongsam are usually straight, with no waist shaping, and the cheongsam hem must reach mid-thigh. The cheongsam fit closely to the neck, and the stiff collar is hooked closed, despite the tropical humid and hot weather. Although the skirts have short slits, they are too narrow to allow students to walk in long strides. The seams above the slits often split when walking and are repeatedly sewn. Many schools also require underskirts to be worn with the cheongsam. The underskirt is a white cotton full slip, hemmed slightly shorter than the cheongsam, and have slits at the sides like the cheongsam, although the slits are deeper. A white cotton undershirt is often worn underneath the cheongsam. The cheongsam's length, styling, color and sleeve length varies between schools. Many students feel it an ordeal, yet it is a visible manifestation of the strict discipline that is the hallmark of prestigious secondary schools in Hong Kong and many students and their parents like that. In summer wearing this for a school day would be sweaty and unhygienic. Some rebellious students express their dissatisfaction with this tradition by wearing their uniform with the stand-up collar intentionally left unhooked or hemmed above their knees. The Ying Wa and True Light Schools have sent questionnaires to their students about uniform reforms but have not altered their policies.&lt;ref&gt;旗袍维系香港女校百年情. 李气虹 (The qipao keep the affections of Hong Kong girls schools of 100 years by Li Qihong) (2003-05-16). {{cite web |url=http://woman.zaobao.com/pages2/woman190503a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819041729/http://woman.zaobao.com/pages2/woman190503a.html |archivedate=2007-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Madam Lau Kam Lung Secondary School of Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery ended their cheongsam uniform in 1990 after receiving suggestions from its student union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandpacific.com.hk/school/p91.htm Madam Lau Kam Lung Secondary School of Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014170559/http://www.grandpacific.com.hk/school/p91.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weddings===
In Western [[wedding]]s, Chinese brides, or brides marrying into a Chinese family, will often wear cheongsam for a portion of the wedding day. It is common for many brides to have both a traditional white [[wedding dress]] and a cheongsam that they wear during the [[tea ceremony]].

==On the international stage==

===Sport-related===
In the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], the medal bearers wore cheongsam. Similar attire was worn by female members of the Swedish team and of the Spanish team in the opening ceremony, with the national colors.

For the [[2012 Hong Kong Sevens]] tournament, sportswear brand [[Kukri Sports]] teamed up with Hong Kong lifestyle retail store [[Goods of Desire|G.O.D.]] to produce merchandising, which included traditional Chinese jackets and cheongsam-inspired ladies' polo shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=G.O.D. and Kukri Design Collaborate for the Rugby Sevens|url=http://hk.asiatatler.com/luxury-news/g-o-d-and-kukri-design-collaborate-for-the-rugby-sevens|accessdate=19 November 2012|newspaper=Hong Kong Tatler|date=16 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815073156/http://hk.asiatatler.com/luxury-news/g-o-d-and-kukri-design-collaborate-for-the-rugby-sevens#|archive-date=2012-08-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=G.O.D. x Kukri |url=http://www.god.com.hk/culture/posts/2012/mar/g.o.d.-x-kukri.html |work=G.O.D. official website |accessdate=19 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515135057/http://www.god.com.hk/culture/posts/2012/mar/g.o.d.-x-kukri.html |archivedate=15 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kukri and G.O.D. collaborate on HK7s Range!|url=http://www.kukrisports.com/gb-general-news-nw-3246|work=Kukri Sports|accessdate=19 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202142708/http://www.kukrisports.com/gb-general-news-nw-3246|archivedate=2 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy-related===
In contemporary China, the meaning of cheongsam has been revisited again. It now embodies an identity of being ethnic Chinese, and thus is used for important diplomatic occasions. 

Since 2013, [[Peng Liyuan]], the first lady of China, has worn cheongsam several times while on foreign visits with Chinese president Xi Jinping. 

In November 2014, cheongsam was the official attire for the political leaders' wives in the 22nd APEC meeting in Beijing.

=== International fashion ===
With the growth of the Chinese economy, cheongsam has experienced a renewed popularity. Many Western designers have integrated elements of cheongsam in their fashion collections. French designer Pierre Cardin once said that cheongsam was his inspiration for many of his evening dress designs.{{cn|date=May 2016}} 

In many films and movies, cheongsam is used to make a fashion statement and an exotic impression. In the 2011 movie ''[[One Day (2011 film)|One Day]]'', Anne Hathaway wore a set of dark blue cheongsam as evening dress.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Many western stars such as Elizabeth Taylor, Nicole Kidman, Paris Hilton, Emma Watson, and Celine Dion have also made public appearances wearing cheongsam.

'''Prom dress controversy'''

In April 2018, 18-year-old Keziah Daum, a white girl from Utah, posted photos on online of herself wearing a red qipao at a high school prom.  The photograph caused controversy as some accused her of insensitive "cultural appropriation". Twitter user Jeremy Lam wrote, "'My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5674661/High-school-student-blasted-racist-wearing-Chinese-dress-prom.html#ixzz5FVdDQ5h9|title=Is this high schooler's Chinese prom dress racist?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed, he wrote, the dress was worn by Asian women as a symbol of activism and fight against "patriarchal oppression". He also suggested that the dress symbolizes "the extreme barriers marginalized people" have overcome.

"For it to simply be subject to American consumerism and cater to a white audience, is parallel to colonial ideology,' Lam said.

Others found criticism of the white girl in the Chinese dress hypocritical, comparing the wearing of American blue jeans by Asians as parallel, while people in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong opined that Daum's wardrobe choice was an honor, not an insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/asia/chinese-prom-dress.html|title=Teenager’s Prom Dress Stirs Furor in U.S. — but Not in China|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar garments ==
Some peole say that the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] ''[[áo dài]]'' bears some similarity to the cheongsam. In the 18th century, in an attempt to separate his domain from [[Tonkin]] ruled by his rival Trịnh clan and build an independent state, lord [[Nguyễn Phúc Khoát]] forced his subjects to relinquish the traditional cross collared dress in favor of a type of garment similar to qipao. However, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] ''[[áo dài]]'' actually originated from The áo tứ thân.

==Etymology==
The name coconut derives from [[seafarer]]s during the 16th and 17th century for its resemblance to a [[head]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coconut|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/coconut|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=14 December 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Coco' and 'coconut' apparently came from 1521 encounters by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] explorers with [[Pacific islander]]s, with the coconut shell reminding them of a [[ghost]] or [[witch]] in Portuguese folklore called ''[[Coco (folklore)|coco]]'' (also ''côca'').&lt;ref&gt;Losada, Fernando Díez.

The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''nucifera'' is [[Latin]] for "nut-bearing".

In March 1521, a description of the coconut was given by [[Antonio Pigafetta]] writing in Italian and using the words "''cocho''"/"''cochi''", as recorded in his journal after the first European crossing of the Pacific Ocean during the [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] [[circumnavigation]] and meeting the inhabitants of what would become known as [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]].

===Fruit===
[[File:Coconut layers (png version).png|thumb|Layers of a matured coconut]]
The [[endosperm]] is initially in its nuclear phase suspended within the coconut water.&lt;ref name=duke/&gt; As development continues, cellular layers of endosperm deposit along the walls of the coconut, becoming the edible coconut "flesh". [[Botany|Botanically]], the coconut [[fruit]] is a [[drupe]], not a true [[Nut (fruit)|nut]].&lt;ref name=botany/&gt; Like other fruits, it has [[Fruit anatomy|three layers]]: the [[exocarp]], [[mesocarp]], and [[endocarp]]. The exocarp and mesocarp make up the "husk" of the coconuts. Coconuts sold in the shops of nontropical countries often have had the exocarp (outermost layer) removed. The mesocarp is composed of a [[fiber]], called coir, which has many traditional and commercial uses. The shell has three [[germination]] pores ([[Micropyle (botany)|micropyles]]) or "eyes" that are clearly visible on its outside surface once the husk is removed.

A full-sized coconut weighs about {{convert|1.44|kg|abbr=on}}. It takes around 6,000 full-grown coconuts to produce one tonne of [[copra]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourke, R. Michael and Tracy Harwood (Eds.).

===Roots===
Unlike some other plants, the [[palm tree]] has neither a [[tap root]] nor [[root hair]]s, but has a [[fibrous root system]].&lt;ref name="pk"&gt;Thampan, P.K. (1981). ''Handbook on Coconut Palm''. Oxford &amp; IBH Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The coconut palm root system&lt;ref name="agro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/Cocos-coconut.pdf|title=''Cocos nucifera'' (coconut), version 2.1|editor=Elevitch, C.R.|publisher=In: Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry.

Only a few of the roots penetrate deep into the soil for stability. This type of root system is known as fibrous or adventitious, and is a characteristic of grass species. Other types of large trees produce a single downward-growing tap root with a number of feeder roots growing from it.

Coconut palms continue to produce roots from the base of the stem throughout their lives. The number of roots produced depends on the age of the tree and the environment, with more than 3,600 roots possible on a tree that is 60 to 70 years old.

Roots are usually less than about {{convert|75|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} in diameter and uniformly thick from the tree trunk to the root tip.

===Inflorescence===
The palm produces both the female and male [[flower]]s on the same [[inflorescence]]; thus, the palm is [[monoecious]].&lt;ref name="pk"/&gt; Other sources use the term [[polygamomonoecious]].&lt;ref&gt;Willmer, Pat. (2011). ''Pollination and Floral Ecology''. Princeton University Press. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVGi6W8QdO4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 57] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421044142/https://books.google.com/books?id=UVGi6W8QdO4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq= |date=April 21, 2016 }}. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12861-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The female flower is much larger than the male flower. Flowering occurs continuously. Coconut palms are believed to be largely cross-[[pollination|pollinated]], although some{{Which|date=September 2009}} dwarf varieties are self-pollinating.

==Distribution==

===Domestication===
[[File:Coconut farm.jpg|thumb|Coconut plantation in India]]

Coconuts could not reach inland locations without human intervention (to carry seednuts, plant seedlings, etc.) and early germination on the palm (vivipary) was important,&lt;ref name=HCH_2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harries | first1 = H | year = 2012 | title = Germination rate is the significant characteristic determining coconut palm diversity | url = | journal = Annals of Botany | doi = 10.1093/aobpla/pls04}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than increasing the number or size of the edible parts of a fruit that was already large enough. Human cultivation of the coconut selected, not for larger size, but for thinner husks and increased volume of endosperm, the solid "meat" or liquid "water" that provides the fruit its food value. Although these modifications for domestication would reduce the fruit's ability to float, this ability would be irrelevant to a cultivated population.

Among modern ''C. nucifera'', two major types or variants occur: a thick-husked, angular fruit and a thin-husked, spherical fruit with a higher proportion of [[endosperm]] reflect a trend of cultivation in ''C. nucifera''. The first coconuts were of the ''niu kafa'' type, with thick husks to protect the seed, an angular, highly ridged shape to promote buoyancy during ocean dispersal, and a pointed base that allowed fruits to dig into the sand, preventing them from being washed away during [[germination]] on a new island. As early human communities began to harvest coconuts for eating and planting, they (perhaps unintentionally){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} selected for a larger endosperm-to-husk ratio and a broader, spherical base, which rendered the fruit useful as a cup or bowl, thus creating the ''niu vai'' type. The decreased buoyancy and increased fragility of this spherical, thin-husked fruit would not matter for a species that had started to be dispersed by humans and grown in plantations. Harries' adoption of the Polynesian terms ''niu kafa'' and ''niu vai'' has now passed into general scientific discourse, and his hypothesis is generally accepted.&lt;ref name=Lebrun&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lebrun | first1 = P. | last2 = Seguin | first2 = M. | last3 = Grivet | first3 = L. | last4 = Baudouin | first4 = L. | year = 1998 | title = Genetic diversity in coconut (''Cocos nucifera'' L.) revealed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers | doi = 10.1023/a:1018323721803 | journal = Euphytica | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 103–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shukla&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shukla | first1 = A. | last2 = Mehrotra | first2 = R.

It is often stated that coconuts can travel 110 days, or {{convert|3000|mile}}, by sea and still be able to germinate.&lt;ref name=Edmondson&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Edmondson | first1 = C.H. | year = 1941 | title = Viability of coconut seeds after floating in sea | url = | journal = Bernice P. Bishop Museum Occasional Papers | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 293–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure has been questioned based on the extremely small sample size that forms the basis of the paper that makes this claim.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ward | first1 = R. G. | last2 = Brookfield | first2 = M. | year = 1992 | title = Special Paper: the dispersal of the coconut: did it float or was it carried to Panama? | url = | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 19 | issue = 5| pages = 467–480 | doi=10.2307/2845766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thor Heyerdahl]] provides an alternative, and much shorter, estimate based on his first-hand experience crossing the Pacific Ocean on the raft ''[[Kon-Tiki]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt; "The nuts we had in baskets on deck remained edible and capable of germinating the whole way to [[Polynesia]]. But we had laid about half among the special provisions below deck, with the waves washing around them. Every single one of these was ruined by the sea water. And no coconut can float over the sea faster than a [[balsa]] raft moves with the wind behind it."&lt;ref name=Heyerdahl /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also notes that several of the nuts began to germinate by the time they had been ten weeks at sea, precluding an unassisted journey of 100 days or more. However, the coconut variety Heyerdahl chose for his long sea voyage likely was of the large, fleshy, spherical ''niu vai'' type, which Harries observed to have a significantly shorter germination type and worse buoyancy than the uncultivated ''niu kafa'' type.&lt;ref name=Harries /&gt; Therefore, Heyerdahl’s observations cannot be considered conclusive when it comes to determining the independent dispersal ability of the uncultivated coconut.

Drift models based on wind and ocean currents have shown that coconuts could not have drifted across the Pacific unaided.&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; If they were naturally distributed and had been in the Pacific for a thousand years or so, then we would expect the eastern shore of Australia, with its own islands sheltered by the [[Great Barrier Reef]], to have been thick with coconut palms: the currents were directly into, and down along this coast. However, both [[James Cook]] and [[William Bligh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.sl.nsw.gov.au/archive/discover_collections/history_nation/terra_australis/logbook.html|title=William Bligh's Logbook|first=State Library of New South|last=Wales|publisher=|accessdate=October 26, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026084918/http://www2.sl.nsw.gov.au/archive/discover_collections/history_nation/terra_australis/logbook.html|archivedate=October 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (put adrift after the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|''Bounty'' mutiny]]) found no sign of the nuts along this {{convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} stretch when he needed water for his crew. Nor were there coconuts on the east side of the African coast until [[Vasco da Gama]], nor in the Caribbean when first visited by [[Christopher Columbus]]. They were commonly carried by Spanish ships as a source of sweet water.

[[File:Coconut germinating on Black Sand Beach, Island of Hawaii.JPG|thumb|Coconut germinating on [[Punalu'u Beach|Punaluʻu Beach]] on the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaiʻi]].]]

This provides substantial circumstantial evidence that deliberate voyagers were involved in carrying coconuts across the Pacific Ocean (possibly the [[Austronesian peoples]]){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} and that they could not have dispersed worldwide without human agency. More recently, genomic analysis of cultivated coconut (''C. nucifera'' L.) has shed light on the movement. However, [[Genetic admixture|admixture]], the transfer of genetic material, evidently occurred between the two populations.

Given that coconuts are ideally suited for inter-island group ocean dispersal, obviously some natural distribution did take place. However, the locations of the admixture events are limited to [[Madagascar]] and coastal east Africa, and exclude the [[Seychelles]]. This pattern coincides with the known trade routes of Austronesian sailors. Additionally, a genetically distinct subpopulation of coconut on the Pacific coast of Latin America has undergone a genetic bottleneck resulting from a [[founder effect]]; however, its ancestral population is the Pacific coconut. This, together with their use of the South American [[sweet potato]], suggests that Austronesian peoples may have sailed as far east as the Americas.&lt;ref name="coco"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Bee|author2=Luc Baudouin|author3=Kenneth M.

The coconut has spread across much of the tropics, probably aided in many cases by seafaring people. Coconut fruit in the wild are light, buoyant, and highly water resistant. It is claimed that they evolved to disperse significant distances via [[marine current]]s.&lt;ref name=Foale&gt;Foale, Mike. (2003).

Retrieved May 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can also be argued that the placement of the vulnerable eye of the nut (down when floating), and the site of the coir cushion are better positioned to ensure that the water-filled nut does not fracture when dropping on rocky ground, rather than for flotation.

Specimens have been collected from the sea as far north as [[Norway]] (but it is not known where they entered the water).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, John. (1898). ''All about the "coconut palm" (''Cocos nucifera'')'' (2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hawaiian Islands]], the coconut is regarded as a [[Polynesia]]n [[introduced species|introduction]], first brought to the islands by early Polynesian voyagers from their homelands in Oceania.&lt;ref name=Elzabroek/&gt; They have been found in the Caribbean and the Atlantic coasts of Africa and South America for less than 500 years (the Caribbean native inhabitants do not have a dialect term for them, but use the Portuguese name), but evidence of their presence on the Pacific coast of South America antedates [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in the Americas.&lt;ref name=Perera/&gt; They are now almost ubiquitous between 26°&amp;thinsp;N and 26°&amp;thinsp;S except for the interiors of Africa and South America.

==Natural habitat==
[[File:Cocos nucifera crown.jpg|thumb|right|Coconut palm heavy with fruit]]
The coconut palm thrives on sandy soils and is highly tolerant of [[salinity]]. It prefers areas with abundant sunlight and regular rainfall ({{convert|1500|-|2500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} annually), which makes colonizing shorelines of the tropics relatively straightforward.&lt;ref name="sppia"&gt;Chan, Edward and Craig R. Elevitch. (April 2006). [http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/Cocos-coconut.pdf ''Cocos nucifera'' (coconut)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020005217/http://agroforestry.net/tti/Cocos-coconut.pdf |date=October 20, 2013 }} (version 2.1). In C. R. Elevitch (ed.). ''Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry''. Hōlualoa, Hawai‘i: Permanent Agriculture Resources (PAR).&lt;/ref&gt; Coconuts also need high [[humidity]] (at least 70–80%) for optimum growth, which is why they are rarely seen in areas with low humidity. However, they can be found in humid areas with low annual precipitation such as in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], which receives only about {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year, but is consistently warm and humid.

Coconut palms require warm conditions for successful growth, and are intolerant of cold weather. Some seasonal variation is tolerated, with good growth where mean summer temperatures are between {{convert|28|and|37|C|F}}, and survival as long as winter temperatures are above {{convert|4|–|12|C|F}}; they will survive brief drops to {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Severe frost is usually fatal, although they have been known to recover from temperatures of {{convert|-4|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="sppia" /&gt; They may grow but not fruit properly in areas with insufficient warmth, such as [[Bermuda]].

The conditions required for coconut trees to grow without any care are:

* Mean daily temperature above {{convert|12|–|13|C|F}} every day of the year
* Mean annual rainfall above {{convert|1,000|mm|in|abbr=on}}
* No or very little overhead [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]], since even small trees require direct sun

The main limiting factor for most locations which satisfy the rainfall and temperature requirements is canopy growth, except those locations near coastlines, where the sandy soil and salt spray limit the growth of most other trees.

===Diseases===
{{Main article|List of coconut palm diseases}}

Coconuts are susceptible to the [[phytoplasma]] disease, [[lethal yellowing]]. One recently selected [[cultivar]], the [[Maypan coconut palm|'Maypan']], has been bred for resistance to this disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harries|first1=H.C.|last2=Romney|first2=D.H.|year=1974|title=Maypan: an F1 hybrid coconut variety for commercial production in Jamaica|journal=World Crops|volume=26|pages=110-111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellowing diseases affect plantations in Africa, India, Mexico, the Caribbean and the [[Pacific Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/article/future-coconut-threatened-lethal-yellowing-disease/|title=Clarion call for King Coconut|last=Bourdeix|first=Ronald|date=9 December 2016|website=www.atimes.com|publisher=|access-date=14 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213225453/http://www.atimes.com/article/future-coconut-threatened-lethal-yellowing-disease//|archivedate=December 13, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pests===
The coconut palm is damaged by the [[larva]]e of many [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species which feed on it, including the [[African armyworm]] (''Spodoptera exempta'') and ''[[Batrachedra]]'' spp.: ''B. arenosella'', ''B. atriloqua'' (feeds exclusively on ''C. nucifera''), ''B. mathesoni'' (feeds exclusively on ''C. nucifera''), and ''B. nuciferae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yarro|first=J.

''[[Brontispa longissima]]'' (coconut leaf beetle) feeds on young leaves, and damages both [[seedlings]] and mature coconut palms. In 2007, the Philippines imposed a [[quarantine]] in [[Metro Manila]] and 26 provinces to stop the spread of the [[pest (organism)|pest]] and protect the Philippine coconut industry managed by some 3.5&amp;nbsp;million farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/62343/news/regions/report-26-provinces-quarantined-for-coconut-pest |title=Report: 26 provinces quarantined for coconut pest |publisher=GMA News Online |publication-date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=17 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220190900/http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/62343/news/regions/report-26-provinces-quarantined-for-coconut-pest |archivedate=December 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruit may also be damaged by [[eriophyid]] [[coconut mite]]s (''Eriophyes guerreronis''). This mite infests coconut plantations, and is devastating; it can destroy up to 90% of coconut production. The immature seeds are infested and desapped by larvae staying in the portion covered by the [[perianth]] of the immature seed; the seeds then drop off or survive deformed. Spraying with wettable [[sulfur]] 0.4% or with [[Neem]]-based pesticides can give some relief, but is cumbersome and labor-intensive.

In [[Kerala]], [[India]], the main coconut pests are the [[coconut mite]], the [[rhinoceros beetle]], the [[red palm weevil]], and the [[coconut leaf caterpillar]]. Research into countermeasures to these pests has {{As of|2009|lc=on}} yielded no results; researchers from the Kerala Agricultural University and the Central Plantation Crop Research Institute, Kasaragode, continue to work on countermeasures. The Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Kannur under [[Kerala Agricultural University]] has developed an innovative extension approach called the [[compact area group approach]] &lt;!-- (CAGA) --&gt; to combat coconut mites.

Coconut palms are grown in more than 90 countries and territories of the world, with a total production of over 59 million [[tonne]]s in 2016 (table).&lt;ref name=faostat/&gt; Most of the world production is in tropical Asia, with [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[India]] collectively accounting for over 72% of the world total (table).

===Cultivation===
Coconut palms are normally cultivated in hot and wet tropical climates. They need year round warmth and moisture to grow well and fruit. Coconut palms are hard to establish in dry climates, and cannot grow there without frequent irrigation; in drought conditions, the new leaves do not open well, and older leaves may become desiccated; fruit also tends to be shed.&lt;ref name="sppia"/&gt;

The extent of cultivation in the tropics is threatening a number of habitats, such as [[mangrove]]s; an example of such damage to an ecoregion is in the Petenes mangroves of the [[Yucatán region|Yucatán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Petenes_mangroves?topic=49597 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011011735/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Petenes_mangroves?topic=49597 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 11, 2012 |title=Petenes mangroves: types and severity of threats |last=McGinley |first=Mark |last2=Hogan |first2=C Michael |series=The Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=World Wildlife Fund, Washington, DC |publication-date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvesting===
In some parts of the world (Thailand and Malaysia), trained [[Southern pig-tailed macaque|pig-tailed macaques]] are used to harvest coconuts. Thailand has been raising and training pig-tailed macaques to pick coconuts for around 400&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/19/448960760/monkeys-pick-coconuts-in-thailand-are-they-abused-or-working-animalsWhat's Funny About The Business Of Monkeys Picking Coconuts?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230221357/http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/19/448960760/monkeys-pick-coconuts-in-thailand-are-they-abused-or-working-animalsWhat's |date=December 30, 2016 }}, NPR, October 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Training schools for pig-tailed macaques still exist both in southern [[Thailand]] and in the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Kelantan]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, Mireille. (January 27, 1967).

===India===
[[File:Coconut Market.JPG|thumb|Coconuts being sold on a street in India]]
Traditional areas of coconut cultivation in India are the states of [[Kerala]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]], [[Puducherry]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Goa]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]] and, [[Gujarat]] and the islands of [[Lakshadweep]] and [[Andaman and Nicobar]]. As per 2014–15 statistics from Coconut Development Board of Government of India, four southern states combined account for almost 90% of the total production in the country: [[Tamil Nadu]] (33.84%), Karnataka (25.15%), Kerala (23.96%), and Andhra Pradesh (7.16%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coconutboard.gov.in/stat.htm |title=Coconut Cultivation |author1=Coconut Development Board |author2=Government of India. |date=n.d. |accessdate=December 8, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210194230/http://www.coconutboard.gov.in/stat.htm |archivedate=December 10, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states, such as Goa, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal, and those in the northeast ([[Tripura]] and [[Assam]]) account for the remaining productions. Though Kerala has the largest number of coconut trees, in terms of production per hectare, Tamil Nadu leads all other states. In Tamil Nadu, [[Coimbatore]] and [[Tirupur]] regions top the production list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coconutboard.nic.in/cps-tn.htm |title=Coconut Cultivation |author1=Coconut Development Board |author2=Government of India. |date=n.d. |accessdate=December 8, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208153858/http://www.coconutboard.nic.in/cps-tn.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Goa, the coconut tree has been reclassified by the government as a palm (like a [[grass]]), enabling farmers and real estate developers to clear land with fewer restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/20/indian-state-decides-coconut-trees-are-no-longer-trees-but-palms-farming|title=Indian state decides coconut trees are no longer trees but palms|date=20 January 2016|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331034934/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/20/indian-state-decides-coconut-trees-are-no-longer-trees-but-palms-farming|archivedate=March 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, it will no more be considered as a tree and no permission will be required by the forest department before cutting a coconut tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Coconut-tree-loses-tree-status-in-Goa/articleshow/50239580.cms|title=Coconut tree loses tree status in Goa – Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2017-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207152535/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Coconut-tree-loses-tree-status-in-Goa/articleshow/50239580.cms|archivedate=February 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maldives===
The coconut is the national tree of the [[Maldives]] and is considered the most important plant in the country. A coconut tree is also included in the country's [[Coat of arms of the Maldives|national emblem and coat of arms]]. Coconut trees are grown on all the islands. Before modern construction methods were introduced, coconut leaves were used as roofing material for many houses in the islands, while [[coconut timber]] was used to build houses and boats.

===Middle East===
The main coconut-producing area in the Middle East is the [[Dhofar]] region of [[Oman]], but they can be grown all along the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Arabian Sea]], and [[Red Sea]] coasts, because these seas are tropical and provide enough humidity (through seawater evaporation) for coconut trees to grow. The young coconut plants need to be nursed and irrigated with drip pipes until they are old enough (stem bulb development) to be irrigated with [[brackish water]] or seawater alone, after which they can be replanted on the beaches. In particular, the area around [[Salalah]] maintains large coconut plantations similar to those found across the Arabian Sea in [[Kerala]]. The reasons why coconut are cultivated only in [[Yemen]]'s [[Al Mahrah]] and [[Hadramaut]] governorates and in the Sultanate of Oman, but not in other suitable areas in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], may originate from the fact that Oman and Hadramaut had long [[dhow]] trade relations with [[Burma]], Malaysia, Indonesia, East Africa, and [[Zanzibar]], as well as southern India and China. Omani people needed the coir rope from the coconut fiber to stitch together their traditional seagoing [[dhow]] vessels in which nails were never used. The knowhow of coconut cultivation and necessary soil fixation and irrigation may have found its way into Omani, Hadrami and Al-Mahra culture by people who returned from those overseas areas.

[[File:Al hafa corniche.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coconut trees line the beaches and corniches of [[Oman]].]]

The coconut cultivars grown in Oman are generally of the drought-resistant Indian 'West Coast tall' &lt;!-- (WC Tall) --&gt; variety. Unlike the [[UAE]], which grows mostly non-native dwarf or hybrid coconut cultivars imported from Florida for ornamental purposes, the slender, tall Omani coconut cultivars are relatively well-adapted to the Middle East's hot dry seasons, but need longer to reach maturity. The Middle East's hot, dry climate favors the development of [[coconut mite]]s, which cause immature seed dropping and may cause brownish-gray discoloration on the coconut's outer green fiber.

The ancient coconut groves of Dhofar were mentioned by the medieval Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] in his writings, known as ''Al [[Rihla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1354-ibnbattuta.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Ibn Battuta: Travels in Asia and Africa 1325–1354 |author=Halsall, Paul.

Coconut trees also are increasingly grown for decorative purposes along the coasts of the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] with the help of irrigation. The UAE has, however, imposed strict laws on mature coconut tree imports from other countries to reduce the spread of [[pest (organism)|pests]] to other native palm trees, as the mixing of date and coconut trees poses a risk of cross-species palm pests, such as [[rhinoceros beetle]]s and [[red palm weevil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pubhort.org/datepalm/datepalm2/datepalm2_38.pdf |author=Kaakeh, Walid, Fouad El-Ezaby, Mahmoud M. Aboul-Nour, and Ahmed A.

It is spread by host insects, that thrive on heavy turf grasses. Therefore, heavy turf grass environments ([[beach resort]]s and [[golf course]]s) also pose a major threat to local coconut trees. Traditionally, [[dessert banana]] plants and local wild beach flora such as ''[[Scaevola taccada]]'' and ''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae]]'' were used as humidity-supplying green undergrowth for coconut trees, mixed with [[sea almond]] and [[sea hibiscus]]. Due to growing [[sedentary lifestyle]]s and heavy-handed landscaping, a decline in these traditional farming and soil-fixing techniques has occurred.

===United States===
[[File:Painted coconuts for Dia de Muertos.jpg|alt=A red woman's face with a fish on her head and a wolf painted onto coconut husks|thumb|Paintings on coconut shells for [[Day of the Dead]] in the United States]]
In the [[United States]], coconut palms can be grown and reproduced outdoors without irrigation in [[Hawaii]], southern and central [[Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.floridagardener.com/palms/coconutpalm.htm | title=''Cocos nucifera'', Coconut palm | publisher=Florida Gardener | work=FloridaGardener.com | date=12 June 2008 | accessdate=27 July 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020105211/http://www.floridagardener.com/palms/coconutpalm.htm | archivedate=October 20, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the territories of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]].

In [[Florida]], wild populations of coconut palms extend up the East Coast from [[Key West]] to [[Jupiter Inlet]], and up the West Coast from [[Marco Island]] to [[Sarasota]]. Many of the smallest coral islands in the [[Florida Keys]] are known to have abundant coconut palms sprouting from coconuts that have drifted or been deposited by ocean currents. Coconut palms are cultivated north of south Florida to roughly Cocoa Beach on the East Coast and the St/Petersburg on the West Coast.

===Australia===
Coconuts are commonly grown around the northern coast of Australia, and in some warmer parts of [[New South Wales]].

The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that the Cocus nucifera "nut is so well known that the following few notes concerning it will be sufficient. As an article of food the kernel is of
great importance to the inhabitants of the tropics. In the Laccadives it forms the chief food, each person consuming four nuts per day, and the fluid, commonly called milk, which it contains, affords them an agreeable beverage. While young they yield a delicious substance resembling blancmange. Among other products of this palm may be mentioned " toddy," which when fermented is intoxicating ; strong arrack is also distilled from it, besides which it yields vinegar and "jaggery" or sugar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=J. H. Maiden | year=1889 | title=The useful native plants of Australia : Including Tasmania | publisher= Turner and Henderson, Sydney | url=https://primo-slnsw.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=SLNSW_ALMA21105097830002626&amp;context=L&amp;vid=SLNSW&amp;search_scope=EEA&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bermuda===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
Most of the tall mature coconut trees found in [[Bermuda]] were shipped to the island as seedlings on the decks of ships. In more recent years, the importation of coconuts was prohibited; therefore, a large proportion of the younger trees have been propagated from locally grown coconuts.

In the winter, the growth rate of coconut trees declines due to cooler temperatures and people have commonly attributed this to the reduced yield of coconuts in comparison to tropical regions. However, whilst cooler winter temperatures may be a factor in reducing fruit production, the primary reason for the reduced yield is a lack of water. Bermuda's soil is generally very shallow ({{convert|1+1/2|to|3|ft|cm|disp=sqbr}}) and much of a coconut tree's root mass is found in the porous [[limestone]] underneath the soil. Due to the [[porosity]] of the limestone, Bermuda's coconut trees do not generally have a sufficient supply of water with which they are able to support a large number of fruit as rainwater quickly drains down through the limestone layer to the [[water table]] which is far too deep for a coconut's roots to reach. This typically leads to a reduction in fruit yield (sometimes as few as one or two mature fruits), as well as a reduced milk content inside the coconut that often causes the fruit to be infertile.

Conversely, trees growing in close proximity to the sea almost universally yield much more fruit, as they are able to tap directly into the seawater which permeates the limestone in such areas. Not only do these trees produce a significantly higher yield, but also the fruit itself tends to be far more fertile due to the higher milk content. Trees found growing in Bermuda's marshy inland areas enjoy a similar degree of success, as they are also able to tap directly into a constant supply of water.

===Substitutes for cooler climates===
In cooler climates (but not less than [[Hardiness zone|USDA Zone 9]]), a similar palm, the [[queen palm]] (''Syagrus romanzoffiana''), is used in [[landscaping]]. Its fruits are similar to the coconut, but smaller. The queen palm was originally classified in the genus ''Cocos'' along with the coconut, but was later reclassified in ''[[Syagrus (plant)|Syagrus]]''. A recently discovered palm, ''[[Beccariophoenix alfredii]]'' from [[Madagascar]], is nearly identical to the coconut, more so than the queen palm and can also be grown in slightly cooler climates than the coconut palm. Coconuts can only be grown in temperatures above {{convert|18|C|F}} and need a daily temperature above {{convert|22|C|F}} to produce fruit.

==Uses==
[[File:Coconuts for sale, Puthia (01).jpg|thumb|right|Green coconuts]]
The coconut palm is grown throughout the [[tropics]] for decoration, as well as for its many culinary and nonculinary uses; virtually every part of the coconut palm can be used by humans in some manner and has significant economic value. Coconuts' versatility is sometimes noted in its naming. In [[Sanskrit]], it is ''kalpa vriksha'' ("the tree which provides all the necessities of life"). In the [[Malay language]], it is ''pokok seribu guna'' ("the tree of a thousand uses"). In the Philippines, the coconut is commonly called the "[[tree of life]]".&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, Jason. (December 13, 2006). [http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/7280 Coconut fuel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831035256/http://www.theworld.org/?q=node%2F7280 |date=August 31, 2011 }}. ''PRI's The World''. Retrieved April 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- please explain In India there is one saying, Coconut tree says "I can build a whole house, but only one stem of mango tree which is necessary in Ghar Pravesh&lt;ref&gt;Ghar Pravesh&lt;/ref&gt; stops me"--&gt;

===Cooking===
[[File:Drinking coconut.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Coconut water]] drink]]

The various parts of the coconut have a number of culinary uses. The seed provides oil for [[frying]], cooking, and making [[margarine]]. The white, fleshy part of the seed, the coconut meat, is used fresh or dried in cooking, especially in confections and desserts such as [[macaroons]]. [[Desiccated coconut]] or [[coconut milk]] made from it is frequently added to [[curries]] and other savory dishes. Coconut flour has also been developed for use in baking, to combat malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood 1975, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 182] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421001335/https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq= |date=April 21, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Coconut chips have been sold in the tourist regions of Hawaii and the Caribbean. Coconut butter is often used to describe solidified coconut oil, but has also been adopted as a name by certain specialty products made of coconut milk solids or [[purée]]d coconut meat and oil. Dried coconut is also used as the filling for many [[chocolate bars]]. Some dried coconut is purely coconut, but others are manufactured with other ingredients, such as [[sugar]], [[propylene glycol]], [[salt]], and [[sodium metabisulfite]].&lt;ref name="Roehl 1996 p. 115"&gt;{{cite book | last=Roehl | first=E. | title=Whole Food Facts: The Complete Reference Guide | publisher=Inner Traditions/Bear | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-89281-635-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H8lwmA52ltIC&amp;pg=PA115 | access-date=May 27, 2017 | page=115 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171123201830/https://books.google.com/books?id=H8lwmA52ltIC&amp;pg=PA115 | archivedate=November 23, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shredded or flaked coconut is used as a [[Garnish (food)|garnish]] on some foods.&lt;ref name="Roehl 1996 p. 115"/&gt; Some countries in Southeast Asia use special coconut mutant called [[Kopyor coconut]] (Kopyor in Indonesia) or macapuno (in the Philippines) as dessert drinks.

Per 100-gram serving with 354 [[calories]], raw coconut meat supplies a high amount of total [[fat]] (33 grams), especially [[saturated fat]] (89% of total fat), moderate content of [[carbohydrates]] (15 grams), and [[protein]] (3 grams). [[Micronutrients]] in significant content (more than 10% of the [[Daily Value]]) include the [[dietary minerals]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[phosphorus]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]] (table).

====Coconut water====
{{Main article|Coconut water}}
Coconut water serves as a suspension for the [[endosperm]] of the coconut during its nuclear phase of development. Later, the endosperm matures and deposits onto the coconut rind during the cellular phase.&lt;ref name=botany/&gt; It is consumed throughout the humid tropics, and has been introduced into the [[retail market]] as a processed [[sports drink]]. Mature fruits have significantly less liquid than young, immature coconuts, barring spoilage. Coconut water can be fermented to produce [[coconut vinegar]].

Per 100-gram serving, coconut water contains 19 [[calories]] and no significant content of [[essential nutrients]].

====Coconut milk====
{{Main article|Coconut milk}}
{{see also|List of dishes using coconut milk}}

Coconut milk, not to be confused with coconut water, is obtained primarily by extracting juice by pressing the grated coconut white kernel or by passing hot water or milk through grated coconut, which extracts the oil and aromatic compounds. It has a total fat content of 24%, most of which (89%) is [[saturated fat]], with [[lauric acid]] as a major [[fatty acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3663?fg=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;count=&amp;max=35&amp;sort=&amp;qlookup=coconut+milk&amp;offset=&amp;format=Full&amp;new=&amp;measureby=|title=Full Report (All Nutrients): 12117, Nuts, coconut milk, raw (liquid expressed from grated meat and water)|publisher=US Department of Agriculture, National Nutrient Database, version SR-28|date=2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230221407/https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3663?fg=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;count=&amp;max=35&amp;sort=&amp;qlookup=coconut+milk&amp;offset=&amp;format=Full&amp;new=&amp;measureby=|archivedate=December 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When refrigerated and left to set, [[coconut cream]] will rise to the top and separate from the milk. The milk can be used to produce virgin coconut oil by controlled heating and removal of the oil fraction.

A [[protein]]-rich powder can be processed from coconut milk following [[centrifugation]], [[separation process|separation]], and [[spray drying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Appl Biochem Biotechnol|year=2012|volume=167|issue=5|pages=1290–302|doi=10.1007/s12010-012-9632-9|title=Production of coconut protein powder from coconut wet processing waste and its characterization|vauthors=Naik A, Raghavendra SN, Raghavarao KS|pmid=22434355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coconut oil====
{{Main article|Coconut oil}}
Another product of the coconut is [[coconut oil]]. It is commonly used in cooking, especially for frying. It can be used in liquid form as would other [[vegetable oil]]s, or in solid form as would [[butter]] or [[lard]].

====Toddy and nectar====
The sap derived from incising the flower clusters of the coconut is drunk as ''[[neera]]'', also known as toddy or ''tuba'' (Philippines), ''tuak'' (Indonesia and Malaysia) or ''karewe'' (fresh and not fermented, collected twice a day, for breakfast and dinner) in [[Kiribati]]. When left to ferment on its own, it becomes [[palm wine]]. Palm wine is distilled to produce ''[[arrack]]''. In the Philippines, this alcoholic drink is called ''[[Arrack#Coconut arrack|lambanog]]'' or "coconut vodka".&lt;ref name="lambanog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/lambanog.htm|title=Lambanog: A Philippine Drink|author=Porter, Jolene V.|year=2005|publisher=American University|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=April 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222210517/http://www1.american.edu/ted/lambanog.htm|archivedate=February 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sap can be reduced by boiling to create a sweet syrup or candy such as ''te kamamai'' in [[Kiribati]] or ''dhiyaa hakuru'' and ''addu bondi'' in the Maldives. It can be reduced further to yield [[coconut sugar]] also referred to as [[palm sugar]] or [[jaggery]]. A young, well-maintained tree can produce around {{convert|300|l}} of toddy per year, while a 40-year-old tree may yield around {{convert|400|l}}.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood 1975, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 20] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420235931/https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq= |date=April 20, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heart of palm and coconut sprout====

[[Apical meristem|Apical buds]] of adult plants are edible, and are known as "palm cabbage" or [[heart of palm]]. They are considered a rare delicacy, as harvesting the buds kills the palms. Hearts of palm are eaten in salads, sometimes called "millionaire's salad". Newly germinated coconuts contain an edible fluff of marshmallow-like consistency called coconut sprout, produced as the [[endosperm]] nourishes the [[Plant embryogenesis|developing embryo]]. Coconut [[haustorium]], a spongy absorbent tissue formed from the distal portion of embryo during coconut germination, facilitates absorption of nutrients for the growing shoot and root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=28867086|year=2018|author1=Manivannan|first1=A|title=Biochemical and nutritional characterization of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) haustorium|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=238|pages=153–159|last2=Bhardwaj|first2=R|last3=Padmanabhan|first3=S|last4=Suneja|first4=P|last5=Hebbar|first5=K. B|last6=Kanade|first6=S. R|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.10.127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
Coconut is an indispensable ingredient in [[Indonesian cuisine]]. Coconut meat, coconut milk, and coconut water are often used in main courses, desserts, and soups throughout the archipelago. On the island of [[Sumatra]], the famous ''[[rendang]]'', the traditional beef stew from West [[Sumatra]], chunks of beef are cooked in coconut milk along with other spices for hours until thickened. In [[Jakarta]], ''soto babat'' or [[Tripe#Beef tripe|beef tripe]] soup also uses coconut milk. On the island of [[Java]], the sweet and savoury ''tempe bacem'' is made by cooking ''[[tempeh]]'' with coconut water, [[coconut sugar]], and other spices until thickened. ''Klapertart'' is the famous Dutch-influenced dessert from Manado, North [[Sulawesi]], that uses young coconut meat and coconut milk.

In 2010, Indonesia increased its coconut production. It is now the world's largest producer of coconuts. The gross production was 15&amp;nbsp;million tonnes.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;[http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx#ancor FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Ju02KCI?url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx |date=February 9, 2012 }}, FAO&lt;/ref&gt; A sprouting coconut seed is the logo for [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia]], the Indonesian scouting organization. It can be seen on all the scouting paraphernalia that elementary (SMA) school children wear, as well as on the scouting pins and flags.

===Philippines===
[[File:Coconut notches.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Harvesting coconuts in the [[Philippines]] is done by workers who climb the trees using notches cut into the trunk.]]
[[File:Coconut2jf.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right: grated, fresh, mature coconut meat; seed interior; oil, rare two-eyed coconut shell; and more grated meat (Philippines)]]
The [[Philippines]] is the world's second-largest producer of coconuts; the production of coconuts plays an important role in the [[Economy of the Philippines|economy]]. Coconuts in the Philippines are usually used in making main dishes, refreshments, and desserts. Coconut juice is also a popular drink in the country. In the Philippines, particularly [[Cebu]], rice is wrapped in coconut leaves for cooking and subsequent storage; these packets are called ''[[ketupat|puso]]''. Coconut milk, known as ''gata'', and grated coconut flakes are used in the preparation of dishes such as ''[[Taro#(Philippines)|laing]]'', ''[[ginataan]]'', ''[[bibingka]]'', ''[[ube halaya]]'', ''[[pitsi-pitsî]]'', ''[[palitaw]]'' and ''[[buko pie]]''. [[Coconut jam]] is made by mixing [[muscovado]] with coconut milk. Coconut [[Sport (botany)|sport fruit]]s are also harvested. One such variety of coconut is known as ''macapuno''. Its meat is sweetened, cut into strands, and sold in glass jars as coconut strings, sometimes labeled as "gelatinous mutant coconut". Coconut water can be fermented to make a different product—''[[nata de coco]]'' (coconut gel).

===Vietnam===
In [[Vietnam]], coconut is grown abundantly across [[Central Vietnam|central]] and [[southern Vietnam]], and especially in [[Bến Tre Province]], often called the "land of the coconut". It is used to make [[coconut candy]], [[caramel]], and jelly. Coconut juice and coconut milk are used, especially in Vietnam's southern style of cooking, including ''[[kho (cooking technique)|kho]]'', ''[[chè]]'', and curry (''cà ri'').

===India===
[[File:Steamed Goan rice and jaggery cakes.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Patoleo]]'' (sweet [[rice cake]]s steamed in turmeric leaves consisting of a filling of freshly grated coconut and [[coconut sugar]]) prepared in [[Goan Catholic]] style.]]

In southern India, the most common way of cooking vegetables is to add grated coconut and then steam them with spices fried in oil. People from southern India also make [[chutney]], which involves grinding the coconut with salt, chillies, and whole spices. ''[[Uruttu Chammanthi|Uruttu chammanthi]]'' (granulated chutney) is eaten with rice or ''kanji'' (rice [[gruel]]). It is also a main side dish served with ''[[idli]], [[vadai]]'', and ''[[dosai]]''. Coconut ground with spices is mixed in ''[[Sambar (dish)|sambar]]'' and other various lunch dishes for extra taste. Dishes garnished with grated coconut are generally referred to as ''[[poduthol]]'' in [[North Malabar]] and ''thoran'' in [[Kerala]]. ''[[Puttu]]'' is a culinary delicacy of Kerala and [[Tamil Nadu]], in which layers of coconut alternate with layers of powdered rice, all of which fit into a bamboo stalk. ''[[Solkadhi]]'', a drink made from coconut milk and ''[[kokum]]'', is usually consumed after meals. ''Narali paak'' is another sweet dish, created with coconut and sugar. Coconut meat can be eaten as a snack sweetened with [[jaggery]] or [[molasses]]. In [[Karnataka]], sweets are prepared using coconut and dry coconut copra.

===Commercial, industrial, and household use===

====Cultivars====
Coconut has a number of commercial and traditional [[cultivar]]s. They can be sorted mainly into tall cultivars, dwarf cultivars, and hybrid cultivars (hybrids between talls and dwarfs). Some of the dwarf cultivars such as 'Malayan dwarf' have shown some promising resistance to lethal yellowing, while other cultivars such as 'Jamaican tall' are highly affected by the same plant disease. Some cultivars are more drought resistant such as 'West coast tall' (India) while others such as 'Hainan Tall' (China) are more cold tolerant. Other aspects such as seed size, shape and weight, and copra thickness are also important factors in the selection of new cultivars. Some cultivars such as 'Fiji dwarf' form a large bulb at the lower stem and others are cultivated to produce very sweet coconut water with orange-coloured husks ([[king coconut]]) used entirely in fruit stalls for drinking (Sri Lanka, India).

====Coir====
[[File:srilanka coconut fibre.jpg|thumb|upright|Extracting the fiber from the husk (Sri Lanka)]]

[[Coir]] (the fiber from the husk of the coconut) is used in [[rope]]s, [[mat]]s, [[mat|doormats]], [[brush]]es, and sacks, as [[caulking]] for boats, and as stuffing fiber for [[mattress]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood 1975, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420222028/https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&amp;pg=PA22 |date=April 20, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in [[horticulture]] in potting compost, especially in orchid mix.

====Coconut fronds====
[[File:Toys from coconut.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Toys from coconut leaves]]
The stiff midribs of coconut leaves are used for making [[broom]]s in India, Indonesia (''sapu lidi''), Malaysia, the Maldives, and the Philippines (''walis tingting''). The green of the leaves (lamina) is stripped away, leaving the veins (long, thin, woodlike strips) which are tied together to form a broom or brush. A long handle made from some other wood may be inserted into the base of the bundle and used as a two-handed broom. The leaves also provide material for [[basket]]s that can draw well water and for roofing [[thatch]]; they can be woven into mats, cooking [[skewer]]s, and kindling [[arrow]]s as well. Two leaves (especially the younger, yellowish shoots) woven into a tight shell the size of the palm are filled with rice and cooked to make ''ketupat''.&lt;ref&gt;Grimwood 1975, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421165607/https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&amp;pg=PA18 |date=April 21, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dried coconut leaves can be burned to ash, which can be harvested for [[lime (mineral)|lime]]. In India, the woven coconut leaves are used as ''pandals'' (temporary sheds) for marriage functions especially in the states of [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Tamil Nadu]].

====Copra====
{{Main article|Copra|Coconut oil}}
Copra is the dried meat of the seed and after processing produces coconut oil and coconut meal. Coconut oil, aside from being used in cooking as an ingredient and for frying, is used in soaps, cosmetics, hair oil, and massage oil. Coconut oil is also a main ingredient in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic oils]]. In [[Vanuatu]], coconut palms for copra production are generally spaced {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} apart, allowing a tree density of {{convert|100|to|160|/ha|/acre|abbr=off}}.

====Husks and shells====
The husk and shells can be used for fuel and are a source of [[charcoal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coconut Shell Lump Charcoal|url=http://www.supremecarbon.com/coco.htm|publisher=Supreme Carbon Indonesia|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229141916/http://www.supremecarbon.com/coco.htm|archivedate=December 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Activated carbon]] manufactured from coconut shell is considered extremely effective for the removal of impurities. The coconut's obscure origin in foreign lands led to the notion of using cups made from the shell to neutralise poisoned drinks. The cups were frequently engraved and decorated with precious metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/17.190.622ab|title=Hans van Amsterdam: Coconut Cup with Cover (17.190.622ab) – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History – The Metropolitan Museum of Art|work=metmuseum.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015101625/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/17.190.622ab|archivedate=October 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dried half coconut shell with husk can be used to buff floors. It is known as a ''bunot'' in the Philippines and simply a "coconut brush" in [[Jamaica]]. The fresh husk of a brown coconut may serve as a dish sponge or body sponge. A ''[[coco chocolatero]]'' was a cup used to serve small quantities of beverages (such as chocolate drinks) between the 17th and 19th centuries in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela.

In Asia, coconut shells are also used as bowls and in the manufacture of various handicrafts, including buttons carved from dried shell. Coconut buttons are often used for Hawaiian [[aloha shirt]]s. ''Tempurung'', as the shell is called in the Malay language, can be used as a soup bowl and—if fixed with a handle—a ladle. In Thailand, the coconut husk is used as a potting medium to produce healthy forest tree [[sapling]]s. The process of husk extraction from the coir bypasses the retting process, using a custom-built coconut husk extractor designed by [[ASEAN]]–Canada Forest Tree Seed Centre &lt;!-- (ACFTSC) --&gt; in 1986. Fresh husks contain more [[tannin]] than old husks. Tannin produces negative effects on sapling growth.&lt;ref&gt;Somyos Kijkar. "Handbook: Coconut husk as a potting medium". ASEAN-Canada Forest Tree Seed Centre Project 1991, Muak-Lek, Saraburi, Thailand. {{Listed Invalid ISBN|974-361-277-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of South India, the shell and husk are burned for smoke to repel mosquitoes.

Half coconut shells are used in theatre [[Foley sound effects]] work, struck together to create the sound effect of a horse's hoofbeats. Dried half shells are used as the bodies of musical instruments, including the Chinese ''[[yehu]]'' and ''[[banhu]]'', along with the Vietnamese ''[[đàn gáo]]'' and Arabo-Turkic ''[[rebab]]''. In the Philippines, dried half shells are also used as a music instrument in a folk dance called ''[[maglalatik]]''.

In World War II, [[coastwatchers|coastwatcher]] scout [[Biuku Gasa]] was the first of two from the [[Solomon Islands]] to reach the shipwrecked and wounded crew of [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109]] commanded by future U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]. Gasa suggested, for lack of paper, delivering by dugout canoe a message inscribed on a husked coconut shell, reading “Nauru Isl commander / native knows posit / he can pilot / 11 alive need small boat / Kennedy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Owen|title=Remembering PT-109: A carved walking stick evokes ship commander John F.

====Coconut trunk====
[[File:Coconut Palace Court.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coconut Palace]], [[Manila]], Philippines, built entirely out of coconut and local materials]]

Coconut trunks are used for building small bridges and huts; they are preferred for their straightness, strength, and salt resistance. In [[Kerala]], coconut trunks are used for house construction. [[Coconut timber]] comes from the trunk, and is increasingly being used as an ecologically sound substitute for endangered hardwoods. It has applications in furniture and specialized construction, as notably demonstrated in [[Manila]]'s [[Coconut Palace]].

Hawaiians hollowed the trunk to form drums, containers, or small canoes. The "branches" (leaf [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s) are strong and flexible enough to make a [[switch (rod)|switch]]. The use of coconut branches in corporal punishment was revived in the Gilbertese community on Choiseul in the [[Solomon Islands]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Herming, George. (March 6, 2006). [http://www.corpun.com/sbj00603.htm Wagina whips offenders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027160604/http://www.corpun.com/sbj00603.htm |date=October 27, 2006 }}. ''Solomon Star''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roots====
The roots are used as a [[dye]], a [[mouthwash]], and a medicine for [[diarrhea]] and [[dysentery]].&lt;ref name=Grimwood18/&gt; A frayed piece of root can also be used as a [[toothbrush]].

===Religion===
{{see also|Coconut Religion}}
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In the [[Ilocos region]] of the northern Philippines, the [[Ilocano people]] fill two halved coconut shells with ''diket'' (cooked sweet rice), and place ''liningta nga itlog'' (halved boiled egg) on top of it. This ritual, known as ''niniyogan'', is an offering made to the deceased and one's ancestors. This accompanies the ''palagip'' (prayer to the dead).

A coconut ({{lang-sa|narikela}}) is an essential element of [[rituals]] in [[Hindu]] tradition. Often it is decorated with bright metal foils and other symbols of auspiciousness. It is offered during worship to a Hindu god or goddess. [[Narali Purnima]] is celebrated on a [[full moon]] day which usually signifies the end of [[monsoon]] season in India. The word ‘Narali’ is derived from ''naral'' implying ‘coconut’ in [[Marathi people|Marathi]]. Fishermen give an offering of coconut to the sea to celebrate the beginning of a new fishing season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.maharashtratourism.net/festivals/narali-poornima.html | title=Narali Purnima | publisher=Maharashtra Tourism | date=2016 | accessdate=3 August 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715223636/http://www.maharashtratourism.net/festivals/narali-poornima.html | archivedate=July 15, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of their religious affiliations, fishermen of India often offer it to the rivers and seas in the hopes of having bountiful catches. Hindus often initiate the beginning of any new activity by breaking a coconut to ensure the blessings of the gods and successful completion of the activity. The Hindu goddess of well-being and wealth, [[Lakshmi]], is often shown holding a coconut.&lt;ref&gt;Dallapiccola, Anna. ''[[Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend]]''. {{ISBN|0-500-51088-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the foothills of the temple town of [[Palani]], before going to worship [[Murugan]] for the [[Ganesha]], coconuts are broken at a place marked for the purpose. Every day, thousands of coconuts are broken, and some devotees break as many as 108 coconuts at a time as per the prayer. 

In [[Hindu wedding]] ceremonies, a coconut is placed over the opening of a pot, representing a [[womb]]. Coconut flowers are auspicious symbols and are fixtures at [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] weddings and other important occasions. In Kerala, coconut flowers must be present during a marriage ceremony. The flowers are inserted into a barrel of unhusked rice (paddy) and placed within sight of the wedding ceremony. Similarly in [[Sri Lanka]], coconut flowers, standing in brass urns, are placed in prominent positions.

The [[Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club]] of [[New Orleans]] traditionally throws hand-decorated coconuts, the most valuable of Mardi Gras souvenirs, to parade revelers. The "Tramps" began the tradition ''circa'' 1901. In 1987, a "coconut law" was signed by Governor [[Edwin Edwards]] exempting from insurance liability any decorated coconut "handed" from a Zulu float.

The coconut is also used as a target and prize in the traditional British fairground game "coconut shy". The player buys some small balls which he throws as hard as he can at coconuts balanced on sticks. The aim is to knock a coconut off the stand and win it.

It was the main food of adherents of the now discontinued Vietnamese religion [[Coconut Religion|Đạo Dừa]] in [[Bến Tre]].

====Myths and legends====
Some South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Pacific Ocean cultures have [[origin myth]]s in which the coconut plays the main role. In the [[Hainuwele]] myth from [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], a girl emerges from the blossom of a coconut tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001/acref-9780195156690-e-657|title=Hainuwele – Oxford Reference|work=oxfordreference.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928002738/http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195156690.001.0001/acref-9780195156690-e-657|archivedate=September 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Maldivian folklore]], one of the main myths of origin reflects the dependence of the [[Maldivians]] on the coconut tree.&lt;ref name="NIAS Press"&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias|Romero-Frias, Xavier]] (2012) ''Folk tales of the Maldives'', [http://www.niaspress.dk/catalogue2011/Catalogue_2012.pdf NIAS Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528131620/http://www.niaspress.dk/catalogue2011/Catalogue_2012.pdf |date=May 28, 2013 }}, {{ISBN|978-87-7694-104-8}}, {{ISBN|978-87-7694-105-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Death by coconuts|an urban legend]], more deaths are caused by falling coconuts than by sharks annually.

===Other uses===
[[File:Srilanka coconut rug.jpg|thumb|Making a rug from coconut fiber]]
The leftover fiber from coconut oil and coconut milk production, coconut meal, is used as livestock feed. The dried [[calyx (botany)|calyx]] is used as fuel in wood-fired [[stove]]s. Coconut water is traditionally used as a growth supplement in [[plant tissue culture]] and [[micropropagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yong | first1 = JW. Ge L. Ng YF.

A coconut can be hollowed out and used as a home for a rodent or small birds. Halved, drained coconuts can also be hung up as bird feeders, and after the flesh has gone, can be filled with fat in winter to attract [[tit (bird)|tits]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2012">A '''corpus language''' is a language without living speakers, while a number of the actual productions of the native speakers have been preserved in some way (usually in written records).&lt;ref&gt;Langslow, D.R. 2002 "Approaching bilingualism in corpus languages" in James Noel Adams, Mark Janse, Simon Swain (edd.) ''Bilingualism in Ancient Society: Language Contact and the Written Text'' Oxford: OUP&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of corpus languages are [[Ancient Greek]], [[Latin]], the [[Egyptian Language]], [[Old English]] and [[Elamite language|Elamite]]. 

Some corpus language left a very large corpus, like [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]], and therefore can be totally reconstucted, even though some details of the pronunciation may be unclear. Such languages can be used even today, as is the case with [[Sanskrit]] and Latin. Others have such a limited corpus that some important words, e.g. some pronouns, are not found in the corpus. Examples for this are [[Ugaritic]] and [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. Languages that are only attested by a few words, often names, and a few phrases (called ''Trümmersprachen'' in German linguistics, literally "rubble languages") can only be reconstructed in a very limited way and often their [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] to other languages remains unclear. Examples are the [[Lombardic language]] and [[Dadanitic]], a [[Semitic language]] that is may be close to [[classical Arabic]].

Corpus languages are studied using the methods of [[corpus linguistics]], but corpus linguistics can be used (and is commonly used) for the study of the recorded productions of living languages.

Not all [[extinct language]]s are "corpus languages," since many languages have disappeared leaving no, or very inadequate, recorded production of their speakers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10458">An '''edict of toleration''' is a declaration, made by a government or ruler and states, that members of a given [[religion]] will not be persecuted for engaging in their religious practices and traditions. The edict implies tacit acceptance of the religion rather than its endorsement by the ruling power.

== Edicts of toleration in history ==

===Ancient times===
*539 B.C. – The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], a clay document issued by Achaemenid [[Persia]]n monarch [[Cyrus the Great]] declaring the restoration of the cult of [[Marduk]] in [[Babylon]] and the restorations of the temples of many peoples, including the [[Jews]].
*311 A.D. – The [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] was issued in 311 by the Roman Tetrarchy of Galerius, Constantine and Licinius, officially ending the [[Diocletian]] persecution of Christianity.
*313 – Roman Emperors [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] that legalized Christianity across the whole [[Imperium Romanum|Empire]].
*361 or 362 - Julian the Apostate, Roman emperor, issued a new edict[[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion]] that legalized/ recognized all forms of Christianity, as well as Judaism and Paganism, across his empire.

===Middle Ages===
*1436 – The [[Compacts of Basel]] (valid for the [[Crown of Bohemia]], previously declared in 1420 and approved by the [[Council of Basle]] in 1433) were formally accepted by Catholics and Utraquists (moderate [[Hussites]]) at an assembly in Jihlava and agreed by King and Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], introducing a limited toleration and stating that "the word of God is to be freely and truthfully preached by the priests of the Lord, and by worthy deacons"

===Early modern period===
*1562 – The [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] was an edict of limited toleration issued by [[Catherine de' Medici]] (the [[regent]] for the young [[Charles IX of France]]) that ended insistent persecution of non-Catholics (mostly [[Huguenots]]).  The persecution was a result of the [[Concordat of Bologna]] (1516). A massacre of Huguenots a few weeks later began open hostilities in the French [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] (1562-1598).
*1568 – The [[Edict of Torda]] (or Turda), also known as the Patent of Toleration (Act of Religious Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience), was an attempt by King [[John II Sigismund Zápolya|John II Sigismund]] of [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Hungary]] to guarantee religious freedom in his realm. Specifically, it broadened previous grants (to Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists) to include the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarian Church]], and allowed toleration (not legal guarantees) for other faiths.
* 1573 – The [[Warsaw Confederation]] made all Christian confessions equal in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
* 1579 – The [[Union of Utrecht]] included a decree of toleration allowing personal freedom of religion. An additional declaration allowed provinces and cities that wished to remain Catholic to join the Union.
* 1598 – The [[Edict of Nantes]], issued by the [[King of France]], [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was the formal religious settlement which ended the first era of the French Wars of Religion. The Edict granted to French [[Huguenots]] legal recognition as well as limited religious freedoms, including: freedom of public worship, the right of assembly, rights of admission to public offices and universities, and permission to maintain fortified towns. The Edict of Nantes, however, would be revoked in 1685 by Henry IV's grandson, [[Louis XIV]], who once again proclaimed Protestantism to be illegal in France through the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]].
* 1609 – The [[Letter of Majesty]] by King of Bohemia and Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], valid for the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Duchies of Silesia]], introducing freedom of religion and religious toleration for all (including non-privileged classes, i.e. peasants etc.)
* 21 April 1649 – [[Maryland Toleration Act]] in the early American colony [[Province of Maryland]], also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was passed by Maryland's colonial assembly mandating religious tolerance for Catholicism. It was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the [[British North American colonies]] and created the first legal limitations on [[hate speech]] in the world. The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for [[English Catholics]], sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant [[Anglicanism]] of Britain and her colonies. The Act was revoked in 1654, before being reinstated again, and finally, repealed permanently in 1692 following the [[Glorious Revolution]]. The Maryland Toleration Act influenced related laws in other colonies and was an important predecessor to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which enshrined religious freedom in American law over a century later.
*16 September 1664 – Edict of Toleration in the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] (now in [[Germany]]), tolerance of the Protestant denominations with each other
*29 October 1685 – [[Edict of Potsdam]], for reform of Huguenots in Lutheran [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian Kingdom]]
*1689 – [[Parliament]] in [[England]] passes the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] protecting [[Protestants]] with [[Roman Catholics]] intentionally excluded
* 1692 – The [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] issued the [[Chinese Rites controversy#Reception in China|Chinese Edict of Toleration]] on 22 March,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Expressionism''' is a [[Modernism|modernist]] [[Art movement|movement]] in [[drama]] and [[theatre]] that developed in Europe (principally Germany) in the early decades of the [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th century]] and later in the [[Theater of the United States|United States]]. It forms part of the broader movement of [[Expressionism]] in [[the arts]].

==History==
There was a concentrated Expressionist movement in early 20th century [[Germany|German]] [[theatre]] of which [[Georg Kaiser]] and [[Ernst Toller]] were the most famous [[playwrights]]. Other notable Expressionist [[dramatists]] included [[Reinhard Sorge]], [[Walter Hasenclever]], [[Hans Henny Jahnn]], and [[Arnolt Bronnen]]. They looked back to Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] and German actor and dramatist [[Frank Wedekind]] as precursors of their [[dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] experiments.

[[Oskar Kokoschka]]'s ''[[Murderer, the Hope of Women]]'' was the first fully Expressionist work for the theatre, which opened on 4 July 1909 in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus (2005, 55-57).&lt;/ref&gt; In it, an unnamed man and woman struggle for dominance. The Man brands the woman; she stabs and imprisons him. He frees himself and she falls dead at his touch. As the play ends, he slaughters all around him (in the words of the text) "like mosquitoes." The extreme simplification of characters to mythic [[archetype|types]], choral effects, declamatory dialogue and heightened intensity would become characteristic of later Expressionist plays. The first full-length Expressionist play was ''[[The Son (play)|The Son]]'' by [[Walter Hasenclever]], which was published in 1914 and first performed in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Rorrison (1998, 475) and Schürer (1997b, ix, xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Expressionism enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the [[Theater of the United States|theatre of the United States]], including plays by [[Eugene O'Neill]] (''[[The Hairy Ape]]'', ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'' and ''[[The Great God Brown]]''), [[Sophie Treadwell]] (''[[Machinal]]''), [[Lajos Egri]] ([[Rapid Transit (play)|''Rapid Transit'']]) and [[Elmer Rice]] (''[[The Adding Machine]]'').

==Style==
Expressionist plays often dramatize the [[religious experience|spiritual awakening]] and sufferings of their protagonists and are referred to as ''Stationendramen'' (station dramas), modeled on the episodic presentation of the suffering and death of Jesus in the [[Stations of the Cross]]. August Strindberg had pioneered this form with his autobiographical trilogy ''[[To Damascus]]'' (1898-1904). Early expressionism in particular testified to the failure of social values&lt;ref&gt;Styan, J.L., (1981) “Expressionism and Epic Theatre”: Modern Drama in Theory and Practice, vol. 3,  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a predilection for ecstasy and despair and hence a tendency towards the inflated and the grotesque; a mystical, even religious element with frequent apocalyptic overtones; an urgent sense of the here and now.&lt;ref&gt;Furness, R.S., (1973) Expressionism (Critical Idiom), London: Methuen Young Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays often dramatise the struggle against bourgeois values and established authority{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}, often [[Personification|personified]] in the figure of the Father. In [[Reinhard Sorge]]'s ''[[The Beggar (Sorge)|The Beggar]]'' (''Der Bettler''), the young hero's mentally ill father raves about the prospect of mining the riches of Mars and is eventually poisoned by his son. In [[Arnolt Bronnen]]'s ''[[Parricide (play)|Parricide]]'' (''Vatermord''), the son stabs his tyrannical father to death, only to have to fend off the frenzied sexual overtures of his mother. In Expressionist drama, the speech is heightened, whether expansive and rhapsodic, or clipped and telegraphic. Director [[Leopold Jessner]] became famous for his Expressionistic productions, often unfolding on stark, steeply raked flights of stairs (an idea originally developed by [[Edward Gordon Craig]]), which quickly became his trademark.

'''Fedor Grigoryevich Solntsev''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Фёдор Григорьевич Солнцев}}) (14 April 1801&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1892)&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt; was a Russian painter and historian of art. His artwork was a major contribution in recording and preserving medieval Russian culture, which was a common subject of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Russian Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOoVAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 September 2013|year=2007|publisher=Rich Frontier Publishing Company|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the main author of the fundamental work ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Antiquities of the Russian State|ru|3=Древности Российского государства}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Древности российского государства|year=1849–1865|publisher=Alexander Semen typography|location=Moscow|url=http://www.runiverse.ru/lib/book7622/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Древности Российского государства, изданные по Высочайшему повелению Императора Николая I.|url=http://www.raruss.ru/treasure/page2/750-antiquities-russian-state.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the main decorator of interiors of the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name=kreml&gt;{{cite web|title=Художник, реставратор, археолог Федор Солнцев и его коллекция рисунков "Древности Российского государства"|url=http://www.kreml.ru/ru/press/MuseumPalace/2006/061209/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Blakesley|2006|p=160}} He discovered and restored [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]es of [[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|Saint Sophia's Cathedral]] and [[Cathedral of the Dormition (Pechersk Lavra)|Cathedral of the Dormition]] of [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] in [[Kiev]], and of [[Cathedral of Saint Demetrius]] in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]].&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt;

Fedor Solntsev, together with [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Philaret Drozdov|Philaret]] and [[Archimandrite]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Photius Spassky|ru|3=Фотий (Спасский)}} are considered the founders of modern [[Russian icons|Russian icon painting]] [[Canon law|canon]] synthesizing ancient Russian traditions, post-[[Peter the Great|Petrine]] efforts and modern art discoveries.&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt;

==Biography==
Fedor Solntsev was born in {{Interlanguage link multi|Verkhne-Nikulskoye|ru|3=Верхне-Никульское}} a village near [[Rybinsk]] in the [[Yaroslavl Governorate]]. His parents were [[serf]]s of [[Count]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Alekseyevich Musin-Pushkin|ru|3=Мусин-Пушкин, Иван Алексеевич (1783)}}.{{sfn|Blakesley|2006|p=160}} His father, Grigory Konstantinovich Solntsev, worked as a box-office attendant for the [[Saint Petersburg Imperial troupe|Imperial theaters]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and travelled to the village very infrequently while his mother, Elizaveta Frolovna Solntseva, was a peasant and lived all her life in the village. Fedor spent his early life with his mother and siblings.&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt; After discovering his artistic ability,  his master freed the Solntsev family, which allowed Fedor to enter the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in Saint Petersburg in 1815&lt;ref name=slovo&gt;{{cite web|last=Aksenova|first=G.V.|title=Художник-археолог Федор Солнцев в сотрудничестве со Святейшим Синодом|url=http://www.portal-slovo.ru/art/46750.php|publisher=Slovo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peoples&gt;{{cite web|title=Fedor Solncev|url=http://www.peoples.ru/art/painter/fedor_solncev/|publisher=Bibliographical dictionary peoples.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a pupil of [[Alexei Yegorovich Yegorov|Alexei Yegorov]] and [[Stepan Shchukin]].&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt; Later, Fedor's younger brother, [[Yegor Solntsev]] also graduated from the Imperial Academy of Art and became a notable painter.&lt;ref name=kreml/&gt;

Fedor graduated from the Academy in 1824 receiving a "Lesser Gold Medal" for his painting ''A Peasant Family''.&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt;&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt; In 1827 he received the "Greater Gold Medal" from the Academy for his painting ''[[Render unto Caesar]]''.&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt;&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt; In 1836 he became a member of the Imperial Academy of Arts for his work ''Meeting of Grand Duke [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Sviatoslav]] with [[John I Tzimiskes|John of Tzimiskes]]''.&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt; In 1876 Solntsev was appointed Professor of the Academy.&lt;ref name=rusart&gt;{{cite web|title=Солнцев Федор Григорьевич (1801–1892)|url=http://www.artsait.ru/art/s/solncev/main.htm|work=Русская живопись}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fedor Solntsev's work was supported by the President of Imperial Academy of Arts [[Alexey Olenin]] and Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt;&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt; The Emperor commissioned Solntsev to decorate dinner parties and embellish his private apartments in the Kremlin.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Through his life Solntsev worked on restoration of many [[Moscow Kremlin]] buildings including the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] and [[Kremlin Armoury]]. He painted [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] and other churches in Moscow.&lt;ref name=kreml/&gt;&lt;ref name=kiev/&gt; Solntsev also worked in [[Kiev]] with restoration and describing artefacts of [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]]. He painted the interiors of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Krestovozdvizhenskaya Church|ru|3=Крестовоздвиженская церковь Киево-Печерской лавры}}   there.&lt;ref name=kiev&gt;{{cite web|title=Солнцев Федор Григорьевич|url=http://ru.kplavra.kiev.ua/Solncev_Fedir_Grigorovich_.html|publisher=National Kyiv-Pechersk Historical Preserve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olenin commissioned Solntsev to describe archaeological and historical artifacts of Russian state.&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt;&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt; Solntsev started to work in 1830. He made more than 3000 highly detailed drawing of different artifacts including the record of all the Kremlin's riches. Seven hundreds of those drawings made the core for the six-volume publications titled ''Antiquities of the Russian State''.&lt;ref name=slovo/&gt;&lt;ref name=peoples/&gt; The encyclopedia was published after Olenin's death using the funds provided by Nicholas I.&lt;ref name=kreml/&gt; Solntsev also provided a detailed chronicle of Old Russian style in his book ''Clothing of Russia''.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/arts/design/09russ.html?_r=0 | title=An Image Consultant to a Spinmeister Czar | date=7 March 2007 | last=Goodbody | first=Bridget L. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded the original system of the [[comparative science]] of [[civilization]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Biography ==
Koneczny graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków and began work at the Jagiellonian Library. After Poland regained its independence, he became an assistant [[professor]] in 1919. In June 1920, after he had qualified and received the degree of [[doctor habilitatus]], he became a professor at [[Stefan Batory University]] in [[Wilno]]. After retiring in 1929, he moved back to Kraków.&lt;ref name="Kwart"/&gt;

== Works ==
His interests ranged from purely historical research to the philosophy of history, religion and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kwart"&gt;Biliński P..[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16208880&amp;dopt=Abstract Feliks Karol Koneczny - academic career path] ([http://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/ebm/record/16208880/full_citation/%5BFeliks_Karol_Koneczny___academic_career_path%5D alternate link]), Kwart Hist Nauki Tech. 2005;50(1):95-115. Last accessed on 26 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His pioneering works deal with the [[history of Russia]]. Koneczny authored extensive monographs of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Judaism|Jewish civilization]]s, which he considered to be [[sociocultural evolution|less developed]] than the [[Western culture|Latin civilization]] of [[Catholic]] western Europe. In 1948, after sixty years of research work Koneczny calculated that his written scholarly output encompassed 26 volumes, each of them being 300 to 400 pages long, not to mention more than 300 articles, brochures and reprints.&lt;ref name="Kwart"/&gt; His theory of civilizations might have inspired [[Anton Hilckman]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]] and others.&lt;ref name="Kwart"/&gt;

== Types of civilizations, according to Koneczny ==
Feliks Koneczny divided civilizations into about twenty types, of which seven types still exist. Four are ancient: "[[Brahminism|Brahmin]]," "Jewish," "Chinese," and "[[Turanism|Turanian]]". Three are medieval: "Latin," "Byzantine," and "Arab." The differences between civilizations are based on their attitude to law and ethics.

For example, Koneczny claimed that in the '''Latin''' civilization, ethics is the source of law. If some laws are not ethical, then they are changed. Government is judged on the basis of its adherence to ethics. The law is of dual nature, divided into public and private spheres. Religion is autonomous, independent and separated from the state. Individuality, self-rule and decentralization are highly valued. Knowledge is [[empiricism|empirical]]. 

In the '''Byzantine''' civilization, organized religion is dependent on the state. In this type of civilization all means are justified to achieve political goals. Politicians follow ethics in private life, but in public they are judged by their skills, not by ethics. The legal government has absolute authority and its orders are not doubted. Germany under Bismarck was an example of that type of civilization.

In the '''Turanian''' civilization, the government is the source of law and ethics and stands above the law and ethics. The ruler cannot be doubted. Koneczny considered Russia under the Tsars an example of this type of civilization.

The '''Jewish''' civilization considers the law most important. The law is the source of ethics. The law cannot be changed. However, the same law can be differently interpreted, which leads to ethical relativism. Similarly to the Brahmin or Hindu civilization, it is sacral, with religion playing a central role. According to Koneczny, one of the elements of Jewish civilization is a belief in the superior role of one nation or race. [[Communist state]]s, despite their atheism, are also products of Jewish civilization. 

Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot mix, and any "synthesis" of several civilizations leads to the victory of one over the other, lower moral standards, or to a state of "un-civilization."

Koneczny did not tie civilization type to any particular race or nation. Hence, Poles could represent the Turanian type of civilization (as, according to Koneczny, did [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s Poland) and Germans could represent the Jewish type. Shockingly, in his publication ''Hitleryzm zażydzony'' ('The Judaized Hitlerism') Koneczny claimed that [[Adolf Hitler]] was an example of the Jewish civilization type.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[[Joanna Beata Michlic]], ''Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present'',  U of Nebraska Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8032-3240-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0803232403&amp;id=t6h2pI7o_zQC&amp;pg=RA4-PA179&amp;lpg=RA4-PA179&amp;dq=Feliks+Koneczny&amp;sig=bcrLG8YLlpgBpNnTAY6tx5D0GUk Google Print, p.179]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an ethnic Jew could represent the Latin type of civilization.

Koneczny considered racism something alien to Latin civilization, which he considered the highest type.

According to Koneczny, Europe in his time was a battlefield between three types of civilization: Latin, Turan and Jewish. He argued that Byzantine type of civilization had already lost the battle and was in deep crisis.

'''Ferdinando Ughelli''' (21 March 1595 – 19 May 1670) was an Italian [[Cistercian]] monk and church historian.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Florence]]. He entered the [[Cistercian]] Order and was sent to the [[Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]], where he studied under the [[Jesuits]] [[Francesco Piccolomini (Jesuit)|Francesco Piccolomini]] and [[John de Lugo]].
 
He filled many important posts in his order, being Abbot of [[Badia a Settimo]] near Florence, and, from 1638, Abbot of [[Tre Fontane]] in Rome. He was skilled in ecclesiastical history. To encourage him in this work and to defray the expense of the journeys it entailed, Pope [[Alexander VII]] granted him an annual pension of 500 [[scudi]]. He was a [[consultor]] of the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] and theologian to Cardinal Carlo de' Medici; he was frequently offered the episcopal dignity, which he refused. 

He died in Rome in 1670 and was buried in his [[wikt:abbatial#English|abbatial]] church.

==Literary works==
His chief work is ''Italia sacra sive de episcopis Italae''&lt;ref&gt;"Sacred Italy, or Concerning the Bishops of Italy"&lt;/ref&gt; (9 vols, 1643–1662), re-edited with corrections and additions by Nicola Coleti (1717–1722),&lt;ref&gt;Some volumes are available [http://www.google.pl/search?hl=pl&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;q=editions:r8vzCs-8AwkC online]&lt;/ref&gt; with a tenth volume. In compiling this work, he frequently had to deal with matters not previously treated by historians; as a result, the ''Italia sacra'', owing to the imperfections of historical science in Ughelli's day, especially from the point of view of criticism and diplomatics, contains serious errors, particularly as the author was more intent on collecting than on weighing documents. Nevertheless, his work with all its imperfections was necessary to facilitate the labours of critical historians of a later day, and is consulted even now. In the last volume of the ''Italia sacra'' he published various historical sources until then unedited.

Among his other writings are:
* ''Cardinalium elogia ex sacro ordine cisterciensi'' (1624): writings in praise of [[cardinalate|cardinals]] of his order and the papal privileges granted to it;
* ''Columnensis familiae cardinalium imagines'' (1650): biographies of cardinals of the [[Colonna]] family.
* genealogical works on the Counts of Marsciano (1667) and the Capizucchi (1653);
* ''Aggiunte'' ("additions") to the ''Vitae et res gestae pontificum'' by Ciaconius ([[Alphonsus Ciacconius]]).

'''Franz Maria Feldhaus''' (26 April 1874 in [[Neuss]] – 22 May 1957 in [[Wilhelmshaven]]) was a German engineer, [[historian of science]], and scientific writer.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Erhard Lessing: ''Franz Maria Feldhaus. Kann man von Technikgeschichte leben?''. In: Peter Blum (Hrsg.): Pioniere aus Technik und Wirtschaft in Heidelberg. Shaker, Aachen 2000, {{ISBN|3-8265-6544-4}}, S. 80–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Popplow: ''Franz Maria Feldhaus. Die Weltgeschichte der Technik auf Karteikarten''. In: cut und paste um 1900 (= Kaleidoskopien 2002; H. 4), S. 100–114&lt;/ref&gt; He was known in the late 1950s as "Germany's most well-known and most prolific writer on the history of technology."&lt;ref name="RSH 1961"&gt;R. S. Hartenberg. "[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3101304 Geschichte des Technischen Zeichnens by Franz Maria Feldhaus; Edmund Schruff]." in: ''Technology and Culture'' Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1961), pp. 45-49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Neuss]] as son of a [[pharmacist]], Feldhaus studied [[electrical engineering]] without receiving his degree. Later on the occasion of his 50th birthday in 1924 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[RWTH Aachen]] in recognition of his accomplishments in the field of the history of science. In 1928 he was elected full member of the French "Académie d'Histoire des Sciences."

Late 1890s Feldhaus started to work as [[inventor]] and doing odd jobs, while starting to be interested in the [[history of science]]. In his Mannheim Workshop for Precision Mechanics he described himself as engineer - this term at that time still unprotected. In 1900 he gave up his practical activities and worked henceforth as historian of science and freelance writer.&lt;ref name="NDB"&gt;{{NDB|5|68||Feldhaus, Franz Maria|Redaktion|116439432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feldhaus told [[Willy Ley]] that he began writing books on the history of science because, while unemployed, he read books on the subject at the library and believed that he could write better ones.&lt;ref name="ley196112"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldhaus later attended lectures by Theodor Beck (1839-1917) in Darmstadt, who had published on the history of engineering. After his death in 1917 he inherited his estate and research in the field. Over the years Feldhaus built up without any government support an archive on the history of engineering, which became one of the largest private archives in Germany.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; In Heidelberg and later in Berlin Feldhaus built a private institute, entitled "Quellenforschungen zur Geschichte der Technik und der Naturwissenschaften" (Source research on the history of engineering and natural science) in 1909. He also founded the company Historia-Foto GmbH, which might have been the first commercial image archive in Germany. Immediately after the Second World War in 1945-46 Feldhaus was appointed Director of the National Museum in [[Neustrelitz]]. The last years of his life he lived in Wilhelmshaven.

In 1959 Feldhaus posthumously received the [[Rudolf-Diesel-Medaille]] from the German Institute for Inventions. The poet and novelist [[Eva Zeller]] (born 1923) is one of Feldhaus' daughters.

== Work ==
=== ''Lexikon der Erfindungen und Entdeckungen,'' 1904 ===
Feldhaus' first publication was the ''Lexikon der Erfindungen und Entdeckungen,'' (Dictionary of inventions and discoveries) in 1904, which gave a timeline of inventions and discoveries in the fields of science and technology. This work was designed as reference, and not for educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Feldhaus (1904, p. v)&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Institute for research in the history of engineering, natural science and industry, 1909/19 ===
In 1909 Feldhaus founded the "Quellenforschungen zur Geschichte der Technik und Naturwissenschaften" Institute&lt;ref&gt;Burkhard Dietz (1996). ''Technische Intelligenz und "Kulturfaktor Technik".'' p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 this institute was turned into the [[Gmbh]] "Quellenforschungen zur Geschichte der Technik und Industrie," and since 1927 "Geschichte der Technik, e.V.".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang König (ed.). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-dXoQdkB8OMC&amp;pg=PA50 Die technikhistorische Forschung in Deutschland von 1800 bis zur Gegenwart],'' 2007, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The History of Technical Drawing,'' 1960-63 ===
Feldhaus' "Geschichte des technischen Zeichnens" is translated into English and published in 1960-63 as "The History of Technical Drawing." The work started with the words:

:"From the time man began to think, invent and actively create, he has endeavored to express his thoughts pictorially, both for his own assistance and to make himself understood by others..."&lt;ref&gt;Feldhaus, cited in: American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), ''Proceedings.''  Vol. 68 (1961), p. 724.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1961 review about this work by R. S. Hartenberg in the ''Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education'' commented about this opening line, that 
:"...herein is the essence of graphics. The passing centuries have brought about new concepts and improvement in methods; nevertheless industry's need for the pictorial communicator will remain. Industry will continue looking for graduates equipped with a thorough understanding of graphic principles and with the skill required to execute neat and accurate drawings..."&lt;ref&gt;ASEE 1961, p. 724.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartenberg further explained, that the book primarily intents to give the interested layman a good survey. After an introduction it starts with a section "Earliest Time, Ancient Time and the Middle Ages," which:

:"... roughs out the course of drawing from the ice-age cave-paintings through the graphic arts of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Arabia to west European practice, commenting on media  and tools. Attention is called to a device common to the civilized drawings, viz., that of showing important parts located in different planes swung into a single plane."&lt;ref name="RSH 1961"/&gt;

The section on the ''Technologist's Professions'' (p. 5) amplified, that development of the underlying concepts, as Hartenberg (1961) summarized:
:"... in Homeric Greece, art and technology bore the same name (and stigma? ) instead of being placed in opposition at they are today. With the Romans all things that were built, from cities to engines of war, came under the concept of ''architecture'' (as with [[Vitruvius]]); the practitioners — people of ingenuity and inventiveness — were called ''architecti.''..."&lt;ref name="RSH 1961"/&gt;

And furthermore:
:"...We learn that [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] had an " engineering " school in 228, and that [[Harun al-Rashid]] founded a technical school in [[Baghdad]] in 807. The title of engineer appears in the twelfth century, its use spreading under the urgings of the [[Crusaders]] who needed military engineers to back and encourage their Faith. [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that peculiarly gifted man, received an appointment as engineer, and perhaps set a style, for in later generations many who achieved fame as engineers and inventors came from the non-technical ranks of life..."&lt;ref name="RSH 1961"/&gt;

Educated at [[Edinburgh High School]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]], he became in 1811 a member of the [[Faculty of Advocates]].

He was an ardent [[Whig (British political party)|whig]], and his political creed partly inspired the one work by which he is known, his ''History of the British Empire''. In the Scottish agitation for the first [[Reform Bills|Reform Bill]], Brodie presided at a very numerous gathering of the working-men of Edinburgh held on [[Arthur's Seat]] in November 1831 against the rejection of the bill by the peers. In 1836 he was appointed historiographer of Scotland, with a salary of £180 a year.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Brodie died in London on 22 January 1867.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Brodie's major work was ''History of the British Empire from the accession of Charles the First to the Restoration, with an introduction tracing the progress of society and of the Constitution from the feudal times to the opening of the history, and including a particular examination of Mr. Hume's statements relative to the character of the English government.'' The 'statements' which Brodie undertook to refute were chiefly those in which [[David Hume]] found precedents for the claims of the [[Stuarts]] in the action of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] sovereigns. Brodie's history was by far the most elaborate assault on the Stuarts and their apologists, especially Hume and [[Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]], and the most thoroughgoing vindication of the [[puritans]], that had then appeared. It was not of high historical value. It was reviewed in the '[[Edinburgh Review]]' for March 1824, probably by John Allen of Holland House celebrity (see Lord Jeffrey's letter to him in [[Lord Cockburn]]'s Life of Jeffrey, 2nd ed. 1852, ii. 217). While generally laudatory, the reviewer censured Brodie's indiscriminating partisanship. Guizot has expressed his surprise that so passionate a partisan should have written with so little animation (Preface to the Histoire de la Revolution d'Angleterre, 4th ed. 1860, i. 15). In 1866 appeared a second edition of his History, with the original title slightly expanded into ''A Constitutional History of the British Empire''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Besides the History, Brodie published an edition of Stair's ''Institutes of the Law of Scotland, with commentaries and a supplement as to mercantile law.'' Lord Cockburn says of it and him (Journal, 1874, ii. 113): "His edition of Stair is a deep and difficult legal book. His style is bad, and his method not good.'"&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Brodie was also author of a pamphlet entitled ''Strictures on the Appellate Jurisdiction of the House of Lords'', 1856.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12187">'''Gustaf Nordenskiöld''' (29 June 1868 – 6 June 1895) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] scholar of [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swedish]] descent who was the first to scientifically study the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|ancient Pueblo]] ruins in [[Mesa Verde National Park#Gustaf Nordenski.C3.B6ld|Mesa Verde]]. He was a member of the [[Nordenskiöld (surname)|Nordenskiöld]] family of scientists and the eldest son of polar explorer [[Baron]] [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld]] and his equally aristocratic wife, Anna Maria [[Mannerheim (family)|Mannerheim]].
[[File:Mesa-Verde---Cliff-Palace-in 1891 - edit1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Cliff Palace]] at [[Mesa Verde National Park#Early history|Mesa Verde]], photo by Gustaf Nordenskiöld, 1891]]

Nordenskiöld was featured on the [[Ken Burns]] PBS series ''[[The National Parks: America's Best Idea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
Nordenskiöld completed school at [[Beskowska skolan]] in Stockholm and studied at [[Uppsala University]] and the new [[University of Stockholm]], graduating with a B.A. from Uppsala in 1889. The next year (1890) he traveled to [[Svalbard]] together with [[J. A. Björling]] and [[A. Klinckowström]], bringing a collection of plant fossils back to the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]]. After his return, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and went to Berlin for treatment.

==Nordenskiöld in America==
Nordenskiöld's North American segment of a world tour began when he landed in New York on 27 May 1891 aboard the SS Waesland of the Red Star Line. (Letters    Letter No. 2, The Letters of Gustaf Nordenskiöld Mesa Verde 1991). In Letter No. 9 from [[Charleston, Halifax County, North Carolina|Charleston, North Carolina]], he tells his father to address letters to the Swedish Consulate in San Francisco and on 27 June 1891 he wrote to his mother from [[Denver]], Colorado, and included a request that further letters be addressed to the Swedish Consulate in Yokohama, Japan, so the world tour was still on his mind. Three days later, on 30 June 1891, also from Denver, he tells his father that tomorrow he was going to [[Durango, Colorado]], and the "Mancos Valley" where there are a "number of cliff dwellings".

This break in the intinerary of his world tour was permanent.

When Nordenskiöld arrived in Durango he made arrangements to stay with cattle rancher [[Richard Wetherill]] at the Alamo Ranch in [[Mancos, Colorado]].  This is confirmed in a 2 July 1893 letter to his father in which he requests his photographic equipment, consisting of camera, tripod, lens, cassette for photographic plates, shutter, dark cloth, and "as well as my barometer". (Letters Letter No. 15, The Letters of Gustaf Nordenskiöld Mesa Verde 1991.) He also says in the same letter that his father should answer by telegram whether he should remain where he is.
 
He worked with Wetherill, discoverer of the Mesa Verde ruins in 1888, and Charles Mason. The Wetherill's led Nordenskiöld through the canyons and sandstone cliffs of the Mesa Verde ruins where he applied his European scientific training, conducting the first archaeological excavation of the cliff dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, David R. Fowler, Don D. (Summer 2002). "The beginnings of anthropological archaeology in the North American Southwest: from Thomas Jefferson to the Pecos Conference." ''[[Journal of the Southwest]]'' 44.2 : p121(114).&lt;/ref&gt; Nordenskiöld employed Wetherill to supervise excavations at Mesa Verde and trained Wetherill in a number of techniques, such as how to use a [[trowel]] (he had been using a shovel). Nordenskiöld explained to Wetherill the importance of documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, David. (Dec 1993). "'Reverse archaeologists' are tracing the footsteps of a cowboy-explorer." ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]''. v24.n9 : pp28(10).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and exoneration==
In the late 19th century, there were no laws against treasure-hunting or selling artifacts in Colorado;&lt;ref name=Chalmers&gt;Chalmers, Robin. (Sept 1999). "A Historic Rediscovery." ''[[Cobblestone]]''. 20.6. p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the ever-present threat of vandalism and looting, scholars and tourists alike had the habit of taking valuable items from Mesa Verde as trophies.&lt;ref name=Noel&gt;Noel, Tom. (Jan 1, 2005). "Two Women Ensured a Future for Our Past". ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''. p2D.&lt;/ref&gt; In this climate, Nordenskiöld loaded Mesa Verde artifacts into [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] boxcars in [[Durango, Colorado]],&lt;ref name=Noel/&gt; and headed for Europe, with most of the items eventually ending up at the [[National Museum of Finland]].&lt;ref name=Draper1&gt;Draper, Electra. (June 26, 2006). "Mesa Verde artifacts ended up in Sweden." ''[[The Denver Post]]''. pB-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordenskiöld biographers Judith Reynolds and David Reynolds describe the ensuing situation as an "international incident."&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;Draper, Electra. (Dec 9, 2005). "Mesa Verde sites glow for park's birthday bash." ''[[The Denver Post]]''. p. A01.&lt;/ref&gt; Angry locals charged Nordenskiöld with "devastating the ruins" and had him arrested at midnight at the Strater Hotel even though there were no laws at the time supporting such a charge.&lt;ref name=Draper1/&gt; In addition to the issue of removing artifacts, [[xenophobia]] may have played a role in Nordenskiöld's arrest. In the December 9, 2005, ''Denver Post'' article, Electra Draper wrote: "...residents of Durango were beginning to think foreigners shouldn't be removing local artifacts."&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt; No intervention was taken against Americans who were also looting the sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael C. FitzGerald]], [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123697765848223641 "The Majesty of Mesa Verde"] in ''Wall Street Journal'', 2009 March 13, p. W12.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nordenskiöld was arrested on 17 September 1891 he sent this telegram to his father: "much trouble some expense no danger" (original omits capitalization). Letters Letter No. 31, The Letters of Gustaf Nordenskiöld Mesa Verde 1991.

In the end, Nordenskiöld took more than 150 photographs of Mesa Verde, and logged multiple sites.

In the preface to his 1892 book "From the American West Memories of America" Nordenskiöld states "The free roaming nomadic life, which this research forced me into, appealed greatly to my spirit and created a desire for excursions farther into the deserts of the American West. I decided to go roaming on horseback with two companions through the northern part of Arizona." He made this trip, actually through Indian country in Colorado, Utah and Arizona, which went as far as the Grand Canyon. Originally published in a Stockholm Newspaper and later as a book, "From the Far West Memories from America". (Kungl. Boktryckeriet P.A. Norstedt &amp; Soner Stockholm, 1892. In English, The Mesa Verde Museum Association, Mesa Verde National Park, CO 81330)

In 1893 published one of the first books about Mesa Verde, ''The Cliff Dwellers of Mesa Verde, Southwestern Colorado: Their Pottery and Implements'', a monumental report of his excavations, describing in detail the buildings, pottery, skeletal remains, and tools found at the sites.&lt;ref name=Chalmers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bear&gt;Bear, David. (Sept 6, 2001). "Blackened Mesa Verde is Reborn to the Hardy Curious". ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''. p8.&lt;/ref&gt;

A full rendering of Gustaf Nordenskiöld's book in the 1893 version (see pg. v) is here http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000029476458. (Courtesy of the Hilthi Trust Digital Library, University of Michigan Library.)

After his return from America, Nordenskiöld occupied himself with mineralogical studies, but his health started to deteriorate again in 1894.  He died on June 6, 1895, aboard a train traveling to [[Jämtland]], only 27 years old.

As he predeceased his father [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld|the Baron]], he did not inherit the family title, which therefore passed to his brother [[Erland Nordenskiöld|Erland]], on the death of their father, in 1901.

== Archives and collections ==
Nordenskiöld's collections from Mesa Verde were bought by a Finnish collector who eventually donated them to the [[University of Helsinki]]. They are now held by the National Museum of Finland and were on display at the ''Museum of Cultures'' in the [[Tennispalatsi]] building in central Helsinki, as part of the collection called "Fetched from Afar" (Kaukaa Haettua) until 19 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.fi/fi/kaukaa_haettua, |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611230439/http://www.nba.fi/fi/kaukaa_haettua, |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}   {{cite web |url=http://www.nba.fi/en/kumu_exhibitions_permanent. |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611230507/http://www.nba.fi/en/kumu_exhibitions_permanent. |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] contains an archive of photographs, notes, correspondence and newspaper clippings. The [[National Archives of Sweden|Riksarkivet]] includes letters to his father from Washington, Philadelphia, Charleston, [[Mammoth Cave]] (in Kentucky), Durango, Navajo Canyon, and other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, Christer.

==Education and career==
In 1966 Lenowitz received his B.A. in English from the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  He received his Ph.D. in Linguistics in 1971, also from the University of Texas at Austin. He remained at the university as a lecturer in 1971–1972.  In 1972, he joined the faculty of the University of Utah as an assistant professor.  He became an associate professor in 1976 and a full professor in 1989.

==Lawsuit==
Lenowitz formerly belonged to the governing committee of the University of Utah's Middle East Center, one of only a handful of such centers in the United States. Robert Newman, then the University of Utah's dean of humanities, removed him from the governing committee,&lt;ref name="deseret" /&gt; and in 2009 Lenowitz filed a lawsuit against Newman, claiming that Newman unfairly accused him of contributing to a hostile environment that had driven away several female faculty members.  Lenowitz had previously denied Newman's claims, saying that the female faculty members had left for higher-paying posts at prestigious schools.&lt;ref name="saltlaketribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/7249 |title=U.

The '''history of theatre''' charts the development of [[theatre]] over the past 2,500 years. While performative elements are present in every society, it is customary to acknowledge a distinction between theatre as an [[art form]] and entertainment and ''theatrical'' or ''performative'' elements in other activities. The history of theatre is primarily concerned with the origin and subsequent development of the theatre as an [[autonomous]] activity. Since [[classical Athens]] in the 6th century BC, vibrant traditions of theatre have flourished in cultures across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1995), Brockett and Hildy (2003), and Goldhill (1997, 54).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Theatre arose as a performance of ritual activities that did not require initiation on the part of the spectator. This similarity of early theatre to ritual is negatively attested by [[Aristotle]], who in his ''Poetics'' defined theatre in contrast to the performances of [[sacred mysteries]]: theatre did not require the spectator to fast, drink the [[kykeon]], or march in a procession; however theatre did resemble the sacred mysteries in the sense that it brought purification and healing to the spectator by means of a vision, the ''theama''. The physical location of such performances was accordingly named ''theatron''.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historians Oscar Brockett and Franklin Hildy, rituals typically include elements that entertain or give pleasure, such as [[costumes]] and [[masks]] as well as skilled performers. As societies grew more complex, these spectacular elements began to be acted out under non-ritualistic conditions. As this occurred, the first steps towards theatre as an autonomous activity were being taken.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (1968; 10th ed. 2010), ''History of the Theater'' .&lt;/ref&gt;

==European theatre==

===Greek theatre=== 
[[File:07Epidaurus Theater08.jpg|thumb|right|305px|The best-preserved example of a classical Greek theatre, the Theatre of [[Epidaurus]], has a circular ''orchêstra'' and probably gives the best idea of the original shape of the Athenian theatre, though it dates from the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (2005, 197) and Taplin (2003, 10).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek comedy|Satyr play}}
Greek theatre, most developed in [[classical Athens|Athens]], is the root of the Western tradition; ''theatre'' is in origin a Greek word. It was part of a broader [[culture]] of theatricality and performance in [[classical Greece]] that included [[Athenian festivals|festivals]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious rituals]], [[Ancient Greece#Political structure|politics]], [[Ancient Greek law|law]], athletics and gymnastics, [[Music of ancient Greece|music]], [[Ancient Greek literature#Classical and Pre-Classical Antiquity|poetry]], weddings, funerals, and ''[[Symposium|symposia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge (1997, 3, 6), Goldhill (1997, 54) and (1999, 20-xx), and Rehm (1992. 3). Goldhill argues that although activities that form "an integral part of the exercise of citizenship" (such as when "the Athenian citizen speaks in the Assembly, exercises in the gymnasium, sings at the symposium, or courts a boy") each have their "own regime of display and regulation," nevertheless the term "performance" provides "a useful heuristic category to explore the connections and overlaps between these different areas of activity" (1999, 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in the city-state's many festivals—and attendance at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] as an audience member (or even as a participant in the theatrical productions) in particular—was an important part of [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelling (2005, 83).&lt;/ref&gt; Civic participation also involved the evaluation of the [[rhetoric]] of [[orators]] evidenced in performances in the [[Athenian law court (classical period)|law-court]] or [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|political assembly]], both of which were understood as analogous to the theatre and increasingly came to absorb its dramatic vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhill (1999, 25) and Pelling (2005, 83–84).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Greece]] consisted of three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tragedy#Greek|Athenian tragedy]]—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995, 441), Cartledge (1997, 3–5), Goldhill (1997, 54), Ley (2007, 206), and Styan (2000, 140). Taxidou notes that "most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct" (2004, 104).&lt;/ref&gt; Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BC, it flowered during the 5th century BC (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world) and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 32–33), Brown (1995, 444), and Cartledge (1997, 3–5). Cartledge writes that although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honoured their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]]. If not attaining the quality and stature of the fifth-century 'classics', original tragedies nonetheless continued to be written and produced and competed with in large numbers throughout the remaining life of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]—and beyond it" (1997, 33).&lt;/ref&gt; No tragedies from the 6th century and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in during the 5th century have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15) and Kovacs (2005, 379). We have seven by [[Aeschylus]], seven by [[Sophocles]], and eighteen by [[Euripides]]. In addition, we also have the ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', a [[satyr play]] by Euripides. Some critics since the 17th century have argued that one of the tragedies that the classical tradition gives as Euripides'—''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]''—is a 4th-century play by an unknown author; modern scholarship agrees with the classical authorities and ascribes the play to Euripides; see Walton (1997, viii, xix). (This uncertainty accounts for Brockett and Hildy's figure of 31 tragedies rather than 32.)&lt;/ref&gt; We have complete texts [[Extant literature|extant]] by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15). The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] adds a fourth, anonymous playwright to those whose work survives.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century it was [[institution]]alised in competitions (''[[agon]]'') held as part of festivities celebrating [[Dionysos]] (the [[Family tree of the Greek gods|god]] of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13–15) and Brown (1995, 441–447).&lt;/ref&gt; As contestants in the City Dionysia's competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama), playwrights were required to present a [[tetralogy]] of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–17). Exceptions to this pattern were made, as with [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'' in 438 BC. There were also separate competitions at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] for the performance of [[dithyramb]]s and, after 488–7 BC, [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]].&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of tragedies at the City Dionysia may have begun as early as 534 BC; official records (''didaskaliai'') begin from 501 BC, when the satyr play was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 13, 15) and Brown (1995, 442). Rehm offers the following argument as evidence that tragedy was not institutionalized until 501 BC: "The specific cult honoured at the [[Dionysia#City Dionysia|City Dionysia]] was that of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the god 'having to do with [[Eleutherae]]', a town on the border between [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] that had a sanctuary to Dionysus. At some point [[Classical Athens|Athens]] annexed Eleutherae—most likely after the overthrow of the [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratid]] tyranny in 510 and the democratic reforms of [[Cleisthenes]] in 508-07—and the cult-image of Dionysus Eleuthereus was moved to its new home. Athenians re-enacted the incorporation of the god's cult every year in a preliminary rite to the City Dionysia. On the day before the festival proper, the cult-statue was removed from the [[Greek temple|temple]] near the [[theatre of Dionysus]] and taken to a temple on the road to Eleutherae. That evening, after [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] and [[hymn]]s, a torchlight procession carried the statue back to the temple, a symbolic re-creation of the god's arrival into Athens, as well as a reminder of the inclusion of the Boeotian town into Attica. As the name Eleutherae is extremely close to eleutheria, 'freedom', Athenians probably felt that the new cult was particularly appropriate for celebrating their own political liberation and democratic reforms" (1992, 15).&lt;/ref&gt; Most Athenian tragedies dramatise events from [[Greek mythology]], though ''[[The Persians]]''—which stages the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] response to news of their military defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in 480 BC—is the notable exception in the surviving drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995, 442). [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]] argues that in ''[[The Persians]]'' [[Aeschylus]] substitutes for the usual temporal distance between the audience and the [[Greek Heroic Age|age of heroes]] a spatial distance between the Western audience and the Eastern [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian culture]]. This substitution, he suggests, produces a similar effect: "The 'historic' events evoked by the chorus, recounted by the messenger and interpreted by Darius' ghost are presented on stage in a legendary atmosphere. The light that the tragedy sheds upon them is not that in which the political happenings of the day are normally seen; it reaches the Athenian theater refracted from a distant world of elsewhere, making what is absent seem present and visible on the stage"; Vernant and Vidal-Naquet (1988, 245).&lt;/ref&gt; When Aeschylus won first prize for it at the City Dionysia in 472 BC, he had been writing tragedies for more than 25 years, yet its tragic treatment of recent history is the earliest example of drama to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1995, 442) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–16).&lt;/ref&gt; More than 130 years later, the philosopher [[Aristotle]] analysed 5th-century Athenian tragedy in the oldest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]]—his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BC). [[Ancient Greek comedy|Athenian comedy]] is conventionally divided into three periods, "Old Comedy", "Middle Comedy", and "New Comedy". Old Comedy survives today largely in the form of the eleven surviving plays of [[Aristophanes]], while Middle Comedy is largely lost (preserved only in relatively short fragments in authors such as [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]]). New Comedy is known primarily from the substantial papyrus fragments of plays by [[Menander]]. Aristotle defined comedy as a representation of laughable people that involves some kind of error or ugliness that does not cause pain or destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': "Comedy is, as we said, a representation of people who are rather inferior—not, however, with respect to every [kind of] vice, but the laughable is [only] a part of what is ugly. For the laughable is a sort of error and ugliness that is not painful and destructive, just as, evidently, a laughable mask is something ugly and distorted without pain" (1449a 30–35); see Janko (1987, 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman theatre===
[[File:Orange roman theatre.jpg|right|thumb|305px|Roman theatre at [[Orange, France]]]]
{{Main article|Theatre of ancient Rome}}
Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The Roman historian [[Livy]] wrote that the Romans first experienced theatre in the 4th century BC, with a performance by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] actors.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Beacham argues that Romans had been familiar with "pre-theatrical practices" for some time before that recorded contact.&lt;ref&gt;Beacham (1996, 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to the [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BC had a profound and energizing effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of [[Latin literature]] of the highest quality for the stage.

Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BC) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BC, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]].&lt;ref name="h43"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43).&lt;/ref&gt; From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC-476 AD), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and reached England; Roman theatre was more varied, extensive and sophisticated than that of any culture before it.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 36, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; While Greek drama continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BC marks the beginning of regular Roman drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 43). For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of the empire, however, interest in full-length drama declined in favour of a broader variety of theatrical entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 46–47).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] that [[Livius Andronicus]] wrote from 240 BC.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47).&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write drama.&lt;ref name="h47"/&gt; No plays from either writer have survived. While both dramatists composed in both [[genres]], Andronicus was most appreciated for his tragedies and Naevius for his comedies; their successors tended to specialise in one or the other, which led to a separation of the subsequent development of each type of drama.&lt;ref name="h47"/&gt; By the beginning of the 2nd century BC, drama was firmly established in Rome and a [[guild]] of writers (''collegium poetarum'') had been formed.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman comedies that have survived are all ''[[fabula palliata]]'' (comedies based on Greek subjects) and come from two dramatists: [[Plautus|Titus Maccius Plautus]] (Plautus) and [[Terence|Publius Terentius Afer]] (Terence).&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48–49).&lt;/ref&gt; In re-working the Greek originals, the Roman comic dramatists abolished the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] in dividing the drama into [[episode]]s and introduced musical accompaniment to its [[dialogue]] (between one-third of the dialogue in the comedies of Plautus and two-thirds in those of Terence).&lt;ref name="h49"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49).&lt;/ref&gt; The action of all scenes is set in the exterior location of a street and its complications often follow from [[eavesdropping]].&lt;ref name="h49"/&gt; Plautus, the more popular of the two, wrote between 205 and 184 BC and twenty of his comedies survive, of which his [[farce]]s are best known; he was admired for the [[wit]] of his dialogue and his use of a variety of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meters]].&lt;ref name="h48"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; All of the six comedies that Terence wrote between 166 and 160 BC have survived; the complexity of his plots, in which he often combined several Greek originals, was sometimes denounced, but his double-plots enabled a sophisticated presentation of contrasting human behaviour.&lt;ref name="h48"/&gt;

No early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three early tragedians—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]].&lt;ref name="h49"/&gt; From the time of the empire, the work of two tragedians survives—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref name="h50"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 50).&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of Seneca's tragedies survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 49–50).&lt;/ref&gt; Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.&lt;ref name="h50"/&gt;

===&lt;big&gt;Transition and early Medieval theatre, 500–1050&lt;/big&gt;===
{{Main article|Medieval theatre}}
As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], today called the [[Byzantine Empire]]. While surviving evidence about Byzantine theatre is slight, existing records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. Constantinople had two theatres that were in use as late as the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 70)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the true importance of the Byzantines in theatrical history is their preservation of many classical Greek texts and the compilation of a massive encyclopedia called the [[Suda]], from which is derived a large amount of contemporary information on Greek theatre.

From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder that lasted (with a brief period of stability under the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the 9th century) until the 10th century. As such, most organized theatrical activities disappeared in [[Western Europe]]. While it seems that small nomadic bands traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience, there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)&lt;/ref&gt; These performers were denounced by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] as they were viewed as dangerous and pagan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{See also|Antitheatricality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roswitha of Gandersheim.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Hrosvitha]] of Gandersheim, the first dramatist of the post-classical era.]]

By the [[Early Middle Ages]], churches in [[Europe]] began staging dramatized versions of particular biblical events on specific days of the year. These dramatizations were included in order to vivify annual celebrations.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76)&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic objects and actions – [[vestments]], [[altar]]s, [[censer]]s, and [[pantomime]] performed by priests – recalled the events which Christian ritual celebrates. These were extensive sets of visual signs that could be used to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. These performances developed into [[liturgical drama]]s, the earliest of which is the ''Whom do you Seek (Quem-Quaeritis)'' Easter trope, dating from ca. 925.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,76"/&gt; Liturgical drama was sung responsively by two groups and did not involve actors impersonating characters. However, sometime between 965 and 975, [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] composed the ''Regularis Concordia (Monastic Agreement)'' which contains a playlet complete with directions for performance.&lt;ref name="Brockett and Hildy 2003, 77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hrosvitha]] (c. 935 – 973), a canoness in northern [[Germany]], wrote six plays modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies but using religious subjects. These six plays – ''Abraham, Callimachus, Dulcitius, Gallicanus, Paphnutius, ''and ''Sapientia'' – are the first known plays composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western dramatic works of the post-classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett and Hildy 2003, 77"/&gt; They were first published in 1501 and had considerable influence on religious and didactic plays of the sixteenth century. Hrosvitha was followed by [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (d. 1179), a [[Benedictine]] abbess, who wrote a [[Latin]] [[music]]al drama called ''Ordo Virtutum'' in 1155.

===High and late Medieval theatre, 1050–1500===

{{Main article|Medieval theatre}}

As the [[Viking]] invasions ceased in the middle of the 11th century, [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. Only in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim-occupied Spain]] were liturgical dramas not presented at all. Despite the large number of liturgical dramas that have survived from the period, many churches would have only performed one or two per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Feast of Fools]] was especially important in the development of comedy. The festival inverted the status of the lesser clergy and allowed them to ridicule their superiors and the routine of church life. Sometimes plays were staged as part of the occasion and a certain amount of [[burlesque]] and [[comedy]] crept into these performances. Although comic episodes had to truly wait until the separation of drama from the liturgy, the Feast of Fools undoubtedly had a profound effect on the development of comedy in both religious and secular plays.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 81)&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance of religious plays outside of the church began sometime in the 12th century through a traditionally accepted process of merging shorter liturgical dramas into longer plays which were then translated into [[vernacular]] and performed by laymen. ''[[The Play of Adam|The Mystery of Adam]] '' (1150) gives credence to this theory as its detailed stage direction suggest that it was staged outdoors. A number of other plays from the period survive, including ''La Seinte Resurrection'' ([[Normans|Norman]]), ''The Play of the Magi Kings'' ([[Spain|Spanish]]), and ''Sponsus'' ([[France|French]]).

The importance of the [[High Middle Ages]] in the development of theatre was the [[economic]] and [[political]] changes that led to the formation of [[guilds]] and the growth of towns. This would lead to significant changes in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. In the [[British Isles]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] were written in cycles of a large number of plays: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and [[N-Town Plays|Unknown]] (42). A larger number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Many of these plays contained [[comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. For example, at [[Valenciennes]] in 1547, more than 100 roles were assigned to 72 actors.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 95)&lt;/ref&gt; Plays were staged on [[pageant wagon]] stages, which were platforms mounted on wheels used to move scenery. Often providing their own costumes, amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers. The platform stage, which was an unidentified space and not a specific locale, allowed for abrupt changes in location.

[[Morality plays]] emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550. The most interesting morality play is ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' which depicts [[Human|mankind]]'s progress from birth to death. However, the most famous morality play and perhaps best known medieval drama is ''[[Everyman]]''. Everyman receives [[Death]]'s summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by [[Kinship|Kindred]], [[Good (economics)|Goods]], and [[Fellow]]ship – only [[Good works|Good Deeds]] goes with him to the grave.

There were also a number of secular performances staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folk culture|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from [[France]] and [[Germany]] and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing [[sex]] and bodily excretions.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 96)&lt;/ref&gt; The best known playwright of farces is [[Hans Sachs]] (1494–1576) who wrote 198 dramatic works. In England, [[The Second Shepherds' Play]] of the [[Wakefield Cycle]] is the best known early farce. However, farce did not appear independently in England until the 16th century with the work of [[John Heywood]] (1497–1580).

A significant forerunner of the development of [[Elizabethan]] drama was the [[Chamber of rhetoric|Chambers of Rhetoric]] in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 99)&lt;/ref&gt; These societies were concerned with [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[drama]] and held contests to see which society could compose the best drama in relation to a question posed.

At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the [[Great Hall]] of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a "screen" at the other for the actors. Also important were [[Mummers Play|Mummers' plays]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season, and court [[masque]]s. These masques were especially popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] who had a House of Revels built and an [[Master of the Revels|Office of Revels]] established in 1545.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,101-103"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101–103)&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of medieval drama came about due to a number of factors, including the weakening power of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the banning of religious plays in many countries. [[Elizabeth I]] forbid all religious plays in 1558 and the great cycle plays had been silenced by the 1580s. Similarly, religious plays were banned in the [[Netherlands]] in 1539, the [[Papal States]] in 1547 and in [[Paris]] in 1548. The abandonment of these plays destroyed the international theatre that had thereto existed and forced each country to develop its own form of drama. It also allowed dramatists to turn to secular subjects and the reviving interest in [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] theatre provided them with the perfect opportunity.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,101-103"/&gt;

{{Main article|Commedia dell'arte}}
''Commedia dell'arte'' troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. It originated in Italy in the 1560s. ''Commedia dell'arte'' was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called ''[[lazzi]]'', which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The plays utilised [[stock character]]s, which could be divided into three groups: the lovers, the masters, and the servants. The lovers had different names and characteristics in most plays and often were the children of the master. The role of master was normally based on one of three stereotypes: [[Pantalone]], an elderly Venetian merchant; [[Dottore]], Pantalone's friend or rival, a [[pedant]]ic doctor or lawyer who acted far more intelligent than he really was; and [[Capitano]], who was once a lover character, but evolved into a [[braggart]] who boasted of his exploits in love and war, but was often terrifically unskilled in both. He normally carried a sword and wore a cape and feathered headdress. The servant character (called ''[[zanni]]'') had only one recurring role: [[Arlecchino]] (also called [[Harlequin]]). He was both cunning and ignorant, but an accomplished dancer and acrobat. He typically carried a wooden stick with a split in the middle so it made a loud noise when striking something. This "weapon" gave us the term "[[slapstick]]".

A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid by taking a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the size of their role. The style of theatre was in its peak from 1575 to 1650, but even after that time new scenarios were written and performed. The Venetian playwright [[Carlo Goldoni]] wrote a few scenarios starting in 1734, but since he considered the genre too vulgar, he refined the topics of his own to be more sophisticated. He also wrote several plays based on real events, in which he included ''commedia'' characters.

=== English Elizabethan theatre===

{{Main article|English Renaissance theatre}}
Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as,  the mystery plays that formed a part of religious festivals in England and other parts of Europe during the Middle Ages. Other sources include the "[[morality play]]s" and the "University drama" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of ''Commedia dell'arte'', as well as the elaborate [[masque]]s frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre.

Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, [[Playing company|companies of players]] were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the Elizabethan stage. The tours of these players gradually replaced the performances of the mystery and morality plays by local players, and a 1572 law eliminated the remaining companies lacking formal patronage by labelling them [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s.

The City of London authorities were generally hostile to public performances, but its hostility was overmatched by the Queen's taste for plays and the Privy Council's support. Theatres sprang up in suburbs, especially in the liberty of Southwark, accessible across the Thames to city dwellers but beyond the authority's control. The companies maintained the pretence that their public performances were mere rehearsals for the frequent performances before the Queen, but while the latter did grant prestige, the former were the real source of the income for the professional players.

Along with the economics of the profession, the character of the drama changed toward the end of the period. Under Elizabeth, the drama was a unified expression as far as social class was concerned: the Court watched the same plays the commoners saw in the public playhouses. With the development of the private theatres, drama became more oriented toward the tastes and values of an upper-class audience. By the later part of the reign of Charles I, few new plays were being written for the public theatres, which sustained themselves on the accumulated works of the previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr (1992, 12–18).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Puritan]] opposition to the stage (informed by the arguments of the early Church Fathers who had written screeds against the decadent and violent entertainments of the Romans) argued not only that the stage in general was [[pagan]], but that any play that represented a religious figure was inherently [[Idolatry|idolatrous]]. In 1642, at the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]], the Protestant authorities banned the performance of all plays within the city limits of London. A sweeping assault against the alleged immoralities of the theatre crushed whatever remained in England of the dramatic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{See also|Antitheatricality#English Renaissance theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Love in a Tub.png|thumb|Refinement meets burlesque in [[Restoration comedy]]. In this scene from [[George Etherege]]'s ''Love in a Tub'' (1664), musicians and well-bred ladies surround a man who is wearing a tub because he has lost his [[trousers]].]]
After public stage performances had been banned for 18 years by the Puritan regime, the re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. With the restoration of the monarch in 1660 came the restoration of and the reopening of the theatre. English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called "Restoration comedy". Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness, a quality encouraged by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (1660–1685) personally and by the [[rake (character)|rakish]] [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[ethos]] of his [[noble court|court]]. For the first time women were allowed to act, putting an end to the practice of the [[Boy player|boy-player]] taking the parts of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{See also|Antitheatricality#Restoration theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Socially diverse audiences included both aristocrats, their servants and hangers-on, and a substantial middle-class segment. Restoration audiences liked to see good triumph in their tragedies and rightful government restored. In comedy they liked to see the love-lives of the young and fashionable, with a central couple bringing their courtship to a successful conclusion (often overcoming the opposition of the elders to do so). Heroines had to be chaste, but were independent-minded and outspoken; now that they were played by women, there was more mileage for the playwright in disguising them in men's clothes or giving them narrow escape from rape.  These playgoers were attracted to the comedies by up-to-the-minute topical writing, by crowded and bustling [[Plot (narrative)|plots]], by the introduction of the first professional actresses, and by the rise of the first celebrity actors. To non-theatre-goers these comedies were widely seen as licentious and morally suspect, holding up the antics of a small, privileged, and decadent class for admiration. This same class dominated the audiences of the Restoration theatre.  This period saw the first professional woman playwright, [[Aphra Behn]].

As a reaction to the decadence of Charles II era productions, [[sentimental comedy]] grew in popularity. This genre focused on encouraging virtuous behavior by showing middle class characters overcoming a series of moral trials. Playwrights like [[Colley Cibber]] and [[Richard Steele]] believed that humans were inherently good but capable of being led astray. Through plays such as [[The Conscious Lovers]] and [[Love's Last Shift]] they strove to appeal to an audience's noble sentiments in order that viewers could be reformed.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=William|title=Sentimental Comedy in England and on the Continent|url=http://www.bartleby.com/220/0402.html|website=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|publisher=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harman|first1=William|title=A Handbook to Literature|date=2011|publisher=Longman|isbn=0205024017|edition=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration spectacular===
{{Main article|Restoration spectacular}}
The '''Restoration spectacular''', or elaborately staged "machine play", hit the [[London]] public stage in the late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period, enthralling audiences with action, music, dance, moveable [[theatrical scenery|scenery]], [[baroque illusionistic painting]], gorgeous costumes, and [[special effect]]s such as [[trapdoor]] tricks, "flying" actors, and [[fireworks]]. These shows have always had a bad reputation as a vulgar and commercial threat to the witty, "legitimate" [[Restoration drama]]; however, they drew Londoners in unprecedented numbers and left them dazzled and delighted.

Basically home-grown and with roots in the early 17th-century [[court]] [[masque]], though never ashamed of borrowing ideas and stage technology from [[French opera]], the spectaculars are sometimes called "English opera". However, the variety of them is so untidy that most theatre historians despair of defining them as a [[genre]] at all.&lt;ref&gt;Hume (1976, 205).&lt;/ref&gt; Only a handful of works of this period are usually accorded the term "opera", as the musical dimension of most of them is subordinate to the visual. It was spectacle and scenery that drew in the crowds, as shown by many comments in the diary of the theatre-lover [[Samuel Pepys]].&lt;ref&gt;Hume (1976, 206–209).&lt;/ref&gt; The expense of mounting ever more elaborate scenic productions drove the two competing theatre companies into a dangerous spiral of huge expenditure and correspondingly huge losses or profits. A fiasco such as [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[Albion and Albanius]]'' would leave a company in serious debt, while blockbusters like [[Thomas Shadwell]]'s ''[[Psyche (Locke)|Psyche]]'' or Dryden's ''[[King Arthur (opera)|King Arthur]]'' would put it comfortably in the black for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous (1979, 47–48).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical theatre===

{{Further information|Neoclassicism}}
[[File:Ostankino19.JPG|thumb|An 18th-century Neoclassical theatre in [[Ostankino Palace|Ostankino]], [[Moscow]]]]
[[Neoclassicism]] was the dominant form of theatre in the 18th century. It demanded [[decorum]] and rigorous adherence to the [[classical unities]]. Neoclassical theatre as well as the time period is characterized by its grandiosity. The costumes and scenery were intricate and elaborate. The acting is characterized by large gestures and melodrama. Neoclassical theatre encompasses the Restoration, Augustan, and Johnstinian Ages. In one sense, the neo-classical age directly follows the time of the Renaissance.

Theatres of the early 18th century – sexual farces of the Restoration were superseded by politically satirical comedies, 1737 Parliament passed the Stage Licensing Act which introduced state censorship of public performances and limited the number of theatres in London to two.&lt;ref&gt;{{See also|Antitheatricality#18th century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth-century theatre===
{{Main article|Nineteenth-century theatre}}
Theatre in the 19th century is divided into two parts: early and late. The early period was dominated by [[melodrama]] and [[Romanticism]].

Beginning in [[France]], melodrama became the most popular theatrical form. [[August von Kotzebue]]'s ''Misanthropy and Repentance'' (1789) is often considered the first melodramatic play. The plays of Kotzebue and [[René Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt]] established melodrama as the dominant dramatic form of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 277).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], there was a trend toward historic accuracy in [[Stage clothes|costumes]] and [[Set construction|settings]], a revolution in theatre architecture, and the introduction of the theatrical form of [[German Romanticism]]. Influenced by trends in [[19th-century philosophy]] and the [[visual arts]], German writers were increasingly fascinated with their [[Teutons|Teutonic]] past and had a growing sense of [[Romantic nationalism|nationalism]]. The plays of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], and other ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' playwrights, inspired a growing faith in feeling and instinct as guides to moral behavior.

[[File:Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton by Henry William Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]].]]
In [[Theatre of the United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron]] were the most important dramatists of their time (although Shelley's plays were not performed until later in the century). In the minor theatres, [[burletta]] and [[melodrama]] were the most popular. Kotzebue's plays were translated into English and [[Thomas Holcroft]]'s ''A Tale of Mystery'' was the first of many English melodramas. [[Pierce Egan]], [[Douglas William Jerrold]], [[Edward Fitzball]], and [[John Baldwin Buckstone]] initiated a trend towards more contemporary and rural stories in preference to the usual historical or fantastical melodramas. [[James Sheridan Knowles]] and [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] established a "gentlemanly" drama that began to re-establish the former prestige of the theatre with the [[aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 297–298).&lt;/ref&gt;

The later period of the 19th century saw the rise of two conflicting types of drama: [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and non-realism, such as [[Symbolist theater|Symbolism]] and precursors of [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]].

Realism began earlier in the 19th century in Russia than elsewhere in Europe and took a more uncompromising form.&lt;ref name=BH370&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370).&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the plays of [[Ivan Turgenev]] (who used "domestic detail to reveal inner turmoil"), [[Aleksandr Ostrovsky]] (who was Russia's first professional playwright), [[Aleksey Pisemsky]] (whose ''[[A Bitter Fate]]'' (1859) anticipated [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]]), and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (whose ''[[The Power of Darkness]]'' (1886) is "one of the most effective of naturalistic plays"), a tradition of psychological realism in Russia culminated with the establishment of the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] by [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 370, 372) and Benedetti (2005, 100) and (1999, 14–17).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important theatrical force in later 19th-century Germany was that of [[Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]] and his [[Meiningen Ensemble]], under the direction of [[Ludwig Chronegk]]. The Ensemble's productions are often considered the most historically accurate of the 19th century, although his primary goal was to serve the interests of the playwright. The Meiningen Ensemble stands at the beginning of the new movement toward unified production (or what [[Richard Wagner]] would call the ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'') and the rise of the [[theatre director|director]] (at the expense of the [[actor]]) as the dominant artist in theatre-making.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 357–359).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zuschauerraum des Bayreuther Festspielhauses (1870s engraving).png|thumb|left|[[Richard Wagner]]'s Bayreuth Festival Theatre.]]

[[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]], a theatrical movement born out of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859) and contemporary political and economic conditions, found its main proponent in [[Émile Zola]]. The realisation of Zola's ideas was hindered by a lack of capable dramatists writing naturalist drama. [[André Antoine]] emerged in the 1880s with his ''[[Théâtre Libre]]'' that was only open to members and therefore was exempt from censorship. He quickly won the approval of Zola and began to stage Naturalistic works and other foreign realistic pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 362–363).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ibsen-by-Bergen.jpg|thumb|[[Henrik Ibsen]], the "father" of realist and modern{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} drama.]]
In Britain, melodramas, light comedies, operas, Shakespeare and classic English drama, [[Victorian burlesque]], [[pantomimes]], translations of French farces and, from the 1860s, French operettas, continued to be popular. So successful were the [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], such as ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), that they greatly expanded the audience for musical theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 326–327).&lt;/ref&gt; This, together with much improved street lighting and transportation in London and New York led to a late Victorian and Edwardian theatre building boom in the West End and on Broadway. Later, the work of [[Henry Arthur Jones]] and [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] initiated a new direction on the English stage. While their work paved the way, the development of more significant drama owes itself most to the playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]].

Ibsen was born in [[Norway]] in 1828. He wrote twenty-five plays, the most famous of which are ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1881), ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884), and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890). In addition, his works ''[[Rosmersholm]]'' (1886) and ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'' (1899) evoke a sense of mysterious forces at work in human destiny, which was to be a major theme of [[Symbolist theatre|symbolism]] and the so-called "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]".{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

After Ibsen, British theatre experienced revitalization with the work of [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[William Butler Yeats]], and [[Harley Granville Barker]]. Unlike most of the gloomy and intensely serious work of their contemporaries, Shaw and Wilde wrote primarily in the [[Comedy (drama)|comic form]]. [[Edwardian musical comedies]] were extremely popular, appealing to the tastes of the middle class in the [[Gay Nineties]]&lt;ref&gt;The first "Edwardian musical comedy" is usually considered to be ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892). See, e.g., Charlton, Fraser.

While much [[Twentieth-century theatre|20th-century theatre]] continued and extended the projects of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]], there was also a great deal of [[experimental theatre]] that rejected those conventions. These experiments form part of the [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Postmodern theatre|postmodernist]] [[Art movement|movements]] and included forms of [[political theatre]] as well as more aesthetically orientated work. Examples include: [[Epic theater|Epic theatre]], the [[Theatre of Cruelty]], and the so-called "[[Theatre of the Absurd]]".

The term [[theatre practitioner]] came to be used to describe someone who both creates [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]]s and who produces a [[theory|theoretical]] [[discourse]] that informs their practical work.&lt;ref&gt;Milling and Ley (2001, vi, 173) and Pavis (1998, 280). {{lang-de|Theaterpraktiker}}, {{lang-fr|praticien}}, {{lang-es|teatrista}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A theatre practitioner may be a [[Theatre director|director]], a [[dramatist]], an [[actor]], or—characteristically—often a combination of these traditionally separate roles. "Theatre practice" describes the collective work that various theatre practitioners do.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 392).&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe theatre [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] from [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s development of his '[[Stanislavski's 'system'|system]]', through [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]]'s [[Biomechanics (Meyerhold)|biomechanics]], [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s [[Epic theatre|epic]] and [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s [[poor theatre]], down to the present day, with contemporary theatre practitioners including [[Augusto Boal]] with his [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], [[Dario Fo]]'s [[Popular Theatre|popular theatre]], [[Eugenio Barba]]'s [[theatre anthropology]] and [[Anne Bogart]]'s [[viewpoints]].&lt;ref&gt;McCullough (1996, 15–36) and Milling and Ley (2001, vii, 175).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other key figures of 20th-century theatre include: [[Antonin Artaud]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Harold Pinter]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Heiner Müller]], and [[Caryl Churchill]].

A number of [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] movements continued or emerged in the 20th century, including:
*[[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalism]]
*[[Realism (theatre)|Realism]]
*[[Dadaism]]
*[[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]]
*[[Surrealism]] and the [[Theatre of Cruelty]]
*[[Theatre of the Absurd]]
*[[Postmodern theatre|Postmodernism]]
*[[Agitprop]]

After the great popularity of the British [[Edwardian musical comedies]], the American [[musical theatre]] came to dominate the musical stage, beginning with the [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals, followed by the works of the Gershwin brothers, [[Cole Porter]], [[Jerome Kern]], [[Rodgers and Hart]], and later [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]].

==African theatre (including African-American)==

===Ancient Egyptian quasi-theatrical events===
The earliest recorded quasi-theatrical event dates back to 2000 BC with the "[[passion plays]]" of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The story of the god [[Osiris]] was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/origins/egypt001.html |title=Egyptian "Passion" Plays |publisher=Theatrehistory.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghanaian theatre===
Modern theatre in [[Ghana]] emerged in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abarry|first1=Abu|title=The Significance of Names in Ghanaian Drama|journal=Journal of Black Studies|date=Dec 1991|volume=22|doi=10.1177/002193479102200201}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It emerged first as literary comment on the colonization of Africa by Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Among the earliest work in which this can be seen is ''The Blinkards'' written by [[Kobina Sekyi]] in 1915. ''The Blinkards'' is a blatant satire about the Africans who embraced the European culture that was brought to them. In it Sekyi demeans three groups of individuals: anyone European, anyone who imitates the Europeans, and the rich African cocoa farmer. This sudden rebellion though was just the beginning spark of Ghanaian literary theater.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A play that has similarity in its satirical view is ''[[Anowa]]''. Written by Ghanaian author [[Ama Ata Aidoo]], it begins with its eponymous heroine Anowa rejecting her many arranged suitors' marriage proposals. She insists on making her own decisions as to whom she is going to marry. The play stresses the need for gender equality, and respect for women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This ideal of independence, as well as equality leads Anowa down a winding path of both happiness and misery. Anowa chooses a man of her own to marry. Anowa supports her husband Kofi both physically and emotionally. Through her support Kofi does prosper in wealth, but becomes poor as a spiritual being. Through his accumulation of wealth Kofi loses himself in it. His once happy marriage with Anowa becomes changed when he begins to hire slaves rather than doing any labor himself. This to Anowa does not make sense because it makes Kofi no better than the European colonists whom she detests for the way that she feels they have used the people of Africa. Their marriage is childless, which is presumed to have been caused by a ritual that Kofi has done trading his manhood for wealth. Anowa's viewing Kofi's slave-gotten wealth and inability to have a child leads to her committing suicide.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The name Anowa means "Superior moral force" while Kofi's means only "Born on Friday". This difference in even the basis of their names seems to implicate the moral superiority of women in a male run society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Another play of significance is ''The Marriage of Anansewa'', written in 1975 by [[Efua Sutherland]]. The entire play is based upon an Akan oral tradition called ''Anansesem''(folk tales). The main character of the play is [[Ananse]] (the spider). The qualities of Ananse are one of the most prevalent parts of the play. Ananse is cunning, selfish, has great insight into human and animal nature, is ambitious, eloquent, and resourceful. By putting too much of himself into everything that he does Ananse ruins each of his schemes and ends up poor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Ananse is used in the play as a kind of Everyman. He is written in an exaggerated sense in order to force the process of self-examination. Ananse is used as a way to spark a conversation for change in the society of anyone reading. The play tells of Ananse attempting to marry off his daughter Anansewa off to any of a selection of rich chiefs, or another sort of wealthy suitor simultaneously, in order to raise money. Eventually all the suitors come to his house at once, and he has to use all of his cunning to defuse the situation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The storyteller not only narrates but also enacts, reacts to, and comments on the action of the tale. Along with this, Mbuguous is used, Mbuguous is the name given to very specialized sect of Ghanaian theatre technique that allows for audience participation. The Mbuguous of this tale are songs that embellish the tale or comment on it. Spontaneity through this technique as well as improvisation are used enough to meet any standard of modern theatre.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Yoruba theatre===
{{see also|Yoruba literature}}
In his pioneering study of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] theatre, Joel Adedeji traced its origins to the [[Masquerade ceremony|masquerade]] of the [[Egungun]] (the "cult of the ancestor").&lt;ref&gt;Adedeji (1969, 60).&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[rite|ceremony]] culminates in the essence of the masquerade where it is deemed that ancestors return to the world of the living to visit their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Noret (2008, 26).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its origin in ritual, Yoruba theatre can be "traced to the 'theatrogenic' nature of a number of the deities in the [[Orisha#Pantheon|Yoruba pantheon]], such as [[Obatala]] the arch divinity, [[Ogoun|Ogun]] the divinity of creativeness, as well as Iron and technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Helen|title=Postcolonial Plays:An Anthology|date=May 31, 2001|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shango|Sango]] the divinity of the storm", whose reverence is imbued "with drama and theatre and the symbolic overall relevance in terms of its relative interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 88).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aláàrìnjó]] theatrical tradition sprang from the Egungun masquerade in the 16th century. The Aláàrìnjó was a troupe of traveling performers whose masked forms carried an air of mystique. They created short, [[Satire|satirical]] scenes that drew on a number of established stereotypical characters. Their performances utilised [[mime]], music and [[acrobatics]]. The Aláàrìnjó tradition influenced the popular traveling theatre, which was the most prevalent and highly developed form of theatre in [[Nigeria]] from the 1950s to the 1980s. In the 1990s, the popular traveling theatre moved into television and film and now gives live performances only rarely.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 88–89).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Total theatre" also developed in Nigeria in the 1950s. It utilised non-Naturalistic techniques, [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] physical imagery, and exercised a flexibile use of language. Playwrights writing in the mid-1970s made use of some of these techniques, but articulated them with "a radical appreciation of the problems of society."&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 70).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional performance modes have strongly influenced the major figures in contemporary Nigerian theatre. The work of [[Hubert Ogunde]] (sometimes referred to as the "father of contemporary Yoruban theatre") was informed by the Aláàrìnjó tradition and Egungun masquerades.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 76).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wole Soyinka]], who is "generally recognized as Africa's greatest living playwright", gives the divinity Ogun a complex [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] significance in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Hill, and Woodyard (2005, 69).&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "The Fourth Stage" (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Soyinka (1973, 120).&lt;/ref&gt; Soyinka contrasts Yoruba drama with [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical Athenian drama]], relating both to the 19th-century German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s analysis of the latter in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Ogun, he argues, is "a totality of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian, Apollonian]] and [[Prometheus|Promethean]] virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Soyinka (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents of the travelling theatre in Nigeria include [[Duro Ladipo]] and [[Moses Olaiya]] (a popular comic act). These practitioners contributed much to the field of African theatre during the period of mixture and experimentation of the indigenous with the Western theatre.

===African-American theatre===
The history of African-American theatre has a dual origin. The first is rooted in local theatre where African Americans performed in cabins and parks. Their performances (folk tales, songs, music, and dance) were rooted in the African culture before being influenced by the American environment. [[African Grove Theatre]] was the first African-American theatre established in 1821 by William Henry Brown {{ISBN|0521465850}}

==Asian theatre==

===Indian theatre===

====Overview of Indian theatre====
{{Main article|Theatre in India}}
The earliest form of [[India]]n theatre was the [[Sanskrit drama|Sanskrit theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt;  It emerged sometime between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century and flourished between the 1st century and the 10th, which was a period of relative peace in the [[history of India]] during which hundreds of plays were written.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 70) and Richmond (1995, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquests]] that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72) and Richmond (1995, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1997, 72), Richmond (1995, 516), and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Indian theatre developed during the [[British Raj|period of colonial rule]] under the [[British Empire]], from the mid-19th century until the mid-20th.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1995, 516) and Richmond, Swann, and Zarrilli (1993, 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sanskrit theatre ====
{{Main article|Sanskrit drama}}
{{See also|Koodiyattam}}
The earliest-surviving fragments of [[Sanskrit drama]] date from the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1995, 516–517).&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth of archaeological evidence from earlier periods offers no indication of the existence of a tradition of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 516"&gt;Richmond (1995, 516).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Vedas]]'' (the earliest Indian literature, from between 1500 and 600 BC) contain no hint of it; although a small number of hymns are composed in a form of [[dialogue]]), the [[ritual]]s of the [[Vedic period]] do not appear to have developed into theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 516"/&gt; The ''[[Mahābhāṣya]]'' by [[Patañjali]] contains the earliest reference to what may have been the seeds of Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 517"&gt;Richmond (1995, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise on [[grammar]] from 140 BC provides a feasible date for the beginnings of [[theatre in India]].&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 517"/&gt;

However, although there are no surviving fragments of any drama prior to this date, it is possible that early Buddhist literature provides the earliest evidence for the existence of Indian theatre. The [[Pali]] [[Sutta Pitaka|suttas]] (ranging in date from the 5th to 3rd centuries BCE) refer to the existence of troupes of actors (led by a chief actor), who performed dramas on a stage. It is indicated that these dramas incorporated dance, but were listed as a distinct form of performance, alongside dancing, singing, and story recitations.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Van M. Baumer and James R. Brandon (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix-RShGgZUAC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=actor+drama+pali#v=onepage&amp;q=actor%20drama%20pali&amp;f=false ''Sanskrit Drama in Performance''] (University of Hawaii Press, 1981), pp.11&lt;/ref&gt; (According to later Buddhist texts, King [[Bimbisara]], a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]], had a drama performed for another king. This would be as early as the 5th century BCE, but the event is only described in much later texts, from the 3rd-4th centuries CE.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix-RShGgZUAC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=actor+drama+pali#v=onepage&amp;q=actor%20drama%20pali&amp;f=false ''Sanskrit Drama in Performance''], p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The major source of evidence for Sanskrit theatre is ''[[Natyashastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' (''Nātyaśāstra''), a compendium whose date of composition is uncertain (estimates range from 200 BC to 200 AD) and whose authorship is attributed to [[Bharata Muni]]. The ''Treatise'' is the most complete work of dramaturgy in the ancient world. It addresses [[acting]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[Dramaturgy|dramatic construction]], [[Theatre architecture|architecture]], [[Costume design|costuming]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], [[Theatrical properties|props]], the organisation of companies, the audience, competitions, and offers a [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] account of the origin of theatre.&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 517"/&gt; In doing so, it provides indications about the nature of actual theatrical practices. Sanskrit theatre was performed on sacred ground by priests who had been trained in the necessary skills (dance, music, and recitation) in a [hereditary process]. Its aim was both to educate and to entertain.

Under the patronage of royal courts, performers belonged to professional companies that were directed by a stage manager (''sutradhara''), who may also have acted.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii) and Richmond (1995, 517).&lt;/ref&gt; This task was thought of as being analogous to that of a [[Puppetry|puppeteer]]—the literal meaning of "''sutradhara''" is "holder of the strings or threads".&lt;ref name="Richmond 1995, 517"/&gt; The performers were trained rigorously in vocal and physical technique.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1995, 518).&lt;/ref&gt; There were no prohibitions against female performers; companies were all-male, all-female, and of mixed gender. Certain sentiments were considered inappropriate for men to enact, however, and were thought better suited to women. Some performers played character their own age, while others played those different from their own (whether younger or older). Of all the elements of theatre, the ''Treatise'' gives most attention to acting (''abhinaya''), which consists of two styles: realistic (''lokadharmi'') and conventional (''natyadharmi''), though the major focus is on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond (1995, 518). The literal meaning of ''abhinaya'' is "to carry forwards".&lt;/ref&gt;

Its drama is regarded as the highest achievement of [[Sanskrit literature]].&lt;ref name="Brandon 1981, xvii"&gt;Brandon (1981, xvii).&lt;/ref&gt; It utilised [[stock character]]s, such as the hero (''nayaka''), heroine (''nayika''), or clown (''vidusaka''). Actors may have specialised in a particular type. [[Kālidāsa]] in the 1st century BC, is arguably considered to be ancient [[India]]'s greatest Sanskrit dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'' (''Mālavikā and Agnimitra''), ''[[Vikramuurvashiiya]]'' (''Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi''), and ''[[The Recognition of Sakuntala|Abhijñānaśākuntala]]'' (''The Recognition of Shakuntala''). The last was inspired by a story in the ''Mahabharata'' and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam|Śakuntalā]]'' (in English translation) influenced [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' (1808–1832).&lt;ref name="Brandon 1981, xvii"/&gt;

The next great Indian dramatist was [[Bhavabhuti]] (c. 7th century). He is said to have written the following three plays: ''Malati-Madhava'', ''Mahaviracharita'' and ''Uttar Ramacharita''. Among these three, the last two cover between them the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''.

====Kathakali====
{{Main article|Kathakali}}
[[Kathakali]] is a highly stylised classical [[India]]n [[dance]]-[[drama]] noted for the attractive make-up of characters, elaborate costumes, detailed gestures, and well-defined body movements presented in tune with the anchor playback music and complementary percussion. It originated in the country's present-day state of [[Kerala]] during the 17th century&lt;ref&gt;Zarrilli (1984&lt;!-- PAGE NUMBER OF THIS QUOTATION? --&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; and has developed over the years with improved looks, refined gestures and added themes besides more ornate singing and precise drumming.

====Modern Indian theatre====
[[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a pioneering modern playwright who wrote plays noted for their exploration and questioning of nationalism, identity, spiritualism and material greed.&lt;ref name="Banham 1995, 1051"&gt;Banham (1995, 1051).&lt;/ref&gt; His plays are written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and include ''Chitra'' (''Chitrangada'', 1892), ''The King of the Dark Chamber'' (''Raja'', 1910), ''[[The Post Office (play)|The Post Office]]'' (''Dakghar'', 1913), and ''Red Oleander'' (''Raktakarabi'', 1924).&lt;ref name="Banham 1995, 1051"/&gt;

===Chinese theatre===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
{{Main article|Theatre of China}}

====Shang theatre====
There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as 1500 BC during the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved music, clowning and acrobatic displays.

====Han and Tang theatre====
During the Han Dynasty, shadow puppetry first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Cantonese southern and Pekingese northern. The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather usually taken from the belly of a donkey. They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the 11th century before becoming a tool of the government.

The Tang Dynasty is sometimes known as 'The Age of 1000 Entertainments'. During this era, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China|Emperor Xuanzong]] formed an acting school known as the Children of the [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical.

====Song and Yuan theatre====
{{further information|Zaju}}
In the [[Song dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving [[acrobatic]]s and [[music]]. These developed in the [[Yuan dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form with a four- or five-act structure.

Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.

===Philippine theatre===
During the 333-year reign of the Spanish government, they introduced into the islands the Catholic religion and the Spanish way of life, which gradually merged with the indigenous culture to form the “lowland folk culture” now shared by the major ethnolinguistic groups. 
Today, the dramatic forms introduced or influenced by Spain continue to live in rural areas all over the archipelago. These forms include the komedya, the playlets, the sinakulo, the sarswela, and the drama. In recent years, some of these forms have been revitalized to make them more responsive to the conditions and needs of a developing nation.

===Thai theatre===
{{Further information|Ramakien}}
In [[Thailand]], it has been a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand's national epic ''[[Ramakien]]'', a version of the Indian ''[[Ramayana]]'', remains popular in Thailand even today.

===Khmer and Malay theatre===
In [[Cambodia]], at the ancient capital [[Angkor Wat]], stories from the Indian epics ''Ramayana'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces. Similar reliefs are found at [[Borobudur]] in [[Indonesia]].

===Japanese theatre===
{{further information|Theatre of Japan}}

====Noh====
{{Main article|Noh}}
During the 14th century, there were small companies of actors in Japan who performed short, sometimes vulgar comedies. A director of one of these companies, Kan'ami (1333–1384), had a son, [[Zeami Motokiyo]] (1363–1443) who was considered one of the finest child actors in Japan. When Kan'ami's company performed for [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] (1358–1408), the Shōgun of Japan, he implored Zeami to have a court education for his arts. After Zeami succeeded his father, he continued to perform and adapt his style into what is today [[Noh]]. A mixture of [[pantomime]] and vocal acrobatics, this style has fascinated the Japanese for hundreds of years.

====Bunraku====
{{Main article|Bunraku}}
Japan, after a long period of civil wars and political disarray, was unified and at peace primarily due to shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616). However, alarmed at increasing Christian growth, he cut off contact from Japan to Europe and China and outlawed Christianity. When peace did come, a flourish of cultural influence and growing merchant class demanded its own entertainment. The first form of theatre to flourish was Ningyō jōruri (commonly referred to as [[Bunraku]]). The founder of and main contributor to Ningyō jōruri, [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653–1725), turned his form of theatre into a true art form. Ningyō jōruri is a highly stylized form of theatre using puppets, today about 1/3d the size of a human. The men who control the puppets train their entire lives to become master puppeteers, when they can then operate the puppet's head and right arm and choose to show their faces during the performance. The other puppeteers, controlling the less important limbs of the puppet, cover themselves and their faces in a black suit, to imply their invisibility. The dialogue is handled by a single person, who uses varied tones of voice and speaking manners to simulate different characters. Chikamatsu wrote thousands of plays during his career, most of which are still used today. They wore masks instead of elaborate makeup. Masks define their gender, personality, and moods the actor is in.

====Kabuki====
{{Main article|Kabuki}}
Kabuki began shortly after Bunraku, legend has it by an actress named Okuni, who lived around the end of the 16th century. Most of Kabuki's material came from Nõ and Bunraku, and its erratic dance-type movements are also an effect of Bunraku. However, Kabuki is less formal and more distant than Nõ, yet very popular among the Japanese public. Actors are trained in many varied things including dancing, singing, pantomime, and even acrobatics. Kabuki was first performed by young girls, then by young boys, and by the end of the 16th century, Kabuki companies consisted of all men. The men who portrayed women on stage were specifically trained to elicit the essence of a woman in their subtle movements and gestures.

====Butoh====
[[File:Gyohei Zaitsu Butoh.jpg|thumb|Gyohei Zaitsu performing [[Butoh]]]]
{{Main article|Butoh}}
[[Butoh]] is the collective name for a diverse range of activities, techniques and motivations for [[dance]], performance, or movement inspired by the {{nihongo|'''Ankoku-Butoh'''|[[wikt:暗黒|暗黒]]舞踏|ankoku butō|extra1=roughly, "dark steps"}} movement. It typically involves playful and grotesque imagery, taboo topics, extreme or absurd environments, and is traditionally performed in white body makeup with slow hyper-controlled motion, with or without an audience.  There is no set style, and it may be purely conceptual with no movement at all. Its origins have been attributed to Japanese dance legends [[Tatsumi Hijikata]] and [[Kazuo Ohno]]. Butoh appeared first in Japan following [[World War II]] and specifically after [[student riot]]s. The roles of [[authority]] were now subject to challenge and subversion. It also appeared as a reaction against the contemporary dance scene in Japan, which Hijikata felt was based on the one hand on imitating the West and on the other on imitating the [[Noh]]. He critiqued the current state of dance as overly superficial.

=== Persian theatre ===
{{Main article|Persian theatre}}
====Medieval Islamic theatre====
The most popular forms of theatre in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] were [[Puppetry|puppet theatre]] (which included [[Puppet|hand puppets]], [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live [[passion play]]s known as ''[[Ta'zieh|ta'ziya]]'', in which actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic plays revolved around the ''[[shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Secular plays known as ''akhraja'' were recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Moreh (1986, 565–601).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mughal-era Kos Minar in the Delhi National Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|Kos Minar in the [[National Zoological Park Delhi]]]]
[[File:By-ibneazhar-aik-kos-monument-lahore-pakistan-1 15978367131 o 20.jpg|thumb|upright|Kos Minar built with [[lakhori bricks]] near the [[Tomb of Ali Mardan Khan]] in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].]]
The '''Kos Minars''' ({{Lang-fa|کوس مینار}}) (Translated: ''Mile Pillars'') are medieval milestones along the [[Grand Trunk Road]] in northern [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], and [[Pakistan]], that were made by the 16th-century [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] Ruler [[Sher Shah Suri]]. Kos Minars were erected to serve as markers of distance along royal routes from [[Agra]] to [[Ajmer]], Agra to [[Lahore]], and from Agra to [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]] in the south. 

==History==
[[Kos (unit)|Kos]], one fourth of a [[Yojana]],&lt;ref name=Arthashashtra&gt;[https://archive.org/details/Arthasastra_English_Translation Arthashastra, Chanakya, 4th century BCE, pp151]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2007}} {{cite web|url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net/aranya/sarga69/aranyaitrans69.htm#Verse5|accessdate=2007-09-29|title=Valmiki Ramayana / Book III: Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek / Chapter (Sarga) 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an ancient [[India]]n unit of distance. It can represent either a distance of approximately {{convert|1.8|km}} or {{convert|3.2|km}}. [[Minaret|Minar]] is a Persian word for tower. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]] recorded in ''[[Akbar Nama]]'' that in the year 1575 AD, [[Akbar]] issued an order that at every Kos on the way from Agra to Ajmer, a pillar or a minar should be erected for the comfort of the travelers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ualberta.ca/~rnoor/minar_kos.html Kos Minar] University of Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = A milestone on the highway | newspaper=Hindustan Times| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/A-milestone-on-the-highway/Article1-951130.aspx| first= Nivedita | last=Khandekar| date = 27 October 2012| accessdate = 20 March 2018 | deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130923040501/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/A-milestone-on-the-highway/Article1-951130.aspx| archivedate = 23 September 2013| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from these, many [[caravanserais]] (roadside inns) were also built for the tired and weary travelers.

==Characteristics==
Kos Minars are solid round pillars, around {{convert|30|ft}} in height that stands on a masonry platform built with bricks and plastered over with lime. They were not built in a standardized style. Being milestones, they were an important part of communication and travel in a large empire.

==Later additions==
Kos Minars became an institution during the rule of the Mughals that Emperor [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]],following in their predecessors footsteps added to the existing network of Kos Minars. In the north they were extended as far as [[Peshawar]] and in the east to [[Bengal]] via [[Kannauj]]. The geographic span makes for nearly three thousand kilometers of Mughal highways, accounting for nearly 1000 Kos Minars, i.e., 1 every Kos or {{convert|3|km}}. There is no record as to how many of them have survived.

==Preserved monuments==
Over the years these road monuments have gone into a state of disrepair and are almost lost in obscurity. Along India's old highways, particularly the [[Grand Trunk Road]], one still finds Kos Minars.
According to a report of the [[Archaeology Survey of India]], there are 49 Kos Minars in [[Haryana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Signposts lost in history |publisher=The Sunday Tribune| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060910/spectrum/main2.htm|date= 10 September 2006 |accessdate = 2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also five Kos Minars around [[Ludhiana]] city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Monumental' treasure house |publisher=The Times of India| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-12/ludhiana/28193174_1_archaeologists-city-bus-monuments |date=12 Jul 2009| accessdate = 2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Of late some of these Minars have been restored and attempts for preserving many others are ongoing.

There is a preserved Kos Minar in [[Lahore]], near the [[tomb]] of [[Ali Mardan Khan]]. It probably lined the original Grand Trunk Road, a few hundred meters north of it.

'''Nightwolf''' is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Mortal Kombat (series)|Mortal Kombat]]'' fighting game series. He debuted in ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Shamanism|shaman]] and [[historian]] who is chosen as a warrior of Earthrealm during [[Shao Kahn]]'s invasion. As one of the main characters, he was also featured in the game's companion media, such as the live action film ''[[Mortal Kombat Annihilation]]'' and the animated series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]''.

He is also playable in the updates ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]''. After being absent from ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'', he reemerged as a player character in 2004's ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'' and also appeared in the follow-ups ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' and the 2011 [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'' reboot]]. Response to the character has been mixed, with some citing Nightwolf as an example of a Native American stereotype.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Although introduced as a historian and a shaman, Nightwolf does not live in the past. He is a proud and fierce warrior dedicated to the cause of good, and is in contact with [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] through visions. As such, he draws both on internal and external spiritual energy to enhance his strength. Although his patch of tribal land provided a vital shelter territory for the Earthrealm warriors at the time of [[Shao Kahn]]'s invasion, it seems Nightwolf prefers solitary work to companionship. Nightwolf had been warned of the coming invasion of Earthrealm by a vision from Raiden. As such, he was fully aware and prepared for the events as they occurred, including the attacks of Kahn's extermination squads. His own homeland protected through shamanic magic, he would soon be joined by the other chosen warriors. Together, they then travelled back to the East Coast, prepared for battle against the Emperor and his minions, and won.

Nightwolf made his return during the events of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]''. In the events leading to ''Deception'', Nightwolf viewed images of the [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Onaga|Dragon King]] and his resurrection in his dreams. These nightmares recurred constantly, and Nightwolf came to recognize them as a warning. He knew that a new evil threat was about to arise from the ashes, and in view of [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]]'s transformation into [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Onaga|Onaga]], his predictions most assuredly came true. The method that Nightwolf would use to destroy Onaga was one passed down to him by his forefathers. This method was that of the "Sin Eater", which involved absorbing the sins of his tribe. However, there was a terrible consequence to be considered in taking on such a role. If he were to do this, he would be a danger to all that surrounded him, including his allies. Hence, he made the decision to destroy Onaga on his own, keeping his allies out of harm's way. His role as a Sin Eater would involve entering the Netherealm, drawing Onaga's soul to him, and releasing the absorbed sins of his ancestors, which would bind Onaga to the spot. His method was successful and he managed to separate Reptile from Onaga, and bind the Dragon King to the Netherealm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/02/01/who-actually-won-mortal-kombat.aspx?PostPageIndex=3&amp;PageIndex=7 |title=Who Actually Won Mortal Kombat? - Features |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his quest, he was guided back to Earthrealm by his spirit guides - a pack of wolves. Nightwolf began to receive visions of a battle, where an unknown power was forcing the participating warriors to fight each other. His visions started to become reality, when he spoke with [[Johnny Cage]] and their allies, and agreed to assist them in battle against [[Shinnok]] and his forces. Eventually, Nightwolf was met by [[Kitana]] and the spirit of [[Liu Kang]]. The bond that the two of them shared was enough for Kitana to keep Kang's spirit whole, until a way was found for him to rejoin with his body. Still drained after using his shamanic powers on Onaga, Nightwolf used what magic he could to relieve Kitana of her burden, and took on the responsibility of looking after Kang's spirit.&lt;ref name="MKAbio"&gt;[http://mkarmageddon.com/assets/bios/bio_nightwolf.html Nightwolf's ''Armageddon'' bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116044523/http://mkarmageddon.com/assets/bios/bio_nightwolf.html |date=January 16, 2009 }}. Official ''Mortal Kombat Armageddon'' website. Retrieved on 2007-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Armageddon'' ending, he defeats Blaze, allowing him to absorb his power. Nightwolf is catapulted into the spirit world, where he becomes the ultimate shaman, a living ghost. He finds Liu Kang's spirit and guides it back to the physical world. There, Liu Kang is able to reunite with his body, becoming human once more.&lt;ref name="MKAend"&gt;[http://mortalkombatwarehouse.com/mka/nightwolf/ Nightwolf's ''Armageddon'' info] at Mortal Kombat Warehouse&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 reboot, Nightwolf is part of the first Mortal Kombat tournament, defeated by Scorpion, although he and Raiden attempt to appeal to his conscience. He is in an unknown location during the second tournament, and does not join his compatriots as they congratulate Liu Kang in Earthrealm for defeating Goro and Shang Tsung. He returns during Outworld's invastion, recruiting Stryker after he defeats Ermac. He appears to be Raiden's second-in-command. Most importantly, Nightwolf is responsible for destroying Shao Kahn's Soulnado and is one of the few Earthrealm warriors to survive [[Sindel]]'s initial onslaught. Ultimately, Nightwolf sacrifices himself to destroy Sindel in a powerful burst of disintegrating light, resulting in his soul being among those claimed by [[Quan Chi]]. Nightwolf, a Revenant of [[Quan Chi]], is present during the events of ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'', although he is given no lines, is unplayable and plays a negligible role in the story.

====Design and gameplay====
During an early development of ''Mortal Kombat 3'', the character was known simply as "Indian" before his name was determined. [[Ed Boon]] described him to ''[[Tips and Tricks|VideoGames]]'' magazine in April 1995 (issue #75) as "a very nontraditional Indian. He doesn't swing an axe that he's always holding, like [[Chief Thunder]] from ''[[Killer Instinct (video game series)|Killer Instinct]]''. He doesn't have all of the stereotypical Indian-type things like [[T. Hawk]] or Chief Thunder; he doesn't go 'Hoya! Hoya!' and all that."&lt;ref&gt;''VideoGames: The Ultimate Gaming Magazine'' #75 (April 1995), page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Nightwolf uses a mystical set of weapons (a [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] and a bow and arrow) in battle.

According to guides by both ''[[Mean Machines Sega]]'' and ''SuperGamePower'', the best part about him in the original ''MK3'' was his then-unique ability to deflect any projectile back towards an opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/mean-machines-sega-magazine-37/MMSega_37_Nov_1995#page/n85/mode/1up/ |title=Mean Machines Sega Magazine Issue 37 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/SuperGamePower_Especial_No._01_1996-12_Nova_Cultural_BR_pt#page/n19/mode/1up/ |title=SuperGamePower Especial - No. 01 (1996-12) |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Total 64'' opined that, once mastered, Nightwolf "is one of the brightest stars" of ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'', as "none of his moves are seemingly useful at the start, but stick[ing] with him [might] get some great results."&lt;ref&gt;''Total 64'' 2/97, page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prima Games]]' official guide for ''Armageddon'' gave Nightwolf a poor overall rating of 4/10, stating: "Nightwolf is a punishing character type, but he is almost forced to punish using ranged attacks. Unfortunately this means that Nightwolf, while being a solid punisher character, has a difficult time inflicting heavy damage on opponents."&lt;ref name=prima&gt;Bryan Dawson, ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (Prima Official Game Guide)'', Prima Games 2006 (p. 221–224).&lt;/ref&gt; In Prima Games' official guide for the 2011's ''Mortal Kombat'', Nightwolf was judged to be a much improved character, especially since his player "can play the aggressor or the defensive force based on the fact that his Shoulder and Power Charge moves knock down and are instantaneous" if the former is blocked; his Uppercut is also "an excellent move to counter jumpers." Nightwolf's best matchup is against Reptile, and one of the only few characters that will give him serious problems is [[Noob Saibot]].&lt;ref&gt;Jason Wilson, Adam Hernandez, ''Mortal Kombat: Prima Official Game Guide'', Prima Games 2011 (p. 165).&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other media and merchandise===
[[File:MKA Nightwolf.png|thumb|[[Litefoot]] as Nightwolf in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|Annihilation]]''|alt=|left]]

In the 1996 cartoon series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', Nightwolf (voiced by Tod Thawley) serves to offer both spiritual and technical help to the Earthrealm warriors, having experience with computer technology. He only fights a few times, spending most of his time back at base monitoring the Earthrealm looking for dimensional rips. Nightwolf has a pet wolf named Kiba, who could merge with Nightwolf to increase his power.

Nightwolf briefly appeared in the 1997 live-action film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', played by Native American [[Hip hop music|rapper]] and actor [[Litefoot]]. Nightwolf has no fight scenes, although he attacks Liu Kang in his wolf form and strikes him unconscious with a [[hatchet]] in order to put him in a "dream state," during which he is shown sitting at a campfire in Liu's dream and teaching him how to use his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Animality|Animality]]. Nightwolf was described in the [[shooting script]] and movie novelization as wearing a [[Stone Temple Pilots]] T-shirt and a pair of [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]] sunglasses, which was ultimately aborted in favor of his in-game outfit.

Nightwolf has since featured in no other ''MK'' alternate media, but stunt coordinator Larnell Stovall said in a 2011 interview with ShogunGamer that he had wanted the character for the 2013 second season of the ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'' web series, describing him as "too cool due to his powers, knives and that axe!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shogungamer.com/news/exclusive-interview-larnell-stovall-mortal-kombat-legacy |title=Exclusive Interview With Larnell Stovall (Mortal Kombat: Legacy) |publisher=Shogungamer.com |accessdate=2011-05-19 |date=May 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An action figure of Nightwolf was released by Jazwares in July 2012. It came in two versions, 4-inch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Kombat-4-Inch-Nightwolf-Action/dp/B007Z7QV4U/ |title=Mortal Kombat 9 4-Inch Nightwolf Action Figure : Toys &amp; Games |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6-inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Nightwolf-Mortal-Kombat-6-Inch-Action/dp/B007Z7R0K4/ |title=Nightwolf Mortal Kombat 9 6-Inch Action Figure : Toy Figures : Toys &amp; Games |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2014-02-12 |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Ethnic representation===
Nightwolf has often been unfavorably discussed in the context of the portrayal of Native Americans in video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Native Resolution |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_184/5652-Native-Resolution.4 |title=The Escapist: Native Resolution |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boon's 1995 description of the character to ''VideoGames'' provoked a comment from the magazine: "For a character described by Midway as a 'nontraditional Indian,' he certainly has all the trappings of one. Let's see, he wears feathers and [[Body painting|war paint]], swings a hatchet, shoots arrows...could there be a '[[Scalping|Scalp]]' Fatality?"&lt;ref&gt;''VideoGames: The Ultimate Gaming Magazine'' #77 (June 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[CollegeHumor|Dorkly]] included Nightwolf among their selections of the seven most stereotypical Native American fighting-game characters. "Instead of carrying around actual axes, Nightwolf is so in touch with spirits and elders and, you know, energy, that he can form tomahawks out of green [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Owen Parsons and Jeff Rubin|url=http://www.dorkly.com/post/15651/the-7-most-stereotypical-native-americans-in-fighting-game-history/page:3 |title=The Dorklyst: The 7 Most Stereotypical Native American Characters in Fighting Game History |publisher=Dorkly |date= May 12, 2011|accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', in 2012, deemed Nightwolf the top stereotypical character in all video games, describing him as "the epitome of every red-skinned, feather-wearing sports mascot and old cowboy movie [[Serial film|serial]] ... [he] has warpaint on his face, a feather in his hair and the sleeveless vest as if [[Geronimo]] himself just gave it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/05/the-15-most-stereotypical-characters-in-video-games/nightwolf-mortal-kombat |title=The 15 Most Stereotypical Characters In Video Games|first=Chad|last=Hunter|publisher=Complex.com|date=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Wong of ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' included Nightwolf as an example of an ethnically-stereotypical game character in a 2012 feature about racial prejudices in video game design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=David |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19922_5-prejudices-that-video-games-cant-seem-to-get-over_p2.html |title=5 Prejudices That Video Games Can't Seem to Get Over |publisher=Cracked.com |date=2012-07-18 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardcore Gaming 101 said of the character's role in the ''Mortal Kombat'' series, "In the mid-'90s, it was practically an unwritten law that every fighting game had to have either a Bruce Lee clone, [or] a Native American ... Nightwolf takes up the latter slot."&lt;ref name="HG101"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/mortalkombat/mortalkombat.htm|title=Hardcore Gaming 101: Mortal Kombat—Characters|first=Robert|last=Naytor|date=March 2013 |accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was concurred by Gavin Jasper of [[Dennis Publishing|Den of Geek]]: "He seemed to be there [in ''MK3''] because throwing a Native American into your fighting game series was the in-thing to do back in the '90s."&lt;ref name="denofgeek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/games/mortal-kombat/243041/mortal-kombat-ranking-all-the-characters/page/0/1|title=Mortal Kombat: Ranking All the Characters|first=Gavin|last=Jasper|publisher=Den of Geek|date=January 30, 2015|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 feature on Native American stereotyping in video games, [[GamesRadar]] exemplified Nightwolf for the "Warrior" trope. "[W]hile this pro-Indian sentiment is certainly heartwarming, much of Nightwolf’s character is wide of the mark." The site added that the act of "sin-eating" (his role in ''Deception'') was actually European in origin, and criticized his Animality in ''MK3'' as being "for gratuitous shock value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-native-american-stereotypes/?page=2 |title=The Top 7… Native American stereotypes |first=Joe|last=McNeilly|publisher= GamesRadar |date=November 24, 2008|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Topless Robot]] said, "Nightwolf’s design and backstory are standard-issue for Native American characters in fighting games ... [but] his look is actually less stereotypical than, say, Chief Thunder’s from ''Killer Instinct.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2008/04/the_10_most_ridiculously_stereotyped_fighting_game.php|title=The 10 Most Ridiculously Stereotyped Fighting Game Characters|first=Rob|last=Bricken|publisher=Topless Robot|date=April 30, 2008|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric "Woodyman" Vole of [[ScrewAttack]] offered a positive reaction by naming Nightwolf fourth in his 2011 ranking of the top eleven Native American game characters. "I was never a huge fan of Nightwolf in the older Mortal Kombat games...but that all changed from his appearance in ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|MK9]].''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.screwattack.com/news/top-11-native-americans-gaming|title=Top 11 Native Americans in Gaming |author=Woodyman (Eric Vole)|publisher=ScrewAttack|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other reception===
The character's presence in the 2011 reboot was better received. [[UGO Networks|UGO]] ranked him 20th in their 2012 list of the top fifty series characters. "Nightwolf uses the magic of the shaman to ward off evil-doers and to bring peace to the realms...by kicking everyone's ass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/mortal-kombat-characters?page=4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929141220/http://www.ugo.com/games/mortal-kombat-characters?page=4|archivedate=2012-09-29 |title=Top 11 Mortal Kombat Characters |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans voted him the series' 28th-best character in a 2013 online poll hosted by Dorkly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorkly.com/toplist/56586/the-greatest-mortal-kombat-character-of-all-time |title=The Greatest Mortal Kombat Character of All-Time (Vote Now!) - Dorkly Toplist |publisher=Dorkly.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Den of Geek placed Nightwolf 51st in their 2015 ranking of the ''MK'' franchise's 73 playable characters, calling him "the most ho-hum member of the ''Mortal Kombat 3'' cast," yet lauding him for killing Sindel in the ''MK2011'' story mode "when she went all [[John Cena]]" on the Earthrealm defenders.&lt;ref name="denofgeek"/&gt; ''Complex'' ranked him among the ''MK'' series' most underrated characters, stating that "the fact that he can transform into a wolf and maul you to death should tell you he's nothing to play with."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complex.com/video-games/2011/04/10-most-underrated-mk-kombatants/nightwolf The 10 Most Underrated "Mortal Kombat" Kombatants], Complex.com, Apr 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[Game Informer]]'' unfavorably compared the "uninspiring" then-new ''[[Soulcalibur V]]'' character Z.W.E.I. to Nightwolf in that he "summons a spirit wolf, and his move set is more annoying than practical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/blogs/members/b/champ_frosty_blog/archive/2012/01/31/soulcalibur-v-review.aspx |title=SoulCalibur V Review - Champ_Frosty Blog |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2012-01-31 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His "Ascension" Fatality from ''MK2011'' was ranked ninth in ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'s'' selection of the reboot's top nine Fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan Spicer |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2011/04/best-fatalities-from-mortal-kombat-1-and-9.html |title=The 17 Best Fatalities from Mortal Kombat 1 &amp; 9 :: Blogs :: List of the Day :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date=2011-04-23 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his Fatalities were included in WhatCulture's 2015 ranking of the "10 Worst Fatalities in Mortal Kombat History" for what the site considered their lack of originality, with his finisher from ''Mortal Kombat: Deception,'' where he throws a single tomahawk into his opponent's head, in the fifth spot, and his "A Little Off the Top" from ''MK2011'', in which he again embeds one tomahawk in his opponent's head before decapitating them with the second, at number two. "Seriously, Nightwolf?! What is WRONG with you? You’re bringing this weak nonsense back to the party?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/gaming/10-worst-fatalities-in-mortal-kombat-history.php/10|title=10 Worst Fatalities in Mortal Kombat History|first=Adam|last=Blampied|publisher=WhatCulture.com|date=May 6, 2015|accessdate=May 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As was the case with most of the cast of characters in ''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation'', Nightwolf's appearance was critically panned. [[Newsarama]] dismissed him as "useless,"&lt;ref name="newsarama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/5350-the-all-time-best-and-worst-video-game-movies.html|title=The All-Time Best and Worst VIDEO GAME Movies|publisher=Newsarama.com|first=Seth|last=Robison|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maitland McDonagh of [[TV Guide]] called the character "dopey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/mortal-kombat-annihilation-132242/review/|title=Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|first=Maitland|last=McDonagh|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Snider of Film.com said of his opening dialogue exchange with Liu Kang, "I couldn’t hear the rest because my brain was exploding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/movies/erics-bad-movies-mortal-kombat-annihilation-1997|title=Eric's Bad Movies: Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|first=Eric D.|last=Snider|publisher=Film.com|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=February 15, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216102540/http://www.film.com/movies/erics-bad-movies-mortal-kombat-annihilation-1997|archivedate=February 16, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 411Mania called his tutelage of Liu Kang "hippie Native American [[Yoda]] spiel."&lt;ref name="411mania"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/movies/columns/9879/Misunderstood-Masterpieces:-Mortal-Kombat:-Annihilation.htm|title=Misunderstood Masterpieces: ''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation''|first=Will|last=Helm|publisher=411mania.com|date=May 3, 2005|accessdate=December 21, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826172707/http://www.411mania.com/movies/columns/9879/Misunderstood-Masterpieces:-Mortal-Kombat:-Annihilation.htm|archivedate=August 26, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Coyle of Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension included Nightwolf among the film's "shallow, one-shot characters that serve little or no purpose."&lt;ref name="jabootu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jabootu.net/?p=610|title=Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)|publisher=Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension|date=July 3, 2004|accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kate Willaert of ''Game Informer'' sardonically remarked, "Nightwolf delivers the best line in the movie when he tells Liu Kang he must test his courage, and find his Animality. ... As a result, the film's final climactic battle turns into ''[[Primal Rage]]: The Movie.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/blogs/members/b/critical_kate_blog/archive/2013/01/05/31-31-the-movie-part-5-mortal-kombat-annihilation-1997.aspx|title=31/31: The Movie Part 5: Mortal Kombat Annihilation (1997) |first=Kate|last=Willaert|publisher=Game Informer|date=January 5, 2013|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Io9]]'s Alasdair Wilkins said of the character's depiction in the film, in particular the scene of Nightwolf knocking out Liu Kang with the hatchet, "Nightwolf isn't just a magical shapeshifting shaman who only exists to show the hero his destiny...he's also kind of an asshole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5803280/the-scenes-that-prove-mortal-kombat-annihilation-is-the-singularity-of-stupid/|title=These clips prove Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is the singularity of stupid|first=Alasdair|last=Wilkins|publisher=io9.com|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Doug Skiles of KillerMovies said in his 1997 review, "The only person putting forth anything resembling effort is Litefoot, who plays Nightwolf, at least for the whopping two minutes that he's on the screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killermovies.com/m/mortalkombattheannihilation/reviews/5mz.html|title=Mortal Kombat: The Annihilation Review|first=Doug|last=Skiles|publisher=KillerMovies.com|date=November 24, 1997|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1359">'''Peter Tudebode''' was a [[Poitou|Poitevin]] priest who was part of the [[First Crusade]] as part of the [[army of Raymond of Saint-Gilles]]. He wrote an account of the crusade, ''Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere'', including an eye-witness account of the [[Siege of Antioch]], edited in volume 155 of the [[Patrologia Latina]].

The anonymous [[Gesta Francorum]] is often assumed to be derived from Tudebode's account, but Rubenstein (2005) suggests that both derive from a lost common source.

The '''Photothèque''' (officially '''Photothèque de la Ville de Luxembourg''') in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg City]] in the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] houses several large collections of photographs of the city taken between 1855 and today.&lt;ref name="vdl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALBAD"/&gt; Open to the public, it is modelled on the photothèque at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris and has adopted the same classification system.

==History==

The Photothèque was opened in 1984 in order to display photographic collections previously stored in the municipal archives. Its objective was to provide a permanent showcase for photographs documenting the look of the city over the various periods of its urban development.&lt;ref name="vdl"&gt;[http://www.vdl.lu/phototheque.html "Photothèque", ''Ville de Luxembourg'']. {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 22 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Its design, equipment and method of operation were based on experience in France, specifically from [[Documentation française]] and the ''photothèque'' at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]]. After operating for a period as part of the city's binding department at 63, rue du Fort Neipperg, in 1992 the increasingly popular Photothèque moved into specially built premises at the Cloche d'Or in the south of Luxembourg City.&lt;ref name="Fielder"/&gt;

The holdings acquired in 1985 are still considered the most important. They consist of Bernard Wolff's collection with historic views taken by various photographers during the final period of Luxembourg's fortifications, [[Batty Fischer]]'s collection of photographs documenting the city's development in the 19th and 20th centuries, and a series of originals taken by Luxembourg-born photographer [[Edward Steichen]].&lt;ref name="Fielder"/&gt;

==Location==
Situated at 10, rue Eugène Ruppert, in the Cloche d'Or district of Luxembourg City, the Photothèque is open to the public on weekdays.&lt;ref name="vdl"/&gt;

==Collections==
[[File:Brandebourg brasserie Clausen 1865.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pierre Brandebourg]]: The brewery in Clausen, Luxembourg (1865). One of the Photothèque's oldest photographs]]
The holdings comprise some four million photographs taken between 1855 and the present day.&lt;ref name="ALBAD"/&gt;  They have been built up over the years through donations and bequests as well as by works specifically funded by the city. Most of the archives are on the ground floor while the first floor is occupied by the city's binding service as well as by the remaining archives.&lt;ref name="vdl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ALBAD"&gt;[http://www.albad.lu/downloads/29jul.vz04phototheque.pdf "Visite à la photothèque de Luxembourg-ville: Instants de mémoire"], ALBAD: Associatioun vun de Lëtzebuerger Bibliotekären, Archivisten en Dokumentalisten. {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 2 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most important collections are those of [[Batty Fischer]] (some 10,000 documents showing the look of the city between 1890 and 1958); [[Théo Mey]] (some 400,000 photographs of the Grand Duchy in the 1950s and 1960s); the archives of [[Edouard Kutter (1887)|Edouard Kutter]] and his [[Edouard Kutter (1934)|son of the same name]] (comprising some 200,000 photographs of the [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg|Grand Ducal family]] and of news items from 1950 to 1980); [[Tony Krier]] (400,000 images of Luxembourg City, the Grand Duchy and events from 1939 to 1967); as well as a collection of some 500,000 negatives from Camille and Pol Aschman covering news items from 1935 to 1988.&lt;ref name="vdl"/&gt;

In 1992, Remo Raffaelli &amp;mdash; who had worked together with Jacques Bohler, a photographer with ''Républicain Lorrain'' and ''Tageblatt'' &amp;mdash; donated 40,000 negatives related to newspaper articles on sport and culture between 1976 and 1988. In 1994, Pierre Bertogne enriched the holdings with a further 16,000 images taken during the 1930s and 1940s which include photographs of Luxembourg's [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|occupation]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and its subsequent liberation.&lt;ref name="Fielder"/&gt;

Martine Theisen, who has been at the Photothèque since 1989 and has held the post of director since 1998, explains that most people come to see the older pictures which remind them of the city as it was when they were children. Efforts are still being made to build up the collection in order to ensure wider coverage of the city and its history. Among the ten people working at the Photothèque, there is also a photographer who is regularly assigned to keep abreast of  changes in the city's development. In relation to digitization, Ms Theisen explains that it has not yet been possible to find a firm capable of handling such a large assignment under suitable conditions. Efforts will however continue in this direction in the future.&lt;ref name="ALBAD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vdl.lu/index.php?id=10202&amp;original_suffix=1&amp;site=vdl_multimedia&amp;lang=fr&amp;path=1%252C641221%252C21388%252C6246%252C6145 Carlo Fötler, "Städtische Photothek: Seit 1983 das optische Gedächtnis der Stadt"], ''Op onser Gemeng'' No. 12 July 2008, Ville de Luxembourg. {{De icon}} Retrieved 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

Each photograph is initially registered with a numerical code showing the year of acquisition, the number of the album where it is held and its sequential number in the acquisition records. In addition, catalogue cards give a detailed description of the work, its origin and author, the date when the photograph was taken, as well as information about the negative and applicable copyright. These details are kept together with the corresponding photograph in metal-backed albums, each containing between 25 and 30 documents. The negatives are stored separately in chronological order with codes identifying the album in question. Works of special historical value are removed from the collection for safekeeping and replaced with copies. The alphabetic index is based on pertinent items from the description of the photograph.&lt;ref name="Fielder"&gt;[http://www.onsstad.lu/index.php?id=242&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bauthor%5D=163&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bletter%5D=C&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bswords%5D=%23&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=896&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=246&amp;cHash=9b540aff71 Jean-Pierre Fielder, "L'Histoire d'une photothèque"], ''Ons Stad'', No. 45, 1994. {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 28 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and copying service==

Since 2000, four books in the series "''Les trésors de la photothèque''" have been published. Each volume presents the work of one of the Photothèque's best represented photographers. Those published to date cover Pol Aschman (photojournalism from 1935 to 1988), Marcel Schroeder (local history up to 1999), Théo Mey (photojournalism from 1950 to 1980), Tony Krier (reportages from 1939 to 1972). All are available at the Photothèque. Visitors are also able to purchase paper copies of the archived photographs, usually for less than [[Euro|€]]10 per copy for standard size. Owing to copyright regulations, digital copies are not available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albad.lu/downloads/21oct.wz37.pdf "Fotothek der Stadt Luxemburg: Das Auge der Hauptstadt"], ALBAD: Associatioun vun de Lëtzebuerger Bibliotekären, Archivisten en Dokumentalisten. {{De icon}} Retrieved 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and [[models of scientific inquiry]], '''postpositivism''' (also called '''''postempiricism''''') is a [[metatheoretical]] stance that critiques and amends [[positivism]]&lt;ref name="Bergman2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergman|first1=Mats|article=Positivism|title=The International Encyclopedia of Communication Theory and Philosophy|date=2016|isbn=9781118766804|page=1–5|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118766804.wbiect248/full|ref=IntEncycCTP}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While positivists emphasize independence between the researcher and the researched person (or object), postpositivists accept that theories, background, knowledge and values of the researcher can influence what is observed.&lt;ref name="Robson2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robson|first=Colin|title=Real World Research.

==Philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Postpositivists believe that human knowledge is based not on a priori assessments from an objective individual&lt;ref name="TaylorLindlof2011"/&gt;, but rather upon human ''[[conjectural|conjectures]]''. As human knowledge is thus unavoidably conjectural, the assertion of these conjectures are ''warranted'', or more specifically, justified by a set of ''[[Theory of justification|warrant]]s'', which can be modified or withdrawn in the light of further investigation.  However, postpositivism is not a form of [[relativism]], and generally retains the idea of [[objective truth]].

===Ontology===
Postpositivists believe that a reality exists, but, unlike positivists, they believe reality can be known only imperfectly&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; and probabilistically.&lt;ref name="Robson2002" /&gt; Postpositivists also draw from [[social constructionism]] in forming their understanding and definition of reality.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

===Axiology===
While positivists believe that research is or can be value-free or value-neutral, postpositivists take the position that bias is undesired but inevitable, and therefore the investigator must work to detect and try to correct it. Postpositivists work to understand how their [[axiology]] (i.e. values and beliefs) may have influenced their research, including through their choice of measures, populations, questions, and definitions, as well as through their interpretation and analysis of their work.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

==History==
Historians identify two types of positivism: classical positivism, an empirical tradition first described by [[Claude_Henri_de_Rouvroy,_comte_de_Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]] and [[Auguste Comte]]&lt;ref name="Bergman2016" /&gt;, and [[logical positivism]], which is most strongly associated with the [[Vienna Circle]], which met near Vienna, Austria, in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; Postpositivism is the name D.C. Phillips&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; gave to a group of critiques and amendments which apply to both forms of positivism.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

One of the first thinkers to criticize [[logical positivism]] was [[Karl Popper|Sir Karl Popper]]. He advanced [[Falsifiability|falsification]] in lieu of the logical positivist idea of [[verificationism]].&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;. Falsificationism argues that it is impossible to verify that beliefs about universals or unobservables are true, though it is possible to reject false beliefs if they are phrased in a way amenable to falsification. [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s idea of [[paradigm shift]]s offers a broader critique of logical positivism, arguing that it is not simply individual theories but whole [[worldview]]s that must occasionally shift in response to evidence.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; 

Postpositivism is not a rejection of the [[scientific method]], but rather a reformation of positivism to meet these critiques.  It reintroduces the basic assumptions of positivism: the possibility and desirability of [[objective truth]], and the use of [[experiment]]al [[methodology]]. The work of philosophers [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] and [[Ian Hacking]] are representative of these ideas.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Postpositivism of this type is described in [[social science]] guides to research methods.&lt;ref name="soc_rsch_Trochim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trochim|first1=William|title=Social Research Methods Knowledge Base|url=https://socialresearchmethods.net/kb|website=socialresearchmethods.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Structure and Nature of a Postpositivist Theory==

Robert Dubin describes the basic components of a postpositivist theory as being composed of basic "units" or ideas and topics of interest, "laws of interactions" among the units, and a description of the "boundaries" for the theory.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt; A postpositivist theory also includes "empirical indicators" to connect the theory to observable phenomena, and hypotheses that are testable using the scientific method.&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

According to Thomas Kuhn, a postpositivist theory can be assessed on the basis of whether it is "[[Accuracy and precision|accurate]]", "[[Consistency|consistent]]", "has broad scope", "[[Occam's razor|parsimonious]]", and "fruitful".&lt;ref name="kmiller_2007" /&gt;

{{Fertile Crescent myth}}
The [[religion]]s of the [[ancient Near East]] were mostly [[polytheistic]], with some early examples of primitive [[monolatry]] ([[Yahweh|Yahwism]]/[[Judaism]], [[Marduk]]ites), [[Ashurism]] and [[Monism]] ([[Atenism]]). Some scholars believe that the similarities between these religions indicate that the religions are related, a belief known as [[patternism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Siege Perilous: Essays in Biblical Anthropology and Kindred Subjects|author=Samuel H. Hooke|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1970|page=174|isbn=0-8369-5525-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions of the ancient near East and their offshoots can be traced to [[Ancient Semitic religion#Proto-Semitic pantheon|Proto-Semitic religion]]. Other religions in the ancient Near East include [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], the [[Luwian]] and [[Hittites|Hittite]] religions of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Sumerian religion]] of ancient Mesopotamia. Offshoots of Proto-Semitic religion include [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Assyro-Babylonian religion]], [[Canaanite religion]], and [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|Arabian religion]]. [[Judaism]] is a development of Canaanite religion, both Indo-European and Semitic religions influenced the [[ancient Greek religion]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] was a product of ancient [[Indo-Iranian religion]]. In turn these religious traditions strongly influenced the later monotheistic religions of [[Christianity]], [[Mandeanism]], [[Sabianism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Islam]], and [[Manicheanism]], which inherited their monotheism from Judaism and [[Zoroastrianism]]. 

==Overview==
The history of the [[ancient Near East]] spans more than two millennia, from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Iron Age]], in the region now known as the [[Middle East]], centered on the [[Fertile Crescent]]. There was much cultural contact, so that it is justified to summarize the whole region under a single term, but that does not mean, of course, that each historical period and each region should not be looked at individually for a detailed description. This article will attempt to outline the common traits of ancient Near Eastern religions, and refer to sub-articles for in-depth descriptions.

{{Middle Eastern deities}}
The ancient Near East includes the following subregions:
*[[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]): [[Sumerian religion]], [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]]
*[[Ancient Egypt]]: [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]
*The [[Levant]] ([[Canaan]], [[Ugarit]], [[Ebla]], [[Mitanni]]): [[ancient Canaanite religion]], [[Judaism]]
*[[Anatolia]] (the [[Hittites]], [[Assuwa league]], [[Arzawa]]): [[Hittite mythology]], [[Hurrians#Religion|Hurrian religion]]
*The [[Caucasus]] and the [[Armenian Highlands]] ([[Urartu]])
*[[History of Iran|Ancient Iran]] ([[Elam]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]]):  [[Zoroastrianism]]
*[[Cyprus]], [[Crete]] ([[Minoan civilization]]): [[Minoan religion]]

The earliest sources, from c. 2500 BC, allow glimpses of Sumerian religion and [[ancient Egyptian religion]].

Early [[Hittite mythology|Hittite religion]] bore traits descended from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], but the later Hittite religions became more and more assimilated to Mesopotamian religion.

[[Ancient Greek religion]] was strongly influenced by ancient Near Eastern religion, but is usually not included in the term. The [[Greco-Roman mysteries]] of the [[Hellenistic period]] were again consciously connected with ancient Egyptian religion.

There are broad practices that these religions often hold in common:
* [[Ritual purification|Purification and cleansing rituals]]
* [[Sacrifice]]s ([[plant]] and [[animal sacrifice]],  [[libation]]s, rarely, but prominently in mythology, [[human sacrifice]])
* [[Polytheism]] (Though Egypt and Greece were [[Henotheism|Henotheistic]] societies)
* [[list of cities of the ancient Near East|City-state]]–sponsored religions ([[theocracy]])
* [[Sacred prostitution]]
* [[Divination]]
* [[Magic (paranormal)|Magic]] ([[invocation]]s, [[evocation|conjurings]] and [[amulet|talismans]])

Typically, ancient Near Eastern religions were centered on [[theocracy|theocracies]], with a dominating regional cult of the god of a city-state. There were also super-regional mythemes and deities, such as the God [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and the [[katabasis#Trip into the underworld|descent to the underworld]].

[[Divination]]s:
*[[Apantomancy]]: seeing animals
*[[Cleromancy]]: drawing lots
*[[Haruspex|Hepatoscopy]]: observing the liver of an animal
*[[Aeromancy|Nephomancy]]: cloud-watching
*[[Ornithomancy]]: watching birds in flight
*[[Capnomancy]]: divination through smoke
*[[Oneiromancy]]: divination through dreams

[[File:Khashkhamer seal moon worship.jpg|thumb|250px|Impression of the cylinder seal of Ḫašḫamer, patesi (High Priest) of [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] at [[Iškun-Sin]], c. 2400 BC]]

===Astrology===
Identification of the gods and goddesses with heavenly bodies—planets, stars, the sun and the moon—and to assigning the seats of all the deities in the Heavens is found in Assyro-Babylonian religion.

The personification of the two great luminaries—the sun and the moon—was the first step in the unfolding of this system, and this was followed by placing the other deities where [[Shamash]] and [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] had their seats. This process, which reached its culmination in the post-Hammurabic period, led to identifying the planet [[Venus]] with [[Ishtar]], [[Jupiter]] with [[Marduk]], [[Mars]] with [[Nergal]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] with [[Nabu]], and [[Saturn]] with [[Ninurta]].

The system represents a harmonious combination of two factors, one of popular origin, the other the outcome of speculation in the schools attached to the temples of Babylonia. The popular factor is the belief in the influence exerted by the movements of the heavenly bodies on occurrences on earth—a belief naturally suggested by the dependence of life, vegetation and guidance upon the two great luminaries. Starting with this belief the Priests and Priestesses built up the theory of the close correspondence between occurrences on earth and phenomena in the Heavens. The Heavens presenting a constant change even to the superficial observer, the conclusion was drawn of a connection between the changes and the ever-changing movement in the fate of individuals and of nature as well as in the appearance of nature.

To read the signs of the heavens was therefore to understand the meaning of occurrences on Earth, and with this accomplished, it was also possible to foretell what events were portended by the position and relationship to one another of the sun, the moon, the planets and certain stars. Myths that symbolized changes in season or occurrences in nature were projected on the heavens, which were mapped out to correspond to the divisions of the earth.

All the [[god]]s, [[demon (classical mythology)|demons]] and [[spirit]]s had their places assigned to them in the heavens, and facts, including such as fell within the domain of [[political history]], were interpreted in terms of astral theology. So completely did this system in the course of time sway men's minds that the cults and sects, from being an expression of [[animism|animistic beliefs]], took on the color derived from the "astral" interpretation of occurrences and doctrines. It left its trace in [[incantation]]s, [[omen]]s and [[hymn]]s and gave birth to [[astronomy]], which was assiduously cultivated because a knowledge of the heavens was the very foundation of the system of belief unfolded by the priests of Babylonia and Assyria.

As an illustration of the manner in which the doctrines of the religion were made to conform to the all-pervading astral theory, it will be sufficient to refer to the modification undergone in this process of the view developed in a very early period which apportioned the control of the universe among the three gods Anu, Enlil and Ea. Disassociating these Gods from all local connections, Anu became the power presiding over the Heavens, to Enlil was assigned the earth and the atmosphere immediately above it, while Ea ruled over the deep. With the transfer of all the Gods to the heavens, and under the influence of the doctrine of the correspondence between the heavens and the earth, Anu, Enlil and Ea became the three "ways" (as they are called) on the heavens.

The "ways" appear in this instance to have been the designation of the [[ecliptic circle]], which was divided into three sections or zones—a northern, a middle and a southern zone, Anu being assigned to the first, Enlil to the second, and Ea to the third zone. The astral theology of the Babylonian-Assyrian religion, while thus bearing the ear-marks of a system devised by the priests, succeeded in assimilating the beliefs which represented the earlier attempts to systematize the more popular aspects of the religion, and in this way a unification of diverse elements was secured that led to interpreting the contents and the form of the religion in terms of the astral-theological system{{clarify|date=May 2013}}.

===Ethic===
On the [[ethics|ethical]] sides, the religion of Babylonia more particularly, and to a less extent that of Assyria, advances to noticeable conceptions of the qualities associated with the Gods and Goddesses and of the duties imposed on man. Shamash, the Sun-God, was invested with justice as his chief trait, Marduk is portrayed as full of mercy and kindness, and Ea is in general the protector of mankind, a father who takes them under his protection. The Gods, to be sure, are easily aroused to anger, and in some of them the dire aspects predominated, but the view becomes more and more pronounced that there is some cause always for the [[divine wrath]]. Though, in accounting for the anger of the Gods, no sharp distinction is made between moral offences and a ritualistic oversight or neglect, yet the stress laid in the hymns and prayers, as well as in the elaborate [[wikt:atonement|atonement]] ritual prescribed in order to appease the anger of the Gods, on the need of being clean and pure in the sight of the higher powers, the inculcation of a proper aspect of [[humility]], and above all the need of confessing one's guilt and sins without any reserve—all this bears testimony to the strength which the ethical factor acquired in the domain of the Religion.

This factor appears to less advantage in the unfolding of the views concerning [[life after death]]. Throughout all periods of Babylonian-Assyrian history, the conception prevailed of a large dark cavern below the earth, not far from the [[Apsu]]—the fresh water abyss encircling and flowing underneath the earth—in which all the dead were gathered and where they led a miserable existence of inactivity, amid gloom and dust. Occasionally a favoured individual was permitted to escape from this general fate and placed in a pleasant island. It would appear also that the rulers were always singled out for [[divine grace]], and in the earlier periods of the history, owing to the prevailing view that the rulers stood nearer to the Gods than other mortals, the kings were deified after death, and in some instances divine honours were paid to them even during their lifetime.

===Demonology===
{{Main|Mesopotamian demon|l1=Mesopotamian Demon}}

Ancient Near Eastern religion knew an elaborate system of benevolent, neutral and malevolent demons (which more resembled Greek [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]]s than the [[Christian]] concept of evil demons), and much of medicine consisted of [[exorcism]]s, e.g. of [[Lamashtu]], the [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] demoness responsible for complications at childbirth and infant deaths.

In Assyrian and Babylonian mythology the seven evil demons were known as ''[[Shedu]]'' or ''[[Lamassu]]'', meaning "storm-demon". They were represented in [[Bull (mythology)|winged bull form]], derived from the colossal bulls used as protective genii of royal palaces, the name "Shed" assumed also the meaning of a propitious genius in [[Babylon]]ian magical literature.&lt;ref&gt;See Delitzsch, ''Assyrisches Handwörterbuch''. pp. 60, 253, 261, 646; Jensen, ''Assyr.-Babyl. Mythen und Epen'', 1900, p. 453; [[Archibald Sayce]], l.c. pp. 441, 450, 463; [[François Lenormant|Lenormant]], l.c. pp. 48–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greater Iran==
{{see also|Greater Iran}}
Ancient Iranian lands had a diversity of spiritual beliefs, and the religions included Zoroastrianism, Mazdakism, Manichaeism, Yazdanism, Mandeanism, and others. [[Mitanni-Aryan|Ancient Mitanni]] was centred in modern-day Kurdistan, and from excavations it was discovered to have a history of Zoroastrian practices.

==Egypt==
{{main|Ancient Egyptian religion}}
The dominant religious rituals and beliefs of [[ancient Egypt]] merged and developed over time.
As an example, during the [[New Kingdom]], the Gods [[Ra]] and [[Amun]] were syncretized into a single God, [[Amun-Ra]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide'', Harvard University Press 2004, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
Such syncretism should be distinguished from mere groupings, also referred to as "families" such as Amun, Mut, and Khonsu. Over time, Gods took part in multiple syncretic relationships, for instance, the combination of Ra and [[Horus]] into [[Ra-Herakty]].
Similarly, Ptah, [[Seker]], and [[Osiris]] became ''Ptah-Seker-Osiris''.

==Levant==
{{main|Canaanite religion|Judaism}}
The deities worshipped in [[Canaanite religion]] during the Late Bronze Age notably included
[[El Elyon]] and his sons, the [[Elohim]], the goddess [[Anat]] and [[Hadad]], the storm god and heroic slayer of [[Yam (god)|Yam]]. 
The composition of the [[Hebrew Bible]] began centuries after the [[Bronze Age collapse]], but many of these names are still reflected in Biblical Hebrew, including Elohim and the title [[Ba'al]], originally a title of Hadad, as the rival or nemesis of [[Yahweh]].

==Anatolia==
[[File:HittiteSeatedDeityAnatolia13thCenturyBCE.jpg|thumb|200px|Seated deity, late Hittite Empire (13th century BC)]]

{{main|Hittite mythology}}
{{further|Song of Kumarbi}}

Heavily influenced by [[Mesopotamian mythology]], the religion of the [[Hittites]] and [[Luwian]]s retains noticeable [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] elements, for example [[Teshub|Tarhunt]] the God of thunder, and his conflict with the Serpent-God [[Illuyanka]].

Tarhunt has a son, [[Telepinu (god)|Telepinu]] and a daughter, [[Inara (goddess)|Inara]]. Inara is involved with the [[Puruli]] spring festival. She is a protective Goddess (&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;LAMMA). [[Ishara]] is a Goddess of the oath.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">'''Stillman Drake''' (December 24, 1910 &amp;ndash; October 6, 1993) was a Canadian historian of science best known for his work on [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642). Drake published over 131 books, articles, and book chapters on Galileo.

==Biography==
Drake received his first academic appointment in 1967 as full professor at the [[University of Toronto]] after a  career as a financial consultant.  During that time he had begun his studies of the works of Galileo and translated Galileo's ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'' (1953), parts of four of Galileo's works in ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'' (1957), and Galileo's ''[[The Assayer]]'' in ''The Controversy of Comets'' (1960), co-authored with C. D. O'Malley.&lt;ref name=Eloge&gt;[[Jed Z. Buchwald]], Noel M. Swerdlow. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/235285 Eloge]: Stillman Drake, 24 December 1910-6 October 1993". ''Isis'', Vol. '''85''', No. 4 (Dec., 1994), pp. 663–666.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly his most significant contribution to the [[history of science]] was his defense of Galileo's experiments as documented in his published ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' and in his manuscript notes.  Drake showed how the complex interaction of [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|experimental measurement]] and mathematical analysis led Galileo to his [[Galileo Galilei#Falling bodies|law of falling bodies]]. This refuted [[Alexandre Koyré|Alexandre Koyré's]] claim that experiment played no significant part in Galileo's thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In 1984 Drake was awarded the Galileo Galilei Prize for the Italian History of Science by the Italian [[Rotary Clubs]]. The jury was composed of Italian epistemologists and science historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} {{cite web |url=http://www3.humnet.unipi.it/galileo/fondazione/Vincitori%20Premio%20Galilei/Stillman_Drake.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722063626/http://www3.humnet.unipi.it/galileo/fondazione/Vincitori%20Premio%20Galilei/Stillman_Drake.htm |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Drake was awarded the [[George Sarton Medal|Sarton Medal]] by the [[History of Science Society]].  He spent his entire academic career, beginning in 1967, at the [[University of Toronto]]'s Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology.&lt;ref name=Eloge/&gt;

Earlier in life, several years after receiving his Bachelor's degree at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (1932), Drake joined several college friends in creating the original version of a board game called ''Empire'' in 1938, which went on to inspire [[Peter Langston]] to create his [[Empire Classic|computer game of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://empire-game.org/empire/game-resources/rules/1938-rules-summary/ Drake's one-page summary of the rules to ''Empire'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://empire-game.org/empire/history/history-resources/langston-empire/ Langston on Empire vs Empire], Peter Langston, 2011-1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tactical beacon''' or '''TACBE''' as it is often known to be used by British and American armed forces (usually by Special Forces) for many years. Its primary role is to contact planes or helicopters which may be overhead or nearby.
The system's main use is a [[distress signal]], sending out a constant danger message to [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] planes. However, it can also be used as a short range communications device with local aircraft. Using it indicates that one is in danger and needs help.

'''[[Tal Al-Farani]]''' ({{lang-ar|تل الفراني }}), a place mentioned in the [[Torah]] located in [[Israel]], about 3.5 km to the east of the Mediterranean Sea, between Ashdod and Ashkelon, and an area of about 10 hectares, was inhabited and populated during the first three stages of the ancient Bronze Age and only during the third phase of Ancient Bronze Age.

Tal Al-Farani is considered one of the archaeological sites in the town of [[Hamama]], where this landmark is an archeological hill where the remains of a population from the Canaanite era until the Byzantine era. The excavations revealed Canaanite fortifications on this hill. The Farani Hill is located in the north-east of Hamama, Al-Abtah to the west directly from the railway line between Lod and Gaza, and this hill is located in the property of the Farani family (Hamamiya).

'''''Technology, Tradition and the State in Africa''''' is a book studying the indigenous political systems of sub-Saharan Africa written by the British social anthropologist [[Jack Goody]] (1919&amp;ndash;2015), then a professor at St. John's College, [[Cambridge University]]. It was first published in 1971 by [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[International African Institute]].

Divided into five chapters, the short book is devoted to Goody's argument that former scholars studying sub-Saharan Africa had made mistakes by comparing its historical development to that in Europe, believing the two to be fundamentally different due to technological differences between the two continents. In particular he criticises the idea that African political systems were ever [[feudalism|feudal]], believing that such a concept &amp;ndash; while applicable to Medieval Europe &amp;ndash; was not applicable to pre-colonial Africa.

==Synopsis==

===Chapter One: Feudalism in Africa?===
In the first chapter, entitled "Feudalism in Africa?", Goody explores the various definitions of the word "[[feudalism]]", and the manner in which it has been used to describe historical societies across both Europe and Asia, and also the manner in which social anthropologists have used it to refer to contemporary societies in Africa. He proceeds to discuss the various definitions of feudalism, and the way in which it has been used by both noted sociologists such as [[Max Weber]] and [[Karl Marx]] and also by historians like [[Marc Bloch]]. Goody then goes into greater detail regarding how the term has been used to refer to various African states, such as S.F. Nadel's use of the term to refer to [[Nupe people|Nupe]] society in his book ''A Black Byzantium'' (1942), and Maquet's use of the term to refer to the states of the [[Ruanda]] in his work ''The Premise of Inequality in Ruanda'' (1961), believing that the use of the term "feudal" &amp;ndash; which has its basis in historical investigation into Medieval Europe &amp;ndash; is simply unnecessary in both of these cases.

These abstractions make for too crude a level of analysis."
|salign    = right
|source    = Jack Goody, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goo71|Goody 1971]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Moving on to look at the "economic approach to feudalism", Goody challenges the view championed by "orthodox [[Marxism|Marxists]]" such as [[I.I. Potemkin]] that in Africa, feudal states emerged because land was controlled by powerful land owners to whom the peasants were indebted, having to pay rent or proving services in return for being allowed to farm the land. Instead, Goody argues, in much of Africa, land was plentiful and "of little economic importance", and that such a feudal system of land ownership was simply not applicable. Goody proceeds to argue that while Africanists should not adopt the term "feudalism" from historians of Medieval Europe, there should be greater interdisciplinary work on Africa from historians, anthropologists and sociologists alike.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goo71|Goody 1971]]. pp. 1&amp;ndash;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter Two: Polity and the Means of Production===
Goody devotes the second chapter to an examination of the economic and technological aspects of pre-colonial African society, which he argues distinguish it from Medieval Europe specifically and Eurasia more generally. He begins with a brief discussion of the complex trade networks across Sub-Saharan Africa that existed prior to contact with Europeans, noting that it certain respects Africa had a [[monetary economy]] that was similar to that of Western Europe. However, according to Goody it was in its "[[means of production]]" rather than its "productive relations" that Africa's economy differed greatly from that of Eurasia; describing the continent as a "land of extensive agriculture", Goody noted that it had a relatively small population, plentiful land, and poor soils, and that notably the majority of Africa did not have access to the [[plough]], an invention that only reached as far south as [[Ethiopia]].

Goody goes on to look at the nature of land in Africa, arguing that it was both more plentiful and less productive than that in Europe, leading Africans to move their farms around more often. He argues that the nature of land in Africa meant that the concept of [[serfdom]], a prominent part of Medieval European society, never developed there. He rounds up the chapter with a discussion of the role that horses and cavalry played in the African military.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goo71|Goody 1971]]. pp. 21&amp;ndash;38.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the differences that make the application of the European concept of 'feudalism' inappropriate. But the problem is not only historical; in many areas 'traditional' African social structure exists (in a somewhat modified form) precisely because the rural economy has not greatly changed. It is not only the comparative analysis of historians and sociologists that needs to take cognizance of these facts, but also the decisions of planners, developers, and politicians (both reforming and conserving)."

}}
In ''Technology, Tradition and the State in Africa'', Goody presents his argument that the label "feudal" is not applicable when referring to African states, considering it to be a word that is primarily used to describe the societies of Medieval Europe. Although Goody accepted the possible existence of "broad resemblances between the states of medieval Europe and those of pre-colonial Africa", in particular similarities between their "monarchical systems of government", he dismisses the use of such a "vague and all-embracing concept" as feudalism, believing that it ignores the multiple differences &amp;ndash; primarily regarding "economics and technology" &amp;ndash; which differentiate the two continents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goo71|Goody 1971]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goody criticised those Africanists, such as S.F. Nadel and J.J. Maquet, who have used such a term to describe societies which they are studying, but praised M.G. Smith, L.A. Fallers and L.P. Mair, who "make at least as adequate an analysis [in their own studies] without introducing the concept at all." According to Goody, "This second approach seems preferable as a procedure. It is simpler; it minimizes the inevitable Western bias; and it helps to avoid the assumption that because we find [[vassalage]] (for example), we necessarily find the other institutions associated with it in medieval Europe."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goo71|Goody 1971]]. pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

He notes the trend for orthodox Marxist scholars in particular to claim that certain African states were feudal, arguing that because of their adherence to Marxism, they are "apt to fall back upon the idea of universal progression from tribalism to slavery, feudalism, capitalism, and finally socialism, each stage being characterized by a particular set of social institutions."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goo71|Goody 1971]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he notes that the theories of Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] &amp;ndash; the founders of Marxist thought &amp;ndash; gave much to the study of how society's progress, Goody believed that this orthodox Marxist approach when dealing with African history "blocks advance" because it held to a "rigid attachment to particular European-based schema, whether this be derived from an explicit ideological commitment or from an inability to see beyond our own cultural tradition."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goo71|Goody 1971]]. pp. 13&amp;ndash;14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he rejected the term "feudalism", which he considered to be rooted to the study of Medieval Europe, Goody did however believe that "Africanists certainly have something to learn from the studies of medieval historians", noting that "valuable material for comparative analysis" can be found on such topics as "inheritance, marriage, [and] descent".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goo71|Goody 1971]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; by msela

[[Image:JFTcover.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''The Jesus Family Tomb''.]]
'''''The Jesus Family Tomb: The Discovery, the Investigation, and the Evidence That Could Change History''''' ({{ISBN|0061192023}}) is a controversial book by [[Simcha Jacobovici]] and [[Charles R. Pellegrino]] (with a Foreword by [[James Cameron]]) published in February 2007.  It tells the story of the discovery of the [[Talpiot Tomb]] on Friday March 26, 1980 and makes an argument that it is the tomb of [[Jesus Christ]] and his "[[Desposyni|family]]."

The book is a tie-in with the documentary ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'', which was released on the [[Discovery Channel]] in early March 2007.

==The Names in the Tomb==
The tomb in [[Talpiot]], excavated in 1980&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/02/25/tomb_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070225073000 Discovery Channel :: News - Archaeology :: Jesus Family Tomb Believed Found&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307120414/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/02/25/tomb_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070225073000 |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[salvage archaeology]], originally contained ten [[ossuaries]] - bone boxes for secondary burial. Of the ten, one vanished - presumably stolen - right after it had been catalogued. This may be the [[James Ossuary]] the brother of Y'shua, although the such claim is refuted by the professor who oversaw the archaeological work.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Kloner-A-great-story-but-nonsense|title=Kloner: A great story, but nonsense|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the other nine, six were inscribed with names.  As translated in ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' and ''The Jesus Family Tomb'', they read as follows:

*Ossuary #80/503 [[Yeshua bar Yosef]] -- [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "Jesus son of Joseph"
*Ossuary #80/505  ''Maria''—written in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]], but a [[Latin]] form of the Hebrew name "Miriam" ("Mary")&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/us/27jesus.html?em&amp;ex=1172725200&amp;en=cf806e5e644ad636&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=Crypt Held Bodies of Jesus and Family, Film Says |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ossuary #80/504  ''Yose''—a diminutive of "Joseph" mentioned (in its Greek form ιωσης "Joses") as the name of one of Jesus's brothers in the New Testament ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:3}})
*Ossuary #80/501  ''Yehuda bar Yeshua''—possibly Aramaic for "Judah son of Jesus"
*Ossuary #80/500''Mariamene e Mara''—according to the filmmakers this is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "Mary known as the master." The similar name "[[Mariamne (name)|Mariamne]]" is found in the [[Acts of Philip]]. Francois Bovon, professor of the history of religion at [[Harvard University]] has said, based on his study of that work, "I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=656 Letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Matya''—Hebrew for 'Matthew'—''not'' claimed to be [[Matthew the Evangelist]] but "possibly a husband of one of the women in an unmarked ossuary." The filmmakers claim that there is evidence that Mary mother of Jesus had many relatives named Matthew.&lt;ref name="goodstein"/&gt;

==The tenth ossuary==
The authors present a case for the [[James ossuary|ossuary]] of James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus (Yakov ben Yosef akhui diYeshua). This controversial relic, accepted as legitimate by some, is believed by others in the field as fraudulent. Prominent among those who believe its authenticity is Hershel Shanks, editor of ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''. An ongoing forgery trial in Israel has failed to disprove its authenticity. These doubts are the result of the ossuary being unprovenanced - that is, not found in a legitimate excavation. The book presents what the authors purport to be firm scientific evidence that the James ossuary is the missing tenth ossuary from the Talpiot tomb.

The film makers from ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' had the outside layer of dirt tested against the other 9 ossuaries that were found in the tomb, and the dirt on the outside of the James ossuary was proven to be made up of the same minerals as the other 9 ossuaries.  In the documentary they stated that this was nearly impossible if not from the same tomb.

However, Prof. Amos Kloner, who oversaw the archaeological work at Talpiot tomb, refutes the such claim.  According to Prof Kloner, the James Ossuary cannot be the missing 10th ossuary because the 10th ossuary had no inscription and had different dimensions.  In fact, he has stated that the 10th ossuary was not missing at all.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

==Controversy==
Not only are some of the names on the bone boxes relatively common names, but no writings of Jesus' life, canonical or apocryphal, reported a marriage or children. The authenticity of the nine remaining ossuaries, and of the names inscribed on them, is under no doubt or suspicion. However, the identities of these people are open to much controversy and debate. They are either nine otherwise unknown Jewish people from first-century Jerusalem, or [[Jesus]] himself and, presumably, eight members of his family. Recently, some of the scholars quoted in the Discovery Channel documentary have issued strong clarifications, backtracking on some of the central claims made in the film and book. Namely, University of Toronto statistician Professor Andrey Feuerverger, whose conservative statistical analysis claimed that the odds were 600:1 in favor of the tomb being the burial site of Jesus' family, has clarified his opinion, saying that these odds relate to the chances that these particular names would be found in one tomb, and not to the particular identification of individuals in the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1176152766396&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Jesus tomb film scholars backtrack | Jerusalem Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time.
"I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family", he told the [[BBC]] News website.
"The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film."{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Following a symposium at Princeton in January 2008 the media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited with most notably ''Time''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1704299,00.html Jesus 'Tomb' Controversy Reopened - TIME&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and CNN&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2008/01/18/wedeman.revisiting.jesus.tomb.cnn Video - Breaking News Videos from CNN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; devoting extensive coverage, hailing the case as being re-opened. 
Following the media's portrayal scholars present at the symposium accused Simcha Jacobovici and James Cameron for misleading the media in claiming the symposium re-opened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including significantly several of the archaeologists and epigraphers, who had delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are "nothing further from the truth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukereligion.blogspot.com/2008/01/talpiot-tomb-controversy-revisited.html Duke University Religion Department: The Talpiot Tomb Controversy Revisited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History''''' is a 2014 [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Elizabeth Kolbert]] and published by [[Henry Holt and Company]]. The book argues that the [[Earth]] is in the [[Holocene extinction|midst of a modern, man-made, sixth extinction]]. In the book, Kolbert chronicles previous mass [[extinction event]]s, and compares them to the accelerated, widespread extinctions during our present time. She also describes specific [[species]] extinguished by humans, as well as the [[ecologies]] surrounding [[prehistoric]] and near-present extinction events. The author received the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] for the book in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2015-General-Nonfiction Pulitzer citation&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[target audience]] is the [[general audience|general reader]], and [[scientific description]]s are rendered in understandable prose. The writing blends explanations of her treks to remote areas with interviews of scientists, researchers, and guides, without advocating a position, in pursuit of objectivity. Hence, the sixth mass extinction theme is applied to [[flora]] and [[fauna]] existing in diverse [[habitat]]s, such as the [[rainforest|Panamanian rainforest]], the [[Great Barrier Reef]], the [[Andes]], [[Bikini Atoll]], city [[zoo]]s, and the author's own backyard. The book also applies this theme to a number of other habitats and organisms throughout the world. After researching the current mainstream view of the relevant [[peer reviewed]] science, Kolbert estimates flora and fauna loss by the end of the 21st century to be between 20 to 50 percent "of all living species on earth".&lt;ref name=Gore/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schulz&gt;

==Anthropocene==
{{Main article|Anthropocene}}
Kolbert equates current, general unawareness of this issue to previous widespread disbelief of it during the centuries preceding the late 1700s; at that time, it was believed that [[mass extinction|prehistoric mass extinctions]] had never occurred. It was also believed there were no natural forces powerful enough to extinguish species ''[[en masse]]''. Likewise, in our own time, the possible finality presented by this issue results in [[denialism]]. But scientific studies have shown that human behavior disrupts Earth's balanced and interconnected systems, "putting our own survival in danger." Consequently, the [[biosphere|Earth systems]] currently affected are: the [[Earth's atmosphere|global atmosphere]], the [[water cycle]], the ocean's [[heat absorption]], [[ocean acidity]] (and its effect on [[coral reefs]]), [[soil moisture]] and [[drought|drought conditions]], plant destruction by [[Pest (organism)|pests]]/non-indigenous fauna or [[heat stress]], heat regulation by the Earth's ice, and so on.

The [[human species]] contributes to this disruption – even without intending to – because of our innate capabilities to alter the planet at this stage of our cultural evolution; for instance, we now have the ability to harness energy from beneath the [[Earth's surface]]. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' also have the ability to adapt relatively quickly to almost any [[Ecology#Physical environments|environment]] on this planet's surface. Other species, however, have a hard time relocating to new, suitable [[habitat]]s. They are unable to migrate ahead of current rapid ecological changes, or are hampered by artificial barriers such as roadways, [[cityscape]]s, and [[suburban sprawl]], which increase discontinuity between viable habitats throughout the world.&lt;ref name=Gore/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulz"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kakutani/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Darwall/&gt;

==Summary of chapters==
===Chapter 1: The Sixth Extinction===
The ancestors of [[frogs]] crawled out of water around 400&amp;nbsp;million years ago. 250&amp;nbsp;million years ago, frogs were the earliest representation of what would become the modern amphibian orders. Amphibians have been on Earth for longer than [[mammals]] or [[birds]]; they were even here before [[dinosaurs]]. Recently, it has been reported that the extinction rate of frogs is increasing. Based on observed extinction rates far beyond expected [[background extinction rate]]s, we can predict that an event of a catastrophic nature is headed our way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alroy|first=John|title=Speciation and Extinction in the Fossil Record or North American Mammals|journal=Cambridge University Press|date=2009|volume=Speciation and Patterns of Diversity|pages=310–23|url=http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~alroy/pdfs/2009-Speciation.pdf|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade ago, [[Panamanian golden frog]]s were plentiful in numbers and easy to find around Panama. However, within the past couple of years, the frogs started to disappear. Kolbert states that studies by the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]] in [[Washington, DC]], and a [[Mycology|mycologist]] at the [[University of Maine]], have identified the reason for the increased mortality of Panamanian frogs as a type of [[Chytrid]] fungus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Paul|title=Amphibian Chytrid Fungus|url=http://www.nps.gov/pinn/naturescience/chytrid.htm|work=US Department of the Interior|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chytrid fungi are not naturally found in Panama. This left a puzzling question: how did the [[fungus]] get to Panama? Evidence indicates that humans were instrumental in how the fungus traveled. Kolbert uses the frog-fungus relationship as a symbol of how humans are introducing [[invasive species]] to various environments, where native species would normally have the proper distribution of [[alleles]] for their environment.

===Chapter 2: The Mastodon's Molars===
Kolbert explains how fossils of the American [[mastodon]] (''Mammut americanum'') shaped [[Georges Cuvier]]'s views on [[catastrophism]]. According to Cuvier, there was no reason the mastodon should have died out. The mastodon was large enough to avoid [[predation]], had large enough teeth to consume an abrasive diet, and had other [[phenotypes]] that should have increased its chances of survival. Cuvier concluded there must have been sudden and violent natural catastrophes that caused mass extinctions of viable species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cuvier|first=Georges|title=Elegy of Lamarck|journal=Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal|volume=20|pages=1–22|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/33987#/summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolbert uses the mastodon as a symbol for the idea that [[Disaster|catastrophe]] is an important mechanism of extinction.

===Chapter 3: The Original Penguin===
The [[great auk]] was a large flightless bird that lived in the Northern Hemisphere. It had a large, intricately grooved beak. When the first settlers arrived in [[Iceland]], the auk population was probably in the millions. However, the settlers found the auks to be “very good and nourishing meat.” They also used their oily bodies for fuel and fish bait, and their feathers for stuffing mattresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaskell|first=Jeeremy|title=Who Killed the Great Auk?|date=March 15, 2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0198564783|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts at protecting the species, by 1844, the last auks were killed. Kolbert uses the great auk as a symbol of how human [[overexploitation]] of resources is another important mechanism of extinction.

===Chapter 4: The Luck of the Ammonites===
Kolbert explains that the main cause of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] was not the impact of the [[asteroid]] itself. It was the dust created by the impact. The debris from the impact incinerated anything in its path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Officer|first=Charles|title=Language of the Earth: A Literary Anthology|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, England|isbn=978-1-4051-6067-4|pages=183|edition=2nd |author2=Page, Jake |editor-first1=Frank H.&amp;nbsp;T. |editor-last1=Rhodes |editor-first2=Richard O. |editor-last2=Stone |editor-first3=Bruce D. |editor-last3=Malamud}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that it is impossible to estimate the full extent of the various species that died out due to this catastrophe. However, one class of animals we know did die out because of the effects of the asteroid's impact, are the [[Ammonoidea|ammonites]]. Kolbert explains that, even though ammonites were 'fit' for their current environment, a single moment can completely change which traits are advantageous and which are lethal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zalasiewics|first=Jan|title=The Earth After Us: What Legacy Will Humans Leave in the Rocks?|date=November 2, 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199214983|page=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 5: Welcome to the Anthropocene===
Kolbert uses the extinction of [[graptolites]] and other [[clades]] to explain [[Glacial period|glaciation]] as a mechanism for extinction. She then explains how, when [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the air are high, there typically is accompanying increase in temperatures and [[sea level]]. Right around the time graptolites became extinct, carbon dioxide levels dropped. Temperatures fell and sea levels plummeted. This caused a change in the chemistry of the ocean, which had a devastating impact on life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiessling|first=Wolfgang|title=Global Change Biology|date=2011|publisher=Oxford Printing Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199214983|pages=56–67|edition=First Paperback |author2=Simpson, Carl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolbert states that human activity has transformed between a third and a half of land surface on the planet. We have dammed most of the major rivers of world, increased levels of [[nitrogen]] higher than can be fixed naturally by terrestrial ecosystems, used more than half of the world's readily accessible freshwater [[Surface runoff|run-off]], removed more than one third of the [[primary producers]] of the oceans' coastal waters, and changed the composition of the atmosphere by [[deforestation]] and [[fossil fuel]] combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zalewicz|first=Jan|title=Are We Now Living in the Anthropocene?|journal=Geological Society of America Today|date=2008|issue=18|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 6: The Sea Around Us===
Since the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], we have seen increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at an alarming rate. Studies show we have added approximately 365&amp;nbsp;billion tons of it by burning fossil fuels, and an additional 180&amp;nbsp;billion tons as a result of deforestation. We add another 9&amp;nbsp;billion tons or so a year, an amount that has been increasing by 6&amp;nbsp;percent annually. Essentially, we have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air to higher than it has been in the last several million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabine|first=Chris|url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/|work=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory|title=PMEL CO2|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this carbon dioxide is being absorbed by our oceans to create [[carbonic acid]]. This is lowering the [[pH]] of our ocean and killing much of our marine life. Kolbert uses the drastic decline in life forms around the [[Castello Aragonese]] as a warning sign of what is to come if we continue to increase carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|title=The Acid Sea|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2011/04/ocean-acidification/|work=National Geographic Magazine|publisher=National Geographic Society|date=April 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 7: Dropping Acid===
[[Coral reefs]] support thousands of species by providing food and protection. Subsequently, many species have co-evolved with corals. Due to [[ocean acidification]], it is very possible that corals will become extinct by the end of the century. Prior to the industrial revolution, underwater reefs had an [[aragonite]] saturation state between 4 and 5. However, if current [[emission intensity|emission intensities]] remain as they are today, by 2060, there will no longer be a region above 3.5. This will lead to an increase in energy needed for [[calcification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fabricus|first=Katherina|author2=Chris Langdon|author3=Sven Uthicke|author4=Craig Humphrey|author5= Sam Noonan|author6= Glenn De'ath|author7= Remy Okazaki|author8=Nancy Muehllehner|author9=Martin S. Glass |author10= Janice M. Lough|title=Losers and Winners in Coral Reefs Acclimatized to Elevated Carbon Dioxide Concentrations|journal=Nature Climate Change |date=May 29, 2011 |url=http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n3/full/nclimate1122.html |volume=1 |issue=3 |doi=10.1038/nclimate1122 |pages=165–169 |bibcode=2011NatCC...1..165F}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extra energy that will eventually be expended on calcification is currently vital to corals, as they use it to recover from being eaten away by marine species and battered by waves. Thus, ocean acidification is a mechanism of extinction.

===Chapter 8: The Forest and the Trees===
[[Global warming]] is most commonly seen as a threat to cold-loving species. As temperatures rise, the ice at the [[North Pole]] and [[South Pole]] will melt. Any living thing that depends on the ice will be faced with extreme challenges that could ultimately drive them to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnosky|first=Anthony|title=Heatstroke: Nature in an Age of Global Warming|date=2009|publisher=Island Press/ShearwaterBooks|location=Washington, D.C|isbn=978-1597261975|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolbert points out that the poles are not the only places affected by global warming, and that other areas have much higher [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|latitudinal diversity gradients]]. She discusses the work of scientists who have used measures of [[species-area relationship]] to model possible effects of global warming. The extent to which species are mobile and can relocate to new areas, in response to shifting climate conditions, is predicted to be a significant factor in possible species extinction. This has particular importance for [[trees]] and other [[plant]] species. Even more difficult to estimate is the extent to which ecological communities of species will be able to tolerate disruptive changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripati|first=Arahdna|author2=Eagle, Robert|author3= Roberts, Christopher.|title=Coupling of CO2 and Ice Sheet Stability Over Major Climate Transitions of the Last 20 Million Years|journal=Science|date=June 28, 2009|volume=326|pages=1394–1397|doi=10.1126/science.1178296|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/326/5958/1394.abstract |issue=5958|pmid=19815724|bibcode=2009Sci...326.1394T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 9: Islands on Dry Land===
Kolbert points out how everything in life is interconnected, and discusses the importance of [[patch dynamics]]. Over time, fragmentation of environmental areas leads to a [[Depauperate ecosystem|decrease]] in the number of species in an area. This occurs, in part, because the size of such "islands" is too small to support a stable number of species members. Also, smaller populations are more vulnerable to chance events. In addition, the disconnection of islands makes it more difficult for species to reach and recolonize them. One researcher describes this as "an obstacle course for the dispersal of biodiversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolbert|first1=Elizabeth|title=The sixth extinction : an unnatural history|date=2014|publisher=Henry Holt and Co|location=New York|isbn=9780805092998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|189}} Kolbert also notes that the habits of many species can be highly specialized to their environment. She explains that one minor change can cause a [[domino effect]] in various ecological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bierregaard|first=Richard|title=Lessons from Amazonia The Ecology and Conservation of a Fragmented|date=September 2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0300084832|page=41|author2=Gascon, Claude|author3= Mesquita, Rita|author4= Lovejoy, Tomas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Emma|title=Army Ant Camp Followers|url=http://thesciencesays.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/army-ant-camp-followers/|work=Conservation: The Environment and Food Security|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Erle|author2=Ramankutty, Navin|title=Putting People in the Map: Anthropogenic Biomes of the World|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=2008|volume=6|issue=8|pages=439–447|doi= 10.1890/070062|url=http://ecotope.org/people/ellis/papers/ellis_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 10: The New Pangaea===
Kolbert points out that there is an [[evolutionary arms race]], in which each species must be equipped to defend against their potential predators, and need to be more fit than their competition. A species has no defense if it encounters a new [[fungus]], [[virus]], or [[bacterium]]. This can be extremely deadly, as it was in the case of American [[bats]] killed by the [[Psychrophile|psycrophilic]] fungus ''[[Geomyces destructans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ricciardi|first=Anthony|title=Are Modern Biological Invasions an Unprecedented Form of Global Change?|journal=Conservation Biology|date=January 21, 2007|volume=21|issue=2|pages=329–336|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00615.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00615.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this occurred in the 1800s. The [[American chestnut]] was the dominant [[deciduous]] tree in eastern American forests. Then, a fungus (''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'') started to cause [[chestnut blight]]. It was nearly 100&amp;nbsp;percent lethal. This fungus was unintentionally imported to the US by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rellou|first=Julia|title=Chestnut Blight Fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica)|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/cerc/danoff-burg/invasion_bio/inv_spp_summ/Cryphonectria_parasitica.htm|work=Introduces Species Project|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolbert then explains that global trade and travel are creating a virtual "[[Pangaea]]", in which species of all kinds are being redistributed beyond historical geographic barriers. This furthers the first chapter's idea that invasive species are a mechanism of extinction.

===Chapter 11: The Rhino Gets an Ultrasound===
The [[Sumatran Rhino]] was once so abundant in numbers it was considered an [[agricultural pest]]. However, as [[Southeast Asia]]'s forests were cut down, the rhino's habitat became fragmented. In the 1900s, the rhino population had been shrunk to just a few hundred. A captive breeding program was widely regarded as a failure and resulted in the deaths of several rhinos, and it was decades before a single baby was born. Today, there are only forty living Sumatran rhinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welz|first=Adam|title=The Dirty War Against Africa's Remaining Rhinos|journal=Yale University Press|date=November 27, 2012 |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/the_dirty_war_against_africas_remaining_rhinos/2595/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolbert uses this rhino species to illustrate [[habitat fragmentation]] as another mechanism of extinction.

===Chapter 12: The Madness Gene===
Europe was home to the [[Neanderthal]]s for at least 100,000 years. Then, about 30,000 years ago, the Neanderthals vanished. Fossil records show that modern humans arrived in Europe 40,000 years ago. Within 10,000 years, Neanderthals were bred out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Ewen|title=Modern human genomes reveal our inner Neanderthal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/modern-human-genomes-reveal-our-inner-neanderthal-1.14615 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature.2014.14615 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[molecular sequencing]], scientists have found that there is one&amp;nbsp;percent to four&amp;nbsp;percent Neanderthal DNA in all non-African humans. This indicates that humans and Neanderthals reproduced, and then the resulting [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] reproduced. The pattern continued until Neanderthals were literally bred out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alroy|first=John|title=Putting North America's End Pleistocene Megafaunal Extinction in Context|date=1999|publisher=Kluwer Acdamix/Plenum|location=New York|page=138 &lt;!--|authorlink=Extinctions in Near Time: Causes, Contexts, and Consequences --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolbert states there is every reason to believe that Neanderthals would still exist if it weren't for humans.

===Chapter 13: The Things with Feathers===
Kolbert concludes with hope in humanity, pointing to various efforts to conserve or preserve species. Whether meaning to or not, we are deciding which evolutionary pathways will be shut off forever, and which can be left open to flourish.

'''''The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory and the Legacy of Vietnam''''' (1998) is a book by Vietnam veteran and Sociology professor Jerry Lembcke. The book is an analysis of the widely believed, but historically inaccurate, [[urban legend]] that American soldiers were spat upon and insulted by [[Anti-war movement|antiwar protesters]] upon returning home from the [[Vietnam War]]. The book examines the origin of the earliest stories; the popularization of the "spat-upon image" through Hollywood movies and fiction literature, and the role of print news media in perpetuating the now iconic image through which the history of the war and antiwar movement has come to be represented.

Lembcke contrasts the absence of credible evidence of spitting by antiwar activists with the large body of evidence showing a mutually supportive, empathetic relationship between veterans and antiwar forces.  The book documents the efforts of the Nixon Administration to drive a wedge between military servicemen and the antiwar movement by portraying democratic dissent as betrayal of the troops, effectively redirecting blame for failure in Vietnam onto protesters.  Coupled with American society's exaggeration of medical conditions like [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and drug abuse among veterans to the point of broadly vilifying the Vietnam veteran as mentally unfit, emotionally volatile and a "loser" and "victim", the collective memory about Vietnam has been refocused onto the veteran and away from the war. Lembcke equates this disparagement of the antiwar movement and veterans with the similar [[Stab-in-the-back myth|'stab in the back' myths]] propagated by Germany and France after their war defeats, as an alibi for why they lost the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/06/0081080 Stabbed in the back! The Past and Future of a Right-wing Myth] Kevin Baker; ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''; June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lembcke details the resurrection of this myth of the spat-upon veteran by later administrations during subsequent Gulf War efforts as a way of silencing public dissent.

==Origins==
A persistent but unfounded criticism leveled against [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|those who protested]] the United States's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] is that protesters spat upon and otherwise derided returning soldiers, calling them "baby-killers", etc. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, years after the war in Vietnam ended, the proliferation of these spitting stories increased greatly. As both a Vietnam veteran and a member of the antiwar movement, Lembcke knew this criticism ran counter to what he personally experienced and witnessed. To the contrary, one of the hallmarks of the period's antiwar movement was its support for the troops in the field and the affiliation of many returning veterans with the movement. Lembcke was motivated to look further into the truth and origins of this spat-upon veteran myth, and the contradiction between historical fact and popular collective memory. Other observers had already noticed the proliferation of stories and questioned whether the spitting stories even made sense. In 1987, columnist [[Bob Greene]] noted: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even during the most fervent days of anti-war protest, it seemed that it was not the soldiers whom protesters were maligning.  It was the leaders of government, and the top generals—at least, that is how it seemed in memory. One of the most popular chants during the anti-war marches was, "Stop the war in Vietnam, bring the boys home." You heard that at every peace rally in America. "Bring the boys home." That was the message. Also, when one thought realistically about the image of what was supposed to have happened, it seemed questionable.  So-called "hippies," no matter what else one may have felt about them, were not the most macho people in the world. Picture a burly member of the Green Berets, in full uniform, walking through an airport.  Now think of a "hippie" crossing his path.  Would the hippie have the nerve to spit on the soldier?  And if the hippie did, would the soldier—fresh from facing enemy troops in the jungles of Vietnam—just stand there and take it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1992, the Director of the Connelly Library and curator of the Vietnam War Collection at [[La Salle University|LaSalle University]] listed the spitting myth as one of the "Top Six Myths" from the Vietnam era, and observed the myth "derives from the mythopoeic belief that returning GI's were routinely spat upon at some time during their repatriation to the USA. This particular round of tales has become so commonplace as to be treated reverently even among otherwise wisely observant veterans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Texts/Scholarly/Baky_White_Cong_01.html The Ambient Truth of Vietnam War Legendry]; John Baky, March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, scholar Paul Rogat Loeb wrote, "to consider spitting on soldiers as even remotely representative of the activist response is to validate a lie", and noted that myths like that of antiwar activists spitting on soldiers have rewritten or "erased history".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=--FmCtmAO2QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Generation+at+the+Crossroads:+Apathy+and+Action+on+the+American+Campus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=odh0VNMT2OegBLDLgpgP&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=spitting&amp;f=false Generation at the Crossroads: Apathy and Action on the American Campus]; Paul Rogat Loeb; Rutgers University Press; 1995; pgs. 77-80&lt;/ref&gt; An academic study into the making and shaping of a collective memory found that evidence of antiwar activists targeting troops was virtually nonexistent. Instead, it found popular memory was manipulated by national security elites and a complicit news media by frequently labeling resistors to U.S. war efforts as "anti-troop".&lt;ref&gt;Beamish, Thomas D., Harvey Molotch, and Richard Flacks. 1995. "Who Supports the Troops? Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the Making of Collective Memory." Social Problems Journal 42 (3):344-60&lt;/ref&gt; As observed by [[Clarence Page]] after interviewing Lembcke and Greene, "the stories have become so widely believed, despite a remarkable lack of witnesses or evidence, that ironically the burden of proof now falls on the accused, the protesters; not their accusers, the veterans. Antiwar protesters must prove the episodes didn't happen, instead of the veterans having to prove they did."&lt;ref name="JWR"&gt;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/page090298.html Whose history?]; [[Jewish World Review]]; September 2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this complete lack of evidence that spitting occurred, but acknowledging that it is impossible to prove something never happened, Lembcke set out:&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; pg. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;to show how it is possible for a large number of people to believe that Vietnam veterans were spat upon when there is no evidence that they were. In effect, my strategy was to set aside the question of whether or not such acts occurred and to show why even if they did not occur it is understandable that the image of the spat-upon veteran has become widely accepted. Indeed, given the manipulation of information and images that began with the Nixon administration and continued at the hands of filmmakers and the news media during the 1970s and 1980s, it would be remarkable if a majority of Americans had not come to believe that Vietnam veterans were abused by the antiwar movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Synopsis==

At the time he wrote ''The Spitting Image'', Lembcke had not found a single substantiated media report to support the now common claims of spitting. He theorizes that the reported "spitting on soldiers" scenario was a mythical projection by those who felt "spat upon" by an American society tired of the war; an image which was then used to discredit future antiwar activism and serve political interests. He suggests that the manufactured images of pro-war antipathy against antiwar protesters also helped contribute to the myth. Lembcke asserts that memories of being verbally and physically assaulted by antiwar protesters were largely conjured, noting that not even one case could be reliably documented. He further suggests the "baby-killer" and "murderer" components of the myth may have been reinforced, in part, by the common chants by protesters aimed at President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Baines Johnson]], like "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"

''The Spitting Image'' asserts that the image of abuse of soldiers by antiwar demonstrators only really became ingrained in the American consciousness years after the war had come to a close. Lembcke attributes part of the legend's growth to films relating to Vietnam, notably ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'', in which a "spat-upon veteran" image is popularized. He writes that the myth of the spat-upon veteran was later revived by President [[George H. W. Bush]] as a way to help suppress dissent when selling the [[Gulf War]] to the American people. Lembcke believes that resurrection of the myth was useful in promoting the [[yellow ribbon#United States|yellow ribbon]] ''Support our Troops'' campaign, as it implies that for one to support the troops, one must also support the war. It conflates the ideas of antiwar sentiment and anti-troop sentiment, despite a common antiwar chant being "Support the Troops: Bring them Home!"

The "spat-upon veteran" meme became so pervasive that some found it hard not to believe. In 1989, Bob Greene's book ''[[Homecoming: When the Soldiers Returned from Vietnam|Homecoming]]'' reprinted letters he had solicited, asking to hear from veterans if they had been spat upon.&lt;ref name="JWR"/&gt; Greene's book includes 63 alleged accounts involving spitting, and 69 accounts from veterans who do not believe anyone was spat upon after returning from Vietnam, among other stories. Greene admits he couldn't validate the authenticity of the accounts in the letters he received, but he did believe spitting must have occurred, stating, "There were simply too many letters, going into too fine a detail, to deny the fact." Greene concluded, "I think you will agree, after reading the letters, that even if several should prove to be not what they appear to be, that does not detract from the overall story that is being told."&lt;ref&gt;''Homecoming; When the Soldier Returned from Vietnam''; Bob Greene; G. P. Putnam's Sons; 1989; Pgs. 10-16&lt;/ref&gt; "Greene was too willing to suspend disbelief", says Lembcke, who cited Greene's book as an example of how prolific the stories had become and also for the patterns that appeared in them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; Pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lembke said, "These stories have to be taken very seriously, but as historical evidence they are problematic. In the first place, stories of this type didn't surface until about ten years after the end of the war. If the incidents occurred when the story tellers say they did, in the closing years of the war, why is there no evidence for that? Moreover, many of the stories have elements of such exaggeration that one has to question the veracity of the entire account."&lt;ref name="RLG"/&gt;

Lembcke points out that there were several newspaper accounts of pro-war demonstrators spitting on antiwar demonstrators and suggests that these oral accounts could easily have been reinterpreted and inverted and made into stories about activists spitting on veterans.&lt;ref name="RLG"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051014023306/http://www.rlg.org/en/page.php?Page_ID=95 1999 Annual Membership Meeting]; Research Libraries Group; 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He highlights the contradictions between the collective memory of today and contemporaneous historical records, like the results from a 1971 poll showing over 94% of returning Vietnam soldiers received a "friendly" welcome.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; Pgs. 68, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Lembcke also notes how it was older vets from previous wars who most often scorned the returning Vietnam Vets; in 1978 the [[Vietnam Veterans of America]] vowed in its founding principle: Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another.&lt;ref name="Mazur"&gt;''A More Perfect Military: How the Constitution Can Make Our Military Stronger''; Diane H. Mazur; Oxford University Press, 2010; Pgs. 98-101&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Spitting Image'' Lembcke acknowledges that he cannot prove the negative—that no Vietnam veteran was ever spat on—saying it is hard to imagine there not being expressions of hostility between veterans and activists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spitting Image''; Lembcke, Jerry; New York University Press; 1998; pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "I cannot, of course, prove to anyone's satisfaction that spitting incidents like these did not happen. Indeed, it seems likely to me that it probably did happen to some veteran, some time, some place. But while I cannot prove the negative, I can prove the positive: I can show what did happen during those years and that that historical record makes it highly unlikely that the alleged acts of spitting occurred in the number and manner that is now widely believed."&lt;ref name="RLG"/&gt;

Shafer's ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'' online articles on the matter, which frequently cited Lembcke's research, generated enormous feedback; the May 2000 article alone received nearly 300 postings on the subject in just a few days, one of its largest-ever responses.&lt;ref name="HSJournal"&gt;''[[Humanity and Society]]''; Volume 26, Number 1; February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shafer, the myth persists primarily because: 

{{quote box|width=50%|align=left|1) Those who didn't go to Vietnam—that being most of us—don't dare contradict the "experience" of those who did;

2) The story helps maintain the perfect sense of shame many of us feel about the way we ignored our Vietvets;

3) The press keeps the story in play by uncritically repeating it, as the Times and U.S. News did;

4) Because any fool with 33 cents and the gumption to repeat the myth in his letter to the editor can keep it in circulation. Most recent mentions of the spitting protester in Nexis are of this variety.}}

Shafer acknowledges that it's possible that a Vietnam veteran somewhere might have been spat upon during the war years, and notes that Lembcke concedes as much because nobody can prove something never happened.  Shafer announced a challenge to his readers, "Indeed, each time I write about the spit myth, my inbox overflows with e-mail from readers who claim that a spitting protester targeted them while they were in uniform. Or the e-mail writer claims it happened to a brother or a friend at the airport or bus station. I expect similar e-mails this time, and I will share with readers any account that comes with some sort of evidence—such as a contemporaneous newspaper story or an arrest report—that documents the sordid event.  If you can point me to a documented case of a returning Viet vet getting spat upon, please drop a line to slate.pressbox@gmail.com. E-mail may be quoted by name unless the writer stipulates otherwise."

Likewise, Lembcke joined the discussion and also commented on it in the ''[[Humanity &amp; Society]]'' journal, saying the stories just keep getting better, and asking for any evidence to be raised. The discussions spawned yet another round of more than 60 stories, yet only one was credible.&lt;ref name="HSJournal"/&gt;

Northwestern Law School professor [[James Lindgren]] also joined the discussions and, after a review of contemporary news sources, initially claimed to have found news accounts that discussed spitting incidents.  Lembcke provided an 18-point response to Lindgren's research, refuting each of his claims but expressing interest in one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/02/more_spit_takes.html]; Slate Magazine; 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A December 27, 1971 CBS Evening News report on veteran Delmar Pickett who said he was spat at in Seattle appeared, according to Lembcke, to have some validity as a claim, but still not as evidence that the incident reported actually happened.&lt;ref&gt;[[CBS Evening News]], ([[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] reporting) [http://www.slate.com/id/2161038/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=214568 Vietnam Veteran CBS News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some second-hand news accounts that mention spitting do actually exist, although there has been no evidence to support the narrative that antiwar demonstrators were responsible. Documented accounts exist where the antiwar demonstrators were actually the victims, not the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Kulik1"/&gt;  Other commentators have since addressed the myth to various degrees, even referencing the debate spawned by the Slate files.

In his 2009 book, ''War Stories'', historian and Vietnam veteran Gary Kulik devoted a whole chapter to the myth of "Spit-upon veterans".  He closely examined Greene's book of letters and the Slate files, as well as the research by Lindgren and Lembcke.&lt;ref name="Kulik1"&gt;''War Stories: False Atrocity Tales, Swift Boaters, and Winter Soldiers - What Really Happened in Vietnam; Gary Kulik; [[Potomac Books]], Inc., 2009; Pgs. 79-96&lt;/ref&gt;  Kulik noted the contradictory nature of the stories in Greene's book and concluded that Greene arrogantly dismissed the "surprising number" of veterans who "refuse to believe" the spitting stories, and wrote, "Greene was not just credulous, but negligently irresponsible."  Kulik also criticized Lindgren's research, writing, "Lindgren's evidence includes only one single first-person ("I was spit upon") account—the stories that are at the heart of Lembcke's book—and it appears the none of the accounts he cites were actually witnessed by a reporter. Moreover, Lindgren does not cite a single case of a Vietnam veteran spit upon as he returned home, and that was the story that would ultimately be repeated and believed."  Kulik concluded that the spitting stories were formulaic and unbelievable, and were propagated to serve the political goals of those who wished to vilify the antiwar movement. "The image of 'hippie' men and women hawking up gobs of phlegm to hurl at the ribbons of veterans, as a pervasive and commonplace act, is surely false."&lt;ref name="Kulik1"/&gt;
   
Specialist in civil-military relations and advisor to the National Institute of Military Justice, Diane Mazur, also examined the works by Greene, Lembcke and Lindgren, and concluded: "There is no contemporaneous evidence that Americans who opposed the war expressed those beliefs by spitting on or otherwise assaulting returning Vietnam Veterans. [...] The idea, however, that spitting on or mistreating Vietnam veterans was in any way typical or representative of anything in that era is completely false. [...] It is by far the most powerful Vietnam War meme—a cultural unit of information passed from one person to another, like a biological gene—because it can be deployed instantly to silence difficult but necessary conversations about the military.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' review:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;The image is ingrained: A Vietnam veteran, arriving home from the war, gets off a plane only to be greeted by an [[angry mob]] of antiwar protesters yelling, 'Murderer!' and 'Baby killer!' Then out of the crowd comes someone who spits in the veteran's face. The only problem, according to Jerry Lembcke, is that no such incident has ever been documented. It is instead, says Lembcke, a kind of [[urban legend|urban myth]] that reflects our lingering national confusion over the war."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"&gt;[http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookId=5151 The Spitting Image]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}; New York University Press; 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Berkshire Eagle]]'' review:
:"Well-argued and documented."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;

Karl Helicher, [[Library Journal]] review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Images of long-haired antiwar protesters, almost always women, spitting on returning Vietnam veterans have become a shameful part of America's collective memory. Lembcke (sociology, Holy Cross Univ.), a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, here presents a stunning indictment of this myth, an illusion created, he maintains, by the Nixon-Agnew administration and an unwitting press to attribute America's loss in Vietnam to internal dissension. In fact, the antiwar movement and many veterans were closely aligned, and the only documented incidents show members of the VFW and American Legion spitting on their less successful Vietnam peers. But Lembcke's most controversial conclusion is that posttraumatic stress disorder was as much a political creation?a means of discrediting returning vets who protested the war as unhinged?as it was a medical condition. The image of the psycho-vet was furthered through such Hollywood productions as The Deer Hunter and Coming Home. This forceful investigation challenges the reader to reexamine assumptions about the dark side of American culture that glorifies war more than peace. Highly recommended for large public libraries and for all academic peace studies collections.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Spitting-Image-Memory-Vietnam/dp/product-description/0814751474/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books Editorial reviews - The Spitting Image]; Amazon Books - Product Overview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lembcke's debunking of the spitting stories is quite persuasive. But he has much broader aims. Not only was there no spitting, he argues, but there was no hostility or tension at all between veterans and protesters. In fact, he characterizes their relationship as "empathetic and mutually supporting." It is certainly true that a remarkable number of veterans opposed the war, and that the antiwar movement did forge alliances with veterans. It is also true that American culture has given too little in-depth attention to antiwar veterans. But Lembcke insists on a strict either/or argument: Veterans and peaceniks were either enemies or comrades. "Antiwar activists could not have been spitting on veterans while at the same time befriending them in off-base coffeehouses," he writes. [...] My own view is that the spitting stories are largely mythic, but that the myth itself reflects the deep anger and animosity that many veterans harbored toward the antiwar movement. Their anger often reflected a sense of class injustice that gave their more privileged peers greater freedom to avoid the war. [...] I base my conclusions on extensive interviews I have conducted with Vietnam veterans since the early 1980s. Lembcke, however, gives no credence to the possibility that veterans themselves played a role in creating the myth of antiwar spitters, or that the myth teaches us anything meaningful about the class and wartime experiences of veterans. For him, the myth is almost entirely a product of Hollywood and right-wing politicians.&lt;ref name="Appy"&gt;[http://www.wright.edu/~tdung/vn.htm The Muffling of Public Memory in Post-Vietnam America]; ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''; February 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\

[[David Dellinger]] review:
:"The best history I have seen on the impact of the war on Americans, both then and now."&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;

Mary Carroll, [[Booklist]] review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, Holy Cross College sociology professor Lembcke can't prove a negative, but he makes a strong case that tales of antiwar activists spitting at returning vets are myth. Lembcke, a Nam vet who was active in Vietnam Veterans Against the War, opens with Persian Gulf War politicians' use of "the spitting image" and then traces Nixon and Agnew's agitated response to antiwar activism by GIs and veterans. He notes that contemporary media, government, and polling data show no evidence of antiwar spitting incidents; the few events reported had supporters of the war targeting opponents. But later studies reported hostility toward veterans; "the spitting image" epitomized that narrative. Similar images were common in post-World War I Germany and France after Indochina; Lembcke suggests the Nixon administration cultivated this notion of betrayal because it stigmatized both the antiwar movement and veterans against the war. With development of a new psychiatric diagnosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, a good vet/bad vet split was complete, and Hollywood films shifted attention from the war itself to its GI victims.&lt;ref name="Amazon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lembcke builds a compelling case against collective memory by demonstrating that remembrances of Vietnam were almost at direct odds with circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name="NYU Press"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3532">'''Thomas Childers''' is a [[historian]] and has taught in the Department of History at the University of Pennsylvania since 1976.

Childers was born in [[Tennessee]] where he was raised and later attended the [[University of Tennessee]] where he received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees. He gained his PH.D. in History in 1976 from [[Harvard University]]. Dr. Childers focuses much of his expertise on War and Society in the Twentieth Century and [[World War#World War I and World War II|World War I and II]].

He has received several teaching awards including the Ira T. Abrahms Award in 1987 for Distinguish Teaching and Challenging Teaching in the Arts and Sciences, and the Richard S. Dunn Award for Distinguished Teaching in History. While teaching at the University of Pennsylvania Dr. Childers has taken many Visiting Professorships at well-known colleges such as the [[University of Cambridge]], [[Swarthmore College]], and [[Trinity Hall College]]. He has also done many lectures throughout the world in places like Oxford, Berlin, Munich, and London. Dr. Childers's work has been talked about by other historians. Some of those acknowledgements can be found in the book ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century from Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge'' written by Georg G. Iggers. For example, Iggers states “Thomas Childers concentrates more directly on language.” (Iggers 1997)

Childers has lectured on four of [[The Great Courses]] series.

}}

A '''two-cube calendar''' is a [[desk calendar]] consisting of two [[cube]]s with faces marked by [[Arabic numerals|digits 0 through 9]]. Each face of each cube is marked with a single digit, and it is possible to arrange the cubes so that any chosen day of the month (from 01, 02, ... through 31) is visible on the two front faces.

A puzzle about the two-cube calendar was described in [[Martin Gardner|Gardner]]'s column in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref name="circus_p186"&gt;Gardner, Mathematical Circus, 1992, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="antonick" /&gt; In the puzzle discussed in ''Mathematical Circus'' (1992), two visible faces of one cube have digits 1 and 2 on them, and three visible faces of another cube have digits 3, 4, 5 on them. The cubes are arranged so that their front faces indicate the 25th day of the current month. The problem is to determine digits hidden on the seven invisible faces.&lt;ref name="circus_p186" /&gt;

Gardner wrote he saw a two-cube desk calendar in a store window in New York.&lt;ref name="circus_p186" /&gt; According to a letter received by Gardner from John&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Singleton (England), Singleton patented the calendar in 1957,&lt;ref name="GB831572a" /&gt; but the patent lapsed in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Mathematical Circus, 1992, pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, 2010, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation with three cubes providing English abbreviations for the twelve [[Gregorian calendar#Months of the year|months]] is discussed in a ''Scientific American'' column in December 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Mathematical Circus, 1992, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; One solution of this variation allows displaying the first three letters of any month and relies on the fact that lower-case letters ''u'' and ''n'' and also ''p'' and ''d'' are inverses of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A number of variations are manufactured and sold as [[souvenir]]s, differing in the appearance and the existence of additional bars to set the current month.

'''Ursul Philip Boissevain''' (4 November 1855 &amp;ndash; 7 May 1930) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[historian]] and [[professor]].&lt;ref name="jaarboek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hesseling|first1=D.C.|title=Levensbericht U.Ph.

==Biography==
[[Boissevain]] was born in [[Amsterdam]] as the fifth and youngest son of Henri Jean Arnaud Boissevain and Petronella Drost.&lt;ref name="genealogieonline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stamboom Boissevain|url=https://www.genealogieonline.nl/stamboom-boissevain/|website=Genealogie Online|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after Ursuline Philippine Baroness of Verschuer (1794-1866), wife of [[theologian]] [[Hermann Friedrich Kohlbrugge]]. He studied in [[Leiden]] where  he wrote his [[dissertation]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/de-re-militari-provinciarum-hispaniarum-aetate-imperatoria/oclc/43204705&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat], U. Ph. Boissevain, ''De re militari provinciarum hispaniarum aetate imperatoria'' Thesis (D. Phil.)--University of Leiden, 1879; Amstelodami : J.H. &amp; G. Van Heteren, 1879&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied in [[Berlin]]. After his studies Boissevain traveled through Europe and lived in [[Italy]] for a number of years. In 1882 he started teaching classical languages at the Erasmus Gymnasium in [[Rotterdam]]. Two years later Boissevain married Wilhelmina Carolina Momma (1859 &amp;ndash; 1921).

'''Walter Harris''' (1686–1761) was an Anglo-Irish historian and writer.

==Life==
Harris was educated at [[Kilkenny College]] and [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], Dublin. He married Elizabeth Ware, great-granddaughter of [[James Ware (historian)|Sir James Ware]], the historian, in 1716 and became vicar-general to the [[Bishop of Meath|Archbishop of Meath]] in 1753.

Harris received a government pension in 1748, which enabled him to work on histories and religious writings. In the 1740s he was involved with the Physico-Historical Society, a similar society to the [[Royal Dublin Society]], along with such luminaries as [[Earl of Roden|Robert Jocelyn]], Dr. [[Samuel Madden]], the philanthropist; Thomas Prior, the founder of the [[Royal Dublin Society]]; [[John Rutty]] the physician and naturalist; John Lodge, author of ''Peerage of Ireland''; [[Charles Smith (topographer)|Charles Smith]], the topographer and historian.

Harris died at his house in Clarendon St., Dublin, in 1761.

==Works==
In the 1730s, along with others of his time, Harris supported a scheme to compile and publish histories of all Irish counties. He also started to revise and republish the historical and topographical writings of Sir James Ware, translating them from Latin to English. The first to be published was ''Historiographorum Aliorumque Scriptorum Hiberniae Commentarium: or, a history of the Irish writers'' (Dublin, 1736). To increase the attractiveness of these books he commissioned from [[Jonas Blaymire]] drawings of buildings and their contents.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Strickland, ''A dictionary of Irish artists'&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1752 in a book published in Dublin he bitterly attacked a book by [[John Curry (historian)|John Curry]] published in London in 1747, a ''Brief Account from the most authentic Protestant writers of the Irish Rebellion, 1641'', which was against partisan anti-Catholic history. In reply Curry published his ''Historical Memoirs'', afterwards enlarged and published in 1775 under the title ''An Historical and Critical Review of the Civil Wars in Ireland''.

In 1766 his work ''The history and antiquities of the city of Dublin'' was published.

'''Walter Quin''' (1575?–1640) was an Irish poet who worked in Scotland and England for the [[House of Stuart]].

==Ireland==
Born about 1575 in Dublin, nothing is known of Quin's early life before he travelled to study law at the Jesuit [[University of Ingolstadt]] in Germany around 1590. Although Quin referred to his Dublin origins in his work, his Irish family cannot be identified. The Stuarts rewarded him with property in Ireland, but there is no direct evidence that he returned to his native country. Quin wrote in English, Latin, French, and Italian, a polyglot combination that was a hallmark of his output. He is one of the earliest modern Irish writers to have had original work printed in English and of this small group he is notable for producing several (albeit slim) volumes that included works of court poetry, history, biography and philosophy.&lt;ref name="park"/&gt;

==Scotland==
Having, for unknown reasons moved to the Calvinist [[University of St Andrews]] in Scotland, in 1595 Quin was presented to [[James VI]], who was charmed with his manner and his verse. He further recommended himself to the king's favour by giving him some poetic ''[[Anagrams]]'' of his own composition that were based on James's name in four languages. The good impression which Quin made was confirmed by his presenting the king, on New Year's Day 1596, with an oration about his title to the English throne, a subject that was increasingly controversial as [[Elizabeth I]] grew older and yet had no official heir. The political implications of his poetry led to Quin's appearances at court being tracked by the English agents of Sir [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] who was sent a copy of Quin's ''Anagrams'' in 1600.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;John Flood ed., ''The Works of Walter Quin: An Irishman at the Stuart Courts'', Dublin, Four Courts Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this controversy, the Edinburgh printer, [[Robert Waldegrave]], refused, to print a book on the subject which Quin prepared in February 1598. He was at the time reported to be "answering Spenser's book, whereat the king is offended".&lt;ref&gt;The reference is to the fourth book of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]],'' where the king's mother, [[Mary Queen of Scots]], was denounced under the name of Duessa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Quin had been taken into the service of James VI as tutor to his sons, and he gave proof of his loyalty by publishing, in 1600, ''Sertum Poeticum in honorem Jacobi Sexti''&lt;ref&gt;Walter Quin, ''Sertum Poeticum in honorem Jacobi Sexti serenissimi ac potentissimi Scotorum Regis. A Gualtero Quinno Dubliniensi contextum'', Edinburgh, Robert Waldegrave, 1600.&lt;/ref&gt; The volume consists of some of Quin's early anagrams on the king's name, with Latin odes and epigrams, and English sonnets, addressed to members of the royal family and the rescuers of James VI during the [[Gowrie Conspiracy]]. An extravagant sonnet on Sir [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] (afterwards Earl of Stirling) appeared in the first edition of the latter's ''Tragedie of Darius'' (1603). In 1604 Quin celebrated the marriage of Sir William with an [[epithalamium]] and two sonnets.

==England==
Quin migrated with king James to England in 1603 where he was employed as a music teacher in the household of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref name="park"/&gt; As part of the prince's circle Quin contributed Italian verses "In lode del autore" to [[Thomas Coryat]]'s ''[[Odcombian Banquet]]'' (1611). In common with many other poets of the time, he lamented his young patron's death; these elegies were printed in [[Joshua Sylvester]]'s ''Lachrymæ Lachrymarum'' (1612).&lt;ref&gt;Two of these poems were reissued in ''Mausoleum'', Edinburgh, Andro Hart, 1613.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quin subsequently became a tutor to Prince [[Charles I of England|Charles]]. For Charles's use he compiled ''Corona Virtutum principe dignarum ex varijs Philosophorum, Historicorum, Oratorum, et Poetarum'' (1603), a neo-Stoic florelegium on virtue culled from the work of [[Justus Lipsius]] with accounts of the lives and virtues of [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Quin, ''Corona Virtutum principe dignarum ex varijs Philosophorum, Historicorum, Oratorum, et Poetarum floribus contexta et concinnata'', London, John Bill, 1613, 1617. This was reissued at Leyden in 1634, and appeared in Stephen de Melle's ''Syntagma Philosophicum'', Paris, 1670, v. 336–481.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Memorie of the most worthy and renowned Bernard Stuart, Lord D'Aubigni, renewed'' (1619), Quin produced a biography of [[Bernard Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny]], a Franco-Scottish hero who he believed was unduly neglected despite his importance to military affairs in France, Italy, and England (where he had fought for [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]]).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Quin, ''The Memorie of the most worthy and renowned Bernard Stuart, Lord D'Aubigni, renewed. Whereunto are added Wishes presented to the Prince at his Creation'', London, George Purslow, 1619.&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface, Quin states that he had collected materials in French for a prose life of his hero but they proved inadequate for his purpose so ''A Short Collection of the most Notable Places of Histories'' is appended, together with a series of poems addressed to Prince Charles.

On Charles I's marriage to [[Henrietta Maria]] in 1625 Quin published ''In Nuptiis Principum incomparabilium'', congratulatory verses in Latin, English, French, and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Quin, ''In Nuptiis Principum incomparabilium, Caroli Britannici Imperii Monarchæ … et Henriettæ Mariæ Gratulatio quadrilinguis'', London, George Purslow, 1625.&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriately, French poetry was to the fore for a French bride and Quin rejoiced in the union of the rose of England with the lily of France. Around this time he returned to historical biography with a French prose account of the memorable sayings of [[Henri IV]], the new queen's father.&lt;ref&gt;Now London, British Library MS Royal 16 E XLI (manuscript).&lt;/ref&gt; This was Quin's last extended work. Ten Latin lines signed "Walt. O—Quin Armig." are prefixed to Sir [[Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet|Thomas Herbert]]'s ''Travels'' (1634). Quin died in London in 1640.

==Family==
Another son of Quin's, James (1621–1659), born in Middlesex, obtained a scholarship at Westminster, and was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1639. He graduated B.A. in 1642, and M.A. in 1646, and was elected a senior student. As an avowed royalist he was ejected from this position by the [[Parliamentary visitation of the University of Oxford|parliamentary visitors]] in 1648. [[Anthony à Wood]], who was acquainted with him, often heard him "sing with great admiration." His voice was a bass, "the best in England, and he had great command of it … but he wanted skill, and could scarce sing in consort." He contrived to obtain an introduction to Cromwell, who was so delighted with his musical talent that, "after liquoring him with sack," he restored him to his place at Christ Church. But in 1651 he was reported to be insane and he died in October 1659 and was buried in the cathedral of Christ Church. James Quin contributed to the Oxford University collections of Latin verse issued on the return of the king from Scotland in 1641, and on the peace with the Dutch Republic in 1654.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Quin, Walter|last=Lee|first=Sidney|authorlink=|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese name|[[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]]}}

'''Zhang Qinqiu''' ({{zh|s=张琴秋}}; November 15, 1904 – April 22, 1968) was a Chinese Communist revolutionary, military commander, and politician. She was one of the first female members of the [[Communist Party of China]], and one of the [[28 Bolsheviks]] trained in Moscow. A high-ranking commander of the Fourth Front Army of the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army|Chinese Red Army]] during the [[Long March]], she is often considered the only woman general of the Red Army. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, she served as Deputy Minister of Textile Industry. She was persecuted during the [[Cultural Revolution]] and committed suicide in 1968.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Zhang Qinqiu and Shen Zemin.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Wedding photo of Zhang Qinqiu and Shen Zemin]]
On 15 November 1904, Zhang Qinqiu was born to an affluent family in Shimen, [[Tongxiang]], [[Zhejiang]] Province. She entered Hangzhou Girls Normal School (now [[Hangzhou No. 14 High School]]) in 1920, before going to [[Shanghai]] for further education. In Shanghai she met the famous novelist [[Mao Dun]] (Shen Yanbing), who was married to Zhang's elementary school classmate Kong Dezhi, and his younger brother [[Shen Zemin]], one of the earliest members of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).&lt;ref name=helibo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper81/8254/778150.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030218042808/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper81/8254/778150.html|archivedate=18 February 2003|script-title=zh:红军唯一的女将领张琴秋 |trans-title=Zhang Qinqiu, the only woman commander of the Red Army |author=He Libo |work=People's Daily |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Zhang entered the [[sociology]] department of the left-wing [[Shanghai University]], where Shen Zemin was an instructor and the early Communist leader [[Qu Qiubai]] was the department head. Zhang joined the CPC in November 1924, becoming one of the first female CPC members. She married Shen Zemin a year later.&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt; Under the leadership of [[Xiang Jingyu]], Zhang and other women students established a night school for women workers in Shanghai, and organized a strike of silk workers in 1924. She also recruited some of the workers into the CPC.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=76}}

In November 1925, the CPC sent more than 100 party members, including Zhang Qinqiu, to study at [[Moscow Sun Yat-sen University]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. Shen Zemin joined her soon afterwards. In May 1926, she gave birth to a daughter named Zhang Maya (张玛娅).&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt;
In [[Moscow]], Zhang and Shen became members of the [[28 Bolsheviks]], which included future CPC leaders [[Wang Ming]], [[Bo Gu]], [[Zhang Wentian]], and [[Yang Shangkun]].{{sfn|Kampen|2000|p=25}} She became proficient in Russian after two years of study, and worked as an interpreter for the CPC. She also worked in textile mills to learn production and management methods.{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=689}}

==Military career==
In 1930, Zhang and Shen returned to China, leaving their daughter in Moscow. In January 1931, when Wang Ming became the leader of the CPC, Shen Zemin was elected to the [[6th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|6th CPC Central Committee]] and appointed propaganda chief of the CPC. In 1931, Shen and Zhang went to the Communist base in the border region of [[Hubei]], [[Henan]] and [[Anhui]] (E-Yu-Wan) Provinces, which was under the leadership of [[Zhang Guotao]].&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt;{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=689}}

After being attacked by the 200,000-strong Kuomintang forces in the [[Encirclement Campaigns]], the E-Yu-Wan [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army|Red Army]] decided to abandon the base and break out of the encirclement to [[Sichuan]]-[[Shaanxi]] region in the west. Shen Zemin, who suffered from lung disease, insisted on remaining at the base. He died in November 1933.&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt; In November 1932, Zhang Qinqiu was appointed Director of the General Political Department of the Fourth Front Army, the highest war-time position ever held by a woman in the Chinese Communist army.{{sfn|King|2010|p=144}} She is often called the only woman general of the Red Army.&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt;

In March 1934, Zhang was appointed Commander and [[Political Commissar]] of the Women's Independent Regiment of the Fourth Front Army,&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt; commanding 2,000 women soldiers.{{sfn|King|2010|p=128}} In 1935, she joined the [[Long March]] under the command of Zhang Guotao. In 1936, she married [[Chen Changhao]], political commissar of the Fourth Front Army and another member of the 28 Bolsheviks.&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt; In October, 20,000 soldiers of the Fourth Front Army were split into the Western Route Army and arrived in the [[Hexi Corridor]] of [[Gansu]] Province. The Western Route Army was surrounded and defeated by the forces of the [[Ma clique]] then in control of Gansu. Zhang, who had just given birth to a baby who had to be abandoned, was captured and sent to the capital [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt;&lt;ref name=mzb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzb.com.cn/html/Home/report/291090-2.htm |script-title=zh:张琴秋：未授衔的女将军 |author=Mu Wangjun |language=Chinese |work=Lanzhou Evening News |date=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Xi'an Incident]] in December 1936, the Kuomintang government and the Communist rebels suspended their civil war and formed the [[Second United Front]] to resist the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]]. Zhang was released and sent to [[Yan'an]], the de facto capital of the Communists.{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=691}}&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt; As more people arrived in Yan'an from areas occupied by Japan, the Chinese Women's University was established and Zhang became its dean. Her husband Chen Changhao had in 1938 gone to the Soviet Union for medical treatment, where he later lived with a Russian woman. Zhang divorced Chen in 1943, and married her third husband Su Jingguan, an army doctor.{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=692}} She was a member of the Women's Committee of the Central Committee of the CPC in the 1940s, and attended the Second International Federation of Democratic Women of 1948 in [[Budapest]].{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=692}}

==People's Republic of China==
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Zhang was appointed Vice Minister of Textile Industry, partly because of her earlier experience of organizing textile workers in Shanghai in the 1920s.{{sfn|Lee|2004|p=76}} Her husband Su Jingguan (died 1964) was appointed Vice Minister of Public Health.{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=692}} As a civilian, she did not receive a military rank when the [[People's Liberation Army]] first awarded them in 1955, even though many of her former subordinates, including [[Chen Geng]], [[Xu Shiyou]], [[Hong Xuezhi]], and [[Liu Huaqing]], were awarded the rank of general or [[Da jiang|grand general]].&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt;

When the [[Cultural Revolution]] began in 1966, Zhang and her family members were severely persecuted. In April 1968, she committed suicide by jumping from the balcony of her office.{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=692}} Her ex-husband Chen Changhao also killed himself.{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=692}} In 1976, her daughter Zhang Maya committed suicide by drug overdose.{{sfn|Lee|Stefanowska|2003|p=692}}&lt;ref name=mzb/&gt;

After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Zhang was posthumously rehabilitated. In June 1979, Marshal [[Xu Xiangqian]], her former comrade in the Fourth Front Army, held a memorial ceremony for her, which was attended by [[Li Xiannian]], [[Wang Zhen (general)|Wang Zhen]], [[Yu Qiuli]], [[Chen Xilian]] and [[Hu Yaobang]].&lt;ref name=helibo/&gt;
