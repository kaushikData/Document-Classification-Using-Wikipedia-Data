'''Calf 269''' is a [[bull]] (still alive today{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}) who was rescued as a calf by anonymous activists, days before his planned slaughter.  He was born at an [[Israel]]i facility in the vicinity of [[Azor]], a town on the outskirts of [[Tel Aviv]]. The slaughter was scheduled for June 2013.&lt;ref name="Haaretz-20130321"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/the-israeli-calf-that-started-a-mass-tattoo-movement.premium-1.511045|title=The Israeli calf that started a mass tattoo movement|last=Ahituv|first=Netta|date=2013-03-21|work=Haaretz|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as sweet-tempered and white-headed, and his ear carried a tag numbered 269, indicating he was destined for slaughter.&lt;ref name="Haaretz-20121112" /&gt; The Israeli protests regarding the calf were followed by protests in the U.K. and other places across the world. The protests aimed at conveying that animal parts eaten as food by humans once belonged to a living individual, who lived a tortured life and faced a brutal death, after which his or her carcass was processed into human food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official "269 life" Facebook page – about|url=https://www.facebook.com/269calf/info|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of the event led to the creation of "''269 life''", an animal liberation movement founded in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=269 life on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/269_life|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli protests==
On the occasion of World Farm Animals Day, ([[Gandhi]]'s birthday) 2 October 2012, two Israelis, Zohar Gorelik and Sasha Boojor, and one Russian activist, Oleg Ozerov, had the number 269 [[Human branding|branded]] on their skin with a hot-iron branding tool. [[Haaretz]] reports that this branding was an act of fellowship with Calf 269. The branding incident took place at Tel Aviv's Rabin square. The action is considered an attempt to bring to light the mistreatment of animals in the farming sector. According to Haaretz the treatment of animals would require terminologies applied to the [[Holocaust]] in order to adequately describe the situation.&lt;ref name="Haaretz-20121112"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/slaughterhouse-269.premium-1.477140|title=Slaughterhouse 269|last=Ranet|first=Oma|date=2012-11-12|work=Haaretz|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Netta Ahituv writing in the Haaretz, the calf's story has inspired a worldwide tattoo movement. At least a thousand individuals have had themselves branded or tattooed with the number 269. In a testimony a tattooed individual who was a tow truck driver narrated that the tattoo reminded one passenger of his grandmother's stories of  [[Nazi concentration camps|German concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz-20130321" /&gt; The website ''269life.com''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.269life.com/#&amp;panel1-1|title=269 Life|publisher=269life.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created by Boojor following this protest. The protests were an attempt to end the anonymity of millions of animals butchered for human consumption. The website declares, "This anonymous male calf will be forever immortalized on our bodies, and hopefully this message of solidarity will somehow bring a new way of looking at non-human animals."&lt;ref name="GreenProphet-20130404"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2013/04/animal-rights-activists-269/|title=269life Activists Etch and Burn White Calf Branding Number Into Skin|last=Laylin|first=Tafline|date=2013-04-04|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests in the United Kingdom==
In the U.K., campaigners, motivated by this action of the Israelis, decided to brand themselves on their chest with the number 269.&lt;ref name="DC-20130123"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130131/lifestyle-health-workplace/article/where-are-people-being-branded|title=Where are people being branded?|date=2013-01-23|work=The Deccan Chronicle |accessdate=10 April 2013}} {{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This took place in front of a [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] outlet in [[Leeds]] a day before their scheduled protest at the Leeds city centre. One protester was jailed, the police allegedly took away cameras and erased memory cards. A protester who was interviewed justified the protest as a reaction to the extreme cruelty perpetrated by the [[dairy farming|dairy industry]] such as shooting calves at birth.&lt;ref name="Vice-20130410"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/vegans-are-branding-themselves-in-solidarity-with-cows|title=Vegans are branding their flesh in Leeds|last= Starke|first=Jonathan|work=Vice|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protests in London were organised by Becky Folkard. Folkard said that although the protest might be considered extreme, other methods such as fastening oneself to railings and stopping horses by standing in their way were used by women to force authorities to give them a [[Women's suffrage|right to vote]]. [[PETA]]'s spokesperson in a statement of support pointed that the suffering endured by non-human animals such as cows, chickens or pigs when they are branded, have their testicles, beaks or horns cut, is no less than that of humans in a similar situation.&lt;ref name="IBT-20130113"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/426218/20130121/becky-folkard-vegan-branding-269-volunteers-london.htm|title=Animal Rights Activists to Brand Volunteers Like Cattle Using Red Hot Iron|last=Osborne|first=Hannah|date=2013-01-21|work=International Business Times|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folkard said that the protests would be considered worthwhile even if one person turned vegan in reaction.&lt;ref name="MailOnline-20130119"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2265109/The-woman-bringing-horror-human-branding-Britain-Vegan-mark-volunteer-hot-iron-protest-animal-cruelty.html|title=The woman bringing horror of 'human branding' to Britain: Vegan to mark volunteer with hot iron in protest against animal cruelty |last=McFarlane|first=Jo|date=2013-01-19|work=Mail Online|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folkard's planned protests have been described as a disturbing community agitation opposing barbarity inflicted on industrial dairy animals.&lt;ref name="Mirror-20130121"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/animal-rights-activists-will-be-branded-with-a-red-1547258|title=Burning issue: Volunteers will be branded with a red hot iron to highlight animal rights abuses |last=Shaw|first=Adrian|date=2013-01-21|work=Mirror Online|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26, 2015 another hot-iron branding was held in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/animal-activists-endure-hot-iron-10150972|title= Animal activists endure hot iron branding in front of shocked Birmingham shoppers|last=Lockley|first=Mike|date=2015-09-28|work=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from animal farmers==
Joseph Keating, life-stock adviser of the National Farmers Union is quoted in a Guardian story as expressing surprise in response to the English protests. According to Keating, branding of animals has been banned in England for many years.&lt;ref name="Guardian-20130121"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2013/jan/21/human-branding-animal-rights-stunt|title=Is human branding an animal-rights stunt too far?|last=Hickman|first=Leo|date=January 21, 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''collapse of Block 7 at Lotus Riverside''' (a 13-story apartment building) in 2009 is an accident that killed one person.

==Lotus Riverside==
Lotus Riverside ({{zh|s=莲花河畔景苑|t=蓮花河畔景苑|p=lián huā hé pàn jǐng yuàn}}) is a residential apartment complex located in [[Minhang District]], [[Shanghai]], [[China]].&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lotus Riverside.jpg|thumb|right|Lotus Riverside Toppled]] --&gt;

==Events==
On June 27, 2009 at 5:30 Am UTC+8, Block 7, one of the eleven 13-story buildings of the apartment complex, collapsed, killing one worker named Xiao Dekun.

==Explanations==
According to the Wall Street Journal, which referenced Shanghai Daily:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"According to [[Shanghai Daily]], initial investigations attribute the accident to the excavations for the construction of a garage under the collapsed building. Large quantities of earth were removed and dumped in a landfill next to a nearby creek; the weight of the earth caused the river bank to collapse, which, in turn, allowed water to seep into the ground, creating a muddy foundation for the building that toppled."&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2009/06/29/shanghai-building-collapses-nearly-intact/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Countersurveillance''' refers to measures undertaken to prevent [[surveillance]], including [[covert surveillance]]. Countersurveillance may include electronic methods such as [[technical surveillance counter-measures|'''bug sweeping''']], the process of detecting [[surveillance device]]s, including [[covert listening device]]s, visual surveillance devices as well as countersurveillance software to thwart unwanted attempts by cyber crooks to access computing and mobile devices for various nefarious reasons (e.g. theft of financial, personal or corporate data). More often than not, countersurveillance will employ a set of actions (countermeasures) that, when followed, reduce the risk of surveillance. Countersurveillance should not be confused with [[sousveillance]] (inverse surveillance) as the latter does not necessarily aim to prevent or reduce surveillance.

==Types of Countersurveillance==
===Technical surveillance counter-measures===
====Electronic countermeasures====

Most bugs emit some form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], usually [[radio wave]]s. The standard counter-measure for bugs is therefore to "sweep" for them with a receiver, looking for the radio emissions. Professional sweeping devices are very expensive. Low-tech sweeping devices are available through amateur electrical [[magazine]]s, or they may be built from circuit designs on the [[Internet]].

Sweeping is not foolproof. Advanced bugs can be remotely operated to switch on and off, and some even rapidly switch frequencies according to a predetermined pattern in order to make location with sweepers more difficult. A bug that has run out of power may not show up during a sweep, which means that the sweeper will not be alerted to the surveillance.  Also some devices have no active parts, an example is the Great Seal given to the US Ambassador to Moscow which hid a device (the [[Thing (listening device)|Thing]]).

====Software countermeasures====
Amidst concerns over privacy, [[software]] countermeasures&lt;ref&gt;International Association of Privacy Professionals. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f5hQ4OSxmg "The Family of Technologies That Could Change The Privacy Dynamic"], presented by Daniel Wietzner, Director MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, uploaded July 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; have emerged to prevent cyber-intrusion, the un-authorized act of spying, snooping, and stealing [[personally identifiable information]] or other proprietary assets (e.g. images) through [[cyberspace]].

Popular interest in Countersurveillance and has been growing given media coverage of [[privacy]] violations:&lt;ref&gt;Roose, Kevin.

====Human countermeasures====
:''For main article, see [[Counterintelligence]]''

Most surveillance, and most countersurveillance, involves human rather than electronic methods since people are generally more vulnerable and more capable of reacting creatively to surveillance situations.

Human [[Countermeasure|countermeasures]] include:
* Evasion: avoiding risky locations, being discreet or circumspect, using code words
* Being 'situation-aware' (looking over-your-shoulder)
* Leaving the area without being seen or followed e.g. getting 'lost in the crowd' so that followers lose contact
* Hiding in secure locations
* Concealing ones identity 

Such activities make it harder to track surveillance subjects. Following steady, easy-to-predict schedules before employing aforementioned countermeasures may make the surveillance detail complacent and thus easier to lose.

==Countersurveillance by countries==
:''See [[List of counterintelligence organizations]]''

===United States===
'''TSCM''' ('''technical surveillance counter-measures''') is the original [[United States of America|United States]] Federal government [[abbreviation]] denoting the process of [[covert listening device|bug]]-sweeping or electronic [[countersurveillance]]. It is related to [[ELINT]], [[SIGINT]] and [[electronic countermeasures]] (ECM).

The [[United States Department of Defense]] defines a TSCM survey as a service provided by qualified personnel to detect the presence of technical [[surveillance]] devices and hazards and to identify technical security weaknesses that could aid in the conduct of a technical penetration of the surveyed facility.  A TSCM survey will provide a professional evaluation of the facility's technical security posture and normally will consist of a thorough visual, electronic, and physical examination in and about the surveyed facility.

This definition is however lacking some of the technical scope involved. COMSEC (communications security), ITSEC  (information technology security) and physical security are also a major part of the work in the modern environment. The advent of multimedia devices and remote control technologies allow huge scope for removal of massive amounts of data in very secure environments by the staff employed within, with or without their knowledge.

Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM) can best be defined as The systematic physical and electronic examination of a designated area by properly trained, qualified and equipped persons in an attempt to discover electronic eavesdropping devices, security hazards or security weaknesses.

====Methodology====

=====Radio frequencies=====
Most bugs transmit information, whether data, video, or voice, through the air by using radio waves. The standard counter-measure for bugs of this nature is to search for such an attack with a [[radio frequency]] (RF) receiver. Lab and even field-quality receivers are very expensive and a good, working knowledge of RF theory is needed to operate the equipment effectively. 
Counter-measures like [[burst transmission]] and [[spread spectrum]] make detection more difficult.

The timing of detection surveys and location scans is critical to success, and varies with the type of location being scanned. For permanent facilities, scans and surveys must take place during working hours to detect remotely switchable devices that are turned off during non-working hours to defeat detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braunig|first1=Martha J.|title=The Executive Protection Bible|date=1993|publisher=ESI Education Development Corporation|location=Aspen, Colorado|isbn=0-9640627-0-4|page=147|edition=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Devices that do not emit radio waves=====

Instead of transmitting conversations, bugs may record them. Bugs that do not emit radio waves are very difficult to detect, though there are a number of options for detecting such bugs.

Very sensitive equipment could be used to look for [[magnetic field]]s, or for the characteristic [[electrical noise]] emitted by the computerized technology in [[digital tape recorder]]s; however, if the place being monitored has many [[computer]]s, [[photocopier]]s, or other pieces of [[electrical equipment]] installed, it may become very difficult. Items such as audio recorders can be very difficult to detect using electronic equipment. Most of these items will be discovered through a physical search.

Another method is using very sensitive [[thermal camera]]s to detect residual heat of a bug, or power supply, that may be concealed in a wall or ceiling. The device is found by locating a hot spot the device generates that can be detected by the thermal camera.

A method does exist to find hidden recorders, as these typically use a well known frequency for the clock which can never be totally shielded. A combination of existing techniques and resonance sweeps can often pick up even a defunct or "dead" bug in this way by measuring recent changes in the electromagnetic spectrum.

====Technology used====
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Technology most commonly used for a bug sweep includes but is not limited to:
&lt;!-- New links in alphabetical order please --&gt;
* Broadband receivers to detect radiating hostile radio frequency transmissions in the near field.
* [[Flashlight]] one of the most important tools to have beside a ladder for providing a competent sweep.
* [[Scanner (radio)|Frequency scanner]] with a range of [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s and [[electronic filter|filter]]s for checking the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] for signals that should not be there.
* GSM detection equipment
* WiFi and broadband detection equipment
* Lens detectors to detect the lenses of wired or wireless concealed covert cameras.
* [[Multimeter]]s for general measurements of power supplies and device components.
* [[Nonlinear junction detector]] (NLJD) to detect components associated with hidden eavesdropping devices.
* [[Oscilloscope]] for visualisation of signals.
* [[Spectrum analyzer]] and [[vector signal analyzer]] for more advanced analysis of threatening and non threatening RF signals.
* [[Thermography|Thermal imagers]] to help find hot spots and areas higher in temperature than the ambient area temperature. Finds heat generated from active electronic components.
* [[Time-domain reflectometer]] (TDR) for testing the integrity of copper telephone lines and other communication cables.
* [[Tool]]s for manual disassembling of objects and walls in order to visually check their content. This is the most important, most laborious, least glamorous and hence most neglected part of a check.
* [[Videoscope|Videoscopes]] to inspect small or inaccessible spaces, such as wall spaces, HVAC components, vehicle crevices, etc.
* Portable [[x-ray]] machine for checking the inside of objects and walls.

=== Canada ===
In 2011, Defence Minister [[Peter MacKay]] authorized a program to search telephone and internet usage for suspicious activities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/data-collection-program-got-green-light-from-mackay-in-2011/article12444909/#dashboard/follows/ https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/data-collection-program-got-green-light-from-mackay-in-2011/article12444909
&lt;/ref&gt; This program searches for and collects meta-data of Canadians across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/06/10/nsa-surveillance-canada-_n_3416730.html|title=Confirmed: Canada Has NSA-Style Surveillance Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canadian Movements ====
There are minimal anti-surveillance movements specifically targeted in Canada at present.

Transparent Lives is a prominent Canadian organization that aims to "demonstrate dramatically just how visible we have all become to myriad organizations and what this means—for better or for worse—for how we conduct our everyday lives." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome {{!}} Transparent Lives|url = http://www.surveillanceincanada.org|website = www.surveillanceincanada.org|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International movements currently active In Canada ====
[[Amnesty International]] runs a campaign called #UnfollowMe that "calls on governments to ban mass surveillance and unlawful intelligence sharing", inspired by Edward Snowden leaking thousands of NSA documents that revealed information about [[mass surveillance in the United States|mass surveillance in the U.S.]] This campaign is active worldwide.

'''Cyberstalking''' is the use of the [[Internet]] or other electronic means to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[harass]] an individual, group, or organization.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Cyberstalking |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cyberstalking |dictionary=Oxford University Press |access-date=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may include [[false accusations]], [[defamation]], [[slander]] and [[libel]]. It may also include monitoring, [[identity theft]], threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or [[Doxing|gathering information]] that may be used to threaten, embarrass or harass.

Cyberstalking is often accompanied by realtime or offline stalking.&lt;ref name="gregorystalk"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spitzberg |first1=Brian H. |last2=Hoobler |first2=Gregory |title=Cyberstalking and the technologies of interpersonal terrorism |journal=New Media &amp; Society |date=February 2002 |volume=4 |series=1 |pages=71–92 |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~bsavatar/articles/Cyberstalking-NM&amp;S02.pdf |accessdate=14 June 2011 |doi=10.1177/14614440222226271 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114131647/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~bsavatar/articles/Cyberstalking-NM%26S02.pdf |archivedate=14 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many jurisdictions, such as California, both are criminal offenses.&lt;ref name="digharass"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Kevin|title=Tougher California laws protect victims of digital harassment|url=http://www.sgvtribune.com/technology/20160209/tougher-california-laws-protect-victims-of-digital-harassment|accessdate=3 July 2017|publisher=San Gabriel Valley Tribune|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are motivated by a desire to control, intimidate or influence a victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crime-research.org/library/Cyberstalking.htm Cyberstalking] Crime research&lt;/ref&gt; A stalker may be an online stranger or a person whom the target knows. He may be anonymous and solicit involvement of other people online who do not even know the target.

Cyberstalking is a criminal offense under various state anti-stalking, [[slander]] and [[harassment]] laws. A conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail.

== Definitions and description ==
{{See also|Doxing|Cyberbullying}}
There have been a number of attempts by experts and legislators to define cyberstalking. It is generally understood to be the use of the [[Internet]] or other electronic means to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[harass]] an individual, a group, or an organization.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; Cyberstalking is a form of [[cyberbullying]]; the terms are often used interchangeably in the media. Both may include [[false accusations]], [[defamation]], [[slander]] and [[libel]].&lt;ref name="gregorystalk" /&gt; Cyberstalking may also include monitoring, [[identity theft]], threats, vandalism, solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to threaten or harass. Cyberstalking is often accompanied by real-time or offline stalking.&lt;ref name="gregorystalk"/&gt; Both forms of stalking may be criminal offenses.&lt;ref name="digharass"/&gt;

Stalking is a continuous process, consisting of a series of actions, each of which may be entirely legal in itself. Technology ethics professor Lambèr Royakkers defines cyberstalking as perpetrated by someone without a current relationship with the victim. About the abusive effects of cyberstalking, he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Stalking] is a form of mental assault, in which the perpetrator repeatedly, unwantedly, and disruptively breaks into the life-world of the victim, with whom he has no relationship (or no longer has), with motives that are directly or indirectly traceable to the affective sphere. Moreover, the separated acts that make up the intrusion cannot by themselves cause the mental abuse, but do taken together (cumulative effect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://boalt.org/CCLR/v3/v3royakkers.PDF|format=PDF|author=Lambèr Royakkers|title=The Dutch Approach to Stalking Laws|journal=California Criminal Law Review|volume=3|date=October 2000|accessdate=10 December 2013|via=Sociosite.org ([http://www.sociosite.org/cyberstalking_en.php CyberStalking: Menaced on the Internet])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Distinguishing cyberstalking from other acts ===
It is important{{According to whom|date=May 2017}} to draw a distinction between [[Internet trolling|cyber-trolling]] and cyber-stalking. Research has shown that actions that can be perceived to be harmless as a one-off can be considered to be trolling, whereas if it is part of a persistent campaign then it can be considered stalking.

Cyberstalking author [[Alexis Moore]] separates cyberstalking from identity theft, which is financially motivated.&lt;ref name="alexismooreaboutcyber"/&gt; Her definition, which was also used by the [[Republic of the Philippines]] in their legal description, is as follows:&lt;ref name="govphilippinescyberstalking"/&gt;
{{blockquote|Cyberstalking is a technologically-based "attack" on one person who has been targeted specifically for that attack for reasons of anger, revenge or control. Cyberstalking can take many forms, including: 
#harassment, embarrassment and humiliation of the victim 
#emptying bank accounts or other economic control such as ruining the victim's [[credit score]] 
#harassing family, friends and employers to isolate the victim 
#scare tactics to instill fear and more&lt;ref name="alexismooreaboutcyber"&gt;{{cite news

=== Identification and detection ===
[[CyberAngels]] has written about how to identify cyberstalking:&lt;ref name=Bocij9&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Bocij |title=Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and How to Protect Your Family |publisher=Praeger |year=2004 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When identifying cyberstalking "in the field," and particularly when considering whether to report it to any kind of legal authority, the following features or combination of features can be considered to characterize a true stalking situation: [[:wikt:malice|malice]], premeditation, repetition, [[Distress (medicine)|distress]], [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]], [[Feud|vendetta]], no legitimate purpose, personally directed, disregarded warnings to stop, [[harassment]] and [[threats]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of key factors have been identified in cyberstalking:
{{expand list|date=June 2014}}
* [[False accusations]]: Many cyberstalkers try to damage the reputation of their victim and turn other people against them. They post false information about them on websites. They may set up their own websites, blogs or user pages for this purpose. They post allegations about the victim to newsgroups, chat rooms, or other sites that allow public contributions such as Wikipedia or [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jahitchcock.com/cyberstalked/skippress.htm |title=Fighting Cyberstalking |publisher=ComputerEdge Online |author=Skip Press |accessdate=2013-11-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028014650/http://www.jahitchcock.com/cyberstalked/skippress.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attempts to gather information about the victim: Cyberstalkers may approach their victim's friends, family and work colleagues to obtain personal information. They may advertise for information on the Internet, or hire a private detective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence &amp; Domestic Abuse - Stalking |url=http://www.thewomenscenter.org/content.asp?contentid=555 |publisher=The Women's Center |accessdate=2013-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213210301/http://www.thewomenscenter.org/content.asp?contentid=555 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring their target's online activities and attempting to trace their [[IP address]] in an effort to gather more information about their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1076 |title=An exploration of predatory behavior in cyberspace: Towards a typology of cyberstalkers |author1=Leroy McFarlane |author2=Paul Bocij |publisher=First Monday |volume=8 |issue=9 |date=2003-09-01 |accessdate=2013-11-29 |doi=10.5210/fm.v8i9.1076}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encouraging others to harass the victim: Many cyberstalkers try to involve third parties in the harassment. They may claim the victim has harmed the stalker or his/her family in some way, or may post the victim's name and telephone number in order to encourage others to join the pursuit.
* [[False victimization]]: The cyberstalker will claim that the victim is harassing him or her. Bocij writes that this phenomenon has been noted in a number of well-known cases.&lt;ref name="Bocij2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bocij|first=Paul|title=Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and how to Protect Your Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8NZLBE0sm0C&amp;pg=PA12|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98118-1|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attacks on data and equipment: They may try to damage the victim's computer by sending [[Computer virus|viruses]].
* Ordering goods and services: They order items or subscribe to magazines in the victim's name. These often involve subscriptions to [[pornography]] or ordering sex toys then having them delivered to the victim's workplace.
* Arranging to meet: Young people face a particularly high risk of having cyberstalkers try to set up meetings between them.&lt;ref name="Bocij2004"/&gt;
* The posting of defamatory or derogatory statements: Using web pages and message boards to incite some response or reaction from their victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n20iKDP88kQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=A+number+of+key+factors+have+been+identified+in+cyberstalking:&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GoKjDIVbVU&amp;sig=n0dw_3Ufyg5p1L5m-GWRQIaGvwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBWoVChMIw5DxnJH4yAIVQ91jCh2qgA8s#v=onepage&amp;q=A+number+of+key+factors+have+been+identified+in+cyberstalking:&amp;f=false|title=Bash the Stock Bashers!|first=John E.|last=Lux|date=25 July 2010|publisher=Eagle Point Publishing|access-date=1 May 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence and impact ==
According to ''Law Enforcement Technology'', cyberstalking has increased exponentially{{Failed verification|date=May 2017}} with the growth of new technology and new ways to stalk victims. "Disgruntled employees pose as their bosses to post explicit messages on social network sites; spouses use GPS to track their mates' every move. Even police and prosecutors find themselves at risk, as gang members and other organized criminals find out where they live — often to intimidate them into dropping a case."&lt;ref name="letechmagazinecyberstalking"&gt;{{cite news

In January 2009, the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] in the United States released the study "Stalking Victimization in the United States," which was sponsored by the [[Office on Violence Against Women]]. The report, based on supplemental data from the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]], showed that one in four stalking victims had been cyberstalked as well, with the perpetrators using internet-based services such as email, instant messaging, GPS, or spyware.  The final report stated that approximately 1.2 million victims had stalkers who used technology to find them.&lt;ref name="letechmagazinecyberstalking"/&gt; The [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]] (RAINN), in [[Washington D.C.]] has released statistics that there are 3.4 million stalking victims each year in the United States. Of those, one in four reported experiencing cyberstalking.&lt;ref name="timestracking"&gt;{{cite news

According to Robin M. Kowalski, a social psychologist at [[Clemson University]], cyberbullying has been shown to cause higher levels of anxiety and depression for victims than normal bullying. Kowalksi states that much of this stems from the anonymity of the perpetrators, which is a common feature of cyberstalking as well. According to a study by Kowalksi, of 3,700 bullied middle-school students, a quarter had been subjected to a form of harassment online.&lt;ref name="huffposthorro"/&gt;

== Types ==
=== Stalking by strangers ===
According to Joey Rushing, a District Attorney of [[Franklin County, Alabama]], there isn't a single definition of a cyberstalker - they can be either strangers to the victim or have a former/present relationship. "[Cyberstalkers] come in all shapes, sizes, ages and backgrounds. They patrol Web sites looking for an opportunity to take advantage of people."&lt;ref name="timestracking"/&gt;

=== Gender-based stalking ===
Harassment and stalking because of gender online is common, and can include rape threats&lt;ref&gt;K.K. Cole (2015). “It's Like She's Eager to be Verbally Abused”: Twitter, Trolls, and (En) Gendering Disciplinary Rhetoric. Feminist Media Studies, 15(2), 356-358.&lt;/ref&gt; and other threats of violence, as well as the posting of the victim's personal information.&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Mathews, S. Aghili, D. Lindskog (2013) [http://concordia.ab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Roney_Mathews.pdf A Study of Doxing, its Security Implications and Mitigation Strategies for Organizations].&lt;/ref&gt; It is blamed for limiting victims' activities online or driving them offline entirely, thereby impeding their participation in online life and undermining their autonomy, dignity, identity, and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Citron |first=Danielle Keats |title=Law's Expressive Value in Combating Cyber Gender Harassment |journal=Michigan Law Review |publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=October 2009 |volume=108 |page=373 |ssrn=1352442 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of intimate partners ===
Cyberstalking of intimate partners is the online harassment of a current or former romantic partner. It is a form of [[domestic violence]], and experts say its purpose is to control the victim in order to encourage social isolation and create dependency. Harassers may send repeated insulting or threatening e-mails to their victims, monitor or disrupt their victims' e-mail use, and use the victim's account to send e-mails to others posing as the victim or to purchase goods or services the victim does not want. They may also use the Internet to research and compile personal information about the victim, to use in order to harass him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Southworth |first1=Cynthia |last2=Finn |first2=Jerry |last3=Dawson |first3=Shawndell |last4=Fraser |first4=Cynthia |last5=Tucker |first5=Sarah |title=Intimate Partner Violence, Technology, and Stalking |publisher=Violence Against Women |year=2007 |volume=13 |series=8 |issue=8 |pages=842–856 |doi=10.1177/1077801207302045 |url=http://www.ncvc.org/src/AGP.Net/Components/DocumentViewer/Download.aspxnz?DocumentID=43672 |work=Victimsofcrime.org |accessdate=14 June 2011 |pmid=17699114 |registration=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731195144/http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/membership/member-login?aspxerrorpath=%2Four-programs%2Fstalking-resource-center%2FAGP.Net%2FComponents%2FDocumentViewer%2FDownload.aspxnz |archivedate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of celebrities and public persons ===
Profiling of stalkers shows that almost always they stalk someone they know or, via [[delusion]], think they know, as is the case with stalkers of [[celebrities]] or public persons in which the stalkers feel they know the celebrity even though the celebrity does not know them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baddteddy.com/stalkers/stalker.htm |title=How to Put Stalkers in Jail |work=Baddteddy.com |author=&lt;!-- Staff editor(s);no by-line --&gt; |accessdate=10 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719063043/http://www.baddteddy.com/stalkers/stalker.htm |archivedate=19 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the risk they take for being in the public eye, celebrities and public figures are often targets of lies or made-up stories in tabloids as well as by stalkers, some even seeming to be fans.

In one noted case in 2011, actress [[Patricia Arquette]] quit [[Facebook]] after alleged cyberstalking. In her last post, Arquette explained that her security warned her Facebook friends to never accept friend requests from people they do not actually know. Arquette stressed that just because people seemed to be fans did not mean they were safe. The media issued a statement that Arquette planned to communicate with fans exclusively through her [[Twitter]] account in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/celebrity/news/a344419/patricia-arquette-quits-facebook-after-alleged-cyberstalking.html |title=Patricia Arquette quits Facebook after alleged cyberstalking |author=Justin Harp |publisher=Digital Spy |date=7 October 2012 |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By anonymous online mobs ===
[[Web 2.0]] technologies have enabled online groups of anonymous people to self-organize to target individuals with online defamation, threats of violence and technology-based attacks. These include publishing lies and doctored photographs, threats of rape and other violence, posting sensitive personal information about victims, e-mailing damaging statements about victims to their employers, and manipulating search engines to make damaging material about the victim more prominent.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Victims frequently respond by adopting pseudonyms or going offline entirely.&lt;ref name="citron61"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Citron |first=Danielle Keats |title=Cyber Civil Rights |journal=Boston University Law Review |date=February 2009 |volume=89 |series=61 |pages=61–125 |url=http://128.197.26.3/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/volume89n1/documents/CITRON.pdf |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts attribute the destructive nature of anonymous online mobs to [[group dynamics]], saying that groups with homogeneous views tend to become more extreme. As members reinforce each others' beliefs, they fail to see themselves as individuals and lose a sense of personal responsibility for their destructive acts. In doing so they dehumanize their victims, becoming more aggressive when they believe they are supported by authority figures. Internet service providers and website owners are sometimes blamed for not speaking out against this type of harassment.&lt;ref name="citron61" /&gt;

A notable example of online mob harassment was the experience of American [[software developer]] and blogger [[Kathy Sierra]]. In 2007 a group of anonymous individuals attacked Sierra, threatening her with rape and strangulation, publishing her home address and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] number, and posting doctored photographs of her. Frightened, Sierra cancelled her speaking engagements and shut down her blog, writing "I will never feel the same. I will never be the same."&lt;ref name="citron61" /&gt;

=== Corporate cyberstalking ===
Corporate cyberstalking is when a company harasses an individual online, or an individual or group of individuals harasses an organization.&lt;ref name="Paul 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Corporate Cyberstalking |journal=First Monday |url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1002/923 |volume=7 |issue=11 |date=4 November 2002 |author=Paul Bocij |doi=10.5210/fm.v7i11.1002 |issn=1396-0466 |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motives for corporate cyberstalking are ideological, or include a desire for financial gain or revenge.&lt;ref name="Paul 2002" /&gt;

== Perpetrators ==
=== Motives and profile ===
Mental profiling of digital criminals has identified psychological and social factors that motivate stalkers as: [[envy]]; pathological obsession (professional or sexual); unemployment or failure with own job or life; intention to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior; the stalker is [[delusional]] and believes he/she "knows" the target; the stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify his/her status; belief they can get away with it(anonymity); intimidation for financial advantage or business competition; revenge over perceived or imagined rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.html |title=Cyber-Stalking: Obsessional Pursuit and the Digital Criminal |author=Wayne Petherick |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quitstalkingme.com/2011/07/28/ten-reasons-why-someone-is-stalking-you-online/ |title=Ten Reasons Why Someone is Stalking You Online |work=Quitstalkingme.com |author=Quit Stalking Me&lt;!-- that's their username, apparently --&gt; |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Four types of cyberstalkers
Preliminary work by Leroy McFarlane and Paul Bocij has identified four types of cyberstalkers: the vindictive cyberstalkers noted for the ferocity of their attacks; the composed cyberstalker whose motive is to annoy; the intimate cyberstalker who attempts to form a relationship with the victim but turns on them if rebuffed; and collective cyberstalkers, groups with a motive.&lt;ref name=Types&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leroy McFarlane, Paul Bocij |title=An exploration of predatory behaviour in cyberspace: Towards a typology of cyberstalkers |journal=First Monday |date=1 September 2003 |volume=8 |issue=9 |url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1076/996 |quote=A typology of cyberstalkers was developed. |doi=10.5210/fm.v8i9.1076 |issn=1396-0466
|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Antonio Chacón Medina, author of ''Una nueva cara de Internet, El acoso'' ("A new face of the Internet: stalking"), the general profile of the harasser is cold, with little or no respect for others. The stalker is a predator who can wait patiently until vulnerable victims appear, such as women or children, or may enjoy pursuing a particular person, whether personally familiar to them or unknown. The harasser enjoys and demonstrates their power to pursue and psychologically damage the victim.&lt;ref name="Una nueva cara de Internet, El acoso, Antonio Chacón Medina, UGR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acosomoral.org/pdf/Art_NUEVA_CARA_INTERNET_ACOSO_ETIC@NET_2003.pdf |title=Una nueva cara de Internet |format=PDF |year=2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122095139/http://www.acosomoral.org/pdf/Art_NUEVA_CARA_INTERNET_ACOSO_ETIC%40NET_2003.pdf |archivedate=November 22, 2007 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behaviors ===
Cyberstalkers find their victims by using [[search engine]]s, online forums, bulletin and discussion boards, [[chat room]]s, and more recently, through [[social networking]] sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pikul |first=Corrie |url=http://www.elle.com/Life-Love/Sex-Relationships/Confessions-of-a-Facebook-Stalker |title=Confessions of a Facebook Stalker |publisher=Elle.com |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623065605/http://www.elle.com/Life-Love/Sex-Relationships/Confessions-of-a-Facebook-Stalker |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], [[Bebo]], [[Friendster]], [[Twitter]], and [[Indymedia]], a media outlet known for self-publishing. They may engage in live chat harassment or [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]] or they may send electronic viruses and unsolicited e-mails.&lt;ref name="cyber_1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32458 |title=Cyberstalking |publisher=The National Center For Victims of Crime |year=2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040617175754/http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/main.aspx?dbName=DocumentViewer&amp;DocumentID=32458 |archivedate=17 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberstalkers may research individuals to feed their obsessions and curiosity. Conversely, the acts of cyberstalkers may become more intense, such as repeatedly instant messaging their targets.&lt;ref name="Stalking by IM" &gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=97035 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113034833/http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=97035 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-13 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |title=Compulsions in Depression: Stalking by Text Message |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.9.1642 |volume=163 |issue=9 |page=1642 |last=Howes |first=Oliver D. |date=September 2006 |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More commonly they will post defamatory or derogatory statements about their stalking target on web pages, message boards, and in guest books designed to get a reaction or response from their victim, thereby initiating contact.&lt;ref name="cyber_1" /&gt; In some cases, they have been known to create [[fake blog]]s in the name of the victim containing defamatory or pornographic content.

When prosecuted, many stalkers have unsuccessfully attempted to justify their behavior based on their use of public forums, as opposed to direct contact. Once they get a reaction from the victim, they will typically attempt to track or follow the victim's internet activity. Classic cyberstalking behavior includes the tracing of the victim's [[IP address]] in an attempt to verify their home or place of employment.&lt;ref name="cyber_1" /&gt;

Some cyberstalking situations do evolve into physical stalking, and a victim may experience abusive and excessive phone calls, vandalism, threatening or obscene mail, trespassing, and physical assault.&lt;ref name="cyber_1" /&gt; Moreover, many physical stalkers will use cyberstalking as another method of harassing their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexualharassmentsupport.org/TypesofStalkers.html |title=Types of Stalkers and Stalking Patterns |work=Sexualharrassmentsupport.com |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/2.html |title=Cyber-Stalking: Obsessional Pursuit and the Digital Criminal |work=CrimeLibrary.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831232627/http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/2.html |archivedate=2006-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyberstalking legislation ==
{{Main|Cyberstalking legislation}}
Legislation on cyberstalking varies from country to country. Cyberstalking and cyberbullying are relatively new phenomena, but that does not mean that crimes committed through the network are not punishable under legislation drafted for that purpose. Although there are often existing laws that prohibit stalking or harassment in a general sense, legislators sometimes believe that such laws are inadequate or do not go far enough, and thus bring forward new legislation to address this perceived shortcoming. In the [[United States]], for example, nearly every state has laws that address cyberstalking, cyberbullying, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=13495|title=Legislative News, Studies and Analysis - National Conference of State Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|last=Legislatures|date=|website=www.ncsl.org|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries such as the US, in practice, there is little legislative difference between the concepts of "cyberbullying" and "cyberstalking." The primary distinction is one of age; if adults are involved, the act is usually termed ''[[wikt:cyberstalking|cyberstalking]],'' while among children it is usually referred to as ''[[wiktionary:cyberbullying|cyberbullying]].'' However, this distinction is one of semantics, and many laws treat ''bullying'' and ''stalking'' as much the same issue.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], the Stalking Amendment Act (1999) includes the use of any form of technology to harass a target as forms of "criminal stalking."

=== Canada ===
In 2012, there was a high-profile investigation into the death of [[Amanda Todd]], a young Canadian student who'd been blackmailed and stalked online before committing suicide. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] were criticized in the media for not naming one of her alleged stalkers as a person of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoffberger |first=Chase |url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/daily-capper-amanda-todd-kody-viper/ |title="The Daily Capper" exposes alleged culprit in Amanda Todd suicide |publisher=The Daily Dot |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippines ===
In the Fifteenth Congress of the [[Republic of the Philippines]], a cyberstalking bill was introduced by Senator [[Manny Villar]]. The result was to "urge the Senate Committees on Science and Technology, and Public Information and Mass Media to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, on the increasing occurrence of cyber stalking cases and the modus operandi adopted in the internet to perpetuate crimes with the end in view of formulating legislation and policy measures geared towards curbing cyber stalking and other cyber crimes and protect online users in the country.

=== United States ===
==== History, current legislation ====
Cyberstalking is a [[criminal offense]] under American anti-stalking, [[slander]], and [[harassment]] laws.

A conviction can result in a [[restraining order]], [[probation]], or criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Cyberstalking specifically has been addressed in recent U.S. federal law. For example, the [[Violence Against Women Act]], passed in 2000, made cyberstalking a part of the federal interstate stalking statute.&lt;ref name="cyber_1" /&gt; The current US Federal Anti-Cyber-Stalking law is found at {{UnitedStatesCode|47|223}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/cda/47usc223.htm |title=Cybertelecom :: 47 USC 233 |publisher=Cybertelecom |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, there remains a lack of federal legislation to specifically address cyberstalking, leaving the majority of legislative at the state level.&lt;ref name="cyber_1" /&gt; A few states have both stalking and harassment statutes that criminalize threatening and unwanted electronic communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working to Halt Online Abuse|url=http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws|website=Working to Halt Online Abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first anti-stalking law was enacted in California in 1990, and while all fifty states soon passed anti-stalking laws, by 2009 only 14 of them had laws specifically addressing "high-tech stalking."&lt;ref name="letechmagazinecyberstalking"/&gt; The first U.S. cyberstalking law went into effect in 1999 in [[California]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Other states have laws other than harassment or anti-stalking statutes that prohibit misuse of computer communications and e-mail, while others have passed laws containing broad language that can be interpreted to include cyberstalking behaviors, such as in their harassment or stalking legislation.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Sentences can range from 18 months in prison and a $10,000 fine for a fourth-degree charge to ten years in prison and a $150,000 fine for a second-degree charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doxing What to look for.

; States with cyberstalking legislation
* [[Alabama]], [[Arizona]], [[Connecticut]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] have included prohibitions against harassing electronic, computer or e-mail communications in their harassment legislation.
* [[Alaska]], [[Florida]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Wyoming]], and [[California]], have incorporated electronically communicated statements as conduct constituting stalking in their anti-stalking laws.
* [[Texas]] enacted the ''Stalking by Electronic Communications Act'', 2001.
* [[Missouri]] revised its state harassment statutes to include stalking and harassment by telephone and electronic communications (as well as [[cyber-bullying]]) after the [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier suicide case of 2006]]. In one of the few cases where a cyberstalking conviction was obtained the cyberstalker was a woman, which is also much rarer that male cyberstalkers.&lt;ref name="stltoday-cyber-bullying"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stltoday.com/suburban-journals/article_5bdf7463-45d7-500c-9e00-5420bcde5418.html |title=Blunt signs cyberbullying bill |last=Perry |first=Elizabeth |date=2 July 2008 |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |publisher=Stltoday.com |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conviction was overturned in on appeal in 2009 however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/11/lori-drew-appeal/|title=Prosecutors Drop Plans to Appeal Lori Drew Case|last=Zetter|first=Kim|date=November 20, 2009|work=[[Wired News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Florida]], HB 479 was introduced in 2003 to ban cyberstalking. This was signed into law on October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Fc3/cyberstalking.html |title=Florida Statute 784.048 |publisher=Florida Computer Crime Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205233057/http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/Fc3/cyberstalking.html |archivedate=2007-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age, legal limitations ====
While some laws only address online harassment of children, there are laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws offer help to victims of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/index.shtml |title=Current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws |work=Working to Halt Online Abuse |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stalking laws require that the perpetrator make a credible threat of violence against the victim; others include threats against the victim's immediate family; and still others require the alleged stalker's course of conduct constitute an implied threat. While some conduct involving annoying or menacing behavior might fall short of illegal stalking, such behavior may be a prelude to stalking and violence and should be treated seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/cyberstalking.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225045406/http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/cyberstalking.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2010 |title=Cyberstalking: A New Challenge for Law Enforcement and Industry |work=Justice.gov |publisher=The United States Department of Justice |date=August 1999 |accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online identity stealth blurs the line on infringement of the rights of would-be victims to identify their perpetrators. There is a debate on how internet use can be traced without infringing on protected civil liberties.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==== Specific cases ====
There have been a number of high-profile legal cases in the United States related to cyberstalking, many of which have involved the suicides of young students.&lt;ref name="huffposthorro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/alexis-pilkington-faceboo_n_512482.html |title=Alexis Pilkington Facebook Horror: Cyber Bullies Harass Teen Even After Suicide |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=25 May 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20022556-504083.html |title=Samantha Kelly Bullied to Death: Mich. 14-Year-Old's Suicide Followed Harassment After Rape Claim - Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |date=11 November 2010 |author=Carlin Miller |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725193942/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20022556-504083.html |archivedate=July 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In thousands of other cases, charges either weren't brought for the cyber harassment or were unsuccessful in obtaining convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57579366-504083/audrie-pott-rehtaeh-parsons-suicides-show-sexual-cyber-bulling-is-pervasive-and-getting-worse-expert-says/ |title=Audrie Pott, Rehtaeh Parsons suicides show sexual cyber-bulling is "pervasive" and "getting worse," expert says - Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |author=Julia Dahl |date=12 April 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in all legal instances, much depends on public sympathy towards the victim, the quality of legal representation and other factors that can greatly influence the outcome of the crime – even if it will be considered a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neil Katz |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20022676-10391704.html |title=Samantha Kelly, 14, Cyberbullied Even After Suicide - HealthPop |publisher=CBS News |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of a fourteen-year-old student in Michigan, for instance, she pressed charges against her alleged rapist, which resulted in her being cyberstalked and cyberbullied by fellow students. After her suicide in 2010 all charges were dropped against the man who allegedly raped her, on the basis that the only witness was dead. This is the despite the fact that statutory rape charges could have been pressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mary M.

[[File:East_Bengal_Map.png|thumb|200px|right|Map of [[East Pakistan]], which later became [[Bangladesh]].]]
The '''East Pakistan Renaissance Society''' was a political organisation formed to articulate and promote culturally and intellectually the idea for a [[Two-Nation Theory|separate Muslim state]] for [[Indian Muslims]] and specifically for the Muslims of [[Bengal]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pakistan: A Modern History|author=Ian Talbott|pages=88–92|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=978-0-312-21606-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation's founders and leaders included [[Abul Kalam Shamsuddin]], the society president, [[Habibullah Bahar Chowdhury]] and [[Mujibur Rahman Khan]].&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Bangladesh|author=Nagendra Kr. Singh|pages=180–82|publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt.

==History==
The "[[Two-Nation Theory]]", which argued that the [[Hindus]] and [[Muslims]] of India were not a common nation and could not live together as a nation, had been propagated by Muslim politicians and intellectuals such as [[Sir Muhammad Iqbal]], [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]] and [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the president of the [[All India Muslim League]].&lt;ref name="winks2001"&gt;{{cite book | author=Robin W. Winks, Alaine M. Low | date=2001 | title=The Oxford history of the British Empire: Historiography | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IRB52ijcgMMC |publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-924680-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="khan1940"&gt;{{cite book | author=Liaquat Ali Khan | date=1940 | title=Pakistan: The Heart of Asia | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swIYjzJOx5wC | publisher=Thacker &amp; Co. Ltd. | isbn= 978-1-4437-2667-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for a separate state for Indian Muslims took definite shape when the All India Muslim League adopted the [[Lahore Resolution]] (also known as the Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March 1940. The resolution called for the Muslim-majority provinces of [[British India]] to be constituted as separate, independent states – it did not specify a single state.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;
===Foundation===
At a meeting held on 30 August 1942, at the offices of [[the Azad]] newspaper in [[Kolkata]], Bengali Muslim activists decided to form the East Pakistan Renaissance Society as a platform to advocate the idea of a Muslim state on a cultural and intellectual basis. The society held regular weekly meetings where articles would be presented and different issues discussed. Despite the focus on [[Islam]], the meetings were not restricted to Muslims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Manabendranath Roy]] delivered a speech on ''Pakistan and Democracy'', which highlighted the inevitability of self-rule for [[Indian Muslims]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In September 1944, Mujibur Rahman Khan along with economist M Sadeq, published a booklet, ''Eastern Pakistan: Its Population, Delimitation and Economics'' which This contained a description of the government, economy, population, geographic boundary and security of a future state of [[East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The society held its first council at the [[Maulana Azad College|Islamia College]] in Kolkata in July 1944. Among those present at the inaugural occasion were [[Khwaja Nazimuddin]], [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], Hasan Suhrawardy, [[Nurul Amin]], [[Mohammad Akram Khan]], [[A K Fazlul Huq]], Abul Quasem, [[Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan]], [[Shahadat Hossain]], [[Golam Mostofa (poet)|Golam Mostofa]], [[S. Wajid Ali|S Wajid Ali]], [[Abujafar Shamsuddin|Abu Jafar Shamsuddin]], Abul Hussain, Golam Kuddus, [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (poet)|Subhas Mukhopadhyay]], Gopal Halder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Philosophical differences==
The Muslim League and most other advocates of Pakistan had demanded a single state of Pakistan consisting of the British Indian provinces of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (then Northwest Frontier Province), [[Sindh]], [[Balochistan]] and [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], and sought the [[Urdu language]] to be the only official language and ''lingua franca'' of Muslims.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; However, the East Pakistan Renaissance Society not only argued that Muslims were a separate nation from Hindus, it also advocated that the [[Bengali Muslims]] were distinct from the Muslims of other parts of India, on an ethnic, cultural and geographical basis.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Unlike religion, the society argued that ethnicity and cultural differences cannot cross geographic boundaries.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; The society and its supporters in the Bengal Muslim League asserted that Bengali Muslims should constitute an independent state, as an "Eastern Pakistan" rather than part of a single state of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harun-or-Rashid |year=2003 |title=The foreshadowing of Bangladesh: Bengal Muslim League &amp; Muslim politics, 1906–47 |publisher=University Press |isbn=978-984-05-1688-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society asserted the importance of the Bengali culture and language, which many advocates of Pakistan criticised as being "Hinduised" and "Sanskritised."&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{cite journal

==Aftermath==
The society dissolved after the [[partition of India]] in 1947, which also partitioned Bengal to create the Muslim-majority [[East Bengal]] (also known as East Pakistan), which became part of Pakistan; Hindu-majority [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]] became part of India. Several of the society's leaders were leading activists in the [[Bengali language movement]] (1953–1956), which was a mass struggle in East Pakistan for the recognition of the Bengali language as the second official language of Pakistan, along with Urdu.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

Vincent }}&lt;/ref&gt; and behavioral change through education. 

Usually, the goal of demand-side management is to encourage the consumer to use less energy during [[peak demand|peak]] hours, or to move the time of energy use to off-peak times such as nighttime and weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.wa.gov.au/2/3203/64/demand_management.pm|title=Demand Management|website= Office of Energy|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peak demand management does not necessarily decrease total [[Domestic energy consumption|energy consumption]], but could be expected to reduce the need for investments in networks and/or [[electricity generation|power]] plants for meeting peak demands. An example is the use of energy storage units to store energy during off-peak hours and discharge them during peak hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wei-Yu Chiu|author2=Hongjian Sun|author3=H.V.

The American electric power industry originally relied heavily on foreign energy imports, whether in the form of consumable electricity or fossil fuels that were then used to produce electricity. During the time of the energy crises in the 1970s, the federal government passed the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act|Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA)]], hoping to reduce dependence on foreign oil and to promote [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and alternative energy sources. This act forced utilities to obtain the cheapest possible power from independent power producers, which in turn promoted renewables and encouraged the utility to reduce the amount of power they need, hence pushing forward agendas for energy efficiency and demand management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/strengthen-policy/public-utility-regulatory.html|website= UCSUSA|publisher=UCSUSA|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term DSM was coined following the time of the [[1973 energy crisis]] and [[1979 energy crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Torriti, Jacopo |year=2016|title=Peak energy demand and Demand Side Response|publisher=Routledge|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/9781138016255|isbn=9781138016255}}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments of many countries mandated performance of various programs for demand management. An early example is the [[National Energy Conservation Policy Act]] of 1978 in the [[United States|U.S.]], preceded by similar actions in [[California]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Demand-side management was introduced publicly by [[Electric Power Research Institute]] (EPRI) in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ISET-India.2011.6145388 |chapter=Review of demand response under smart grid paradigm |title=ISGT2011-India |pages=236–43 |year=2011 |last1=Murthy Balijepalli |first1=V.

M |isbn=978-1-4673-0315-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, DSM technologies become increasingly feasible due to the integration of [[information and communications technology]] and the power system, new terms such as integrated demand-side management (IDSM), or  [[smart grid]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Operation==
Electricity use can vary dramatically on short and medium time frames, depending on current weather patterns. Generally the wholesale electricity system adjusts to changing demand by dispatching additional or less generation. However, during peak periods, the additional generation is usually supplied by less efficient ("peaking") sources. Unfortunately, the instantaneous financial and environmental cost of using these "peaking" sources is not necessarily reflected in the retail pricing system. In addition, the ability or willingness of electricity consumers to adjust to price signals by altering demand ([[elasticity of demand]]) may be low, particularly over short time frames. In many markets, consumers (particularly retail customers) do not face real-time pricing at all, but pay rates based on average annual costs or other constructed prices.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Energy demand management activities attempt to bring the electricity demand and supply closer to a perceived optimum, and help give electricity end users benefits for reducing their demand. In the modern system, the integrated approach to demand-side management is becoming increasingly common. IDSM automatically sends signals to end-use systems to shed load depending on system conditions. This allows for very precise tuning of demand to ensure that it matches supply at all times, reduces capital expenditures for the utility. Critical system conditions could be peak times, or in areas with levels of [[variable renewable energy]], during times when demand must be adjusted upward to avoid over-generation or downward to help with ramping needs.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

In general, adjustments to demand can occur in various ways: through responses to price signals, such as permanent differential rates for evening and day times or occasional highly priced usage days, behavioral changes achieved through [[Home network|home area networks]], automated controls such as with remotely controlled air-conditioners, or with permanent load adjustments with energy efficient appliances.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Logical foundations==
Demand for any commodity can be modified by actions of market players and government ([[regulation]] and taxation). Energy demand management implies actions that influence demand for energy. DSM was originally adopted in electricity, but today it is applied widely to utilities including water and gas as well.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Reducing energy demand is contrary to what both energy suppliers and governments have been doing during most of the modern industrial history. Whereas real prices of various energy forms have been decreasing during most of the industrial era, due to [[economies of scale]] and technology, the expectation for the future is the opposite. Previously, it was not unreasonable to promote energy use as more copious and cheaper energy sources could be anticipated in the future or the supplier had installed excess capacity that would be made more profitable by increased consumption.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

In [[Planned economy|centrally planned economies]] subsidizing energy was one of the main economic development tools. Subsidies to the energy supply industry are still common in some countries.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Contrary to the historical situation, energy prices and availability are expected to deteriorate. Governments and other public actors, if not the energy suppliers themselves, are tending to employ energy demand measures that will increase the efficiency of energy consumption.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Types==

*[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]]: Using less power to perform the same tasks. This involves a permanent reduction of demand by using more efficient load-intensive appliances such as water heaters, refrigerators, or washing machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/strengthen-policy/public-utility-regulatory.html|website=ACEEE|publisher=ACEEE|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Demand response]]: Any reactive or preventative method to reduce, flatten or shift demand. Historically, demand response programs have focused on peak reduction to defer the high cost of constructing generation capacity. However, demand response programs are now being looked to assist with changing the net load shape as well, load minus solar and wind generation, to help with integration of [[variable renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sila Kiliccote; Pamela Sporborg; Imran Sheikh; Erich Huffaker; and Mary Ann Piette; "Integrating Renewable Resources in California and the Role of Automated Demand Response," Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Environmental Energy Technologies Division), Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Demand response includes all intentional modifications to consumption patterns of electricity of end user customers that are intended to alter the timing, level of instantaneous demand, or the total electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/PES.2007.385728 |chapter=Demand Response in Electricity Markets: An Overview |title=2007 IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting |pages=1–5 |year=2007 |last1=Albadi |first1=M. H |last2=El-Saadany |first2=E. F |isbn=1-4244-1296-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demand response refers to a wide range of actions which can be taken at the customer side of the electricity meter in response to particular conditions within the electricity system (such as peak period network congestion or high prices), including the aforementioned IDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2009.05.021 |title=Demand response experience in Europe: Policies, programmes and implementation |journal=Energy |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=1575–83 |year=2010 |last1=Torriti |first1=Jacopo |last2=Hassan |first2=Mohamed G |last3=Leach |first3=Matthew }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dynamic demand (electric power)|Dynamic demand]]: Advance or delay appliance operating cycles by a few seconds to increase the [[diversity factor]] of the set of loads. The concept is that by monitoring the [[power factor]] of the power grid, as well as their own control parameters, individual, intermittent loads would switch on or off at optimal moments to balance the overall system load with generation, reducing critical power mismatches. As this switching would only advance or delay the appliance operating cycle by a few seconds, it would be unnoticeable to the end user. In the United States, in 1982, a (now-lapsed) patent for this idea was issued to power systems engineer Fred Schweppe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4317049.html US-Patent No. 4,317,049: Frequency adaptive, power-energy re-scheduler]&lt;/ref&gt; This type of dynamic demand control is frequently used for air-conditioners. One example of this is through the SmartAC program in California.
*[[Distributed Energy Resources]]: Distributed generation, also distributed energy, on-site generation (OSG) or district/decentralized energy is electrical generation and storage performed by a variety of small, grid-connected devices referred to as distributed energy resources (DER). Conventional power stations, such as coal-fired, gas and nuclear powered plants, as well as hydroelectric dams and large-scale solar power stations, are centralized and often require electric energy to be transmitted over long distances. By contrast, DER systems are decentralized, modular and more flexible technologies, that are located close to the load they serve, albeit having capacities of only 10 megawatts (MW) or less. These systems can comprise multiple generation and storage components; in this instance they are referred to as hybrid power systems. DER systems typically use renewable energy sources, including small hydro, biomass, biogas, solar power, wind power, and geothermal power, and increasingly play an important role for the electric power distribution system. A grid-connected device for electricity storage can also be classified as a DER system, and is often called a distributed energy storage system (DESS). By means of an interface, DER systems can be managed and coordinated within a smart grid. Distributed generation and storage enables collection of energy from many sources and may lower environmental impacts and improve security of supply.

==Scale==
Broadly, demand side management can be classified into four categories: national scale, utility scale, community scale, and individual household scale.

===National scale===
Energy efficiency improvement is one of the most important demand side management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TII.2011.2158841 |title=Demand Side Management: Demand Response, Intelligent Energy Systems, and Smart Loads |journal=IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=381–8 |year=2011 |last1=Palensky |first1=Peter |last2=Dietrich |first2=Dietmar }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency improvements can be implemented nationally through legislation and standards in housing, building, appliances, transport, machinaries etc.

===Utility scale===
During peak demand time, utilities are able to control storage water heaters, pool pumps and air conditioners in large areas to reduce peak demand, e.g. Australia and Switzerland. One of the common technologies is ripple control: high frequency signal (e.g. 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz) is superimposed to normal electricity (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) to switch on or off devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1049/piee.1975.0260 |title=Development, design and use of ripple control |journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers |volume=122 |issue=10R |pages=993 |year=1975 |last1=Kidd |first1=W.L }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In more service based economy, such as Australia, electricity network peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon to early evening (4pm to 8pm). Residential and commercial demand are the most significant part in these types of peak demand &lt;ref&gt;L. Liu, M. Shafiei, G. Ledwich, W. Miller, and G. Nourbakhsh, "Correlation Study of Residential Community Demand with High PV Penetration," 2017 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC) &lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, it makes great sense for utilities (electricity network distributors) to manage residential storage water heaters, pool pumps and air conditioners.

===Community scale===
Other names can be neighborhood, precinct, or district. Community central heating systems have been existing for many decades in regions of cold winters. Similarly, peak demand in summer peak regions need to be managed, e.g. Texas &amp; Florida in the U.S., Queensland and New South Wales in Australia. Demand side management can be implemented in community scale to reduce peak demand for heating or cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/AUPEC.2016.7749301 |chapter=Demand side management with stepped model predictive control |title=2016 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC) |pages=1–6 |year=2016 |last1=Liu |first1=Aaron Lei |last2=Ledwich |first2=Gerard |last3=Miller |first3=Wendy |isbn=978-1-5090-1405-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Liu, L., Miller, W., &amp; Ledwich, G. (2016). Community centre improvement to reduce air conditioning peak demand. Paper presented at the Healthy Housing 2016: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Energy and Environment of Residential Buildings, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Qld. http://eprints.qut.edu.au/101161/ &lt;/ref&gt;Another aspect is to achieve Net Zero Energy Building or community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2017.10.008 |title=Involving occupants in net-zero-energy solar housing retrofits: An Australian sub-tropical case study |journal=Solar Energy |volume=159 |pages=390–404 |year=2018 |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Lei Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Gray |first4=Matthew |bibcode=2018SoEn..159..390M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing energy, peak demand and bills in community level may be more feasible and viable, because of the collective purchasing power, the bargaining power, more options in energy efficiency or storage &lt;ref&gt;L. Liu, W. Miller, and G. Ledwich. (2017) Solutions for reducing electricity costs for communal facilities. Australian Ageing Agenda. 39-40. Available: https://eprints.qut.edu.au/112305/ 
https://www.australianageingagenda.com.au/2017/10/27/solutions-reducing-facility-electricity-costs/&lt;/ref&gt;, more flexibility and diversity in generating and consuming energy at different times, e.g. using PV to compensate day time consumption or for energy storage.

===Household scale===
In areas of Australia, more than 30% (2016) of households have rooftop photo-voltaic systems. It is useful for them to use free energy from the sun to reduce energy import from the grid. Further, demand side management can be helpful when a systematic approach is considered: the operation of photovoltaic, air conditioner, battery energy storage systems, storage water heaters, building performance and energy efficiency measures.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Examples==

===Queensland, Australia===
The utility companies in the state of Queensland, Australia have devices fitted onto certain household appliances such as air conditioners or into household meters to control water heater, pool pumps etc. These devices would allow energy companies to remotely cycle the use of these items during peak hours. Their plan also includes improving the efficiency of energy-using items, encouraging the use of oil instead of electricity, and giving financial incentives to consumers who use electricity during off-peak hours, when it is less expensive for energy companies to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.qld.gov.au/pdf/factsheets/1energy-b1.pdf|title=Energy Conservation and Demand Management Program|work=Queensland Government|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=2 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219030422/http://www.climatechange.qld.gov.au/pdf/factsheets/1energy-b1.pdf|archivedate=19 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is that with demand side management, Southeast Queensland households can use electricity from rooftop photo-voltaic system to heat up water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/APPEEC.2015.7381047 |chapter=Single household domestic water heater design and control utilising PV energy: The untapped energy storage solution |title=2015 IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC) |pages=1–5 |year=2015 |last1=Liu |first1=Aaron Lei |last2=Ledwich |first2=Gerard |last3=Miller |first3=Wendy |isbn=978-1-4673-8132-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto, Canada===
In 2008, Toronto Hydro, the monopoly energy distributor of Ontario, had over 40,000 people signed up to have remote devices attached to air conditioners which energy companies use to offset spikes in demand. Spokeswoman Tanya Bruckmueller says that this program can reduce demand by 40 megawatts during emergency situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bradbury, Danny|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/analysis/1804282/volatile-energy-prices-demand-form-management|title=Volatile energy prices demand new form of management|work=businessGreen|publisher=Association of Online Publishers|date=5 November 2007|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California, US===
California has several demand side management programs, including automated and critical peak pricing demand response programs for commercial and industrial customers as well as residential consumers, energy efficiency rebates, non-event based time-of-use pricing, special electric vehicle charging rates, and distributed storage. Some of these programs are slated to be added into the wholesale electricity market to be bid as "supply side" resources that can be dispatched by the system operator. Demand side management in the state will be increasingly important as the level of renewable generation approaches 33% by 2020, and is expected to be increased beyond that level in the long-term.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

=== Indiana, US ===
The Aloca's Warrick Operation is participating in MISO as a qualified demand response resource, which means it is providing demand response in terms of energy, spinning reserve, and regulation service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://eaei.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/Providing_Reliability_Services_through_Demand_Response__A_Preliminary_Evaluation_of_the_Demand_Response_Capabilities_of_Alcoa_Inc..pdf|title =Providing Reliability Services through Demand Response: A Preliminary Evaluation of the Demand Response Capabilities of Alcoa Inc.|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20161229195628/https://eaei.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/Providing_Reliability_Services_through_Demand_Response__A_Preliminary_Evaluation_of_the_Demand_Response_Capabilities_of_Alcoa_Inc..pdf|archivedate =2016-12-29|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ISGT.2015.7131854 |chapter=Bidding strategy in energy and spinning reserve markets for aluminum smelters' demand response |title=2015 IEEE Power &amp; Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT) |pages=1–5 |year=2015 |last1=Zhang |first1=Xiao |last2=Hug |first2=Gabriela |isbn=978-1-4799-1785-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Demand-side management can apply to electricity system based on thermal power plants or to systems where [[renewable energy]], as [[hydroelectricity]], is predominant but with a complementary [[thermoelectric|thermal generation]], for instance, in [[Brazil]].

In Brazil’s case, despite the generation of [[Renewable energy in Brazil#Hydroelectric power|hydroelectric power]] corresponds to more than 80% of the total, to achieve a practical balance in the generation system, the energy generated by hydroelectric plants supplies the consumption below the [[peak demand]]. Peak generation is supplied by the use of fossil-fuel power plants. In 2008, Brazilian consumers paid more than U$1 billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=CCEE|year=2008|title=Relatório de Informações ao Público|journal=Análise Anual|url=http://www.ccee.org.br/StaticFile/Arquivo/biblioteca_virtual/Relatorios_Publico/Anual/relatorio_anual_2008.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214162214/http://www.ccee.org.br/StaticFile/Arquivo/biblioteca_virtual/Relatorios_Publico/Anual/relatorio_anual_2008.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for complementary thermoelectric generation not previously programmed.

In Brazil, the consumer pays for all the investment to provide energy, even if a plant sits idle. For most fossil-fuel thermal plants, the consumers pay for the "fuels" and others operation costs only when these plants generate energy. The energy, per unit generated, is more expensive from thermal plants than from hydroelectric. Only a few of the Brazilian's thermoelectric plants use [[natural gas]], so they [[pollution|pollute]] significantly more. The power generated to meet the peak demand has higher costs—both investment and operating costs—and the pollution has a significant environmental cost and potentially, financial and social liability for its use. Thus, the expansion and the operation of the current system is not as efficient as it could be using demand side management. The consequence of this inefficiency is an increase in energy tariffs ... passed on to the consumers.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Moreover, because [[electric energy]] is generated and consumed almost instantaneously, all the facilities, as transmission lines and distribution nets, are built for peak consumption. During the non-peak periods their full capacity is not utilized.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The reduction of peak consumption can benefit the efficiency of the electric systems, like the Brazilian system, in some senses: as deferring new investments in distribution and transmission networks, and reducing the necessity of complementary thermal power operation during peak periods, which can diminish both the payment for investment in new power plants to supply only during the peak period and the environmental impact associated with [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emission]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Issues==
Some people argue that demand-side management has been ineffective because it has often resulted in higher utility costs for consumers and less profit for utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0165-0572(92)90025-C |title=Demand-side management |journal=Resources and Energy |volume=14 |pages=187–203 |year=1992 |last1=Katz |first1=Myron B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main goals of demand side management is to be able to charge the consumer based on the true price of the utilities at that time. If consumers could be charged less for using electricity during off-peak hours, and more during peak hours, then [[supply and demand]] would theoretically encourage the consumer to use less electricity during peak hours, thus achieving the main goal of demand side management.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

Another problem of DSM is privacy, as consumers have to provide some information about their usage of electricity to their electricity company. This is less of a problem now as people are used to suppliers noting purchasing patterns through mechanisms such as "loyalty cards".{{fact|date=December 2017}}

The '''European Drivers' Championship''' was an annual competition in [[auto racing]] that existed prior to the establishment of the [[Formula One]] world championship in 1950. It was established in [[1931 Grand Prix season|1931]] and ran until the end of [[1939 Grand Prix season|1939]] with a hiatus from 1933–34, and awarded points to drivers based on the results of selected [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] races, the so-called ''Grandes Épreuves'' (this term had been used for the most prestigious races since the 1920s; in 1931 and 1935, some significant Grands Prix which did not count towards the European Championship were still called Grandes Épreuves). The championship was discontinued because of the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, and no champion was officially declared for the last season.

The championship was run by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (AIACR), the forerunner to the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] who are today's world governing body of motorsport.

==History==
[[Image:LangH-MB-W125-1977.jpg|thumb|215px|[[Hermann Lang]] demonstrating a [[Mercedes-Benz W125]] at the [[Nürburgring]] in 1977. Lang drove a W125 to victory on its [[1937 Grand Prix season|1937]] début.]]
The 1931 and 1932 seasons were run to existing [[Formula Libre]] regulations, with a minimum car weight of 900&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="gpwinners"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gpw5.htm | author = Etzrodt, Hans | title=GRAND PRIX WINNERS 1895-1949 | publisher= The Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing | accessdate=2007-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar consisted of the [[Italian Grand Prix]], the [[French Grand Prix]] and the [[Belgian Grand Prix]].

In 1934, the AIACR introduced a maximum weight limit of 750&amp;nbsp;kg for Grand Prix cars.&lt;ref name="cf1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rendall |first=Ivan |title=The Chequered Flag : 100 years of motor racing |year=1995 |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |isbn=0-297-83550-5|page=136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1933, new chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]] had announced that he would provide 450,000&amp;nbsp;[[German reichsmark|reichsmarks]] to German companies to build Grand Prix cars. Eventually, the money was split between bidders, [[Mercedes-Benz]] and the newly formed [[Auto Union]].&lt;ref name="cf1" /&gt; Auto Union took over the P-Wagen concept of [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and put the engine behind the driver. Both German manufacturers proved dominant in nearly all races they entered.&lt;ref name="cf1" /&gt; These cars proved to be the bases for the two companies entries in the first year of the European Championship. Other entries came from manufacturers including [[Alfa Romeo]], whose team were being run by [[Scuderia Ferrari]], [[Maserati]], and [[Bugatti]].

The 750&amp;nbsp;kg formula lasted until the end of 1937. By then, the German cars had over 600&amp;nbsp;hp, more than twice the rule makers had expected to be possible with that weight limit. For 1938, a new formula was introduced, limiting also engine sizes. Cars with a supercharger were permitted to have an engine size between 666&amp;nbsp;cc and 3000&amp;nbsp;cc, whereas [[Naturally-aspirated engine|normally aspirated]] cars were allowed between 1000&amp;nbsp;cc and 4500&amp;nbsp;cc.&lt;ref name="goldenage"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/gp381.htm | title=1938, Part 1 : Introduction | publisher= The Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing | accessdate=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cars had to weigh between 400&amp;nbsp;kg and 850&amp;nbsp;kg; the exact minimum weight specified in the regulations was dependent on a car's engine capacity and followed a linear scale.&lt;ref name="goldenage" /&gt;

[[Image:LangH-MB-W154-1986-08-16.jpg|thumb|215px|[[Hermann Lang]], despite finishing second on points in [[1939 Grand Prix season|1939]] in the [[Mercedes-Benz W154]] (shown here in 1986), was declared champion by the [[Nazism|Nazis]].]]
At the AIACR's end of season meeting towards the end of 1938, it was expressed that some were not content using the then current points system. Belgium's representative, Mr. Langlois, was asked to come up with an alternative system for 1939.&lt;ref name="8w"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://8w.forix.com/ec1939.html | title=The 1939 European Championship | publisher= 8W | accessdate=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Langlois took several months to propose a new system and there is no evidence to suggest that the previous scoring system was rescinded.&lt;ref name="8w" /&gt;

In 1939, [[World War II|war]] broke out and the AIACR could not meet to publish an official set of championship results.&lt;ref name="goldenage2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kolumbus.fi/leif.snellman/cha9.htm | title=1939 Championship Table | publisher= The Golden Era of Grand Prix Racing | accessdate=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann Lang]] was declared European champion by [[Korpsführer]] [[Adolf Hühnlein]] of the [[National Socialist Motor Corps|NSKK]], who was also president of Germany's highest racing organisation, [[Deutscher Motor Sport Bund|Oberste Nationale Sportbehörde für die Deutsche Kraftfahrt]]. Hühnlein's declaration was published as a statement in the [[Völkischer Beobachter]], the official [[Nazi Party]] newsletter.&lt;ref name="8w" /&gt; Hühnlein suggested that Lang had finished the season on 23 points,&lt;ref name="8w" /&gt; but this conflicts with the official scoring system, under which [[Hermann Paul Müller]] would have been the champion.

==Summary of results==

===Scoring system===
Unlike the modern Formula One points system, the championship awarded fewer points for higher finishes; the champion would be the driver who ended the season on the lowest points score. The championship awarded one, two and three points to first, second and third places respectively. Other competitors were awarded points based on the percentage of the race distance they completed, as follows.
{|class="wikitable" style="font-size:95%"

Not entering, or failing to start the race, earned the driver eight points. Drivers only scored points with the car they entered the race with. In 1931, co-drivers were eligible to score championship points, but only from the car they were assigned to at the start, and provided that they had completed a stint in the car during the race. From 1932 onwards, if a driver handed his car over to another driver mid-race, only the original driver would score points from the car's final position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9285">'''Fakelore''' or '''pseudo-folklore''' is inauthentic, manufactured [[folklore]] presented as if it were genuinely [[traditional]]. The term can refer to new stories or songs made up, or to folklore that is reworked and modified for modern tastes.  The element of misrepresentation is central; artists who draw on traditional stories in their work are not producing fakelore unless they claim that their creations are real folklore.&lt;ref name="Dorson-1977-4"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dorson | first = Richard M. | title = American Folklore | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1977 | location = Chicago | isbn =  0-226-15859-4 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last several decades the term has generally fallen out of favor in [[folklore studies]] because it places an emphasis on origin instead of ongoing practice to determine authenticity.

The term ''fakelore'' was coined in 1950 by American folklorist [[Richard M. Dorson]].&lt;ref name="Dorson-1977-4" /&gt;  Dorson's examples included the fictional [[cowboy]] [[Pecos Bill]], who was presented as a folk hero of the [[American West]] but was actually invented by the writer [[Edward S. O'Reilly]] in 1923.  Dorson also regarded [[Paul Bunyan]] as fakelore.  Although Bunyan originated as a character in traditional tales told by loggers in the [[Great Lakes]] region of North America, [[James Stevens (musician)|James Stevens]], an ad writer working for the Red River Lumber Company, invented many of the stories about him that are known today.  According to Dorson, advertisers and popularizers turned Bunyan into a "pseudo folk hero of twentieth-century mass culture" who bore little resemblance to the original.&lt;ref name="Dorson-AmFolk-214"&gt;Dorson (1977), 214–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Folklorismus'', [[anglicized]] to '''folklorism''', also refers to the invention or adaptation of folklore.  Unlike fakelore, however, folklorism is not necessarily misleading; it includes any use of a tradition outside the cultural context in which it was created.  The term was first used in the early 1960s by German scholars, who were primarily interested in the use of folklore by the [[tourism industry]].  However, professional art based on folklore, TV commercials with [[fairy tale]] characters, and even academic studies of folklore are all forms of folklorism.&lt;ref name="Newall"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Newall | first = Venetia J. | title = The Adaptation of Folklore and Tradition (Folklorismus) | journal = Folklore | volume = 98 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–151 | publisher =  | year = 1987 | jstor=1259975 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1987.9716408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendirbaeva"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kendirbaeva | first = Gulnar | authorlink =  | title = Folklore and Folklorism in Kazakhstan | journal = Asian Folklore Studies | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–123 | publisher =  | year = 1994 | doi = 10.2307/1178561 | jstor=1178561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

The term ''fakelore'' is often used by those who seek to expose or debunk it, including Dorson himself, who spoke of a "battle against fakelore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dorson | first = Richard M. | title = Is Folklore a Discipline? | journal = Folklore | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–205 | year = 1973 | jstor=1259723 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1973.9716514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorson complained that popularizers had sentimentalized folklore, stereotyping the people who created it as quaint and whimsical&lt;ref name="Dorson-1977-4" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;– whereas the real thing was often "repetitive, clumsy, meaningless and obscene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dorson | first = Richard M. | title = Current Folklore Theories | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 101 | year = 1963 | doi = 10.1086/200339 | jstor=2739820
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He contrasted the genuine Paul Bunyan tales, which had been so full of technical logging terms that outsiders would find parts of them difficult to understand, with the commercialized versions, which sounded more like [[Children's literature|children's books]]. The original Paul Bunyan had been shrewd and sometimes ignoble; one story told how he cheated his men out of their pay. [[Media culture|Mass culture]] provided a sanitized Bunyan with a "spirit of gargantuan whimsy [that] reflects no actual mood of lumberjacks".&lt;ref name="Dorson-AmFolk-214" /&gt; Daniel G. Hoffman said that Bunyan, a folk hero, had been turned into a mouthpiece for capitalists: "This is an example of the way in which a traditional symbol has been used to manipulate the minds of people who had nothing to do with its creation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ball | first = John |author2=George Herzog|author3=Thelma James|author4=Louis C. Jones|author5=Melville J. Herskovits|author6=Wm. Hugh Jansen|author7=Richard M. Dorson|author8=Alvin W. Wolfe|author9=Daniel G. Hoffman | title = Discussion from the Floor | journal = Journal of American Folklore | volume = 72 | issue = 285 | pages = 233–241 | year = 1959 | jstor=538134 | doi = 10.2307/538134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that professionally created art and folklore are constantly influencing each other, and that this mutual influence should be studied rather than condemned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Olson | first = Jon | title = Film Reviews | journal = Western Folklore | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 233–237 | publisher =  | year = 1976 | jstor=1498351}} According to Newall, 133, the German folklorist Hermann Bausinger expressed a similar view.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jon Olson, a professor of anthropology, reported that while growing up he heard Paul Bunyan stories that had originated as lumber company advertising.&lt;ref name="Olson-235"&gt;Olson, 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorson had seen the effect of print sources on orally transmitted Paul Bunyan stories as a form of cross-contamination that "hopelessly muddied the lore".&lt;ref name="Dorson-AmFolk-214" /&gt; For Olson, however, "the point is that I personally was exposed to Paul Bunyan in the genre of a living oral tradition, not of lumberjacks (of which there are precious few remaining), but of the present people of the area."&lt;ref name="Olson-235" /&gt;  What was fakelore had become folklore again.

==Purported examples of the concept==
In addition to Paul Bunyan and Pecos Bill, Dorson identified the American folk hero [[Joe Magarac]] as fakelore.&lt;ref name="Dorson-AmFolk-214" /&gt;  Magarac, a fictional [[steelworker]], first appeared in 1931 in a ''[[Scribner's Magazine]]'' story by the writer Owen Francis.  He was a literal man of steel who made rails from molten metal with his bare hands; he refused an opportunity to marry in order to devote himself to working 24 hours a day, worked so hard that the mill had to shut down, and finally, in despair at enforced idleness, melted himself down in the mill's furnace in order to improve the quality of the steel.  Francis said he heard this story from immigrant steelworkers in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]; he reported that they told him the word ''magarac'' was a compliment, then laughed and talked to each other in their own language, which he did not speak.  The word actually means "jackass" in [[Serbo-Croatian]].  Since no trace of the existence of Joe Magarac stories prior to 1931 has been discovered, Francis's informants may have made the character up as a joke on him.  In 1998, Gilley and Burnett reported "only tentative signs that the Magarac story has truly made a substantive transformation from 'fake-' into 'folklore'", but noted his importance as a local cultural icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gilley | first = Jennifer |author2=Stephen Burnett | title = Deconstructing and Reconstructing Pittsburgh's Man of Steel: Reading Joe Magarac against the Context of the 20th-Century Steel Industry | journal = The Journal of American Folklore | volume = 111 | issue = 442 | pages = 392–408 |date=November 1998 | doi = 10.2307/541047 | jstor=541047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other American folk heroes that have been called fakelore include [[Old Stormalong]], [[Febold Feboldson]],&lt;ref name="Dorson-AmFolk-214" /&gt; [[Mose Humphrey|Big Mose]], [[Tony Beaver]], [[Bowleg Bill]], [[Wisakedjak|Whiskey Jack]], [[Annie Christmas]], [[Cordwood Pete]], [[Antonine Barada]], and [[Kemp Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;American Folklore: An Encyclopedia, ed. Jan Harold Brunvand, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996, p. 1105&lt;/ref&gt;  Marshall Fishwick describes these largely literary figures as imitations of [[Paul Bunyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fishwick | first = Marshall W. | title = Sons of Paul: Folklore or Fakelore? | journal = Western Folklore | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 277–286 | year = 1959 | doi = 10.2307/1497745 | jstor=1497745
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, scholar Michael I. Niman describes the [[Legend of the Rainbow Warriors]] - a belief that a "new tribe" will inherit the ways of the Native Americans and save the planet - as an example of fakelore.&lt;ref name="NIMAN"&gt;Niman, Michael I. 1997. ''People of the Rainbow: A Nomadic Utopia'', pp. 131-148. [[University of Tennessee Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87049-988-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4979">[[File:Baia das gatas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Baía das Gatas, home of the music festival]]The '''Festival de Baía das Gatas''' or the '''Baía das Gatas Festival''' and the '''Baía das Gatas Music Festival''' takes place on a full moon weekend in August in [[Baía das Gatas]], a village and a bay in the northeastern part of the island of [[São Vicente, Cape Verde|São Vicente]], Cape Verde.  It is the most popular music festival in Cape Verde and are likely being the first, in its early years, it was the only music festival in the country until the Festival de Gamboa which was established in 1992 in Praia in the island of Santiago.  It is nicknamed the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Africultures'', no. 26, March 2000, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was created in 1984 by musician and composer [[Vasco Martins]] and his friends,&lt;ref name="Requedaz and Delucchi"&gt;{{harvnb|Requedaz and Delucchi|2011|pp=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was done at a budget of 180 million escudos and equipment limited to 150 watts.,&lt;ref name="Monteiro"&gt;{{harvnb|Monteiro|1998|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; also it was founded by [[Djô d'Eloy]] whose actual name was José Rodrigues Silva  In the first year, musicians came from [[Mindelo]], it would draw people from other islands in Cape Verde and the diaspora.  In the 1990s, foreigners and outsiders would visit the festival.&lt;ref name="Monteiro"/&gt;  Since that time, the budget has increased twenty times&lt;ref name="Monteiro"/&gt; and more than 15,000 people took part each year.&lt;ref name="Requedaz and Delucchi"/&gt;  The most popular guest was [[Cesária Évora]], native of the island, the greatest contributor to the event.&lt;ref name="Requedaz and Delucchi"/&gt;  [[Manuel de Novas]] appeared several times, his most notable was in 2003.&lt;ref name="de Novas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caboverdeonline.com/contents/Port/2003/G/04/mn041503.asp|title=Homenagem a Manuel de Novas na Baía das Gatas|trans-title=Hommage to Manuel de Novas at Baía das Gatas|publisher=[[Cabo Verde Online]]|language=pt|date=August 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219033211/http://www.caboverdeonline.com/contents/Port/2003/G/04/mn041503.asp|archivedate=2008-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 28th edition held in 2012 had several artists including [[Val Xalino|Val]] and his son [[Roberto Xalino|Roberto]] singing songs in memory of Cesária Évora, the greatest Cape Verdean singer.&lt;ref name="SAPO CV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://festivais.sapo.cv/baia-das-gatas/noticias/28-edicao-do-festival-conheca-o-cartaz-189574|title=28° edição do festival conheca o cartaz|newspaper=SAPO CV|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a documentary film directed by Alexis Tsafas titled ''The Music Cape'' was released and is about the music festival that went in Baia das Gatas up to 2004.

==Organization==
The festival takes part in a full moon weekend in August and is held for three days.&lt;ref name="Requedaz and Delucchi"/&gt;  It is organized by the island mayor,&lt;ref name="Monteiro"/&gt; unlike other music festivals, the admissions are free.&lt;ref name="Requedaz and Delucchi"/&gt;

Music events are complemented with horse racing, water sports and dances and the election of "Miss Baía".&lt;ref name="Requedaz and Delucchi"/&gt;

[[File:Henry Barber on Savage Journey (1975) - 11.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Barber (rock climber)|Henry Barber]] on first ascent of ''Savage Journey'' at Lost World, [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mt. Wellington]], [[Tasmania]], 1975]]
In [[mountaineering]], a '''first ascent''' (abbreviated to '''FA''' in guidebooks) is the first successful, documented attainment of the top of a mountain, or the first to follow a particular [[climbing route]]. First mountain ascents are notable because they  entail genuine exploration, with greater risks, challenges, and recognition than climbing a route pioneered by others. The person who performs the '''first ascent''' is called the '''first ascensionist'''. 

In [[free climbing]], a first ascent (or [[Notable first free ascents|first free ascent]], abbreviated '''FFA''') of a climbing route is the first successful, documented climb of a route without using equipment such as anchors or ropes for aiding progression or resting. 

== History ==
The details of the first ascents of even many prominent mountains are scanty or unknown; sometimes the only evidence of prior summiting is a [[cairn]], artifacts, or inscriptions at the top.  Today, first ascents are generally carefully recorded and usually mentioned in guidebooks.

Overwhelmingly, the idea of a "first ascent" is a modern one, especially in places such as [[Africa]] and [[Americas|the Americas]] with a history of colonialism. There may be little or no physical evidence or documentation about the climbing activities of indigenous peoples living near the mountain. For example, the volcano [[Llullaillaco]] on the border of [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] is known to have been climbed in the prehistoric period due to the presence of [[Incas|Incan]] artifacts at the summit, yet credit for the first recorded ascent is given to Chilean climbers Bión González and Juan Harseim, who summited in 1952.

The term is also used when referring to ascents made using a specific technique or taking a specific route, such as via the North Face, without ropes or without oxygen.

== Related terms ==
In rock climbing, some of the earlier first ascents, particularly for difficult routes, involved a mix of [[free climbing|free]] and [[aid climbing]]. As a result, purist free climbers have developed the designation '''[[Notable first free ascents|first free ascent]]''' ('''FFA''') to acknowledge ascents intentionally made more challenging by using equipment for protection only.

'''Second ascents''' are also noteworthy in climbing circles, frequently involving improving on a pioneering route through lessons learned from it, experience which may span from technical improvements to having a better understanding of how much gear and provisions to take.

Some other "first ascents" could be recorded for particular mountains or routes. One is the First Winter Ascent, which is, as the name easily suggests, the first ascent made during winter season. This is most important where the climate of [[winter]] is a factor in increasing the difficulty grade of the route (higher elevation, polar latitudes). In the [[Northern Hemisphere]] conventional winter ascents are made between December 21 and March 21 and are not related to the conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web13w/newswire-suser-gjennom-harryland|title=Disputed First Winter Ascent of Aid Line Claimed on Troll Wall|publisher=alpinist.com|date=6 February 2013|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the Himalayan area, although Nepal and China's winter season permits start on December 1, the conventional winter ascents begin on December 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mounteverest.net/story/ExWebseriesThemeaningofwinterin8000climbingNov162004.shtml|title=ExWeb series: The meaning of winter in 8000+ climbing|publisher=mounteverest.com|date=16 November 2004|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaj.americanalpineclub.org/climbs-and-expeditions/asia/tibet/2010-definition-of-winter-ascents-in-tibet-china-nepal-by-l-griffin/|title=2010: Definition of winter ascents in Tibet, China, Nepal, by L. Griffin|publisher=americanalpineclub.org|first=Lindsay|last=Griffin|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another is the First Solo Ascent, which is the first ascent made by a single climber. This is most important on high-level rock climbing, when the climber has to provide his own security (self-belaying) or even when climbing without any protection at all (often recorded as First Free Solo Ascent). Another type of ascent, also known as FFA (not to be confused with First Free Ascent as listed above) is the first female ascent. While not generally considered as important, this designation remains significant on some difficult, limit-pushing climbs, where the first female ascent may not happen until well after the FA, due to possible difficulties encountered by female physicality.

The term '''last ascent''' has been used to refer to an ascent of a mountain or face that has subsequently changed to such an extent – often because of rockfall – that the route no longer exists (e.g., the south-west face of the [[Aiguille du Dru]] in the [[Alps]]). It can also be used facetiously to refer to a climb that is so unpleasant or unaesthetic (due to loose rock, excessive brush, poor route selection, etc.) that no one would ever willingly repeat the first ascent party's ordeal.

In [[physical cosmology]], the '''hadron epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early universe during which the mass of the universe was dominated by [[hadron]]s. It started approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]], when the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow the [[quark]]s from the preceding [[quark epoch]] to bind together into hadrons. Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and anti-matter in [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in [[annihilation]] reactions, leaving a small residue of hadrons. The elimination of anti-hadrons was completed by one second after the Big Bang, when the following [[lepton epoch]] began.

'''Hyena-baiting''' is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[animal-baiting|baiting]] of [[hyenas]]. 

==History==
The [[striped hyena]] has historically been the most frequently used species. Hyenas can be challenging opponents for dogs, as their jaws are exceedingly powerful. A single bite from a hyena lasting a few seconds without holding on is sufficient to kill a large dog.&lt;ref&gt;''Sketches of Indian Field Sports: With Observations on the Animals; Also an Account of Some of the Customs of the Inhabitants; with a Description of the Art of Catching Serpents, as Practised by the Conjoors and Their Method of Curing Themselves when Bitten: with Remarks on Hydrophobia and Rabid Animals'' by [[Daniel Johnson (surgeon)|Daniel Johnson]], published by R. Jennings, 1827&lt;/ref&gt; Hyenas apparently fight dogs by trying to cripple them by biting at their legs.&lt;ref&gt;''Elements of geology: including fossil botany and palaeontology. A popular treatise on the most interesting parts of the science. Designed for the use of schools and general readers''
By John Lee Comstock

432 pages&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Qalandar (clan)|Qalandar]] and the Thori in southern [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Kandahar]] and [[Quetta]], catch striped hyenas in order to pit them against specially trained dogs. The hyenas are restrained with ropes in order to pull them away from the dogs if necessary.&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/afs/pdf/a1246.pdf | title = The Magicality of the Hyena: Beliefs and Practices in West and South Asia | publisher = Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 57, 1998: 331–344 | accessdate = 23 | date = June 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625072539/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/afs/pdf/a1246.pdf | archivedate = 2008-06-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]], captured hyenas sometimes had [[bridle]]s placed in their mouths in order to prevent them from injuring the dogs. This was done in order to train the dogs into not fearing the animal.&lt;ref name="Magic" /&gt;
It is known that a [[Dogue de Bordeaux]] bitch named Megre was pitted against hyenas in 1895, though the exact species was not identified.&lt;ref name="Dogue"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bulldoginformation.com/evolution-of-the-bulldog.html | title = The Dogue de Bordeaux | publisher = The Bulldog Information Library | accessdate = 03 |date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and promotion==
[[File:Sony CentreforthePerformingArts.jpg|thumb|right|Toronto's [[Sony Centre for the Performing Arts]] in 2010]]

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] described the program as "male singers putting a new spin on dozens of love songs traditionally performed by a man and a woman, or by a man singing about a woman".&lt;ref name=CBC/&gt; It premiered on June 14, 2014 at the [[Sony Centre for the Performing Arts]], during Luminato's closing weekend, and was billed as a "prelude" to Toronto's [[WorldPride]] event, which took place during June 20–29 and replaced annual [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Pride Week]] events for the year.&lt;ref name=Knelman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Criger/&gt; WorldPride also serves a concert partner.&lt;ref name=Knelman/&gt;&lt;ref name=WPT&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpridetoronto.com/news/luminato-festival-presents-a-special-one-night-only-performance-in-celebration-of-worldpride-2014-toronto|title=Luminato Festival presents a special one-night only performance in celebration of WorldPride 2014 Toronto|date=April 8, 2014|accessdate=April 8, 2014|publisher=WorldPride Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concert was officially confirmed on April 8, 2014 by Weisbrodt during a news conference about the festival. Wainwright and Weisbrodt had previously announced the show during an exclusive party they hosted.&lt;ref name=Knelman/&gt; In promoting the concert, Weisbrodt said:

{{Quote|text=What Rufus has put together for this evening of celebrating love is simply mind- boggling and something I would not have been able to pull off as the artistic director by myself. It promises to be one of the most unusual nights of music. Who doesn't want to hear these artists sing together? ''If I Loved You'' is not about turning something from "straight" to "gay," by singing love duets with only men, but instead, to declare the universality of love, and to celebrate love that comes in every shade.&lt;ref name=BroadwayWorld/&gt;}}

Luminato promoted the event with the following description:
{{Quote|text=Rufus Wainwright teams with Grammy and Tony-winning music director Stephen Oremus to redefine dozens of the most beloved gems in the Great American Songbook, all love songs from Broadway musicals. Wainwright’s recontextualizations, performed exclusively by men and to men, fortify the songs’ universality as expressions of love. The groundbreaking evening will showcase Wainwright and an international spectrum of pop, jazz and musical theatre stars in unexpected, entirely enchanting pairs.&lt;ref name=Luminato/&gt;&lt;ref name=BroadwayWorld/&gt;}}

In a press release also issued on April 8, a spokesperson for WorldPride said, "You can never underestimate the power of seeing yourself reflected in art, and how important that is to a feeling of belonging. WorldPride 2014 Toronto will showcase a rich range of LGBTQ art and voices from across the world in a once-in-a-lifetime event. We are delighted to partner with a cultural icon like the Luminato Festival to celebrate Toronto’s vibrant arts community and bring focus on global LGBTQ struggles and triumphs."&lt;ref name=BroadwayWorld/&gt;&lt;ref name=WPT/&gt; Tickets went on sale the week of news conference.&lt;ref name=Knelman/&gt; [[Boy George]]'s participation was confirmed on his official website, which also noted that the concert would take place on his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boygeorgeuk.com/wordpress/luminato-festival-special-guest/|title=Luminato Festival – Special Guest|accessdate=April 9, 2014|publisher=BoyGeorgeUK.com|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show included a full Broadway orchestra, [[Conducting|conducted]] by music director [[Stephen Oremus]],&lt;ref name=Luminato/&gt; and performances by Wainwright and special guests Boy George, [[David Byrne]], [[Josh Groban]] and [[Steven Page]].&lt;ref name=Knelman&gt;{{cite news|last=Knelman|first=Martin|title=In Luminato world premiere, men sing love songs to men|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2014/04/08/in_luminato_world_premiere_men_sing_love_songs_to_men.html|accessdate=April 9, 2014|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Star Media Group]]|date=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also scheduled to appear are counter-tenor Brennan Hall, [[Brent Carver]], [[Glen Hansard]], [[Ezra Koenig]] and [[Andrew Rannells]].&lt;ref name=Knelman/&gt; Some of the songs were written by gay men, including [[Noël Coward]], [[Lorenz Hart]],&lt;ref name=BroadwayWorld/&gt; [[Jerry Herman]] and [[Cole Porter]].&lt;ref name=Knelman/&gt;

==Reception==
Prior to the concert, the ''Toronto Star'' said, "One thing we can be sure of is that, to borrow a phrase from one famous song, this could be the start of something big... After its Toronto premiere, it’s safe to assume ''If I Loved You'' will head for New York, the Hollywood Bowl and London".&lt;ref name=Knelman/&gt; The paper's entertainment contributor Martin Knelman predicted that the concert would sell out "in record time".&lt;ref name=Knelman/&gt;

'''''Jesse James''''' is a [[Lucky Luke]] comic written by [[Goscinny]] and illustrated by [[Morris (comics)|Morris]]. The original French edition was printed in 1969 by [[Dargaud]]. English editions of this French series have been published by [[Dargaud]], Cinebook. Brockhampton Press and Tara Press. It is based on the true story of [[Jesse James]] (1847–1882).

==Plot==
In 1880, the story begins with [[Jesse James]], who idolizes and tries to emulate [[Robin Hood]], but somehow he is not able to clearly define the line between the rich he is supposed to rob and the poor he is supposed to help. With the help of his [[Shakespeare]] aficionado brother [[Frank James|Frank]], he therefore simply redefines the term "poor" for his own benefit, and along with [[Cole Younger]] the two begin robbing trains en masse, forcing Lucky Luke to move out and stop them with the somewhat inept assistance of two [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton detectives]].

'''Ken Ring''' is a writer from [[Auckland]], New Zealand, who asserts that he can use lunar cycles to predict weather and earthquakes. He terms his predictions "alternative weather" and has authored books about the weather and climate. Ring publishes almanacs each year for New Zealand, Australia and Ireland in which he provides weather predictions for the entire year. His New Zealand almanac covers 64 towns.&lt;ref name = "Lang"/&gt; Ring's methods are unscientific and have been widely criticised as fake and pseudoscience by many scientists in the fields of meteorology and geology.&lt;ref name = Keir/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsJunS11&gt;{{cite news |author= Agence France-Presse |title= Scientists slam ‘Moonman’ earthquake predictor |work= physorg.com |date= 3 March 2011 |url= http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-03-scientists-slam-moonman-earthquake-predictor.html|accessdate= 5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ring says he predicted the [[2010 Christchurch earthquake|4 September 2010 Christchurch earthquake]] and the deadly [[February 2011 Christchurch earthquake|22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake]].&lt;ref name = "tweet"/&gt; He also said there would probably be an earthquake in Marlborough or north Canterbury "just before noon" on 20 March 2011.&lt;ref name=Ring_March2011/&gt; This caused some residents to leave Christchurch and led to criticism from scientists and sceptics.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; Further research into his predictions showed that his forecasting record did not hold up under scrutiny.&lt;ref name=SillyBeliefs01&gt;{{cite news |author= John at SillyBeliefs.com |title= Ken Ring did NOT predict the Sept Christchurch earthquake  |work= sillybeliefs.com |date= 23 Feb 2011 |url= http://www.sillybeliefs.com/ring-rc-3.html#commentring-1|accessdate= 22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predicting weather ==

Ring is known for attempting to predict weather and authors books on "how the moon affects the weather", which include an almanac each year for New Zealand (since 1999), Australia (since 2006) and Ireland (since 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/blame-it-on-the-moon-says-longrange-forecaster/2006/07/23/1153593211117.html |title=Blame it on the moon, says long-range forecaster |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |author=Richard Macey |date=24 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kiwi weatherman offers ray of summer sunshine |url= http://www.independent.ie/farming/news-features/kiwi-weatherman-offers-ray-of-summer-sunshine-2043447.html |author=Martin Ryan |work=Independent.ie |date=2 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that the cycle of weather follows a lunar pattern and can be used to predict weather many years in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.predictweather.co.nz/Default.aspx |title=The home of long range weather |work=Predict Weather |accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lunar precession|lunar cycle]] occurs every 9 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Lunar Markings on Fajada Butte, Chaco Canyon, New Mexico |author=A.

== Earthquake prediction ==

Ring [[earthquake prediction|predicts earthquakes]] based on the position of the moon. On his website he says that when the moon (in particular the [[new moon]]) is at [[perigee]] (closest to the earth) it may affect the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and alter the [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]]. It may also draw the [[Van Allen Belt]] closer, attracting [[Particle radiation|radioactively charged particles]] towards Earth. Ring believes this combination may be responsible for earthquakes and volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.predictweather.co.nz/ArticleShow.aspx?ID=316&amp;type=home |title=Can earthquakes be predicted? |date=25 October 2010 |author=Ken Ring |work=Predict Weather |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ring has predicted 221 days of increased earthquake risk for New Zealand in 2011&lt;ref name = "WTA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.times-age.co.nz/local/news/ring-prediction-dismissed/3945176/ |work=Wairarapa Times-Age |title=Ring prediction dismissed |author=Nathan Crombie |date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than half of the time between the start of January and the end of March as earthquake risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ken Ring: Can he actually predict earthquakes? |date=17 March 2011 |author=Dan Satherley |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Ken-Ring-Can-he-actually-predict-earthquakes/tabid/1160/articleID/202642/Default.aspx |work=3 News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his weekly Radio Waatea broadcast on 3 September 2010 he said "you’ll be reading about floods and winds and earthquakes and snow over the next week or so, particularly the South Island".&lt;ref name = "tweet"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Valentines-Day-tweet-predicted-Christchurch-quake-Ken-Ring/tabid/423/articleID/199449/Default.aspx |title=Valentine's Day tweet predicted Christchurch quake?

{{quote|The morning of 20 March 2011 sees the South island again in a big earthquake risk for all the same reasons. This date is the closest fly-past the moon does in all of 2011. The node arrives on the 20th at 9.44am. As that date coincides with lunar equinox this will probably be an east/west faultline event this time, and therefore should be more confined to a narrower band of latitude. The only east/west fault lines in NZ are in Marlborough and N Canterbury. All factors should come together for a moon-shot straight through the centre of the earth and targeting NZ.

Just what would qualify as a "severe weather event"? Will it really be "worldwide" – as in the sense of "global" – or is this statement intentionally broad so that any instance of severe weather on March 20th, anywhere in the world, could thus count as a 'correct' prediction? (What ''is'' "severe", anyway?) I have asked Ken for clarification on this, on the SciBlogs mirror of my blog, but so far – despite him saying there that "I never shy away from questions" – I’m afraid I’ve had no further clarification.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The problem is though, that such vaguely worded 'predictions', with their lack of precision, are so wide open that they lend themselves to confirmation bias. – Alison Campbell, March 2011&lt;ref name=campbell_1_Mar/&gt;}}

One such example of confirmation bias is a Ring prediction from 2011, which was reported in an article for local Wellington newspaper, the Upper Hutt Leader.  On 14 November 2016, Kaikoura and Wellington city experienced a M7.8 earthquake. Ring was quoted in 2011 as saying "I do expect earthquake activity exceeding 7 on the Richter to come about every 11 to 13 years, as they have done in Wellington in February 1893, August 1904, August 1917, July 1929, August 1942, May 1968 and May 1992. As the last in the series of above-7s was in 1992 we can reasonably expect a 7 mag between 2013 and 2016,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/upper-hutt-leader/5733582/Moon-Man-predicts-big-quake-by-2016 |title=Moon Man predicts big quake by 2016 |date=5 October 2011 |work=Upper Hutt Leader |publisher=Upper Hutt Leader |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing a full four-year window for an earthquake to occur, making the "prediction" useless.

The Collection was started by Tatiana Kolodzei in Moscow during the late 1960s at the height of the Cold War. In 2006, the Kolodzei Collection of Russian and Eastern European Art was recognized by ''Art and Antiques Magazine'' as one of the top 100 collectors in the United States (''[[Art &amp; Antiques|Art and Antiques]]'', March 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;101–102).

There are now over 300 artists in the Kolodzei Collection of Russian and Eastern European Art.

There are artists of the 1980s and 1990s such as [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]], Andrei Budaev, Shimon Okshteyn, [[Dimitry Gerrman]], Farid Bogdalov, Asya Dodina, Slava Polishchuk, Olga Bulgakova, Valerii and Natasha Cherkashin, Irina Danilova, Genia Chef, Leonid Borisov, Andrei Karpov, Evgenii Gorokhovskii, Sergei Volokhov, Valery Koshlyakov, Sergei Mironenko, Andrei Filipov, Semen Agroskin, Mamut Churlu, Tatiana Antoshina, and others.

==Founders==

Tatiana Kolodzei, along with supporters from the US and Europe (including [[Norton Dodge]]), formed the Kolodzei Art Foundation shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Tatiana's daughter, Natalia Kolodzei (an Honorary Member of the [[Russian Academy of Arts]]), is the Executive Director.  ''[[Robb Report]]'' called Natalia Kolodzei "the person to know" regarding Russian art, and "one of the most influential of Russia's young cultural figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robbreport.com/Bear-Essentials.aspx|title=Bear Essentials|website=The Best Luxury Cars, Jets, Yachts, Travel, Watches {{!}} Robb Report|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, Natalia Kolodzei was featured in The Robb 50 Connoisseurs: Art; Robb Report, October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://robbreport.com/paid-issue/natalia-kolodzei|title=Natalia Kolodzei|website=The Best Luxury Cars, Jets, Yachts, Travel, Watches {{!}} Robb Report|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">The '''Lindsey Creek French Tree''' is the [[Largest organisms|largest single-stem organism (tree)]] thus far known to have existed historically. It was a coast redwood (also known as California redwood), a member of the species ''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]''. It grew in [[Fieldbrook, California]], along the Lindsey Creek, which feeds into the [[Mad River (California)|Mad River]].&lt;ref name="Landmark"&gt;[http://www.landmarktrees.net/latest.html ''Latest Tree News'', Michael Taylor]&lt;/ref&gt; When it was uprooted and felled by a storm in 1905, its mass was at least 3,630 [[short tons]], 3.3 million [[kilograms]], or 7.26 million [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]; and its [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] [[volume]] was at least 2,550 cubic meters (90,000 cubic feet).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110704042216/http://www.zilkha.com/2010/10/15/the-most-massive-tree/ ''The Most Massive Tree'', Zilkha Biomass Energy]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of volume, this would make it close to twice the size of the largest living single-stem tree, the [[giant sequoia]] known as [[General Sherman (tree)|General Sherman]].

Skip Johnson, a [[Fieldbrook, California|Fieldbrook]] logger interviewed in 1971, testified that he witnessed the Lindsey Creek Tree after it was lying on the ground. He reported it as the tallest tree in Fieldbrook. He stated that a family member measured its diameter at 19 feet at 130 feet off the ground, and 9.5 feet at 260 feet off the ground, and its total height slightly exceeded 390 feet.  If true, it was taller than any other known tree.  [[Hyperion (tree)|Hyperion]], another coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), currently the world's tallest tree, is no less than 115.72 m (379.7 feet) tall.&lt;ref name="Landmark" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14157">The [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] from the east took place over the course of three centuries, from the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[early modern period]].

The terms ''Tatars'' or ''Tartars'' are applied to nomadic [[Mongols|Mongolic peoples]] who, themselves, were conquered by Mongols and incorporated into their horde. They were mainly composed of [[Kipchaks]]-[[Cuman people]].

[[Mongols|Mongol]]-[[Tatars|Tatar]] [[Golden Horde]] forces led by [[Batu Khan]], (a grandson of [[Genghis Khan]]), began attacking Europe in 1223, starting with [[Cumans]], [[Volga Bulgaria]] and [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]]. They destroyed many [[Rus' (region)|Rus]] cities including [[Kiev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html|title=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120530043944/https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and [[Moscow]] in the process, sparing [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]] however. They originally planned to continue all the way to the shores of the "Great Sea" ([[Atlantic Ocean]]). However, upon learning of the death of [[Ögedei Khan]] (third son of Genghis Khan, uncle of Batu Khan) in 1241 they returned eastwards to their steppe homelands. This, it could be argued, saved the rest of Europe from suffering the catastrophes that befell the armies and towns of Poland and Hungary, although over-stretched lines of communication and the lack of vast open tracts of pasture land might well have proved the undoing of such a venture.

* 1347: The [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]], a great trade emporium on the [[Crimean Peninsula]], came under siege by an army of [[Mongol]] warriors under the command of [[Janibeg]]. An [[epidemic]] of [[bubonic plague]] had been ravaging [[Central Asia]] before the conflict in Caffa. Brought across the [[Silk Road]], the Mongols used disease infected corpses as a [[biological weapon]]. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Svat Soucek. ''A History of Inner Asia''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-65704-0}}. P. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The Genoese traders fled, transferring the plague via their ships into the south of Europe, whence it rapidly spread. It is estimated that between one-quarter and two-thirds of [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]] died from the outbreak of the [[Black Death]] between 1348 and 1350.

* 1521: The combined forces of Crimean Khan Mehmed Giray and his Kazan allies attacked Moscow and captured thousands of [[slavery|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=The_Crimean_Khanate|title=The Tatar Khanate of Crimea -  All Empires|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1552 Russian Moscow state 110,000 army with Kasym state 40,000 army occupied Kazan kahanate 30,000 army.
* 1571: The Crimean khan [[Devlet I Giray]] [[Crimean Tatars invasion into Russia in 1571|devastated Moscow]] with a horde of 120,000 horsemen.
* 1599: Tatar forces invaded, invading [[Lwów]] and [[Tarnopol]], but were beaten back by [[Cossack]] forces.

From 1599 the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] suffered a series of Tatar invasions, the goal of which was to loot, pillage and capture slaves into [[slavery|jasyr]]. The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people, predominantly [[Ukrainians]] but also [[Circassians]], [[Russians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Poles]], were captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate. A constant threat from [[Crimean Tatars]] supported the appearance of [[Cossack]]dom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/Soldier_Khan.php|title=Avalanche Press|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/2005/04/the_living_legacy_of_jihad_sla.html|title=Articles: The living legacy of jihad slavery|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years the [[Khanate of Kazan|Khanates of Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] routinely raided Rus principalities for slaves and to plunder towns. Russian chronicles record about 40 raids of [[List of Kazan khans|Kazan Khans]] on the Russian territories in the first half of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Full Collection of the Russian Annals, vol.13, SPb, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muscovy]] was also being invaded by the [[Nogai Horde]] and [[Crimean Khanate]] which were successors of the [[Golden Horde]].

In the beginning of the 16th century the wild steppe began near old [[Ryazan]] on the [[Oka River]] and Elets on the Sosna, inflow of the [[Don River, Russia|Don]]. Crimean Tatars chose to proceed along watersheds for their incursions.  The main way to Moscow was "[[Muravsky Trail|Muravski shliach]]", from the Crimean Perekop up to [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] between the rivers of two basins, Dnieper and Northern [[Donets]]. Having penetrated deep in the populated areas about 100-200 kilometers, the Tatars turned back and, having unwrapped wide wings, looted and captured slaves. Until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive [[slave trade]] with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Captives were sold to Turkey and the Middle East. In [[Crimea]], about 75% of the population consisted of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157|title=Welcome to Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crimean city of [[Caffa]] was the main [[slavery|slave market]].

Annually, Moscow mobilized in the spring up to 65,000 soldiers for boundary service. The defensive lines were applied, consisting of a circuit of fortresses and cities. [[Cossacks]] and young noblemen were organized into sentry and patrol services that observed [[Crimean Tatars]] and nomads of Nogai Horde on the steppe. About 30 major Tatar raids were recorded into [[Tsardom of Russia|Muscovite]] territories between 1558-1596.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html|title=Inalcik. Servile Labor|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect from the invasions of the [[Nogai Horde]] between the [[Volga River|Volga]] and [[Irtysh]] rivers, the Volga cities of [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] in 1586, [[Tsaritsyn]] in 1589, [[Saratov]] in 1590 were founded.

The [[Crimean Khanate]] was one of the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the 18th century. The Russian population of the borderland suffered annual Tatar invasions and tens of thousands of soldiers were required to protect the southern boundaries. This was a heavy burden for the state, and slowed its social and economic development. Since Crimean Tatars did not permit settlement of Russians to southern regions where the soil is better and the season is long enough, Muscovy had to depend on poorer regions and labour-intensive agriculture. [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] were also subjected to extensive slave raiding. The Crimean Khanate was conquered by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1783, bringing an end to Mongol and Tatar rule in Europe. 
The [[Turkic migration|Turkic]] invasion in [[Anatolia]] (previously populated by some European nations), [[Cyprus]] and the [[Balkans]] remains unchanged.

Historians estimate that up to half of Hungary's two million population at that time were victims of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-34789/Hungary|title=Hungary - history - geography|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of the [[Kievan Rus|Russian]] population may have died during the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parallelsixty.com/history-russia.shtml|title=History of Russia from Early Slavs history and Kievan Rus to Romanovs dynasty|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin McEvedy]] (''Atlas of World Population History, 1978'') estimates the population of Russia-in-Europe dropped by 500,000 people, from 7.5 to 7 million in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#Mongol|title=WAR STATS REDIRECT|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas of Poland more than 70% of the population was slaughtered, e.g. at the silver mines of Rosperk (Rozbark), next to [[Bytom]] while one of the (at least) two raids around 75% were killed and the looted silver was used to build the massive Silver Tree fountain of [[Karakorum]].

'''May Week''' is the name used in the [[University of Cambridge]] to refer to a period at the end of the academic year. Originally May Week took place in the week during May before year-end exams began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May Week: balls, boats and bubbly|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/archive-centre/archive-month/july-2011.html|website=King's College, Cambridge|accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, May Week takes place in June after exams, and is a cause for great celebration amongst the students of the University. Highlights of the week include [[Bumps race|Bumps races]], [[May Ball]]s, [[June Event]]s and [[garden party|garden parties]].

==History==

May Week festivities were originally held in May, in the final week before exams; however, the May boat races, also known as the [[May Bumps]], moving toward June, right after exams to celebrate the year end.&lt;ref&gt;"We had a Ball" - William Ham Bevan. Cambridge Alumni Magazine, Issue 72 (Easter 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide Sunday==
''Suicide Sunday'' is the name used at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] to refer to the Sunday immediately after the end of the spring term (known as Easter Term). By this Sunday, all students have finished exams but most of the results have not been published, so it is traditionally a period of nerves and suspense. The name, however, refers to the celebration that students haven't committed suicide due to stress of exams.{{fact|date=May 2012}} The event is for current students of the University of Cambridge but is frequented by former students that indulge in the student lifestyle. A student-led campaign in 2015 encouraged use of the name "MayWeek Sunday" instead, though "Suicide Sunday" continues to persist among some students and the public.

The Cardboard Boat Race is a main attraction to Suicide Sunday, offering an alternative to the many garden parties and more serious boating. The first race was in 2010, with three boats from Magdalene College (The Galleon - Graham Forrest, Konrad Newton and Peter O'Brien; The Canoe - Doug Byatt, Matthew Schabas and Dominic White; Skippy - Ian Drummond, Julian Wesolowski and Tom Wilson). In 2011, the race was opened to other colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2011 Cardboard Boat Race |url=https://www.facebook.com/events/822698074443954/ |website=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ka Hula Piko'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] means the "center of the hula dance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/molokai/things-to-do/attractions/molokai-ka-hula-piko/|title=Molokai Ka Hula Piko - Aloha Hawaii|last=Travel|first=Aloha Condos -|work=Aloha Hawaii|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first festival was in 1991 by the Molokai Visitors Association and [[John Kaimikaua]], a [[Kumu Hula]]. It is currently organized by the Halau Hula o Kukunaokala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mauinow.com/2016/05/31/molokai-ka-hula-piko-celebrates-milestone-anniversary/|title=Maui Now: Moloka’i Ka Hula Piko Celebrates Milestone Anniversary|work=Maui Now  {{!}}  Moloka’i Ka Hula Piko Celebrates Milestone Anniversary|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is held in annually in Kaana because according to Hawaiian legend, [[Laka]], now regarded as the goddess of hula, created hula at Pu'u Nana, a sacred hill in Kaana, before spreading the art form across the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.discover-oahu.com/History-Of-Hula.html|title=History Of Hula|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Festival ==
The festival begins with an early-morning ceremony at Puʻu Nana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/events/moloka-i-ka-hula-piko/a/poi-fes/1299463/1006041|title=Molokaʻi Ka Hula Piko|website=www.lonelyplanet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then continues with a [[ho'olaule'a]], lectures, and other activities intended to educate and spread awareness of hula as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themolokaidispatch.com/ka-hula-piko-festival-2012/|title=Ka Hula Piko Festival 2012 {{!}} The Molokai Dispatch|date=2012-04-25|work=The Molokai Dispatch|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jessica Marie Lunsford''' (October 6, 1995 &amp;ndash; February 27, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] nine-year-old girl from [[Homosassa, Florida|Homosassa]], [[Florida]], who was [[murdered]] in February 2005. Lunsford was [[Child abduction|abducted]] from her home in the early morning of February 24, 2005, by [[John Couey]], a 46-year-old convicted [[sex offender]] who lived nearby. Couey held her captive over the weekend, during which she was [[raped]] and later murdered by being [[buried alive]]. The media extensively covered the investigation and trial of Couey. 

Lunsford's murder became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' that influenced the introduction of legislation in Florida known as [[Jessica's Law]], designed to protect potential victims and reduce a sexual offender's ability to re-offend, which has since influenced similar legislation in forty-two other states.

On August 24, 2007, a judge in [[Inverness, Florida|Inverness]] convicted Couey for the [[kidnapping]], [[Sexual battery#United States|sexual battery]], and [[Murder (United States law)#Florida|first degree murder]] of Lunsford, and sentenced him to [[Capital punishment|death]]. However, Couey died of [[natural causes]] in 2009, before his sentence could be carried out.

==Investigation==
Jessica Lunsford disappeared in the night on February 24, 2005, from her home in [[Homosassa, Florida]], and after approximately three weeks of intense searching for her around the area of her home, John Evander Couey was arrested in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], for an outstanding warrant of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] possession, but was released after questioning because it was only a local warrant.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Mabel. [http://www.ocala.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060701/NEWS/60701001/-1/news17 "Judge throws out Couey confession"], ''The Ocala Star Banner'', July 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Couey was a 46-year-old long-time resident of Homosassa with an extensive [[criminal record]], listing dozens of arrests for [[burglary]] and was a convicted child [[sex offender]]. Due to the laws at the time, Couey received only short sentences and was not monitored after release, despite his record of being an experienced [[trespasser]] and his repeated sexual offenses against children.

On March 12, Couey was arrested in [[Augusta, Georgia]], at the request of the [[Citrus County]] Sheriff's Office, for questioning about Lunsford's disappearance due to his residence on West Snowbird Court in Homosassa, only 65 yards from Lunsford's home, and his criminal record. Couey stated he did not have anything to do with the girl's disappearance and had moved to Georgia to find a job, only knowing about it from the television news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ANSWER BRIEF OF APPELLEE |url = http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/summaries/briefs/07/07-1636/Filed_04-27-2009_State_Answer_Brief.pdf|website = www.floridasupremecourt.org|accessdate = 2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from police custody after being interviewed.

On March 14, Couey's half-sister Dorothy Dixon gave permission to police to search her trailer at West Snowbird Court in Homosassa. Couey had lived at the West Snowbird Court residence with Dixon, her boyfriend Matt Dittrich, her daughter and son–in-law, Madie and Gene Secord, and her two-year-old grandson, Joshua. During the search a blood-stained [[mattress]] and pillows were found in Couey's [[closet]] in his room, and forensic analysis discovered both Couey's and Lunsford's [[DNA]] on the mattress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ANSWER BRIEF OF APPELLEE |url = http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/summaries/briefs/07/07-1636/Filed_04-27-2009_State_Answer_Brief.pdf|website = www.floridasupremecourt.org|accessdate = 2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On March 17, Couey was arrested and charged with the murder of Jessica Lunsford, and transported to the Citrus County jail in [[Florida]].

===Couey's confession===
On March 18, 2005, Couey made an audio-recorded and videotaped [[confession (legal)|confession]] to having [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]], [[rape|raped]] and [[murder|murdered]] Lunsford.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0607/11/ng.01.html Partial transcript of Video Confession of Couey], CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In his confession, Couey said that he had previously seen Lunsford playing in her yard and thought she was "about six years
old." On the night of the abduction, Couey had intended to just burglarize the Lunsford's home, but saw Jessica and "acted on impulse and he took her." He entered Lunsford's house at about three o'clock in the morning through an unlocked door, awakened Lunsford, told her "Don't yell or nothing", and told her to follow him out of the house.&lt;ref name=courttv&gt;Bruno, Anthony. [http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/jessica_lunsford/7.html Jessica Lunsford: Death of a 9 year old"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306091347/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/jessica_lunsford/7.html |date=2007-03-06 }}, CourtTV CrimeLibrary&lt;/ref&gt; He occupied a trailer along with two women, some {{convert|100|yd}} away, at the time of Lunsford's abduction.&lt;ref name=drifter3days&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/06/23/lunsford.report/index.html "Drifter says he held girl three days"], CNN.com, 24 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Couey admitted to [[rape|raping]] Lunsford in his bedroom, keeping her in his bed that evening, where he raped her again in the morning. Couey put her in his closet and ordered her to remain there, which she did as he reported for work at "Billy's Truck Lot".&lt;ref name=courttv /&gt; Three days after he abducted her, Couey tricked Jessica into getting into two garbage bags by saying he was going to "take her home". He instead [[Buried alive|buried her alive]] as he decided he could do nothing else with the girl. He said he "Didn't want people seeing him and Lunsford across the street."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Discovery of Lunsford's body===
On March 19, police found Lunsford's body at the residence on West Snowbird Court in Homosassa, buried in a [[plastic bag]] in a hole approximately 2½' deep and 2' circular, covered with leaves. Lunsford's body was removed from the ground and transported to the coroner's office, where it was recorded to had undergone "moderate" to "severe" decomposition. According to the publicly released [[autopsy]] reports, Lunsford had poked two fingers through the bags before [[suffocating]] to death, and the fingers had [[Skeleton|skeletonized]]. The coroner ruled that death would have happened even in best circumstances within 2–3 minutes from lack of [[oxygen]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

After the discovery of Lunsford's body at the residence, Dixon stated that a week earlier she had given Couey money for a bus ticket, and he had telephoned her to say he had moved to [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Additionally, Dixon and the other residents of the trailer claimed to have never seen Lunsford at the home or noticed anything strange from Couey's room, which had not been used since he was last there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ANSWER BRIEF OF APPELLEE |url = http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/pub_info/summaries/briefs/07/07-1636/Filed_04-27-2009_State_Answer_Brief.pdf|website = www.floridasupremecourt.org|accessdate = 2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2006, a judge ruled that Couey's confession was inadmissible in court because when it was recorded police had not granted Couey's requests for a [[lawyer]], thereby rendering the confession invalid and unreliable under the [[Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Fifth]] and [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendments]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. Over Couey's objection, the trial court ruled that all evidence collected after the confession, including the recovery of Lunsford's body, would be admitted, as would incriminating statements allegedly made by Couey to investigators and a jail guard.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. [http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/30/Citrus/Judge__Couey_confessi.shtml "Judge: Couey confession out"] ''St. Petersburg Times'', June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction==
On March 7, 2007, Couey was found guilty in Florida of all charges in relation to Lunsford's death, including [[first degree murder]], kidnapping, and capital [[sexual battery]]. On March 14, 2007, the jury unanimously recommended the [[death penalty]]. The case was appealed to the [[Florida Supreme Court]].

On August 24, 2007, Couey was sentenced to death, in addition to three consecutive [[life sentences]]. However, on September 30, 2009, before the sentences could be carried out, Couey died of [[natural causes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/09/30/florida.couey.dead/index.html|title=Convicted child killer Couey dies in prison, Florida officials say|publisher=CNN.com| date=September 30, 2009|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Jessica Lunsford Act===
{{Main|Jessica's Law}}
Following her death, her father, Mark Lunsford, pursued new legislation to provide more stringent tracking of released [[sex offender]]s. The [[Jessica Lunsford Act]] was named after her. It requires tighter restrictions on sex offenders (such as wearing electronic tracking devices) and increased prison sentences for some convicted sex offenders.&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Jessica. "The Abductions That Changed America", ''[[Newsweek]]'', 29 January 2007, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; "Jessica's Law" refers to similar reform acts initiated by other states.

===Wrongful death and negligence lawsuit===
On February 19, 2008, almost three years to the day after her kidnapping and murder, Jessica's father was represented by [[Jacksonville, Florida]] lawyers in a pre-trial brief filed against the [[Citrus County Sheriff's Office]] and the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/stories/2008/02/18/daily31.html|title=Local attorney plans suit on behalf of Lunsford family|date=February 21, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-27|first=Mark|last=Szakonyi}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving notice of the pending suit, Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy stated that he believed the case to be "baseless... There is only one person in the world that should be held responsible for Jessica Lunsford's death and that's John Couey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/news-article.aspx?storyid=103005|title=Lunsford Plans to Sue Sheriff's Office|date=February 21, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following complaints and suggestions from Citrus County residents that the pending litigation was being pursued out of greed and that had he been a better father his child may still be alive,&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abcactionnews.com/mostpopular/story.aspx?content_id=50383833-bf05-4016-8f3c-a31ca6b0b040|title=Mark Lunsford to reveal new details of his lawsuit in Jacksonville today|date=February 25, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Lunsford and Jacksonville-based attorneys Eric Block and Mark Gelman held a news conference in Jacksonville, where it was stated that the pending litigation was "not for the money... but for change." Lunsford stated that changes were needed in procedures and policies. It is alleged that Couey had Jessica Lunsford alive in the trailer while Citrus County officials visited the trailer, that police dogs indicated Jessica was being held in the direction of the trailer and were ignored, that Citrus County officials actively pursued Mark Lunsford's father as their prime suspect while evidence pointed elsewhere, and that had Citrus County officials followed up on an outstanding warrant issued by Georgia, that Citrus County officials could have entered Couey's residence and possibly saved the child.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/crime/2008/02/26/bts.lunsford.lawsuit.bay|publisher=CNN|title='Not about the money'|date=February 26, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abcactionnews.com/mediacenter/local.aspx?videoid=7073@wfts.dayport.com&amp;navCatId=3|title=Mark Lunsford's allegations announced and Sheriff Jeff Dawsy's response|date=February 26, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Lunsford's transformation to a child activist after the murder of his daughter Jessica is the subject of the 2011 documentary film, ''Jessie's Dad''.&lt;ref name="Stephanie Garry"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garry|first=Stephanie|title=Lunsford's pain vivid in documentary 'Jessie's Dad'|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/article485905.ece|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|date=3 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805234135/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/article485905.ece|archivedate=5 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abduction of Jessica Lunsford was covered in 2013 on the TV series ''[[Investigation Discovery#Current|FBI: Criminal Pursuit]]'' in the episode "Lurking Menace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2IbKyYZPAM|title=Lurking Menace|first=|last=idfullepisodes|date=2 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Debutante Cotillion and Thanksgiving Ball''' of [[Washington, D.C.]] is an annual dance and [[Formal wear|formal]] [[debutante]] presentation of young women. It is one of the largest debutante balls in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Berg Companion to Fashion |authorlink=Valerie Steele |last=Steele |first=Valerie |page=205 |year=2010  |publisher=[[Berg Publishers|Berg]] |isbn=9781847885630 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as one of the nation's most prestigious social events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/11252008/montnew162804_32534.shtml|title=Fire guts Chevy Chase home of National Debutante Cotillion founder|last=Ujifusa|first=Andrew|date=November 25, 2008|work=Gazette.net|accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held during Thanksgiving week each year and benefits the [[Children's National Medical Center]].

The [[Cotillion ball|Cotillion]] was founded in 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rhoad presented in Washington, D.C. |work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]] |date=February 15, 2009 |page=43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Mary-Stuart Montague Price,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bigger and Better |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 10, 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of Captain Allen Ingram Price, [[U.S. Naval Academy]] Class of 1917.  She and Elizabeth Stuart are co-chairmen of the event; regional chairmen from many states including California, South Carolina, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas recommend young women and their families for participation.

The ball is the subject of the 1989 documentary film 'Coming Out'.  In his review, the ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Vincent Canby]] stated that it has "little to do with the kind of old-fashioned 'coming out' rituals and debutante 'seasons' that once so fascinated the social outsiders Scott Fitzgerald wrote about" and that "the escorts for the ball are ... bussed in from nearby military camps and from West Point with the promise of a free meal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reviews/Film Festival; Swindling in 'Jugglers'; Cotillion in 'Coming Out' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/movies/reviews-film-festival-swindling-in-jugglers-cotillion-in-coming-out.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 19, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Prize of Plastic Arts of Venezuela''' is an annual award given to various artists from that country, specifically the field of drawing, printmaking and drawing pictorial. It is one of the National Culture Awards.

The reward is delivered continuously since 1947. In 1952 awarding paused for about 19 years, resumed in 1971. The granting is made on an annual basis since its first edition until 2001, when it turned biennial. An exception to this rule was 2003, when it waited three years to give the next award, and then return to biennial delivery.

This is a battle that took place sometime in the years 1178-1182 AD between Nalagamaraju, a Haihaya Kshatriya king who ruled the area of Palnadu in Guntur District, and his step brother Malidevaraju. Nalagamaraju was supported by the Reddy lady Nagamma while Malidevaraju was supported by Recherla Brahmanaidu who was a social reformer.

==Vicinity==

Palnadu is the region located in the south-western area of Guntur district and covering some part of Prakasam district. It is spread over the revenue divisions of Narsaraopet and Gurazala in Guntur district and Markapur in Prakasam district.

==History==

When Anuguraju of the Haiahays migrated to the Andhra area from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, he clashed with the Velanati Chodas of Velnadu who ruled from Chandavolu. Velanati Gonkaraju installed Anuguraju as king of Palnadu at Gurajala after giving his daughter Mailama Devi to him in marriage. As Anuguraju is non Telugu speaking and has migrated to Andhra area only at that time, and is unfamiliar with the local people, Gonkaraju appointed Dodda Naidu of Recherla Gotra as his minister to guide him. Anugu Raju had 2 more wives, Viravidya Devi and Bhoorama Devi. Anuguraju was however childless and adopted the eldest son of his minister Dodda Naidu. Soon after this Mailama Devi gave birth to a son called Nalagamaraju. Disillusioned with the turn of events Dodda Naidu stepped down as minister of Anuguraju and made his younger son Brahma Naidu as a minister instead. Nalagamaraju became king after Anuguraju. 

Nalagamaraju had a step brother called Malidevaraju who married a princess from the Kalachuris of Kalyanadurga in Karnataka. 
Brahma Naidu was highly respected in his time and is a warrior, scholar and reformer. Brahmanaidu captured the fort of Shimoga from the Veera Saivaites on the request of the Kalyani Chalukyan King of Kalyani. The king in turn gave his daughter Sirimadevi in marriage to Malidevaraju. Brahma Naidu was a staunch Vaishnavaite and founded a new sect called Veera Vaishnavism as against Veera Saivism which was prevalent then and which allowed the Sudras into its fold but not untouchables. Brahma Naidu allowed equal status to the untouchables. The social reforms like Chapa Koodu (having food sitting side by side on a mat irrespective of caste) initiated by Brahma Naidu have antagonized the conservatives of the Palnadu society. Brahma Naidu did not stop with Chapakoodu and in this he is centuries, nay 800 years ahead of the present day social reformers. He had all castes including the scheduled Castes in his army. In fact Kannamanedu from the Scheduled caste was treated almost like Brahma Naidus own son and was made the commander of his army.  

The conservatives found an able leader in one reddy lady named Nagamma who is known as Nayakuralu. Nagamma joined the court of Nalagamaraju and gained his confidence. Thereafter, she made Nalagamarju displace Brahma Naidus men from key positions. The differences in the court and the royal family grew which led to the division of the Kingdom. 

Nalagamaraju’s half brother Malidevarju moved to Macherla and set up a separate kingdom there. Brahma Naidu moved to Macherla along with Malidevaraju. 

Mutual suspicion between the two kingdoms grew and Nagamma under the pretext of Malidevas defeat in a cockfight exiled them for 7 years from Palnadu. After the exile Brahma Naidu sent Alaraju the brother in law of Malidevaraju to claim Malidevaraju’s share. The demand was turned down and Alaraju was poisoned in Cherlagudipadu by the orders of Nagamma. His wife Perindevi committed Sati with Alaraju. This enraged Malidevaraju and Kommaraju who was the father of Alaraju. Brahma Naidu then declared war on Gurajala. 

The battle was fought at Karempudi on the banks of the river Naguleru. Nalagamaraju was supported by the Kakatiyas, Hoysalas and Paricchedis. Malidevaraju was supported by the Kalachuris of Kalyanadurga.    

Nalagamarajus side was victorious in the battle and Malidevaraju died fighting. Brahma Naidu was forced to reinstate Nalagamarju. Balachandrudu the valiant son of Brahma Naidu died in this battle along with his wife Manchala. A whole generation of Andhra warriors perished in the battle. This battle weakened the Velnati Chodas, and this later helped the Kakatiyas to take over their domain.

'''Prisión Fatal (2017)''' was a [[professional wrestling]] major event, scripted and produced by the [[Mexico]] based [[International Wrestling Revolution Group]] (IWRG) [[professional wrestling promotion]]. The event took on January 1, 2017, at "[[Arena Naucalpan]]" in [[Naucalpan, State of Mexico]], IWRG's main venue. The show was also the '''IWRG 21st Anniversary Show''', marking the creation of IWRG on January 1, 1996. It was the seventh time IWRG held a Prisión Fatal event, all of which featured the [[eponym]]ous Prisión Fatal ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Deadly Prison") [[Steel cage match]] as the main event. In the Prisión Fatal match the last person remaining in the cage is forced to unmasked as per the match stipulation.

For this version of the Prisión Fatal steel cage match IWRG booked [[Golden Magic]], [[Imposible (wrestler)|Imposible]], [[Pirata Morgan Jr.]] and [[Relámpago (wrestler)|Relámpago]], who all risked their [[wrestling mask]]. During the match both Golden Magic and Relámpago escaped the cage, leading to Imposible pinning Pirata Morgan Jr. to win the match. Afterward, Pirata Morgan Jr. unmasked and revealed that his real name was Pedro Ortiz Soto, 35 years old at the time and that he had been a professional wrestler for 15 years. The show featured four additional matches

==Production==
     
===Background===
In the 1960s, wrestler Adolfo "Pirata" Moreno began promoting wrestling shows in his native [[Naucalpan, State of Mexico]], Mexico, bringing in wrestlers from [[Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL) to Naucalpan to work shows with local wrestlers from the Mexican [[independent circuit]].&lt;ref name=SL466&gt;{{cite news|title=Arena Naucalpan|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 466|date=June 11, 2012|page=18|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially he ran sporadic shows, but later on began promoting regular shows at "Arena KO Al Gusto". In the 1970s he served as the local [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA) promoter under the name Promociones Moreno efforts.&lt;ref name=SL466/&gt; In 1977 Moreno bought Arena KO Al Gusto instead of renting it. After buying the old arena it was demolished to make way for a new arena, [[Arena Naucalpan]], an arena designed specifically for wrestling shows, with a maximum capacity of 2,400 spectators. Arena Naucalpan became the permanent home for Promociones Moreno.&lt;ref name=SL466/&gt;

In late 1995 Adolfo Moreno decided to create his own promotion, using a regular core roster supplemented with wrestlers from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL, formerly EMLL), creating the [[International Wrestling Revolution Group]] (IWRG; sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) on January 1, 1996.&lt;ref name=YIR1996&gt;{{cite news|title=1996 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2280|date=January 10, 1997|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that point on Arena Naucalpan became the main venue for IWRG, hosting the majority of their weekly shows and all of their [[List of IWRG shows|major shows]] as well.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YIR1998&gt;{{cite news|title=1998 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2348|date=January 9, 1999|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[IWRG Anniversary Show]] was held on January 1, 1997 with all subsequent shows being held on or right after January 1 each year, all at Arena Naucalpan.&lt;ref name=YIR1997/&gt; Posters for the January 1 show mistakenly lists it as the 20th anniversary show, but also bills it as a [[IWRG Prisión Fatal|Prisión Fatal ]] ("Deadly Prison") show.

Starting as far back as at least 2000, the Mexican [[wrestling promotion]] [[International Wrestling Revolution Group]] (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as ''Grupo Internacional Revolución'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man [[steel cage match]] where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their [[wrestling mask]] or have their hair shaved off under ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or "bet match", rules. From 2012 IWRG has promoted a variation of the steel cage match under the moniker Prisión Fatal  at least once a year since its inception. The Prisión Fatal has the added twist that each competitor is chained by the wrist to the cage with a long steel chain and to escape they fight have to get a key to unlock their chain before they are able to escape. The added chain helps to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the [[IWRG Guerra del Golfo]] ("Gulf War"), [[IWRG Guerra de Sexos]] ("War of the Sexes") or [[IWRG El Castillo del Terror]] ("The Tower of Terror") shows. The Prisión Fatal shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in "Arena Naucalpan", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2017 Prisión Fatal show was the seventh time that IWRG promoted a show under that name and the third time the loser would unmask as a result.&lt;ref name=Fatal2000&gt;{{cite news|title=2000 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2488|date=January 9, 2001|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fatal2012&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/12/03/factor-dejo-su-mascara-en-la-prision-fatal | title=Factor dejó su máscara en la Prisión Fatal | date=December 3, 2012| accessdate=December 3, 2012 | work=MedioTiempo | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MedioPrison2013&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2013/03/18/cae-otro-bucanero-pirata-morgan-rapado | title=Cae otro bucanero, Pirata Morgan rapado | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=March 19, 2013 | author=Redaccion | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MedioPrisonJune2013&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2013/06/24/dr-cerebro-rapo-a-x-fly-en-naucalpan | title=Dr. Cerebro rapó a X-Fly en Naucalpan | date=June 23, 2013 | accessdate=August 4, 2015 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FatalMay2014&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/?p=11853 | title=X-Fly pierde la cabellera en la Prisión Fatal | date=May 26, 2015 | accessdate=July 30, 2015 | work=The Gladiatores | language=Spanish | first=Diego | last=Mejía Eguiluz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FatalAugust2014&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/?p=12292 | title=Alan Extreme pierde la cabellera ante los Neza Boy´s en la Prisión Fatal | first=José | last=Lázaro Rodríguez | date=August 27, 2014 | accessdate=July 30, 2015 | work=The Gladiatores | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
The ''Prisión Fatal'' event featured five [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Madigan, Dan | title= Mondo Lucha a Go Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling | publisher= HarperColins Publisher | year= 2007 | chapter = "Okay... what is Lucha Libre?" | page = 31 | quote=featuring clearly distinguished good guys and bad guys, or técnicos and rudos | isbn=978-0-06-085583-3|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
For the main event of the show, [[Golden Magic]], [[Imposible (wrestler)|Imposible]], [[Pirata Morgan Jr.]] and [[Relámpago (wrestler)|Relámpago]] all had individual chains tied to their wrist, secured with a padlock. The chains were long enough to allow the wrestlers to move around the cage, but not long enough to allow them to escape. The first three wrestlers who managed to climb up a ladder and get a key could unlock their change and climb out. During the first portions of the match Relámpago and Impossible focused on each other, while Pirata Morgan Jr. and Golden Magic fought each other, pairing up based on the storyline feuds that had led up to the cage match. Golden Magic was the first wrestler to escape the cage, followed by Relámpago. In the closing moments of the match, it looked like Pirata Morgan Jr. would escape the match, but as he climbed the cage Golden Magic returned to the arena and his rival over the head with a steel chair. Moments later Relámpago tried to prevent Imposible to escape, but Golden Magic prevented it, allowing Imposible to climb out of the cage.&lt;ref name=PrisionFatal2017/&gt;

After the match was finished Pirata Morgan Jr. stood in the middle of the ring, removing his torn, blood-soaked mask and announced that his real name was Pedro Ortiz Soto, legitimately the son of [[Pirata Morgan]] (Pedro Ortiz Villanueva). Then stated that he was 35 years old and had been a luchador for 15 years.&lt;ref name=PrisionFatal2017/&gt;

The '''record years''' ({{lang-sv|Rekordåren}}) describes the [[economy of Sweden]] during the international [[post–World War II economic expansion]], until the [[1973 oil crisis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/krisen-som-skakade-varldens-basta-land/|title=Krisen som skakade världens bästa land|newspaper=[[Sydsvenskan]]|language=Swedish|first=Daniel |last=Rydén|date=8 September 2013|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and largely coinciding with the mandates of prime ministers [[Tage Erlander]] and earliest years of [[Olof Palme]]. The original use was a [[satirical]] left-wing description of the years 1968-70.

Sweden had maintained neutrality during both world wars, and entered the post-war boom with industrial and demographic advantages. Sweden also received aid from the [[Marshall Plan]]. Between 1947 and 1974, the Swedish economy grew at an average rate of 12.5% annually. The urban population, living in towns of over 15,000 people, grew from 38% of the total population in 1931 to 74% by 1973. Sustained by an export boom of automobiles, heavy machinery, electronics, ship-building, and heavy weapons, the per capita income increased by as much as 2000%. Sweden had successfully moved into the high-income group of countries by 1955-56.

==Production==
===Background===
Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', or [[professional wrestling]], [[wrestling promotion|company]] [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide]] (AAA, or Triple A) has held a [[Rey de Reyes]] (Spanish for "King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February,&lt;ref name="Rey1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/mexico/aaa/rey.html#1997 | title = Asistencia Asesoria y Administracion Rey de Reyes | accessdate = February 19, 2009 | date=February 21, 1997 | publisher= ProWrestlingHistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the [[eponym]]ious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's ''Rey''.&lt;ref name=YIR1997&gt;{{cite news|title=1997 Especial!|work=Box y Lucha Magazine|pages=2–28|id=issue 2332|date=January 7, 1998|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Número Especial - Lo mejor de la lucha libre mexicana durante el 2004|work=SuperLuchas|id=Issue 91|date=January 24, 2005|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Four-man elimination match]] with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules.&lt;ref name="Rey1997"/&gt; There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner.&lt;ref name=Lucha2004/&gt; The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the [[AAA Mega Championship]]. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual ''[[AAA Reina de Reinas Championship|Reina de Reinas]]'' ("Queen of Queens") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.&lt;ref name=Reinas1999&gt;{{Cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications |chapter= Mexico: AAA Reina de Reinas | page= 400 | year= 2000 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas12&gt;{{cite news | author = SuperLuchas staff | title = Lo Mejor de la Lucha Libre Mexicana 2008 | work =SuperLuchas | id = issue 296 | date =  January 6, 2008 | url=http://superluchas.net/?p=11145 | accessdate =  July 11, 2009| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reinas13&gt;{{cite web | url= http://superluchas.net/2009/09/26/aaa-heroes-inmortales-homenaje-a-antonio-pena-resultados-en-vivo-26-septiembre-2009-%C2%BFque-pasara-con-la-lucha-entre-charly-manson-y-chessman-%C2%BFquien-sera-el-luchador-sorpresa/ | title= AAA- Héroes Inmortales III- (Resultados en vivo 26 septiembre 2009) – Cibernético gana el Trofeo Antonio Peña – Electroshock sustituye a Charly Manson contra Chessman – El luchador sorpresa fue Konan Big | author= Marquina, Alva | date= September 26, 2009 | accessdate= September 27, 2009 | publisher= ''SuperLuchas'' Magazine| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 show was the 18th Rey de Reyes show in the series.

===Storylines===
The Rey de Reyes show featured seven [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

'''Roger Sutton''' (born {{Birth based on age as of date|df=yes|47|2012|6|12}}) is a business leader in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. He was chief executive of power lines company [[Orion New Zealand Limited]] from 2003 until 13 June 2011, when he commenced as CEO of the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]]. He resigned in 2014 after being found guilty of serious misconduct by the State Services Commission.

==Professional career==
Sutton grew up in [[Wellington]], [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="SST bio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dudding|first=Adam|title=Power struggles|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/4784924/Power-struggles|accessdate=16 May 2011|newspaper=Sunday Star Times|date=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1986 from the [[University of Canterbury]] with a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (Mechanical).&lt;ref name="quake recovery czar (Stuff)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Roger Sutton appointed quake recovery czar|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4995119/Roger-Sutton-appointed-quake-recovery-czar|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=Stuff|date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy sector ===
Mr Sutton commenced his career with the [[Electricity Corporation of New Zealand]] (ECNZ) as a mechanical engineer at [[New Plymouth Power Station]] in 1987. From 1988 to 1989, he worked for ECNZ as a business analyst.&lt;ref name="quake recovery czar (Stuff)" /&gt; From 1996 to 1998, he was general manager trading at Southpower, the electricity generation and distribution arm of [[Christchurch City Council]].&lt;ref name="quake recovery czar (Stuff)" /&gt;

As a consequence of [[Max Bradford]]'s reform of the electricity sector, Southpower had to be split, and Sutton remained with the energy distribution part of one of its successors, Orion New Zealand Ltd, majority-owned by [[Christchurch City Holdings]]. From 1998 to 2002, he was general manager commercial at Orion.&lt;ref name="quake recovery czar (Stuff)" /&gt; In December 2002, he was appointed general manager operations.&lt;ref name="Orion CEO press release"&gt;{{cite news|title=Roger Sutton appointed CEO of Orion|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0304/S00218/roger-sutton-appointed-ceo-of-orion.htm|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=Scoop}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early March 2003, he became acting CEO of Orion, and took the position of CEO on 1 May 2003,&lt;ref name="Orion CEO press release" /&gt; being responsible for 500 staff.&lt;ref name="Outstanding leader"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heather|first=Ben|title='Outstanding leader' for rebuild|newspaper=The Press|date=13 May 2011|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, his salary was $700k.&lt;ref name="Outstanding leader" /&gt; {{As of|May 2011}}, he is chairman of Connetics, a fully owned Orion subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Governance|url=http://www.connetics.co.nz/SubPages/Governance.aspx|publisher=Connetics|accessdate=12 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324005803/http://www.connetics.co.nz/SubPages/Governance.aspx|archivedate=24 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is chair of the [[Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority]].&lt;ref name="Outstanding leader" /&gt;

In the late 1990s, Sutton was a member of the New Zealand Energy Market rules committee and the market rules structure groups.&lt;ref name="Orion CEO press release" /&gt; During 2001, Sutton was seconded to the office of the Minister of Energy, [[Pete Hodgson]], during the country's electricity crisis.&lt;ref name="Orion CEO press release" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hon Pete Hodgson|url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/MPs/2/c/3/49MP1141-Hodgson-Pete.htm |publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority===
On 12 May 2011, Earthquake Recovery Minister [[Gerry Brownlee]] announced Sutton as the first permanent CEO of the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] (CERA).&lt;ref name="Press conference (Press)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heather|first=Ben| title=Roger Sutton to be new quake tsar|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/4995021/Roger-Sutton-chief |accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=The Press|date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment is for a five-year period. Sutton replaced the interim CEO John Ombler.&lt;ref name="Press conference (Press)" /&gt; On 13 June 2011, Sutton commenced the new role, which has a remuneration of $500k.&lt;ref name="quake recovery czar (Stuff)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Outstanding leader" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Press conference (Press)" /&gt; The new role, where he has a staff of about 50, pays $200k less than his previous role at Orion.&lt;ref name="Outstanding leader" /&gt;

Sutton's appointment was widely praised and welcome from all sectors of society, with the popularity gained by Sutton's reaction to the way power was restored, staff praised and information communicated&lt;ref name="Moore Anderton suggestion" /&gt; after the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. Christchurch mayor [[Bob Parker (mayor)|Bob Parker]] said that Sutton "would be very popular".&lt;ref name="Press conference (Press)" /&gt; The CEO of the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce, Peter Townsend, said it was the "most important Government appointment of the year" and that Sutton had all the right attributes for the job.&lt;ref name="Press conference (Press)" /&gt; The Central City Business Association manager Paul Lonsdale said that Sutton had shown through his reaction to three earthquakes (this counts the Boxing Day aftershock as a separate event) that he is very pragmatic.&lt;ref name="Press conference (Press)" /&gt;

The chairman of the Canterbury Communities' Earthquake Recovery Network (CanCERN), Tom McBrearty, said that Sutton "brings two key ingredients – leadership around business and emphatic values around the community."&lt;ref name="Press conference (Press)" /&gt; [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] MP [[Ruth Dyson]], whose [[Port Hills (New Zealand electorate)|Port Hills electorate]] covers the area in east Christchurch worst affected by the last earthquake, said that Sutton was the perfect choice and gave him "12 out of 10".&lt;ref name="Press conference (Press)" /&gt;

Sutton was first suggested to lead the city's rebuild by former mayor [[Garry Moore (mayor)|Garry Moore]] and [[Wigram (New Zealand electorate)|Wigram]] MP [[Jim Anderton]] in early March 2011.&lt;ref name="Moore Anderton suggestion"&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway|first=Glenn|title=Power boss 'should lead city rebuild'|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/canterbury-earthquake-2010/4719997/Power-boss-should-lead-city-rebuild|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=The Press|date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he was an award winner at the Energy Excellence Awards for outstanding contribution to the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.energyawards.co.nz/news/winners-announced-0| title=Deloitte Energy Excellence Award Winners Announced| first=Matt| last=Freeman| date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resignation ===
Sutton resigned as CEO of CERA on 17 November 2014, after a complaint from a female staffer about inappropriate behaviour. An investigation by the States Services Commission found Sutton guilty of 'serious misconduct' but did not recommend that he should be dismissed.  State Services Commissioner [[Iain Rennie]] subsequently came under fire for his handling of the investigation. He allowed Sutton to give his version of events at a press conference announcing his resignation - even though Sutton and the complainant were both bound by a confidentiality agreement. Several high-level Government officials also attended the press conference giving the impression that the Government supported Sutton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11363341 Pressure goes on State Services Commissioner Iain Rennie], New Zealand Herald, 24 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner, Dr Jackie Blue, wrote to Mr Rennie about his handling of the allegations against Mr Sutton including the breach of confidentiality saying: "I am concerned about the chilling effect the current situation will have on anyone else in the public sector who is being sexually harassed and wants to make a complaint about that harassment."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrc.co.nz/news/concern-over-handling-sutton-complaint/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Sutton is married to the former journalist Jo Malcolm. They have three sons.&lt;ref name="Outstanding leader" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TV3 news (appoinment)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hampton |first=Jeff |title=Unconventional lines man appointed new quake boss|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Unconventional-lines-man-appointed-new-quake-boss/tabid/423/articleID/210898/Default.aspx|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=TV3 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Robyn Malcolm]] is his sister in law.&lt;ref name="TV3 news (appoinment)" /&gt;

'''Saeftinghe''' or '''Saaftinge''' was a town in the southwest [[Netherlands]], located in eastern [[Zeelandic Flanders]], near [[Nieuw-Namen]]. It existed until 1584. It is now a swamp known as the Drowned Land of Saeftinghe (''[[:nl:Verdronken Land van Saeftinghe|Verdronken land van Saeftinghe]]'') and an official nature reserve area. The land is a crosspoint where the river [[Scheldt]] meets the salty waters of the [[North Sea]] in the [[estuary]] [[Western Scheldt]]. It is a treacherous place where the tides easily consume large stretches of land in a matter of seconds and must not be explored without an experienced guide.

==History==
Saeftinghe was drained in the 13th century under the management of the [[Ter Doest Abbey|abbey of Ter Doest]]. [[Willem van Saeftinghe]] was one of the best known occupants of the abbey and gave his name to the stretch of land claimed from the sea. Up to 1570, the land was very fertile [[polder]]. Agriculture, peat burning and trade turned Saeftinghe into one of the most prosperous places in the region. There were three additional settlements nearby: Namen, Sint-Laureins, and Casuwele.

Most of the land around the town was lost in the [[All Saints' Flood (1570)|All Saint's flood]] of 1570 (the ''Allerheiligenvloed''). Four years later the drowned land reached into what is now [[Belgium]]. Only Saeftinghe and some surrounding land managed to remain dry.

In 1584, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], Dutch soldiers found themselves forced to destroy the last intact dike and Saeftinghe sunk into the waters of the [[Scheldt]]. Attempts to reclaim the area were made throughout history; the most serious project taking place in 1907, but even then only the {{Interlanguage link multi|Hertogin Hedwigepolder|nl}} was conquered from the sea. Nowadays a hamlet is located within the reclaimed portions of land, called {{Interlanguage link multi|Emmadorp|nl}}.
Saaftinge itself has never been retrieved.
In 1970, all of the area was incorporated into the municipality of [[Hulst]], when [[Graauw en Langendam]] and [[Clinge]] ceased to exist.

Within the historical municipal limits, Saaftinge today has a population of 55. The flag consists of a blue lion rampant on a white field. The lion originates from the personal shield of Willem van Saeftinghe.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Schouten, "Historische Gemeenten van Nederland en hun Vlaggen", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legend==
{{main|Saeftinghe legend}}
A legend of Saeftinghe attributes the [[All Saints' Flood (1570)|All Saint's flood]] to capturing a mermaid and not setting her free. This caused the region to be cursed by the merman, and led to the flood that destroyed the towns of Sint-Laureins, Namen and Casuwele, killing all inhabitants. The legend holds that a tower bell calls for help from the sunken town.

==Visitor centre==
A visitor centre opened in Emmadorp in 1997, from where excursions to the nature reserve depart. From 1997 to 2007, an average of around 12,000 visitors per year went on excursions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7821">Competitions in [[Ballroom dancing]] in the former [[Soviet Union]] were held in three dance categories:

[[Glossary of partner dance terms#Standard|''Standard dances'']], [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Latin|''Latin dances'']], and '''Soviet dances''' ("Советская программа").

== Soviet category ==

The Soviet category comprised
:- [[Polka]] - [[Rylio]] - [[Varu-Varu]] - [[Sudarushka]] - [[Russian Lyrical]] ({{lang-ru|Полька, Рилио (Рилё), Вару-Вару, Сударушка, Русский лирический}})

With the exception of Polka, these dances were choreographed basing on some [[folk dance]]s of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s.
: - Rylio is of [[Lithuania]]n origin, created by Skaistė Idzelevičienė, the leader of the Lithuanian ballroom [[formation team]] [[Žuvėdra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancesport.lt/zuvedra/en/zuv01.htm About Žuvėdra]&lt;/ref&gt;
: - Varu-Varu (translated as "I can, I can") is of [[Latvia]]n origin.
: - Sudarushka (loosely translated as "sweetheart") and Russian Lyrical are [[Russia]]n.

The former three are "fast" or "rhythmic" dances, the latter two are "slow" or "lyrical" ones.

All of them had distinctive basic techniques. The meter was {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}} for all of them. The hold was either open or loose, without body contact. Polka had the tightest hold. Polka, Sudarushka and Russian Lyrical were [[progressive dance]]s, i.e., moving along the [[line of dance]]. Rylio and Varu-Varu were of "stationary" type.

Soviet ballroom dances were a relatively new creation. This dance category was introduced with the stated agenda to counterbalance the influence of Western culture (i.e., Ballroom dancing, [[rock music]], [[the Beatles]], etc.). During the relatively short existence of Soviet Ballroom, only the first three had a chance of becoming true Ballroom/Social dances, judging by the flexibility and spontaneity of choreography, willingness of dancers to dance them during practice hours, etc. Rylio had all chances to repeat the evolution of Swing dances: it was danced quite differently in Baltic republics (smoothly), in Belarus (jumpy), and in Moscow. On the contrary, a heat of Sudarushka during a ballroom competition often looked like a performance of a [[formation team]], all competitors dancing almost the same routine. 

At the peak of popularity some huge ball rooms of [[Moscow]] [[Palace of Culture|Palaces of Culture]] crowded parties of several hundred of ballroom couples in 4-5 concentric circles of Sudarushka.

Today the category is obsolete, but the dances themselves survived, moved back to the category of [[folk dance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esta.nm.ru/Tema.html Dance lessons] of the dance club Esta-MEPHI (ЭСТА-МИФИ) of [[Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute]] (МИФИ) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some dance events, such as "Neva Cup" (Невский кубок) in [[St. Petersburg]], balls of Esta-Mephi club, [[Moscow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancemaze.ru/main.php?action=arts&amp;what=show&amp;id=31 New Year Ball in MEPHI, 2002/2003] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Russian Formation Cup-2007" held in [[Tyumen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftsr.ru/plan/info/2007_03_27_28_1.doc "Russian Formation Cup-2007"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227130037/http://www.ftsr.ru/plan/info/2007_03_27_28_1.doc |date=2008-02-27 }}, sponsored by the administration of [[Tyumen Oblast]], Russia {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; these dances comprise the competition category of "Homeland Dances" (Отечественные танцы).

===Some basic step-rhythm patterns===

The count cues could be any of 12345678, 12341234, 1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp; or 1&amp;2&amp;1&amp;2&amp;.

All steps/taps are in place, with slight one-foot skipping action. Author - choreographer - Adomas Gineitis

====Varu-Varu====

The dance is based on simple steps and jumpy movements created in 1950s in Latvia. It may be danced with any in 4/4 time [[disco]] music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esta.nm.ru/dance/varuvaru.html Varu-Varu], choreography {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sudarushka====
The dance is based on Russian ''[[khorovod]]'' dances. the dance is of vivid and light character, of medium to faster tempo in 2/4 time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esta.nm.ru/dance/sudarushka.html Sudarushka], choreography {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Most walks are based on "Russian triple step": step-step-step-hold. It can be performed forward, backward, with turn on any step.

The recommended tunes are "Русский лирический" (''Russian Lyrical'') or "Подмосковные вечера" (''[[Moscow Nights]]'')

==Other Soviet ballroom==
Ballroom dance manuals of Soviet times list quite a few other Soviet dances promoted to counter the influence of the "Western way of life", created basing on folk dances of the peoples of the Soviet Union and [[Soviet Bloc]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusnauka.com/NTSB_2006/MusicaAndLife/2_kas_janov%20o.je..doc.htm "Classification of modern ballroom dances"], an article of the [[Kiev National University of Culture and Arts]] {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19812">The '''Soviet grain procurement crisis of 1928''', sometimes referred to as "the crisis of [[New Economic Policy|NEP]]," was a pivotal economic event which took place in the [[Soviet Union]] beginning in January 1928 during which the quantities of [[wheat]], [[rye]], and other cereal crops made available for purchase by the state fell to levels regarded by planners as inadequate to support the needs of the country's urban population. Failure of the state to make successful use of the [[supply and demand|price system]] to generate sufficient grain sales was met with a regimen of increasingly harsh administrative sanctions against the Soviet [[peasantry]]. The state of national emergency which followed led to the termination of the [[New Economic Policy]] and spurred a move towards the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization of agriculture]] in 1929.

==History==

===Background===

The [[Russian Revolution]] of November 1917 ushered in a period of [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and economic dislocation, in which the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]] (VKP) made use of forced grain requisitions (&lt;small&gt;Russian:&lt;/small&gt; ''[[prodrazvyorstka]]),'' trading to the [[peasant]]ry a mix of virtually worthless paper currency and an altogether insufficient quantity of consumer goods in exchange for each household's marketable surplus — effectively a seizure.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Nove, ''An Economic History of the USSR.'' London: Allen Lane/Penguin Press, 1969; pg. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed by most Soviet contemporaries as a temporary wartime expedient, this system of "[[War Communism]]" was extremely unpopular with Russia's grain-producing peasantry and the cause of a massive wave of unrest and revolts that threatened to fatally destabilize the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nove, ''An Economic History of the USSR,'' pg. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

This force-based system of War Communism was abandoned in the spring of 1921 with the adoption of the so-called "[[New Economic Policy]]" (NEP), under which a stable, gold-based currency was restored and a return made to the market system. Instead of forced requisitions of all marketable surpluses, a food tax (&lt;small&gt;Russian:&lt;/small&gt; ''[[prodnalog]])'' was implemented which necessitated peasant households providing a limited portion of their production to the state, after which households would be free to sell its remaining surplus not needed for household survival on the open market.&lt;ref&gt;Nove, ''An Economic History of the USSR,'' pp. 83-84.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1924 this system of ''prodnalog'' had been replaced by a money tax, with Soviet state grain requisitions accomplished via buying and selling.&lt;ref&gt;Nove, ''An Economic History of the USSR,'' pg. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the return to the market system in agriculture was ideologically problematic for many Bolsheviks, the years from 1922 to 1926 were successful in practical terms, with total agricultural production by the peasant-based economy fully returning to pre-revolutionary levels.&lt;ref name=Davies1-4&gt;R.W. Davies, ''The Industrialisation of Soviet Russia: Volume 1: The Socialist Offensive: The Collectivisation of Soviet Agriculture, 1929-1930.'' London: Macmillan, 1980; pg. 4. Henceforth ''The Collecitivisation of Soviet Agriculture.''&lt;/ref&gt; Production of cereal grains approximated pre-war figures, potato production greatly exceeded such figures, and [[livestock]] populations, gravely impacted during the war, returned to normalcy for pigs and sheep while the count of horses was slowly and steadily restored.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''The Collecitivisation of Soviet Agriculture,'' pg. 4. Note especially Table 1 (pg. 419) and Table 2 (pg. 420).&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of War Communism saw Soviet cities largely depopulated when former peasants returned ''en masse'' to their native villages amidst the ongoing economic collapse. This trend was reversed under NEP and industrial facilities were restored and restarted, approaching the pre-war levels of output during the second half of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Naum Jasny, ''Soviet Industrialization, 1928-1952.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961; pg. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Further growth of the economy and improvement of living conditions, it was felt by Soviet planners, would require new investment in factory facilities and capital goods. With access to world capital markets severely restricted to the revolutionary Soviet regime, these funds that would need to be generated by the state either through a loosening of the backing of the gold-based currency, a raising in the level of taxation of the largely rural population, or some combination of these factors.

Communist Party penetration of the countryside remained weak, amounting to an average of 1 rural Communist for every 6 village [[soviet (council)|soviets]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Thorniley, ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Rural Communist Party, 1927-39.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1988; pg. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; — a mere 0.52% of the rural population vs. 1.78% of the total population in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: Foundations of a Planned Economy, 1926-1929: Volume 2.'' London: Macmillan, 1971; pb. 179. Henceforth "Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2."&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these rural Communists, who took leading roles in village soviets and cooperatives, included a disproportionate number of comparatively well-to-do peasants — a social group, party and non-party, which dominated local administration.&lt;ref&gt;Thorniley, ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Rural Communist Party, 1927-39,'' pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This persistent strength of so-called "[[kulak]]s" in the Soviet countryside further contributed to the dissatisfaction with the economic status quo on the part of many members of the largely urban Communist Party.

From the end of 1926 demand among planners and party activists for a [[Industrialization in the Soviet Union|new program of mass industrialization]] that would modernize the largely peasant country.&lt;ref&gt;Thorniley, ''The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Rural Communist Party, 1927-39,'' pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Although NEP was seen at the time as a permanent structure throughout 1927, the [[15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|15th Congress of the VKP(b)]], held in [[Moscow]] in December 1927, acceded to this sentiment, approving a new program for the industrialization of the USSR — an acceleration which would ultimately prove incompatible with a small peasantry freely exchanging a comparatively small fraction of its production in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Jasny, ''Soviet Industrialization, 1928-1952,'' pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collectivization of agriculture]] was held by the Communists to be the essential corollary of any successful industrial campaign, it being faithfully maintained that collective organization would eliminate the inefficiencies inherent in capitalist agriculture, thereby expanding production and making a greater quantity of grain available to the state for conversion to capital goods.

===Goods shortage===

Throughout the early years of the Russian revolution the peasantry faced a shortage of basic farm and household items, including agricultural implements, construction material, cloth, and finished consumer goods.&lt;ref name=Hughes109&gt;James Hughes, ''Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1991; pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a continuation of the wartime situation, in which industrial production had been moved from a consumer orientation to fulfillment of the military needs of the state in the war against the [[German empire]].&lt;ref name=Hughes109 /&gt; The Bolshevik regime had never been able to catch up with pent up demand, and state and cooperative supplies remained spotty, while the prices demanded by private traders remained high.&lt;ref name=Hughes109 /&gt;

A so-called [[Scissors Crisis]] had developed in the early years of the New Economic Policy as prices of consumer goods escalated while market prices of agricultural products fell.&lt;ref name=Hughes109 /&gt; Early in 1927 the Communist Party decided to address the disparity by lowering the selling prices of industrial goods by approximately 10%.&lt;ref name=Hughes109 /&gt; Although this pricing decision was meant to undercut the high prices charged by private traders, in practice it only exacerbated the miserable supply situation as goods were snapped up from the market, leaving the inventories of state supply agents barren.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, ''Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP,'' pp. 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt; Those goods which were available tended to be committed to larger towns, located along railway lines, rather than to smaller villages deep in the countryside.&lt;ref name=Hughes109 /&gt;

The net result of this situation was a goods famine that provided an inadequate incentive for peasants to participate in grain sales to state grain purchasing agents, who had little of practical value to offer the peasantry in exchange.&lt;ref name=Hughes109 /&gt;

===Emergence of the crisis===
[[File:Stalin-Bukharin.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet leaders Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin in 1928. The pair would split over the agricultural question in that year.]]

The Soviet economic year (October 1 to September 30) 1925/26 had generated state grain procurement of 8.4 million tons.&lt;ref name=Hughes102&gt;James Hughes, ''Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP,'' pg. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; This was far exceeded in 1926/27, when a post-revolutionary record harvest of 76.8 million tons resulted in a state procurement of 10.6 million tons at stable prices.&lt;ref name=Hughes102 /&gt; No upward price adjustment had been necessary owing to the massive size of the harvest, which resulted in a supply [[Overproduction|glut]].&lt;ref name=Hughes103&gt;Hughes, ''Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP,'' pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Expectations for the coming year were raised accordingly, with planned procurement for the coming economic year 1927/28 exceeding quantities obtained during the previous year of record harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, ''Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP,'' pp. 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to planned establishment of a new state grain reserve of 819,000 tons, economic planners sought increased quantities of grain for export to the European market as a means of generating the foreign currency needed for purchase of capital goods from abroad.&lt;ref name=Hughes104&gt;Hughes, ''Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP,'' pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls for an official policy of centrally-planned industrialization had emanated from the Left Opposition headed by [[Leon Trotsky]] throughout the middle 1920s, with an explicit criticism levied in a September 1927 program of a "frank and open drift to the Right," to accommodation with the most wealthy segment of the peasantry to the detriment of national industrialization and further development of a socialist economy.&lt;ref name=Carr2-56&gt;Carr, ''Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2,'' pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  This demand was easy to ignore when grain was readily available to the state on the market and unused factory capacity remained to be restarted. However, late in 1927 the pervasive optimism associated with the boom period of NEP began to dissipate.&lt;ref name=Carr2-56 /&gt;

A severe slump in state grain collections began in October 1927, following the new harvest of wheat and rye.&lt;ref name=Hughes104 /&gt; This trend continued in November and December, with planned total procurements for the quarter of 7 million tons missed by a massive 2.1 million tons.&lt;ref name=Hughes104 /&gt; This quantity was not only insufficient for creation of the planned grain reserve and the meeting of export targets, but was viewed by planners as insufficient for the feeding of the nation's cities and the members of the [[Red Army]].&lt;ref name=Hughes104 /&gt;
Reasons for the decline set off a fierce debate in the ranks of the VKP(b).&lt;ref name=Hughes104 /&gt; Party leader [[Joseph Stalin]] depicted the shortfall as political in nature, the result of "sabotage" by the rich peasantry in an effort to force the state to raise grain procurement prices.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, ''Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP,'' pp. 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt; This Stalin likened to blackmail — forcing the state to abandon its industrialization plans in favor of filling their own pockets with the proceeds of sales to the market.&lt;ref name=Hughes105&gt;Hughes, ''Stalin, Siberia and the Crisis of the NEP,'' pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's joint leader of the party during previous years, [[Nikolai Bukharin]], regarded this perspective as a "fairy tale," instead arguing that rather than hoarding and speculation the cause of grain supply difficulties was a poor harvest, combined with insufficiently attractive procurement prices that deterred sales to state grain collectors.&lt;ref name=Hughes105 /&gt;

The crisis in grain collections caused a split of the top leadership of the Communist Party, with a majority of party activists rallying around Stalin, who had now begun vigorously espousing the virtues of rapid industrialization previously associated with [[Trotsky]] and the [[Left Opposition]].&lt;ref name=Carr2-57&gt;Carr, ''Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2,'' pg. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Only a minority supported Bukharin and his call for continued social peace between the state and the peasantry and his criticism of those who would "neglect a sense of moderation, to skip over necessary stages" on the slow and  measured path to industrial development.&lt;ref name=Carr2-57 /&gt;

Stalin and the rapid industrializers retained effective control over the VKP(b), controlling 6 of 9 seats of the party's [[Politburo|Political Bureau]], which handled matters of day-to-day governance, with [[Bukharin]] able to muster the support of [[Alexei Rykov]] and [[Mikhail Tomsky]] in favor of a moderate pace of industrialization and social peace.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, 'Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2,'' pp. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the scenes Stalin organized diligently, obliquely criticizing moderates in speeches to groups of party activists and with his new right-hand man, [[Viacheslav Molotov]] maintaining effective control of the official party daily newspaper, ''[[Pravda]],'' and efforts being made to take over editorial control of the party's monthly [[theoretician (Marxism)|theoretical]] magazine, ''[[Bolshevik (journal)|Bolshevik]].''&lt;ref&gt;Carr, 'Foundations of a Planned Economy, Vol. 2,'' pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Nicholas Pisanos''' (born '''Spiros Pisanos''' ({{lang-el|Σπύρος Πίσανος}}); November 10, 1919 – June 6, 2016) was a Greek-American aviator and [[flying ace]] who served as a fighter pilot with the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and later the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in World War II. He was credited with shooting down 10 enemy aircraft while flying with the American [[4th Fighter Group]]. Post-war, he achieved the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the [[United States Air Force]], flew in the [[Vietnam War]] and, by the end of his career in 1974, had received 33 decorations and distinctions. His autobiography, ''The Flying Greek'', was published in April 2008.

==Early life==
Pisanos was born in [[Metaxourgeio]], [[Athens]], Greece.&lt;ref name=GOE&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/2006/pisanos_2006.asp |title = Pisanos' Biography |year = 2006 |accessdate =August 13, 2009 |work = Gathering of Eagles |publisher=United States Air Force Air University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The son of a [[railroad engineer]], he was fascinated as a young boy by the sight of a Greek biplane maneuvering over his head in Kolonos and became obsessed by the wish to become a flyer.&lt;ref name=GOE/&gt;  For the time being, he had to settle for frequent trips to a military aerodrome in the north of Athens, Dekelia (Tatoi), to watch the planes up close. Eventually, he became known to the personnel there who allowed him to wander in the hangars and sit in the planes. When he left school he searched for a chance to go to the United States where he knew he could take private flying lessons. In 1938 he was employed as a navy merchant seaman but at first chance he fled his ship to the docks of Baltimore and then to New York where he started working as a clandestine immigrant in US.{{sfnp|Himchak|2009}}

==Royal Air Force career==
Starting with only a few dollars in his pocket he worked in a bakery, then as a tray boy in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] and spent most of his income for English and flying lessons, finally earning a private pilot's license in 1939.  His popularity at work and at home enabled him to convert from an illegal alien to a lawful immigrant worker in the United States. For convenience people started calling him ‘Steve’ a short name that was later to replace his original Greek name.

After the war broke out and Greece was attacked in 1940, he tried to join the [[United States Army Air Forces]] but he was denied due to US neutrality. However, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was informally recruiting aviators in English-speaking countries; Britain, being an ally of Greece, accepted him.&lt;ref name=GOE/&gt; Candidates were evaluated in an airfield in California, where Pisanos was chosen as a [[pilot officer]] candidate for the RAF. After initial training in Canada and England, Pisanos joined the American-manned No. 71 [[Eagle Squadron]] while still a Greek citizen.{{sfnp|Himchak|2009}} He mainly flew the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire Vb]] on low-level strafing attack missions over occupied Europe. He was again a very popular person and pilot within his group.

==United States Army Air Forces==
Pisanos' lack of American citizenship prevented him from joining a purely American combat unit (i.e. one commanded by American officers). At the same time, the Greek government-in-exile was recruiting him for one of its new squadrons created in North Africa. Pisanos' comrades decided the solution was to convince the United States government to grant him citizenship under the name of 'Steve Pisanos', which it did on May 3, 1942, with the help of his commander, Squadron Leader [[Chesley G. Peterson]]. Pisanos became the first American citizen naturalized while on foreign soil.{{sfnp|Himchak|2009}}

When the United States entered World War II and started establishing air bases in England, the pilots in the three ‘Eagle Squadrons' were the only combat-experienced American pilots in Europe. A decision was made to integrate them into the US Army Air Forces. However, the pilots had developed strong links between them and preferred to stay in the same units with their present composition as pilots of the newly established [[4th Fighter Group]]. Thus, Pisanos' unit, No. 71 Squadron RAF, became the 334th Fighter Squadron in September 1942.

In March 1943, the 4th Fighter Group started flying the new [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighter. As a member of the 334th Fighter Squadron, Pisanos' plane (P-47D-23-AAF Serial Number 42-27945) was coded QP-D and had an emblem of ‘Miss Plainfield’ painted on it as nose art&lt;ref name=GOE/&gt; He scored his first 2 confirmed victories over northeastern Belgium escorting US bombers while he had another 2 non-confirmed ones around the same time. He was soon promoted to the rank of Flight Lieutenant. He participated in more sorties in a variety of fighter tasks mainly over northwestern France, achieving another 4 confirmed kills against Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighters. Back in New Jersey people who knew him and heard the news of his successes prompted the local press to write an article. The title of the first one was 'The Flying Greek'. This title influenced him, and some 60 years later he named his book after it.

At the end of 1943, Pisanos had 6 confirmed and 2 probable air victories. In January 1944, the 4th Fighter Group received the new [[P-51 Mustang|P-51]] Mustang fighter. Pisanos' new plane (P-51B-7-NA, AAF Serial Number 43-6798) was also coded QP-B. On a mission over southern France on May 5, 1944, when the squadron escorted [[B-17]] bombers to Bordeaux, he scored another 2 confirmed victories. On his return his engine began running rough, and he had to belly-land between Le Havre and Évreux in France.&lt;ref name=GOE/&gt; Although initially blamed on a spark plug malfunction, it is more likely due to use of 150-octane fuel. Once the USAAF switched to 100-octane fuel, problems with spark plug burn-out ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SHAEF|title=150/100 Octane Initial Testing and Proposals|url=http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/150grade/150-grade-fuel.html|publisher=USAAF Material Command|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this very mission, on the same day, [[Charles Yeager|Charles ‘Chuck’ Yeager]] was downed as well, near the Pyrenees, and was able to escape to Spain.

==In the French Resistance==
Pisanos was helped by the [[French Resistance]] to hide from the Germans and was then given a false identity to pass as a distant family member to escape via Spain. Instead, he stayed in the French Resistance and was later moved to Paris.{{sfnp|Himchak|2009}} From there he established contact with agents of the OSS, collecting information about German traffic movement in the area, and participated in a number of local fights alongside the French until the liberation of Paris. Nearly all downed American pilots who evaded capture were returned home to the United States for fear of being recaptured by the Germans and succumbing to torture that could reveal the French helpers and their Resistance networks.&lt;ref name=GOE/&gt; After Pisanos was moved back to the US, he was given the task of flight-testing captured enemy aircraft to analyze their performance.

==Career in the United States Air Force==
[[File:Steve Pisanos in 2009.jpg|right|thumb|Pisanos in 2009]]
After World War II, Pisanos flew the first operational United States jet fighter, the [[P-80 Shooting Star]]. After having a short career as a commercial pilot of 4-engined airliners with TWA, he returned to the United States Air Force due to his jet-flying experience as a Captain. Pisanos attended the USAF Flight Performance School (now the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]]) and graduated with class 45D.&lt;ref name=TPS50&gt;(1994) ''USAF Test Pilot School 50 Years and Beyond'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Major Pisanos was tasked with testing advanced jet fighters, namely the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], with which he often flew at the supersonic speed of Mach 1.5 at an altitude of 50,000 feet. He continued serving with other units, testing new weapons development. He also served in Vietnam and near the end of his career as a Colonel, and a member of JUSMAAG, helped the Hellenic Air Force to integrate the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4E Phantom II]] jet fighter.&lt;ref name=GOE/&gt; In 1974, he retired from the Air Force and lived in San Diego, California, with his wife Sofia.{{sfnp|Himchak|2009}}

==Retirement and death==
In 2008, Pisanos was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. ''These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame''. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-57864-397-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Pisanos was awarded the French [[Legion of Honor]], the French Republic's highest decoration, in a ceremony at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]]. The award, presented by the Consul General of France in Los Angeles, recognized Pisanos' outstanding achievements in World War II as a fighter pilot and in support of the French Resistance.{{sfnp|Lopez|2010}}

Pisanos died on June 6, 2016 from heart failure at his home in [[Rancho Bernardo, San Diego|Rancho Bernardo]], [[San Diego]], [[California]], aged 96.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofsandiego.com/military/2016/06/09/steve-pisanos-dies-at-96-famed-decorated-wwii-fighter-pilot/|title=Steve Pisanos Dies at 96: Famed Decorated WWII Fighter Pilot|publisher=Times of San Diego|accessdate=July 3, 2016|date=June 9, 2016|author=Ken Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61744">The following table shows the sequence of '''events of the Peninsular War''' (1807–1814). It includes major battles, smaller actions, uprisings, sieges and other related events that took place during that period.

For ease of reference using modern maps, the provinces/regions given for Spain and Portugal are those that correspond to the 20th century, that is, resulting from the 1976 [[Constitution of Portugal]] and the processes of [[devolution]] of [[Spanish transition to democracy|Spain's transition to democracy]] (1979), which created 17 [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities (regions)]] and 2 [[Autonomous cities of Spain|autonomous cities]]. This affects, in particular, the [[nationalities and regions of Spain|historical regions and provinces]] of [[León (historical region)|León]] and [[Old Castile]] (Spanish: ''Castilla la Vieja''), constituted in 1983 as [[Castile and León]]. Events in Portugal and France are specified.

==Overview==
{{Main article|Peninsular War}}
The Peninsular War{{Ref label|a|a|none}} was a military conflict for control of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], waged between [[First French Empire|France]] and the allied powers of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. It started when French and Spanish armies, then allied, occupied Portugal in 1807, and escalated in 1808 when France turned on Spain, its former ally. The war on the peninsula lasted until the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] defeated Napoleon in 1814, and is regarded as one of the first [[wars of national liberation]], and significant for the emergence of large-scale [[guerrilla warfare]]. British and Portuguese forces eventually secured Portugal, using it as a safe position from which to launch campaigns against the French army, while both Spanish and Portuguese guerrillas weakened the occupying forces.

The Peninsular War overlaps with what the [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking world]] calls the ''Guerra de la Independencia Española'' (Spanish War of Independence), which began with the [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]] on 2 May 1808 and ended on 17 April 1814. Although Spain had been in upheaval since at least the [[Mutiny of Aranjuez]] (March 1808), May 1808 marks the start of the Spanish War of Independence. The French occupation destroyed the [[Government of Spain|Spanish administration]], which fragmented into quarrelling [[Junta (Peninsular War)|provincial ''juntas'']]. In 1810, a reconstituted national government, the [[Cádiz Cortes]]{{mdash}}effectively a government-in-exile{{mdash}}fortified itself in [[Cádiz]] but could not raise effective armies because it was [[Siege of Cádiz|besieged]] by up to 70,000 French troops. The combined efforts of regular and irregular forces throughout the peninsula prevented Napoleon's [[Marshal of France#French Empire|marshals]] from subduing the rebellious Spanish provinces, and the war continued through years of stalemate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chandler |first=David |title=The Art of Warfare on Land |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stages of the Peninsular War were fought on French soil, as the French army was pushed further back across the [[Pyrenees]].

| &lt;small&gt; Following the fighting at the [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Royal Palace]], rebellion spread to other parts of the city, with street fighting in different areas including heavy fighting around the [[Puerta del Sol]], the Puerta de Toledo and at the barracks of Monteleón. Martial law was imposed on the city. Hundreds of people died in the fighting, including around 150 French soldiers. The uprising was depicted by the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]] in ''[[The Second of May 1808|The Second of May 1808 (The Charge of the Mamelukes)]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]''.&lt;/small&gt;

|&lt;small&gt;After having originally received orders from Murat to head for Cádiz, and countermanded by Napoleon, thinking that his troops might be needed in Madrid, [[Pierre Dupont de l'Étang|Dupont]] finally leaves Toledo with 18,000 second-line troops, originally raised as provisional or reserve formations, intended either for internal police services or garrison duty.&lt;/small&gt;

| [[Despeñaperros]]
| &lt;small&gt;[[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]], [[Andalusia]]&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;Spanish victory (guerrillas)&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;Two squadrons of French dragoons were attacked by insurgents at the northern entrance to the pass of Despenaperros, a steep gorge ([[Defile (geography)|defile]]) in the [[Sierra Morena]], that separates Castile-La Mancha (including Madrid) and Andalusia, and forced to retreat to the nearby town of [[Almuradiel]].&lt;/small&gt;

| &lt;small&gt;Uprising: Spanish victory&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;The 700 French troops stationed in the village of [[Santa Cruz de Mudela]] are attacked by the population. 109 French soldiers are killed and 113 taken prisoner, while the rest flee back in the direction of Madrid, to [[Valdepeñas]].&lt;/small&gt;

| 6 June 1808
| Porto (Uprising of)
| &lt;small&gt;[[Porto District|Porto]] (Portugal)&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;Uprising: Portuguese victory&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;On hearing of the rebellion in Spain, Spanish General [[Domingo Belestá|Belesta]], having participated in the [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|Invasion of Portugal]], and stationed in Porto with 6,000 Spanish troops, captures the French General of Division [[François Jean Baptiste Quesnel|Quesnel]], and marches to Coruña to join the fight against the French troops, sparking off a series of uprisings throughout the north of Portugal.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 6 June 1808
| [[Uprising of Valdepeñas|Valdepeñas (Uprising of)]]
| &lt;small&gt;[[Province of Ciudad Real|Ciudad Real]], [[Castile-La Mancha]]&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;Uprising: Spanish victory&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;Following the previous day's uprising in [[Santa Cruz de Mudela]], [[Ligier-Belair]] and Roize, at the head of some 800 troops, together with some 300 soldiers that had escaped from the Santa Cruz uprising prepare to march through the town of [[Valdepeñas]]. The population attack the leading column and Ligier-Belair sends in the dragoons, who are also forced to retreat. The resulting truce stipulates that the French troops will not pass through the village in return for a day's worth of food supplies. The guerrilla actions at Santa Cruz and Valdepeñas, together with more isolated actions in the Sierra Morena itself, effectively cut French military communications between Madrid and Andalusia for around a month.&lt;/small&gt;
|-
| 6 June 1808
| Coronation of Joseph I
| &lt;small&gt;[[Madrid]]&lt;/small&gt;
|
| &lt;small&gt;Napoleon's elder brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], proclaimed King of Spain.&lt;ref name=fremont/&gt; His reign lasted until 11 December 1813, when he abdicated and returned to France after the French defeat at the [[Battle of Vitoria]] in 1813.&lt;/small&gt;

| &lt;small&gt;See also Bruch (Second battle of). Often grouped together as one battle, there were in fact two separate battles, separated by more than a week, with different armies and commanders involved: of the 12 French regiments that participated, only one of them fought at both battles.&lt;/small&gt;

| [[Battle of Alcolea Bridge|Alcolea Bridge (Battle of)]]
| &lt;small&gt;[[Province of Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]], [[Andalusia]]&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;French victory&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;At [[Alcolea (Córdoba)|Alcolea]], 10&amp;nbsp;km from Córdoba, [[Pierre Dupont de l'Étang|Dupont]]'s troops are engaged in their first battle in Andalusia against 3,000 regular troops under Pedro Agustín de Echávarri who try to protect the bridge over the [[Guadalquivir]]. The same day, Dupont captures [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]].&lt;/small&gt;
|-

| [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]
| &lt;small&gt;[[Province of Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]], [[Andalusia]]&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;French victory&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt;On their way to [[Seville]], and ultimately to [[Cádiz]], [[Pierre Dupont de l'Étang|Dupont]]'s 18,000 troops capture Córdoba, ransacking the city over four days. However, damaging guerrilla actions force Dupont to withdraw towards Madrid to meet up with [[Jacques-Nicolas Gobert|Gobert]]'s division, that had set out from Madrid on July 2 to reinforce Dupont. Only one brigade of this division ultimately reached Dupont, the rest being needed to hold the road north (to Madrid) against the guerrillas.&lt;/small&gt;

| &lt;small&gt; Vedel, with the 6,000 men, 700 horse, and 12 guns of the 2nd Division, sets out south from Toledo to force a passage over the Sierra Morena, hold the mountains from the guerrillas, and link up with Dupont, pacifying Castile-La Mancha along the way.

The '''''Valor Ecclesiasticus''''' ([[Latin]]: "church valuation") was a survey of the finances of the church in England, [[Wales]] and English controlled parts of Ireland made in 1535 on the orders of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

In 1534, King Henry parted with the Pope and the Catholic religion and by the [[Act of Supremacy]] made himself the supreme head of the [[Christian Church|church]] in his lands. One of his first actions in his new role was to impose [[taxes]] on the clergy. Taxes traditionally paid by clerics to the Pope were now to be given to him, and Henry also decided in late 1534 to create a new annual [[income tax]] of 10% on the income from all church lands and offices. To properly assess the new tax a survey of all church property and revenues had to be made.

In January 1535, the government appointed commissions throughout the country to conduct the survey. All clergymen, parish priests, heads of [[monasteries]], colleges, hospitals and other institutions under church auspices were commanded to give sworn testimony before their local commissioners as to their income, the lands their establishments owned and the revenues they received from all other sources. The commissioners were to examine documents and account books and from these and the testimony provide a full financial statement for every religious institution. The work of collecting the information was ordered to be completed by 30 May 1535 and the results sent in to the [[Exchequer]] in London.

The commissioners were unpaid and untrained, mostly local [[gentry]], [[Mayor#English-Saxon mayors and counterparts|mayors]], [[magistrates]], [[bishops]] and [[sheriffs]], but they approached the vast task with speed and, by the summer of 1535, the government had in its hands a detailed [[bookkeeping|accounting]] of the property and wealth of the church. Most of their work survives, preserved in 22 [[Latin]] volumes and three folders at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in [[Kew]]. Two of the volumes are [[illuminated manuscript]]s and seem to be a summary made for King Henry's personal use.

==Accuracy==
The commissioners had no particular reason to be partial to the clergy and they applied themselves to the task with much diligence. Where the figures can be checked, for example against the financial records of the king's officials in charge of dissolving [[monasteries]] in the later 1530s, they are shown to be broadly accurate though on the low side, in some cases by as much as 15%. There is, particularly in the north, a tendency to underestimate the value of some important classes of asset, especially agricultural land held in [[desmesne]] and [[woodland]] with standing timber. One theory to account for this is the natural tendency of taxpayers to make conservative estimates combined with the rushed nature of the work, which encouraged the commissioners to give the benefit of the doubt.  Standing timber moreover, by its nature, provides a resource of occasional exceptional income, rather than a steady annual income stream, and hence was commonly ignored in income assessments for 16th century inventories of landed assets.

In a few instances the discrepancy is of so large a scale as to suggest deliberate fraud in the returns in the ''Valor Ecclesiasticus''; as was the case for example of [[Norton Priory]], where the submitted figure was so low as to render the abbey liable for suppression under the first (1536) statute for the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of lesser religious houses]].

==Significance==
The ''Valor'' gave the government for the first time a solid understanding of the scale of the wealth of the church as a whole and particularly of the monasteries. It was not long before King Henry began planning ways of seizing much of these riches for himself, starting with the smaller religious houses. Figures from the ''Valor'' were a vital part of the process of the [[Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535]], Henry's first move in the [[dissolution of the monasteries]], which dissolved all monasteries with a declared income of less than £200 per year.

The ''Valor'' is a document of the first importance for historians of the later [[Middle Ages|mediæval]] and [[Tudor period|Tudor]] church, the [[English Reformation]], and the Dissolution. It is also valuable to [[economic history|economic historians]] of the period.

Located on the lowermost slope of the northern mountain (Blackcomb Mountain), Whistler Sliding Centre hosted the [[bobsleigh]], [[luge]], and [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] competitions for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].

Design work started in late 2004 with construction taking place from June 2005 to December 2007. Bobsledders [[Pierre Lueders]] and [[Justin Kripps]] of Canada took the first run on the track on 19 December 2007. Certification took place in March 2008 with over 200 runs from six different start houses (the place where the sleds start their runs), and was approved both by the [[International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation]] (FIBT) and the [[International Luge Federation]] (FIL). Training runs took place in late 2008 in preparation for the World Cup events in all three sports in early 2009. World Cup competitions were held in February 2009 for bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton. The top speed for all World Cup events set by German luger [[Felix Loch]] at {{convert|153.98|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. In late 2009, more training took place in preparation for the Winter Olympics.

On 12 February 2010, the day of the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|Olympic opening ceremonies]], Georgian luger [[Nodar Kumaritashvili]] was killed during a training run while reportedly going {{convert|143.3|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This resulted in the [[Luge at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's singles|men's singles]] event being moved to the [[Luge at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Women's singles|women's singles]] and [[Luge at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Doubles|men's doubles]] start house while both the women's singles and men's doubles event were moved to the junior start house. During actual luge competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics, there were only two crashes, which resulted in one withdrawal. Skeleton races on 18–19 February had no crashes though two skeleton racers were disqualified for technical reasons. Bobsleigh competitions had crashes during all three events. This resulted in supplemental training for both the [[Bobsleigh at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Two-woman|two-woman]] and the [[Bobsleigh at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Four-man|four-man]] event following crashes during the [[Bobsleigh at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Two-man|two-man]] event. Modifications were made to the track after the two-man event to lessen the frequency of crashes as well. A 20-page report was released by the FIL to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) on 12 April 2010 and to the public on FIL's website on 19 April 2010 regarding Kumaritashvili's death. Safety concerns at Whistler affected the track design for the [[Sliding Center Sanki]] that was used for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]]. This included track simulation and mapping to reduce top speeds by {{convert|6|to|9|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} for the Sochi track.

Constructed on part of [[First Nations]] spiritual grounds, the track won two provincial concrete construction awards in 2008 while the refrigeration plant earned Canada's [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] "gold" certification two years later.

[[File:Whistler Sliding Centre-track map english.svg|thumb|left|alt=Map of a competition venue|The Whistler Sliding Centre track map]]

===Construction===
This venue was constructed on a [[First Nations]] designated site. According to the [[Squamish Nation|Squamish]], the area is referred to as a "Wild Spirit Place" or ''&lt;u&gt;K&lt;/u&gt;we&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;waye&lt;u&gt;x&lt;/u&gt; Kwelh7aynexw'' while the [[Lillooet Tribal Council|Lil'oet]] call the area ''A7x7ulmecw'' or "Spirited Ground".

Originally budgeted for C$55 million, the track's actual costs were C$105 million (€68 million).&lt;ref name=fil022309 /&gt; The track is made of {{convert|350|MT|LT ST|lk=on}} of reinforced concrete that was applied using pressurized spraying to reach a maximum thickness of {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=siteprep /&gt;&lt;ref name=worker /&gt;&lt;ref name=open2 /&gt; Additionally, the track contains {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} of steel conduit, 600 [[awning]]s, and 700 lights.

===Sustainability===
To promote sustainability, the site was selected directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the [[ecological footprint]] in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was [[compost]]ed for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sustainability and legacy information on the site selection area for the Whistler Sliding Centre.|publisher = VANOC|url = http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-spectator-guide/venues/the-whistler-sliding-centre/sustainability---legacy/|accessdate =10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
In 2008, the Sliding Centre received two British Columbia Ready-Mixed Concrete Association Awards for Excellence in Concrete Construction. The first award was for Public Works while the second one was for the Century Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2008 BC Awards for Excellence in Concrete Construction, including the Whistler Sliding Centre.|publisher = British Columbia Ready-Mixed Concrete Association|url = http://www.bcrmca.bc.ca/media/2008%20winners.pdf|accessdate = 10 December 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706165056/http://www.bcrmca.bc.ca/media/2008%20winners.pdf#|archive-date = 6 July 2011|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2006, VANOC targeted Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Canada by applying for "silver" green building certification for the {{convert|708|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} refrigeration plant building. The refrigeration plant received "gold" certification level on 2 February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Whistler Sliding Centre Refrigeration Building.|publisher = Canada Green Building Council|url = http://www.cagbc.org/leed/leed_projects/registered_projects/building_registrations10381.php?project_city=Whistler&amp;project_province=BC|accessdate =28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{Nowrap|[[Gold Rush]] Trail}} 
|Labyrinth of four curves without a straightaway. Named because a mistake on this part of the track could cost competitors a chance at a gold medal. It is also in reference to the [[British Columbia gold rushes]] that happened between 1850 and 1899.

Turn 13 of the Gold Rush Trail was christened "50/50" by American bobsledder Holcomb during the first day of four-man training in February 2009. 50% of the sleds crashed on Turn 13 on their runs that day. The next day, Holcomb posted the name on the wall of that turn, which the track manager approved. Holcomb's crew was also the first to go down the track that next day, successfully completing the run. The name stuck, being used in broadcast coverage of the [[Vancouver Olympics]]. Following Holcomb's death in 2017, turn 13 had his emblem (similar to [[Superman]]) embedded at the turn during the [[2017-18 Bobsleigh World Cup|2017-18 bobsleigh]], [[2017-18 Luge World Cup|luge]], and [[2017-18 Skeleton World Cup|skeleton World Cup season]].

Track [[g-forces]] were expected to reach up to 5.02 for men's singles luge.&lt;ref name=open2 /&gt; Maximum speed was reached at {{convert|147.9|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in four-man bobsleigh during the certification process.&lt;ref name=open2 /&gt;

==Track records==
The luge track records shown were set at the men's singles start house and women's singles/men's doubles start houses during the World Cup competition in February 2009. After Kumaritashvili's death on 12 February 2010, the competition for men's singles was moved to the women's singles/men's doubles start house while the competition for women's singles/ men's doubles was moved to the junior start house. The fastest runs set during the 2010 Winter Olympics are not on this list until an issue between the Whistler 2010 Sports Legacies and the FIL is resolved.

It is also known as '''office politics''' and '''organizational politics'''.
It is the use of power and [[social network]]ing within an organization to achieve changes that benefit the organization or individuals within it.

Both individuals and groups may engage in office politics&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Haight, [http://bigbadboss.com/OFFICE_POLITICS.html Office Politics],  BigBadBoss.com&lt;/ref&gt; which can be highly destructive, as people focus on personal gains at the expense of the organization. "Self-serving political actions can negatively influence our social groupings, cooperation, information sharing, and many other organizational functions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larsen|first=James|title=Business Psychology - Latest Findings|url=http://www.businesspsych.org/articles/209.html|work=Supervision Findings|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is vital to pay attention to organizational politics and create the right political landscape. "Politics is the lubricant that oils your organization's internal gears."&lt;ref name="Bolander"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolander|first=Jarie|title=How to Deal with Organizational Politics|date= 28 February 2011|url=http://www.thedailymba.com/2011/02/28/how-to-deal-with-organizational-politics/|work=The Daily MBA|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Office politics has also been described as "simply how power gets worked out on a practical, day-to-day basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lebarre, Polly|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/28/newface.html|title= The New Face of Office Politics|date=September 1999|work=Fast Company.com|publisher=Mansueto Ventures, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The political landscape==
Political landscape is a set of hierarchies that link the political players together. In other words, political landscape is what defines relationships between colleagues at a given time.  Drafting of this landscape begins with the leaders of the organization influencing the ''formal hierarchy''; which defines the reporting structure and indicates the political setup of the organization as it was initially intended.  Organizational hierarchies, each with its own unique political challenges, depend on many factors of the given organization. Said factors include organizational goals, size of the organization, number of resources available and the type of leaders within the organization. Political landscape will change as individuals are introduced into the organizational mix. 
During the process of working together an ''informal hierarchy'' is established. The main link between individuals on a political landscape is the access to-in addition to-the flow of information. This hierarchy can be identified by applying numerical values to relationships in proportion to how much two individuals rate and value one another. The sum value of these relating to an individual establishes the place on the hierarchy.  Two or more people estimating relationships and merging results can produce more certain results.  People quickly realize who the boss is, whom they depend on for valuable information, and who knows all the office gossip. It is very important to recognize where you fit in this landscape and what power and influence you have within the organization. It is important not only to use that power in pursuit of the organization's goals, but also to ensure others do not abuse it. "Each player in the organization has a role in the politics that grease the wheels of getting things done." &lt;ref name="Bolander"/&gt;

==Gossip==

Office politics differs from [[office gossip]] in that people participating in office politics do so with the objective of gaining advantage, whereas gossip can be a purely social activity. However, the two are somewhat related. Office gossip is often used by an individual to place themselves at a point where they can control the flow of information, and therefore gain maximum advantage. The secretive nature of organizational politics differentiates it from public gossip and thus, may be more harmful to the organization. Both can cause one to doubt the intentions of co-workers, which creates a [[hostile work environment]]. Office politics also refers to the way co-workers act among each other. Employee interaction holds the potential to  be either positive or negative (i.e. cooperative or competitive).

==Manipulation==

At the root of office politics is the issue of [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]]. Manipulation can be present in any relationship where one or more of the parties involved uses indirect means to achieve their goals. In the workplace, where resources are limited, individuals often have an incentive to achieve their goals at the expense of their colleagues. For example, if six people apply for one promotion, they might expect the selection to be made purely on merit. If one of the candidates were to believe that this would put them at a disadvantage, they may use other means of [[coercion]] or [[Social influence|influence]] to put themselves into an advantageous position. When those who have fallen subject to the manipulation begin to talk to each other directly—or when other evidence comes to light such as financial results—the manipulator will have an explanation ready but will already be planning their exit, as they are driven to stay in control, not to face a revelation which would expose their behavior.

==Aims==

The aims of office politics or manipulation in the workplace are not always increased pay or a promotion. Often, the goal may simply be greater power or control for its own end; or to discredit a competitor. Office politics do not necessarily stem from purely selfish gains.  They can be a route towards corporate benefits, which give a leg up to the company as a whole, not just an individual. "A 'manipulator' will often achieve career or personal goals by co-opting as many colleagues as possible into their plans."&lt;ref name="Mohsin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohsin|first=Muhammad|title=Being a Part of Office Politics Doesn't Save You From It (Part 1)|date= 16 November 2016|url=https://medium.com/@qmohsin300/being-a-part-of-office-politics-doesnt-save-you-from-it-part-1-e2d9784cd6a1#.26ufdwa67|work=Medium|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the hidden agenda is a personal victory, allying with unsuspecting co-workers strengthens the manipulator's personal position and ensures that they will be the last person accused of wrongdoing.

==Issues==

Office politics is a major issue in business because the individuals who manipulate their working relationships consume time and resources for their own gain at the expense of the team or company.

In addition to this problem, the practice of office politics can have an even more serious effect on major business processes such as strategy formation, budget setting, performance management, and leadership. This occurs because when individuals are playing office politics, it interferes with the information flow of a company. Information can be distorted, misdirected, or suppressed, in order to manipulate a situation for short-term personal gain.&lt;ref name="games"/&gt;

==Games==
{{See also|Mind games}}
One way of analyzing office politics in more detail is to view it as a series of games.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, Eric, ''Games People Play: The Psychology of Human Relationships'', Jan. 2010, Penguin Books Ltd., {{ISBN|978-0-14-104027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games can be analyzed and described in terms of the type of game and the payoff. Interpersonal games are games that are played between peers (for example the game of "No Bad News" where individuals suppress negative information, and the payoff is not risking upsetting someone); leadership games are played between supervisor and employee (for example the game of "[[Divide and rule|Divide and Conquer]]" where the supervisor sets his employees against each other, with the payoff that none threatens his power base); and budget games are played with the resources of an organization (for example the game of "Sandbagging" where individuals negotiate a low sales target, and the payoff is a bigger bonus).&lt;ref name="games"&gt;[http://www.games-at-work.com/game-of-the-month Games At Work - How to recognize and reduce office politics] Goldstein, Read and Cashman April 2009, Jossey Bass Wiley, {{ISBN|978-0-470-26200-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dealing with organizational politics==

Organizational politics is itself similar to a game, one that requires an assumption of risks just like any contact sport. "It must be played with diligence and a full understanding of the landscape, players and rules."&lt;ref name="Bolander"/&gt;  "The dynamics of the situation should always dictate a reexamination of the players and how they fit into the landscape."&lt;ref name="Bolander"/&gt;  One must be careful relying on alliances made on previous circumstances; once the situation changes, alliances need to be reassessed. Building strong alliances will maximize the efficiency of the collective political radar and alert you before conflicts arise. In time of conflict, data-driven employees who rely on hard facts will have an easier time diffusing political conflicts. Always looking out for the best interests of your company is a certain way to ensure that your motivation will remain unquestioned.  L.A. Witt, from the University of New Orleans, through his findings, believes that if supervisors were to mold employee values to match their own, it would protect employees from the negative effects of organizational politics and help improve their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larsen|first=James|title=Organizational Politics|url=http://www.businesspsych.org/articles/209.html|work=Business Psychology|publisher=© Management Resources|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About-distinguish|the occasional conferences organised by the [[International Association for Tamil Research]]|World Classical Tamil Conference 2010}}

The '''World Tamil Conference''' ({{lang-ta|உலகத் தமிழ் மாநாடு}}) is a series of occasional conferences to discuss the social growth of the [[Tamil language]]. Each conference is attended by thousands of Tamil enthusiasts around the world. Conferences are hosted in various cities in India, as well as world cities with a significant Tamil population. The conference aims in promoting the heritage of Tamil language.

A similar conference called [[World Classical Tamil Conference 2010]], unapproved by the [[International Association for Tamil Research]], was held in Tamil Nadu conducted by the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] under the leadership of [[M. Karunanidhi]]. Not all agreed with the academic and intellectual rigour of the latter event. Despite these criticisms upholding such a huge event portraying the value of Tamil language and culture is being appreciated vastly and credited to the DMK supremo as commonly believed by the people in the state of Tamil Nadu. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/06/karunanidhi-and-politics-of-tamil.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://transcurrents.com/tc/2010/06/world_tamil_classical_conferen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-political-uses-of-tamil/638301/0&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Youth Day 2011''' was the 2011 occurrence of [[World Youth Day]], a  [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] event held from August 16–21, 2011 in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] focused on youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/gmg/documents/gmg_chronicle-wyd_20020325_en.html|title=Chronicle of World Youth Days|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media estimated the event's attendance as over a million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2011/08/world-youth-day-pope-benedict-spain/1|title=Pope's youth day draws a million -- and controversies|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2011/aug/18/pope-madrid-world-youth-day|title=The pope draws 1.5 million young people to Madrid – but that's not news? - Andrew Brown|first=Andrew|last=Brown|date=18 August 2011|website=the Guardian|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] revealed the location of the event at the final [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in [[Australia]] at [[Sydney]]'s [[Randwick Racecourse|Royal Randwick Racecourse]] during [[World Youth Day 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/world/asia/20pope.html?hp "Pope Calls for a ‘New Age’ in Final Australia Mass"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the second time that Spain hosted the event. [[World Youth Day 1989]] was held from August 15&amp;ndash;20 1989 at [[Santiago de Compostela]].

Spanish bishops, including Madrid's Metropolitan Archbishop, Cardinal [[Antonio Maria Rouco Varela]], and the coordinator of the World Youth Day 2011, Madrid Auxiliary Bishop César Franco Martínez, urged [[Pope Benedict XVI]] to name patrons for the event. Saint [[Rafael Arnáiz Barón]], Saint [[Francis Xavier]], Saint [[Isidore the Laborer]], Saint [[Maria Torribia]], Saint [[Teresa of Avila]], Saint [[Ignatius of Loyola]], Saint [[John of Avila]], Saint [[Rose of Lima]], Saint [[John of the Cross]], and [[Pope John Paul II]] were all designated as co-patrons of World Youth Day 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=34355|title=Spanish Bishops Propose Youth Day Patron|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/index_saints_en.html#11+ottobre+2009,+Piazza+San+Pietro|title=Saints proclaimed during the Pontificate of John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:8.30pm: Vigil with the Pope: The Pope arrived at Cuatro Vientos to celebrate an [[Eucharistic adoration]].
:11.00pm: Night in Cuatro Vientos: From early in the morning, pilgrims arrived at Cuatro Vientos, but were not able to adore the eucharist as planned because of the storm that damaged the chapels. The stage was designed by Ignacio Vicens, an architect who had assisted with World Youth Day celebrations during the time of John Paul II.
The number of people attending exceeded expectations, which means more land had to be found round the edges to accommodate the people. An estimated 1,000,000 were in the aerodrome at seven o'clock in the evening, which made this the largest Catholic event ever staged in Spain. Many pilgrims walked from the centre of Madrid (12.6&amp;nbsp;km), although extra public transport was put on.

The Pope arrived and a cross was carried in procession to the altar. Several young people were picked to ask questions to the Pope, but a sudden thunderstorm and high winds, meant that the Pope's address had to be communicated to the crowd in written form.

The Pope resumed the adoration of the Eucharist, after the rain, although with a shortened programme. A mass with distribution of the Eucharist to many in the crowd had to be reduced in dimension.

Many stayed during the night, and the Sunday morning mass took on a larger dimension to make up for the day before.

:9.30am: Final Mass: The Pope concelebrated Mass with thousands of bishops and priests. At the end of the concluding Mass, the Pope announced the place where the next edition of World Youth Day would be held.

On August 17 a demonstration against public funding of the World Youth Day and for a Spanish secular state took place in Madrid. The protesters were confronted by [[riot police]] with [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]]. Eight people were arrested and eleven were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/08/18/pope-madrid-protests.html|title=Anti-Pope protests in Madrid injure 11|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2011-08-18|date=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests centred on the Pope and the number of protestors never reached beyond a few thousand. No WYD events were interrupted by their demonstrations. There were a few scuffles between pilgrims and the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2011/08/18/anti-pope-protesters-confront-madrid-police-and-catholic-wyd-pilgrims-pix/ | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 2011, at the closing Mass, the Pope revealed that the next event will be held in 2013 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. The location was leaked a few months before this however.
