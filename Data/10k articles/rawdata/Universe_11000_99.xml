In cellular biology, '''active transport''' is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration—against the concentration gradient. Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: '''primary active transport''' that uses [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and '''secondary active transport''' that uses an electrochemical gradient. An example of active transport in [[human physiology]] is the uptake of [[glucose]] in the [[gastrointestinal tract|intestines]].

== Cellular transportation mechanisms ==

Active transport is the movement of [[molecule]]s across a [[membrane]] from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentration—against the concentration [[gradient]] or other obstructing factor.

Unlike [[passive transport]], which uses the [[kinetic energy]] and natural [[entropy]] of molecules moving down a gradient, active transport uses cellular energy to move them against a gradient, polar repulsion, or other resistance. Active transport is usually associated with accumulating high concentrations of molecules that the cell needs, such as [[ion]]s, [[glucose]] and [[amino acid]]s. If the process uses chemical energy, such as from [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), it is termed primary active transport. Secondary active transport involves the use of an [[electrochemical gradient]]. Examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose in the intestines in humans and the uptake of mineral ions into [[root hair]] cells of plants.&lt;ref name="Active Transport Process"&gt;{{cite web|title=The importance of homeostasis |work=Science |publisher=me |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_ocr_pre_2011/homeostasis/importancerev6.shtml |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1848, the German physiologist [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] suggested the possibility of active transport of substances across membranes.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois-Reymond, E. (1848–84). ''Untersuchungen über thierische Elektricität'' Berlin: Reimer. (Vol. 1, Part 1, 1848; Vol. 1, Part 2, 1849; Vol. 2, Part 1, 1860; Vol. 2, Part 2, 1884).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg (1948) formulated the concept of active transport based on energetic considerations,&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, T. (1948). On accumulation and active transport in biological systems. I. Thermodynamic considerations. ''Acta Chem. Scand.'' 2, 14-33, [http://actachemscand.org/doi/10.3891/acta.chem.scand.02-0014].&lt;/ref&gt; but later it would be redefined.

In 1997, [[Jens Christian Skou]], a Danish [[physician]] &lt;ref name="Jens C 2014"&gt;"Jens C. Skou - Biographical". Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web. 11 Nov 2017&lt;/ref&gt; received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his research regarding the [[sodium-potassium pump]] &lt;ref name="Jens C 2014"/&gt;

One category of cotransporters that is especially prominent in research regarding diabetes treatment &lt;ref&gt;Inzucchi, Silvio E et al. “SGLT-2 Inhibitors and Cardiovascular Risk: Proposed Pathways and Review of Ongoing Outcome Trials.” Diabetes &amp; Vascular Disease Research 12.2 (2015): 90–100. PMC. Web. 11 Nov. 2017&lt;/ref&gt; is sodium glucose cotransporters. These transporters were discovered by scientists at the National Health Institute.&lt;ref name="niddk.nih.gov"&gt;Story of Discovery: SGLT2 Inhibitors: Harnessing the Kidneys to Help Treat Diabetes.” National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, www.niddk.nih.gov/news/research-updates/Pages/story-discovery-SGLT2-inhibitors-harnessing-kidneys-help-treat-diabetes.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists had noticed a discrepancy in the absorption of glucose at different points in the kidney tubule of a rat. The gene was then discovered for intestinal glucose transport protein and linked to these membrane sodium glucose cotransport systems. The first of these membrane transport proteins was named [[SLC5A1|SGLT1]] followed by the discovery of [[SGLT2]].&lt;ref name="niddk.nih.gov"/&gt; [[Robert K. Crane#Discovery of cotransport|Robert Krane]] also played a prominent role in this field.

==Background==
Specialized [[transmembrane protein]]s recognize the [[Chemical substance|substance]] and allow it to move across the membrane when it otherwise would not, either because the [[phospholipid bilayer]] of the membrane is impermeable to the substance moved or because the substance is moved against the direction of its [[concentration gradient]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/active-transport-process.html Active Transport Process]. Buzzle.com (2010-05-14). Retrieved on 2011-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of active transport, primary active transport and secondary active transport. In primary active transport, the proteins involved are pumps that normally use chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary active transport, however, makes use of potential energy, which is usually derived through exploitation of an [[electrochemical]] gradient. The energy created from one ion moving down its electrochemical gradient is used to power the transport of another ion moving against its electrochemical gradient.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al. Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition. New York: W. H. Freeman; 2000. Section 15.6, Cotransport by Symporters and Antiporters. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21687/&lt;/ref&gt; This involves pore-forming [[proteins]] that form channels across the [[cell membrane]]. The difference between passive transport and active transport is that the active transport requires energy, and moves substances against their respective concentration gradient, whereas passive transport requires no energy and moves substances in the direction of their respective concentration gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al. Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition. New York: W. H. Freeman; 2000. Chapter 15, Transport across Cell Membranes. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21525/&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[antiporter]], one substrate is transported in one direction across the membrane while another is [[cotransport]]ed in the opposite direction.  In a [[symporter]], two substrates are transported in the same direction across the membrane. Antiport and symport processes are associated with [[secondary active transport]], meaning that one of the two substances is transported against its concentration gradient, utilizing the energy derived from the transport of another ion (mostly Na{{Sup|+}}, K{{Sup|+}} or H{{Sup|+}} ions) down its concentration gradient.

If substrate molecules are moving from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biologycorner.com/bio1/active.html Active Transport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824003030/http://www.biologycorner.com/bio1/active.html |date=August 24, 2011 }}. Biologycorner.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., in the opposite direction as, or ''against'' the concentration gradient), specific transmembrane carrier proteins are required. These proteins have receptors that bind to specific molecules (e.g., [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|glucose]]) and transport them across the cell membrane. Because energy is required in this process, it is known as 'active' transport. Examples of active transport include the transportation of [[sodium]] out of the cell and [[potassium]] into the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Active transport often takes place in the internal lining of the [[small intestine]].

Plants need to absorb mineral salts from the soil or other sources, but these salts exist in very dilute [[solution]]. Active transport enables these cells to take up salts from this dilute solution against the direction of the [[concentration gradient]]. For example, the molecules [[chlorine]] (Cl^-) and [[nitrate]] NO3- exist in the cytosol of plant cells, and need to be transported into the vacuole. While the vacuole has channels for these ions, transportation of them is against the concentration gradient, and thus movement of these ions is driven by hydrogen pumps, or proton pumps&lt;ref&gt;Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.

==Primary active transport==

[[Image:Scheme sodium-potassium pump-en.svg|thumb|The action of the [[sodium-potassium pump]] is an example of primary active transport.]]
Primary active transport, also called direct active transport, directly uses metabolic energy to transport molecules across a membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substances that are transported across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions, such as [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[potassium|K]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[magnesium|Mg]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[calcium|Ca]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. These charged particles require [[Ion transporter|ion pump]]s or [[ion channel]]s to cross membranes and distribute through the body.

Most of the [[enzyme]]s that perform this type of transport are transmembrane [[ATPase]]s. A primary ATPase universal to all animal life is the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]], which helps to maintain the [[Membrane potential|cell potential]]. The sodium-potassium pump maintains the membrane potential by moving three Na+  ions out of the cell for every two &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tenth Edition, Campbell's Biology|last=Reese|first=Jane B.|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa A.|last3=Cain|first3=Michael L.|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven A.|last5=Minorsky|first5=Peter V.|last6=Jackson|first6=Robert B.|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-321-77565-8|location=United States|pages=135|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt; K+ ions moved into the cell. Other sources of energy for Primary active transport are [[redox]] energy and [[photon]] energy ([[light]]).  An example of primary active transport using Redox energy is the mitochondrial [[electron transport chain]] that uses the reduction energy of [[NADH]] to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane against their concentration gradient.  An example of primary active transport using light energy are the proteins involved in [[photosynthesis]] that use the energy of photons to create a proton gradient across the [[thylakoid membrane]] and also to create reduction power in the form of [[NADPH]].

===Model of active transport===

[[ATP hydrolysis]] is used to transport hydrogen ions against the [[electrochemical gradient]] (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration). [[Phosphorylation]] of the [[carrier protein]] and the binding of a [[hydrogen ion]] induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the electrochemical gradient. [[Hydrolysis]] of the bound [[phosphate group]] and release of hydrogen ion then restores the carrier to its original conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey|title=The Cell: A Molecular Approach|year=2009|publisher=ASM PRESS|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780878933006|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of  primary active transporters ==

#[[P-type ATPase]]: [[sodium potassium pump]], [[calcium pump]], [[proton pump]]
#[[F-ATPase]]: mitochondrial ATP synthase, chloroplast ATP synthase
# [[V-ATPase]]: vacuolar ATPase
# ABC ([[ATP binding cassette]]) transporter: MDR, CFTR, etc.

Adenosine Triphosphate-binding cassette transporters ([[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ABC transporters]]) comprise a large and diverse protein family, often functioning as ATP-driven pumps.  Usually, there are several domains involved in the overall transporter protein's structure, including two nucleotide-binding domains that constitute the ATP-binding motif and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that create the "pore" component.  In broad terms, ABC transporters are involved in the import or export of molecules across a cell membrane; yet within the protein family there is an extensive range of function.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Joohyun|last2=Park|first2=Jiyoung|date=December 6, 2011|title=Plant ABC Transporters|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268509/pdf/tab.0153.pdf|journal=American Society of Plant Biologists|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1199/tab.0153|pmc=3268509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, ABC transporters are often found within cell and organelle membranes, such as the mitochondria, chloroplast, and plasma membrane.  There is evidence to support that plant ABC transporters play a direct role in pathogen response, phytohormone transport, and detoxification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Furthermore, certain plant ABC transporters may function in actively exporting volatile compounds&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adebesin|first=Funmilayo|date=June 30, 2017|title=Emission of volatile organic compounds from petunia flowers is facilitated by an ABC transporter|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/356/6345/1386.full.pdf|journal=Plant Science|volume=356|pages=1386–1388|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; and antimicrobial metabolites.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crouzet|first=Jerome|date=April 7, 2013|title=NtPDR1, a plasma membrane ABC transporter from Nicotiana tabacum, is involved in diterpene transport|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/356/6345/1386.full.pdf|journal=Plant Molecular Biology|volume=82|pages=181–192|via=SpringerLink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In petunia flowers (''Petunia hybrida''), the ABC transporter PhABCG1 is involved in the active transport of volatile organic compounds.  PhABCG1 is expressed in the petals of open flowers.  In general, volatile compounds may promote the attraction of seed-dispersal organisms and pollinators, as well as aid in defense, signaling, allelopathy, and protection.  To study the protein PhABCG1, transgenic petunia RNA interference lines were created with decreased ''PhABCG1'' expression levels.  In these transgenic lines, a decrease in emission of volatile compounds was observed.  Thus, PhABCG1 is likely involved in the export of volatile compounds.  Subsequent experiments involved incubating control and transgenic lines that expressed ''PhABCG1'' to test for transport activity involving different substrates.    Ultimately, PhABCG1 is responsible for the protein-mediated transport of volatile organic compounds, such as benezyl alcohol and methylbenzoate, across the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Additionally in plants, ABC transporters may be involved in the transport of cellular metabolites.  Pleiotropic Drug Resistance ABC transporters are hypothesized to be involved in stress response and export antimicrobial metabolites.  One example of this type of ABC transporter is the protein NtPDR1.  This unique ABC transporter is found in ''Nicotiana tabacum'' BY2 cells and is expressed in the presence of microbial elicitors.  NtPDR1 is localized in the root epidermis and aerial trichomes of the plant.  Experiments using antibodies specifically targeting NtPDR1 followed by Western blotting allowed for this determination of localization.  Furthermore, it is likely that the protein NtPDR1 actively transports out antimicrobial diterpene molecules, which are toxic to the cell at high levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Secondary active transport==
[[Image:Scheme secundary active transport-en.svg|thumb|Secondary active transport]]
In secondary active transport, also known as ''coupled transport'' or ''cotransport'', energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to [[primary active transport]], there is no direct coupling of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]; instead it relies upon the [[electrochemical potential|electrochemical potential difference]] created by pumping ions in/out of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|7/7ch05/7ch05p12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases [[entropy]] and can serve as a source of [[energy]] for [[metabolism]] (e.g. in [[ATP synthase]]). The energy derived from the pumping of protons across a cell membrane is frequently used as the energy source in secondary active transport. In humans, sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is a commonly [[co-transport]]ed ion across the plasma membrane, whose electrochemical gradient is then used to power the active transport of a second ion or molecule against its gradient.&lt;ref name="Alberts B 2002"&gt;Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, et al.

In August 1960, in Prague, [[Robert K. Crane]] presented for the first time his discovery of the sodium-glucose cotransport as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Robert K. Crane |first1=Robert K. |last1=Crane |first2=D. |last2=Miller |first3=I. |last3=Bihler |chapter=The restrictions on possible mechanisms of intestinal transport of sugars |editor=Kleinzeller, A. |editor2=Kotyk, A. |title=Membrane Transport and Metabolism.

Crane|Crane]] in 1961 was the first to formulate the cotransport  concept to explain active transport [7]. Specifically, he proposed that the accumulation of glucose in the intestinal epithelium across the brush border membrane was coupled to downhill {{chem|Na|+}} transport cross the brush border. This hypothesis was rapidly tested, refined and extended [to] encompass the active transport of a diverse range of molecules and ions into virtually every cell type.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Boyd CA |title=Facts, fantasies and fun in epithelial physiology |journal=Exp. Physiol. |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=303–14 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18192340 |doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2007.037523 |quote=p. 304. “the insight from this time that remains in all current text books is the notion of [[Robert K. Crane|Robert Crane]] published originally as an appendix to a symposium paper published in 1960 ([[Robert K. Crane|Crane]] et al. 1960). The key point here was 'flux coupling', the cotransport of sodium and glucose in the apical membrane of the small intestinal epithelial cell. Half a century later this idea has turned into one of the most studied of all transporter proteins (SGLT1), the sodium–glucose cotransporter.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cotransporter]]s can be classified as [[symporter]]s and [[antiporter]]s depending on whether the substances move in the same or opposite directions.

===Antiporter===
[[Image:Porters.PNG|right|thumb|Function of [[symporter]]s and [[antiporter]]s.]]
In an antiporter two species of ion or other solutes are pumped in opposite directions across a membrane. One of these species is allowed to flow from high to low concentration which yields the [[entropy|entropic]] energy to drive the transport of the other solute from a low concentration region to a high one.

An example is the [[sodium-calcium exchanger]] or [[antiporter]], which allows three sodium ions into the cell to transport one calcium out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=SP|last2=Choi|first2=DW|title=Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange currents in cortical neurons: concomitant forward and reverse operation and effect of glutamate.|journal=The European Journal of Neuroscience|date=June 1997|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1273–81|pmid=9215711|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.1997.tb01482.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This antiporter mechanism is important within the membranes of cardiac muscle cells in order to keep the calcium concentration in the cytoplasm low.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; Many cells also possess [[calcium ATPase]]s, which can operate at lower intracellular concentrations of calcium and sets the normal or resting concentration of this important [[second messenger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strehler|first1=EE|last2=Zacharias|first2=DA|title=Role of alternative splicing in generating isoform diversity among plasma membrane calcium pumps.|journal=Physiological Reviews|date=January 2001|volume=81|issue=1|pages=21–50|pmid=11152753}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the ATPase exports calcium ions more slowly: only 30 per second versus 2000 per second by the exchanger. The exchanger comes into service when the calcium concentration rises steeply or "spikes" and enables rapid recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=M|last2=Sneyd|first2=J|last3=Friel|first3=DD|title=Depolarization-induced calcium responses in sympathetic neurons: relative contributions from Ca2+ entry, extrusion, ER/mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release, and Ca2+ buffering.|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|date=January 2007|volume=129|issue=1|pages=29–56|pmid=17190902|doi=10.1085/jgp.200609660|pmc=2151609}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that a single type of ion can be transported by several enzymes, which need not be active all the time (constitutively), but may exist to meet specific, intermittent needs.

=== Symporter ===

A [[symporter]] uses the downhill movement of one [[solution|solute species]] from high to low concentration to move another molecule uphill from low concentration to high concentration (against its [[concentration gradient]]). Both molecules are transported in the same direction.

An example is the glucose symporter [[Sodium-glucose transport proteins|SGLT1]], which co-transports one [[glucose]] (or [[galactose]]) molecule into the cell for every two sodium ions it imports into the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=EM|last2=Loo|first2=DD|last3=Panayotova-Heiermann|first3=M|last4=Lostao|first4=MP|last5=Hirayama|first5=BH|last6=Mackenzie|first6=B|last7=Boorer|first7=K|last8=Zampighi|first8=G|title='Active' sugar transport in eukaryotes.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=November 1994|volume=196|pages=197–212|pmid=7823022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[symporter]] is located in the small intestines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyer|first1=J|last2=Hosie|first2=KB|last3=Shirazi-Beechey|first3=SP|title=Nutrient regulation of human intestinal sugar transporter (SGLT2) expression.|journal=Gut|date=July 1997|volume=41|issue=1|pages=56–9|pmid=9274472|doi=10.1136/gut.41.1.56|pmc=1027228}}&lt;/ref&gt; heart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=L|last2=Cryan|first2=EV|last3=D'Andrea|first3=MR|last4=Belkowski|first4=S|last5=Conway|first5=BR|last6=Demarest|first6=KT|title=Human cardiomyocytes express high level of Na+/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT2).|journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry|date=1 October 2003|volume=90|issue=2|pages=339–46|pmid=14505350|doi=10.1002/jcb.10631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poppe|first1=R|last2=Karbach|first2=U|last3=Gambaryan|first3=S|last4=Wiesinger|first4=H|last5=Lutzenburg|first5=M|last6=Kraemer|first6=M|last7=Witte|first7=OW|last8=Koepsell|first8=H|title=Expression of the Na+-D-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 in neurons.|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|date=July 1997|volume=69|issue=1|pages=84–94|pmid=9202297|doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.69010084.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also located in the S3 segment of the [[proximal tubule]] in each [[nephron]] in the [[kidney]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Wright EM|year=2001|title=Renal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-glucose cotransporters|journal=Am J Physiol Renal Physiol|pmid=11133510|volume=280|issue=1|pages=F10–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its mechanism is exploited in [[Oral rehydration therapy|glucose rehydration therapy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loo|first1=DD|last2=Zeuthen|first2=T|last3=Chandy|first3=G|last4=Wright|first4=EM|title=Cotransport of water by the Na+/glucose cotransporter.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=12 November 1996|volume=93|issue=23|pages=13367–70|pmid=8917597|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.23.13367|pmc=24099}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism uses the absorption of sugar through the walls of the intestine to pull water in along with it.&lt;ref&gt;Loo, Donald D.; Zeuthan, Thomas; Chandy, Grischa; Wright, Ernest M.

==Bulk transport==
{{Main|Endocytosis|Exocytosis}}

[[Endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]] are both forms of [[Solvent drag|bulk transport]] that move materials into and out of cells, respectively, via [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tenth Addition Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane|last2=Urry|first2=Lisa|last3=Cain|first3=Michael|last4=Wasserman|first4=Steven|last5=Minorsky|first5=Peter|last6=Jackson|first6=Robert|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc|year=2014|isbn=978-0-321-77565-8|location=United States of America|pages=137|edition=Tenth Addition}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of endocytosis, the cellular membrane folds around the desired materials outside the cell.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mboc4&amp;part=A2383 Transport into the Cell from the Plasma Membrane: Endocytosis – Molecular Biology of the Cell – NCBI Bookshelf].

==Design==
[[File:ILA 2018, Schönefeld (1X7A5549).jpg|thumb|The left [[laminar flow]] wing section]]

Natural laminar flow is opposed to hybrid laminar flow artificially induced through hardware.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight4sep2017/&gt;--&gt;
It is difficult to industrialise a wing smooth enough with very low design and manufacturing tolerances and aerodynamically robust enough to sustain the laminar flow in operations, with leading edge retractable slats, fasteners, surface deformations and dirt, de-icing fluid and rain droplets contamination disturbances.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight4sep2017/&gt;--&gt;
The {{cvt|9|m}} metallic outboard section with a [[carbon fiber reinforced plastic]] upper laminar flow surface is isolated from the rest of the wing and has two ailerons on each side.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight4sep2017/&gt;--&gt;
Its [[wing sweep]] is around 20° for a Mach 0.75 cruise instead of 30° for Mach 0.82-0.84, laminar flow is expected along 50% of chord length instead of just aft of the leading edge, halving the wing [[friction drag]], reducing the overall aircraft drag by 8% and saving up to 5% in fuel on an 800nm (1,480km) sector.&lt;ref name=Flight4sep2017&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-airbus-readies-laminar-winged-a340-for-tes-440780/ |title= Airbus readies laminar-winged A340 for test flights |date= 4 Sep 2017 |author= Michael Gubisch |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

In April 2018, after 66 flight hours, drag reduction is better than expected at 10% and laminar flow is more stable than anticipated, including when the [[wing twist]]s and flexes.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight24apr2018&gt;--&gt;
Both wings with their carbonfibre upper sustainably generate the desired effect, while the carbonfibre left wing [[leading edge]] and metallic right wing leading edge have small differences in aerodynamic effects.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight24apr2018&gt;--&gt;
The aerodynamic benefits could be sustained at Mach 0.78 up from M0.75 and next-generation [[single-aisle]]s could use from the late 2020s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight24apr2018&gt;--&gt;

They usually form at the crests of atmospheric waves, which would otherwise be invisible. This species of cirrocumulus can often be quite elongated and normally has very distinguished boundaries.

==Uses==
During the 1800s, conical pendulums were used as the timekeeping element in a few clockwork timing mechanisms where a smooth motion was required, as opposed to the unavoidably jerky motion provided by ordinary pendulums.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;  Two examples were mechanisms to turn the lenses of [[lighthouse]]s to sweep their beams across the sea, and the location drives of [[equatorial mount]] [[telescope]]s, to allow the telescope to follow a star smoothly across the sky as the Earth turns.&lt;ref name="Grimsthorpe"/&gt;

One of the most important uses of the conical pendulum was in the flyball governor ([[centrifugal governor]]) invented by [[James Watt]] in 1788 which regulated the speed of steam engines during the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|Steam Age]] in the 1800s.  The playground game [[tetherball]] uses a ball attached to a pole by a cord which functions as a conical pendulum, although the pendulum gets shorter as the cord wraps around the pole.  Some [[amusement park ride]]s act as conical pendulums.

==Analysis==
Consider a conical pendulum consisting of a [[Bob (physics)|bob]] of mass ''m'' revolving without friction in a circle at a constant speed ''v'' on a string of length ''L'' at an angle of ''θ'' from the vertical.

There are two forces acting on the bob:
*the tension ''T'' in the string, which is exerted along the line of the string and acts toward the point of suspension.
*the downward bob [[weight]] ''mg'', where ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the bob and ''g'' is the local [[gravitational acceleration]].

The force exerted by the string can be resolved into a horizontal component, ''T''&amp;nbsp;sin(''θ''), toward the center of the circle, and a vertical component, ''T''&amp;nbsp;cos(''θ''), in the upward direction.  From [[Newton's second law]], the horizontal component of the tension in the string gives the bob a [[centripetal acceleration]] toward the center of the circle:

:&lt;math&gt;T \sin \theta =  \frac {mv^2}{r} \,&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Conical pendulum.svg|thumb|right|250px|Conical pendulum whose bob travels in a horizontal circle of radius ''r''.  The bob has mass ''m'' and is suspended by a string of length ''L''.  The tension force of the string acting on the bob is the vector ''T'', and the bob's weight is the vector ''mg''.]]
Since there is no acceleration in the vertical direction, the vertical component of the tension in the string is equal and opposite to the weight of the bob:

:&lt;math&gt;T \cos \theta = mg \,&lt;/math&gt;

These two equations can be solved for ''T''/''m'' and equated, thereby eliminating ''T'' and ''m'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{g} {\cos\theta} = \frac {v^2} {r\sin \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the speed of the pendulum bob is constant, it can be expressed as the circumference 2''πr'' divided by the time ''t'' required for one revolution of the bob:

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac {2\pi r}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the right side of this equation for ''v'' in the previous equation, we find:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {g} {\cos \theta}
= \frac {( \frac {2 \pi r} {t} )^2} {r \sin \theta}
= \frac {(2 \pi)^2 r} {t^2 \sin \theta}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the trigonometric identity tan(''θ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sin(''θ'')&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;cos(''θ'') and solving for ''t'', the time required for the bob to travel one revolution is

:&lt;math&gt;t = 2 \pi \sqrt {\frac {r} {g \tan \theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

In a practical experiment, ''r'' varies and is not as easy to measure as the constant string length ''L''.  ''r'' can be eliminated from the equation by noting that ''r'', ''h'', and ''L'' form a right triangle, with ''θ'' being the angle between the leg ''h'' and the hypotenuse ''L'' (see diagram).  Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;r = L \sin \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this value for ''r'' yields a formula whose only varying parameter is the suspension angle&amp;nbsp;''θ'':&lt;ref name="Serway"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t = 2 \pi \sqrt { \frac {L \cos \theta} {g} }&lt;/math&gt;

For small angles ''θ'', cos(''θ'')&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1, and the period ''t'' of a conical pendulum is equal to the period of an ordinary pendulum of the same length.  Also, the period for small angles is approximately independent of changes in the angle ''θ''.  This means the period of rotation is approximately independent of the force applied to keep it rotating.  This property, called [[:wikt:isochronous|isochronism]], is shared with ordinary pendulums and makes both types of pendulums useful for timekeeping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7858">== Application of Conductivity in Steam Analysis ==
[[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|Conductivity]] measurements in the water/steam cycle of [[power station]]s are commonly used as indicators of the quality of the water used in the process.  Excessive conductivity values often indicate a high [[corrosion]] potential, especially in the case of certain ions such as [[chloride]] and [[acetate]] ions.  These can be particularly damaging to the blades in the [[steam turbine]].

Typically, there are three major types of conductivity measurements used:
* Specific conductivity, a measurement that indicates the total dissolved solids in an aqueous solution
* Cation conductivity, a measurement taken after the water sample has flowed through a resin bed (known as a cation exchanger)
* Degas conductivity, a measurement taken after the water sample has flowed through a resin and has had carbon dioxide removed by a degassing process
Generally, degas conductivity is measured from [[Condensation|condensed]] and cooled samples of primary steam.  It may also be relevant for analyzing condensate return, especially in cases where the condensate is returned from a separate plant that used the steam in another process.

== Methodology ==
[[File:CO2 versus pH.tif|thumb|268x268px]]
After the [[ion]]s have been removed from the conditioning of the circulating water (e.g. ammonium NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in the [[Ion exchange|cation exchanger]], ions resulting from gaseous components must be removed in order to determine degas conductivity. These are typically gases from the atmosphere which have penetrated into the system through leaks in the water-steam circuit. Of all gases occurring in the atmosphere, typically only [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) dissolves chemically into ions in circulating water. The remaining gases ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], etc.) dissolve physically and do not form ions, and thus do not contribute to conductivity. The [[chemical reaction]]s of carbon dioxide in water proceed according to the following reaction equation (mass action law):

A) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;--&gt; HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;            pK = 6.3

B) HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;--&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;                       pK = 10.3

See the graph showing relative CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  After the cation exchanger, the sample [[pH value]] is generally between 5.5-6, so that means almost only CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is present as gas, and only about 6% is carbon carbonate ion CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[bicarbonate]] ion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is practically absent.

However, ionic components of carbon dioxide are far less dangerous to corrosion than the ions of the saline components, e.g. Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. In order to obtain a selective conductivity value for these saline-containing ions (with the maximum potential for corrosion), all remaining carbon dioxide must be removed from the sample in order to accurately determine the presence of corrosive ions.  
[[File:Degassing Curve.tif|thumb|244x244px]]
There are generally two methods for removing carbon dioxide from the water sample: use of a [[reboiler]] to heat the sample and expel the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and use of inert gasses.  In the latter method, an inert gas which does not contain CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is passed through the sample water, whereby the gas components in the sample water are displaced by the gas components of the inert gas. Use of bottled inert gases can be problematic in some industrial applications.  Reboilers are very efficient degassing with results over 92%, but they typically require anywhere from 20–45 minutes to achieve useful results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/download/a8dc7eeb/a8dc7eeb-79a9-4375-a282-b8e6c8a634df/cationconductivitymonitoringforfasterstart_ups.pdf|title=CATION CONDUCTIVITY MONITORING FOR FASTER START-UPS  - A NEW  APPROACH|last=Turner|first=Randy|date=|website=|publisher=Swan Analytical|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Manufacturers of reboiler systems include Swan Analytical, Mettler Toledo, and Sentry Systems.

A new variation of the inert gas method (known as "Gronowski's dynamic method"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gronowski.com/html/analysentechnik.html|title=Analysentechnik|website=gronowski.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has recently been developed together with partner manufacturer Waltron, whereby the inert gas is generated in the decarbonation column by passing air through a column filled with [[soda lime]].  The removal of the carbon dioxide is carried out in an exchanger column according to the contraflow principle.  The inert gas drives the carbon dioxide from the sample water so that no carbonate ion can be formed.  What remains in the water sample are salt-like (acid-like) ions and organic components, as well as oxygen and nitrogen which do not form ions in aqueous media.  Gronowski's dynamic method is extremely fast, achieving approximately 94% degassing in 45 seconds, growing up to even greater final efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waltron.net/_assets/Waltron%20media/Waltron%20Sales%20Sheet_Degassed%20Acid%20Conductivity%209096.pdf|title=9096 Degassed Acid Conductivity|last=|first=|date=|website=waltron.net|publisher=Waltron Bull &amp; Roberts, LLC|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  See the graph (right), taken from actual test data.

== Reasons for Measuring a Degassed Sample of Condensed Steam ==
Growth in renewable (but unsteady) energy sources has placed greater burden on modern gas-fired electric plants to cycle on and off to maintain steady and reliable electric production between Renewables and [[Base load|Base Load]].  These plants utilize a combination of gas (70%) and steam (30%) [[turbines]] to produce electricity.  Critical for top efficiency is ensuring pure steam reaches the second stage quickly.

During the start up of a [[power plant]], the purity of the generated steam determines whether it can be sent to the steam turbine or if it has to be bypassed to the condenser.  Traditionally “Cation Conductivity” instruments are used to analyze steam quality, but in addition to measuring harmful ionic compounds (e.g. chloride ions), they also include CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which as stated above is not significantly harmful to the steam turbine.  Furthermore, typical cation conductivity analyzers take 3–4 hours to provide useful indications of steam purity.  In many cases, this means the plant never reaches 100% efficiency before it cycles offline.  That means a gas-turbine combined cycle plant would be burning [[fuel]] at 100%, but only achieving a 70% output and venting the excess heat and exhaust.
[[File:CC Savings per Start.tif|thumb|262x262px|Compared savings from dynamic degassing over reboiler degassing.]]
In the case of a traditional base load power plant, cycling is much less frequent—in some cases, only twice annually for maintenance.  Compared with measuring only cation conductivity, the cost savings from an accelerated start-up using degas conductivity is potentially very large.  At $0.50/MW-minute ($30/MWH), a 750MW coal plant starting three hours faster each cycle will generate an additional $133,875 of annual revenue from the same fuel.

Based on similar assumptions, the cost savings between different degassing methodologies is significant.  If a dynamic system similar to Gronowski's is used, in the nearly 30 minutes of start-up time saved over a reboiler method, the typical combined cycle plant will generate even more income from the same fuel consumed with each and every system start, especially using typical “peak” electricity pricing.  Additional benefits are better energy efficiency and reduced emissions of heat and exhaust.

A coin weighing one drachma is known as a [[stater]], drachm, or drachma. The Ottoman [[dirhem]] was based on the [[Sassanian]] drachm, which was itself based on the Roman dram/drachm.

==British unit of mass==
The British [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)|Weights and Measures Act]] of 1878 introduced verification and consequent stamping of apothecary weights, making them officially recognized units of measurement. By 1900, Britain had enforced the distinction between the avoirdupois and apothecaries' versions by making the spelling different:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apothecaries Weights |url=http://www.apothecariesweights.com/|accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*dram now meant only avoirdupois drams, which were {{frac|16}} of an avoirdupois ounce of 437.5 [[grain (unit)|grain]]s, thus equal to 27.34 grains
*drachm now meant only apothecaries' drachms, which were {{frac|8}} of an apothecaries' ounce of 480 grains, thus equal to 60 grains

An '''electrolaser''' is a type of [[electroshock weapon]] that is also a [[directed-energy weapon]]. It uses [[laser]]s to form an electrically conductive ''laser-induced plasma channel'' (LIPC). A fraction of a second later, a powerful electric current is sent down this [[plasma channel]] and delivered to the target, thus functioning overall as a large-scale, high energy, long-distance version of the [[Taser]] [[electroshock gun]].

[[Alternating current]] is sent through a series of step-up [[transformer]]s, increasing the [[voltage]] and decreasing the [[electric current|current]]. The final voltage may be between 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; volts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} This current is fed into the plasma channel created by the laser beam.

==Laser-induced plasma channel==
A ''laser-induced [[plasma channel]]'' (LIPC) is formed by the following process:
* A [[laser]] emits a laser beam into the air.
* The laser beam rapidly heats and ionizes surrounding gases to form [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].
* The plasma forms an electrically conductive [[plasma channel]].

Because a laser-induced plasma channel relies on ionization, gas must exist between the electrolaser weapon and its target. If a laser-beam is intense enough, its electromagnetic field is strong enough to rip electrons off of air molecules, or whatever gas happens to be in between, creating [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18630622&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to lightning, the rapid heating also creates a sonic boom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Uses==
Methods of use:
*To kill or incapacitate a living target through [[electric shock]].
*To seriously damage, disable, or destroy any [[electric]] or [[electronics|electronic]] devices in the target.
*As electrolasers and natural [[lightning]] both use [[plasma channel]]s to conduct electric current, an electrolaser can set up a light-induced plasma channel for uses such as:
** To study [[lightning]]
** During a [[thunderstorm]], to make lightning discharge at a safe time and place, as with a [[lightning conductor]].&lt;ref name=laserfilament1/&gt;
** [[Harvesting lightning energy|Directing atmospheric lightning to a terrestrial collection station for the purpose of electrical power generation]]. 
** As a weapon, to make a [[thunderhead (cloud)|thunderhead]] deliver a precise lightning strike onto a target from an aircraft; in this case, the aircraft and laser can be compared to a [[triggered spark gap]], in that the relatively minor amount of initial input from the laser allows a large amount of energy to flow between the cloud and the ground.
Because of the [[plasma channel]], an electrolaser may cause an accident if there is a [[thunderstorm]] (or other electricity sources such as overhead powerlines) about.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} (''See'' [[Taser]] ''for more information &amp;ndash; principles of operation, controversies, etc''.)

An electrolaser is not presently practical for [[wireless energy transfer]] due to danger and low efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Examples of electrolasers==

===Applied Energetics/Ionatron===
Publicly traded company [[Applied Energetics]] (formerly Ionatron) develops [[directed-energy weapons]] for the [[United States]] [[military]]. The company has produced a device called the Joint IED Neutralizer (JIN) which was deemed unfit for field use in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schachtman | first=Noah | date=2006-05-21 | accessdate=2007-11-10 | url=http://www.noahshachtman.com/archives/002170.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003053841/http://www.noahshachtman.com/archives/002170.html | archivedate=3 October 2011| title=Real-Life Ray Gun: Say When?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JIN is intended for safely detonating [[improvised explosive devices]] (IEDs). Future designs include weapons mounted on land, air and sea vehicles and as a hand-held infantry version.

Applied Energetics said that the weapons will be able to be used as a non-lethal alternative to current weaponry, but will be able to deliver a high enough voltage jolt to kill.

[[Applied Energetics]]/Ionatron say that they are working on an electrolaser system, called LGE (Laser Guided Energy).{{Citation needed|reason=Previous citation was a bogus link to Amazon|date=February 2017}} They are also studying a laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC) as a way to stop people from going through a corridor or passageway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense-update.com/products/l/LPIC.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phoenix===
There was an unconfirmed report that in 1985 the [[U.S. Navy]] tested an electrolaser.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Its targets were missiles and aircraft. This device was known as the Phoenix project within the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] research program. It was first proved by experiment at long range in 1985, but this report may have referred to an early test of [[MIRACL]], which is or was a high-powered [[chemical laser]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===HSV Technologies===
HSV Technologies, Inc. (Stood for the last names of the original founders, Herr, Schlesinger and Vernon; this is NOT the same company as Holden Special Vehicles), formerly of [[San Diego, California]], USA, then Port Orchard, WA, designed a non-lethal device which was profiled in the 2002 ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine article "Beyond the Rubber Bullet". It is an electrolaser using [[ultraviolet]] [[laser]] beams of 193&amp;nbsp;nm, and promises to immobilize living targets at a distance without contact. There is plan for an engine-disabling variation for use against the electronic ignitions of cars using a 248&amp;nbsp;nm laser. The lead inventor, Eric Herr, died in 2008 and the company appears to have been dissolved, as their website now hosts an unrelated business (as of 9/2015) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsvti.com HSV Technologies official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Picatinny Arsenal===
Scientists and engineers from [[Picatinny Arsenal]] have demonstrated that an electric discharge can go through a laser beam. The laser beam is self-focusing due to the high laser intensity of 50 gigawatts, which changes the [[Speed of light#In a medium|speed of light]] in air.&lt;ref&gt;Kaneshiro, Jason. [http://www.army.mil/article/82262/ "Picatinny engineers set phasers to 'fry'"] ''[[Picatinny Arsenal]]'', 21 June 2012. Retrieved: 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The laser was reportedly successfully tested in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18630622 BBC news-Lightning Laser Weapon Developed by US Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environment Victoria''', formerly the '''Conservation Council of Victoria''', is an [[Australia]]n not-for-profit, charitable group and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s peak non-government environment organisation. It works in collaboration with over 150 groups Australia-wide to protect Victoria’s environment and relies on financial support from donors, members, grants and sponsorships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreendirectory.com.au/green-business/environment/not-for-profit-organisations/environment-victoria/details.html The Green Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The group was originally formed in 1969 as the Conservation Council of Victoria as a result of a successful campaign to save the [[Little Desert National Park]] from subdivision. In 1994, the organisation changed name to Environment Victoria to reflect the broader range of issues it now deals with.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521450768 Hutton, Drew and Connors, Libby: ''History of the Australian Environment Movement''], 1999 Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-45076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1971 until 1997, two representatives of the Conservation Council of Victoria served on the Land Conservation Council which was responsible for systematically investigating and recommending balanced use of public land across the state. [[John Landy]] (later Governor of Victoria) and professor of botany John Turner were the first representatives.  Joan Lindros, [[Bill Holsworth]] and Malcolm Calder were also long serving representatives.

==Successes==

Environment Victoria list the Walk Against Warming, the successful campaign to put a price on pollution in Australia and the federal government's decision to withdraw funding from HRL's proposed coal-fired power station in 2012 among their successes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentvictoria.org.au/our-successes]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3472">[[File:Voltage regulator foldback.svg|thumb|V-I curves for voltage regulators with different overload handling: &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;foldback&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;constant current limited&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;unlimited&lt;/span&gt;.]]

'''Foldback''' is a [[current limiting]] feature (a type of [[overload protection]]) of [[power supplies]] and [[power amplifier]]s. When the load attempts to draw overcurrent from the supply, foldback reduces both the output [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] to well below the normal operating limits. Under a [[short circuit]], where the output voltage has reduced to zero, the current is typically limited to a small fraction of the maximum current.

[[File:Voltage regulator linear foldback.svg|thumb|Power dissipation vs. load resistance for linear voltage regulators with different overload handling. Here ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; = 12 V, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; = 10 V, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 A, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;=0.17 A. The maximum dissipation in the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;foldback&lt;/span&gt; design is three times lower than in the &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;constant current limited&lt;/span&gt; design.]]

The prime purpose of foldback current limiting in [[Linear power supply|linear power supplies]] is to keep the output [[transistor]] within its safe [[power dissipation]] limit.
With a linear voltage regulator, the output voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; and output current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; are maintained by simply dissipating away the surplus of input voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm dissipation\, in\, regulator} = (V_{\rm in} - V_{\rm out})\times I_{\rm out}&lt;/math&gt;
Under overload conditions the output voltage falls and so the difference ''V''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; - ''V''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; becomes larger, tending to increasing dissipation. For a simple current limit, safely handling the worst-case scenario (a short circuit) would therefore require a much larger heatsink and output transistor than would be required under normal operating conditions. Foldback partially solves this, helping to keep the normal-rated output transistor within its [[safe operating area]] under [[fault (power engineering)|fault]] and [[electrical overload|overload]] conditions. Foldback also significantly reduces the power dissipation in the ''load'' in fault conditions, which can reduce the risks of fire and heat damage.

Many power supplies employ [[constant current]] limiting protection; foldback goes one step further by reducing the output current limit linearly as output voltage decreases. However it adds complexity to the power supply and can trigger "lockout" conditions with non-[[Ohm's law|ohmic]] devices that draw a constant current independent of supply voltage (such as op-amps). Foldback in [[switched-mode power supplies]] is discouraged because of these disadvantages, and since the benefit of reducing the power dissipation does not apply. Despite this, foldback is still often implemented in them.&lt;ref&gt;

Gelclair can be used in the management of the painful symptoms of oral [[mucositis]] usually caused by [[radiotherapy]] or [[chemotherapy]] treatment for [[cancer]] but can also be caused by medication, disease, oral surgery, stress, traumatic ulcers caused by dental braces and dentures and ageing.  
Gelclair can be used by patients of all ages.
Gelclair is usually used 3 times a day or as needed.  It is usually diluted with water and rinsed around the mouth.  It can be used undiluted where no water is available, applied directly.
Gelclair does not numb the mouth and can be used in conjunction with other treatment options for managing oral mucositis, including antibacterial mouthwashes and painkillers.

==Clinical evidence==

Innocenti et al.&lt;ref&gt;Innocenti, M, Moscatelli, G, Lopez, S. "Efficacy of Gelclair in Reducing Pain in Patients with Oral Lesions - Preliminary Findings From an Open Pilot Study". Journal of Pain and Symptom Management 2002; 24(5): 456-457&lt;/ref&gt; studied Gelclair in a total of thirty patients with chemotherapy-induced oral lesions.  Results showed a 92% reduction in mean pain scores 5–7 hours after the first administration of Gelclair.  Patients were also given Gelclair for a further 7–10 days and at the end of this period, pain scores were recorded.  After one week of using Gelclair, 87% of patients reported overall improvements relating to pain on swallowing food, liquids and saliva.

De Cordi et al.&lt;ref&gt;De Cordi, D, Martina, S. "Gelclair: potentially an efficacious treatment for chemotherapy-induced mucositis". Presented at the Italian Tumour League III congress for professional oncology nurses, Conegliano, Italy, 10–12 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; studied thirty patients with lesions of the mouth and oropharynx (caused by various diseases).  83% of patients reported a reduction in pain, 13% remained the same and 3% showed initial improvement but then got worse.  83% showed a distinct improvement in functionality in the ability to take food, 7% remained the same, and 7% got worse, while 3% reported considerable improvement followed by slight worsening.  57% of patients reported an improvement in the grade of oral mucositis, 40% remained the same while 3% got worse.

Berndtson&lt;ref&gt;Berndtson, M. "A Preliminary Study of Orassist (Gelclair) in the management of Oral Mucositis". This paper was published in Svensk Sjukhustandlakartidning (Swedish Hospital Dentistry) 2001 Nr 3 (Argang 26) pp17-21.
&lt;/ref&gt; studied ten patients who were given Gelclair to evaluate its effect on their symptoms of oral mucositis.  All reported that the product was acceptable for its taste and consistency, and a palliative soothing effect was noted.

==Interactions with other medicines==

Gelclair has no known interactions with medicines or other products and has no known toxicity.

'''Greaseproof paper''' is [[paper]] that is impermeable to [[oil]] or [[Fat|grease]] and is normally used in cooking or food packaging.  Normally greaseproof paper is produced by refining the paper stock and thus create a sheet with very low porosity. This sheet is [[supercalendered]] to further improve the density, creating a paper called [[glassine]]. The glassine is treated with [[starch]]es, [[alginate]]s or [[carboxymethyl cellulose]] (CMC) in a [[sizing|size press]] to fill pores or treat the paper chemically to make it fat repellent. [[Grammage|Basis weights]] are usually 30–50 g/m².&lt;ref name=GP&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu  |title=Paper and Board grades |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18  |year= 2000 |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland   |page= 123  |chapter=5|isbn= 952-5216-18-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, Greaseproof paper is also referred to as SKAN Greaseproof.

The '''Guandi Dam''' ({{zh|s=官地大坝|t=官地大壩|p=Guāndì Dàbà}}) is a [[gravity dam]] on the [[Yalong River]], a tributary of the [[Yangtze River]] in [[Sichuan Province]] Southwest of [[China]]. It supplies water to four [[hydroelectric]] generators, each with generating capacity of 600 MW. The total generating capacity of the project is 2,400 MW. Construction started on October 20, 2010 with a ground-breaking ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guandi and Tongzilin hydropower stations at Yalong River start construction|url=http://www.sdic.com.cn/en/InromationCenter/photonews/webinfo/2010/10/26/1288058400505152.htm|publisher=State Development and Investment Corps|accessdate=8 January 2011|date=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guandi Hydroelectric Project|url=http://www.ehdc.com.cn/newsite/en/gd.aspx|publisher=Ertan Hydropower Development Company|accessdate=8 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111123553/http://www.ehdc.com.cn/newsite/en/gd.aspx|archivedate=11 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2012 the dam began to impound the reservoir and the last of the four generators were commissioned on 28 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydropower construction Parade Crown land.

'''''Hauling''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] on poor families who work as recyclers in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

==Plot==
The recycling underworld of Sao Paulo, Brazil is the background to this documentary centering on Claudieni, father to 27 children. In his green VW bus, he visits the Santa Efigenia neighborhood of Sao Paulo to recycle plastic, cardboard, and computers and other electronic equipment. He and his family represent the lower class of people who are discriminated against by other strata of society.

The film will have its U.S. West Coast premiere at the [[San Francisco Green Film Festival]] in March 2011.{{Update after|2011|04|01}}

{{refimprove|date=April 2016}}
{{expert subject|1=Physics|date=April 2016}}
The '''Hopkinson effect''' is a feature of [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] materials, in which an increase in [[magnetic susceptibility]] is observed at temperatures between the [[Superparamagnetism#Blocking_temperature|blocking temperature]] and the [[Curie temperature]] of the material.  The Hopkinson effect can be observed as a peak in thermomagnetic curves that immediately precedes the susceptibility drop associated with the Curie temperature. It was first observed by [[John Hopkinson]] in 1889 in a study on iron.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkinson, John. “Magnetic and Other Physical Properties of Iron at a High Temperature”. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A 180 (1889): 443–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

In single domain particles, a large Hopkinson peak results from a transient [[Superparamagnetism|superparamagnetic]] particle domain state.

[[File:ConventPlasmaInductors W.tif|thumb|Fig. 3. Conventional Plasma Inductors]]

In planar geometry, the electrode is a length of flat metal wound like a spiral (or coil). In cylindrical geometry, it is like a [[helix|helical]] spring. In half-toroidal geometry, it is [[toroid]]al [[solenoid]] cut along its main diameter to two equal halves.

When a time-varying electric current is passed through the coil, it creates a time-varying magnetic field around it, with flux

&lt;math&gt;\Phi=\pi r^2 H=\pi r^2 H_0 \cos \omega t&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''r'' is the distance to the center of coil (and of the quartz tube).

According to the [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday–Lenz's law of induction]], this creates [[azimuthal]] [[electromotive force]] in the [[Rarefaction|rarefied]] gas:

&lt;math&gt;U=-\frac{d \Phi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;,

which corresponds to electric field strengths of

&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{U}{2 \pi r}=\frac{\omega r H_0}{2} \sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Бабушкин|first1=А. А.|last2=Бажулин|first2=П. А.|last3=Королёв|first3=Ф.

leading to the formation of the figure-8 electron trajectories&lt;ref name="ShunkoStevenson2014" /&gt; providing a plasma generation. The dependence on r suggests that the gas ion motion is most intense in the outer region of the flame, where the temperature is the greatest. In the real torch, the flame is cooled from the outside by the cooling gas, so the hottest outer part is at thermal equilibrium. There temperature reaches 5 000–6 000 K.&lt;ref name="Dunnivant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunnivant|first1=F. M.|last2=Ginsbach|first2=J.

The frequency of alternating current used in the [[RLC circuit]] which contains the coil usually 27–41 MHz. To induce plasma, a spark is produced at the electrodes at the gas outlet. Argon is one example of a commonly used rarefied gas. The high temperature of the plasma allows the determination of many elements, and in addition, for about 60 elements degree of ionization in the torch exceeds 90 %. The ICP torch consumes ca. 1250–1550 W of power, but this depends on the elemental composition of the sample (due to different [[Ionization energies of the elements|ionization energies]]).&lt;ref name="Dunnivant" /&gt;

Plasma [[electron temperature]]s can range between ~6 000 K and ~10 000 K (~6 eV - ~100 eV),&lt;ref name="ShunkoStevenson2014" /&gt; comparable to the surface of the sun. ICP discharges are of relatively high electron density, on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, ICP discharges have wide applications where a high-density plasma (HDP) is needed.

Another benefit of ICP discharges is that they are relatively free of contamination, because the electrodes are completely outside the reaction chamber. By contrast, in a [[capacitively coupled plasma]] (CCP), the electrodes are often placed inside the reactor and are thus exposed to the plasma and subsequent reactive chemical species.

In [[continuum mechanics]], the '''infinitesimal strain theory''' is a mathematical approach to the  description of the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a solid body in which the [[Displacement (vector)|displacements]] of the material [[particle]]s are assumed to be much smaller (indeed, [[infinitesimally]] smaller) than any relevant dimension of the body; so that its geometry and the constitutive properties of the material (such as [[density]] and [[stiffness]]) at each point of space can be assumed to be unchanged by the deformation.

With this assumption, the equations of continuum mechanics are considerably simplified.  This approach may also be called '''small deformation theory''', '''small displacement theory''', or '''small displacement-gradient theory'''.  It is contrasted with the [[finite strain theory]] where the opposite assumption is made.

The infinitesimal strain theory is commonly adopted in civil and mechanical engineering for the [[stress analysis]] of structures built from relatively stiff [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] materials like [[concrete]] and [[steel]], since a common goal in the design of such structures is to minimize their deformation under typical [[Structural load|loads]].

==Infinitesimal strain tensor==

For ''infinitesimal deformations'' of a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum body]], in which the displacement (vector) and the [[Deformation (mechanics)#Displacement|displacement gradient]] (2nd order tensor) are small compared to unity, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf u\| \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=The textbook of Slaughter (2002) -see note for the reference- does not report the first condition &lt;math&gt;\|\mathbf u\| \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt; as a necessary condition; why it is necessary? Please provide a reference or an explanation.|date=August 2018}} and &lt;math&gt;\|\nabla \mathbf u\| \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt;, 
it is possible to perform a ''geometric linearization'' of any one of the (infinitely many possible) strain tensors used in finite strain theory, e.g. the Lagrangian strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf E&lt;/math&gt;, and the Eulerian strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e&lt;/math&gt;.  In such a linearization, the non-linear or second-order terms of the finite strain tensor are neglected. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E =\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\right)\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T\right)&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;E_{KL}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial U_K}{\partial X_L}+\frac{\partial U_L}{\partial X_K}+\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_L}\right)\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial U_K}{\partial X_L}+\frac{\partial U_L}{\partial X_K}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e =\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u)^T - \nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u(\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u)^T\right)\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf u)^T\right)&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;e_{rs}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial x_s} +\frac{\partial u_s}{\partial x_r}-\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_s}\right)\approx \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial x_s} +\frac{\partial u_s}{\partial x_r}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This linearization implies that the Lagrangian description and the Eulerian description are approximately the same as there is little difference in the material and spatial coordinates of a given material point in the continuum. Therefore, the material displacement gradient components and the spatial displacement gradient components are approximately equal. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E \approx \mathbf e \approx \boldsymbol \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left((\nabla\mathbf u)^T + \nabla\mathbf u\right) \qquad &lt;/math&gt;
or
&lt;math&gt;\qquad E_{KL}\approx e_{rs}\approx\varepsilon_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the ''infinitesimal strain tensor'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, also called ''Cauchy's strain tensor'', ''linear strain tensor'', or ''small strain tensor''.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\varepsilon_{ij} &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\left(u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}\right)  \\
&amp;=
\left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
   \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
   \varepsilon_{31} &amp; \varepsilon_{32} &amp; \varepsilon_{33} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] \\
&amp;=
\left[\begin{matrix}
  \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_2}+\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_1}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3}+\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_1}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_1}+\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_2}\right) &amp; \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3}+\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_2}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_1}+\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_3}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_2}+\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_3}\right) &amp; \frac{\partial u_3}{\partial x_3} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

or using different notation:
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \varepsilon_{xy} &amp; \varepsilon_{xz} \\
   \varepsilon_{yx} &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \varepsilon_{yz} \\
   \varepsilon_{zx} &amp; \varepsilon_{zy} &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right]
=
\left[\begin{matrix}
  \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}+\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\right) &amp; \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z}+\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y}\right) \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}\right) &amp; \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z}\right) &amp; \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, since the [[deformation gradient]] can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} + \boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt; is the second-order identity tensor, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{F}^T+\boldsymbol{F}\right)-\boldsymbol{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, from the [[Finite_strain_theory#Seth-Hill_family_of_generalized_strain_tensors|general expression]] for the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors we have

:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{align}
\mathbf E_{(m)}&amp; =\frac{1}{2m}(\mathbf U^{2m}-\boldsymbol{I}) = \frac{1}{2m}[(\boldsymbol{F}^T\boldsymbol{F})^m - \boldsymbol{I}] \approx \frac{1}{2m}[\{\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u}+(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^T + \boldsymbol{I}\}^m - \boldsymbol{I}]\approx \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\\
\mathbf e_{(m)}&amp; =\frac{1}{2m}(\mathbf V^{2m}-\boldsymbol{I})= \frac{1}{2m}[(\boldsymbol{F}\boldsymbol{F}^T)^m - \boldsymbol{I}]\approx \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
 \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Geometric derivation of the infinitesimal strain tensor==
[[Image:2D geometric strain.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 1. Two-dimensional geometric deformation of an infinitesimal material element.]]
Consider a two-dimensional deformation of an infinitesimal rectangular material element with dimensions &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;dy&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 1), which after deformation, takes the form of a rhombus. From the geometry of Figure 1 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\overline {ab} &amp;= \sqrt{\left(dx+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}dx \right)^2} \\
&amp;= dx\sqrt{1+2\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}+\left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}\right)^2} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For very small displacement gradients, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\|\nabla \mathbf u\| \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\overline {ab} \approx dx +\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Deformation (mechanics)#Strain measures|normal strain]] in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-direction of the rectangular element is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_x = \frac{\overline {ab}-\overline {AB}}{\overline {AB}}&lt;/math&gt;
and knowing that &lt;math&gt;\overline {AB}= dx&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_x = \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the normal strain in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-direction, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-direction, becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_y = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} \quad , \qquad  \varepsilon_z = \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Deformation (mechanics)#Strain measures|engineering shear strain]], or the change in angle between two originally orthogonal material lines, in this case line &lt;math&gt;\overline {AC}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline {AB}&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}= \alpha + \beta&lt;/math&gt;

From the geometry of Figure 1 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha=\frac{\dfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}dx}{dx+\dfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}dx}=\frac{\dfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}}{1+\dfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}} \quad , \qquad \tan \beta=\frac{\dfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}dy}{dy+\dfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}dy}=\frac{\dfrac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}}{1+\dfrac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}}&lt;/math&gt;

For small rotations, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\ll 1&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha \approx \alpha \quad , \qquad \tan \beta \approx \beta&lt;/math&gt;

and, again, for small displacement gradients, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} \quad , \qquad \beta=\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;

thus

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}= \alpha + \beta = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}&lt;/math&gt;
By interchanging &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_y&lt;/math&gt;, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy} = \gamma_{yx}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; planes, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{yz}=\gamma_{zy} = \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y} \quad , \qquad \gamma_{zx}=\gamma_{xz}= \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that the tensorial shear strain components of the infinitesimal strain tensor can then be expressed using the engineering strain definition, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, as

&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \varepsilon_{xy} &amp; \varepsilon_{xz} \\
   \varepsilon_{yx} &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \varepsilon_{yz} \\
   \varepsilon_{zx} &amp; \varepsilon_{zy} &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right] = \left[\begin{matrix}
\varepsilon_{xx} &amp; \gamma_{xy}/2 &amp; \gamma_{xz}/2 \\
   \gamma_{yx}/2 &amp; \varepsilon_{yy} &amp; \gamma_{yz}/2 \\
   \gamma_{zx}/2 &amp; \gamma_{zy}/2 &amp; \varepsilon_{zz} \\
  \end{matrix}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

===Physical interpretation of the infinitesimal strain tensor===
From [[Finite deformation tensor|finite strain theory]] we have

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2 = d\mathbf X \cdot 2\mathbf E \cdot d\mathbf X \quad\text{or}\quad (dx)^2 - (dX)^2 = 2E_{KL}\,dX_K\,dX_L&lt;/math&gt;

For infinitesimal strains then we have

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2 = d\mathbf X \cdot 2\mathbf{\boldsymbol \varepsilon} \cdot d\mathbf X \quad\text{or}\quad (dx)^2 - (dX)^2 = 2\varepsilon_{KL}\,dX_K\,dX_L&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by &lt;math&gt;(dX)^2&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx-dX}{dX}\frac{dx+dX}{dX}=2\varepsilon_{ij}\frac{dX_i}{dX}\frac{dX_j}{dX}&lt;/math&gt;

For small deformations we assume that &lt;math&gt;dx \approx dX&lt;/math&gt;, thus the second term of the left hand side becomes: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx+dX}{dX} \approx 2&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx-dX}{dX}=\varepsilon_{ij}N_iN_j = \mathbf N \cdot \boldsymbol \varepsilon \cdot \mathbf N&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_i=\frac{dX_i}{dX}&lt;/math&gt;, is the unit vector in the direction of &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X&lt;/math&gt;, and the left-hand-side expression is the [[Deformation (mechanics)#Strain measures|normal strain]] &lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf N)}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N&lt;/math&gt;. For the particular case of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; direction, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N=\mathbf I_1&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf I_1)}=\mathbf I_1 \cdot \boldsymbol \varepsilon \cdot \mathbf I_1=\varepsilon_{11}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N=\mathbf I_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N=\mathbf I_3&lt;/math&gt; we can find the normal strains &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{22}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{33}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Therefore, the diagonal elements of the infinitesimal strain tensor are the normal strains in the coordinate directions.

=== Strain transformation rules ===
If we choose an [[orthonormal basis|orthonormal coordinate system]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2,\mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt;) we can write the tensor in terms of components with respect to those base vectors as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \varepsilon_{ij} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j
 &lt;/math&gt;
In matrix form,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
     \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
     \varepsilon_{13} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} &amp; \varepsilon_{33} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can easily choose to use another orthonormal coordinate system (&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1,\hat{\mathbf{e}}_2,\hat{\mathbf{e}}_3&lt;/math&gt;) instead.  In that case the components of the tensor are different, say
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \sum_{j=1}^3 \hat{\varepsilon}_{ij} \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i\otimes\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j \quad \implies \quad \underline{\underline{\hat{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}}} = \begin{bmatrix} \hat{\varepsilon}_{11} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{12} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{13} \\
     \hat{\varepsilon}_{12} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{22} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{23} \\
     \hat{\varepsilon}_{13} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{23} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{33} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components of the strain in the two coordinate systems are related by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \hat{\varepsilon}_{ij} = \ell_{ip}~\ell_{jq}~\varepsilon_{pq}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Einstein summation convention]] for repeated indices has been used and &lt;math&gt;\ell_{ij} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;.  In matrix form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\hat{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}}} = \underline{\underline{\mathbf{L}}} ~\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}}~ \underline{\underline{\mathbf{L}}}^T
 &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{bmatrix} \hat{\varepsilon}_{11} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{12} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{13} \\
     \hat{\varepsilon}_{21} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{22} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{23} \\
     \hat{\varepsilon}_{31} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{32} &amp; \hat{\varepsilon}_{33} \end{bmatrix}
   = \begin{bmatrix} \ell_{11} &amp; \ell_{12} &amp; \ell_{13} \\ \ell_{21} &amp; \ell_{22} &amp; \ell_{23} \\ \ell_{31} &amp; \ell_{32} &amp; \ell_{33} \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
     \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
     \varepsilon_{31} &amp; \varepsilon_{32} &amp; \varepsilon_{33} \end{bmatrix}
     \begin{bmatrix} \ell_{11} &amp; \ell_{12} &amp; \ell_{13} \\ \ell_{21} &amp; \ell_{22} &amp; \ell_{23} \\ \ell_{31} &amp; \ell_{32} &amp; \ell_{33} \end{bmatrix}^T
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Strain invariants ===
Certain operations on the strain tensor give the same result without regard to which orthonormal coordinate system is used to represent the components of strain.  The results of these operations are called '''strain invariants'''.  The most commonly used strain invariants are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   I_1 &amp; = \mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}) \\
   I_2 &amp; = \tfrac{1}{2}\{\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^2) - [\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})]^2\} \\
   I_3 &amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
In terms of components
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   I_1 &amp; = \varepsilon_{11} + \varepsilon_{22} + \varepsilon_{33} \\
   I_2 &amp; = \varepsilon_{12}^2 + \varepsilon_{23}^2 + \varepsilon_{31}^2 - \varepsilon_{11}\varepsilon_{22} - \varepsilon_{22}\varepsilon_{33} - \varepsilon_{33}\varepsilon_{11} \\
   I_3 &amp; = \varepsilon_{11}(\varepsilon_{22}\varepsilon_{33} - \varepsilon_{23}^2) - \varepsilon_{12}(\varepsilon_{11}\varepsilon_{33}-\varepsilon_{23}\varepsilon_{31}) + \varepsilon_{13}(\varepsilon_{21}\varepsilon_{32}-\varepsilon_{22}\varepsilon_{31})
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Principal strains===
It can be shown that it is possible to find a coordinate system (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_1,\mathbf{n}_2,\mathbf{n}_3&lt;/math&gt;) in which the components of the strain tensor are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; \varepsilon_{2} &amp; 0 \\
     0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_{3} \end{bmatrix} \quad \implies \quad \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \varepsilon_{1} \mathbf{n}_1\otimes\mathbf{n}_1 + \varepsilon_{2} \mathbf{n}_2\otimes\mathbf{n}_2 + \varepsilon_{3} \mathbf{n}_3\otimes\mathbf{n}_3 
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components of the strain tensor in the (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_1,\mathbf{n}_2,\mathbf{n}_3&lt;/math&gt;) coordinate system are called the '''principal strains''' and the directions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the directions of principal strain.  Since there are no shear strain components in this coordinate system, the principal strains represent the maximum and minimum stretches of an elemental volume.

If we are given the components of the strain tensor in an arbitrary orthonormal coordinate system, we can find the principal strains using an [[eigenvalue decomposition]] determined by solving the system of equations
:&lt;math&gt;
   (\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} - \varepsilon_i~\underline{\underline{\mathbf{I}}})~\mathbf{n}_i = \underline{\mathbf{0}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
This system of equations is equivalent to finding the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i&lt;/math&gt; along which the strain tensor becomes a pure stretch with no shear component.

===Volumetric strain{{anchor|Volumetric strain}}=== &lt;!-- anchor: [[Volumetric strain]] redirects here --&gt;
The ''dilatation'' (the relative variation of the volume) is the [[trace (matrix)|trace]] of the tensor:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = \varepsilon_{11} + \varepsilon_{22} + \varepsilon_{33}&lt;/math&gt;
Actually, if we consider a cube with an edge length ''a'', it is a quasi-cube after the deformation (the variations of the angles do not change the volume) with the dimensions &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (1 + \varepsilon_{11}) \times a \cdot (1 + \varepsilon_{22}) \times a \cdot (1 + \varepsilon_{33})&lt;/math&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, thus
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = \frac{\left ( 1 + \varepsilon_{11} + \varepsilon_{22} + \varepsilon_{33} + \varepsilon_{11} \cdot \varepsilon_{22} + \varepsilon_{11} \cdot \varepsilon_{33}+ \varepsilon_{22} \cdot \varepsilon_{33} + \varepsilon_{11} \cdot \varepsilon_{22} \cdot \varepsilon_{33} \right ) \cdot a^3 - a^3}{a^3}&lt;/math&gt;
as we consider small deformations,
:&lt;math&gt;1 \gg \varepsilon_{ii} \gg \varepsilon_{ii} \cdot \varepsilon_{jj} \gg \varepsilon_{11} \cdot \varepsilon_{22} \cdot \varepsilon_{33} &lt;/math&gt;
therefore the formula.

In case of pure shear, we can see that there is no change of the volume.

===Strain deviator tensor===
The infinitesimal strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, similarly to the [[Cauchy stress tensor]], can be expressed as the sum of two other tensors: 
# a '''mean strain tensor''' or '''volumetric strain tensor''' or '''spherical strain tensor''', &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_M\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, related to dilation or volume change; and
# a deviatoric component called the '''strain deviator tensor''', &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon'_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, related to distortion.

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}= \varepsilon'_{ij} + \varepsilon_M\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_M&lt;/math&gt; is the mean strain given by

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_M=\frac{\varepsilon_{kk}}{3}=\frac{\varepsilon_{11}+\varepsilon_{22}+\varepsilon_{33}}{3}=\tfrac{1}{3}I^e_1&lt;/math&gt;

The deviatoric strain tensor can be obtained by subtracting the mean strain tensor from the infinitesimal strain tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\ \varepsilon'_{ij} &amp;= \varepsilon_{ij} - \frac{\varepsilon_{kk}}{3}\delta_{ij} \\
 \left[{\begin{matrix}
   \varepsilon'_{11} &amp; \varepsilon'_{12} &amp; \varepsilon'_{13} \\
   \varepsilon'_{21} &amp; \varepsilon'_{22} &amp; \varepsilon'_{23} \\
   \varepsilon'_{31} &amp; \varepsilon'_{32} &amp; \varepsilon'_{33} \\
  \end{matrix}}\right]
&amp;=\left[{\begin{matrix}
   \varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
   \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
   \varepsilon_{31} &amp; \varepsilon_{32} &amp; \varepsilon_{33} \\
  \end{matrix}}\right]-\left[{\begin{matrix}
   \varepsilon_M &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; \varepsilon_M &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_M \\
  \end{matrix}}\right] \\
&amp;=\left[{\begin{matrix}
   \varepsilon_{11}-\varepsilon_M &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
   \varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22}-\varepsilon_M &amp; \varepsilon_{23} \\
   \varepsilon_{31} &amp; \varepsilon_{32} &amp; \varepsilon_{33}-\varepsilon_M \\
  \end{matrix}}\right] \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Octahedral strains===
Let (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_1, \mathbf{n}_2, \mathbf{n}_3&lt;/math&gt;) be the directions of the three principal strains.  An '''octahedral plane''' is one whose normal makes equal angles with the three principal directions.  The engineering [[shear strain]] on an octahedral plane is called the '''octahedral shear strain''' and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \gamma_{\mathrm{oct}} = \tfrac{2}{3}\sqrt{(\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_2)^2 + (\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_3)^2 + (\varepsilon_3-\varepsilon_1)^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2, \varepsilon_3&lt;/math&gt; are the principal strains.  {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[normal strain]] on an octahedral plane is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{\mathrm{oct}} = \tfrac{1}{3}(\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2 + \varepsilon_3)
 &lt;/math&gt;
{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Equivalent strain ===
A scalar quantity called the '''equivalent strain''', or the [[von Mises]] equivalent strain, is often used to describe the state of strain in solids.  Several definitions of equivalent strain can be found in the literature.  A definition that is commonly used in the literature on [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{\mathrm{eq}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}}:\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}}}  = \sqrt{\tfrac{2}{3}\varepsilon_{ij}^{\mathrm{dev}}\varepsilon_{ij}^{\mathrm{dev}}} 
  ~;~~ \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{dev}} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} - \tfrac{1}{3}\mathrm{tr}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon})~\boldsymbol{I} 
 &lt;/math&gt;
This quantity is work conjugate to the equivalent stress defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_{\mathrm{eq}} = \sqrt{\tfrac{3}{2} \boldsymbol{\sigma}^{\mathrm{dev}}:\boldsymbol{\sigma}^{\mathrm{dev}}}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==Compatibility equations==
{{Main|Compatibility (mechanics)}}
For prescribed strain components &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; the strain tensor equation &lt;math&gt;u_{i,j}+u_{j,i}= 2 \varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents a system of six differential equations for the determination of three displacements components &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt;, giving an over-determined system. Thus, a solution does not generally exist for an arbitrary choice of strain components. Therefore, some restrictions, named ''compatibility equations'', are imposed upon the strain components. With the addition of the three compatibility equations the number of independent equations are reduced to three, matching the number of unknown displacement components. These constraints on the strain tensor were discovered by [[Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant|Saint-Venant]], and are called the "[[Saint-Venant's compatibility condition|Saint Venant compatibility equations]]".

The compatibility functions serve to assure a single-valued continuous displacement function &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt;.  If the elastic medium is visualised as a set of infinitesimal cubes in the unstrained state, after the medium is strained, an arbitrary strain tensor may not yield a situation in which the distorted cubes still fit together without overlapping.

In index notation, the compatibility equations are expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij,km}+\varepsilon_{km,ij}-\varepsilon_{ik,jm}-\varepsilon_{jm,ik}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \epsilon_y}{\partial z^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \epsilon_z}{\partial y^2} = 2 \frac{\partial^2 \epsilon_{yz}}{\partial y \partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \epsilon_y}{\partial z \partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left ( \frac{\partial \epsilon_{yz}}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial \epsilon_{zx}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \epsilon_{xy}}{\partial z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \epsilon_z}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left ( \frac{\partial \epsilon_{yz}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \epsilon_{zx}}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial \epsilon_{xy}}{\partial z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Special cases ==

===Plane strain===
[[Image:Plane strain.svg|500px|right|thumb|Plane strain state in a continuum.]]
In real engineering components, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] (and strain) are 3-D [[tensor]]s but in prismatic structures such as a long metal billet, the length of the structure is much greater than the other two dimensions.   The strains associated with length, i.e., the normal strain &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{33}&lt;/math&gt; and the shear strains &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{13}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{23}&lt;/math&gt; (if the length is the 3-direction) are constrained by nearby material and are small compared to the ''cross-sectional strains''. Plane strain is then an acceptable approximation. The [[strain tensor]] for plane strain is written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; 0 \\
     0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

in which the double underline indicates a second order [[tensor]].   This strain state is called ''plane strain''.   The corresponding stress tensor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; 0 \\
     0      &amp;     0       &amp; \sigma_{33}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

in which the non-zero &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{33}&lt;/math&gt; is needed to maintain the constraint &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{33} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.   This stress term can be temporarily removed from the analysis to leave only the in-plane terms, effectively reducing the 3-D problem to a much simpler 2-D problem.

=== Antiplane strain ===
{{main|Antiplane shear}}
Antiplane strain is another special state of strain that can occur in a body, for instance in a region close to a [[screw dislocation]].  The [[strain tensor]] for antiplane strain is given by
: &lt;math&gt;\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_{13} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \varepsilon_{23}\\
 \varepsilon_{13}    &amp;    \varepsilon_{23}      &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Infinitesimal rotation tensor ==
The infinitesimal strain tensor is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2} [\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} + (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^T]
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore the displacement gradient can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} + \boldsymbol{\omega}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\omega} := \frac{1}{2} [\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} - (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u})^T]
&lt;/math&gt;
The quantity &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is the '''infinitesimal rotation tensor'''.  This tensor is [[skew symmetric]]. For infinitesimal deformations the scalar components of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the condition &lt;math&gt;|\omega_{ij}| \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the displacement gradient is small only if '''both''' the strain tensor and the rotation tensor are infinitesimal.

=== The axial vector ===
A skew symmetric second-order tensor has three independent scalar components.  These three components are used to define an '''axial vector''', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;, as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
   \omega_{ij} = -\epsilon_{ijk}~w_k ~;~~ w_i = -\tfrac{1}{2}~\epsilon_{ijk}~\omega_{jk}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]].  In matrix form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{\omega}}} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -w_3 &amp; w_2 \\ w_3 &amp; 0 &amp; -w_1 \\ -w_2 &amp; w_1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} ~;~~ \underline{\mathbf{w}} = \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ w_3 \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The axial vector is also called the '''infinitesimal rotation vector'''.  The rotation vector is related to the displacement gradient by the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{w} = \tfrac{1}{2}~\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\mathbf{u}
 &lt;/math&gt;
In index notation
:&lt;math&gt;
   w_i = \tfrac{1}{2}~\epsilon_{ijk}~u_{k,j}
 &lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;\lVert\boldsymbol{\omega}\rVert \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt; then the material undergoes an approximate rigid body rotation of magnitude &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{w}|&lt;/math&gt; around the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Relation between the strain tensor and the rotation vector ===
Given a continuous, single-valued displacement field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding infinitesimal strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;, we have (see [[Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics)]])
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = e_{ijk}~\varepsilon_{lj,i}~\mathbf{e}_k\otimes\mathbf{e}_l
    = \tfrac{1}{2}~e_{ijk}~[u_{l,ji} + u_{j,li}]~\mathbf{e}_k\otimes\mathbf{e}_l
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since a change in the order of differentiation does not change the result, &lt;math&gt;u_{l,ji} = u_{l,ij}&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;
   \,e_{ijk} u_{l,ji} = (e_{12k}+e_{21k}) u_{l,12} + (e_{13k}+e_{31k}) u_{l,13} + (e_{23k} + e_{32k}) u_{l,32} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
Also
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tfrac{1}{2}~e_{ijk}~u_{j,li} = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}~e_{ijk}~u_{j,i}\right)_{,l} = \left(\tfrac{1}{2}~e_{kij}~u_{j,i}\right)_{,l} = w_{k,l}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = w_{k,l}~\mathbf{e}_k\otimes\mathbf{e}_l = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{w}
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation between rotation tensor and rotation vector ===
From an important identity regarding the [[Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics)|curl of a tensor]] we know that for a continuous, single-valued displacement field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times(\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u}) = \boldsymbol{0}.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{u} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} + \boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; we have
&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{\omega} = -\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = - \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{w}.
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Strain tensor in cylindrical coordinates ==
In [[cylindrical polar coordinates]] (&lt;math&gt;r, \theta, z&lt;/math&gt;), the displacement vector can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{u} = u_r~\mathbf{e}_r + u_\theta~\mathbf{e}_\theta + u_z~\mathbf{e}_z
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components of the strain tensor in a cylindrical coordinate system are given by &lt;ref name=Slaughter&gt;{{cite book |last1=Slaughter |first1=William S. |title=The Linearized Theory of Elasticity |date=2002 |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media |location=New  York |isbn=9781461266082 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \varepsilon_{rr} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} \\
    \varepsilon_{\theta\theta} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} + u_r\right) \\

    \varepsilon_{r\theta} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} + \cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r}- \cfrac{u_\theta}{r}\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{\theta z} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial z} + \cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial \theta}\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{zr} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial z} + \cfrac{\partial u_z}{\partial r}\right) 
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;

== Strain tensor in spherical coordinates ==
In [[spherical coordinates]] (&lt;math&gt;r, \theta, \phi&lt;/math&gt;), the displacement vector can be written as
[[File:3D Spherical.svg|thumb|240px|right|Spherical coordinates (''r'', ''&amp;theta;'', ''&amp;phi;'') as commonly used in ''physics'': radial distance ''r'', polar angle ''&amp;theta;'' ([[theta]]), and azimuthal angle ''&amp;phi;'' ([[phi]]). The symbol ''&amp;rho;'' ([[rho]]) is often used instead of ''r''.]]
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{u} = u_r~\mathbf{e}_r + u_\theta~\mathbf{e}_\theta + u_\phi~\mathbf{e}_\phi
 &lt;/math&gt;
The components of the strain tensor in a spherical coordinate system are given by &lt;ref name=Slaughter/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \varepsilon_{rr} &amp; = \cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} \\
    \varepsilon_{\theta\theta} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{r}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} + u_r\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{\phi\phi} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{r\sin\theta}\left(\cfrac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial \phi} + u_r\sin\theta + u_\theta\cos\theta\right)\\
    \varepsilon_{r\theta} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{1}{r}\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial \theta} + \cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial r}- \cfrac{u_\theta}{r}\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{\theta \phi} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2r}\left(\cfrac{1}{\sin\theta}\cfrac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \phi} + \cfrac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial \theta} - u_\phi\cot\theta\right) \\
    \varepsilon_{\phi r} &amp; = \cfrac{1}{2}\left(\cfrac{1}{r\sin\theta}\cfrac{\partial u_r}{\partial \phi} + \cfrac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial r} - \cfrac{u_\phi}{r}\right) 
  \end{align}

[[Image:Ion implantation machine at LAAS 0521.jpg|thumb|250px|An ion implantation system at [[Laboratory for analysis and architecture of systems|LAAS]] technological facility in Toulouse, France.]]
'''Ion implantation''' is a low-temperature process by which [[ion (physics)|ion]]s of one element are accelerated into a solid target, thereby changing the physical, chemical, or electrical properties of the target. Ion implantation is used in [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor device fabrication]] and in metal finishing, as well as in [[materials science]] research. The ions can alter the elemental composition of the target (if the ions differ in composition from the target) if they stop and remain in the target.  Ion implantation also causes chemical and physical changes when the ions impinge on the target at high energy. The [[crystal structure]] of the target can be damaged or even destroyed by the energetic [[collision cascade]]s, and ions of sufficiently high energy (10s of MeV) can cause [[nuclear transmutation]].

== General principle ==
[[Image:ion implanter schematic.png|thumb|Ion implantation setup with mass separator]]
Ion implantation equipment typically consists of an [[ion source]], where ions of the desired element are produced, an [[particle accelerator|accelerator]], where the ions are electrostatically accelerated to a high energy, and a target chamber, where the ions impinge on a target, which is the material to be implanted. Thus ion implantation is a special case of [[particle radiation]]. Each ion is typically a single atom or molecule, and thus the actual amount of material implanted in the target is the integral over time of the ion current. This amount is called the dose. The currents supplied by implants are typically small (micro-amperes), and thus the dose which can be implanted in a reasonable amount of time is small. Therefore, ion implantation finds application in cases where the amount of chemical change required is small.

Typical ion energies are in the range of 10 to 500 [[electronvolt|keV]] (1,600 to 80,000 aJ). Energies in the range 1 to 10 keV (160 to 1,600 aJ) can be used, but result in a penetration of only a few nanometers or less. Energies lower than this result in very little damage to the target, and fall under the designation [[ion beam deposition]]. Higher energies can also be used: accelerators capable of 5 MeV (800,000 aJ) are common. However, there is often great structural damage to the target, and because the depth distribution is broad ([[Bragg peak]]), the net composition change at any point in the target will be small.

The energy of the ions, as well as the ion species and the composition of the target determine the depth of penetration of the ions in the solid: A monoenergetic ion beam will generally have a broad depth distribution. The average penetration depth is called the range of the ions. Under typical circumstances ion ranges will be between 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. Thus, ion implantation is especially useful in cases where the chemical or structural change is desired to be near the surface of the target. Ions gradually lose their energy as they travel through the solid, both from occasional collisions with target atoms (which cause abrupt energy transfers) and from a mild drag from overlap of electron orbitals, which is a continuous process. The loss of ion energy in the target is called [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopping]] and can be simulated with the [[binary collision approximation]] method.

Accelerator systems for ion implantation are generally classified into medium current (ion beam currents between 10 μA and ~2 mA), high current (ion beam currents up to ~30 mA), high energy (ion energies above 200 keV and up to 10 MeV), and very high dose (efficient implant of dose greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;16 &lt;/sup&gt;ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

All varieties of ion implantation beamline designs contain certain general groups of functional components (see image). The first major segment of an ion beamline includes a device known as an ion source to generate the ion species. The source is closely coupled to biased electrodes for extraction of the ions into the beamline and most often to some means of selecting a particular ion species for transport into the main accelerator section. The "mass" selection is often accompanied by passage of the extracted ion beam through a magnetic field region with an exit path restricted by blocking apertures, or "slits", that allow only ions with a specific value of the product of mass and velocity/charge to continue down the beamline. If the target surface is larger than the ion beam diameter and a uniform distribution of implanted dose is desired over the target surface, then some combination of beam scanning and wafer motion is used. Finally, the implanted surface is coupled with some method for collecting the accumulated charge of the implanted ions so that the delivered dose can be measured in a continuous fashion and the implant process stopped at the desired dose level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Robert W. | last1=Hamm | first2=Marianne E. | last2=Hamm | title=Industrial Accelerators and Their Applications | publisher=World Scientific | year=2012 | isbn=978-981-4307-04-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in semiconductor device fabrication==
===Doping===
[[Doping (semiconductor)|Semiconductor doping]] with boron, phosphorus, or arsenic is a common application of ion implantation. When implanted in a semiconductor, each dopant atom can create a charge carrier in the semiconductor after [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. A [[Electron hole|hole]] can be created for a [[P-type semiconductor|p-type]] dopant, and an electron for an [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopant. This modifies the conductivity of the semiconductor in its vicinity.  The technique is used, for example, for adjusting the threshold of a [[MOSFET]].

Ion implantation was developed as a method of producing the p-n junction of photovoltaic devices in the late 1970s and early 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Armini, S. N. Bunker and M. B. Spitzer, "Non-mass-analyzed Ion Implantation Equipment for high Volume Solar Cell Production," ''Proc. 16th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference'', 27-30 Sep 1982, San Diego California, pp. 895-899.&lt;/ref&gt; along with the use of pulsed-electron beam for rapid annealing,&lt;ref&gt;G. Landis et al., "Apparatus and Technique for Pulsed Electron Beam Annealing for Solar Cell Production," ''Proc. 15th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conf.,'' Orlando FL; 976-980 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; although it has not to date been used for commercial production.

===Silicon on insulator===
One prominent method for preparing silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates from conventional [[silicon]] substrates is the ''SIMOX'' (separation by implantation of oxygen) process, wherein a buried high dose oxygen implant is converted to silicon oxide by a high temperature [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] process.

===Mesotaxy===
Mesotaxy is the term for the growth of a crystallographically matching phase underneath the surface of the host crystal (compare to [[epitaxy]], which is the growth of the matching phase on the surface of a substrate). In this process, ions are implanted at a high enough energy and dose into a material to create a layer of a second phase, and the temperature is controlled so that the crystal structure of the target is not destroyed. The crystal orientation of the layer can be engineered to match that of the target, even though the exact crystal structure and lattice constant may be very different. For example, after the implantation of nickel ions into a silicon wafer, a layer of nickel silicide can be grown in which the crystal orientation of the silicide matches that of the silicon.

==Application in metal finishing==
===Tool steel toughening===
Nitrogen or other ions can be implanted into a tool steel target (drill bits, for example). The structural change caused by the implantation produces a surface compression in the steel, which prevents crack propagation and thus makes the material more resistant to fracture. The chemical change can also make the tool more resistant to corrosion.

===Surface finishing===
In some applications, for example prosthetic devices such as artificial joints, it is desired to have surfaces very resistant to both chemical corrosion and wear due to friction. Ion implantation is used in such cases to engineer the surfaces of such devices for more reliable performance. As in the case of tool steels, the surface modification caused by ion implantation includes both a surface compression which prevents crack propagation and an alloying of the surface to make it more chemically resistant to corrosion.

==Other applications==
===Ion beam mixing===
Ion implantation can be used to achieve [[ion beam mixing]], i.e. mixing up atoms of different elements at an interface. This may be useful for achieving graded interfaces or strengthening adhesion between layers of immiscible materials.

===Ion implantation-induced [[nanoparticle]] formation===
Ion implantation may be used to induce nano-dimensional particles in oxides such as [[sapphire]] and [[silica]]. The particles may be formed as a result of precipitation of the ion implanted species, they may be formed as a result of the production of an mixed oxide species that contains both the ion-implanted element and the oxide substrate, and they may be formed as a result of a reduction of the substrate, first reported by Hunt and Hampikian.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Eden|last2=Hampikian|first2=Janet|title=Ion implantation-induced nanoscale particle formation in Al2O3 and SiO2 via reduction|journal=Acta Materialia|date=1999|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1497–1511|doi=10.1016/S1359-6454(99)00028-2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645499000282|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunt2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunt|first1=Eden|last2=Hampikian|first2=Janet|title=Implantation parameters affecting aluminum nano-particle formation in alumina|journal=Journal of Materials Science|date=April 2001|volume=36|issue=8|pages=1963–1973|doi=10.1023/A:1017562311310|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1017562311310|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt|first1=Eden|last2=Hampikian|first2=Janet|title=Method for ion implantation induced embedded particle formation via reduction|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6294223.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6294223&amp;RS=PN/6294223|website=uspto.gov|publisher=USPTO|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical ion beam energies used to produce nanoparticles range from 50 to 150 keV, with ion fluences that range from 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Z.|last2=Pisarek|first2=M.|last3=Barlak|first3=M.|last4=Ratajczak|first4=R.|last5=Starosta|first5=W.|last6=Piekoszewski|first6=J.|last7=Szymczyk|first7=W.|last8=Grotzschel|first8=R.|title=Chemical effects in Zr- and Co-implanted sapphire|journal=Vacuum|date=2009|volume=83|pages=S57-S60|doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2009.01.022|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042207X09000487|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alves"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alves|first1=E.|last2=Marques|first2=C.|last3=da Silva|first3=R.C.|last4=Monteiro|first4=T.|last5=Soares|first5=J.|last6=McHargue|first6=C.|last7=Ononye|first7=L.C.|last8=Allard|first8=L.F|title=Structural and optical studies of Co and Ti implanted sapphire|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms|date=2003|volume=207|issue=1|pages=55–62|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(03)00522-6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X03005226|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xiang|first1=X.|last2=Zu|first2=X.

A wide variety of nanoparticles can be formed, with size ranges from 1&amp;nbsp;nm on up to 20&amp;nbsp;nm and with compositions that can contain the implanted species, combinations of the implanted ion and substrate, or that are comprised solely from the cation associated with the substrate.

Composite materials based on dielectrics such as sapphire that contain dispersed metal nanoparticles are promising materials for [[optoelectronics]] and [[nonlinear optics]].&lt;ref name="Stepanov" /&gt;

==Problems with ion implantation==
===Crystallographic damage===
Each individual ion produces many [[crystallographic defect|point defects]] in the target crystal on impact such as vacancies and interstitials. Vacancies are crystal lattice points unoccupied by an atom: in this case the ion collides with a target atom, resulting in transfer of a significant amount of energy to the target atom such that it leaves its crystal site. This target atom then itself becomes a projectile in the solid, and can cause [[collision cascade|successive collision events]].
Interstitials result when such atoms (or the original ion itself) come to rest in the solid, but find no vacant space in the lattice to reside. These point defects can migrate and cluster with each other, resulting in [[dislocation]] loops and other defects.

===Damage recovery===
Because ion implantation causes damage to the crystal structure of the target which is often unwanted, ion implantation processing is often followed by a thermal annealing. This can be referred to as damage recovery.

===Amorphization===
The amount of crystallographic damage can be enough to completely amorphize the surface of the target: i.e. it can become an [[amorphous solid]] (such a solid produced from a melt is called a [[glass]]). In some cases, complete amorphization of a target is preferable to a highly defective crystal: An amorphized film can be regrown at a lower temperature than required to anneal a highly damaged crystal. Amorphisation of the substrate can occur as a result of the beam damage. For example, yttrium ion implantation into sapphire at an ion beam energy of 150 keV to a fluence of 5*10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; Y&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; produces an amorphous glassy layer approximately 110 nm in thickness, measured from the outer surface. [Hunt, 1999]

===Sputtering===
Some of the collision events result in atoms being ejected ([[sputtering|sputtered]]) from the surface, and thus ion implantation will slowly etch away a surface. The effect is only appreciable for very large doses.

===Ion channelling===
[[Image:Diamond structure.png|thumb|right|300 px|A diamond cubic crystal viewed from the [[Crystallography#Notation|&lt;110&gt;]] direction, showing hexagonal ion channels.]]

If there is a crystallographic structure to the target, and especially in semiconductor substrates where the crystal structure is more open, particular crystallographic directions offer much lower stopping than other directions. The result is that the range of an ion can be much longer if the ion travels exactly along a particular direction, for example the &lt;110&gt; direction in [[silicon]] and other [[diamond cubic]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/162575935|title=Materials science of thin films : deposition and structure|last=1936-|first=Ohring, Milton,|date=2002|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780125249751|edition=2nd|location=San Diego, CA|oclc=162575935}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is called ''ion channelling'', and, like all the [[Channelling (physics)|channelling]] effects, is highly nonlinear, with small variations from perfect orientation resulting in extreme differences in implantation depth.  For this reason, most implantation is carried out a few degrees off-axis, where tiny alignment errors will have more predictable effects.

Ion channelling can be used directly in [[Rutherford backscattering]] and related techniques as an analytical method to determine the amount and depth profile of damage in crystalline thin film materials.

== Safety ==

=== Hazardous materials ===
In fabricating [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]], [[toxic]] materials such as [[arsine]] and [[phosphine]] are often used in the ion implanter process. Other common [[carcinogen]]ic, [[Corrosion|corrosive]], [[flammable]], or [[Toxicity|toxic]] elements include [[antimony]], [[arsenic]], [[phosphorus]], and [[boron]]. [[Semiconductor fabrication]] facilities are highly automated, but residue of hazardous elements in machines can be encountered during servicing and in [[vacuum pump]] hardware.

=== High voltages and particle accelerators ===
High voltage power supplies used in ion accelerators necessary for ion implantation can pose a risk of [[electrocution]].  In addition, high-energy atomic collisions can generate [[X-ray]]s and, in some cases, other ionizing radiation and [[radionuclide]]s. In addition to high voltage, [[particle accelerator]]s such as radio frequency [[linear particle accelerator]]s and laser [[Plasma acceleration|wakefield plasma accelerator]]s other hazards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5467">'''John Scales Avery''' (born in 1933 in [[Lebanon]] to American parents) is a theoretical chemist noted for his research publications in [[quantum chemistry]], [[thermodynamics]], [[evolution]], and [[history of science]].  Since the early 1990s, Avery has been an active World [[peace activist]].  During these years, he was part of a group associated with the [[Pugwash Conferences]] on Science and World Affairs.  In 1995, this group received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for their efforts.  Presently, he is an Associate Professor in [[quantum chemistry]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]].  His 2003 book ''Information Theory and Evolution'' set forth the view that the phenomenon of [[life]], including its origin and [[evolution]], that including human [[cultural evolution]], has it background situated over [[thermodynamics]], [[statistical mechanics]], and [[information theory]].

==Early life==
Avery’s parents were both born in the United States, in the state of Michigan, where they studied at the [[University of Michigan]]. His father studied medicine while his mother studied bacteriology. After graduation, his parents did research together at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  Later, his father did research in a borderline area between [[physics]] and [[medicine]] with [[Arthur Holly Compton]], discoverer of the "[[Compton effect]]", at the [[University of Chicago]].
In 1926, his father moved the family to Beirut, where his father worked as a professor of anatomy at the [[American University of Beirut]].  The family stayed in Beirut until the start of World War II.  It was during these tumultuous years that John Scales Avery was born.

==Education==
*1950 - graduated, [[Phillips Academy]], Andover, Mass
*1954 - B.Sc., physics, [[M.I.T]]
*1955 - M.Sc., physics, [[University of Chicago]]
*1965 - Ph.D., theoretical chemistry, [[Imperial College]], London

==Thermodynamics==
{{main|Entropy and life}}
In his recent 2003 book ''Information Theory and Evolution'', Avery combines [[information theory]] with [[thermodynamics]] to account for the phenomenon of life, including its origin and evolution.  Since the beginning of the formulation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] in the 1860s, which states that the [[entropy]], or disorder, of an [[isolated system]] tends to increase with time, there has been a debate as to how this law relates to the "ordering" process of [[evolution]].  The apparent paradox between the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and the high degree of order and complexity produced by living systems, according to Avery, has its resolution "in the information content of the [[Gibbs free energy]] that enters the biosphere from outside sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avery | first = John  | title = Information Theory and Evolution | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2003 | isbn = 981-238-399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kudurru for Šitti-Marduk''' is a white limestone boundary stone ([[Kudurru]]) of [[Nebuchadrezzar I]], a king of the 2nd Dynasty of [[Isin]], ca. the late 12th century BC. He is known to have made at least four kudurru boundary stones.

Some kudurrus are known for their representations of the king, etc, who conscripted the stones production. Most kudurrus are attested by honored gods of [[Mesopotamia]] and are often displayed graphically in segmented [[Register (sculpture)|register]]s on the stone.

The obverse of the ''Kudurru for Šitti-Marduk'' is composed of six [[Register (sculpture)|registers]], with gods, beings (a [[Scorpion man]] for example), etc. The recto contains [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] text, relating the military services of Šitti-Marduk.

[[File:F5 tornado Elie Manitoba 2007.jpg|thumb|An F5 tornado]]
'''Lilapsophobia''' is an abnormal fear of [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s. Lilapsophobia is considered the more severe type of [[astraphobia]], which is a fear of [[thunder]] and [[lightning]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritscher|first=Lisa|title=Lilapsophobia – Fear of Tornadoes or Hurricanes|url=http://phobias.about.com/od/phobiaslist/a/lilapsophobia.htm|website=[[about.com]]|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] basis word is λαῖλα|ψ -απος ''laíla|ps'' -''apos'' for which reason the term should strictly have been *l'''ai'''la'''p'''ophobia – like [[myrmecophobia]] from ''mýrmē|x'' -''ēkos''. Greek words ending in ψ (''ps'') and ξ (''ks'') would regularly become -pos / -kos (respectively) in [[Oblique case|oblique cases]], conventionally given as the genitive form. This rule also obtains for Latin, cf. ''pax'', ''pac''|''is'', and it is from the accusative form ''pacem'' that all [[Romance languages]] have taken their words for “peace”. Historically this rule has been “forgotten” – one result is the fallacious neologism “lila'''ps'''ophobia”.

How the '''''i''''' came into the picture instead of '''''ai''''' remains to be settled. ''Hypothesis'': Since the Greek word ''lailaps'' would reflect American usage in pronouncing *lilaps [laílæps] – it is in the US that tornadoes are commonplace – the latter “hypercorrect” version became the written form. 

==Causes==
Like many phobias, lilapsophobia is caused by an unwanted experience, specifically tornadoes or hurricanes that cause injuries, destruction, or loss of loved ones to self or others they know. People who survive those storms should seek professional advice, especially to determine if a person is suffering [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=about /&gt; This phobia can even be caused by learning news about tornadoes or hurricanes using the media, like television, internet, radio, or newspaper, even though they happened far away from homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Page|first1=S.L.|title=Lilapsophobia: Overcome Your Fear of Tornadoes, Severe Storms, and Hurricanes|url=http://www.registerednursern.com/lilapsophobia-overcome-your-fear-of-tornadoes-severe-storms-and-hurricanes/|website=Registered Nurse RN|accessdate=29 June 2014|date=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person learns that someone in the family has the phobia, then that person is more likely to suffer from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lilapsophobia – Fear of Tornadoes &amp; Hurricanes|url=http://www.remediespoint.com/phobias/lilapsophobia-fear-of-tornadoes-and-hurricanes.html|date=March 11, 2012|accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
Mental and emotional symptoms of lilapsophobia include
* Obsessive thoughts
* Difficulty thinking
* Feeling of unreality or being detached
* Fear of losing control or going crazy
* [[Anticipatory anxiety]]
* Terror
* Desire to flee or hide

Physical symptoms of lilapsophobia include
* Dizziness, shaking, palpitations, lightheaded, or faint
* Shortness of breath
* Accelerated heartbeat
* Chest pain or discomfort
* Shaking
* Feeling of choking
* Sweating
* Nausea
* Numbness or tingling sensations

Many lilapsophobes also suffer [[autophobia]], fear of being alone. Sufferers often make arrangements with people they know to help soothe the fear.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

==Effects==
Lilapsophobes spend a lot of time watching the weather or checking weather online to keep an eye out for oncoming storms. When a storm hits, sufferers either watch for severe weather alerts constantly or take cover, like under the bed or in the windowless room. In the extreme cases, sufferers take tornado shelter as soon as rain starts falling,&lt;ref name=about /&gt; usually in the basement or [[storm shelter]]. Sufferers who have weather radio or mobile phones can watch the radar and alerts using it while hiding.

==In children==
Like astraphobia, lilapsophobia is a common fear for children, although less common. Because children are just learning to distinguish between fantasy and reality, major storm broadcasts on television or discussion by parents can cause fear that the storm is coming with a tornadic potential or a hurricane.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

Because fear is a part of normal child development, this phobia is not diagnosed unless if persisted for more than six months. Parents should conquer the child's fear by telling them how rare the major storms that hit hometown area are.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

==Treatment==
Like many other phobias, lilapsophobia can often be treated using [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]], but if it stems from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], then alternative therapy may be more recommended.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 1996 film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'', Dr. Jo Harding ([[Helen Hunt]]), while becoming a storm chaser, suffers from lilapsophobia due to her father's death in a tornado when she was a child.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

The 2011 [[Joplin tornado|tornado in Joplin]] prompted Karin R. Herrmann of [[Miami, Oklahoma]], who suffered from lilapsophobia, to write about her experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrmann|first=Karin R.|title=Panic set in after the May 22 tornado|journal=Joplin Independent|year=2011|url=http://www.joplinindependent.com/display_article.php/111karin1320333668|accessdate=13 October 2014|publisher=Online News Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrmann |first1=Karin R. |title=Tornado Phobia (Lilapsophobia): Caught in the Vortex |url=http://www.fearofstuff.com/featured/tornado-phobia-lilapsophobia-caught-in-the-vortex/ |website=Fear of Stuff |accessdate=13 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206120835/http://www.fearofstuff.com/featured/tornado-phobia-lilapsophobia-caught-in-the-vortex/ |archivedate= 6 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herrmann|first=Karin R.|title=Battling a Weather Phobia|url=http://severestormphobias.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/battling-a-weather-phobia/#more-43|website=Severe Storm &amp; Weather Phobias|accessdate=13 October 2014|date=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">'''Mixed dark matter''' ('''MDM''') is a theory of [[dark matter]] (DM) proposed during the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew R Liddle, David H Lyth (1993). [astro-ph/9304017]  [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9304017 Inflation and Mixed Dark Matter Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed dark matter is also called hot + cold dark matter. The most abundant form of dark matter is cold dark matter, almost one fourth of the energy contents of the Universe. [[neutrino|Neutrinos]] are the only known particles whose Big-Bang thermal relic should compose at least a fraction of [[Hot dark matter]] (HDM), albeit other candidates are speculated to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan A. Dobrescu and Don Lincoln: [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-hidden-world-of-complex-dark-matter-could-be-uncovered/ A Hidden World of Complex Dark Matter Could Be Uncovered]. Scientific American. Volume 313, Issue 1. pp. 20-27.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the early 1990s, the power spectrum of fluctuations in the galaxy clustering did not agree entirely with the predictions for a standard cosmology built around pure cold DM. Mixed dark matter with a composition of about 80% cold and 20% hot (neutrinos) was investigated and found to agree better with observations. This large amount of HDM was made obsolete by the discovery in 1998 of the [[accelerating expansion of the universe|acceleration of universal expansion]], which eventually led to the [[dark energy]] + dark matter paradigm of this decade.{{CN|date=April 2016}}

The cosmological effects of cold DM are almost opposite to the hot DM effects. Given that cold DM promotes the growth of large scale structures, it is often believed to be composed of [[Weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs). Conversely hot DM suffers of free-streaming for most of the history of the Universe, washing-out the formation of small scales. In other words, the mass of hot DM particles is too small to produce the observed gravitationally bounded objects in the Universe. For that reason, the hot DM abundance is constrained by Cosmology to less than one percent of the Universe contents.

The Mixed Dark Matter scenario recovered relevance when DM was proposed to be a thermal relic of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] made of very light bosonic particles, as light as neutrinos or even lighter like the [[Axion]]. This cosmological model predicts that cold DM is made of a large number of condensed particles, while a small fraction of these particles resides in excited energetic states contributing to hot DM.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez-Montoya:2013/&gt;

[[Image:Gentleman with waxed moustache ca. 1910.jpg|thumb|right|Gentleman with a waxed moustache ca. 1910 wearing a [[Homburg hat]] and [[pince nez]]]]
'''Moustache wax''' is a stiff [[pomade]] applied to a [[moustache]] as a grooming aid to hold the [[hair]]s in place, especially at the extremities. The required product strength (or stiffness) is based on whisker length and the desired style. It can also have restorative properties, which become more important as the hair length increases. The wax is usually scented and sometimes pigmented with dyes; high end products utilize various combinations of [[iron oxide]] to create darker shades.

Generally less than a fingernail of wax is used when applied. More sophisticated recipes may include [[gum arabic]] and a soap, scent and colouring may also be added if desired, to either strengthen the hold or for comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handlebarclub.co.uk/wax/diy.shtm|title=D.I.Y. Moustache Wax|publisher=The Handlebar Club|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common ingredients==

*[[Beeswax]]
*[[Coconut oil]] or [[Shea butter|shea nut butter]] (or any saturated vegetable oil, solid at room temperature, and not prone to rancidity)
*[[Petroleum jelly]] ([[Vaseline]])
*[[Gum arabic]] or [[pine resin]]
*[[essential oil|Scented oils]]
*[[Tallow]]

In addition to the wax itself, more-experienced "waxers" use a moustache wax remover and conditioner. The reason for this is that warm soapy water (used by the novice) removes wax build-up but damages the bristles by stripping them of natural oils, so an oil{{nbhyph}}based moustache wax remover, that may double as a leave{{nbhyph}}in conditioner, is preferred by some.{{efn| 1 =Taken from ''Beard and Moustache Conditioning Manual'' For the Whiskered Warrior to the Everyday Gent}}

In electronics, the '''NORBIT''' family of modules is a very early form (since 1960&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Norbit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MBLE_1962_Norbit"/&gt;) of [[Digital electronics|digital logic]] developed by [[Philips]] (and also provided through {{ill|Valvo (company){{!}}Valvo|de|Valvo}} and [[Mullard]]&lt;ref name="TM2671_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TM2672_1967"/&gt;) that uses modules containing discrete components to build logic function blocks in [[resistor–transistor logic]] (RTL)&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Norbit"/&gt; or [[diode–transistor logic]] (DTL) technology.

==Overview==
The system was originally conceived as building blocks for [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]]&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MBLE_1962_Norbit"/&gt; hard-wired programmed logic controllers (the predecessors of [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLC)) to replace electro-mechanical [[relay logic]] in [[industrial control system]]s for [[process control]] and [[automation]] applications, similar to early [[Telefunken]]/[[AEG]] [[Logistat]], [[Siemens]] {{ill|Simatic|de}}, [[BBC]] [[Sigmatronic]], [[ACEC (company)|ACEC]] [[Logacec]] or {{ill|Akkord-Radio{{!}}Akkord|de|Akkord-Radio}} [[Estacord]] systems.&lt;!-- and Mibakron modules by Krone KG, Berlin, other systems: Bistat, Norlog --&gt;&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akkord_Estacord"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klingelnberg_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weissel_1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker_2012"/&gt;

Each available logical function was recognizable by the color of its plastic container, black, blue, red, green, violet, etc. The most important circuit block contained a [[Logical NOR|NOR]] gate (hence the name), but there were also blocks containing drivers, and a timer circuit similar to the later [[555 timer IC]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;

The original ''Norbit'' modules of the YL&amp;nbsp;6000 series introduced in 1960 had [[potting (electronics)|potted]] [[single in-line package]]s with up to ten long flying leads arranged in two groups of up to five leads in a row.&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Norbit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MBLE_1962_Norbit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valvo_1964_Norbit"/&gt; These modules were specified for frequencies of less than 1&amp;nbsp;kHz at ±24&amp;nbsp;V supply.&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Norbit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valvo_1964_Norbit"/&gt;

Also available in 1960 were so called ''Combi-Element''&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_3"/&gt; modules in single-in line packages with ten evenly spaced stiff leads in a row (5.08&amp;nbsp;mm / 0.2-inch pitch) for mounting on a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]].&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullard_1963_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gossel_1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barneveld_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valvo_1964_Norbit"/&gt; They were grouped in the 1-series (aka "100&amp;nbsp;kHz series")&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_1"/&gt; with ±6&amp;nbsp;V supply.&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valvo_1964_Norbit"/&gt; The newer 10-series and 20-series had similarly sized packages, but came with an additional parallel row of nine staggered leads for a total of 19 leads.&lt;ref name="Barneveld_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt; The 10-series uses [[germanium]] [[alloy transistor]]s, whereas in the 20-series [[silicon]] [[planar transistor]]s are used for a higher cut-off frequency of up to 1&amp;nbsp;MHz (vs. 30&amp;nbsp;kHz) and a higher allowed temperature range of +85&amp;nbsp;°C (vs. +55&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="Barneveld_1967"/&gt;

In 1967, the Philips/Mullard NORBIT&amp;nbsp;2&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elektuur_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philips_1967_NORBIT2"/&gt; aka Valvo NORBIT-S&lt;ref name="R6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Folkert_1973"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_4"/&gt; family of modules was introduced, first consisting of the 60-series&lt;ref name="R4"/&gt; for frequencies up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz at a single supply voltage of 24&amp;nbsp;V,&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt; only. Later, the 61-series,&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt; containing [[thyristor]] trigger and control modules, was added. A 90-series&lt;ref name="Philips_1980"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_2"/&gt; became available in the mid-1970s as well. There were three basic types contained in a large (one by two inch-sized) 17 pins [[dual in-line package]], with nine pins spaced 5.08&amp;nbsp;mm (0.2-inch) on one side and eight staggered pins on the other side.&lt;ref name="R3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean_1973"/&gt;

== Notes ==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_1"&gt;Some later &lt;!-- 1980 --&gt;datasheets distinguished between the 100&amp;nbsp;kHz series and the 1-series.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_2"&gt;The modules of the 90-series&lt;!-- 1980 --&gt; were grouped into the 60-series in early&lt;!-- 1974 --&gt; datasheets.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_3"&gt;[[Mullard]] called these modules ''Combi-Element'' in the UK, whereas [[Philips]] and {{ill|Valvo (company){{!}}Valvo|de|Valvo}} just called them circuit blocks, but distinguished them from the original ''Norbit'' series.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_4"&gt;So far, the assumed equivalence of {{ill|Valvo (company){{!}}Valvo|de|Valvo}}'s Norbit-S series with the [[Philips]] Norbit&amp;nbsp;2 series is based on their release date in 1967. Often, the modules of the newer families were still referred to as ''Norbits'' only.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative luminescence''' is a physical phenomenon by which an electronic device emits less [[thermal radiation]] when an [[electric current]] is passed through it than it does in [[thermal equilibrium]] (current off). When viewed by a [[thermal camera]], an operating negative luminescent device looks colder than its environment.

== Physics ==
Negative luminescence is most readily observed in [[semiconductor]]s. Incoming [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed in the material by the creation of an [[electron–hole pair]]. An [[electric field]] is used to remove the electrons and holes from the region before they have a chance to recombine and re-emit thermal radiation. This effect occurs most efficiently in regions of low charge carrier density.

Negative luminescence has also been observed in semiconductors in orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. In this case, the junction of a diode is not necessary and the effect can be observed in bulk material. A term that has been applied to this type of negative luminescence is ''galvanomagnetic luminescence''.

Negative luminescence might appear to be a violation of [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]. This is not true, as the law only applies in [[thermal equilibrium]].

Another term that has been used to describe negative luminescent devices is "[[Emissivity]] switch", as an electric current changes the effective emissivity.

== History ==
This effect was first seen by Russian physicists in the 1960s in A.F.Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, Leningrad, Russia. Subsequently, it was studied in [[semiconductors]] such as [[indium antimonide]] (InSb), [[germanium]] (Ge) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) by workers in [[West Germany]], [[Ukraine]] (Institute of Semiconductor Physics, [[Kiev]]), Japan ([[Chiba University]]) and the United States. It was first observed in the mid-infrared (3-5 [[µm]] [[wavelength]]) in the more convenient [[diode]] structures in InSb [[heterostructure]] diodes by workers at the [[Defence Research Agency]], [[Great Malvern]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] (now [[QinetiQ]]). These British workers later demonstrated LWIR band (8-12&amp;nbsp;µm) negative luminescence using [[HgCdTe|mercury cadmium telluride]] [[diode]]s.

Later the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], [[Washington DC]], started work on negative luminescence in [[mercury cadmium telluride]] (HgCdTe). The phenomenon has since been observed by several university groups around the world.

The '''New South Wales Coal Compensation Review Tribunal''' was a [[tribunal]] in [[New South Wales]], a state of [[Australia]], which had responsibility for determining [[appeal (law)|appeals]] about compensation payable when coal in the state was compulsorily acquired during 1981. The tribunal was in operation between 1985 and 1 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawkerbritton.com/hawker-britton-media/public-affairs/nsw-legislative-laws-update-jan08.htm |title=NSW Laws – An Update |work= |publisher=[[Hawker Britton]] |date=January 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In 1981 the [[New South Wales Government]] passed legislation which [[vested]] all unmined coal to the crown.  The effect of ''Coal Acquisition Act 1981'' (NSW) was that the government became the owner of all unmined coal in the state.  Vesting of the ownership of the coal enabled the government to tax the mining of coal, a situation it was not allowed to do when coal was privately owned. According to the [[New South Wales Coal Compensation Board]]’s annual report,&lt;ref name=AR/&gt; the net benefit to the State from the acquisition of private coal is estimated at around $10 billion after taking into account compensation payments totalling $682 million

The board and the tribunal were established in 1985 to address concerns by former coal owners through the introduction of the Act.  Both bodies were the result of recommendations of the Coal Compensation Taskforce Report.

==Constitution==
The tribunal was established under the ''Coal Acquisition (Compensation) Arrangements 1985'' (NSW).  Those arrangements were made by the [[Governor of New South Wales]] under the ''Coal Acquisition Act 1981'' (NSW), a law which entitles the governor to determine what compensation should be payable for the acquisition of coal in 1981. The tribunal consisted of six members appointed by the Governor. Two of those members were lawyers nominated by the [[Attorney General of New South Wales]]. The remaining four members were nominated by the Minister for Mineral Resources and were generally persons who have expertise in the coal industry.

The Governor may appoint one of the lawyer members as the chairperson and the other as deputy chairperson. There was also provision for the Governor to appoint alternates for the members.

==Jurisdiction==
The tribunal had jurisdiction to decide whether the compensation determined as payable by the board as a result of the compulsory acquisition of coal is correct. It may also determine the amount of compensation payable as a result of that acquisition. The tribunal sat as a three-member panel with either the chairperson or deputy presiding.

The chairperson immediately prior to the Tribunal's abolition was Mr G. R. Leader.

==Caseload==

According to the tribunal's 2005 Annual Report, it determined 67 appeals in 2004 and had 26 outstanding.&lt;ref name=AR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/57615/20060404/Annual_Report_2005.pdf |title=Annual Report |work= |publisher=[[New South Wales Coal Compensation Board]] |date=2005 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New South Wales Government]] flagged that it wished for all compensation claims to be determined by March 2007 and the tribunal will cease once all those claims have been finalised.

==Appeals==
There were no appeal rights from the decision of the tribunal. In certain cases, prerogative relief may be available from the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]], such as ''NSW Coal Compensation Board'' v Nardell Colliery Pty Ltd''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=NSW Coal Compensation Board v Nardell Colliery P/L |link=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/scjudgments/2004nswca.nsf/32a6f466fc42eb68ca256739000a724d/da59702ebfc0e320ca256e4400027dfa?OpenDocument |court=NSWCA |num=35 |year=2004 |pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=|courtname=Court of Appeal |juris=NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

Up until its abolition in 2008, the tribunal had its office at Level 16, No. 1 Castlereagh Street, [[Sydney central business district|Sydney]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">'''NIS''' ('''Nuclear Information Service''') is a not-for-profit, independent information service based in the UK, which works to promote public awareness and foster debate on [[nuclear disarmament]] and related safety and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearinfo.org/ Nuclear Information Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

NIS conducts original research, providing information on the public interest issues surrounding nuclear weapons. This results in reports, articles, press releases, legal action and consultation services to other organizations, parliament and government agencies.

NIS has a unique role in the UK [[nuclear disarmament]] field. Over the years it has focused in from general peace and disarmament work to concentrate on serving the disarmament community, media and decision-makers with research on the maintenance and transport of nuclear weapons. This work has included research on the Atomic Weapons Establishment at [[Aldermaston]] and [[Burghfield]] and includes work on warhead modification, new warhead development, decommisioning, nuclear convoys, outsourcing/privatisation, costs and delays, safety and accidents.

NIS circulates information through its website http://www.nuclearinfo.org,  newsletters and blogs and links individuals working on similar issues. Its archives go back to 1991 and NIS is the successor to NIP (Nuclear Information Project). It became an incorporated company limited by guarantee in 2000 and is funded by charitable foundations and public donations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9521">'''Omega-3 carboxylic acids'''&lt;ref&gt;"Omega-3 carboxylic acids" is the [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]], see [http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-science/united-states-adopted-names-council/adopted-names.page? here] under 2014 and the proposed [[International nonproprietary name|INN]] - see 3.8 [https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2014-003638-26/SE#D here]&lt;/ref&gt; ('''Epanova''') is an [[FDA]] approved prescription medication used alongside a [[low fat]] and low cholesterol diet that lowers high [[triglyceride]] (fat) levels in adults with very high levels.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt; This was the third class of [[fish oil]]-based drug to be approved for use as a drug.  The first approval was granted in the US came in 2014.  These fish oil drugs are similar to fish oil [[dietary supplements]] but the ingredients are better controlled and have been tested in clinical trials.

== Medical uses ==
Omega-3 carboxylic acids are used in addition to changes in diet to reduce [[triglyceride]] levels in adults with severe (≥ 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) [[hypertriglyceridemia]].&lt;ref name=EpanovaLabel&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/205060s000lbl.pdf Epanova label] Revised: May, 2014.  Updates can be found at FDA label page [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&amp;ApplNo=205060&amp;DrugName=EPANOVA&amp;ActiveIngred=OMEGA%2D3%2DCARBOXYLIC%20ACIDS&amp;SponsorApplicant=ASTRAZENECA%20PHARMS&amp;ProductMktStatus=1&amp;goto=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intake of large doses (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids as prescription drugs or dietary supplements are generally required to achieve significant (&gt; 15%) lowering of triglycerides, and at those doses the effects can be significant (from 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with levels greater that 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL).  It appears that both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lower triglycerides, but DHA appears to raise [[LDL-C]] ("bad cholesterol") more than EPA, while DHA raises [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL-C]] ("good cholesterol") while EPA does not.&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015&gt;Jacobson TA, et al, NLA Expert Panel.

===Dietary supplements===
There are many fish oil dietary supplements on the market.&lt;ref name=2015CompareRev/&gt;   There appears to be little difference between in effect between dietary supplement and prescription forms of omega-3 fatty acids but EPA and DHA ethyl esters (prescription forms) work less well when taken on an empty stomach or with a low-fat meal.&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015/&gt;  The ingredients of dietary supplements are not as carefully controlled as prescription products and have not been fixed and tested in clinical trials, as prescription drugs have,&lt;ref name=emedDrugs&gt;Sweeney MET.

== Side effects ==
Special caution should be taken with people who have with [[Fish Allergy|fish and shellfish allergies]].&lt;ref name=EpanovaLabel/&gt; In addition, as with other omega-3 fatty acids, taking omega-3 carboxylic acids puts people who are on [[anticoagulants]] at risk for prolonged [[bleeding time]].&lt;ref name=EpanovaLabel/&gt;&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015/&gt;

Side effects include [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[abdominal pain]], and burping.&lt;ref name=EpanovaLabel/&gt;

Omega-3 carboxylic acids have not been tested in pregnant women and are rated [[Pregnancy category#United States|pregnancy category C]]; it is excreted in breast milk and the effects on infants are not known.&lt;ref name=EpanovaLabel/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Omega-3 carboxylic acids are directly absorbed in the small intestine; maximum plasma concentrations are achieved between 5–8 hours after dosing for total EPA and between 5–9 hours after dosing for total DHA.  Both DHA and EPA are mainly metabolized in the liver like other fatty acids derived from food.  The half-life of EPA from Omega-3 carboxylic acids is about 37 hours, and for DHA about 46 hours.&lt;ref name=EpanovaLabel/&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Omega-3 carboxylic acids, like other omega-3 fatty acid based drugs, appears to reduce production of triglycerides in the liver, and to enhance clearance of triglycerides from circulating [[very low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) particles; the way it does that is not clear, but potential mechanisms include increased [[Beta oxidation|breakdown of fatty acids]]; inhibition of [[diglyceride acyltransferase]] which is involved in biosynthesis of triglycerides in the liver; and increased activity of [[lipoprotein lipase]] in blood.&lt;ref name=2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weintraub|first1=HS|title=Overview of prescription omega-3 fatty acid products for hypertriglyceridemia|journal=Postgrad Med|date=2014|volume=126|pages=7–18|doi=10.3810/pgm.2014.11.2828|pmid=25387209|url=https://postgradmed.org/doi/10.3810/pgm.2014.11.2828|accessdate=20 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150420181910/https://postgradmed.org/doi/10.3810/pgm.2014.11.2828|archivedate=20 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and chemical properties==
Omega-3 carboxylic acids are derived from [[fish oil]] and are a purified mixture of the polyunsaturated [[Fatty acid#Esterified, free, unsaturated, conjugated|free]] fatty acids [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA).&lt;ref name=2015CompareRev/&gt;  The drug contains a concentration of DHA at 15-25 % and a concentration of EPA at 50-60%.&lt;ref name=EpanovaLabel/&gt;

==History==
Omega-3 carboxylic acids was approved by the US FDA in May 2014&lt;ref name="Epanova omega-3-carboxylic acids"&gt;{{cite web|title=Epanova (omega-3-carboxylic acids)|url=http://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/1324/epanova-omega-3-carboxylic-acids|website=CenterWatch|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the third prescription form of an [[omega-3]] product approved in the [[United States]] but the first in free fatty acid form.&lt;ref name=emed&gt;{{EMedicine|article|126568|Hypertriglyceridemia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blair HA, Dhillon S.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-line diagram has its largest application in [[Power flow study|power flow studies]]. Electrical elements such as circuit breakers, transformers, capacitors, [[Busbar|bus bars]], and conductors are shown by standardized schematic symbols.&lt;ref name=csd/&gt; Instead of representing each of three phases with a separate line or terminal, only one conductor is represented. It is a form of [[block diagram]] graphically depicting the paths for power flow between entities of the system. Elements on the diagram do not represent the physical size or location of the electrical equipment, but it is a common convention to organize the diagram with the same left-to-right, top-to-bottom  sequence as the [[switchgear]] or other apparatus represented. A one-line diagram can also be used to show a high level view of conduit runs for a [[Power-line_communication|PLC]] control system.

==Balanced systems==
The theory of three-phase power systems tells us that as long as the [[Electrical load|load]]s on each of the three phases are balanced, we can consider each phase separately.&lt;ref name=guile_paterson&gt;

A one-line diagram is usually used along with other notational simplifications, such as the [[per-unit system]].

A secondary advantage to using a one-line diagram is that the simpler diagram leaves more space for non-electrical, such as [[Energy economics|economic]], information to be included.

==Unbalanced systems==
When using the method of [[symmetrical components]], separate one-line diagrams are made for each of the positive, negative and zero-sequence systems. This simplifies the analysis of unbalanced conditions of a polyphase system. Items that have different impedances for the different [[phase sequence]]s are identified on the diagrams.  For example, in general a [[Electric generator|generator]] will have different positive and negative sequence impedance, and certain transformer winding connections block zero-sequence currents. The unbalanced system can be resolved into three single line diagrams for each sequence, and interconnected to show how the unbalanced components add in each part of the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7693">The '''Parris Manufacturing Company''' of [[Savannah, Tennessee]] is an American company that primarily manufactures [[toy gun]]s.&lt;ref name="parrismfgco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parrismfgco.com/home.html|title=Toy Air Gun Western Cap Gun Military Frontier|publisher=parrismfgco.com|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Iowa inventor William G. Dunn (1883–1968) originally owned a hardware business in [[Clarinda, Iowa]]. With the start of World War I, Dunn created the Dunn Counterbalance Company that operated out of the hardware store until he built a factory in Clarinda and renamed his company the Dunn Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name="pa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://user.pa.net/~the.macs/PDTR.html|title=PARRIS-DUNN TRAINING RIFLE|publisher=user.pa.net|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn was responsible for 48 patents, 7 to do with wind power.&lt;ref name="dailygate.com"&gt;http://www.dailygate.com/articles/2007/12/19/opinion/07.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The Dunn Manufacturing Company also built a 3-seat Cruzeaire Monoplane in 1928.&lt;ref name="aerofiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerofiles.com/_d.html|title=American airplanes: Da - Dy|publisher=aerofiles.com|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Dunn teamed up with Cecil Lewis "Catfish" Parris, a marketing specialist, to form the Parris-Dunn company. The company was formed with Parris as President and Dunn as Vice President to sell a [[wind turbine|wind driven generator]] &lt;ref name="freepatentsonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2178047.html|title=Wind driven generator structure - Cecil, Parris L.|publisher=freepatentsonline.com|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; for farms to recharge electrical items. The Dunn Governing Principle was able to use a controllable propellor speed with fewer moving parts than other wind generators.&lt;ref name="dailygate.com"/&gt; The idea was successful with over 37,000 units created the next year that were sold throughout the USA and foreign countries.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jdd47/pdhistory1.html |title=WebCite query result |publisher=webcitation.org |accessdate=2015-01-12 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knxDsURg |archivedate=October 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philco]] Electronics contracted with Parris-Dunn to put their well known name on their "Skychargers" and marketed the items to their customers.&lt;ref name="philcoradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philcoradio.com/history/hist3.htm|title=Philcoradio.com - The History of Philco, Chapter 3|publisher=philcoradio.com|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
With surplus American arms sent to England and other countries prior to America's involvement in World War II, the American military suffered a severe shortage of rifles. As the U.S. Government decided that wind generators were not a priority item, Parris-Dunn could only manufacture spare parts for the ones in use. When the company sought some war work the government recommended making [[Drill Purpose Rifle|dummy training rifle]]s with wood and metal that copied the [[M1903 Springfield]].&lt;ref&gt;pp.95–97 Brophy, William S. ''The Springfield M1903 Rifles'' 1985 Stackpole Books&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parris U.S. Training Rifle Mk1 Navy.jpg|thumb|left|Parris-Dunn  U.S. Training Rifle Mk1 Navy]]
Impressed by the rifles made for the [[US Army]], the [[US Navy]] contacted Parris-Dunn in June 1942 to order their own rifles that they insisted have bayonet studs, adjustable rear sights, and working triggers with a clicker mechanism; the weapon becoming the USN MK 1 Dummy Training Rifle.&lt;ref name="usmilitaryknives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmilitaryknives.com/knife_knotes_9.htm|title=Knife Knotes 9|publisher=usmilitaryknives.com|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy ordered 190,000 for their first order. A plastic copy of the [[M1905 bayonet]] and scabbard was manufactured
by the [[Pro-Phy-Lac-Tic Brush Company]] who usually manufactured [[toothbrush]]es. With [[walnut]] in high demand for real rifles, Parris-Dunn used cheaper wood further reducing the cost of the rifles.

Over 500,000 rifles were produced with Parris-Dunn being awarded the [[Army-Navy ‘E’ Award]].

==Postwar==
With the end of the war, the training rifles were sold as surplus. From 1943, Parris had approached the company's chief engineer, Maurice Greiman with the idea of Parris-Dunn manufacturing [[toy weapon]] [[popgun]]s of a [[Wild West|Western]] style that shot corks for the use of children and [[traveling carnival]]s.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Mechanics|publisher=Hearst Magazines|issn=0032-4558|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1d8DAAAAMBAJ|page=38|accessdate=2015-01-12|date=September 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfYDAAAAMBAJ|page=67|accessdate=2015-01-12|date=1949-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parris had Cowboy models called Cowboy Pla Guns, Trainerifles, and Shootrite guns in larger sizes for adults to practice cork gun marksmanship indoors.&lt;ref&gt;http://user.pa.net/~the.macs/PDTOY.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunn retired in 1949 with Parris moving the company to Savannah, Tennessee where it remains.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;
During the [[American Civil War Centennial|Civil War Centennial]] the company manufactured replica cork shooting Civil War muskets and pistols.

The company manufactured full size replicas of the M1903 Springfield and smaller sized models for children that featured a working bolt with a dummy bullet, leather sling, the clicker action, and a smaller rubber bayonet similar to the [[M1 bayonet]].

In the 1960s Parris used the cork gun design to make several types of [[BB gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Beeman, Robert D. &amp; Allen, John B. ''Blue Book of Air Guns'' 2007 Blue Book Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

So much of the mail to the Parris Manufacturing Company was missent to [[Savannah, Georgia]] that Cecil Parris visited the local post office and had the postmaster add "Catfish Capital of the World" to the [[postmark]].&lt;ref name="outdoorlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outdoorlife.com/node/45412|title=Catfish Capital: Savannah, Tennessee &amp;#124; Outdoor Life|publisher=outdoorlife.com|accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kadets of America==
In 1953 Parris started the idea of Kadet [[Military Drill Team]]s that communities could form. Purchasers of Kadet toy weapons would receive a free comic book drawn by [[Kurt Schaffenberger]] for Customs Comics Inc. telling the story of an imaginary boy named Bob Duncan who became a Kadet and advanced to the rank of Captain. The comic book featured instructions how to do the American [[manual of arms]] and offered the full range of Kadet Trainer Rifles, cork firing weapons, rank insignia, and dress and fatigue uniforms for both girls and boys featuring a white riding helmet. The brochure also featured a Kadet Officer's Training School located on a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in Savannah and a Kadet song. From 1953 to around 1970 when the programme ended, the Kadets had over 16,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courieranywhere.com/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=548&amp;Itemid=26&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paschen's law''' is an equation that gives the [[breakdown voltage]], that is, the [[voltage]] necessary to start a discharge or [[electric arc]], between two electrodes in a gas as a function of pressure and gap length.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paschen studied the breakdown [[voltage]] of various [[gas]]es between parallel metal plates as the gas [[pressure]] and gap [[distance]] were varied:
* With a constant gap length, the voltage necessary to [[Electric arc|arc]] across the gap decreased as the pressure was reduced and then increased gradually, exceeding its original value. 
* With a constant pressure, the voltage needed to cause an arc reduced as the gap size was reduced but only to a point. As the gap was reduced further, the voltage required to cause an arc began to rise and again exceeded its original value.

For a given gas, the voltage is a function only of the product of the pressure and gap length.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadhwa" /&gt; The curve he found of voltage versus the pressure-gap length product ''(right)'' is called '''Paschen's curve'''. He found an equation that fit these curves, which is now called Paschen's law.&lt;ref name="Wadhwa" /&gt;

At higher pressures and gap lengths, the breakdown voltage is approximately ''proportional'' to the product of pressure and gap length, and the term Paschen's law is sometimes used to refer to this simpler relation.&lt;ref name="Graf"&gt;{{cite book

==Paschen curve==
Early [[vacuum]] experimenters found a rather surprising behavior.  An arc would sometimes take place in a long irregular path rather than at the minimal distance between the electrodes. For example, in air, at a pressure of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], the distance for minimal breakdown voltage is about 7.5&amp;nbsp;µm. The voltage required to arc this distance is 327&amp;nbsp;V, which is insufficient to ignite the arcs for gaps that are either wider or narrower. For a 3.5&amp;nbsp;µm gap, the required voltage is 533&amp;nbsp;V, nearly twice as much. If 500&amp;nbsp;V were applied, it would not be sufficient to arc at the 2.85&amp;nbsp;µm distance, but would arc at a 7.5&amp;nbsp;µm distance.

Paschen found that breakdown voltage was described by the equation&lt;ref name="Lieberman2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of plasma discharges and materials processing|last1=Lieberman|first1=Michael A.|last2=Lichtenberg|first2=Allan J.|publisher=Wiley-Interscience| location=Hoboken, N.J.|at=546|isbn=978-0471005773|oclc=59760348|edition=2nd|date=2005|url=http://www.slideshare.net/elquseooso/principles-of-plasma-discharges-and-materials-processing-2nd-edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V_\text{B} = \frac{Bpd}{\ln(Apd) - \ln\left[\ln\left(1 + \frac{1}{\gamma_\text{se}}\right)\right]},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the breakdown voltage in [[volt]]s, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]], &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the gap distance in [[Meter (unit)|meters]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\text{se}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Secondary emission|secondary-electron-emission]] coefficient (the number of secondary electrons produced per incident positive ion), &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the saturation ionization in the gas at a particular &lt;math&gt;E/p&lt;/math&gt; ([[electric field]]/pressure), and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is related to the excitation and ionization energies.

The [[Coefficient|constants]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are determined experimentally and found to be roughly constant over a restricted range of &lt;math&gt;E/p&lt;/math&gt; for any given gas. For example, [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] with an &lt;math&gt;E/p&lt;/math&gt; in the range of 450 to 7500&amp;nbsp;V/(kPa·cm), &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 112.50 (kPa·cm)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; = 2737.50 V/(kPa·cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Husain|first1=E.|last2=Nema|first2=R.|title=Analysis of Paschen Curves for air, N2 and SF6 Using the Townsend Breakdown Equation|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation|date=August 1982|volume=EI-17|issue=4|pages=350–353|doi=10.1109/TEI.1982.298506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graph of this equation is the Paschen curve. By differentiating it with respect to &lt;math&gt;pd&lt;/math&gt; and setting the derivative to zero, the minimal voltage can be found. This yields

: &lt;math&gt;pd = 
\frac{{e}\mathrm{\cdot}\ln{\mathrm{(}}{1}\mathrm{{+}}\frac{1}{{\mathit{\gamma}}_{se}}{\mathrm{)}}}{A}

&lt;/math&gt;

and predicts the occurrence of a minimal breakdown voltage for &lt;math&gt;pd&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 7.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m·atm. This is 327&amp;nbsp;V in [[air]] at standard atmospheric pressure at a distance of 7.5&amp;nbsp;µm.

The composition of the gas determines both the minimal arc voltage and the distance at which it occurs. For [[argon]], the minimal arc voltage is 137&amp;nbsp;V at a larger 12&amp;nbsp;µm.  For [[sulfur dioxide]], the minimal arc voltage is 457&amp;nbsp;V at only 4.4&amp;nbsp;µm.

===Long gaps===
For air at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP), the voltage needed to arc a 1-meter gap is about 3.4&amp;nbsp;MV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Paul | title = College physics | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0879012687 |p=467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of the [[electric field]] for this gap is therefore 3.4&amp;nbsp;MV/m.

The electric field needed to arc across the minimal-voltage gap is much greater than what is necessary to arc a gap of one meter. For a 7.5&amp;nbsp;µm gap the arc voltage is 327&amp;nbsp;V, which is 43&amp;nbsp;MV/m. This is about 13 times greater than the field strength for the 1-meter gap. The phenomenon is well verified experimentally and is referred to as the Paschen minimum.

The equation loses accuracy for gaps under about 10&amp;nbsp;µm in air at one atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and incorrectly predicts an infinite arc voltage at a gap of about 2.7 micrometers. Breakdown voltage can also differ from the Paschen curve prediction for very small electrode gaps, when [[field electron emission|field emission]] from the cathode surface becomes important.

==Physical mechanism==
The [[mean free path]] of a molecule in a gas is the average distance between its collision with other molecules. This is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas. In air the mean free path of molecules is about 96&amp;nbsp;nm. Since electrons are much smaller, their average distance between colliding with molecules is about 5.6 times longer, or about 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm. This is a substantial fraction of the 7.5&amp;nbsp;µm spacing between the electrodes for minimal arc voltage. If the electron is in an electric field of 43&amp;nbsp;MV/m, it will be accelerated and acquire 21.5&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] of energy in 0.5&amp;nbsp;µm of travel in the direction of the field. The first [[ionization energy]] needed to dislodge an electron from [[nitrogen]] molecule is about 15.6&amp;nbsp;eV. The accelerated electron will acquire more than enough energy to ionize a nitrogen molecule. This liberated electron will in turn be accelerated, which will lead to another collision. A [[chain reaction]] then leads to [[Townsend discharge|avalanche breakdown]], and an arc takes place from the cascade of released electrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/tk/370/jcalvert/dischg.htm.html Electrical Discharges-How the spark, glow and arc work].&lt;/ref&gt;

More collisions will take place in the electron path between the electrodes in a higher-pressure gas. When the pressure–gap product &lt;math&gt;pd&lt;/math&gt; is high, an electron will collide with many different gas molecules as it travels from the cathode to the anode. Each of the collisions randomizes the electron direction, so the electron is not always being accelerated by the [[electric field]]—sometimes it travels back towards the cathode and is decelerated by the field.

Collisions reduce the electron's energy and make it more difficult for it to ionize a molecule. Energy losses from a greater number of collisions require larger voltages for the electrons to accumulate sufficient energy to ionize many gas molecules, which is required to produce an [[electron avalanche|avalanche breakdown]].

On the left side of the Paschen minimum, the &lt;math&gt;pd&lt;/math&gt; product is small. The electron mean free path can become long compared to the gap between the electrodes. In this case, the electrons might gain lots of energy, but have fewer ionizing collisions. A greater voltage is therefore required to assure ionization of enough gas molecules to start an avalanche.

== Derivation ==

=== Basics ===
To calculate the breakthrough voltage, a homogeneous electrical field is assumed. This is the case in a parallel-plate [[capacitor]] setup. The electrodes may have the distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. The cathode is located at the point &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

To get [[impact ionization]], the electron energy &lt;math&gt;E_e&lt;/math&gt; must become greater than the ionization energy &lt;math&gt;E_\text{I}&lt;/math&gt; of the gas atoms between the plates. Per length of path &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; a number of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ionizations will occur. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is known as the first Townsend coefficient as it was introduced by Townsend&lt;ref&gt;J. Townsend, [The Theory of Ionization of Gases by Collision http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/8460026]. Constable, 1910. Section 17.&lt;/ref&gt;. The increase of the electron current &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_e&lt;/math&gt;, can be described for the assumed setup as

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_e(x = d) = \Gamma_e(x = 0)\,e^{\alpha d}. \qquad\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;

(So the number of free electrons at the anode is equal to the number of free electrons at the cathode that were multiplied by impact ionization. The larger &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and/or &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the more free electrons are created.)

The number of created electrons is

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_e(d) - \Gamma_e(0) = \Gamma_e(0) \left(e^{\alpha d} - 1\right). \qquad\qquad(2)&lt;/math&gt;

Neglecting possible multiple ionizations of the same atom, the number of created ions is the same as the number of created electrons:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i(0) - \Gamma_i(d) = \Gamma_e(0) \left(e^{\alpha d} - 1\right). \qquad\qquad(3)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ion current. To keep the discharge going on, free electrons must be created at the cathode surface. This is possible because the ions hitting the cathode release [[secondary electrons]] at the impact. (For very large applied voltages also [[field electron emission]] can occur.) Without field emission, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_e(0) = \gamma \Gamma_i(0), \qquad\qquad (4)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the mean number of generated secondary electrons per ion. This is also known as the second Townsend coefficient. Assuming that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i(d) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, one gets the relation between the Townsend coefficients by putting (4) into (3) and transforming:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha d = \ln\left(1 + \frac{1}{\gamma}\right). \qquad\qquad(5)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Impact ionization ===
What is the amount of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;? The number of ionization depends upon the probability that an electron hits a gas molecule.  This probability &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the relation of the [[Cross section (physics)|cross-sectional]] area of a collision between electron and ion &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; in relation to the overall area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; that is available for the electron to fly through:

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{N\sigma}{A} = \frac{x}{\lambda}\qquad\qquad(6)&lt;/math&gt;

As expressed by the second part of the equation, it is also possible to express the probability as relation of the path traveled by the electron &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the [[mean free path]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; (distance at which another collision occurs).

[[File:Wirkungsquerschnitt-Skizze.svg|200px|thumb|right|Visualization of the cross-section &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;: If the center of particle ''b'' penetrates the blue circle, a collision occurs with particle ''a''.  So the area of the circle is the cross-section and its radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the radii of the particles.]]

&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules which electrons can hit.  It can be calculated using the equation of state of the [[ideal gas]]

:&lt;math&gt;pV=Nk_{B}T\qquad\qquad(7)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;(&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;: pressure, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;: volume, &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt;: [[Boltzmann constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;: temperature)&lt;/small&gt;

The adjoining sketch illustrates that &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi (r_a + r_b)^2&lt;/math&gt;.  As the radius of an electron can be neglected compared to the radius of an ion &lt;math&gt;r_I&lt;/math&gt; it simplifies to &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi r_I^2&lt;/math&gt;. Using this relation, putting (7) into (6) and transforming to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; one gets

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{k_{B}T}{p\pi r_{I}^{2}}=\frac{1}{L\cdot p}\qquad\qquad(8)&lt;/math&gt;

where the factor &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; was only introduced for a better overview.

The alteration of the current of not yet collided electrons at every point in the path &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\Gamma_e(x) = -\Gamma_e(x)\,\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\lambda_e}\qquad\qquad(9)&lt;/math&gt;

This differential equation can easily be solved:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_e(x) = \Gamma_e(0)\,\exp{\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_e}\right)}\qquad\qquad(10)&lt;/math&gt;

The probability that &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; x&lt;/math&gt; (that there was not yet a collision at the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;P(\lambda &gt; x) = \frac{\Gamma_e(x)}{\Gamma_e(0)} = \exp{\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_e}\right)}\qquad\qquad(11)&lt;/math&gt;

According to its definition &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the number of ionizations per length of path and thus the relation of the probability that there was no collision in the mean free path of the ions, and the mean free path of the electrons:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{P(\lambda &gt; \lambda_I)}{\lambda_e} = \frac{1}{\lambda_e}\exp\left(\mbox{-}\frac{\lambda_{I}}{\lambda_{e}}\right) = \frac{1}{\lambda_e}\exp\left(\mbox{-}\frac{E_{I}}{E_{e}}\right)\qquad\qquad(12)&lt;/math&gt;

It was hereby considered that the energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; that a charged particle can get between a collision depends on the [[electric field]] strength &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; and the charge &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \lambda Q\mathcal{E}\qquad\qquad(13)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Breakdown voltage ===
For the parallel-plate capacitor we have &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = \frac{U}{d}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the applied voltage. As a single ionization was assumed &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]] &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. We can now put (13) and (8) into (12) and get

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=L\cdot p\,\exp\left(\mbox{-}\frac{L\cdot p\cdot d\cdot E_{I}}{eU}\right)\qquad\qquad(14)&lt;/math&gt;

Putting this into (5) and transforming to &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; we get the Paschen law for the breakdown voltage &lt;math&gt;U_{\mathrm{breakdown}}&lt;/math&gt; that was first investigated by Paschen in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paschen | first1 = F. | year = 1889 | title = Ueber die zum Funkenübergang in Luft, Wasserstoff und Kohlensäure bei verschiedenen Drucken erforderliche Potentialdifferenz | url = | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 273 | issue = 5| pages = 69–96 | doi = 10.1002/andp.18892730505 | bibcode=1889AnP...273...69P| hdl = 2027/uc1.$b624756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and whose formula was first derived by Townsend in,&lt;ref&gt;J. Townsend, Electricity in Gases. Clarendon Press, 1915. Online: http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/4294747&lt;/ref&gt; section 227:

:&lt;math&gt;U_{\mathrm{breakdown}}=\frac{L\cdot p\cdot d\cdot E_{I}}{e\left(\ln(L\cdot p\cdot d)-\ln\left(\ln\left(1+\gamma^{-1}\right)\right)\right)}\qquad\qquad(15)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;with&lt;/small&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle L=\frac{\pi r_{I}^{2}}{k_{B}T}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Plasma ignition ===
[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma ignition]] in definition of Townsend ([[Townsend discharge]]) is a self-sustaining discharge, independent of an external source of free electrons. This means that electrons from the cathode can reach the anode in the distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and ionize at least one atom on their way. So according to the definition of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; this relation must be fulfilled:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha d\ge1\qquad\qquad(16)&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha d = 1&lt;/math&gt; is used instead of (5) one gets for the breakdown voltage

:&lt;math&gt;U_{\mathrm{breakdown\,Townsend}} = \frac{L\cdot p\cdot d\cdot E_{I}}{e\cdot \ln(L\cdot p\cdot d)} = \frac{d\cdot E_{I}}{e\cdot \lambda_e\,\ln\left(\frac{d}{\lambda_e}\right)}\qquad\qquad(17)&lt;/math&gt;

== Conclusions, validity ==
Paschen's law requires that:
* There are already free electrons at the cathode (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_e(x=0) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;) which can be accelerated to trigger impact ionization. Such so-called ''seed electrons'' can be created by ionization by cosmic [[x-ray background]].
* The creation of further free electrons is only achieved by impact ionization. Thus Paschen's law is not valid if there are external electron sources. This can, for example, be a light source creating secondary electrons by the [[photoelectric effect]]. This has to be considered in experiments.
* Each ionized atom leads to only one free electron. However, multiple ionizations occur always in practice.
* Free electrons at the cathode surface are created by the impacting ions. The problem is that the number of thereby created electrons strongly depends on the material of the cathode, its surface ([[Surface roughness|roughness]], impurities) and the environmental conditions (temperature, [[humidity]] etc.). The experimental, reproducible determination of the factor &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is therefore nearly impossible.
* The electrical field is homogeneous.

==Effects with different gases==
Different gases will have different mean free paths for molecules and electrons.  This is because different molecules have different diameters.  Noble gases like helium and argon are [[Monatomic gas|monatomic]] and tend to have smaller diameters.  This gives them greater mean free paths.

Ionization potentials differ between molecules, as well as the speed that they recapture electrons after they have been knocked out of orbit.  All three effects change the number of collisions needed to cause an exponential growth in free electrons.  These free electrons are necessary to cause an arc.

[[File:Minimovers-piano-removalists-2.JPG|thumb|The trolly can be used to carry piano's over steps. Here they are moving a baby grand piano over steps.]]

A '''piano trolley''' is a two- or four-wheeled trolley approximately 50cm to 80cm long used by [[Moving company|removals]] companies for moving pianos.  It is placed under the centre of mass of the [[piano]] and allows it to be turned on its axis to manoeuvre round a building.  By placing the trolley at one end of the instrument, stairs may be negotiated. In tight spaces the piano may be turned on end and rested on the trolley.

Typical features include solid rubber tyres, very strong construction, and thick rubber bumpers along the top and on the ends.

Before a piano trolley can be used to move a [[grand piano]], the piano must be protected by a [[piano shoe]], a wooden frame which protects the polished surface and provides additional strength for the sides.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10135">'''Polyanhydrides''' are a class of [[biodegradable]] [[polymer]]s characterized by [[anhydride]] bonds that connect [[repeat unit]]s of the polymer [[backbone chain]]. Their main application is in the medical device and pharmaceutical industry. [[In vivo]], polyanhydrides degrade into non-toxic diacid [[monomers]] that can be metabolized and eliminated from the body.  Owing to their safe degradation products, polyanhydrides are considered to be biocompatible.  

== Applications ==
The characteristic [[anhydride]] bonds in polyanhydrides are water-labile (the polymer chain breaks apart at the anhydride bond).  This results in two carboxylic acid groups which are easily [[metabolized]] and [[biocompatible]].  
[[Biodegradable]] [[polymers]], such as polyanhydrides, are capable of releasing physically entrapped or encapsulated drugs by well-defined kinetics and are a growing area of medical research.  Polyanhydrides have been investigated as an important material for the short-term release of drugs or [[Biological activity|bioactive]] agents.  The rapid degradation and limited mechanical properties of polyanhydrides render them ideal as controlled [[drug delivery]] devices.  

One example, Gliadel[http://www.gliadel.com], is a device in clinical use for the treatment of [[brain cancer]].  This product is made of a polyanhydride wafer containing a chemotherapeutic agent.  After removal of a [[cancerous]] [[brain tumor]], the wafer is inserted into the brain releasing a [[chemotherapy]] agent at a controlled rate proportional to the degradation rate of the [[polymer]].   The localized treatment of [[chemotherapy]] protects the [[immune system]] from high levels of [[radiation]].   

Other applications of polyanhydrides include the use of [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] polyanhydrides in bone replacement, as well as polyanhydride copolymers as vehicles for [[vaccine]] delivery.

== Classes ==
[[Image:polyanhydride structure.svg|thumb|300px|right|The structure of a polyanhydride molecule with ''n'' repeating units.]]
There are three main classes of polyanhydrides: aliphatic, unsaturated, and aromatic.  These classes are determined by examining their R groups (the chemistry of the molecule between the [[anhydride]] bonds).  

[[Aliphatic]] polyanhydrides consist of R groups containing [[carbon]] atoms bonded in straight or branched chains.  This class of [[polymers]] is characterized by a crystalline structure, melting temperature range of 50–90&amp;nbsp;°C, and solubility in chlorinated hydrocarbons.  They [[Chemical decomposition|degrade]] and are eliminated from the body within weeks of being introduced to the bodily environment.  

[[saturation (chemistry)|Unsaturated]] polyanhydrides consist of [[Organic chemistry|organic]] R groups with one or more double bonds (or [[degrees of unsaturation]]).  This class of [[polymers]] has a highly crystalline structure and is insoluble in common organic solvents.  

[[Aromatic]] polyanhydrides consist of R groups containing a [[benzene]] (aromatic) ring.  Properties of this class include a crystalline structure, insolubility in common organic solvents, and melting points greater than 100&amp;nbsp;°C.  They are very [[hydrophobic]] and therefore degrade slowly when in the bodily environment.  This slow [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] rate makes [[aromatic]] polyanhydrides less suitable for drug delivery when used as homopolymers, but they can be copolymerized with the [[aliphatic]] class to achieve the desired degradation rate.

==Synthesis and characterization== 
Polyanhydrides are synthesized using either melt condensation or solution polymerization.  Depending on the synthesis method used,
various characteristics of polyanhydrides can be altered to achieve the desired product.  Characterization of polyanhydrides determines the structure, composition, molecular weight, and thermal properties of the molecule.  These properties are determined by using various light-scattering and size-exclusion methods.  

===Polymerization===
Polyanhydrides can be easily prepared by using available, low cost resources.  The process can be varied to achieve desirable characteristics.  Traditionally, polyanhydrides have been prepared by melt condensation polymerization, which results in high [[molecular weight]] polymers.  Melt condensation polymerization involves reacting [[dicarboxylic acid]] monomers with excess [[acetic anhydride]] at a high temperature and under a vacuum to form the polymers. [[Catalysts]] may be used to achieve higher molecular weights and shorter reaction times.   Generally, a one-step synthesis (method involving only one reaction) is used which does not require purification.  

There are many other methods used to synthesize polyanhydrides.  Some of the other methods include: microwave heating, high-throughput synthesis (synthesis of polymers in parallel), ring opening polymerization (removal of cyclic monomers), interfacial condensation (high temperature reaction of two monomers), dehydrative coupling agents (removing the water group from two carboxyl groups), and solution polymerization (reacting in a solution).

===Chemical structure and composition analysis===
The [[chemical structure]] and composition of polyanhydrides can be determined by H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;[[NMR]] [[spectroscopy]].  This will determine the class of polanhydride (aromatic, aliphatic, or unsaturated) as well as the structural features of the [[polymer]].  For example, the analysis of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]([[NMR]]) peaks allows one to determine if a copolymer has a random or block-like structure.  [[Molecular weight]] and degradation rate can also determined by [[NMR]].  

===Molecular weight analysis===
Aside from using [[NMR]] to determine a polyanhydride’s molecular weight, [[gel permeation chromatography]] (GPC), and [[viscosity]] measurements may also be used.   

===Thermal properties===
[[Differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC) is used to determine the thermal properties of polyanhydrides.  Glass transition temperature, melting temperature, and [[heat of fusion]] can all be determined by DSC. Crystallinity of a polyanhydride can  be determined using DSC, [[Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), and [[X-ray diffraction]].

==Degradation==
[[Image:bulk vs surface erosion.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Comparison of bulk and surface erosion mechanisms.]]
The erosion and degradation of a [[polymer]] describe how the polymer physically loses mass ([[Chemical decomposition|degrade]]s).  The two common erosion mechanisms are [[surface and bulk erosion]].  Polyanhydrides are surface eroding polymers.  Surface eroding polymers do not allow water to penetrate into the material.  They erode layer by layer, like a lollipop.  The [[hydrophobic]] backbone with hydrolytically labile anhydride linkages allows [[hydrolytic]] degradation to be controlled by manipulating the [[polymer]] composition.  This manipulation can occur by adding a [[hydrophilic]] group to the polyanhydride to make a copolymer.  Polyanhydride copolymers with [[hydrophilic]] groups exhibit bulk eroding characteristics.  Bulk eroding polymers take in water like a sponge (throughout the material) and erode inside and on the surface of the polymer.   

Drug release from bulk eroding [[polymers]] is difficult to characterize because the primary mode of release from these polymers is [[diffusion]].  Unlike surface eroding polymers, bulk eroding polymers show a very weak relationship between the rate of polymer degradation and the rate of drug release.  Therefore, the development of surface eroding polyanhydrides incorporated into the bulk eroding polymers is of increased importance.

==Biocompatibility==
[[Biocompatibility]] and [[toxicity]] of a polymeric material is evaluated by examining [[:wikt:systemic|systemic]] [[toxic]] responses, local [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] responses, [[carcinogenic]] and [[mutagenic]] responses, and [[allergic]] responses to the material's degradation products.  Animal studies are conducted to test the polymer’s effect on each of these negative responses.  Polyanhydrides and their degradation products have not been found to cause significant harmful responses and are considered to be [[biocompatible]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8105">In [[aircraft design process|aircraft]] and rocket design, '''overall propulsive efficiency''' &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency with which the energy contained in a vehicle's [[propellant]] is converted into kinetic energy of the vehicle, to accelerate it, or to replace losses due to [[aerodynamic drag]] or gravity. It can also be described as the proportion of the [[mechanical energy]] actually used to propel the aircraft. It is always less than one, because [[conservation of momentum]] requires that the exhaust have some of the kinetic energy, and the propulsive mechanism (whether propeller, jet exhaust, or ducted fan) is never perfectly efficient. Overall propulsive efficiency is greatly dependent on [[air density]] and airspeed.

Mathematically, it is represented as &lt;math&gt;\eta = \eta_c \eta_p&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm ch10-3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\eta_c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cycle efficiency]] and &lt;math&gt;\eta_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mechanical efficiency]].

==Cycle efficiency==
{{main|Heat engine#Efficiency}}
Most aerospace vehicles are propelled by heat engines of some kind, usually an internal combustion engine. The efficiency of a heat engine relates how much useful work is output for a given amount of heat energy input.

From the laws of [[thermodynamics]]:

::&lt;math&gt; dW \ = \ dQ_c \ - \ (-dQ_h) &lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt; dW = -PdV &lt;/math&gt; is the work extracted from the engine. (It is negative because work is done ''by'' the engine.)
::&lt;math&gt; dQ_h = T_hdS_h &lt;/math&gt; is the heat energy taken from the high-temperature system (heat source). (It is negative because heat is extracted from the source, hence &lt;math&gt;(-dQ_h)&lt;/math&gt; is positive.)
::&lt;math&gt; dQ_c = T_cdS_c &lt;/math&gt; is the heat energy delivered to the low-temperature system (heat sink). (It is positive because heat is added to the sink.)

In other words, a heat engine absorbs heat from some heat source, converting part of it to useful work, and delivering the rest to a heat sink at lower temperature. In an engine, efficiency is defined as the ratio of useful work done to energy expended.

::&lt;math&gt;\eta_c = \frac{-dW}{-dQ_h} = \frac{-dQ_h - dQ_c}{-dQ_h} = 1 - \frac{dQ_c}{-dQ_h}&lt;/math&gt;

The theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine, the [[Carnot efficiency]], depends only on its operating temperatures. Mathematically, this is because in [[Thermodynamic reversibility|reversible]] processes, the cold reservoir would gain the same amount of [[entropy]] as that lost by the hot reservoir (i.e., &lt;math&gt;dS_c = -dS_h&lt;/math&gt;), for no change in entropy. Thus:

::&lt;math&gt;\eta_\text{cmax} = 1 - \frac{T_cdS_c}{-T_hdS_h} = 1 - \frac{T_c}{T_h}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]] of the hot source and &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; that of the cold sink, usually measured in [[kelvin]]s. Note that &lt;math&gt;dS_c&lt;/math&gt; is positive while &lt;math&gt;dS_h&lt;/math&gt; is negative; in any reversible work-extracting process, entropy is overall not increased, but rather is moved from a hot (high-entropy) system to a cold (low-entropy one), decreasing the entropy of the heat source and increasing that of the heat sink.

==Mechanical efficiency==
Conservation of momentum requires acceleration of propellant material in the opposite direction to accelerate a vehicle. In general, energy efficiency is highest when the exhaust velocity is low, in the frame of reference of the Earth, as this reduces loss of kinetic energy to propellant.

===Jet engines===

[[Image:JetWirkungsgrad.png|thumb|right|Dependence of the energy efficiency (η) from the exhaust speed/airplane speed ratio (c/v) for airbreathing jets]] 
The exact propulsive efficiency formula for air-breathing engines is &lt;ref&gt;K.Honicke, R.Lindner, P.Anders, M.Krahl, H.Hadrich, K.Rohricht. Beschreibung der Konstruktion der Triebwerksanlagen. Interflug, Berlin, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spt&gt;Spittle, Peter. [http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~kadem/Rolls%20Royce.pdf "Gas turbine technology"] p507, ''[[Rolls-Royce plc]]'', 2003. Retrieved: 21 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_p = \frac{2}{1 + \frac{v_9}{v_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_9&lt;/math&gt; is the exhaust expulsion velocity and &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; is the airspeed of the aircraft.

A corollary of this is that, particularly in air breathing engines, it is more energy efficient to accelerate a large amount of air by a small amount, than it is to accelerate a small amount of air by a large amount, even though the thrust is the same. This is why [[turbofan engines]] are more efficient than simple jet engines at subsonic speeds.

[[File:Propulsive efficiency.png|thumb|right|Dependence of the propulsive efficiency (&lt;math&gt;\eta_p&lt;/math&gt;) upon the vehicle speed/exhaust speed ratio (v_0/v_9) for rocket and jet engines]]

===Rocket engines===
A rocket engine's &lt;math&gt;\eta_c&lt;/math&gt; is usually high due to the high combustion temperatures and pressures, and the long converging-diverging nozzle used. It varies slightly with altitude due to changing atmospheric pressure, but can be up to 70%. Most of the remainder is lost as heat in the exhaust.

Rocket engines have a slightly different propulsive efficiency (&lt;math&gt;\eta_p&lt;/math&gt;) than air-breathing jet engines, as the lack of intake air changes the form of the equation. This also allows rockets to exceed their exhaust's velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_p= \frac {2 \frac {v_0} {v_9}} {1 + ( \frac {v_0} {v_9} )^2 }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="RPE"&gt;George P. Sutton &amp; Oscar Biblarz, ''Rocket Propulsion Elements'', pg 37-38 (seventh edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to jet engines, matching the exhaust speed and the vehicle speed gives optimum efficiency, in theory. However, in practice, this results in a very low [[specific impulse]], causing much greater losses due to the need for [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation|exponentially]] larger masses of propellant. Unlike ducted engines, rockets give thrust even when the two speeds are equal.

In 1903, [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] discussed the average propulsive efficiency of a rocket, which he called the utilization (''utilizatsiya''), the "portion of the total work of the explosive material transferred to the rocket" as opposed to the exhaust gas.&lt;ref&gt;"Study of Outer Space by Jet Drives", Nauchnoe Obozrenie, May 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propeller engines===
[[File:Gas turbine efficiency.png|thumb|Propulsive efficiency comparison for various gas turbine engine configurations]]

The calculation is somewhat different for reciprocating and [[turboprop]] engines which rely on a propeller for propulsion since their output is typically expressed in terms of power rather than thrust. The equation for heat added per unit time, ''Q'', can be adopted as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;550 P_e = \frac{\eta_c H h J}{3600},&lt;/math&gt;

where H = calorific value of the fuel in BTU/lb, h = fuel consumption rate in lb/hr and J = mechanical equivalent of heat = 778.24&amp;nbsp;ft.lb/BTU, where &lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt; is engine output in [[horsepower]], converted to foot-pounds/second by multiplication by 550. Given that [[specific fuel consumption (shaft engine)|specific fuel consumption]] is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''P''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; and H = 20 052 BTU/lb for gasoline, the equation is simplified to:

: &lt;math&gt;\eta_c (\%age) = \frac{12.69}{C_p}.&lt;/math&gt;

expressed as a percentage.

Assuming a typical propulsive efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_p&lt;/math&gt; of 86% (for the optimal airspeed and air density conditions for the given propeller design{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}), maximum overall propulsive efficiency is estimated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{10.91}{C_p}.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''pyramid puzzle''' is a [[mechanical puzzle]] (''assembly puzzle'') consisting of two or more component pieces which fit together to create a pyramid.

==History==
''Unknown origin''. Children of American pioneers played with simple toys such as these.



==Solutions==
* Two-piece pyramid puzzles: A regular pyramid is not possible in this case. Instead, we can only form a 4 faced tetrahedron pyramid.
To do this, make the square faces face each other and twist one upright to complete the four faced tetrahedronic pyramid.
* Four-piece pyramid puzzles: Join the four identical pieces in pairs so that the smallest triangular faces meet. Turn the squares to face each other and bring them together. This will leave a square face on the two resulting pieces. With the square sides of the blocks facing each other, twist one piece upright to complete the pyramid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">'''Rapid phase transition''' or '''RPT''' is a phenomenon realized in [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) incidents in which LNG vaporizes violently upon coming in contact with [[water]] causing what is known as a ''physical explosion''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iomosaic.com/docs/training/Understand_LNG_RPT.pdf Understand LNG Rapid Phase Transitions (RPT)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828015033/http://www.iomosaic.com/docs/training/Understand_LNG_RPT.pdf |date=2013-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or ''cold explosion''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/15490436/Lng-Hazard-AP Lng Hazard AP]&lt;/ref&gt; During such explosions there is no combustion but rather a huge amount of [[energy]] is transferred in the form of heat from the room-temperature water to the LNG at a [[temperature]] difference of about 175 kelvins.

==LNG Properties==
{{Main|Liquefied natural gas}}
[[Liquefied natural gas]] or LNG is a natural gas that gets liquefied at atmospheric pressure and −161.5&amp;nbsp;°C. It is [[odorless]], [[tasteless]], colorless, and not [[poisonous]] but causes [[asphyxia]]. It can cause [[frostbite]] due to its [[cryogenic]] temperature. If this extremely cold LNG is mixed with water(e.g. [[sea water]], which has an average temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;°C), heat energy is transferred from the water to the LNG, rapidly [[Vaporization|vaporizing]] it from its liquefied state back into its original gaseous state. This results in an explosion because the volume occupied by natural gas in its gaseous form is 600 times greater than when its liquefied. This is the phenomenon of rapid phase transition.

'''Saint Volodymyr Descent''' ({{lang-uk|Володимирський узвіз}}, Volodymyrsky uzviz) is a street in [[Kiev]] located between the [[Pechersk Raion|Pechersk]] and [[Podil Raion|Podil]] city districts. It stretches from [[European Square (Kiev)|European Square]] to [[Postal Square (Kiev)|Postal Square]]. 

The city street splits two city parks ([[Khreshchaty Park]] and [[Saint Volodymyr Hill]]) located on the slopes of Saint Michael Hill (see [[Kiev Mountains]]).

The street started to form in 1711 in place of the so-called ''Old Pechersk Road'' that used to connect Pechersk with Podil. As a city street it was known originally as ''Khreshchaty Drive'' ({{lang-uk|Хрещатицький приїзд}}, Khreshchatytsky pryizd) and later as ''Paved Street'' ({{lang-uk|Мостова вулиця}}, Mostova vulytsia) becoming the first city's street paved with [[cobblestone]]. Sometime in 1810s it became part of a long ''Aleksandr Street'' (after [[Alexander II of Russia]]) that stretched all the way from Arsenal Square to Contracts Square, while the descent was unofficially referred to as Aleksandr Descent. After the occupation of Kiev by the Soviet troops in March of 1919 the long street was renamed as Revolution Street ([[October Revolution]]). When Kiev became the capital of the [[Soviet Ukraine]] in 1934, the street was renamed once again, now as Sergei Kirov Street after the Russian government official [[Sergei Kirov]]. During the Nazi occupation the street along with the modern Hrushevsky Street carried the name of the Nazi political figure [[Fritz Todt]].

During the [[World War II]] when Kiev was freed from Nazi occupation, the former long Kirov Street was split at the Stalin Square (today [[European Square (Kiev)|European Square]]) into Kirov Street (today [[Hrushevsky Street (Kiev)|Hrushevsky Street]]) and Volodymyr Descent that stretched from the Stalin Square to [[Contracts Square (Kiev)|Contracts Square]]. In 1955 the street was shortened and part of it between Postal Square and Contracts Square was renamed into Zhdanov Street (today Sahaidachny Street) after a Soviet official [[Andrei Zhdanov]].

'''Sudan Airways Flight 109''' was an international scheduled [[Amman]]–[[Damascus]]–[[Khartoum]] passenger service, operated with an [[Airbus A310]], that crashed on landing at [[Khartoum International Airport]] on 10 June 2008, approximately at 17:00 [[UTC]], killing 30 of 214 occupants on board.&lt;ref name="ASN"&gt;{{ASN accident|id= 20080610-0|accessdate= 5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dozens killed in Sudan air crash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/sudan.plane/index.html|title= Passenger plane crashes in flames in Sudan|accessdate= 10 June 2008|work= [[CNN]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611022323/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/10/sudan.plane/index.html|archivedate= 11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft involved in the accident was an [[Airbus A310-300|Airbus A310-324]], [[Serial number|c/n]] 548, [[Aircraft registration|tail number]] {{Airreg|ST|ATN|,}} that had its maiden flight on 23 August 1990 as F-WWCV.&lt;ref name="Airfleets"&gt;{{cite web|title= Airbus A310 MSN 548|url= http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-a310-548.htm|work= AirFleets.net|accessdate= 25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipped with a twin-[[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000|PW4152]] powerplant, it was delivered new to [[Singapore Airlines]] on 22 October 1990 and [[Aircraft registration|register]]ed 9V-STU.&lt;ref name="Airfleets"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Accident information : Airbus A310 Sudan Airways ST-ATN|url= http://www.airfleets.net/crash/crash_report_SudanAirways_ST-ATN.htm|work= Airfleets.net|accessdate= 25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-registered VT-EVF, it was delivered to [[Air India]] on 10 March 2001.&lt;ref name="Airfleets"/&gt; The aircraft was finally registered ST-ATN, and delivered to [[Sudan Airways]] on 1 December 2007.&lt;ref name="Airfleets"/&gt; According to [[Airbus]], it had accumulated 52,000 flight hours and 21,000 cycles.&lt;ref name="Sudan A310 veered off runway during landing" /&gt;

==Description==
The flight originated in Amman and had its final destination in Khartoum with an intermediate stop in Damascus. The presence of a sandstorm and heavy rain prevented the aircraft to land at Khartoum and forced it to be diverted to [[Port Sudan]]. The aircraft was later allowed to fly back to its original destination.&lt;ref name="Dozens die in Sudan jet inferno" /&gt; The flight landed at Khartoum Airport at 17:26&amp;nbsp;UTC, but was not able to stop within the paved area. Following the aircraft overrunning the runway and coming to rest {{convert|215|m}} beyond the end of runway 36 a fire erupted on the starboard side.&lt;ref name="Final report" /&gt;{{rp|8}} The slides on the side the fire started at could not be deployed; people on board evacuated the aircraft using the port side slides.&lt;ref name="Final report" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

==Cause==
The runway overrun was caused by a combination of a long landing flare, the wet runway, landing without autobrake selected on, and one engine thrust reverser that was deactivated.&lt;ref name="Final report" /&gt;{{rp|39}} The aircraft had been dispatched with the port engine thrust reverser deactivated. This condition caused it to veer to the right when the captain activated reverse thrust in both engines in order to stop the aircraft within {{convert|2080|m}} of runway left.&lt;ref name="Fatal Sudan A310 overrun crew unaware of tailwind" /&gt; Reports indicated the occurrence of a big sandstorm at Khartoum earlier that day that was followed by low visibility and heavy rain and winds at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name="14 still missing after air crash blaze" /&gt; Contributing to the long landing flare was that the crew had been incorrectly informed that they had a {{convert|7|kn|adj=on}} headwind for landing when they actually had a {{convert|15|kn|adj=on}} tailwind.&lt;ref name="Final report" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

==Casualties==

'''TAP Flight 425''' was a regular flight from [[Brussels]], Belgium, to [[Santa Catarina Airport]] (informally known as Funchal Airport or Madeira Airport;  now the [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] International Airport), Portugal, with an intermediate scheduled stop in [[Lisbon]]. On November 19, 1977, the [[Boeing 727]] operating the service overran the airport's runway before crashing onto the nearby beach and exploding, killing 131 of the 164 people on board. It remains [[TAP Portugal|TAP]]'s only fatal accident in its history.

== Aircraft ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2017}}
The aircraft operating flight TP-425 was a [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727-282 Advanced]] registration CS-TBR named after the Portuguese aviation pioneer [[Sacadura Cabral]]. Its manufacturer serial number was 20972/1096 and it was delivered to TAP on 21 January 1975. It was powered by 3 [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D|Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-17]] turbofan engines which had a maximum thrust of 16,000&amp;nbsp;lbf each. The aircraft had completed a B check on 21 September 1977, and at the time of the accident had accumulated 6,154 flying hours in 5,204 cycles.

== Accident ==
Shortly before 9:48pm on that Saturday evening, after 13 hours and 15 minutes of service time, the tired crew of the 727 was trying to land the airplane on the difficult Santa Catarina International Airport's runway, which at the time was {{convert|1600|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} long. After two unsuccessful attempts to land the aircraft, the [[Captain (civil aviation)|Captain]] João Lontrão and [[Co-pilot]] Miguel Guimarães Leal decided to make one last try to land the plane, before they would have to make the decision to divert to the [[Gran Canaria Airport]] in the [[Canary Islands]].{{CN|date=November 2016}}

While on final approach to runway 24 in heavy rain, strong winds and poor visibility, the aircraft touched down {{convert|2000|ft|sigfig=2}} past the threshold, and started hydroplaning. With just about {{convert|3000|ft|sigfig=2}} of runway left, the crew tried desperately to stop, applying maximum reverse thrust and brakes, but the aircraft slid off the runway with a ground speed of  approximately {{convert|43|kn|km/h}} and plunged over a {{convert|200|ft|adj=on}} steep bank hitting a nearby bridge and crashing on the beach; splitting in two pieces and bursting into flames.&lt;ref name=rtp&gt;[[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]] Documentary "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLROUDrMquU TP425 - O voo interminável]" (aired November 14th 2007, in Portuguese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 164 people aboard (156 passengers and eight crew), 131 were killed (125 passengers and 6 crew),&lt;ref name=airdisater&gt;[http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11191977%C2%AE=CS-TBR&amp;airline=TAP+Portugal AirDisaster.com Accident Database] listing for flight 425. Accessed 05/07/2008&lt;/ref&gt; making it the deadliest airplane accident in Portugal to that point. As of 2018, it is the second deadliest airplane accident in Portugal, after [[Independent Air Flight 1851]]. It remains TAP Portugal's only fatal accident since the beginning of its flight operations in 1946.&lt;ref name=onlyfatalaccident&gt;[http://www.airsafe.com/events/airlines/tap.htm AirSafe.com - TAP Air Portugal plane crashes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the accident occurred, TAP stopped flying the Boeing 727-200 to Madeira, and started flying only the 727-100, which was six metres shorter and took 60 fewer passengers.&lt;ref name=rtp/&gt;

The crash prompted officials to explore ways of extending the short runway. Because of the height of the runway relative to the beach below, an extension was very difficult and very expensive to perform.&lt;ref name=rtp/&gt; Between 1983 and 1986,&lt;ref name=aeromadeira82&gt;[http://www.aeroportosdamadeira.pt/1983-a-1986-42.aspx 1983-86 History of Madeira], the airport where flight 425 crashed. Accessed 20/02/2010   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218023306/http://www.aeroportosdamadeira.pt/1983-a-1986-42.aspx |date=December 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 200 meter extension was built; 14 years later,&lt;ref name=aeromadeira00&gt;[http://www.aeroportosdamadeira.pt/2000-43.aspx 2000 History of Madeira], the airport where flight 425 crashed.

Following the 2000 extension, the runway of what is now the Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport measures {{convert|2781|m|abbr=on}} long and is capable of handling wide-body commercial jets like the [[Boeing 747]] or the [[Airbus A340]].

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''Thiocarbonate''' describes a family of [[anion]]s with the general [[chemical formula]] {{chem|CS|3−''x''|O|''x''|2−}} (''x'' = 0, 1, or 2). Organic compounds structurally related to these anions are also called thiocarbonates.

Like the [[carbonate]] dianion, the thiocarbonates are [[plane (geometry)|planar]], with carbon at the center. The average [[bond order]] from C to S or O is {{frac|1|1|3}}. The state of protonation is usually not specified. These anions are good [[nucleophile]]s and good [[ligand]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monothiocarbonate==
Monothiocarbonate is the dianion CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, which has C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; [[symmetry group|symmetry]]. Monothiocarbonate arises by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[thiophosgene]] or the reaction of base with [[carbonyl sulfide]]:
:COS + 2 NaOH → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Dithiocarbonates==
Dithiocarbonate is the dianion {{chem|COS|2|2−}}, which has C&lt;sub&gt;2v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. It arises from the reaction of aqueous base with [[carbon disulfide]]:
:CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaOH → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Important derivatives dithiocarbonates are the [[xanthate]]s, with the formula {{chem|ROCS|2|−}}. These salts are typically prepared by the reaction of sodiium [[alkoxide]]s with carbon disulfide. Another group of dithiocarbonates have the formula (RS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthesis of 4,5-Dimethyl-1,3-dithiol-2-one|authors=Perumalreddy Chandrasekaran, James P. Donahue|journal=Org. Synth.|year=2009|volume=86|pages=333|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.086.0333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are often derived by hydrolysis of the corresponding trithiocarbonates (RS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS. One example is tetrathiapentalenedione, a [[heterocycle]] that consists of two dithiocarbonate groups.

==Trithiocarbonates==
Trithiocarbonate is the dianion {{chem|CS|3|2−}}, which has D&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. Trithiocarbonate is derived from the reaction of sulfide sources with carbon disulfide:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Org. Synth.|author = R. E. Strube | title = Trithiocarbodiglycolic Acid | volume = 39 | pages = 967 | year = 1959 | doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.039.0077}}(a procedure for synthesis of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
:CS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 [[Sodium hydrosulfide|NaSH]] → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S

==Perthiocarbonates==
Addition of sulfur to trithiocarbonate gives the perthiocarbonate anion {{chem|CS|4|2−}}, which contains one sulfur–sulfur bond.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=3034198 Sodium perthiocarbonate o PubChem]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Perthiocarbonic acid (or tetrathiocarbonic acid, CAS#13074-70-9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebuychem.com/product/13074-70-9.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607005338/http://www.ebuychem.com/product/13074-70-9.html |archivedate=2014-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) has never been synthesized in the pure form but only as a dark brown solution.&lt;ref&gt;http://sulphur.atomistry.com/perthiocarbonic_acid.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Treehouse attachment bolt'''s or '''TAB'''s are specialized bolts engineered for [[tree house|treehouse]] construction.&lt;ref name=the&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehouseengineering.com/ |title=""INTRODUCING THE XL SYSTEM ©- FINALLY, A TRUE TREE HOUSE MOUNTING SYSTEM"" (see the link to a brochure)|accessdate=2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Rheenen" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pequot&gt;Globe Pequot, "Knack Treehouses: A Step-by-Step Guide to Designing and Building a Safe and Sound Structure", 2010, {{ISBN|0762763426}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7eP3jOihyjgC&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66]&lt;/ref&gt;
Various models and trademarks exist, with names such as '''Garnier limbs''' (GLs); tree anchor bolts; artificial limbs; heavy limbs or hyper limbs (HLs); special tree fastener or stud tree fastener (STFs). 

They may be either of [[through fastener]] style (for smaller trees) or side mount type for larger ones.&lt;ref name=the/&gt;

==Description==
One of the main features of TABs is their strength, requiring fewer tree penetrations for robust fastening of a treehouse and hence less damage to a live tree. A typical TAB consists of a threaded metal bolt and a larger diameter collar. The latter provides an extra bending strength by bearing upon the compression strength of the tree grain.&lt;ref name=the/&gt; Since treehouses are subject to frequent load reversal produced by winds, TABs must be made of [[spring steel]]&lt;ref name=the/&gt; The bolts are able to support from between {{convert|9,000|and|12,000|lbs|kg}},&lt;ref name=Goodnow /&gt; a much greater load than conventional [[Screw#Lag screw|lag bolt]]s.

The concept of using a collar or large cylindrical object to increase shear strength in wood construction has been around for several centuries in the forms of split rings and shear plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehouseattachmentbolts.com/construction.html |title=History of the TAB |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Shear plates provide a larger load-carrying capacity in shear than can be otherwise achieved by a bolt alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shearplates.com/ |title=Information regarding shear plates |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because this idea utilized less bolts for equal strength, it transferred well into the use of live trees, as they compartmentalize more efficiently with a single, larger cut than several, smaller cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetreehouseguide.com/treedamage.htm#compartment |title=Live tree reactions to TABs |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Garnier became involved in treehouse construction&lt;ref name=Goodnow&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:SPIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=11B3A9A213E20EB0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46 | title=Northwest Innovators Helped Revolutionize Construction | publisher=''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' | date=23 August 2007 | accessdate=28 December 2013 | author=Goodnow, Cecilia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kugel&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:MIJB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FAA9D222C57A367&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46 | title=Refuge among the boughs | publisher=''Marin Independent Journal'' | date=26 April 2003 | accessdate=28 December 2013 | author=Kugel, Seth}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in 1990 when he built his first treehouse in [[Josephine County, Oregon|Josephine County]], [[Oregon]]. Two years later, he was ordered by County official to close the treehouse to the public. He began developing what would become the Garnier limb, a high-strength alloy steel engineered bolt that can be screwed into a bore in the trunk of tree. In 1997 Garnier met Arborist Scott D. Baker who shared his knowledge of tree biology and tree structural responses. By 1998, Garnier had developed a commercial bolt product which he called Artificial Limbs. The Garnier limb was primarily developed to satisfy the safety requirements of the Josephine County Building and Safety [[Construction permit|building permit]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miskimon|first=Robert|title=The Complete Guide to Building Your Own Tree House: For Parents and Adults Who Are Kids at Heart|year=2008|publisher=Atlantic Publishing Company|isbn=1-60138-244-8|pages=88–89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ynNOj4660UC&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=garnier%20limb&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q=garnier%20limb&amp;f=false|author2=Chmienlnicki, Steven |accessdate=29 July 2011|quote=[Michael Garnier's] battle with Josephine County officials in Oregon began when he built his first tree house, Peacock Perch, in 1990.

'''''Twisted House''''' is a public artwork by [[United States|American]] artist [[John McNaughton (sculptor)|John McNaughton]], located at the [[Indianapolis Art Center]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Stender"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stender|first=Thomas W.|title=The Penland Book of Woodworking: Master Classes in Woodworking Technique|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dUkZcqBLFIC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22Twisted+House%22+indianapolis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG6aSIs4rbAhUO2GMKHQ_oDHoQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Twisted%20House%22%20indianapolis&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=1579907687|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Twisted House'' was installed as part of the Center's ARTSPARK initiative.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARK"&gt;{{cite web | author=Indianapolis Art Center | year=2009 | title=ARTSPARK Sculptures | work=ARTSPARK | publisher=Indianapolis Art Center | url=http://www.indplsartcenter.org/userfiles/File/ARTSPARK_harndout_0209.pdf | accessdate=8 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925191145/http://indplsartcenter.org/userfiles/File/ARTSPARK_harndout_0209.pdf | archivedate=25 September 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The sculpture is made of [[cedar wood]] and depicts a tall house, bent in such a way that it appears to rest on its foundation and roof.&lt;ref name="Rush"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/354022472/?terms=%22Twisted+House%22|title=Interact With Art|last=Rush|first=Gretchen|date=August 12, 2005|work=The Noblesville Ledger|page=A7|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roof of the house digs into the forest floor and five square, glass windows travel upwards on the house and a distorted door juts to the right, open for viewers to interact with—inside one can step and look out a large window looking out into the forest. The windows each have sills with exterior flower holders and fake wood flowers. The piece sits on natural stone placed in the ground and the dirt of the forest grounds.

==John McNaughton==

John McNaughton has been teaching [[woodworking]], drawing and sculpture for over 35 years at the [[University of Southern Indiana]]. Receiving his Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts at [[Ball State University]] and his Master of Fine Arts at [[Bowling Green State University]], he has been awarded two [[National Endowment for the Arts]] awards. His art furniture and sculptures reside in the collections of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] and the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="indyartsguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indyartsguide.org/public-art/twisted-house/|title=Twisted House|work=Indyartsguide|publisher=The Arts Council of Indianapolis|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==

This piece was placed in conjunction with the Center's ARTSPARK which brings together art and nature.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARK"/&gt;

==Information==

According to the Indianapolis Art Center, McNaughton's goal with the work is to show viewers that sculpture can be interactive and touch heavily into the imagination.&lt;ref name="Tour"&gt;{{cite web | author=Indianapolis Art Center | year=2008 | title=Twisted House  | work= | publisher=YouTube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UWrMsyUMdQ | accessdate= 8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in June 2010 IAC hosted a "Community Masterpiece" event designed by artist [[Vandra Pentecost]].&lt;ref name="Kightlinger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/126260632/?terms=%22Twisted+House%22|title=Talk of Our Town|last=Kightlinger|first=Cathy|date=July 4, 2010|work=The Indianapolis Star|page=I6|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural consists of seven panels with each one depicting ''Twisted House'' in a different artistic style: [[expressionism]], [[Realism (arts)|realism]], [[surrealism]], [[American scene painting]], [[cubism]], [[pop art]] and [[impressionism]]. The two panels for pop art and surrealism were completed at the [[Broad Ripple Art Fair]] by visitors. In July and August the rest of the panels were completed and the full [[mural]] now resides on the Outreach Lawn Wall of the ARTSPARK.&lt;ref name="Masterpiece"&gt;{{cite web | author=Indianapolis Art Center | year=2010 | title=Art Center’s Twisted House Gets a New Spin  | work=Blog | publisher=IAC | url=http://indplsartcenterblog.com/2010/06/28/art-centers-twisted-house-gets-a-new-spin/v=4UWrMsyUMdQ | accessdate= 8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[Doug Kirby|Roadside America]]'' describes ''Twisted House'' as "A work of whimsical lopsided outdoor art, suggesting something that's gone terribly wrong at a fairy tale theme park."&lt;ref name="RAMay"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indianapolis, IN - Artspark - Twisted House|url=https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/16252|website=Roadside America|accessdate=16 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
