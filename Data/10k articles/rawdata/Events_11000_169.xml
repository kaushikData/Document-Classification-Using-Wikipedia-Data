The '''13th World Science Fiction Convention''', also known as '''Clevention''', was held on September 2–5, 1955, at the Manger Hotel in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States.

&lt;!-- The supporting organization was the [[ORG]]. --&gt;The chairmen were Nick and Noreen Falasca.  The guests of honor were [[Isaac Asimov]] (pro) and [[Sam Moskowitz]] (mystery GoH). Total attendance was approximately 380.

This was the first convention at which the [[Hugo Award]]s were established as an annual feature; the first awards had been given out two years before, at [[Philcon II]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="hugo55"/&gt;

{{About-Hugos}}&lt;ref name="hugo55"/&gt;

The '''1936 Monaco Grand Prix''' was a [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] [[motor race]] held at [[Circuit de Monaco]] on 13 April 1936.

Heavy rain contributed to a series of accidents, while a broken oil line on the [[Alfa Romeo]] of [[Mario Tadini]] led to so many wrecks in the [[chicane]] out of the tunnel it was almost impassable.&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, Mike. "Monaco: Road Racing on the Riviera", in Northey, Tom, editor. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 12, pp.1382–1383.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes-Benz]]es of [[Louis Chiron]], [[Luigi Fagioli]], and [[Manfred von Brauchitsch]], as well as [[Bernd Rosemeyer]]'s ''Typ C'' of newcomer [[Auto Union racing car|Auto Union]], were all eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, p.1383.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tazio Nuvolari]] in the [[Alfa Romeo 8C]] benefitted from the chaos, only to suffer [[brake fade]], and [[Rudolf Caracciola]], proving the truth of his [[List of motorsports people by nickname#R|nickname]], ''Regenmeister'' (Rainmaster), went on to win for Mercedes. He was followed by [[Achille Varzi]] and [[Hans Stuck]], both for Auto Union.&lt;ref&gt;Kettlewell, p.1383.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Action Party''' ({{lang-it|Partito d'Azione}}) was an Italian pre-unitary [[political party]] active during the [[Risorgimento]].&lt;ref name=Treccani&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/partito-d-azione/|title=Partito d'Azione|work=Encilopedia Treccani}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first organized party in the [[history of Italy]].

== History ==
After the failure of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|Italian revolutions of 1848]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] was dissolved as a political organization to form the Italian National Association ({{lang-it|Associazione Nazionale Italiana}}), which was still led by Mazzini.

During the 1848–1849, the Italian National Association competed against the rival [[Moderate Party (Italy)|Moderate Party]] led by [[Vincenzo Gioberti]] and [[Massimo d'Azeglio]] that won the election in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and established a new government. After some years of weak activities, the Italian National Association was renamed in 1853 by Mazzini to the Action Party, which published the booklet-manifesto "To the Italians" (''Agli Italiani'')&lt;ref name=Italians&gt;{{cite book|first=Giuseppe|last=Mazzini|title=Agli italiani|pages=748–759|date=1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; and invited [[Italians]] to start various rebel and republican organizations. This tactic was changed after the failed invasion of [[Sapri]] of the same year, where [[Carlo Pisacane]] died.

In 1860, the Action Party financed the creation of a paramilitary group led by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] named the [[Redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]] (''Camicie rosse''). The Redshirts become particularly famous for the [[Expedition of the Thousand]], when Garibaldi conquered in a few months all of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] and the [[Papal States]]. In this period, the Action Party was strongly opposed to the Moderate Party and its new leader [[Camillo Benso di Cavour]], who was close to the [[House of Savoy]]. Mazzini particularly hated the annexation war, the falsification of the referendums and the Piedmontization of Italy that ignored the various diversities of a unified [[Italy]]. The Action Party founded the first mutual aid societies, workers' associations, public schools and cooperatives. In the 1861, Mazzini founded the newspaper of the Action Party, ''L'Unità italiana''. In 1867, the Action Party attempted to conclude the [[Unification War]] and take over [[Rome]] with the [[Battle of Mentana]], which failed. Disappointed, Mazzini dissolved the Action Party and retired from the politics. In 1870, Garibaldi [[Capture of Rome|captured Rome]], which became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

In 1877, [[Agostino Bertani]], a former member of the Action Party, left the [[Historical Left]] to form the [[Historical Far-Left]], reputed to be the real heir of the Action Party.

== Proposals and goals ==
* [[Unification of Italy]], including the "[[Italian irredentism|Irrident Lands]]".&lt;ref name=Italians/&gt;
* Abolition of the [[monarchy]] and creation of a [[republic]].
* Elections with [[universal suffrage]].

'''''Aurore''''' is a [[2005 in film|2005]] [[Quebec]] [[biographical]] [[drama]] movie that was directed by [[Luc Dionne]] and produced by [[Denise Robert]] and Daniel Louis. The movie is a remake of [[Jean-Yves Bigras]]'s 1952 movie ''[[Little Aurore's Tragedy|La petite Aurore: l'enfant martyre]] (Little Aurore: The Child Martyr)''.

==Synopsis==
Aurore Gagnon, born in 1909 to Marie-Anne Caron and Telesphore Gagnon, is the second child of the couple. During the first nine years of her life, Aurore enjoys a happy life.

Then, during the fall of 1917, Aurore's mother develops [[tuberculosis]]. She is brought to hospital for several months and doctors conclude she will never recover. Plans are made to give custody of Aurore and her sister Marie-Jeanne to Telesphore and his late wife's cousin, Marie-Anne Houde (often simply referred to as Telesphore's cousin in the movie), with whom he had fallen in love. During a visit to Marie-Anne Houde before she goes into hospital, Aurore's mother finds one of Marie-Anne's children locked inside a wooden structure. This alerts her that Marie-Anne might not treat her children well. At the same time, Aurore sees her father kissing Marie-Anne; the girl criticizes her father for not caring enough about his ill wife.

Aurore's mother dies in 1918, and Telesphore and Marie-Anne marry immediately after the funeral. This is the start of an unhappier, more difficult life for Aurore, as her [[stepmother]] and father begin at once to mistreat her. When two of Marie-Anne's children die, some villagers blame Houde for their deaths.

The situation soon becomes worse for Aurore. During Father Leduc's visit to her school, he asks her a question about religion and she tells him to lower his voice. Immediately, Telesphore and Marie-Anne are notified and the [[mistreatment]] becomes more and more brutal. Marie-Anne carries out most of the abuse by slapping Aurore, striking her feet with a [[Lumber#Dimensional lumber|2x4]] with nails, and burning her with a burning steel hook. Her father also abuses her by slapping her and striking her with an axe handle. She is also locked in an isolated room with little food. After the attack with the nails, Oreus, the peace judge of the town, forces her parents to send Aurore to hospital and suspects that she has been beaten. When Exilda Lemay (played by Francine Ruel), discovers Aurore with severe wounds all over her body, she immediately alerts Oreus about the situation. Oreus goes to Quebec to discuss the issue with a crown attorney.

When the peace judge and several others, including doctors, arrive at Aurore's home, it is too late: she collapsed on the stairs and was attacked again by Marie-Anne with a 2x4. Doctors are unable to save Aurore, who passes away from [[blood poisoning]].

After Aurore's funeral, the couple is arrested for Aurore's death. Telesphore is sentenced to [[life sentence|life in prison]] for [[manslaughter]]. His cousin and wife Marie-Anne is initially sentenced to [[death penalty|death]] by [[hanging]] for [[second degree murder]]. She is then given a life sentence, but health issues force her to leave the jail, and she later dies from breast and brain cancer. Father Leduc, whom Oreus blames for his lack of action on the case, kills himself with [[explosives]].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Carbon monoxide poisoning''' typically occurs from [[inhalation|breathing]] in [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) at excessive levels.&lt;ref name=Sc2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schottke|first1=David|title=Emergency Medical Responder: Your First Response in Emergency Care|date=2016|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1284107272|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=2 July 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910171934/https://books.google.com/books?id=gGCHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are often described as "[[flu]]-like" and commonly include [[headache]], [[dizziness]], weakness, vomiting, [[chest pain]], and [[confusion]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; Large exposures can result in [[loss of consciousness]], [[arrhythmias]], [[seizures]], or death.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; The classically described "cherry red skin" rarely occurs.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Long term complications may include feeling tired, trouble with memory, and movement problems.&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; In those [[smoke inhalation|exposed to smoke]], [[cyanide toxicity]] should also be considered.&lt;ref name=Gu2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guzman|first1=JA|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning.|journal=Critical care clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=537–48|pmid=22998990|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur accidentally or as an [[suicide|attempt to end one's life]].&lt;ref name=Buck2011/&gt; CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating.&lt;ref name=Bl2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleecker|first1=ML|title=Carbon monoxide intoxication|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|date=2015|volume=131|pages=191–203|pmid=26563790|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-62627-1.00024-X|series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|isbn=978-0444626271}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced during [[incomplete combustion|incomplete burning]] of [[organic matter]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; This can occur from [[motor vehicles]], heaters, or cooking equipment that run on [[carbon-based fuel]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2015FAQ/&gt; It can also occur from exposure to [[methylene chloride]].&lt;ref name=Fer2017/&gt; Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with [[hemoglobin]] to form [[carboxyhemoglobin]] (HbCO) preventing the [[blood]] from carrying [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=Bl2015/&gt; Additionally, [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondria]]l [[cytochrome oxidase]] are affected.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt; Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.&lt;ref name=Gu2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;

One of the major concerns following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur.

One classic sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is more often seen in the dead rather than the living – people have been described as looking red-cheeked and healthy (see below). However, since this "cherry-red" appearance is common only in the deceased, and is unusual in living people, it is not considered a useful diagnostic sign in clinical medicine. In pathological (autopsy) examination the ruddy appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning is notable because unembalmed dead persons are normally bluish and pale, whereas dead carbon-monoxide poisoned persons may simply appear unusually lifelike in coloration.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simini B|title=Cherry-red discolouration in carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Lancet| volume=352|issue=9134| page=1154|date=October 1998|pmid=9798630|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79807-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JEmergMed2002-brooks"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brooks DE, Lin E, Ahktar J |title=What is cherry red, and who cares?|journal= [[The Journal of Emergency Medicine]] |date=February 2002|pages=213–14|volume=22|issue=2|pmid=11858933|doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colorant effect of carbon monoxide in such postmortem circumstances is thus analogous to its use as a red colorant in the commercial meat-packing industry.

Carbon monoxide is a product of combustion of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete [[oxidation]] to [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Sources of carbon monoxide include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty [[furnace]]s, heaters, [[wood-burning stove]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-died-from-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-after-using-heat-beads-in-greystanes-home-20150718-gif8d8.html|title=Man died from carbon monoxide poisoning after using 'heat beads' in Greystanes home|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150719131747/http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-died-from-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-after-using-heat-beads-in-greystanes-home-20150718-gif8d8.html|archivedate=2015-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[internal combustion]] [[vehicle exhaust]], [[electrical generator]]s, [[propane]]-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as [[leaf blower]]s, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Occup Med1999-fawcett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Marc B, Bouchez-Buvry A, Wepierre JL, Boniol L, Vaquero P, Garnier M |title=Carbon-monoxide poisoning in young drug addicts due to indoor use of a gasoline-powered generator|journal=Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine|volume=8|issue=2|pages=54–56|date=June 2001|pmid=16083675|doi=10.1054/jcfm.2001.0474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson C, Moran J, Paine S, Anderson H, Breysse P |title=Abatement of toxic levels of carbon monoxide in Seattle ice-skating rinks|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=65|issue=10|pages=1087–90|date=October 1975|pmid=1163706|doi=10.2105/AJPH.65.10.1087|pmc=1776025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/co/|title=NIOSH Carbon Monoxide Hazards from Small Gasoline Powered Engines|accessdate=2007-10-15|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029032750/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/co/|archivedate=2007-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fife CE, Smith LA, Maus EA, McCarthy JJ, Koehler MZ, Hawkins T, Hampson NB |title=Dying to play video games: carbon monoxide poisoning from electrical generators used after hurricane Ike |journal=Pediatrics |volume=123 |issue=6 |pages=e1035–38 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19482736 |doi=10.1542/peds.2008-3273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=Emmerich, SJ|date=July 2011|title=Measured CO Concentrations at NIST IAQ Test House from Operation of Portable Electric Generators in Attached Garage – Interim Report|url=https://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=907771|publisher=United States National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=2012-04-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224044200/http://nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=907771|archivedate=2013-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

Another source of poisoning is exposure to the organic solvent [[dichloromethane]], found in some [[paint stripper]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Veen|first=MP|author2=Fortezza F |author3=Spaans E |author4=Mensinga TT |title=Non-professional paint stripping, model prediction and experimental validation of indoor dichloromethane levels|journal=Indoor Air|year=2002|volume=12|issue=2|pages=92–97|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0668.2002.01109.x|pmid=12216472}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the metabolism of dichloromethane produces carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="DrugMetabDispos1975-kubic"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kubic VL, Anders MW |title=Metabolism of dihalomethanes to carbon monoxide.

== Pathophysiology ==

The precise mechanisms by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to [[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]] and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing [[brain]] [[lipid peroxidation]].&lt;ref name="Weaver-NEJM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bateman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bateman DN|title=Carbon Monoxide|journal=Medicine|volume=31|issue=10|page=233|date=October 2003|doi=10.1383/medc.31.10.41.27810}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt;

=== Hemoglobin ===
[[File:Hemoglobin saturation curve.svg|thumb|Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left.]]
Carbon monoxide has a higher diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen, and the only enzyme in the human body that produces carbon monoxide is [[heme oxygenase]], which is located in all cells and breaks down [[heme]]. Under normal conditions, carbon monoxide levels in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]] are approximately 0 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] because it has a higher diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made.&lt;ref name="Kaplan.Physio"&gt;{{cite book|title=USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes: Physiology|year=2011|author=Dunn, Robert B.|author2=Kudrath, W. |author3=Passo, SS |author4=Wilson, LB|pages=167–68|chapter=7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Townsend CL, Maynard RL |title=Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=59|issue=10|pages=708–11|date=October 2002|pmid=12356933|pmc=1740215|doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPhysiol1895-Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haldane J|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1895|pages=430–62|volume=18|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|pmid=16992272|issue=5–6|pmc=1514663|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1895.sp000578|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708152937/http://jp.physoc.org/content/18/5-6/430.full.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemoglobin is a [[Tetrameric protein|tetramer]] with four oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon monoxide at one of these sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gorman D, Drewry A, Huang YL, Sames C |title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|date=May 2003|pages=25–38|volume=187|issue=1|pmid=12679050|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the [[oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve|oxygen dissociation curve]] to the left.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.

=== Myoglobin ===

Carbon monoxide also binds to the [[hemeprotein]] [[myoglobin]]. It has a high affinity for myoglobin, about 60 times greater than that of oxygen.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen.&lt;ref name="Bateman"/&gt; This causes reduced [[cardiac output]] and [[hypotension]], which may result in [[brain ischemia]].&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt; A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt;

=== Cytochrome oxidase ===

Another mechanism involves effects on the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible for effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to [[cytochrome oxidase]] with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gorman DF, Runciman WB |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=506–11 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1750629 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient [[adenosine triphosphate]] synthesis. Cells respond by switching to [[anaerobic metabolism]], causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], [[lactic acidosis]], and eventual cell death.&lt;ref name="PharmacolToxicol2003-alonso"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso JR, Cardellach F, Lopez S, Casademont J, Miro O |title=Carbon monoxide specifically inhibits cytochrome c oxidase of human mitochondrial respiratory chain|journal=Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology|date=September 2003|pages=142–46|volume=93|issue=3|pmid=12969439|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0773.2003.930306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of [[oxidative metabolism]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt;

=== Central nervous system effects ===

The mechanism that is thought to have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain [[lipid peroxidation]] (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes [[endothelial]] cell and platelet release of [[nitric oxide]], and the formation of [[oxygen free radicals]] including [[peroxynitrite]].&lt;ref name="JToxClinTox1994-hardy"/&gt; In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, [[capillary]] leakage, [[leukocyte]] sequestration, and [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumenthal I|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=June 2001|pages=270–72|volume=94|issue=6|pmid=11387414|url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11387414|format=Free full text|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these effects is [[lipid peroxidation]], which causes delayed reversible [[Demyelinating disease|demyelinization]] of [[white matter]] in the central nervous system known as [[Grinker myelinopathy]], which can lead to [[edema]] and [[necrosis]] within the brain.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2003-Gorman"/&gt; This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral [[white matter]] and [[basal ganglia]].&lt;ref name="JRSocMed2001-blumenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fan HC, Wang AC, Lo CP, Chang KP, Chen SJ |title=Damage of cerebellar white matter due to carbon monoxide poisoning: a case report|journal=[[The American Journal of Emergency Medicine]]|volume=27|issue=6|pages=757.e5–e7|date=July 2009|pmid=19751650|doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2008.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, [[globus pallidus]], [[cerebellum]], [[hippocampus]] and the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Prockop"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Prockop LD, Chichkova RI |title=Carbon monoxide intoxication: an updated review|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|date=Nov 2007|pages=122–30|volume=262|issue=1–2|pmid=17720201|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fukuhara M, Abe I, Matsumura K, Kaseda S, Yamashita Y, Shida K, Kawashima H, Fujishima M |title=Circadian variations of blood pressure in patients with sequelae of carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=American Journal of Hypertension |volume=9|issue=4 Part 1|pages=300–05|date=April 1996|pmid=8722431|doi=10.1016/0895-7061(95)00342-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===

Carbon monoxide poisoning in pregnant women may cause severe adverse [[fetus|fetal]] effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] by decreasing the release of maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the [[placenta]] and combines with [[fetal hemoglobin]], causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult.&lt;ref name=Toxicology2002/&gt; Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical.&lt;ref name="Greingor"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Greingor JL, Tosi JM, Ruhlmann S, Aussedat M |title=Acute carbon monoxide intoxication during pregnancy.

== Diagnosis ==

[[File:Breath CO Monitor.jpg|thumb|Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with its corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin.]]
As many symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult.&lt;ref name="Varon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bennetto L, Powter L, Scolding NJ |title=Accidental carbon monoxide poisoning presenting without a history of exposure: A case report|journal=Journal of Medical Case Reports|volume=2|issue=1|page=118|date=April 2008|pmid=18430228|doi=10.1186/1752-1947-2-118|pmc=2390579}}&lt;/ref&gt; A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] compared to the amount of [[hemoglobin]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

The ratio of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin molecules in an average person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%.&lt;ref name="Clinical Toxicology2001-ford"&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Ford MD, Delaney KA, Ling LJ, Erickson T |title=Clinical Toxicology|year=2001|page=1046|publisher=WB Saunders Company|isbn=0721654851}}&lt;/ref&gt; In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.&lt;ref&gt;Sato K, Tamaki K, Hattori H, et al.

Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 237–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

As people may continue to experience significant symptoms of CO poisoning long after their blood carboxyhemoglobin concentration has returned to normal, presenting to examination with a normal carboxyhemoglobin level (which may happen in late states of poisoning) does not rule out poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keleş A, Demircan A, Kurtoğlu G |title=Carbon monoxide poisoning: how many patients do we miss?|journal=European Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=15|issue=3|pages=154–57|date=June 2008|pmid=18460956|doi=10.1097/MEJ.0b013e3282efd519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] has stated, "carbon monoxide detectors are as important to home safety as smoke detectors are," and recommends each home have at least one carbon monoxide detector, and preferably one on each level of the building.&lt;ref name="cpsc.gov"/&gt; These devices, which are relatively inexpensive&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"/&gt; and widely available, are either battery- or AC-powered, with or without battery backup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Edward R|title=Keeping Watch on Carbon Monoxide|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 14, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|accessdate=2009-09-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100533/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/nyregion/home-clinic-keeping-watch-on-carbon-monoxide.html|archivedate=June 23, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment. If a relatively high level of carbon monoxide is detected, the device sounds an alarm, giving people the chance to evacuate and ventilate the building.&lt;ref name="Krenzelok EP"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krenzelok EP, Roth R, Full R |title=Carbon monoxide ... the silent killer with an audible solution |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |date=September 1996 |pages=484–86 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pmid=8765117 |doi=10.1016/S0735-6757(96)90159-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yoon SS, Macdonald SC, Parrish RG |title=Deaths from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning and potential for prevention with carbon monoxide detectors |journal=JAMA |date=March 1998 |pages=685–87 |volume=279 |issue=9 |pmid=9496987 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.9.685 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[smoke detector]]s, carbon monoxide detectors do not need to be placed near ceiling level.

The use of carbon monoxide detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the US, NFPA 720-2009,&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=NFPA 720: Standard for the Installation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detection and Warning Equipment|publisher=National Fire Protection Agency|location=Quincy, MA|year=2009|pages=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]], mandates the placement of carbon monoxide detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels.&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt; NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in non-residential buildings. These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes and other non-residential buildings, include three main points:&lt;ref name="NFPA720-2009"/&gt;
:1. A secondary power supply (battery backup) must operate all carbon monoxide notification appliances for at least 12 hours,
:2. Detectors must be on the ceiling in the same room as permanently installed fuel-burning appliances, and
:3. Detectors must be located on every habitable level and in every [[HVAC]] zone of the building.

Gas organizations will often recommend to get gas appliances serviced at least once a year.&lt;ref name="Gas Safe Register (UK Government Organization)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gas Safety in the Home |publisher=UK Gas Safe Register |accessdate=2013-05-27 |url=http://www.gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502012946/http://gassaferegister.co.uk/advice/being_gas_safe.aspx |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal requirements ===

The NFPA standard is not necessarily enforced by law. As of April 2006, the US state of Massachusetts requires detectors to be present in all residences with potential CO sources, regardless of building age and whether they are owner-occupied or rented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|title=MGL Ch. 148 §28F{{frac|1|2}} – Nicole's Law, effective March 31, 2006|work=malegislature.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230154311/http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXX/Chapter148/Section26F1~2|archivedate=December 30, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by municipal inspectors, and was inspired by the death of 7-year-old Nicole Garofalo in 2005 due to snow blocking a home heating vent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305145343/http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/subject/about/carbonmonoxide.html |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions may have no requirement or only mandate detectors for new construction or at time of sale.

Despite similar deaths in vehicles with clogged exhaust pipes (for example in the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] and [[February 2013 nor'easter]]) and the commercial availability of the equipment, there is no legal requirement for automotive CO detectors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===World Health Organization recommendations===
The following guideline values (ppm values rounded) and periods of time-weighted average exposures have been determined in such a way that the carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) level of 2.5% is not exceeded, even when a normal subject engages in light or moderate exercise:
* 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (87 ppm) for 15 min
* 60&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (52 ppm) for 30 min
* 30&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (26 ppm) for 1 h
* 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (9 ppm) for 8 h

For indoor air quality 7&amp;nbsp;mg/m3 (6 ppm) for 24 h (so as not to exceed 2% COHb for chronic exposure)

==History==
&lt;!-- Editors are strongly requested NOT to change the title of this paragraph until consensus has been achieved on the talk page. --&gt;

The earliest description of carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; Documented cases of carbon monoxide being used as a [[Suicide methods#Carbon monoxide|method of suicide]] date to at least 100 BC in [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name=Pen2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penney|first1=David G.|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|date=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0849384189|page=754|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910172025/https://books.google.com/books?id=793KBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA754|archivedate=2017-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work ''Misopogon'': "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside."&lt;ref&gt;Julian, ''Misopogon'' 341C-D&lt;/ref&gt; This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]].

[[John Scott Haldane]] identified carbon monoxide as the lethal constituent of [[afterdamp]], the gas created by [[combustion]], after examining many bodies of miners killed in pit explosions. Their skin was coloured cherry-pink from [[carboxyhaemoglobin]], the stable compound formed in the blood by reaction with the gas. As a result of his research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either white mice or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem. The [[canary in a coal mine|canary]] in British pits was replaced in 1986 by the electronic gas detector.

As part of the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], German [[Nazi]]s used [[gas van]]s at [[Chelmno extermination camp]] and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several [[extermination camp|death camps]] such as [[Treblinka]], [[Sobibor]] and [[Belzec]]. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in [[action T4]], the programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and [[disabled people]] before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by [[IG Farben]] in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as [[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]]. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers of people in the gas vans and the special [[gas chamber]]s used in the [[death camp]]s such as [[Treblinka]]. [[Exhaust fumes]] from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Genocide|vauthors=Totten S, Bartrop P, Markusen E|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|pages=129, 156|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526000146/http://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;ots=S8jhBY6NxB&amp;dq=nazi%20carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning&amp;f=false|archivedate=2013-05-26|df=|isbn=978-0313346422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of oxygen as treatment began in 1868.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt; The use of hyperbaric oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by Haldane in 1895 while its use in humans began in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Pen2007/&gt;

==Research==
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the body as a byproduct of converting [[protoporphyrin]] into [[bilirubin]]. This carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.&lt;ref name="goldfranks"/&gt;

Small amounts of CO are beneficial and enzymes exist that produce it at times of oxidative stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foresti|first1=R|last2=Bani-Hani|first2=MG|last3=Motterlini|first3=R|title=Use of carbon monoxide as a therapeutic agent: promises and challenges.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=April 2008|volume=34|issue=4|pages=649–58|pmid=18286265|doi=10.1007/s00134-008-1011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently under development and it is scheduled for a launch in December 2019, after being postponed due to the failure of the [[Long March 5]] [[launch vehicle]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="foust"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jeff Foust|title=Long March 5 failure to postpone China's lunar exploration program|url=http://spacenews.com/long-march-5-failure-to-postpone-chinas-lunar-exploration-program/|publisher=SpaceNews|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang'e 5 will be China's first [[sample return mission]], aiming to return at least 2 kilograms of lunar soil and rock samples back to the Earth.&lt;ref name='Ch 5'/&gt; Like its predecessors, the spacecraft is named after the Chinese moon goddess, [[Chang'e]]. This will be the first lunar sample-return mission since [[Luna 24]] in 1976. 

== Overview ==

The [[Chinese Lunar Exploration Program]] is designed to be conducted in three phases of incremental technological advancement: The first is simply reaching lunar orbit, a task completed by [[Chang'e 1]] in 2007 and [[Chang'e 2]] in 2010. The second is landing and roving on the Moon, as [[Chang'e 3]] did in 2013 and [[Chang'e 4]] is now expected to achieve in 2019. The third phase is collecting lunar samples from the near-side and sending them to Earth, a task for the future Chang'e 5 and [[Chang'e 6]] missions. The program aims to facilitate a crewed lunar landing in the 2030s and possibly build an outpost near the south pole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://qz.com/1262581/china-lays-out-its-ambitions-to-colonize-the-moon-and-build-a-lunar-palace/ China lays out its ambitions to colonize the moon and build a "lunar palace"]. Echo Huang, ''Quartz''. 26 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission profile==
The probe was planned for launch by the [[Long March 5]] rocket at the [[Wenchang Satellite Launch Center]] on [[Hainan Island]], but the failure of this vehicle in 2017 created uncertainty about its ability to carry Chang'e 5.&lt;ref name=foust/&gt; Targeted to the northwest region of the Moon, the specific region intended for sampling is [[Mons Rümker]] in [[Oceanus Procellarum]].&lt;ref name='Ch 5'/&gt;&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Andrew Jones|title=China confirms landing site for Chang'e-5 Moon sample return|url=https://gbtimes.com/china-confirms-landing-site-change-5-moon-sample-return|publisher=GB Times|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making a soft landing, the lander will dig {{convert|2|m|ft}} below the surface for a 2 kg lunar sample from [[basalt]] estimated to be 1.3 billion years old, younger than the 3&amp;ndash;4 billion year old samples obtained by the American [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]].&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

Unlike earlier Soviet missions, the mission will make [[Lunar orbit rendezvous|an automatic rendezvous]] and docking with the return module in lunar orbit before flying back to the Earth.&lt;ref name='Ch 5'/&gt;&lt;ref name=sf101/&gt;

===Chang'e 5-T1===
[[Chang'e 5-T1]] is an experimental robotic lunar mission that was launched on 23 October 2014 to conduct [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric re-entry]] tests on the capsule design planned to be used in the Chang'e 5 mission.&lt;ref name=Launched&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight101.com/change-5-test-mission-updates.html|title=Chinese Long March Rocket successfully launches Lunar Return Demonstrator|publisher=Spaceflight101|date=Oct 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-10/24/c_127134592.htm| title=China launches test return orbiter for lunar mission| publisher=Xinhuanet| date=Oct 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lander payload==
The lander will carry landing cameras, optical cameras, a mineral spectrometer, a soil gas analytical instrument, a soil composition analytical instrument, a sampling sectional thermo-detector, and a [[ground-penetrating radar]].&lt;ref name='Ch 5'/&gt;&lt;ref name="sf101"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chang'e 5 test mission|url=http://spaceflight101.com/change/change-5-test-mission/|publisher=Spaceflight101.com|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For acquiring samples, it will be equipped with a robotic arm, rotary-percussive drill, a scoop for sampling, and separation tubes to isolate individual samples.&lt;ref name="sf101"/&gt;

The company's technologies included [[Schema for Object-Oriented XML]] (SOX), an [[XML schema]] technology that influenced the development of the [[W3C]]'s [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema]] language and the [[Java Architecture for XML Binding]] (JAXB).

==History==
The company was founded in 1994 as DistriVision by Tom Gonzales and his son, Tom Gonzales Jr.&lt;ref name=charity&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/07/13/charity-sues-over-legacy-of-dot-com/ | title=Charity sues over legacy of dot-com | first=JOHN | last=SIMERMAN | work=[[East Bay Times]] | date=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed Commerce One in 1997 after Mark Hoffman became CEO.&lt;ref name=onlineextra/&gt;&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

In January 1999, the company acquired Veo Systems from Asim Abdullah for $300 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/33571/Commerce+One+Buys+Veo+Systems.htm | title=Commerce One Buys Veo Systems | work=[[QuinStreet]] | date=January 19, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 1999, the company acquired CommerceBid from [[Ramesh Balwani]] for $4.5 million in cash and 785,000 shares and the company partnered with [[General Motors]] to create an [[online marketplace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/06/business/company-news-commerce-one-buys-commercebid-for-stock-and-cash.html | title=COMMERCE ONE BUYS COMMERCEBID FOR STOCK AND CASH | agency=[[Bloomberg News]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 6, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In July 1999, on its first trading day after its [[initial public offering]], the company's stock price rose 190%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/07/01/technology/askjeeves/ | title=IPO a smash? Ask Jeeves | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=July 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, the company formed [[Covisint]] with [[Ford Motor Company]], [[General Motors]], [[Daimler AG]], [[Renault]], and [[Nissan]]. Ford and General Motors each received 14.4 million shares of Commerce One and Commerce One owned 2% of Covisint.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

In 2001, co-founder Tom Gonzales Jr. died of a rare cancer at age 35 and left his stake in the company in a trust to help the needy. His father was later accused of mismanaging trust funds.&lt;ref name=charity/&gt;

In October 2002, the company announced that it planned to lay off 400 employees, 36% of its staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/commerce-one-cuts-deep/ | title=Commerce One cuts deep | first=Alorie | last=Gilbert | work=[[CNET]] | date=October 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The company filed [[bankruptcy]] on October 6, 2004 and emerged from bankruptcy 2 months later.&lt;ref name=rises&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/eastbay/stories/2005/03/07/story1.html | title=Commerce One rises from dot-ashes | work=[[American City Business Journals]] | date=March 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mystery&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.law360.com/articles/3393/mystery-solved-novell-behind-acquisition-of-commerce-one-patents | title=Mystery Solved: Novell Behind Acquisition Of Commerce One Patents | first=Marius | last=Meland | work=[[Law360]] | date=May 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Don't Come Around Here No More'''" is a song written by [[Tom Petty]] of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] and [[David A. Stewart]] of [[Eurythmics]]. It was released in February 1985 as the [[lead single]] from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' ''[[Southern Accents]]'' album.

==Background and writing==
The original inspiration was a romantic encounter that producer [[David A. Stewart]] of [[Eurythmics]] had with [[Stevie Nicks]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=693 |title=Don't Come Around Here No More |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Stewart explained that the title's phrase was actually uttered by Nicks. She had broken up with [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] guitarist [[Joe Walsh]] the night before,&lt;ref&gt;''Conversations With Tom Petty'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and invited Stewart to her place for a party after an early Eurythmics show in [[Los Angeles]]. Stewart did not know who she was at the time, but went anyway. When the partygoers all disappeared to a bathroom for a couple of hours to snort cocaine, he decided to go upstairs to bed. He woke up at 5 a.m. to find Nicks in his room trying on Victorian clothing and described the entire scenario as very much reminiscent of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. Later that morning, she told Walsh, "Don't come around here no more."

== Music video ==
The music video is themed around ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' and was directed by Jeff Stein.  Dave Stewart appears as [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the caterpillar]] at the beginning, sitting on a mushroom with a hookah water pipe while playing a sitar. Petty appears in the video dressed as [[Mad Hatter|The Mad Hatter]], and actress Louise “Wish” Foley played [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hanh Nguyen |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/tom-pettys-dont-come-around-here-no-more-video-alice-in-wonderland-photos-explained-1201883496/ |title=Tom Petty’s Don’t Come Around Here No More: Alice in Wonderland Guide |publisher=IndieWire |date=October 3, 2017 |accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the climax of the video, Alice is turned into a cake and is eaten by Petty and even friends of her own. The video ends with her being swallowed whole by Petty, after which he gives a small [[burp]] and pats his mouth dry.

The '''Eisenhower Tree''' was a [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pine]] located on the [[Augusta National Golf Club]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt; In the 1950s it was named after then-[[U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] who unsuccessfully lobbied to have it taken down after it interfered with his golf game. Due to its size, history, and location on a prominent golf course, it is considered iconic of the Augusta golf course&lt;ref name="espn" /&gt; and is one of the most famous trees in American golf.&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/augusta-ice-storm-puts-end-eisenhower-tree |title=Augusta Ice Storm Puts an End to Eisenhower Tree |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 13, 2015 |last=Ferguson |first=Doug |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114102721/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/augusta-ice-storm-puts-end-eisenhower-tree |archivedate=January 14, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called "among the most famous landmarks in golf" by Cindy Boren in the ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/02/17/augusta-nationals-eisenhower-tree-is-storm-casualty/ |title=Augusta National’s Eisenhower Tree is storm casualty |work=[[Washington Post]] |first=Cindy |last=Boren |date=February 17, 2014 |accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "arguably the most famous tree in golf" by Martin Dempster of ''[[The Scotsman]]''.&lt;ref name="scotsman"/&gt; In February 2014, the tree was removed after suffering extensive damage from a major ice storm.

==Description and origins==
The tree species was a native loblolly pine. It stood about {{convert|65|ft|m}} tall and was wider than is typical. It was located on the 17th hole at the Augusta National Golf Club, approximately {{convert|210|yds|m}} from the Masters tee on the left side of the [[Fairway (golf)|fairway]]. It was estimated to be 100 to 125 years old at the time it died.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/08/sports/sports-of-the-times-ike-s-tree-re-enlists-as-augusta-hazard.html |title= Sports of The Times; Ike's Tree Re-enlists as Augusta Hazard |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Dave |last=Anderson |date=April 8, 1999 |accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters14/story/_/id/10467524/augusta-national-removes-eisenhower-tree-due-storm-damage | title=Augusta removes Eisenhower Tree |work=[[ESPN]] |first=Bob |last=Harig | date=February 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree was named after President Eisenhower, an Augusta National member, hit the tree while playing golf so many times that, at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/eisenhower-tree.htm |title=Eisenhower Tree: Where is it, and how did it get its name? |work=Golf.About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | last=Owen |first=David | year=1999 | isbn=978-0684867519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://onpar.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/the-day-augusta-said-ike-was-out-of-order/ | title=The Day Augusta Said Ike Was Out of Order | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 20, 2012 | accessdate=February 17, 2014 |last=Pennington |first=Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not wanting to offend the president, the club's chairman, [[Clifford Roberts]], immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request.&lt;ref name="owen" /&gt; Bumper stickers made during Eisenhower's second presidential campaign reading "[[Ben Hogan]] For President.

==Golfing history==

The Eisenhower Tree has played a prominent role in the annual [[Masters Tournament]].&lt;ref name="espn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="augusta"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/sports/golf/2014-02-16/masters-landmark-ikes-tree-suffers-major-damage-removed?v=1392572685 | title=Masters landmark Ike's Tree suffers major damage, removed | work=The Augusta Chronicle | date=February 16, 2014 | accessdate=February 17, 2014 | last=Boyette |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year, the Tree came into play as [[Tommy Aaron]] hit a shot off the 17th tee which became known as the "Lost Ball Incident". The ball could not be located and a drop was given. The next day according to Aaron, while playing on the 17th again, the ball apparently fell from its perch within the tree. [[Jack Nicklaus]] stated "I'm not sure I believe it."&lt;ref name="augusta"/&gt;

When the course was redesigned in 1999 to be more challenging, there were concerns about the tree blocking players but it proved not to be a hindrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eisenhower Tree no problem |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Ron |last=Kaspriske |date=April 8, 1999}} (Database: [[NewsBank]], Retrieved February 18, 2014 )&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Tiger Woods]] was playing a shot from underneath the Eisenhower and damaged his left knee and [[Achilles tendon]] when he slipped on some pine straw.  The injuries sidelined him until August 2011 and his world ranking dropped to 58th.&lt;ref name="augusta"/&gt;

==Damage and replacement==

In February 2014, the Eisenhower Tree was removed after suffering extensive damage during [[February 11–17, 2014 North American winter storm|a major ice storm]].&lt;ref name="augusta" /&gt; "The loss of the Eisenhower Tree is difficult news to accept", Augusta National chairman [[Billy Payne]] said. "We obtained opinions from the best [[arborist]]s available and … were advised that no recovery was possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2014/02/16/golf-ice-storm-destroys-eisenhower-tree-at-augusta-national/5536517/ |title=Eisenhower Tree removed  |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Steve |last=DiMeglio |date=February 17, 2014  |accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/17/augusta-eisenhower-tree-golf-woods-nicklaus |title='Eisenhower's Tree' is a high-profile victim of severe Augusta weather |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK |first=Ewan |last=Murray |date=February 17, 2014 |accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm occurred two months before the Masters Tournament.  A remnant of the tree was donated to the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, KS and is on display.

The loss of the tree brought tributes. Jack Nicklaus said, "The Eisenhower Tree is such an iconic fixture and symbol of tradition at Augusta National. It was such an integral part of the game and one that will be sorely missed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/sports-rec/augusta-national-eisenhower-tree-ice-storm-20140217 |title=Famed 'Eisenhower Tree' at Augusta National Golf Course Felled By Ice From Winter Storm Pax  |work=[[The Weather Channel]] |date=February 17, 2014 |accessdate=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another tree named after Eisenhower, located at [[Dalmeny Golf Club]] in [[Scotland]], planted by the President during a visit to [[Edinburgh]] to receive the freedom of the city in 1946. On hearing of the death in Augusta, the club offered to provide an acorn to plant a new oak tree.&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/golf/dalmeny-s-acorns-can-grow-a-new-eisenhower-s-tree-1-3309988 |title=Dalmeny’s acorns can grow a new Eisenhower’s Tree |work=[[The Scotsman]] |first=Martin |last=Dempster |date=February 18, 2014 |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few yards beyond the Eisenhower Tree, another tree was planted a number of years ago.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt; This tree was also removed due to the ice storm.&lt;ref name="espn"/&gt;

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1962''' was the seventh edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]], held on Sunday 18 March 1962 at the [[Villa Louvigny]] in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]. The contest was won for a third time by [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]] with the song "''[[Un premier amour]]''", performed by [[Isabelle Aubret]]. This marked the first time a country had won three contests. [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austria]], [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belgium]], [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Netherlands]], and [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] all scored "nul points" for the first time.&lt;ref name=ESC1962&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1962|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=279|publisher=[[EBU]]|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
{{details|topic=the host city|Luxembourg (city)}}
[[File:Luxembourg, villa Louvigny.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Villa Louvigny, Luxembourg – host venue of the 1962 contest.]]
The 1962 Eurovision Song Contest was hosted in [[Luxembourg City]]. The venue chosen to host the 1962 contest was the Villa Louvigny.  The building served as the headquarters of [[Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion]], the forerunner of [[RTL Group]].  It is located in [[Municipal Park (Luxembourg City)|Municipal Park]], in the [[Ville Haute]] [[Quarters of Luxembourg City|quarter]] of the centre of the city.&lt;ref name=ESC1962/&gt;

== Format ==
After France's entry had been performed, there was a short power failure rendering the screens dark. There also seemed to be an even shorter power failure during the Netherlands entry, when viewers around Europe only saw darkness on their television screens when the Netherlands performed. The power failure seemed to affect the Netherlands score during the voting. Nevertheless, the song turned out to be popular in Europe after the contest.&lt;ref name=ESC1962/&gt;

== Participating countries ==
{{Further information|List of countries in the Eurovision Song Contest}}
All countries who participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961]] returned for a second consecutive year, with no new countries making a début, nor any nations returning or withdrawing.&lt;ref name=ESC1962/&gt;

=== Conductors ===

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1997''', was the 42nd edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It took place in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], following [[Eimear Quinn]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 contest]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] with the song "[[The Voice (Eimear Quinn song)|The Voice]]". This was a record seventh hosting of the event for Ireland, and the fourth in five years.

The contest was held at the [[Point Theatre]] on 3 May 1997. [[Carrie Crowley]] and [[Boyzone]] member [[Ronan Keating]] were the presenters of the show.&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1997|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=312|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=3 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five countries took part in the 1997 Contest, which saw {{Esccnty|Italy}} return after a three-year absence - the last participation being in {{Escyr|1993|three-year absence}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy 1993|url=http://www.esc-history.com/details.asp?key=698|website=esc-history.com|publisher=ESC History|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with {{Esccnty|Denmark}}, {{Esccnty|Germany}}, {{Esccnty|Hungary}}, and {{Esccnty|Russia}}, who last took part in {{Escyr|1995|1995 Contest}}, despite having taken part in the non-televised [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996#Pre-qualifying round|1996 pre-qualifying round]] in which they failed to qualify and therefore were absent.&lt;ref name=Eurovision1996&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision Song Contest 1996|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=311|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=18 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Esccnty|Belgium}}, {{Esccnty|Finland}}, and {{Esccnty|Slovakia}} had to withdraw from the contest due to the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|relegation rule]].&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997/&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]] won the competition, thanks to [[Katrina and the Waves]], led by American-born [[Katrina Leskanich]], making it the second time that the British won the Eurovision on Irish soil (after [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]]).&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997/&gt; It also remains the last time the United Kingdom won the contest (as of 2018).

== Location ==
{{details|topic=the host city|Dublin}}
[[File:3_Arena_Front.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The Point Theatre, Dublin – host venue of the 1997 contest.]]
[[Ireland]] hosted the contest for the fourth time in five years after winning the {{Escyr|1996|1996 contest}} in Oslo. Dublin was chosen to be the host city, making it the sixth time that the Eurovision Song Contest was staged in the Irish capital. The venue for the contest was the [[Point Theatre]] located on the North Wall Quay of the [[River Liffey]], amongst the [[Dublin Docklands]]. The theatre previously hosted the {{Escyr|1994}} and {{Escyr|1995}} contests. The Point Theatre is the only venue to have hosted the final three times.&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997/&gt;

==Format==
After the controversy over the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996#Pre-qualifying round|1996 pre-qualifying round]], the [[European Broadcasting Union]] introduced a new system for 1997: countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four years would be excluded from the 1997 contest, and those with the lowest averages over the previous five years would be excluded from future contests (save that every country so excluded for one year would automatically be allowed to participate the following year), with so many countries being omitted as would reduce the number of participants each year to 25.&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997/&gt;

Israel declined to participate, as the Contest was held on its [[Yom HaShoah|Holocaust Remembrance Day]], granting a reprieve to Bosnia and Herzegovina, which would otherwise have been excluded owing to its low point average over the previous four years.&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997/&gt; RTÉ once again produced a highly spectacular show, with a stage that had a smaller performance space for the artists than in previous years. This was the third Eurovision set to be designed by Paula Farrell, who had previously been involved with the 1988 and 1994 contests.&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997/&gt;

There was a wide array of different styles this year. Denmark brought a [[hip hop music|rap]] song, Croatia came with their version of the [[Spice Girls]] and Sweden brought a mid-1980s style [[boy band]]. The music was in general more modern than before, and for the first time since {{Escyr|1991|six years}}, an [[up-tempo]] song won.&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997/&gt; This year, [[Televoting#Televoting in the Eurovision Song Contest|televoting]] was tested in five countries: Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The results of the televoting countries were, in some cases, different from those that used a jury. Iceland received 16 of its 18 points from these five countries.&lt;ref name=Eurovision1997/&gt;

Also, for the first time in Eurovision history, there was a country where not one, but two spokespeople gave votes - France. Television reporter [[Frédéric Ferrer]] and {{Escyr|1977}} Eurovision winner [[Marie Myriam]] each took turns at giving results from that country. Long-time Irish conductor [[Noel Kelehan]] was not the host conductor this year, the duty being fulfilled by [[Frank McNamara (musician)|Frank McNamara]].

==Scoreboard==
Each country had a jury that awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points for their top ten songs, or a televote, where the top ten most voted for songs were awarded the 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points.  Iceland got most of its 18 points from the 5 countries that used televoting. Ireland was ostensibly the best scoring country across the televoting countries, except they were able to score points from all 5 televoting countries. The United Kingdom was only eligible to receive points from 4 of them, since they couldn't vote for themselves. In fact, the UK received 12 points from all the other televoting countries except Germany, from whom they received 10 points: in other words, the UK earned 46 of 48 possible televote points that year; Ireland earned 47 of 60 possible televote points—including their only 12 from the UK.&lt;ref name="1997 Results"/&gt;

==Winners==
[[Katrina and the Waves]], (with lead vocalist [[Katrina Leskanich]]) representing the United Kingdom, were the winners of the contest with the song "[[Love Shine a Light]]", written by that band's lead guitarist [[Kimberley Rew]], and [[Marc Roberts (singer-songwriter)|Marc Roberts]] from Republic of Ireland came second with "[[Mysterious Woman]]". Despite being the runner-up, it remarkably received only one 12-point score, which came from the United Kingdom. The UK spokesman [[Colin Berry]] remarked: "You're going to like this one: Ireland, twelve points!" causing [[Terry Wogan]] to reply: "Well, tit for tat!" The winning song scored an unprecedented 227 points; it received points from all participating countries, including five sets of 10 points and a record-breaking ten sets of the maximum 12 points. "Love Shine a Light" is still regarded as one of the most successful Eurovision winners,&lt;ref group="N"&gt;As noted on a [[TOTP2]] Eurovision special, it ranks third in the rankings of points achieved as a percentage of maximum available with 227 out of 288 or 78.81%, behind [[Nicole (German singer)|Nicole]]'s "[[Ein bißchen Frieden]]" in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]] (161 out of 204 or 78.92%) and [[Brotherhood of Man]]'s "[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]" in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] (164 out of 204 or 80.39%). For comparison, Elena Paparizou's 2005 win took 230 points out of a possible 456, or only 50.04%.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the closing song in the medleys that opened the 50th anniversary show "[[Congratulations (Eurovision)|Congratulations]]" in [[Copenhagen]] in 2005, and the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|ESC 2006]] semi-final in [[Athens]]. With this victory, the United Kingdom has five Eurovision wins and it is to date the country's last win in the Contest.

==Barbara Dex Award==
For the first time, the fansite House of Eurovision presented the [[Barbara Dex Award]], a humorous award given to the worst dressed artist each year in the contest. It is named after the Belgian artist, [[Barbara Dex]], who came last in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993 contest]], in which she wore her own self designed dress. House of Eurovision would continue to provide the Barbara Dex Award until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], when another Eurovision fansite, songfestival.be, took the reins of the award and will present it every year starting with the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017|2017 Eurovision Song Contest]] in Ukraine.

[[Debbie Scerri]] of Malta was the 1997 Barbara Dex Award winner.

Such trailers are intended to provide intermediate term shelter, functioning longer than  [[tents]] which are often used for short-term shelter immediately following a disaster. FEMA trailers serve a similar function to the "earthquake shacks" erected to provide interim housing after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Joseph Darnell|title=A Minimalistic Approach to  Adaptive, Emergency Relief Structures  Embodied by  Promoting a Downsized Way of Life|date=August 3, 2013|publisher=Auburn University (Thesis)|location=Auburn, Alabama|url=https://etd.auburn.edu/bitstream/handle/10415/3705/Joseph%20D.%20Brown%20Final%20Thesis%20Document.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref name=Rafkin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rafkin|first1=Louise|title=Earthquake Refugee Cottages|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/us/cottages-from-1906-san-francisco-quake-are-preserved.html?_r=0|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=The Texas Tribune|date=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shacks&gt;{{cite web|title=1906 Earthquake Refugee Shacks|url=http://www.outsidelands.org/shacks.php|website=The Western Neighborhoods Project|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News reports of health issues relating to Katrina-issue FEMA trailers began to appear in July 2006.&lt;ref name=TinCan/&gt; A federal report in July 2008 identified toxic levels of [[formaldehyde]] in 42% of the trailers examined, attributing problems to poor construction and substandard building materials.&lt;ref name="Hsu2"/&gt; As of 2012, two class-action lawsuits were settled, between residents of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas, and (1) manufacturers who built mobile homes for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and (2) FEMA contractors who installed and maintained them.&lt;ref name=Brunker/&gt;

FEMA trailers are the property of the U.S. Government and are expected to be returned after use.  In 1995, some Florida residents who had difficulty finding accommodation in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Andrew]] "bought their FEMA trailers for an average of $1,100 each."&lt;ref name=FEMAandrew/&gt; Following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the U.S. Government was left with large numbers of FEMA trailers.  Surplus FEMA trailers were sold via online public auctions conducted by the [[General Services Administration]].  The distribution and resale of Katrina FEMA trailers has been heavily criticized given the possible health risks involved.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Ariella|title=Despite health fears, trailers are housing disaster victims|url=http://thelensnola.org/2011/05/19/fema-trailers-formaldehyde-katrina-rita-tuscaloosa-tornadoe/|accessdate=14 September 2015|work=The Lens|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, FEMA has modified its model for responding to storms. It provides money for temporary housing or repairs to get through the emergency, and treats FEMA trailers as a "last resort".&lt;ref name="Schmall"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schmall|first1=Emily|last2=Bajak|first2=Frank|title=FEMA sees trailers only as last resort after Harvey, Irma|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/fema-sees-trailers-resort-harvey-irma-49742355|accessdate=14 September 2017|work=ABC News|date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:UptownNapoleonFEMAtrailerFlag.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A '''FEMA trailer''' ([[travel trailer]]) in front of a formerly flooded house in New Orleans.]]

Although several types and sizes of manufactured structures have been installed throughout the Gulf Coast region, most are [[Mass production|mass-produced]], one-bedroom [[travel trailer]]s.  These typical FEMA trailers are designed to accommodate two adults and two children.  There are larger trailers and other manufactured structures that can accommodate larger families.

A typical FEMA trailer can measure 14' by 22' (308 sq. ft.)&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;{{rp|56}} or 8' by 32' (256 sq. ft.).&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt;{{rp|83}}  It consists of a master bedroom with a standard size bed, a living area with kitchen and stove, bunk beds, and a bathroom with shower.  Each trailer is equipped with electricity, air conditioning, indoor heating, running cold and hot water, a propane-operated stove and oven, a small microwave oven, a large refrigerator, and a few pieces of furniture attached to the floor; usually a sofabed, a small table, and two chairs.  There are only a handful of FEMA trailer designs, so nearly all trailers have the same general layout. Furniture is attached to the trailer; it is not possible to move it, and it would be illegal to do so. It is also illegal to paint the inside or outside of the trailer.&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=Katherine E.|title=Standing in the Need Culture, Comfort, and Coming Home after Katrina|date=2015|publisher=University of Texas Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18BjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82–86}} Trailers have little storage space, can be very cramped, and offer little or no privacy.&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kunzelman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kunzelman|first1=Michael|title=A new normal' life for family sharing FEMA trailers|url=http://djournal.com/news/a-new-normal-life-for-family-sharing-fema-trailers/|accessdate=17 September 2015|work=Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal|date=March 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peacock&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Peacock|editor-first1=Walter Gillis|title=Hurricane Andrew : ethnicity, gender and the sociology of disasters|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415168113|pages=129–131|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLw8XmpRnhoC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each trailer is elevated about two feet (0.6 m) above the ground, on concrete supports.  There is only one door on the side of each trailer, which is accessible through a wooden or aluminum stairwell.  There are also [[Inclined plane|long ramps]] for wheelchair-using occupants.  [[Electric power transmission|Electrical service]] to the FEMA trailers is installed by the local power company. (For example, in most of the Gulf Coast region power is provided by the [[Entergy|Entergy Corporation]].)  Each trailer has its own [[Electricity meter|power meter]].  Trailers have ports for telephone access, [[Cable television|cable]], and [[Internet access]].  However, these services are not handled by FEMA, and a trailer occupant must arrange to have these services installed by a local provider.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

The typical FEMA trailer has two [[Propane#Uses|propane tanks]] on the front of the trailer behind the master bedroom, which provide the hot water, indoor heating, and gas for the stove and oven.  Running water for the trailer is usually provided by some sort of [[Water supply network|water source on the property]], usually through a garden hose.  [[Sewage]] is piped directly to an [[Waste management|underground sewage main]] on the property.  Most trailers have several windows which can be opened, as well as small light fixtures in each room.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

FEMA trailers are manufactured from plastic, aluminum, and particle board, and are therefore somewhat flimsy and require more maintenance than a permanent structure.  They are also poorly insulated, offer little sound insulation, and are known to sway in high winds.&lt;ref name=Reeder&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reeder|first1=Linda|title=Enough Already: Katrina, FEMA Trailers, and the Road Forward|url=http://www.aia.org/akr/Resources/Documents/AIAP037883|website=The American Institute of Architects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While occupying FEMA travel trailers or [[mobile home]]s, residents are responsible for maintaining their trailers, such as keeping the trailers clean, changing lightbulbs and [[smoke detector|smoke-detector]] batteries, and making sure [[Propane#Uses|propane fuel tanks]] are refilled with fuel.&lt;ref name=FEMAPickup/&gt;

Travel trailers and mobile homes are to be inspected once a month for the occupant's safety and convenience: if a travel trailer or mobile home requires maintenance beyond basic upkeep, residents are told to call the appropriate travel trailer maintenance hotline for their [[civil parish|parish]] or county.&lt;ref name=FEMAPickup/&gt;  In Houston, 1200 of the 4600 trailers initially issued after Hurricane Rita required serious repairs by late 2006.&lt;ref name=Houstonian&gt;{{cite news|title=Users damaged 1,200 FEMA trailers since Rita, agency says|url=http://houstonianonline.com/2006/11/02/users-damaged-1200-fema-trailers-since-rita-agency-says/|work=The Houstonian|date=November 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

   that it felt like it would never end, saying winds were at
   least 100 miles per hour in Gulfport for seven hours, between
   about 7:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. For another five or six hours,
   on each side of that, they [Gulfport] had hurricane-force winds
   over 75 miles per hour; much of the city [Gulfport, Mississippi,
   in Harrison County] of 71,000 was then under water.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged areas may take substantial periods of time to repair. Residents may be unable to return home for long periods of time while local government officials attempt to restore basic infrastructure for water and electricity.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Christine|title=Disaster recovery: a local government responsibility|journal=PM Magazine|date=2009|volume=91|issue=2|url=http://webapps.icma.org/pm/9102/public/cover.cfm?author=christine%20becker&amp;title=disaster%20recovery%3A%20%20a%20local%20government%20responsibility|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flood damage to existing homes and apartments may require the complete removal and replacement of carpeting, [[Laminate flooring|flooring]], [[Building insulation|insulation]], and [[Drywall|sheetrock]].&lt;ref name=AmericanRedCross&gt;{{cite web|title=Repairing  Your  Flooded  Home|url=http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4540081_repairingFloodedHome.pdf|website=American Red Cross|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flood damage beyond a few inches may also destroy furniture, appliances, and other personal belongings.  Buildings that have sustained significant water damage, including apartment complexes, often require extensive rebuilding and a mold-removal process known as "[[mold remediation]]" before they can be rendered safe enough for habitation.&lt;ref name=MoldRemediation&gt;{{cite web|title=Mold Remediation |url=http://www.fema.gov/9500-series-policy-publications/mold-remediation |website=FEMA.gov |accessdate=17 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905174615/http://www.fema.gov/9500-series-policy-publications/mold-remediation |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roofs may also need to be replaced or repaired.

Widespread damage in an area may cause extreme housing shortages. The extent of the rebuilding effort in such an area may cause a shortage of [[General contractor|building contractors]] and materials throughout the region.  This further delays the construction of new housing, and increases a need for existing apartments or motels to house incoming construction and service workers.  Leasing rates for apartments may become prohibitively high for those who have lost their homes, particularly [[working class]] storm victims.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Yan|last2=[[Suzanne Jane Wilkinson|Wilkinson]]|first2=Suzanne|last3=Potangaroa|first3=Regan|last4=Seville|first4=Erica|title=Resourcing challenges for post-disaster housing reconstruction: a comparative analysis|journal=Building Research &amp; Information|date=June 2010|volume=38|issue=3|pages=247–264|doi=10.1080/09613211003693945|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.462.1617&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Esnard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esnard|first1=Ann-Margaret|last2=Sapat|first2=Alka|title=Displaced by disaster : recovery and resilience in a globalizing world|date=2014|isbn=978-0415856041|url=http://www.erica.demon.co.uk/EV/reviews/131_Esnard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA trailers, which are offered rent-free, may be the only form of [[List of house types|habitable dwellings]] available to those within a disaster area.

FEMA policy generally allows residents to live in a FEMA trailer for a period of 18 months, beginning at the time at which they receive access to the trailer. However, this period has sometimes been extended when availability of housing continued to be a serious problem for a longer time.&lt;ref name=FEMAwaveland/&gt;  In the case of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, deadlines were extended to allow people to live in trailers for up to 45 months.&lt;ref name=FiveDollars/&gt;

== Application process ==
People within a disaster area are eligible to apply for various forms of "Housing assistance" from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). These may include: (1) reimbursement for short term hotel expenses (2) money or vouchers towards rental of a place to live for up to 18 months while your home is being repaired (3) money to make repairs to your home (4) money to purchase a new home if your home cannot be repaired (5) a temporary "FEMA-owned manufactured housing unit" as a last resort if no other housing options are available.&lt;ref name=WhatIsAssistance&gt;{{cite web|title=What Specific Items are Covered by "Housing Assistance"? |url=http://www.fema.gov/apply-assistance/what-specific-items-are-covered-housing-assistance |website=FEMA.org |accessdate=17 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906021921/https://www.fema.gov/apply-assistance/what-specific-items-are-covered-housing-assistance |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain disaster manufactured housing, someone must complete a FEMA application, after which they will be interviewed by a FEMA adjuster, who is similar to an [[Claims adjuster|insurance claims adjuster]].  The adjuster will determine if the damage to the home warrants temporary housing until the home is repaired.&lt;ref name=Tulane&gt;{{cite web|title=FEMA Information |url=http://www.tulane.edu/info_fema.html |website=Tulane University |accessdate=17 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113301/http://www.tulane.edu/info_fema.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   After approval, the applicant is placed on a waiting list.

== Installation ==

[[File:Uptown25Jan06FEMAtrailerPark1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|FEMA trailer park, in what had been a neighborhood [[playground]].]]

FEMA requires that a property must have running water and power BEFORE a trailer can be installed. Utilities must be available at the site: FEMA will not install trailers in neighborhoods that have no access to running water or electricity.&lt;ref name=DailyComet&gt;{{cite news|title=How to get a FEMA trailer (be prepared to wait)|url=http://www.dailycomet.com/article/20051021/HURBLOG/51022002|accessdate=17 September 2015|work=Daily Comet|date=October 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FEMA subcontracts the installation of FEMA trailers to numerous private contractors.  First, a subcontractor installs the trailer itself.  After this, other contractors install the access stairs or ramps, furniture, home appliances, and water.  Next, the power company must be contacted to install a power line and power meter for the trailer.  Finally, a FEMA inspector will inspect the trailer for safety compliance.  Only after this lengthy process, will the occupant receive the keys for their trailer.&lt;ref name=Entergy&gt;{{cite web|title=FEMA Trailers|url=http://www.entergy-neworleans.com/your_home/storm_center/FEMA_trailers.aspx|website=Entergy News|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many FEMA trailers are installed on the private property of homeowners, usually on lawns and sometimes in driveways next to the house.  However, there are also numerous FEMA operated [[trailer park]]s where many storm victims have been living.&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarthy|first1=Francis X.|title=FEMA Disaster Housing: From Sheltering to  Permanent Housing|date=August 27, 2010|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40810.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NoWay&gt;{{cite book|last1=The Louisiana Justice Institute|title=NO WAY TO TREAT OUR PEOPLE:  FEMA Trailer Residents 30 Months after Katrina|date=2008|url=http://www.louisianajusticeinstitute.org/files/all/docs/LJI_FEMA_Trailer_Report_Publication.pdf|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer parks operated by FEMA range from small lots, consisting of a dozen trailers in the parking lots of office buildings and supermarkets, to several massive parks occupying large plots of land with hundreds of trailers.  In some cases larger parks are surrounded by a [[Chain link fencing|chain-link fence]] and [[Security lighting|brightly lit]]. FEMA has also provided police security and controlled access to the larger parks.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Vincanne|title=Markets of sorrow, labors of faith : New Orleans in the wake of Katrina|date=2013|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham and London|isbn=978-0822354499|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTvGAcSEn4gC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FEMA trailer parks have developed into small communities, with both the benefits and problems that are involved.&lt;ref name=Browne/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peacock/&gt;&lt;ref name=NoWay/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

Reports of health problems in the FEMA trailers deployed in 2005 had begun to appear by July 2006. Residents reported breathing difficulties, persistent flu-like symptoms, eye irritation, and nosebleeds. The cause was suspected to be high [[formaldehyde]] levels in the trailers.&lt;ref name=TinCan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brunker|first1=Mike|title=Are FEMA trailers 'toxic tin cans'?

Scientists suspected that the rush to produce large numbers of trailers might have caused manufacturers to cut corners—using low-cost or poorly prepared materials such as glues and pressed wood in construction of the trailers, and resulting in high levels of formaldehyde emissions.&lt;ref name=Dilanian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hsu&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Spencer S.|title=Safety Lapses Raised Risks In Trailers for Katrina Victims|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/24/AR2008052401973.html|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=Washington Post|date=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, tests on a number of FEMA trailers by the [[Sierra Club]] showed 83% had levels of formaldehyde in the indoor air at levels above the EPA recommended limit.&lt;ref name=Dilanian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dilanian|first1=Ken|title=FEMA blasted over trailer toxins|journal=USA Today|date=July 19, 2007|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-19-trailers_N.htm|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USGPO&gt;{{cite book|last1=United States|title=Federal housing response to Hurricane Katrina : hearing before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, One Hundred Tenth Congress, first session, February 06, 2007.|date=2007|publisher=U.S. G.P.O.|location=Washington|isbn=9780160786358|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005567067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressmen [[Henry Waxman]] and [[Charlie Melancon]] requested that FEMA test the trailers and address the issue.&lt;ref name=Dying&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spake|first1=Amanda|title=Dying for a Home: Toxic Trailers Are Making Katrina Refugees Ill|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/dying-home|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=The Nation|date=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers For Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) performed indoor air quality testing for formaldehyde in some of the units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC published a preliminary report confirming that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by FEMA.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080611220238/http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/trailerstudy/pdfs/SummaryofStudyFindings.pdf Formaldehyde Levels in FEMA-Supplied Trailers (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2008, researchers conducting a federally funded analysis reported that the toxic levels of formaldehyde were found in 42% of the trailers tested, and that they were attributable to faulty construction practices and the use of substandard building materials.&lt;ref name="Hsu2"&gt;{{cite news

As a result, FEMA modified its specifications for emergency housing, requiring that units be larger and better ventilated.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; Construction of "manufactured homes" provided in New Jersey in 2012 was regulated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;ref name=Vilensky&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vilensky|first1=Mike|last2=Maloney|first2=Jennifer|title=What's in a Name?

== Distribution and resale ==

On March 25, 2006, FEMA issued a news release requesting residents to call the FEMA Trailer Hotline to schedule removal of unneeded FEMA trailers after Katrina and Rita-related use.&lt;ref name=FEMApickup&gt;

In May 2009, FEMA sent eviction notices to residents in Mississippi who were living in FEMA trailers, sparking protests that the lack of available housing would result in them facing homelessness.&lt;ref name=Fausset&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fausset|first1=Richard|title=FEMA Calls Off Trailer Evictions|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/21/nation/na-trailer21|accessdate=17 September 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness of health concerns did not deter some residents, one of whom commented that "A dry roof over a toxic trailer beats no roof at all."&lt;ref name=UPI/&gt; On May 30, FEMA extended a deadline that would have evicted people from FEMA trailers. A FEMA spokesman said the organization was working with federal, state and local partners to help the residents get long-term housing.&lt;ref name=UPI&gt;{{cite news|title=Katrina protesters seek housing, changes|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/06/02/Katrina-protesters-seek-housing-changes/88681243961771/|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=UPI.com|date=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2009, FEMA announced plans to virtually give away roughly 1,800 mobile homes to 3,400 families displaced by Hurricane Katrina who were living in government-provided housing along the Gulf Coast.&lt;ref name=FiveDollars&gt;{{cite news|title=Katrina Trailers for Sale -- for $5 or Less: White House to sell homes to hurricane-displaced families for as little as $1|url=http://whatsnews.proboards.com/thread/1765|work=MSNBC.com|date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NickShapiro FEMA Trailer Sticker.jpg |right|thumb|200px| Sticker reads "NOT TO BE USED FOR HOUSING"]]

In 2010, the General Services Administration began holding mass public auctions of returned FEMA trailers. Units were marked with stickers that identified them as not suitable for housing, and buyers were required to sign a waiver agreeing that trailers would not be used as housing, and that new owners would be informed of the risks if the units were resold. The stickers are easy to remove, and Katrina FEMA trailers have been widely resold without any warning of possible health hazards. As many as 130,000 trailers are reported to have gone into the resale market, often in disaster zones and other places where there is strong demand for low-cost housing.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

In Alabama and other parts of the South, after tornadoes caused widespread destruction in 2011, post-Katrina trailers were being sold for between $2,000 and $4,000 each.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; FEMA trailers have been sold to oil-field workers in areas such as North Dakota, where housing is in short supply.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Heather|title=People are still living in FEMA’s toxic Katrina trailers — and they likely have no idea|url=http://grist.org/politics/people-are-still-living-in-femas-toxic-katrina-trailers-and-they-likely-have-no-idea/|accessdate=16 September 2015|work=Grist.com|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trailers were also distributed to Native American reservations,&lt;ref name=Tribes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Kenneth J.|title=As Housing Shortage Worsens, Tribes Forced to Use FEMA Trailers|url=http://newamericamedia.org/2011/05/as-housing-crisis-escalates-native-american-tribes-use-fema-mobile-homes.php|accessdate=17 September 2015|work=America's Wire, News Report|date=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress&gt;{{cite news|title=Vacant FEMA trailers from Katrina given to Indian tribes in need of housing|url=http://blog.al.com/wire/2011/07/vacant_fema_trailers_from_katr.html|work=Associated Press|date=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the Mescalero Apache in New Mexico, Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota and South Dakota, the Cherokee in Oklahoma and the Oglala Sioux in South Dakota.&lt;ref name=PoliticsReport&gt;{{cite news|title=FEMA ships Katrina trailers to Native American reservations|url=http://politicsreport.com/news/fema-ships-katrina-trailers-native-american-reservations|accessdate=14 September 2015|work=Politics Report|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to determine whether a trailer was originally one of the Hurricane Katrina trailers by checking the vehicle's VIN.&lt;ref name=VIN&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you own a post-Katrina FEMA trailer?|url=http://assets.grist.org/article/people-are-still-living-in-femas-toxic-katrina-trailers-and-they-likely-have-no-idea/index.html|website=Grist.com|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of resources have been suggested for those concerned about a FEMA trailer.&lt;ref name=So&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Heather|title=So you’re living in one of FEMA’s Katrina trailers|url=http://grist.org/article/what-do-i-do-if-i-am-living-in-a-fema-trailer/|website=Grist.com|date=August 27, 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Class-action settlements == 
As of 2012, U.S. District Judge [[Kurt D. Engelhardt]] of New Orleans approved a $42.6 million class-action lawsuit settlement. Plaintiffs, who included roughly 55,000 residents of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas, had  alleged that the FEMA trailers emitted hazardous levels of the toxic chemical formaldehyde. The defendants included two dozen manufacturers who built mobile homes for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including Gulf Stream Coach Inc., Forest River Inc., Vanguard LLC and Monaco Coach Corp. A separate $5.1 million settlement dealt with claims against FEMA contractors including Shaw Environmental Inc., Bechtel Corp., Fluor Enterprises Inc. and CH2M Hill Constructors Inc., who were responsible for installing and maintaining the units.&lt;ref name=Brunker&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brunker|first1=Mike|title=Class-action suit against FEMA trailer manufacturers settled for $42.6 million|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/28/14140222-class-action-suit-against-fema-trailer-manufacturers-settled-for-426-million|accessdate=11 September 2015|work=NBC News|date=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major '''Fred Hargesheimer''' (May 7, 1916&amp;nbsp;– December 23, 2010) was a former pilot of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] who was shot down during [[World War II]] over [[Papua New Guinea]] in June 1943. He later became a philanthropist who helped out the village that had hidden him from the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].

==Early life==
Hargesheimer was born and raised in [[Rochester, Minnesota]]. He earned a BS in Electrical Engineering from [[Iowa State College]] in 1940 before moving to [[Alpine, New Jersey]], to work for FM radio pioneer [[Edwin H. Armstrong]].&lt;ref name="vipclubmn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Ed|title=Fred Hargesheimer and ERA/Univac Story|url=http://vipclubmn.org/Documents/Fred_Hargesheimer.pdf|work=2007|publisher=Vipclubmn|accessdate=24 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129210833/http://vipclubmn.org/Documents/Fred_Hargesheimer.pdf|archivedate=29 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Hargesheimer served with the 8th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron of the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. He was flying a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|Lockheed P-38F-4]] on a photo reconnaissance mission on June 5, 1943, over the island of [[New Britain]], [[Papua New Guinea]], when his plane was attacked by a Japanese [[Kawasaki Ki-45|Ki-45 Nick]] fighter. Despite his injuries and jammed canopy, he was able to parachute to safety. For the next month he fought to survive in the jungle. He was found by members of the Nakanai tribe after 31 days. They sheltered him for five months in the village of Ea Ea, risking their lives to protect him from being found by Japanese soldiers. He met up with [[Coastwatchers|Australian Coastwatchers]] who moved him inland. On February 5, 1944, Fred, along with other downed airmen, was rescued by the submarine {{USS|Gato|SS-212|6}}. He was awarded the [[Purple Heart]], the [[Silver Star]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], the [[Air Medal]], and the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]]. After the war, he returned to his hometown of [[Rochester, Minnesota]], where he raised a family of his own.

As a World War II U.S. Army pilot, he was shot down over the Japanese-occupied island and was protected by villagers for months. In gratitude, he later built this and another school, libraries and a clinic, and he and his wife taught island children in the 1970s.

He came home and raised $15,000 over three years, "most of it $5 and $10 gifts," and then returned with son Richard in 1963 to contract for the construction of the school.&lt;ref name="ctpost.com"&gt;[http://www.ctpost.com/default/article/WWII-pilot-who-forever-repaid-rescuers-dies-at-94-917792.php/ WWII Pilot who Forever Repaid Rescuers Dies at 94, ''The Associated Press'', December 23, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226163440/http://www.ctpost.com/default/article/WWII-pilot-who-forever-repaid-rescuers-dies-at-94-917792.php |date=December 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple four-room schoolhouse became known as the Airmen's Memorial School * [http://airmensmemorialfoundation.org/Airmens_Memorial_Foundation_U.S./AMFUS_Welcome.html]. Hargesheimer returned many times for the next 40 years, building a library as well as infrastructure for the village of Ea Ea, now known as Nantabu. From 1970 to 1974 he and his wife, Dorothee, lived there.&lt;ref name="ctpost.com" /&gt; He was known by the locals as '''Mastah Preddi''', a corruption of '''Master Freddie'''. In 2000, he was proclaimed "Suara Auru," or "Chief Warrior" in the native language. Hargesheimer returned in 2006 for his last visit. During the trip, he visited the site where the wreckage of his old P-38 had been recently found. Hargesheimer also attended the opening of a new library at the Noau school.

==Contact with his attacker==
In 1999, aided by amateur Japanese historians of World War II, he contacted the wife of the man who had shot him down. He had always wondered why the pilot had never taken the time to finish him off when he was parachuting to the ground. By then the man, Mitsugu Hyakutomi of [[Yamaguchi, Japan]], was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. His wife said that her husband had always said that he could never shoot down such defenseless parachuting fliers.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanley|first=Charles J. |title=‘Mastah Preddi’ fell from the sky, into hearts Islanders heal, hail WW2 pilot; man changes lives, returns to build school|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23538741/|work=Mar 8 2008|publisher=MSNBC via AP|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gallo-Roman Museum''' ({{lang-nl|Gallo-Romeins Museum}}, {{lang-fr|Musée Gallo-romain}}, {{lang-de|Gallo-Römisches Museum}}) is an archeological museum in [[Tongeren]]. It is dedicated to the prehistorical times and Roman age of the region in South East [[Flanders]]. The museum was established in 1954 and received its modern building in 1994. In 2011, it was awarded as the European Museum of the Year.

==History==

In the 19th century the Royal History and Antiquarian Society of Tongeren had amassed a collection of archaeological discoveries from the area. Some of this collection was then displayed in the city from 1854. In 1937 the Provincial Museum opened in Hasselt where the most important pieces of the Tongeren collection were exhibited. In 1954 the Provincial Gallo-Roman Museum was opened in Tongeren.

The collection was expanded through donations and digs carried out by the museum itself and the Nationale Dienst voor Opgravingen (National Department for Excavations).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archief.onroerenderfgoed.be/nationale-dienst-voor-opgravingen;isaar Archive of the Real Estate Agency of Belgium]&lt;/ref&gt; After public pressure for a new home for the collection, a new building by architect Alfredo de Gregorio was opened in 1994. This new building with new and expanded exhibition areas resulted in an increase in the number of visitors. The site was further expanded in 2006.

The permanent exhibition starts with the first humanoids in the region, the Neanderthals. It presents following cultures of hunters and several waves of farmers. The third floor is dedicated to the [[Gallo-Roman culture]] located in [[Tongeren]]. The exhibition closes with the first signs of Christianity.

==Awards==
In 2011, the museum was awarded the European Museum of the Year Award and was the first Belgian museum to receive this award.

In 2014 the museum was awarded the Museum Prize worth 5,000 euros. The jury praised the way in which "the Gallo-Roman Museum has been true to the discipline of archaeology in all its forms for many years". In addition, according to the jury, "the museum knows how to host exhibitions that reach a lot of the public and establishes a broad pedagogy with attention to different target groups".

In 2016, the museum won the Romulus Prize "for the massive efforts the museum provides to map Rome, Romans and ancient times in our country".

'''Georgios Alogoskoufis''' ({{lang-el|Γιώργος Αλογοσκούφης}}) (born 17 October 1955&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://www.parliament.gr/english/synthesh/mp.asp?MPID=361 Curriculum Vitae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311045012/http://www.parliament.gr/english/synthesh/mp.asp?MPID=361 |date=2007-03-11 }} at Hellenic Parliament website.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Professor of Economics at the Athens University of Economics and Business since 1990. He was a member of the Hellenic Parliament from September 1996 till October 2009 and served as Greece's Minister of Economy and Finance from March 2004 till January 2009.

During 2004-2008 Greece's economic performance seemed extremely positive. The average growth rate was 4% per annum, unemployment fell from 10.5% in 2004 to 7.7% in 2008 just changing the way of measuring it, and public debt increased from 180 bil euro to 300 bil euro. Alogoskoufis initiated a number of policy reforms, such as the simplification of the Greek tax system such as revoking inheritance taxes for rich people, extensive privatisations, create 700 new government institutions to hire more people to the public section, export promotion, public/private partnerships etc. His supporters point out that problems for the Greek economy appeared after Alogoskoufis was replaced as minister, at the end of 2008, and especially after the change in government in October 2010. These problems appeared because of structural weaknesses in the Greek economy, such as the high public debt that was accumulated during the 1980s, the financial crisis and the partial reversal of the policies that Alogoskoufis pursued, by his successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2010/index_en.htm|title = Data of the EU Parliament|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background, academic and political career==

George Alogoskoufis was born in [[Athens]] on 17 October 1955.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

==The economic policy mix applied under the leadership of Alogoskoufis==

In the period in which Alogoskoufis served as the minister for Economy and Finance, he actuated a series of economic structural reforms and [[fiscal adjustment]] to contain budget deficits, which, although unpopular, have managed to slash Greece's budget deficit to 2.6% of the gross domestic product. In the same period of time, Greece's gross domestic product has grown with a 4%, maintaining one of the highest growth rates in the Eurozone. Although unemployment had fallen from 11% to 9% in the period between 2004 and 2007, just changing the way of measuring it, it remains one of the highest in Europe.&lt;ref name=europeanvoice&gt;[https://archive.is/20070625075816/http://www.europeanvoice.com/archive/article.asp?id=28016 "The Minister of Sound"] Article about G.

During 2004–2007, corporate and personal income taxes were reduced for rich people from 45% to 40% and increased for poor people from 12% to 29% and the tax system was simplified with the tax reform such as revoking inheritance taxes for rich people.&lt;ref name=tax_reform&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnec.gr/en/metarithmisi/forol_metarithmisi/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328182650/http://www.mnec.gr/en/metarithmisi/forol_metarithmisi/ |archivedate=2008-03-28 |df= }} Corporate and personal income taxes reduction&lt;/ref&gt; He worked extensively with the private sector &lt;ref name=PPPs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdit.mnec.gr/en/projects/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414192448/http://www.sdit.mnec.gr/en/projects/ |archivedate=2008-04-14 |df= }} List of PuPlic Private Partnership projects&lt;/ref&gt; and sold over euro 6 billion of government holdings.&lt;ref name=Privatizationss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnec.gr/export/sites/mnec/en/metarithmisi/Privatisation_Programme/01_table_Privatisation_Revenues.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414151213/http://www.mnec.gr/export/sites/mnec/en/metarithmisi/Privatisation_Programme/01_table_Privatisation_Revenues.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-14 |df= }} Table of Privatization revenues&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] [[new religious movement]] of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], various publications identify a number of [[Religious holiday|holiday]]s, to some extent based on  medieval references to sacrifices observed in historical [[Norse paganism]] or reconstructions of an early [[Germanic calendar]], but frequently also inspired by the "[[Wheel of the Year]]" popular in [[Wicca]], and sometimes also based on ''ad hoc'' innovation, e.g. the various "Days of Remembrance" introduced by ''[[The Troth]]''.

As a minimal consensus, the three great seasonal [[blot (sacrifice)|blots]] mentioned in [[Ynglingasaga]] are recognized by practically all adherents. These are: [[Winter Nights]] (in October, in some Icelandic sagas identified with [[Dísablót]]), [[Midwinter]] (some time in December or January, often identified with [[Yule]]) and [[Sigrblot]] (some time in summer). Beyond this, the modern Icelandic festival of [[Þorrablót]] is sometimes considered a "pagan holiday".

Suggestions for rituals suited for these various holidays were published by e.g. [[Edred Thorsson]], ''A Book of Troth'' (1989) and by Kveldulf Gundarsson, ''Teutonic Religion'' (1993). 
James Chisholm (1989) published a suggestion for [[Ostara]]&lt;ref&gt;James Chisholm, "The Rites of Ostara: Possibilities for Today", ''Idunna'' 1, no. 4 (February 1989), 7-10. Chisholm argued for the reconstruction of the "sacred dramas" which he saw reflected in some Eddaic poems, although shorn of their sexual content by the Christian redactors. The revived neopagan ritual was again to be modified to suit "contemporary American sensibilities". Jeffrey Kaplan, ''Radical religion in America: millenarian movements from the far right to the children of Noah'', Syracuse University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-8156-0396-2}}, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asatru Free Assembly==
The seminal organization of American Heathenry was [[Asatru Free Assembly]], founded in 1974 by [[Stephen McNallen]].
The first attempt to provide a "Germanic" version of the Wiccan Wheel of the Year was made by McNallen in desktop-published documents  between 1975-1976.

|-
|}

The name "Yule" coincides with the Wiccan ''Wheel'' as the name has been taken by Wicca from the Germanic tradition in the first place. 
McNallen's "Summer Finding" later came to be popularly called [[Ostara]] both in Wicca and in Asatru.
For the remaining items (other than "Midsummer"), McNallen sought to replace the Gaelic name used by Wiccans with a Germanic-inspired alternative.

==Puryear==
Puryear (2006) constructs an "eight-spoked Yule, also called ''achtwung''", also paralleling the eight holidays in the [[Wheel of the Year]] in [[Wicca]], but with slight differences to McNallen's 1970s version:
[[Disting]], [[Ostara]], [[Beltaine]], [[Midsummer]], [[Lammas|Hleifblot]], [[Haustblot]], [[Winter Nights|Vetrablot]], [[Yule]].
&lt;ref&gt;
Mark Puryear, ''The Nature of Asatru: An Overview of the Ideals and Philosophy of the Indigenous Religion of Northern Europe'',	iUniverse, 2006, p. 214.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Of these eight names, Ostara, Beltaine, Midsummer and Yule coincide with the Wiccan "Wheel". 
The remaining four, Disting, Hleifblot, Haustblot and Vetrablot, correspond to Wiccan [[Imbolc]], [[Lughnasadh]], [[Mabon (Wicca)|Mabon]] and [[Samhain]], respectively.

Puryear (p.&amp;nbsp;186) mentions "Charming of the Plow" it as an "alternate name" for  [[Disting]], which he in turn identifies with the "midwinter sacrifice"

==The Troth==
The handbook ''Our Troth'' in its second edition, published by [[The Troth]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;BookSurge, {{ISBN|978-1-4196-3598-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
likewise lists eight festivals: [[Yule]], [[Þorrablót]], [[Idis-Þing]], [[Ostara]] (Sigrblót), [[Waluburg's Night]], [[Midsummer]], [[Lammas|Loaf-Fest]] (Freyfaxi) and [[Winter-Nights]] ([[Álfablót|Alf-Blessing]], [[Dísablót|Idis-Blessing]], Frey-Blessing).
These eight festivals are not, however, evenly distributed throughout the year as the Wiccan "Wheel of the Year".
The handbook takes as its starting-point the statement in the ''[[Heimskringla]]''
on the three major holidays,  Winter Nights, Yule, and Sigrblót (identified with Ostara), set in October, December and April, respectively.
Midsummer is added as a fourth festival in the absence of Eddaic evidence because its popularity in modern Scandinavian folklore. The remaining four holidays are listead as the "lesser blessings".
In addition, ''Our Troth'' cites a number of "Days of Remembrance" dedicated to various Eddaic heroes introduced by modern [[Ásatrú in the United States]].

The '''Hospital del Divino Salvador''' was the first hospital established in [[Mexico City]] for the treatment of mentally ill women.

==History==

It was founded by José de Sáyago and archbishop Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas by the year of 1687. By the death of the archbishop, the hospital, was sponsored by El Divino Salvador congregation. This congregation was founded in La Casa Profesa of the [[Society of Jesus]].

The congregation moved the hospital's premises to a better location, in this case a house at La Canoa street (Donceles street) by the year 1700. The congregation maintained the hospital as one of the best of its kind in the treatment of mentally ill women. By the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus]] in 1767 the hospital became part of the Real Patronato, nevertheless the quality of the services given at the hospital were never the same as the ones given by the jesuits.

In the early 19th century, the Viceroy [[Felix Berenguer de Marquina]] decided to redesign the hospital's premises. This works would be completed in 1809. By the independence of [[New Spain|Nueva España]] the hospital passed into the hands of the City and in 1847 to the care of the Sisters of Charity.

In the year 1910 the women at the hospital were moved to the new General Asylum "la Castañeda". The new hospital built under the leadership of [[Porfirio Díaz]] in the framework for the celebrations for the first centenary of the [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence of Mexico]].

Currently the building houses offices of the Secretary of Health and the historical record of the institution. The building is still standing in Donceles street at the [[Historic center of Mexico City]].

'''''Il Postino''''' is an [[opera]] in three acts by [[Daniel Catán]] with a Spanish [[libretto]] by the composer. Based on the novel '' [[Ardiente paciencia]]'' by [[Antonio Skármeta]] and the film ''[[Il Postino]]'' by [[Michael Radford]], the work contains elements of drama and comedy, integrating themes of love and friendship along with political and spiritual conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.operasaratoga.org/il-postino/|title=''Il Postino''|publisher=[[Opera Saratoga]]|access-date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opera premiered at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] by [[Los Angeles Opera]] on 23 September 2010.&lt;ref name="OA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.operaamerica.org/applications/nawd/newworks/details.aspx?id=1037|title=''Il Postino'' – North American Works Directory|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Opera America]]|access-date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Set on a small Italian island, exiled Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] receives so much fan mail that a personal postman, Mario Ruoppolo, is hired to deliver his letters. Mario, smitten by Beatrice Russo, turns to Pablo for help writing poetry that would help him win the heart of the woman he longs for. Soon after, Mario and the barmaid fall in love and wed. In the third act, influenced by Pablo's works, Mario begins writing political poems and while reciting at a communist demonstration, violence breaks out and he receives a gunshot wound, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.operatheater.org/wp4/il-postino-synopsis/ |title=''Il Postino'' Synopsis – Center City Opera Theater |website=www.operatheater.org |access-date=6 October 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110144522/http://www.operatheater.org/wp4/il-postino-synopsis/ |archivedate=10 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and performance history==
''Il Postino'' was the fifth and last of Daniel Catán's operas and the first one for which he had also written the libretto. His route to creating the work began when he first saw the 1994 film ''Il Postino'' and thought it would make a good opera. However, at the time he was in the midst of composing ''[[Florencia en el Amazonas]]'' and then received a commission from Houston Grand Opera for his fourth opera ''[[Salsipuedes: a Tale of Love, War and Anchovies|Salsipuedes]]'' which premiered in 2004. After completing that work, he returned to the ''Postino'' project. In an interview shortly before the premiere Catán said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's rare that an idea I had 15 years ago resurfaces, then I take it on, because one changes so much in that time. But when I came back to this idea, in fact I was still interested in it, but for different reasons. Instead of identifying with the Mario character, with the young aspiring poet, in fact now I could see the story from the other point of view, which was of the older poet.&lt;ref name = "Mangan"&gt;Mangan, Timothy (21 September 2010).

Discussions with Plácido Domingo who had become the General Director of Los Angeles Opera in 2003 led to a commission from the company which was announced in 2005. The premiere was to have taken place in the 2009 season starring Domingo as the poet Neruda and [[Rolando Villazón]] as Mario. However, financial difficulties at Los Angeles Opera caused the postponement of the premiere until the following season. In the interim, Villazón, who was recovering from surgery on his vocal chords, withdrew from the production and was eventually replaced by [[Charles Castronovo]].&lt;ref name = "Swed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pasles, Chris (23 July 2005).

The opera finally premiered on 23 September 2010 as the opening production of the 2010 season. It was conducted by [[Grant Gershon]] and directed by Ron Daniels with sets and costumes designed by Riccardo Hernandez.

==Libretto==
[[File:Soong Ching-ling and Pablo Neruda - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Pablo Neruda]] in 1951]]
In writing the libretto, Catán followed the plot of the [[Michael Radford]]'s Italian film ''[[Il Postino]]'' (and its attendant anachronisms) quite faithfully, but he also used [[Antonio Skármeta]]'s 1985 novel ''[[Ardiente paciencia]]'' (on which the film had been based) to develop the characterization of [[Pablo Neruda]].&lt;ref name = "Loomis" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Blum"&gt;Blum, Ronald (24 September 2010).

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' via [[Associated Press]]. Retrieved 6 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The actor [[Massimo Troisi]], who played the title role in the film and died shortly after it was completed, owned the rights to the screenplay and had willed them to his five siblings. Once Catán had decided on the ''Postino'' project, he visited each of them personally to secure the adaptation rights rather than relying on lawyers. According to Catán's son, he had almost completely formulated the characterisations of the principal singers before he began the actual composition, and the libretto manuscripts contained relatively few revisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, David Patrick (17 April 2011).

The entirely fictional story of Neruda and his postman is told in both the film and Skármeta's novel. However, there are several key differences between the novel and both the film and the opera. ''Ardiente paciencia'' is set in Chile during the rise and fall of the Allende Government in the early 1970s with Neruda and his wife [[Matilde Urrutia|Matilde]] living in their house at [[Isla Negra]], on the Chilean coast. The film and opera move the locale from Chile to a fictional Italian island and the time to the early 1950s. Although Neruda and Matilde (who were not yet married) did sojourn to Italy during his exile from Chile and stayed on the [[Capri|Isle of Capri]] on-and-off between 1951 and 1952, they were guests in [[Edwin Cerio]]'s villa there and did not have their own house. At that time Neruda had not yet achieved the world-wide fame as a poet that he had by the early 1970s when he won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neruda "Neruda"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''. Retrieved 6 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The poems quoted in both the film and the opera were written several years after he returned to Chile.

Like all of Catán's previous operas, the libretto was in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin, Nicholas Ivor |title=The Opera Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZYKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 |year=2013 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-8869-2 |page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 essay published in ''Revista de Musicología'', he wrote of his dream to establish a strong tradition of Spanish-language opera, which was still lacking in both Spain and Latin America. At the time, he was working on the libretto for ''Il Postino'' and wrote:

Miramax also organized and sponsored poetry readings around the US in conjunction with [[Copper Canyon Press]] who had recently published several volumes of Neruda's poetry in English translation.&lt;ref name = "Hodgson" /&gt;}} I will now take back ''Il Postino''.

==Synopsis==
Setting: The fictional Italian island of Cala di Sotto during the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Synopsis based on Large, Brian (2012). Liner Notes, ''Il Postino'' DVD. [[Sony Classical]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 1===
[[File:Salina landscape2.jpg|thumb|The [[Salina, Sicily|Island of Salina]], used in the film ''[[Il Postino]]'' as the setting for the fictional island of Cala di Sotto]]
''Prelude''&lt;br&gt;
Di Cosimo, a politician running for office on the island, sings a nationalist song. Soon after, an announcement is made on the radio stating that Pablo Neruda, a great Chilean poet, has arrived in Rome. Exiled, he will live on the island of Cala di Sotto.

''Scene 1: "No papá, no hay agua"''&lt;br&gt;
In his bedroom, Mario describes to his father how much he dislikes working as a fisherman. He then reveals that he has found a new job working as a postman.

''Scene 2: "Tus manos…"''&lt;br&gt;
The following day, Pablo is reading on the patio when is wife Matilde arrives. Embracing her, he poetically sings "Desnuda" ("Nude"), relating her and her body to the beauty of nature.

''Scene 3: "Buenos dias…su correo"''&lt;br&gt;
Mario arrives, delivering Pablo's mail. Catching the couple in an embrace, Pablo quickly turns to Mario and collects his mail, meeting him for the first time.

''Scene 4: "Mujer! Mujer!"''&lt;br&gt;
At the post office, Mario sits with postmaster Giorgio, examining the letters to be delivered to Pablo. Discovering that most of the letters are from women, Mario tells Giorgio that he bought one of Pablo's books and wants to have it signed so that he can impress others.
{{listen |filename=Daniel_Catan_-_Il_Postino_-_Act_I_-_Desnuda.ogg |title=''Desnuda'' from Act 1, Scene 2 |description=Pablo Neruda singing ''Desnuda'' to his wife Matilde }}
''Scene 5: "Correo! Correo!"''&lt;br&gt;
During the next delivery, Mario tells Pablo that he wants to become a poet so that he too can have women fall in love with him. Pablo tells him to observe the world around him and discover its metaphors. Using the sea as an example, Pablo sings "Oda al mar" ("Ode to the Sea"), describing the blue water as it spills and moves. Mario soon begins to understand Pablo's words in the duet "Metaforas" ("Metaphors").

''Scene 6: Romanza''&lt;br&gt;
The barmaid Beatrice Russo is introduced, singing a romanza while working in a local café. Mario, taken by her beauty, approaches her. The two play a game of table soccer and Beatrice beats him handily. Mario learns her name.

''Scene 7: "Don Pablo!"''&lt;br&gt;
Pablo arrives at the docks. Mario, holding a delivery of mail, runs to him and confesses that he is in love with Beatrice. Pablo laughs. Mario asks him for help writing a poem to impress Beatrice but Pablo declines as he does not know her. Giving Pablo his mail, Mario declines payment.

''Scene 8: "Ya duerme el mar"''&lt;br&gt;
In chorus, the dockworkers sing of the sea.

===Act 2===
[[File:Il Postino Neruda-movie set - cropped.jpg|thumb|The house on the Island of Salina used as the setting for Neruda's house in the film ''[[Il Postino]]'']]
''Scene 1: "Que haces?"''&lt;br&gt;
Beatrice is in her bedroom thinking of Mario. Her aunt, Donna Rosa enters the room and is displeased by her niece's contact with the younger man. Beatrice, falling in love with Mario, tells her aunt that he spoke to her in metaphors. Soon they argue over Mario's intentions and Donna Rosa finds a letter from Mario. She takes it away and leaves the room.

''Scene 2: "Tus manos..."''&lt;br&gt;
Di Cosimo, seeking votes at the next election, promises to bring water to the island. Giorgio and others complain that he's been promising this for years. Di Cosimo calls them liars and states that it wasn't him making the promises. Excited at the prospect of workers coming to the island and becoming customers, Donna Rosa pledges her support for Di Cosimo.

''Scene 3: Love Duet #1''&lt;br&gt;
Mario approaches Beatrice in the evening, singing more metaphors in an effort to impress her. Influenced by her aunt, Beatrice is reluctant to accept Mario's advances.

''Scene 4: "Te caíste de la cama"''&lt;br&gt;
In his next delivery, Mario brings Pablo an audio reel. Pablo gives him a book that will help him with his metaphors, then introduces him to a sound recorder. The device plays, telling them that Pablo's book is a big success in Chile and will be re-printed.

''Scene 5: "Léamela Padre"''&lt;br&gt;
Distressed, Donna Rosa runs to the priest and gives him Mario's letter to read. Upon hearing the letter, Donna Rosa is horrified by the contents of the poetry written to Beatrice.
{{listen |filename=Daniel_Catan_-_Il_Postino_-_Act_II_-_Love_Duet_-2.ogg |title=''Love Duet #2'' from Act 2, Scene 6 |description=The second love duet sung by Mario and Beatrice }}
''Scene 6: Love Duet #2''&lt;br&gt;
Mario and Beatrice meet in the night, sharing an embrace. With a gun, Donna Rosa comes looking for them, calling out for her niece. Mario and Beatrice share a kiss and Beatrice runs away.

''Scene 7: "Chile la sangre de tus hijos"''&lt;br&gt;
Pablo receives a letter from Chile telling him that there is more bloodshed.

==Critical reception==
The critics writing on both the American and the Austrian premieres remarked on the "unapologetically" melodious nature of the score and noted that it was reminiscent of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], both in the instrumental colors of the orchestral interludes and in the arias, singling out particularly the writing for the woodwinds and strings.&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Taylor" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Blum" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Loomis" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Swed" /&gt; In his review of the Austrian premiere [[George Loomis]] wrote that like Catán's previous operas, the score was marked by a "musical shapeliness" and a "capacity to soar and [...] move the listener." He also summarized the mixed critical reception in the German and Austrian press noting that the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' pronounced it "a triumph" but ''[[Die Presse]]'' described the opera's story as "smothered in operatic sugar-icing", with more than one review describing it as [[kitsch]].&lt;ref name = "Loomis" /&gt; [[Anne Midgette]] wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that "the language spoken by Catán's lovely score is universal: the safely melodious terrain of international opera."&lt;ref name = "Midgette" /&gt; It was a view echoed by Joshua Kosman in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' who described the opera as a "lovely though limited" work and wrote that "operagoers who complain that they don't write 'em like they used to can take comfort from ''Il Postino''".&lt;ref&gt;Kosman, Joshua (25 September 2010).

'''Jan Janszoon van Haarlem''', commonly known as '''Murat Reis the Younger''' (c. 1570 – c. 1641), was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] pirate who "turned Turk" after being captured by a Moorish state in 1618. He began serving as a [[Barbary pirates|Barbary pirate]], one of the most famous of the 17th-century "[[Salé Rovers]]". Together with other corsairs, he helped establish the independent [[Republic of Salé]] at the city of that name, serving as the first President and Grand Admiral. He also served as Governor of [[Oualidia]].

==Early life==
Jan Janszoon van Haerlem was born in [[Haarlem]] in 1575, which was in [[Holland]], then a province ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The [[Eighty Years War]] between Dutch rebels and the [[Spanish Empire]] under king Philip II had started seven years before his birth; it lasted all his life. Little is known of his early life. He married Soutgen Cave in 1595 and had two children with her, Edward and Lysbeth. 

After her death, around 1600 he married or had a union with Margarita, a [[Moors|Moorish]] woman in [[Cartagena, Spain]]. They had four sons together: Abraham, [[Anthony Janszoon van Salee|Anthony]], Phillip, and Cornelis.

==Privateering==
In 1600, Jan Janszoon began as a Dutch [[privateer]] sailing from his home port of [[Haarlem]], working for the state with letters of marque to harass Spanish shipping during the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Janszoon overstepped the boundaries of his letters and found his way to the semi-independent port states of the [[Barbary Coast]] of north Africa, whence he could attack ships of every foreign state: when he attacked a Spanish ship, he flew the Dutch flag; when he attacked any other, he became an Ottoman Captain and flew the red half-moon of the Turks or the flag of any of various other Mediterranean principalities. During this period, he had abandoned his Dutch family.&lt;ref&gt;Karg and Spaite (2007): 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture by Barbary corsairs==
[[File:Sail plan xebec.svg|thumb|left|140px|[[Sail]] plan for a [[Polacca]], first built by the Barbary pirates around the 16th century, many scholars believe the [[Polacca]] was extensively used by Jan Janszoon. The ship could sail with a large crew of 75 and was armed with 24 [[cannons]]]]

Janszoon was captured in 1618 at [[Lanzarote]] (one of the [[Canary Islands]]) by [[Barbary corsairs]] and taken to [[Algiers]] as a captive.  There he "turned Turk", or [[Muslim]]. Some historians speculate that the conversion was forced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SJEg0p4RCP4C&amp;pg=PA97 "Murad Rais"], ''Pirate Utopias'', p.96, Retrieved 29 sept 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Janszoon himself, however, tried very hard to convert his fellow Europeans who were Christian to become Muslim and was a passionate Muslim missionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=F-_lr6ozg5cC&amp;pg=PA24|title=The Devil's Anarchy: The Sea Robberies of the Most Famous Pirate Claes G. Compaen|author=Stephen Snelders|page=24|quote=After his conversion, Jansz. proselytized actively for his new faith, trying to convert Christian slaves...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Turks maintained a precarious measure of influence on behalf of their [[Sultan]] by openly encouraging the [[Moors]] to advance themselves through piracy against the European powers, which long resented the Ottoman Empire.  After Janszoon's conversion to [[Islam]] and the ways of his captors, he sailed with the famous corsair Sulayman Rais, also known as Slemen Reis. (He was a Dutchman named [[De Veenboer]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeerovery.nl/history/veenboer.htm "De Veenboer"], Zeerovery, Retrieved 29 sept 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; whom Janszoon had known before his capture and who,&lt;ref name="Murad Reis, p. 36"&gt;"Murad Reis", p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; had chosen to convert to Islam). They were accompanied by [[Simon de Danser]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  But, because [[Algiers]] had concluded peace with several European nations, it was no longer a suitable port from which to sell captured ships or their cargo.  So, after Sulayman Rais was killed by a cannonball in 1619, Janszoon moved to the ancient port of [[Salé]] and began operating from it as a [[Barbary Coast|Barbary]] corsair.

==Republic of Salé==
[[File:1600s.sale.morocco.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Salé]] in the 1600s]]
{{main|Republic of Salé}}

In 1619, [[Salé Rovers]] declared the port to be an independent republic free from the Sultan. They set up a government that consisted of 14 pirate leaders, and elected Janszoon as their President. He would also serve as the Grand Admiral, known as Murat Reis, of their navy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SJEg0p4RCP4C&amp;pg=PA206 "Murad Reis"], ''Pirate Utopias'', p. 97, Retrieved 30 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Salé fleet totaled about eighteen ships, all small because of the very shallow harbor entrance.

After an unsuccessful siege of the city, the Sultan of Morocco acknowledged its semi-autonomy. Contrary to popular belief that Sultan [[Zidan Abu Maali]] had reclaimed sovereignty over Salé and appointed Janszoon the Governor in 1624, the Sultan acknowledged Janszoon's election as president by formally appointing him as his ceremonial governor.&lt;ref&gt;"Murad Rais", p.98&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:El Badi Palace by Adriaen Matham 1640.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The walls of [[Marrakesh]] and [[El Badi Palace]], by [[Adriaen Matham]], 1640.]]
Under Janszoon's leadership, business in Salé thrived. The main sources of income of this republic remained piracy and its by-trades, shipping and dealing in stolen property. Historians have noted Janszoon's intelligence and bravery, which were expressed in his leadership ability. He was forced to find an assistant to keep up, resulting in the hiring of a fellow countryman from The Netherlands, Mathys van Bostel Oosterlinck, who would serve as his Vice-Admiral.&lt;ref&gt;"Murad Rais", p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Janszoon had become very wealthy from his income as pirate admiral, payments for anchorage and other harbor dues, and the brokerage of stolen goods.  The political climate in Salé worsened toward the end of 1627, so Janszoon quietly moved his family and his entire operation back to semi-independent Algiers.

===Plea from his Dutch family===
Janszoon became bored by his new official duties from time to time and again sail away on a pirate adventure.  In 1622, Janszoon and his crews sailed into the [[English Channel]] with no particular plan but to try their luck there.  When they ran low on supplies, they docked at the port of [[Veere]], [[Zeeland]], under the Moroccan flag, claiming diplomatic privileges from his official role as Admiral of Morocco (a very loose term in the environment of North African politics).  The Dutch authorities could not deny the two ships access to Veere because, at the time, several peace treaties and trade agreements existed between the Sultan of Morocco and the [[Dutch Republic]].  During Janszoon's anchorage there, the Dutch authorities brought his Dutch first wife and children to the port to try to persuade him to give up piracy. Such strategies utterly failed with the men.&lt;ref&gt;"Murad Rais", p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Janszoon and his crews left port with many new Dutch volunteers, despite a Dutch prohibition of piracy.

==Diplomacy==

===Dutch captives===
While in Morocco, Janszoon worked to secure release of Dutch captives from other pirates and prevent their being sold into slavery.&lt;ref name=VS /&gt;

===Franco-Moroccan Treaty of 1631===
Knowledgeable of several languages, while in Algiers he contributed to the establishment of the [[Franco-Moroccan Treaty (1631)|Franco-Moroccan Treaty of 1631]] between [[List of French monarchs|French King]] [[Louis XIII]] and Sultan [[Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik II]].&lt;ref name=VS /&gt;

==Notable raids==
[[File:Oluf Eigilsson Murat Reis 1627-1628.jpg|thumb|[[Ólafur Egilsson]] was captured by Murat Reis the Younger]]

===Lundy===
In 1627 Janszoon captured the island of [[Lundy]] in the [[Bristol Channel]] and held it for five years, using it as a base for raiding expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Piracy: The Complete History |last=Konstam |first=Angus |authorlink=Angus Konstam |year=2008 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location= |isbn=1-84603-240-7 |pages=90–91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=USiyy1ZA-BsC&amp;pg=PA90 |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grindavík===
In 1627, Janszoon used a [[Denmark|Danish]] "slave" (most likely a crew member captured on a Danish ship taken as a pirate prize) to pilot him and his men to [[Iceland]]. There they raided the fishing village of [[Grindavík]]. Their takings were meagre, some salted fish and a few hides, but they also captured twelve Icelanders and three Danes who happened to be in the village. When they were leaving Grindavík, they managed to trick and capture a Danish merchant ship that was passing by means of flying a false flag.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The ships sailed to [[Bessastaðir]], seat of the Danish governor of Iceland, to raid but were unable to make a landing - it is said they were thwarted by cannon fire from the local fortifications (''Bessastaðaskans'') and a quickly mustered group of [[lancer]]s from the [[Southern Peninsula (Iceland)|Southern Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Vilhjálmur Þ. Gíslason, ''Bessastaðir: Þættir úr sögu höfuðbóls''. Akureyri. 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to sail home to Salé, where they sold their captives as slaves.

Two corsair ships from Algiers, possibly connected to Janszoon's raid, came to Iceland on July 4 and plundered there. Then they sailed to Vestmannaeyjar off the southern coast and raided there for three days. Those events are collectively known in Iceland as ''Tyrkjaránið'' (the [[Turkish Abductions|Turkish abductions]]), as the Barbary states were nominally a part of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reisubok.net/Foreword/default.aspx ''The Travels of Reverend Ólafur Egilsson''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106021203/http://reisubok.net/Foreword/default.aspx |date=2014-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts by enslaved Icelanders who spent time on the corsair ships claimed that the conditions for women and children were normal, in that they were permitted to move throughout the ship, except to the quarter deck. The pirates were seen giving extra food to the children from their own private stashes. A woman who gave birth on board a ship was treated with dignity, being afforded privacy and clothing by the pirates. The men were put in the hold of the ships, and had their chains removed once the ships were far enough from land. Despite popular claims about treatment of captives, Icelander accounts do not mention that slaves were raped.&lt;ref&gt;"Murad Rais", p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guðríður Símonardóttir]] and a few other captives are known to have returned to Iceland.

===Sack of Baltimore, Ireland===
Having sailed for two months and with little to show for the voyage, Janszoon turned to a captive taken on the voyage, a [[Roman Catholic]] named John Hackett, for information on where a profitable raid could be made. The Protestant residents of Baltimore, a small town in [[West Cork]], Ireland, were resented by the Roman Catholic native Irish because they were [[Plantations of Ireland|settled on lands confiscated]] from the O'Driscoll clan. Hackett directed Janszoon to this town and away from his own. Janszoon [[Sack of Baltimore|sacked Baltimore]] on June 20, 1631, seizing little property but taking 108 captives, whom he sold as slaves in North Africa. Janszoon was said to have released the Irish, and taken only English captives. Shortly after the sack, Hackett was arrested and hanged for his crime.&lt;!-- where? did he stay in Ireland? --&gt; "Here was not a single Christian who was not weeping and who was not full of sadness at the sight of so many honest maidens and so many good women abandoned to the brutality of these barbarians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekin|first=Des|title=The Stolen Village|year=2006|publisher=OBrien|isbn=978-0-86278-955-8|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two of the villagers ever returned to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;"Murad Rais", p. 121, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raids in the Mediterranean Sea===
Murat Reis chose to make large profits by raiding Mediterranean islands such as the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], and the southern coast of [[Sicily]]. He often sold most of his merchandise in [[Tunis]], where he befriended the [[Dey]]. He is known to have sailed the [[Ionian Sea]]. He fought the Venetians near the coasts of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]] with a corsair crew consisting of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Moriscos]], [[Arab]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and elite [[Janissaries]].

==Capture by Knights of Malta==
[[File:St. Angelo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Saint Angelo]] in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]
In 1635, near the [[Tunisia]]n coast, Murat Reis was outnumbered and surprised by a sudden attack. He and many of his men were captured by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]. He was imprisoned in the island's notorious dark [[dungeon]]s. He was mistreated and [[torture]]d, and suffered ill health due to his time in the dungeon. In 1640 he barely escaped after a massive Corsair attack, which was carefully planned by the [[Dey]] of [[Tunis]] in order to rescue their fellow sailors and Corsairs. He was greatly honored and praised upon his return in Morocco and the nearby [[Barbary States]].

==Escape and return to Morocco==
After Janzsoon returned to Morocco in 1640, he was appointed as Governor of the great fortress of [[Oualidia]], near [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]].  He resided at the Castle of Maladia. In December 1640, a ship arrived with a new Dutch consul, who brought Lysbeth Janszoon van Haarlem, Janszoon's daughter by his Dutch wife, to visit her father.  When Lysbeth arrived, Janszoon "was seated in great pomp on a carpet, with silk cushions, the servants all around him".&lt;ref&gt;"Murad Rais", p.140&lt;/ref&gt; She saw that Murat Reis had become a feeble, old man. Lysbeth stayed with her father until August 1641, when she returned to Holland. Little is known of Janszoon thereafter; he likely retired at last from both public life and piracy. The date of his death remains unknown.

==Marriages and issue==
In 1596, by an unknown Dutch woman, Janszoon's first child was born, Lysbeth Janszoon van Haarlem.

After becoming a privateer, Janszoon met an unknown woman in [[Cartagena, Spain]], who he would marry. The identity of this woman is historically vague, but the consensus is that she was of multi-ethnic background, considered "Moorish" in Spain. Historians have claimed her to be nothing more than a concubine, others claim she was a Muslim [[Mudéjar]] who worked for a Christian noble family, and other claims have been made that she was a "Moorish princess."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SJEg0p4RCP4C&amp;pg=PA206 "Anthony Jansen van Salee"], Pirate Utopias, p. 206, Retrieved 29 sept 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this marriage, Janszoon had four children: Abraham Janszoon van Salee (b.1602), Philip Janszoon van Salee (b. 1604), [[Anthony Janszoon van Salee]] (b.1607), and Cornelis Janszoon van Salee (b. 1608).

It is speculated that Janszoon married for a third time to the daughter of [[Sultan]] Moulay Ziden in 1624.&lt;ref name=VS&gt;[http://www.pcez.com/~bigshoe/dt/Vsik/salee.html "VAN SICKELEN &amp; VAN HOORN LINES continued"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001234607/http://www.pcez.com/~bigshoe/dt/Vsik/salee.html |date=2011-10-01 }}, Michael A. Shoemaker. PCEZ. Accessed 9 september 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
In 2009, a play based on Janszoon's life as a pirate, "Jan Janszoon, de blonde Arabier", written by [[Karim El Guennouni]] toured The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/7144/karim-el-guennouni-jan-janszoon-de-blonde-arabier.html "Jan Janszoon knipoogt naar het heden"], 8 Weekly, Retrieved 30 sept 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "Bad Grandpa: The Ballad of Murad the Captain" is a poem about Janszoon published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billiter.com/murad.htm "Bad Grandpa: The Ballad of Murad the Captain"], Jim Billiter. Accessed 9 september 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Janszoon was also known as '''Murat Reis the Younger'''. His Dutch names are also given as '''Jan Jansen''' and '''Jan Jansz'''; his adopted name as '''Morat Rais''', '''Murat Rais''', '''Morat'''; ''Little John Ward'', ''John Barber'', ''Captain John'', ''Caid Morato'' were some of his pirate names. "The Hairdresser" was a nickname of Janszoon.&lt;ref name=VS /&gt;

The technically demanding Tristano greatly influenced Satriani's playing. Satriani began teaching guitar, with his most notable student at the time being fellow [[Long Island]] native [[Steve Vai]] (both also went to the same [[Carle Place High School|high school]]). While he was teaching Vai, he was attending [[Five Towns College]] for studies in music.

In 1978, Satriani moved to [[Berkeley, California]], to pursue a music career. Soon after arriving in California, he resumed teaching.

In 1987, Satriani's second album ''[[Surfing with the Alien]]'' produced radio hits and was the first all-instrumental release to chart so highly in many years. The track "Crushing Day" was featured on the soundtrack of a low-budget film titled ''[[It Takes Two (1988 film)|It Takes Two]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095384/|publisher=IMDb.com|title=It Takes Two (1988)|accessdate=2015-11-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211090917/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095384/|archivedate=December 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Surfing with the Alien'' is his most acclaimed work, according to aggregator [[Acclaimed Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/Joe%20Satriani.htm|title=Joe Satriani|work=Acclaimed Music|accessdate=March 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116201932/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/Joe%20Satriani.htm|archivedate=January 16, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Satriani helped produce the EP ''[[The Eyes of Horror]]'' for the [[death metal]] band [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]]. That same year, he also released an EP titled ''Dreaming #11'', which featured the song "The Crush of Love".  In 1989, Satriani released the album ''[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]''. It was said to be inspired by the death of his father, who died in 1989 during the recording of the album. "One Big Rush" featured on the soundtrack to the [[Cameron Crowe]] movie ''[[Say Anything...]]''. "The Forgotten Part II" was featured on a [[Labatt Blue]] commercial in Canada in 1993.

"The Bells of Lal (Part One)" was featured for an eerie scene in the 1996 [[Billy Bob Thornton]] movie ''[[Sling Blade]]'', while Carl is sharpening a lawnmower blade to kill the menacing Doyle Hargraves played by [[Dwight Yoakam]].

Joe Satriani also sang backing vocals on the self-titled [[Crowded House (album)|''Crowded House'']] album.

In 1992, Satriani released ''[[The Extremist]]'', his most commercially successful album to date. Radio stations across the country picked up "Summer Song", which got a major boost when [[Sony]] used it in a major commercial campaign for their [[Discman]] portable CD players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_rWVPRP0nQ|title=Sony CD Commercial Satriani Summer Song|publisher=YouTube|date=|accessdate=2010-08-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729202430/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_rWVPRP0nQ|archivedate=July 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cryin'", "[[Friends (Joe Satriani song)|Friends]]", and the title track were regional hits on radio. In late 1993, Satriani joined [[Deep Purple]] as a temporary replacement for departed guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]] during the band's Japanese tour. The concerts were a success, and Satriani was asked to join the band permanently, but he declined, having just signed a multialbum solo deal with [[Sony Records|Sony]], and [[Steve Morse]] took the guitarist slot in Deep Purple.&lt;ref name="Purple"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deep-purple.net/tree/mk6.htm |title=Deep Purple Mark 6 History |publisher=Deep-purple.net |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419214848/http://www.deep-purple.net/tree/mk6.htm |archivedate=April 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influence==
Satriani is considered a highly technical guitarist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-satriani-p5354/biography|title=Joe Satriani|publisher=All Music.com|accessdate=2012-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124044138/http://allmusic.com/artist/joe-satriani-p5354/biography|archivedate=January 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been referred to as a top guitar [[virtuoso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~shane/rockguitarworld/joesatriani/index.html |title=Rock Guitar World: Joe Satriani |publisher=Cs.auckland.ac.nz |accessdate=2012-10-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627093722/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~shane/rockguitarworld/joesatriani/index.html |archivedate=June 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.candyrat.com/artists/JoeSatriani/SuperColossal/ |title=CANdYRAT Records |publisher=Candyrat.com |accessdate=2012-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019125206/http://candyrat.com/artists/JoeSatriani/SuperColossal/ |archivedate=October 19, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Satriani has mastered many [[guitar technique|performance techniques]] on electric guitar, including [[legato]], two-handed [[tapping]] and [[arpeggio]] tapping, [[volume swell]]s, [[harmonics]] and extreme [[whammy bar]] effects. During [[shred guitar|fast]] passages, Satriani favors a legato technique (achieved primarily through [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s) that yields smooth and flowing runs. He is also adept at other speed-related techniques such as rapid [[alternate picking]] and [[sweep picking]]. Satriani was influenced by blues-rock guitar icons such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Brian May]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Ritchie Blackmore]], and [[Jeff Beck]],&lt;ref name="BBCI"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shrivastava |first=Rahul |title=Joe Satriani Interview |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/music/2004/06/satriani_interview.shtml |accessdate=2007-01-13 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012131412/http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/music/2004/06/satriani_interview.shtml | archivedate=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/SatrianiInterview.htm |title=Joe Satriani Interview |publisher=Metal-rules.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522214206/http://www.metal-rules.com/interviews/SatrianiInterview.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as jazz fusion guitarist [[Allan Holdsworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brown, Pete |date=July 28, 2010 |url=http://truefire.com/blog/interviews/3-questions-joe-satriani/ |title=3 Questions – Joe Satriani |publisher=''The Punch-In''.

==Equipment==
Satriani has endorsed [[Ibanez]]'s [[Ibanez JS Series|JS Series]] guitars, and [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey]]'s [[Peavey Electronics#JSX series guitar amplifiers|JSX]] [[instrument amplifier|amplifier]]. Both lines were designed specifically as signature products for Satriani. The Ibanez JS1 (the original JS model) was based on, and replaced, the Ibanez 540 Radius model that Satriani first endorsed. Many of his guitars are made by [[Ibanez]], including the JS1000, and JS1200. These guitars typically feature the [[DiMarzio]] PAF Pro (which he used up until 1993 in both the neck and bridge positions), the [[DiMarzio]] Fred (which he used in the bridge position from 1993 to 2005), and the Mo' Joe and the Paf Joe (which he uses in the bridge and neck positions, respectively, from 2005 to present day).

The JS line of guitars is his signature line with the JS1000, JS1200, JS2400, JSBDG, and JS20th using Ibanez's original Edge double locking tremolo bridge. The JS100 and JS120s both use Ibanez's Edge 3 tremolo bridge. The JS1600 is a fixed bridge guitar with no tremolo system. The guitar he was most associated with during the 90s was a chrome-finished guitar nicknamed "Chrome Boy". This instrument can be seen on the ''[[Live in San Francisco (Joe Satriani album)|Live in San Francisco]]'' DVD. However, the guitar used for most of the concert was in fact a lookalike nicknamed "Pearly," which featured [[Seymour Duncan]] Pearly Gates pickups.

Satriani uses a number of other JS models such as the JS double neck model, JS700 (primary axe on the self-titled CD and seen on the 1995 tour "Joe Satriani," which features a fixed bridge, [[P-90]] pickups, and a matching mahogany body and neck), JS6/JS6000 (natural body), JS1 (the original JS model), JS2000 (fixed bridge model), a variety of JS100s, JS1000s and JS1200s with custom paint work, and a large amount of prototype JSs. All double locking bridges have been the original Edge tremolo, not the newer models, which point to a more custom guitar than the "off the shelf" models. Satriani played a red 7-string JS model, seen in the "G3 Live in Tokyo" DVD from 2005. He also has a prototype 24-fret version of the JS—now called the JS-2400—which he has used with Chickenfoot. As of late he has used other prototypes featuring a Sustainer or a JS model with three single coil-sized humbucker pickups.

Satriani's guitars are usually equipped with his signature DiMarzio humbucker pickups, Mo' Joe and PAF Joe, and his 24-fret JS model features a signature single-coil sized humbucker called the Satch Track in the neck position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DiMarzio Releases Satch Track, Joe Satriani's First Single-Coil-Size Signature Pickup|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/dimarzio-releases-satch-track-joe-satrianis-first-single-coil-size-signature-pickup|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420212901/http://www.guitarworld.com/dimarzio-releases-satch-track-joe-satrianis-first-single-coil-size-signature-pickup|archivedate=April 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his guitars are still equipped with the pickup models he favored in the past, the DiMarzio FRED and PAF Pro pickups.

Satriani has used a wide variety of [[guitar amps]], using [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] for his main amplifier (notably the limited edition blue coloured 6100 LM model) up until 2001, and his Peavey signature series amps, the Peavey JSX, up until his time with Chickenfoot.

[[File:JS Guitars 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Guitars used by Satriani during the 2013 ''[[Unstoppable Momentum]]'' tour.]]
The JSX began life as a prototype Peavey XXX and developed into the Joe Satriani signature Peavey model. However he still used distortion pedals with the clean channel rather than the built-in overdrive channels. Satriani has used other amplifiers over the years in the studio, such as the Peavey 5150 (used to record the song '[[Crystal Planet]]'), Cornford, and the [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark IIC+ (used to record the song '[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]'), amongst others. He has recently switched to the Marshall JVM series, having used a modified JVM 410H in his Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards tour in 2010 and with Chickenfoot in 2010 and 2011.

These modified JVM Marshall amps were prototypes for a signature amp that Marshall scheduled for release in 2011. They replaced the [[reverb]] with [[noise gate]]s that eliminate lag when switching channels. The clean channel was replaced by the clean channel of a 6100 LM model, which Satriani likes as an option to use [[distortion pedal]]s with. The orange [[od channel]] and the modern red overdrive channel have been better matched with each other as Satriani claims to prefer the organic overdrive of the JVM over pedals. The red overdrive channel was modified for a beefy rock rather than a [[nu metal]] sound. The effect loop has been simplified to be serial only.

Satriani has used many amps in the studio when recording, including the Peavey Classic. He used Marshall heads and cabinets, including live, prior to his Peavey endorsement. Recently Satriani used the JSX head through a Palmer Speaker Simulator. He has released a Class-A 5-watt tube amp called the "Mini Colossal". In 2009, Satriani split from Peavey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.vhnd.com/2009/06/23/the-genuinely-bizarre-case-of-the-satrianipeavey-endoresment-deals-collapse/ |title=The Genuinely Bizarre Case Of The Satriani/Peavey Endorsement Deal’s Collapse &amp;#124; Van Halen News Desk |publisher=Vhnd.com |date=2009-06-23 |accessdate=2015-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103712/http://www.vhnd.com/2009/06/23/the-genuinely-bizarre-case-of-the-satrianipeavey-endoresment-deals-collapse/ |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to using Marshall amps.

GuitarGeek.Com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring themes==
Satriani's work frequently makes references to various science fiction stories and ideas. "Surfing with the Alien," "Back to [[Shalla-Bal]]," and "The Power Cosmic 2000" refer to the comic book character [[Silver Surfer]], while "Ice 9" refers to the secret government ice weapon in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Cat's Cradle]]''. "Borg Sex" is a reference to ''[[Star Trek]]'', which features a [[wiktionary:Homogeneous|homogeneous]] [[cybernetic]] race known as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]]. His albums and songs often have other-worldly titles, such as ''[[Not of This Earth (Joe Satriani album)|Not of this Earth]]'', ''[[Crystal Planet]]'', ''[[Is There Love in Space?]]'', and ''[[Engines of Creation (Joe Satriani album)|Engines of Creation]]''.

On the album ''[[Super Colossal]]'', the song titled "Crowd Chant" was originally called "Party on the Enterprise". It would have featured [[sampling (music)|sampled]] sounds from the ''[[Starship Enterprise]]'' from ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. But as Satriani explained in a [[podcast]], legal issues regarding the samples could not be resolved, and he was unable to get permission to use them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/13_crowd_chant_podcast.mp3 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061034/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/13_crowd_chant_podcast.mp3 |date=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then removed the sounds from the song and called it "Crowd Chant". Its ending theme was inspired by composer [[Gabriel Fauré]]'s "[[Pavane (Fauré)|Pavane in F-sharp minor, Op. 50]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musoscribe.com/features/joe_satriani.shtml |title=Features and Interviews &gt; Guitarist Joe Satriani |publisher=Musoscribe.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113649/http://www.musoscribe.com/features/joe_satriani.shtml |archivedate=December 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is used as goal celebration music for a number of [[National Hockey League]] and [[Major League Soccer]] teams including the [[Minnesota Wild]] (NHL), [[New York Islanders]] (NHL), and [[New England Revolution]] (MLS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesotawild.com |title=Minnesota Wild Home |publisher=Minnesotawild.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030926210041/http://www.minnesotawild.com/ |archivedate=September 26, 2003 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is also used in the [[2K Sports]] hockey video game ''NHL 2k10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2ksports.com/beats/games/nhl2k10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119095513/http://2ksports.com/beats/games/nhl2k10 |archivedate=November 19, 2012 |title=2K Sports – 2K Beats : NHL 2K10 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Redshift Riders," another song on the ''[[Super Colossal]]'' album is, "...based on the idea that in the future, when people can travel throughout space, they will theoretically take advantage of the cosmological [[redshift]] effect so they can be swung around large planetary objects and get across [the] universe a lot faster than normal," Satriani said in a [[podcast]] about the song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/04_redshift_riders_podcast.mp3 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219061047/http://www.sonymusic.com/artists/JoeSatriani/podcast/super_colossal/04_redshift_riders_podcast.mp3 |date=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the album ''Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock'' the song "I Just Wanna Rock" is about a giant robot on the run who happens to stumble upon a rock concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://myplay.com/artists/joe-satriani/bio#review-form |title=Joe Satriani – Artist Bio &amp;#124; Myplay: Powered by Sony Music |publisher=Myplay |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301120932/http://myplay.com/artists/joe-satriani/bio#review-form |archivedate=March 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of the next general elections''' around the world in [[democracy|democratic]] polities. The [[general election]]s listed are for the government of each jurisdiction. These elections determine the [[Prime Minister]] and makeup of the [[legislature]] in a [[parliamentary democracy]], or the [[president]] and then the legislature in a [[Presidential system|system]] where separate votes are taken for different tiers of government.

In most jurisdictions, general elections are held between every three to five years,&lt;ref&gt;nb in Germany where there are elections every 4 years, the Federal Constitutional Court has held that five years is the limit that is compatible with living in a democratic society.&lt;/ref&gt; with presidential elections sometimes attaining 6 ([[Mexico]], [[Russia]] since a 2008 amendment) or 7 years ([[France]]'s [[septennat]] until 2000).

A country's [[constitution]] may give elections a fixed timing (i.e. [[United States]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]]), while some allow the government to dissolve [[Parliament]] and call a new vote up to a certain time limit ([[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]]). Some constitutions may require Parliaments to elect the Head of State under threat of dissolution ([[Greece]]). In most countries the election for the representative assembly determines the government.

All countries in [[the Americas]] which directly elect their [[President]], hold the Presidential and the legislative election at the same time. However, most countries in Europe split these elections and schedule them at different times.

International standards set a number of rules to judge whether the election is [[Unfair election|unfair]]. Some countries hold staged elections, but in most the election's outcome is the result of organized influence, as per [[social choice theory]]. [[Human rights]] violations include "compromise of the right to participate in government through free elections",&lt;ref&gt;[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] article 21&lt;/ref&gt; the right to [[freedom of association]],&lt;ref&gt;[[UDHR]] article 20&lt;/ref&gt; or the right to [[free expression]].&lt;ref&gt;[[UDHR]] article 19&lt;/ref&gt; Elections may also be unfair if unlawful [[political campaign financing]] favours particular interest groups, or if the law implicitly favors some through this means. Last but not least, media ownership may also create significant [[media bias]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OSCE]], ''[http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/68439?download=true Election Observation Handbook]'' (6th edn 2010) 18-22, 31, 37 and Annex A&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Democratic Institute]] also maintains a [https://www.ndi.org/elections-calendar?election_type=15 calendar of general elections].

'''Live Nation''' is an American [[Tour promoter|events promoter]] and venue operator based in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Formed in 1996 by [[Robert F. X. Sillerman]] as '''SFX Entertainment''', the company's business was built around consolidating concert promoters into a national company. In 2000, the company was sold to [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]] for $4.4 billion, and operated as '''Clear Channel Entertainment''' until 2005, when it was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] as Live Nation.

In 2010, Live Nation merged with the [[Primary ticket outlet|ticketing]] company [[Ticketmaster]], forming the larger conglomerate [[Live Nation Entertainment]].

In 2017, Live Nation reported $30 billion in gross transaction value from primary and secondary ticketing. Live Nation Entertainment produces over 29,500 events in 40 countries each year. In 2017, Live Nation hosted over 86 million on-site consumers at its events and also invested $5.6 billion to put on its events that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investors.livenationentertainment.com/news-center/news-center-details/2018/Live-Nation-Entertainment-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-And-Full-Year-2017-Results/default.aspx Live Nation Entertainment Reports Fourth Quarter And Full Year 2017 Results]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In February 2009, Live Nation announced that it had reached an agreement to merge with the ticket broker [[Ticketmaster]] in a $2.5 billion, all-stock deal. The merger was consumnated in early 2010, with both companies becoming divisions of the new parent company [[Live Nation Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/10/ticketmaster-and-live-nation-conduct-25-billion-merger-create-live-nation-entertainment/|title=TicketMaster and Live Nation Agree to $2.5 Billion Merger|last=Hendrickson|first=Mark|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/business/25ticket.html|title=Ticketmaster Joins Live Nation, and an Industry Quakes|last=Segal|first=David|date=2010-04-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, [[Insomniac Events]], a promoter focused on [[electronic dance music]], announced a major "creative partnership" with Live Nation, giving the promoter access to Live Nation's resources while remaining an independent company.

==Live Nation International Music and Live Nation Artists==
Live Nation is currently constructing a physical recording label,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Live Nation Artists, which will be a division of Live Nation International Music. The company is expected to become a major rival against [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], [[Universal Music Group]] and [[Warner Music Group]] with artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[U2]], [[Shakira]], [[Jay-Z]] and [[Nickelback]].

As of July 30, 2008, CEO Michael Rapino is considering doing licensing deals on an artist-by-artist basis, a source inside Live Nation said. Under that scenario, [[Warner Music Group]] could end up handling the marketing, promotion, and distribution of albums by the very acts that defected from it to join Live Nation: Nickelback and Madonna. "Rapino wants to outsource everything," said a second source close to the situation. "He doesn't want to build an infrastructure or carry any overhead." The move is mirrored after the "rent-a-system" model used in Hollywood, whereby one studio produces a movie but licenses all the other functions to another studio that already has a distribution and marketing infrastructure.&lt;ref name="nypost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07302008/business/a_different_tune_122233.htm | work=New York Post | title=A Different Tune | first1=Brian | last1=Garrity | first2=Peter | last2=Lauria | date=July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Live Nation's talks represented the latest retrenchment from the strategy of former chairman [[Michael Cohl]], who sought to transform the touring giant into a multi-faceted powerhouse, including a record company. News of the potential outsourcing move followed the dismissal of industry veterans Bob Ezrin, Bob Cahill and Bill Hein, all of whom were Artist Nation employees hired by Cohl to create a label infrastructure for Live Nation's newly signed acts. Instead of banking all the upside on album sales, as was once envisioned with these so-called "360 deals," Live Nation would likely collect a less lucrative outsourcing royalty of between 25 percent and 35 percent, based on other industry licensing deals.
It would then be responsible for using that money to pay the artist's royalty - a fee that, at the superstar level, can come close to equaling the licensing royalty the company is apt to get from a label.&lt;ref name="nypost.com"/&gt;

On 31 March 2008, it was confirmed that Live Nation signed a 12-year deal with U2 worth an estimated $100 million (£70 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/2787228/U2-ties-the-knot-with-Live-Nation-deal.html|title=U2 ties the knot with Live Nation deal|first=Emma|last=Thelwell|date=31 March 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal includes Live Nation controlling the band's merchandise, sponsoring and their official website. In a contractual agreement with Live Nation signed in March 2008, the parties agreed that the band would receive $25 million for 1.6 million shares of the company; as of 17 December 2008, those shares were worth only just over $6 million. It was reported on 18 December 2008 that Live Nation, honoring their financial commitment, bought back the shares at a loss of $19 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATE 1-Live Nation takes $19 mln hit on U2 buyback deal|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUKBNG16028420081218 | work=Reuters | first=Ajay | last=Kamalakaran | date=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had intended to recoup the cost of signing U2 with their most recent album, ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. ''No Line on the Horizon'' achieved a multi-platinum status in the international market and has sold over 5 million albums to date.

==Proposed merger==
On February 10, 2009, Live Nation and [[Ticketmaster|Ticketmaster Entertainment]] announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to create a combined entity, to be called [[Live Nation Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-3373589"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstar.com/news_article.aspx?ID=647940 |title=Live Nation, Ticketmaster Announce Merger |work=pollstar.com |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=April 9, 2014 |author= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409090434/http://www.pollstar.com/news_article.aspx?ID=647940 |archivedate=April 9, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ticketmaster's press release said Live Nation produces live concerts in 57 countries.&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-3373589"/&gt;

The proposal has received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey.&lt;ref name=competitioncomission&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/TICK/0x0x340322/ff220710-6ab4-4baf-b088-1b61758f4eea/TKTM_News_2009_12_22_General_News_Releases.pdf |title=MEDIA STATEMENT: Ticketmaster and Live Nation Welcome Competition Commission Ruling on Merger |work=files.shareholder.com |date=April 9, 2014 |accessdate=April 9, 2014 |author= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409091622/http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/TICK/0x0x340322/ff220710-6ab4-4baf-b088-1b61758f4eea/TKTM_News_2009_12_22_General_News_Releases.pdf |archivedate=April 9, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the United Kingdom's [[Competition Commission]] provisionally ruled against the merger with Ticketmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Van Buskirk, Eliot|title=Live Nation/Ticketmaster Merger Faces Obstacles Here and Abroad|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/10/live-nationticketmaster-merger-faces-obstacles-here-and-abroad/|date=October 12, 2009|publisher=Condé Nast|work=Wired|accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 22, 2009, the Competition Commission decided to clear the proposed merger.&lt;ref name=competitioncomission/&gt;

Separate regulatory reviews of the proposal continued in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=competitioncomission/&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice]] approved the merger in 2010 subject to review by a federal judge after a 60-day comment period.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski&gt;{{cite news|title=Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger gets Justice Department's approval|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-ticketmaster26-2010jan26,0,5237319,full.story|date=January 26, 2010|author=Chmielewski, Dawn C. and Fritz, Ben and Lewis, Randy|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A condition of the approval, Ticketmaster agreed to license its software to rival [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]], and to sell its subsidiary Paciolan to [[Comcast Spectacor]], Comcast's sporting events subsidiary.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski /&gt; The company also agreed not to interfere with competition for the ten-year life of the agreement.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski /&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2009, in reaction to a merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster, [[Bruce Springsteen]] said "the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bruce Springsteen "Furious" At Ticketmaster, Rails Against Live Nation Merger|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/02/04/bruce-springsteen-furious-at-ticketmaster-rails-against-live-nation-merger/|date=February 4, 2009|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 25, 2010 press release, the TicketDisaster.org group—a coalition of consumer rights and anti-trust groups—also issued the following statement about the proposed Live Nation-TicketMaster merger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Despite its "monopoly-like dominance" controlling 70 to 80 percent of all concert ticket sales, Ticketmaster is unabashedly seeking to grow its empire - all to the detriment of the average fan. Ticketmaster is now trying to dampen competition by merging with Live Nation, the nation's largest concert promoter and second largest primary ticket seller. That merger is coming under heavy fire from consumer and industry groups and Members of Congress, particularly because of the clear anti-consumer and anti-competitive effects. As the Department of Justice reaches the final round of reviewing this merger, only one question must be answered: will the merger lead to increased prices, poorer service, or less innovation?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story''''' is a 16-page comic book about [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Rosa Parks]], and the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] published in 1957 by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States)|Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (FOR USA). It advocates the principles of [[nonviolence]] and provides a primer on [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref name=PW&gt;Bello. Grace. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/authors/profiles/article/58354-a-comic-book-for-social-justice-john-lewis.html "A Comic Book for Social Justice: John Lewis,"] ''Publishers Weekly'' (July 19, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ignored by the mainstream comics industry, ''The Montgomery Story'' was widely distributed among civil rights groups, churches, and schools. It helped inspire nonviolent protest movements around the [[Southern United States]], and later in [[Latin America]], [[South Africa]],&lt;ref name=Aydin /&gt; the [[Middle East]], and elsewhere. Over 50 years after its initial publication, the comic inspired the best-selling, award-winning [[March (comics)|''March'' trilogy]] by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Congressman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]].&lt;ref name=PW /&gt;

== Publication history ==
Following the success of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which FOR USA had helped organize, executive secretary and director of publications&lt;ref name=Aydin /&gt; [[Alfred Hassler]],&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;Forest, Jim (former FoR Publication Director). Comment on Ethan Persoff's blog (2011): "The author of the text and the man who had the idea for the comic was Al Hassler, executive secretary of FOR USA. He convinced comic artist Al Capp of the value of the project. Capp's studio did the drawings gratis."&lt;/ref&gt; and FoR member the Rev. [[Glenn E. Smiley]] came up with the idea of using a comic book to bring the story of the bus boycott to a wide audience. (Smiley had been personally active in the bus boycott, and had formed a friendship with Dr. King.)&lt;ref name=Aydin&gt;Aydin, Andrew. [http://clatl.com/atlanta/the-comic-book-that-changed-the-world/Content?oid=8807186&amp;showFullText=true "The comic book that changed the world: Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story's vital role in the Civil Rights Movement,"] ''Creative Loafing'' (Aug. 1, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Presenting the comic idea as a way to reach wider audiences (including those with lower reading levels),&lt;ref name=Aydin /&gt; the group acquired grant funding of $5,000 for the project&lt;ref name=Grio&gt;Love, David A.

Cartoonist [[Al Capp]] was an admirer of Dr. King; his studio produced ''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story'' at no charge,&lt;ref name=Forest /&gt; which was co-written by Hassler and [[Benton Resnik]], and drawn by an uncredited artist.&lt;ref name=Previews /&gt; (Benton Resnick had been an editor and writer for the Al Capp-owned comics companies [[Toby Press]] and Graphic Information Services.)&lt;ref name=Aydin /&gt;  The artist has since been confirmed to be [[Sy Barry]]&lt;ref name="beat"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/big-apple-con-report-finally-revealed-the-artist-of-the-martin-luther-king-jr-comic/|title=Big Apple Con report—finally revealed: the artist of the Martin Luther King Jr. comic|date=2018-04-16|work=The Beat|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; by artist [[James Romberger]]. It was published in December [[1957 in comics|1957]] in full-color with a cover price of 10 cents. 250,000 copies were printed.&lt;ref name=Grio /&gt;

Instead of the typical distribution network for comics in those days, which were [[newsstands]], [[pharmacies]], and [[candy store]]s, ''The Montgomery Story'' was distributed by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States)|Fellowship of Reconciliation]]&lt;ref&gt;Karlin, Susan.

It was also promoted in pro-Civil Rights publications such as ''[[National Guardian]]'' and ''[[Peace News]]''.&lt;ref name=Aydin /&gt; FoR staff members, particularly Jim Lawson (an African American divinity student at [[Vanderbilt University]])&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, John, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell. ''March: Book One'' (Top Shelf Productions, 2013), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; and Glenn Smiley, traveled through the South, giving workshops on nonviolence. They would distribute the comic to younger attendees as something to take with them and study.&lt;ref name=Previews /&gt; Some [[African Americans]] memorized and destroyed the comic to avoid being [[lynched]] for having it in their possession.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

At some point not long after its original publication, FoR produced a Spanish version of the comic for distribution throughout [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=Aydin /&gt; Instead of using the same art as the English edition, the Spanish version is a complete copy of the original, drawn by a different artist.&lt;ref name=Aydin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Persoff06 /&gt; 125,000 copies were printed, but only a handful of copies of the Spanish version still exist.&lt;ref name=Persoff06 /&gt;

=== Revival ===

In 2004 comic book artist, writer and historian Tom Christopher researched the King comic and posted the article, which included art samples of both the English and Spanish versions, on his website. Christopher had previously documented the publication of ''[[All-Negro Comics]]'' (1947) and the ''Golden Legacy'' and ''Fast Willie Jackson'' series (1976), and those articles included information on other comics such as ''Negro Heroes'' and ''[[Negro Romance]]''. Christopher described ''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story'' not in terms of being a rare or obscure comic but as an historic document, placing it in the political context of the times and explaining non-violence as a workable tool for social change. ''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story'' became a major attraction on his website, and the next ''[[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]'' listed the book for the first time.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

By 2006, there were only a handful of copies of ''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story'' left in existence.&lt;ref name=Grio /&gt;&lt;ref name=Persoff11 /&gt; That year, cartoonist/archivist [[Ethan Persoff]] scanned an original copy of the comic and posted it on his blog for [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]].&lt;ref name=Persoff06&gt;Persoff, Ethan. [http://www.ep.tc/mlk/ "The 1956 International Bilingual Dr Martin Luther King Jr Comic Book Message,"] Ethan Persoff's blog (early January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Persoff reported that the Cairo director of the [[American Islamic Congress]] (AIC) had translated the scanned comic into [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. The AIC's HAMSA (Hands Across the Mideast Support Alliance) initiative printed 2,500 copies of the translated comic, distributing them throughout [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name=Grio /&gt;&lt;ref name=Persoff08&gt;Persoff, Ethan. [http://www.ep.tc/intro-archive021.html#hamsa "HOW EP.TC IS UNINTENTIONALLY CONTRIBUTING TO WORLD PEACE,"] Ethan Persoff's blog (March 27, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2012, no history of ''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story'' had been written, and most versions of how the comic was created listed Al Capp as the actual creator. As part of his graduate degree at Georgetown University, [[Andrew Aydin]] wrote the first long-form history of ''The Montgomery Story'' as his graduate thesis. With the help of [[Carlow University]] Professor Dr. Sylvia Rhor and comic book icon [[Eddie Campbell]], Aydin established most of what is known about the comic's creation and use. In August 2013, Aydin published a shortened version of his thesis as the feature article in ''[[Creative Loafing]]'''s award-winning "Future of Nonviolence" issue, which was guest-edited by Congressman John Lewis and Aydin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aydin|first1=Andrew|title=The comic book that changed the world|url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/the-comic-book-that-changed-the-world/Content?oid=8807186|date=August 1, 2013|website=Creative Loafing|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Michaud|first1=Debbie|last2=Williams|first2=Wyatt|title=Congressman John Lewis takes over Creative Loafing|url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/congressman-john-lewis-takes-over-creative-loafing/Content?oid=8828401|date=August 1, 2013|website=Creative Loafing|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Top Shelf Productions]] published an authorized re-issue of the comic, with all proceeds going to the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States)|Fellowship of Reconciliation]].&lt;ref name=Previews /&gt;

== Plot ==
The comic opens with a one-page synopsis of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s life and education up until 1957.

The narrative then shifts to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], in 1954. An [[African American]] man named Jones tells of life in Montgomery under [[Jim Crow laws]]. He describes the events of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] and the important role played by [[Rosa Parks]] and Martin Luther King, Jr. In the story, King advocates nonviolence, even when his own home is bombed during the boycott.

The last section of the comic discusses the "Montgomery Method" of [[nonviolence]], its roots in the activism of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and provides practical advice on how to pursue nonviolent activism.

== Legacy ==
''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story'' influenced other civil rights activists, including the [[Greensboro Four]].&lt;ref name=Aydin /&gt;&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance /&gt;

Thanks to the 2008 [[American Islamic Congress]] HAMSA initiative, thousands of copies of the Arabic and Persian version of the comic were distributed to democracy advocates throughout the Middle East. When the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]] broke out, U.S. Representative [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] credited the mass-distribution of the 50-year-old comic as a contributing element in the Egyptian protests.&lt;ref name=Persoff11&gt;Persoff, Ethan. [http://www.ep.tc/intro-archive070.html#mlk "OUR WEBSITE'S WORK USED IN WIDE-SPREAD EGYPTIAN PEACE CAMPAIGN"] Ethan Persoff blog (February 3–15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Persoff08 /&gt;

A [[hard copy]] of the Spanish edition of the comic is housed in the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]], part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name=Persoff11 /&gt;

=== ''March'' ===
[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Congressman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] read ''Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story'' as a teenager. The comic book demonstrated in clear fashion to Lewis the power of the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence. Later, as he attended weekly meetings with students from [[Fisk University]], [[Tennessee State University]], [[Vanderbilt University]], and [[American Baptist College]] to discuss nonviolent protest, ''The Montgomery Story'' served as one of their guides.&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance&gt;Hughes, Joseph (September 16, 2013). [http://comicsalliance.com/congressman-john-lewis-interview-march-andrew-aydin-top-shelf/ "Congressman John Lewis And Andrew Aydin Talk Inspiring The ‘Children Of The Movement’ With ‘March’ (Interview)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918055700/http://comicsalliance.com/congressman-john-lewis-interview-march-andrew-aydin-top-shelf/ |date=2013-09-18 }}. [[Comics Alliance]].&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis went on to become an important activist during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

While working on his [[United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2008|2008 reelection campaign]], Lewis told his telecommunications and technology policy aide, [[Andrew Aydin]], about ''The Montgomery Story'' and its influence.&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance/&gt; Aydin tracked down a copy of the comic (which had long since fallen out of print), and thought that Lewis' own story would make strong material for comic book treatment:

{{quote|Once he told me about it, and I connected those dots that a comic book had a meaningful impact on the early days of the Civil Rights Movement, and in particular on young people, it just seemed self-evident. If it had happened before, why couldn't it happen again?&lt;ref name=ComicsAlliance/&gt;}}

Aydin repeatedly suggested that Lewis himself write a comic book, and eventually Lewis decided to commit to the project, on the condition that Aydin write it with him.&lt;ref name=VAJQA&gt;Herbowy, Greg (Fall 2014).

'''Marilee Lee Bruszer''',&lt;ref name=doeMP/&gt;&lt;ref name=namusMP/&gt; previously known as '''Juab County Jane Doe''', was a formerly unidentified [[Americans|American]] murder victim who was found on September 3, 1978. Bruszer's body was not identified for 37 years (until August 2015) due to an inaccurate physical description generated by the original investigators and the great distance she was found from where she had resided prior to her disappearance.

==Circumstances==

[[File:Juab Yuba Lake Jane Doe Reconstruction 007.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Reconstruction of the Juab County Jane Doe]]
Bruszer went missing on August 22, 1978 from [[Long Beach, California]]. Few details were available about her case, although authorities did believe she had been murdered and classified her as "endangered missing." Further into the investigation, her dental records and DNA information were obtained to compare against unidentified bodies in the country.&lt;ref name=doeMP&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 1176DFCA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/1176dfca.html|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=namusMP&gt;{{cite web|title=Marilee Bruszer|url=https://www.findthemissing.org/cases/9493/211|website=findthemissing.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 1978, the naked remains of a woman were found near the Yuba Lake campground in [[Juab County, Utah]] by three women who were fishing near the Yuba Dam.&lt;ref name=victim&gt;{{cite news|title=Victim of Strangler|work=The Times News|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was white and believed to have been five feet two to three inches ({{convert|62|to|63|in|cm|0|disp=out}}) tall at a weight around {{convert|110|lb}}, which was reported to be inconsistent with Bruszer's height and weight at {{convert|5|ft|5|in|cm|spell=in}} and {{convert|145|to|150|lb}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=namusMP/&gt; The victim was said to have light blond hair that was {{convert|11|in|cm|spell=in}} long, although some sources state that it was brown, strawberry blond or sandy blond. Her natural hair color was likely light brown, as some pubic hair was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utah's Unidentified Persons|url=http://publicsafety.utah.gov/bci/UTAHunidentifiedpersons.html|website=publicsafety.utah.gov|publisher=Utah Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=September 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831183108/http://publicsafety.utah.gov/bci/UTAHunidentifiedpersons.html|archive-date=2014-08-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the body, a double-hooped earring was found along with a white barrette. She had some dental crowding, which caused one of her front teeth to be crooked.&lt;ref name=unk/&gt; The woman was believed to be between eighteen and twenty-two when she was strangled several months to three years before her body was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 751UFUT|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/751ufut.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 8382|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/8382|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=September 16, 2014|date=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age and time of death of the victim are now known to have been inaccurate, as Bruszer was thirty-three at the time she disappeared a month before the remains were found.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNAhit/&gt;

==Identification==
Early into the investigation, it was speculated that the victim was one of four missing women from the area, Nancy Wilcox, Susan Curtis, Debra Kent and Nancy Baird. Later, these were eventually eliminated as potential identities after [[x-ray]]s of Juab County Jane Doe's teeth were compared to their dental records.&lt;ref name=victim/&gt;&lt;ref name=unk&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl's Identity Remains Unknown|work=The Times News|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State Seeks Help in Identifying Girl|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19780908&amp;id=diVVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-X8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6096,1853286|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=The Deseret News|date=8 September 1978|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, all four subjects still remain missing and have never been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Susan Curtis|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/c/curtis_susan.html|website=The Charley Project|date=12 December 2014|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nancy Wilcox|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/w/wilcox_nancy.html|website=The Charley Project|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debra Jean Kent|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/k/kent_debra.html|website=The Charley Project|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nancy Perry Baird|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/b/baird_nancy.html|website=The Charley Project|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A detective was looking through the evidence locker at the [[Davis County Sheriff's Office (Utah)|Davis County Sheriff's Office]] in 2013 when he came across some hair marked "Hair from Yuba Lake body." This was attributed to retired Davis County Sheriff's Captain Kenny Payne formerly working there as well as the state medical examiner's office at the same time and misplacing the evidence. The detective sent it off to Juab County soon after.&lt;ref name=DNAhit&gt;{{cite web|title=2 cold case victims identified in Juab Co. thanks to DNA|url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=36762352&amp;nid=148|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=September 16, 2014|date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Juab County Sheriff's Office]] secured a sample of this evidence and had it sent to Texas for testing in 2014. There, a DNA profile was generated and entered into the national database of missing people resulting in a familial match with two of Bruszer's family members who had submitted their DNA in the hopes of locating her. On August 22, 2015, the Long Beach Police informed the relatives that Bruszer had formally been identified.&lt;ref name=DNAhit/&gt;

'''Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne''' (English: The '''Irish Dancing World Championships'''; often simply '''the Worlds''') is an annual [[Irish stepdance]] competition run by [[An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha]] (the Irish Dancing Commission). The Worlds include competitions for solo stepdance, organised by gender and age; and for certain traditional and original [[ceili dance]]s, also divided by age group and team gender composition.&lt;ref name="Rainey2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rainey|first1=Sarah|title=My idea of hell? 5,000 Irish dancers&amp;nbsp;– and me|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10768856/My-idea-of-hell-5000-Irish-dancers-and-me.html|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne is the top competition of the hierarchical system operated by An Coimisiún, and dancers must qualify at major Irish stepdance events across the world in order to compete.

The first Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne was run in 1970, and the event is now one of six [[oireachtas (Irish dance)|oireachtais]] (championship competitions) under different organisations to be called the World Championships.&lt;ref name="Egan2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Egan|first1=John|title=So many Irish Dancing World Championships|url=http://www.theirishworld.com/john-egan-many-world-championships/|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=The Irish World|date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, sometimes called the "[[Olympics]] of Irish dance", is the largest, attracting some 5,000 competitors and 25,000 spectators each year from over 30 countries.&lt;ref name="IrishTimes2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Kathleen|title=Jigs, reels and slips at the 'Olympics of Irish dance'|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/jigs-reels-and-slips-at-the-olympics-of-irish-dance-1.3048650|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=The Irish Times|date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Figaro 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bavalier|first1=Ariane|title=Entrez dans la danse irlandaise|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2011/11/24/03002-20111124ARTFIG00763-entrez-dans-la-danse-irlandaise.php|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Le Figaro|date=24 November 2011|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The next largest, run by An Comhdháil Na Múinteoirí Le Rincí Gaelacha, involves about 1,700 competitors.{{refn|name=IT Comhdháil 2013|{{cite news|last1=McGreevy|first1=Ronan|title=World Irish dance championships kicks off in Dublin|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world-irish-dance-championships-kicks-off-in-dublin-1.1338611|accessdate=29 September 2017|work=The Irish Times|date=26 March 2013}} }} }} It has played a role in the [[Globalization|globalisation]] of Irish stepdance and Irish dance generally, and, since the beginning of the 21st century, has been held in locations across the [[British Isles]] and in [[North America]].

The Worlds traditionally run across [[Holy Week]],{{efn|Although sources describe the competition as taking place in [[Easter Week]],{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=184}} the last day of the Championships is usually [[Easter Sunday]], meaning that it occurs in the week more usually known as Holy Week in Christian traditions.}} and have at times extended to various cultural events outside of dancing. The development of the Championships formed a significant part of the [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] agenda of An Coimisiún and the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] towards the end of the 20th century.

== History ==
{{see also|An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha#History}}

=== Origins (1927–1969) ===
An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha was established between 1927 and 1930 by the [[Gaelic League]], which had for some years beforehand been consolidating control over Irish dancing as a means of promoting the [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] movement. An Coimisiún's original stated objectives, laid down at the Congress of the Gaelic League in 1931, were to "protect and promote Irish dancing" and to "direct and control all Irish Dancing competitions throughout Ireland".&lt;ref name="Cullinane2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cullinane|first1=John|title=An Coimisiun le Rinci Gaelacha: Its Origins and Evolution|date=2003|publisher=John P. Cullinane|isbn=0952795248|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the earliest events developed by the new organisation was Oireachtas Rince na hÉireann (the All-Ireland Championships), which was first established as an independent event in 1929. It had previously been a component of the Gaelic League's annual Oireachtas cultural festival.&lt;ref name="Cullinane2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cullinane|first1=John|title=Further aspects of the history of Irish dancing in Ireland, Scotland, Canada, America, New Zealand and Australia|date=2001|publisher=John Cullinane|isbn=0952795256|page=47|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second major event, the Great Britain Championships, developed in the 1950s to meet increasing demand for Irish stepdance competitions in [[London]] and surrounds.&lt;ref name="Cullinane2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cullinane|first1=John|title=Aspects of the History of Irish Dancing in London 1880–2014|date=2014|publisher=John Cullinane|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gradual transition of An Coimisiún from local to international governing body began in the early 1950s.{{sfn|Whelan|2000|p=44}} With the advent of affordable [[air travel]] and improved communication links from the 1960s onward, increased contact with dancing teachers across the [[Irish diaspora]] led An Coimisiún to gradually become a global organisation. This transition included the first examinations for teachers and adjudicators to be held in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]].{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=13}} The concept of a World Championships event was first discussed in 1967.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=23}} In early 1968, An Coimisiún established Provincial Championships in [[Leinster]], [[Munster]] and [[Connacht]], complementing the existing championships in [[Ulster]], as part of a scheme which envisaged both the All-Ireland and Great Britain Championships becoming open only to dancers living in Ireland and Great Britain respectively.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=24}} This change, which mirrored a similar system being developed in Australia at the time, was hoped to eventually lead to dancers qualifying first for their national championships and then for a newly created World Championships.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=23}}

At the same time, [[An Comhdháil na Múinteoirí le Rincí Gaelacha]] (the Congress of Irish Dance Teachers), a [[Dublin]]-based organisation with whom many of An Coimisiún's teachers had been associated since the early 1960s, began to increase its influence.{{snf|Cullinane|2016|p=15}} This caused tensions within An Coimisiún, particularly because of a perceived over-representation of delegates from the Gaelic League.&lt;ref name="Hall2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Frank|title=Competitive Irish dance : art, sport, duty|date=2008|publisher=Macater Press|isbn=9780981492421|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/?id=90_aAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=irish+dancing+split&amp;q=split|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1969, teachers were compelled to register with one organisation or the other, which led to many of An Coimisiún's registered teachers within Ireland leaving the organisation.{{snf|Cullinane|2016|p=15}} This event, which would become known as "the split", eventually resulted in An Comhdháil establishing itself as an alternative governing body for Irish dance with its own system of registration, examinations and competition.&lt;ref name="Egan2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Egan|first1=John|title=Who Runs the Global Dance World?|url=http://www.irishdancing.com/images/pdf/Who%20Runs%20the%20Global%20Dance%20World-IDM10-16.pdf|website=Irish Dancing Magazine|accessdate=21 September 2017|page=2|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of nearly half of An Coimisiún's teachers seriously jeopardised its planned World Championships, but a majority of overseas teachers continued to support the event, and this enabled preparations to continue.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=17}}

One long-term impact of the split prior to the first Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne was the eventual establishment of competing World Championship events. An Comhdháil increased its reach into the early 21st century, and in 2012 renamed its All-Ireland Championships the World Championships in order to compete with Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne.&lt;ref name="IrishTimes2017" /&gt; Further ructions within An Comhdhail had also resulted in the establishment of several other Irish dancing regulatory bodies, many of which themselves expanded into international markets. By 2017, Cumann Rince Dea Mheasa, the [[World Irish Dance Association]], Cumann Rince Náisiúnta and Cumann Rince Gaelach were each hosting World Championship events, with varying levels of international participation.&lt;ref name="Egan2017" /&gt; Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne remains the largest of the six events.&lt;ref name="Figaro 2011" /&gt;

The first Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne was eventually held in the Coláiste Mhuire Auditorium in [[Parnell Square]], Dublin, on 1–3 May 1970, with five solo championships for men (by age group), five for women, three ceili championships and two "figure dance" championships.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=32–34}} This event also included a number of "subsidiary" competitions not considered part of the Championships themselves; these were discontinued after the first year due to the popularity of the main event.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=34}} The establishment of this event has been described as the most significant development in Irish stepdance during the history of An Coimisiún.&lt;ref name="O'Neil 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Neil|first1=Gerard F.|title=Pittsburgh Irish: Erin on the Three Rivers|date=2015|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625853882|page=143|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=CpdoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represented a fulfilment of An Coimisiún's goal to unite the [[Irish diaspora]] under a single, homogenous identity.&lt;ref name="Foley 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foley|first=Catherine|date=2001|title=Perceptions of Irish Step Dance: National, Global, and Local|journal=Dance Research Journal|volume=33|issue=1|pages=34–45|doi=10.2307/1478855|jstor=1478855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Championships were judged by a single panel of three adjudicators, who awarded only three placings in each event. Over the following years, the number of judges was increased and separate panels introduced in an effort to improve the quality of adjudication.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=98}}

The early years of Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne saw little success from competitors outside Ireland, despite the presence of a large contingent of North American dancers. This was due to a number of factors including the overseas competitors' style of dance, which was viewed as by the Irish as outdated, and differences in competition protocol between North America and Ireland.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=76–85}} However, [[Michael Flatley]], who became the first North American winner of the World Championships in 1975, recalled that his attempt to win at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne focused on adopting a more rigid and conservative dance style that would be accepted by Irish adjudicators. Flatley had competed at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne for the first time the year prior, and had placed fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flatley|first1=Michael|title=Lord of the Dance: My Story|date=2006|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743291798|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKrYMIgVmNoC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of competing successfully in Ireland was known to North American dancers as the "Emerald Barrier", and contributed to the development of an extensive system of competitions and championships on the North American continent.{{sfn|Venable|2001|p=284}} In 1971, the Irish Dancing Teachers' Association of North America chartered a [[Boeing 747]] in an attempt to increase the number of North American competitors. In 1972, two entire [[Boeing 707]]s from [[Aer Lingus]] were booked to transport the North American contingent.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=76–77}} 

American teams experienced many of the same difficulties as solo dancers in succeeding during the early years of Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, although in some cases, the differences were more explicitly political. A North American dance drama team which had previously met with some success was placed last in the 1986 competition. Although the official reason for the decision was the inclusion of non-Irish music in the choreography, the team's teacher alleged to American media that the adjudicators had resented the dance's commentary on the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="Chicago Mar 1987"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cross |first1=Robert |title=When Irish Lassies Go Dancing, Their Mentor Is Betting They'll Steal The World Championship Away |work=Chicago Tribune |date=17 March 1987 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conor Hayes became the first Australian to win a World Championship as late as 1996,{{sfn|Whelan|2000|p=22}} and the inferiority of overseas competitors in the perception of adjudicators and Irish participants persisted into the early 21st century.{{sfn|Wulff|2007|p=100}}

Even within Ireland, the Worlds were initially dominated by dance schools from Ulster, whose style had become well-known via television broadcasts in the late 1969s. However, following the commencement of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland in 1969, the competitive Irish dancing structure in the region rapidly disintegrated, and with it, the success of Ulster dancers.{{sfn|Whelan|2000|p=19}}

From 1975 onwards, the national championships of Australia, North America, Ireland and Great Britain, which had until that point served as qualifying events for the Worlds, were supplemented by regional championships in each country&amp;nbsp;– North America, for instance, was divided into seven regions, to increase the number of world qualifiers. The system of regional and national championships serving as qualifying events was eventually expanded globally.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=94–95}}

Following complaints about the requirement that dancers qualify for the Championships, An Coimisiún decided to open the 1984 Worlds in [[Cork City]] to all dancers, with no qualification required. The subsequent massive influx of dancers necessitated the use of four separate venues in Cork over the course of 8 days, at the time the largest Irish dance event ever conducted. The large number of dancers in each section necessitated an extension to the usual three rounds of competition so that adjudicators had the opportunity to properly rank dancers. It was decided that due to the logistical complexities of such a large event, qualification would be reinstated for 1985.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=65–96}}

The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the gradual introduction of [[metronome]]s to regulate the [[tempo]] of accompanying music, as well as the introduction of a set number of bars for each dance.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=102–103}} The length of each performance had previously been at the discretion of the judging panel, which had resulted in unfair disadvantage to competitors forced to dance for longer.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=103–104}} The 1986 Worlds, held in [[Limerick]], were the first to use [[computer]] technology for the tabulation of results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|url=http://www.rte.ie/archives/2016/0324/777233-world-irish-dancing-championships/|title=Irish Dancing in Limerick|date=28 March 1986|last=Walsh|first=Michael|type=Televsion broadcast|language=en|publisher=RTÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Riverdance era (1994–present) ===
The success of the ''[[Riverdance]]'' show after its debut at the interval of the [[1994 Eurovision Song Contest]] drastically transformed Irish dance in its style, popularity, and relationship to traditional Irish arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Masero|first=Angelika|title=The Changes in Irish Dance Since Riverdance|date=2010|degree=Honors College Capstone|publisher=Western Kentucky University|url=http://digitalcommons.wku.edu/stu_hon_theses/234|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the two-year timeframe of the first ''Riverdance'' the number of competitors at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne increased by 25%. This followed a period of approximately five years where participation numbers had remained roughly constant. The increase in competitor numbers was largely concentrated in younger age groups and led to the first Worlds sections with more than 100 competing dancers.&lt;ref name="Steffan2014"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Steffan|first=Olivia|title=This Is How We Dance: The Impact of Riverdance on Irish Step Dancing|date=2014|degree=Masters|publisher=Drexel University|url=https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6199/datastream/OBJ/download/This_Is_How_We_Dance__The_Impact_of_Riverdance_on_Irish_Step_Dancing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase in numbers was confined largely to female dancers, and the decades following ''Riverdance'' saw a decline in the number of male dancers and mixed-gender ceili teams.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=120–121}}

1994 also marked the 25th edition of Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne. A commemorative video was produced by An Coimisiún and made available for purchase after the Championships. This was among the first Irish stepdance competitions for which An Coimisiún granted permission for filming.{{sfn|Venable|2008|p=215}}

In 2000, [[Belfast]] was announced as the location for the first Worlds to be held outside the Republic of Ireland. At the time, some competitors expressed fears for their safety in the new location, but Belfast authorities were keen to ensure the event's success to improve the city's reputation as a [[tourist destination]].&lt;ref name="Hill2000"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Ian|title=Arts: Irish dancing Olympics in Belfast|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/324587218/984EE2230AE44ADBPQ/1|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=The Belfast News Letter|date=15 March 2000|via=ProQuest Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 Championships, planned to be held in [[Ennis]], were cancelled due to the outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in Great Britain, from where nearly 35% of that year's competitors were expected to travel. The first Worlds to be cancelled caused substantially increased demand for the North American National Championships, traditionally held at the end of July, and forced organisers of that event to add stage capacity to cope with the influx of dancers.&lt;ref name="Carr2001"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carr|first1=Darrah|title=Foot and Mouth Disease Cancels Irish Dance Championships|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/FOOT+AND+MOUTH+DISEASE+CANCELS+IRISH+DANCE+CHAMPIONSHIPS.-a075753724|accessdate=21 September 2017|work=Dance Magazine|date=1 July 2001|via=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as a result of qualifiers for the 2001 event being allowed to carry over their qualification status to 2002, the next year in Glasgow saw a one-third increase on the usual number of competitors.&lt;ref name="Scotland 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Darrah|title=Step Dancers Take Scotland By Storm|journal=Dance Magazine|date=July 2002|volume=76|issue=7|page=14|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f6h&amp;AN=7010857&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, An Coimisiún launched a now-defunct official website for Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne at worldirishdancing.com. This website provided information on results and daily photographic commentary during the Championships.{{sfn|Venable|2008|p=219}}

The Worlds were held three times in North America in the early 21st century: Philadelphia in 2009, Boston in 2013 and Montreal in 2015. Although the number of competitors was higher than ever before due to the large number of dancers in the region, many dancers from Ireland and the UK did not attend, which led to a significant drop in the number of team entries.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=129–131}} In 2009, to celebrate the 40th Championships, and in recognition of the increasingly global nature of the Worlds, a replica of the championship trophies was cast with the name of each host city inscribed on its base. This trophy is held by the host city for the year in which it holds Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=137}}

At a meeting of An Coimisiún on 20–21 January 2018, a new "double recall" system was approved for Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne 2019 and beyond, following a consultation and development process begun in 2016. The new system, in which dancers compete in 2 rounds of "heats" prior to the existing 3 round structure (redesignated "finals"), was implemented to deal with rising qualification numbers and venue management difficulties. Announcing the system, chairperson of An Coimisiún James McCutcheon also noted the morale benefits of having an intermediate goal for dancers between qualification and final round recall.&lt;ref name="2019 Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCutcheon|first1=James|title=Important Notice Regarding Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne 2019|url=https://gallery.mailchimp.com/cba3b6d2a3267591cd7719ea2/files/ac15f37b-6552-4726-80dc-53f8f82b65ab/Important_Notice_regarding_Oireachtas_Rince_na_Cruinne_2019.pdf|publisher=An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha|accessdate=25 January 2018|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne is organised and overseen by An Coimisiún's Coiste Oireachtaisí (Oireachtas Committee), which is also responsible for the annual All-Ireland Championships. The committee's budget is set by Comhairle Bainistaíochta (the Council of Management).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oireachtas Committee|url=https://www.clrg.ie/index.php/en/about-us/structure/oireachtas-committee.html|publisher=An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chair of the Oireachtas Committee is elected each year at the [[annual general meeting]] of An Coimisiún.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=30}}

Locations for Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne are selected following a bidding process, which allows regional representatives to submit their preferred venue for consideration. Bidding is led by both local An Coimisiún teachers and business representatives.&lt;ref name="Kerryman 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerry to tender for lucrative Irish Dancing championships – Independent.ie|url=http://www.independent.ie/regionals/kerryman/news/kerry-to-tender-for-lucrative-irish-dancing-championships-34167321.html|accessdate=6 October 2017|work=The Kerryman|date=7 November 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final decision is made by a vote of the Oireachtas Committee,&lt;ref name="IT 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Velasquez|first1=Sarah|title=World Irish dancing contest takes big step to US|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world-irish-dancing-contest-takes-big-step-to-us-1.742603|accessdate=6 October 2017|work=The Irish Times|date=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking into account the suitability of venue and the area's capacity to support the event with appropriate accommodation.{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=184}}

The approximate cost of staging Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne has been estimated at {{currency|400000|gbp}}, which is covered by grants from local authorities and entrance fees from dancers.&lt;ref name="BCC costs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Agenda item – Bidding for International Events|url=https://minutes3.belfastcity.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=730|publisher=Belfast City Council|accessdate=25 October 2017|date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=185}} The event does not receive any funding from the [[Irish government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rynne|first1=Colin|last2=Buttimer|first2=Neil|last3=Guerin|first3=Helen|title=The heritage of Ireland|date=2000|publisher=Collins Press|isbn=9781898256151|pages=222–223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBEXAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|One of the historical reasons for the lack of government support is An Coimisiún's reluctance to allow its dancers to participate in other dance forms and cultural activities.{{sfn|Whelan|2000|p=20}} }} It has been estimated that the event contributes {{currency|15000000|eur}} to local economies, in addition to flow-on social and economic benefits.{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=184}} One such outcome is the exposure of an entire city or region to thousands of potential tourists; as a result, Boston tourism authorities compared the total impact of the Worlds on the local economy to that of the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name="BIR Mar 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Sean|title='The Olympics of Irish Dancing': Boston readies for 7-day festival|work=Boston Irish Reporter|date=March 2013|url=http://www.bostonirish.com/sites/default/files/issue/BIR%203-13-web.pdf|access-date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most direct economic benefit is created by high booking rates at nearby [[hotel]]s and [[restaurant]]s.&lt;ref name="BBC 2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dancers on world class form|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3599893.stm|accessdate=25 October 2017|work=BBC News|date=5 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Belfast event in 2004 saw every hotel room in the city centre occupied for the duration of the championships.&lt;ref name="Belfast 2004 hotel rooms"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wallace |first1=Ashleigh |title=The Waterfront Hall is getting ready for the World Irish Dancing Championships ; Belfast Set to 'Reel' in thousands of visitors |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=3 April 2004 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualification ==
[[File:Connacht Championships Irish stepdance medal.jpg|A medal awarded to Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne qualifiers at the Connacht Oireachtas.|right|thumb]]
Solo dancers must qualify for Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne at a qualifying event recognised by An Coimisiún. There are two classes of qualifying event: "primary qualifiers" open only to dancers in a particular region, and "secondary qualifiers" on a national or international scale.{{efn|Each of the secondary qualifiers, with the exception of the Australian Championships, is open to competitors from anywhere in the world, however, only local dancers may qualify for Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne at a given event.{{sfn|Venable|2001|p=283}} }} In some regions of the United States, pre-qualification for qualifiers is required.&lt;ref name="IrishCentral qualify"&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Darlene M.|title=How to qualify to compete at an Irish dance Oireachtas – Links to schedules and video of winners|url=https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/how-to-qualify-to-compete-at-an-irish-dance-oireachtas-links-to-schedules-and-video-of-winners-129337538-238102001|website=IrishCentral|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en|date=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each section at both primary and secondary qualifiers (according to the age groups of Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne) the top 5 placed dancers qualify, as well as an additional dancer for every 10 participants in the section. Generally speaking, all dancers must compete and qualify at their primary qualifier; however, dancers who fail to do so may qualify at their secondary qualifier or may be eligible for automatic qualification if they placed in a medal winning position at the previous Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|p=17}} Dancers who do not participate in their primary qualifier may not qualify secondarily or automatically unless they submit a valid reason, such as a medical condition, to An Coimisiún.{{efn|Ineligibility to compete under the "transfer rule", which excludes dancers from competition for six months after transferring dance schools, is not considered a valid reason.

This system was introduced in 1981 after the establishment of regions in North America, in order to give dancers a second opportunity to qualify for the Worlds if their result at a regional qualifier was unusually poor. The secondary qualification system was subsequently introduced for all regions.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=94}}

World Qualifier status is considered prestigious by dancers in its own right.&lt;ref name="ID Mag qualifiers" /&gt; Indeed, the chief aspiration of many competitive dancers is simply to participate in Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne.{{sfn|Whelan|2000|p=34}}  A large number of dancers who qualify for Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne do not attend, primarily because of the expense of international travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Karen|title=World Irish Dancing Championships come to Boston |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2013/03/16/world-irish-dancing-championships-come-boston/KFPJjKznL4fBKhKg1Vy5oM/story.html|accessdate=28 October 2017|work=The Boston Globe|date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The qualification system places a disproportionate restriction on the number of female dancers at the Worlds, and consequently produces a female–male ratio of competitors much lower than at other Irish stepdance events. The massive increase in dancer numbers following Riverdance in 1994, however, did increase this ratio substantially, as the increase in female competitors was not matched by an increase in male competitors.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=118–119}}

== Adjudication ==
Adjudicators for Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne are selected from An Coimisiún's registered adjudicators, who may apply to adjudicate if they have at least two years' experience judging major competitions. Adjudicators may not judge at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne more than once in a five-year period.{{sfn|Rules|2016|loc=5.4.3–5.4.7}} The final selection of the adjudicator pool takes into account experience, reputation and knowledge of competitive Irish stepdancing,&lt;ref name="Swindon 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leighton|first1=Barry|title=It's a serious business this Irish dancing thing...even if you don't know your jigs from your reels|url=http://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/news/10270448.It___s_a_serious_business_this_Irish_dancing_thing___even_if_you_don___t_know_your_jigs_from_your_reels/|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=Swindon Advertiser|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the members of the pool are notified that they have been selected in the December prior to the Worlds.&lt;ref name="CLRG adj letter"&gt;{{cite web |title=INVITATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BALLOT FOR SELECTION TO THE PANEL OF ADJUDICATORS |url=https://www.clrg.ie/images/Letter_of_invitationORC2017.docx |publisher=An Coimisiún le Rincí Gaelacha |accessdate=13 July 2018 |page=1 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all competitions run by An Coimisiún, adjudicators may not judge dancers with whom they are associated. This includes dancers whom they or their relatives have taught in the previous two years, or dancers to whom they are related.{{sfn|Rules|2016|loc=5.3}} As it is not feasible to select adjudicators who have no direct or indirect relationship to dancers at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, dancers associated with the selected adjudicators are forbidden from competing once the adjudicator pool is announced, and their qualification status is automatically carried over to the following edition of the Worlds.&lt;ref name="IC adjudicators"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly-Wild|first1=Kathleen|title=2012 World Irish Dancing Championships international judging panel|url=https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/2012-world-irish-dancing-championships-international-judging-panel-145233065-238126501|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=IrishCentral|date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the pool selected, a ballot is publicly drawn on each morning of the Championships to determine the makeup of adjudication panels for each of the day's sections.{{sfn|Wulff|2007|p=101}} There are three separate panels for each day of the Championships, with seven members each.{{sfn|Information|2017|p=2}}{{efn|In previous years, due to logistical limitations, some panels were composed of only five members.{{sfn|Whelan|2000|p=34}} }}

The decisions of adjudicators are final, and there exists no mechanism by which to question scores or rankings.&lt;ref name="Meyer1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meyer|first1=Moe|title=Dance and the Politics of Orality: A Study of the Irish "Scoil Rince"|journal=Dance Research Journal|date=1995|volume=27|issue=1|pages=25–39|doi=10.2307/1478428|jstor=1478428}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that this system contributes to political and personal biases among adjudication panels. In addition, participants in Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne frequently accuse adjudicators (though not directly) of politicising their decisions or favouring dancers of one region over another.{{sfn|Wulff|2007|p=100}}

== Competitions ==
=== Solo championships ===
{{see also|Oireachtas (Irish dance)}}
There are 25 solo championships: a male and female championship for each of 11 age groups between 10–11 years and 20–21 years, female 21–23 years, female over 23 and male over 21. All age groups encompass a single calendar year of birth with the exceptions of the "Ladies 21–23 years" championship, which covers two birth years, and the "Ladies over 23" and "Men over 21" championships, to which no upper age limit is applied. The youngest age group is 10–11 years.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|pp=4–6}} In general, the sections for younger age groups are held earlier in the week of the Championships.{{sfn|Wulff|2007|p=99}}

==== Dances ====
Each solo championship consists of three rounds, as do other stepdance competitions named as "championships".&lt;ref name="MJP Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=First Time Championship and Oireachtas Guide|url=http://www.mjpacademy.com/PDF/Championship%20and%20Oireachtas%20Handbook.pdf|website=MJP Academy|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first round, danced in [[Irish stepdance#Hard shoes|hard shoes]], is either a [[Jig|double jig]] or [[hornpipe]] depending on age group; the second round, in [[Irish stepdance#Soft shoes|soft shoes]] consists of either [[slip jig]] or [[reel]].{{efn|By tradition, male dancers do not perform the slip jig, and hence compete with reel at every age group.{{refn|name=Bennett2015|{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Bill|title=Feis 101: The Basic Stuff You Need to Know About Irish Dancing Competition|date=17 June 2015|publisher=Bennett School of Irish Dance|page=4|url=http://www.bennett-school.com/Private/Home/Home_files/Feis%20101.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2017}}}}}} Jigs and slip jigs are danced for 48 bars, while hornpipes and reels are danced for 40 bars.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|pp=4–6}}

After the first two rounds, scores are tabulated and a percentage of top-ranked dancers are "recalled". These competitors perform the third, or "set dance" round, in hard shoes, one at a time.{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=185}} The "set" of the name refers to a particular tune, rather than to any specified choreography.{{efn|The set dance round is also unrelated to [[Irish set dance|set dance]], another form of traditional Irish dance.}} The set dance at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne is performed in a contrasting time to the first round&amp;nbsp;– that is, if the dancer performed a hornpipe ({{time signature|4|4}} time) in the first round, they must perform a jig ({{time signature|6|8}} time) in the set dance round, and vice versa.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|pp=5–6}} There are 30 set dance tunes approved for use at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|p=7}}

==== Placing and awards ====
After the three rounds have been completed and final scores tabulated, the individual place scores for each dancer are read in public and simultaneously revealed on video displays throughout the venue. The final placings are then read in order from first to last.{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=189}} Only dancers who have completed all three rounds may be placed in this way.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|p=4}}

A formula in each year's syllabus describes the number of competitors who will be awarded prizes, which is dependent on the total number of dancers in the section.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|p=18}} These dancers are presented on the stage individually in an official presentation ceremony, and awarded a "World medal".{{sfn|Wulff|2007|p=100}} The top five dancers in each section ascend a [[dais]],{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=189}} and are presented with a distinctive perpetual trophy colloquially known as a "globe", as well as other trophies available in each section.&lt;ref name="Carrickfergus 2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ulidia Irish dancer is world champion|url=http://www.carrickfergustimes.co.uk/news/ulidia-irish-dancer-is-world-champion-1-7314165|accessdate=6 October 2017|work=Carrickfergus Times|date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The globe trophies were originally donated in 2007 by [[Michael Flatley]] and the first place versions include the names of all previous section winners inscribed around the base.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=112}} Winners of male sections are frequently presented with a belt as a trophy, a practice which originated at a dance competition held in 1895 by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=167}}

It is usual for winners of a section to be described as having "won the Worlds", even though there is no mechanism by which to win the whole event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Darrah|date=April 2001|title=Irish Dance Picks Up the Pace|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-72273994/irish-dance-picks-up-the-pace|journal=Dance Magazine|language=en|volume=75|issue=4|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for older winners of the World Championships to retire from competitive dance immediately afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=Dance: The Next Generation|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=LowOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=irish+dancing+worlds+musician&amp;dq=irish+dancing+worlds+musician&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-oaXT2I3XAhVDJpQKHZTDC104FBDoAQg_MAU|journal=Irish America|publisher=Irish Voice, Incorporated|volume=19|page=89 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-2019 ====
For Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne 2019 onwards, a "double recall" system of 5 dancing rounds will be implemented. During the "heats", each age group will compete in a hard shoe and soft shoe dance, similar to the pre-2019 system. However, each competition will be divided in a [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] fashion into two "splits" of equal size. Following these two rounds, a list of recalled dancers will be publicly announced; these dancers will move to the "finals" on the following day.{{efn|At the January 2018 meeting of An Coimisiún, the proportion of recalled dancers was not determined.}} 

The finals day of competition will be judged by a new panel of adjudicators, and will operate with the same three-round structure as the pre-2019 system. The number of dancers progressing to the set dance round, as a proportion of the original entry numbers, will remain the same.

{{As of|January 2018}}, An Coimisiún was considering retaining the pre-2019 system for all male sections and female age groups U11 and U12.&lt;ref name="2019 Announcement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dances 2019"&gt;{{cite web|title=Agreed Dances for Qualifying Events leading up to Oireactas Rince na Cruinne 2019|url=https://gallery.mailchimp.com/cba3b6d2a3267591cd7719ea2/files/21392444-50f7-4d71-846d-e124e7a41b8c/Required_dances_for_Worlds_2019.pdf|publisher=An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team championships ===
==== Ceili championships ====
There are nine championships for [[ceili dance]] at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne: five age groups for girls' teams, and four for mixed gender teams.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|p=11}} The ceili dances performed at the Worlds are those which have been accepted by An Coimisiún as part of the stepdance tradition and which are found in the official publication of dances, ''Ar Rince Ceili''.&lt;ref name="Foley 2001" /&gt;{{efn|Until its revision in 2014, this manual was known as ''Ar Rince Foirne''.}} Presently, the only ceili dances accepted at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne are eight-hand dances, that is, for eight dancers.

==== Figure dancing championships ====
Figure dances are dances of eight to sixteen dancers, originally composed but performed to [[Irish traditional music]].{{efn|The term "figure dance" is sometimes also used to refer to ceili dances, but at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne has always referred to a separate competition.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=55}} }} Performed both for competition and exhibition, they are required to portray an Irish theme or item through the dance.{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=237}} A figure dancing championship, for "newly composed dances that would be suitable for performance at a [[Ceilidh|ceílí]]", was included at the first Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=58}} After the Dance Drama section was spun off in 1974, the figure dance section was intended to retain a more traditional style.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=55}}

Dancers in figure dance teams at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne are required to dance basic steps such as those found in approved ceili dances, and choreographies must not exceed 4 minutes. There are between 8 and 16 dancers in each team. Before each dance, the story portrayed by the dance is read aloud by the stage steward. It is common for figure dance teams to supply their own recorded music, which has the advantage of enabling changes in tempo and time signature through the dance, but live accompaniment is permitted. Figure dance teams are judged on their ability to portray the story, the quality of the choreography, individual footwork and technique, and the team's synchronisation and presentation.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|pp=12–13}}

There are five figure dance championships: three age groups for girls teams, including an open age group, and two age groups for mixed teams (with a minimum of 4 male dancers) including an open age group.{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|p=14}} The senior figure dancing competition is considered among the most prestigious sections at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, a reputation which it carried from its predecessor competition at the All-Ireland Championships.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|p=132}}

==== Dance Drama championships ====
The Dance Drama championship was conceived following the 1973 Worlds to distinguish the traditional figure dance section from more modern choreographies which involved the use of [[Theatrical property|props]] and costume changes. Introduced in 1974, the section was renamed "Dance Drama" for the 1978 Worlds.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=55–56}} Within a few years, Dance Drama was one of the most broadly popular sections at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne.{{sfn|Wulff|2007|p=105}}

Dance Drama teams are composed of between 8 and 20 dancers. The choreography is required to portray a "specifically Irish historical or traditional story, event or theme" and may be between 4 and 6 minutes in length, as well as a five-minute period before and after the performance for preparing and clearing the stage. Like the figure dance, the story accompanying the choreography is read publicly beforehand, and it is common for music to be pre-recorded. Simple changes of [[stage lighting]] and the use of portable props are permitted during the choreography. Teams are judged on the quality of choreography, execution of dancing, costuming and the "impact on adjudicator".{{sfn|Syllabus|2018|p=15}} The style of choreography has been described as a combination of Irish dance with [[physical theatre]], due to its heavy reliance on [[mime]] and facial expression, and is of particular attraction to professional choreographers.&lt;ref name="Sagolla 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sagolla|first1=Lisa Jo|title=Keeping in Step With Irish Dance|journal=Back Stage|date=14 June 2011|volume=52|issue=27|pages=7, 11|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/881338577|accessdate=2 November 2017|language=en|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains elements of eighteenth-century [[pantomime]].{{sfn|Wulff|2007|p=105}}

Since 2002, the Dance Drama event has been held in a separate venue to the main Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne competitions. Later, a special printed program was introduced for the event to cater for increased ticket sales among general audiences. In addition, interval acts were added to maintain a professional quality while the stage was reset for each team's performance.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=59–61}} The Dance Drama event, along with the figure dancing championship, is often described as the "highlight" of the World Championships.{{sfn|Wulff|2007|p=23}}

== Music ==
[[Accompaniment|Musical accompaniment]] for the dancers has been provided by live musicians throughout the history of Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne; the only exceptions are the figure dance and Dance Drama championships where pre-recorded accompaniment is increasingly common. Modern practice is that the usual instruments are [[piano accordion]] and [[electronic keyboard]],{{sfn|Foley|2016|p=188}} although music has been provided on other traditional instruments such as [[fiddle]]. Accompanists at the Worlds are increasingly former dancers or practising teachers, as the demands of providing music for dance competitions require an understanding of the environment.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=113–114}}

== Concurrent events and facilities ==
An [[opening ceremony]] including formalities with An Coimisiún and Gaelic League officials, as well as entertainment items, is held on the first day of the championships.{{sfn|Information|2017|p=3}} This ceremony often includes representation of the countries in attendance with flags.&lt;ref name="IT 2009" /&gt; The Oireachtas Committee also organises performances from local entertainers, including regional [[folk dance]]rs and [[folk music]]ians to increase the event's appeal to the general public.&lt;ref name="CLI Montreal"&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD IRISH DANCE CHAMPIONSHIPS – Celtic Life International|url=https://celticlife.com/world-irish-dance-championships/|website=Celtic Life International|accessdate=7 December 2017|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large facility in close proximity to the competition venue is typically set aside for vendors of dance–related products. These include [[Irish stepdance#Shoes|specialised shoes]], [[wig]]s, [[makeup]] and memorabilia. Designers of [[Irish stepdance#Costume|competition costumes]] also operate stalls to promote their design services.&lt;ref name="Rainey2014" /&gt;

A practice floor is set aside for competing dancers to warm up before their competition.{{sfn|Information|2017|p=2}}

== Publicity ==
Local dignitaries, including [[ambassador]]s of Ireland and other countries represented at the Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, are frequently involved with the event. The Worlds have also been attended by the [[President of Ireland]] on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Cullinane|2016|pp=108–109}}

A 1995 documentary, by producer Michele Fox for [[London Weekend Television]], examined Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, held that year in Dublin.&lt;ref name="Michele Fox obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Gerald|title=Obituary: Michele Fox|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-michele-fox-1284794.html|accessdate=16 November 2017|work=The Independent|date=24 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD3Ib0uoeD8 |title=World Irish Dancing Documentary |date=1995 |publisher=LWT Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 [[Sue Bourne]] film ''[[Jig (film)|Jig]]'' followed eight dancers on their journey to the 40th World Championships, held in Glasgow in 2010.&lt;ref name="JigReview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catsoulis|first1=Jeannette|title='Jig' Review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/movies/jig-review.html?mcubz=0|accessdate=21 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne initially struggled to obtain permission for the film from An Coimisiún because of their concerns about protecting dancers' original [[choreography]], but was eventually allowed to produce the film on the basis of its potential publicity benefits.&lt;ref name="McIver2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McIver|first1=Brian|title=Jig Time: New Movie Uncovers Secret World of Irish Dancing|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-254581114/jig-time-new-movie-uncovers-secret-world-of-irish|accessdate=21 September 2017|work=The Daily Record|date=23 April 2011|language=en|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Coimisiún Le Rincí Gaelacha has officially expressed disappointment that the Worlds do not receive proportionate media coverage when held in Ireland, given that the event is not typically attended by any [[television station]]s like the Irish national broadcaster [[RTÉ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bray|first1=Allison|last2=Armstrong|first2=Kathy|title=World Irish Dancing Championships hoping for a leg-up with TV coverage|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/world-irish-dancing-championships-hoping-for-a-legup-with-tv-coverage-35615966.html|accessdate=21 September 2017|work=Irish Independent|date=12 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otronicon''' ('''O'''rlando Elec'''tron'''ic '''I'''nteractive '''Con'''vention) is an electronic gaming and simulation conference. The first annual convention was held at the [[Orlando Science Center]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[United States]] in January 2006. The fourth annual event was held January 16-20th, 2009 at the [[Orlando Science Center]]. Events included tournaments, workshops, retro gaming including a small version of the [[Videotopia]] videogame history museum exhibit, gaming movies, and [[simulator|simulations]]. The event in 2009 was sponsored by [[Full Sail University]], a programming and gaming-development [[university]] located outside of Orlando, FL. Otronicon ran for ten days in its inaugural show. It was also held at the [[Orlando Science Center]] during the 2007 and 2008 convention. It contained such game systems as the following: [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Guitar Hero]], and many Flight Simulators such as Helicopters, Cars, and the Original [[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]. The 2013 convention took place on January 18–21, 2013.

'''PROBA-3''' is the third satellite mission in the [[European Space Agency]]'s series of [[PROBA]] low-cost [[satellite]]s that are being used to validate new spacecraft technologies while also carrying scientific instruments. 

==Overview==
PROBA-3 will be composed of two independent, three-axis stabilized spacecraft flying at 150 meters to one another with the ability to accurately control the attitude and separation of the two craft. Their alignment with the [[Sun]] will be maintained for 6 hours, creating ″artificial solar eclipse″ for the back satellite. The spacecraft pair will fly a highly elliptical orbit divided between periods of accurate formation flying around [[apogee]], when payload operations will be possible, and periods of free flight. The length of the formation control period will be a trade-off involving the increasing amount of fuel needed to maintain the orbits in formation when  away from apogee.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Proba_Missions/Mission2|title=Mission / PROBA-3|publisher=[[ESA]]|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary mission of PROBA-3 is [[Sun|solar]] [[coronagraphy]] by using the telescope on the larger of the two satellites to view the Sun's corona while the other spacecraft is maneuvered to accurately occult the disc of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Proba_Missions/Science_payload|title=Science Payload / PROBA-3|publisher=[[ESA]]|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017 PROBA-3 is scheduled to be launched in {{Date|2020}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESA_Publications/ESA_Publications_Bulletin/ESA_Bulletin_160_Nov_2014|title=ESA Bulletin 160 (November 2014)|format=PDF|page=61|issn=0376-4265|publisher=[[ESA]]|date=November 2014|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Proba_Missions/About_Proba-3|title=About PROBA-3|publisher=[[ESA]]|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was planned to have a lifetime of around two years.

'''Political repression of cyber-dissidents''' is the [[oppression]] or [[persecution]] of people for expressing their [[political]] views on the [[Internet]].

Along with development of the [[Internet]], state authorities in many parts of the world are moving forward to install [[mass surveillance]] of the electronic communications, establish [[Internet censorship]] to limit the flow of information, and persecute individuals and groups who express "inconvenient" political views in the Internet. Many [[cyber-dissident]]s have found themselves [[persecution|persecuted]] for attempts to bypass [[State (polity)|state]] controlled [[news media]].  [[Reporters Without Borders]] has released a ''[[iarchive:media_Handbook-for-Bloggers-and-Cyber-Dissidents|Handbook For Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents]]'' and maintains a roster of currently imprisoned cyber-dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/barometer|title=Violations of press freedom barometer|work=Reporters without borders|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that departments of provincial and municipal governments in [[mainland China]] began creating "teams of internet commentators, whose job is to guide discussion on public bulletin boards away from politically sensitive topics by posting opinions anonymously or under false names" in 2005 &lt;ref name="China" /&gt; Applicants for the job were drawn mostly from the propaganda and police departments.

{{Population transfer}}
'''Population transfer in the Soviet Union''' refers to [[forced transfer]] of various groups from the 1930s up to the 1950s ordered by [[Joseph Stalin]] and may be classified into the following broad categories: deportations of "[[anti-Soviet]]" categories of population (often classified as "[[enemies of workers]]"), deportations of entire nationalities, labor force transfer, and organized migrations in opposite directions to fill the [[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] territories.

In most cases, their destinations were underpopulated remote areas (see [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union]]). This includes deportations to the [[Soviet Union]] of non-Soviet citizens from countries outside the USSR. It has been estimated that, in their entirety, internal forced migrations affected at least 6 million people.{{Sfn|Polian|2004|p=4}}&lt;ref name="Rosefielde83"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Red Holocaust (2009 book)|Red Holocaust]] |last= Rosefielde |first= Steven |authorlink= Steven Rosefielde |coauthors= |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Routledge]] |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-77757-5 |page=83 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Ellman|2002|p=1159}} Of this total, 1.8 million [[kulaks]] were deported in 1930–31, 1.0 million peasants and ethnic minorities in 1932–39, whereas about 3.5 million ethnic minorities were further resettled during 1940–52.{{Sfn|Ellman|2002|p=1159}}

Some 1 to 1.5 million perished as a result of the deportations — of those deaths, the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|deportation of Crimean Tatars]] and the [[Aardakh|deportation of Chechens]] were recognized as [[genocide]]s by [[Ukraine]] and the [[European Parliament]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unpo.org/article/438 UNPO: Chechnya: European Parliament recognizes the genocide of the Chechen People in 1944]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Naimark|Naimark, Norman M.]] ''Stalin's Genocides (Human Rights and Crimes against Humanity).''

== Deportation of social groups ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
{{main|Dekulakization}}{{main|Decossackization}}
[[Kulak]]s were a group of relatively affluent farmers and had gone by this [[class system]] term in the later Russian Empire, Soviet Russia, and early Soviet Union. They were the most numerous group deported by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulaghistory.org/exhibits/nps/onlineexhibit/stalin/crimes.php |title=Gulag: Soviet Forced Labor Camps and the Struggle for Freedom |publisher=Gulaghistory.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resettlement of people officially designated as ''kulaks'' continued until early 1950, including several major waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&amp;SubjectID=1929collectivization&amp;Year=1929] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321020323/http://www.soviethistory.org/index.php?action=L2&amp;SubjectID=1929collectivization&amp;Year=1929|date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of kulaks regardless of their nationality were resettled to [[Siberia]] and [[Central Asia]]. According to data from Soviet archives, which were published in 1990, 1,803,392 people were sent to labor colonies and camps in 1930 and 1931, and 1,317,022 reached the destination. Deportations on a smaller scale continued after 1931. The reported number of kulaks and their relatives who had died in labour colonies from 1932 to 1940 was 389,521.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.cyberone.com.au/myers/courtois.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114220819/http://users.cyberone.com.au/myers/courtois.html|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 15 million kulaks and their families were deported by 1937, during the deportation many people died, but the full number is not known.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar|last=Sebag Montefiore|first=Simon|publisher=W&amp;N|year=2014|isbn=978-1780228358|location=|pages=84|quote=By 1937, 18,5 million were collevtivized but there were now only 19.9 million households: 5.7 million households, perhaps 15 million persons, had been deported, many of them dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic operations==
[[File:Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina 03.jpg|thumb|A train with Romanian refugees following the [[Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet annexation of Bessarabia]]]]
During the 1930s, categorisation of so-called enemies of the people shifted from the usual [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]], class-based terms, such as ''kulak'', to ethnic-based ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The partial removal of potentially trouble-making ethnic groups was a technique used consistently by [[Joseph Stalin]] during his government;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pohl|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; between 1935 and 1938 alone, at least nine different nationalities were deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1998|p=815}}. Poles, Germans, Finns, Estonians, Latvians, Koreans, Chinese, Kurds, and Iranians.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union]] led to a massive escalation in Soviet ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1998|p=820}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union]], originally conceived in 1926, initiated in 1930, and carried through in 1937, was the first mass transfer of an entire nationality in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Pohl, ''Ethnic cleansing in the USSR, 1937–1949'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, pp. 9–20; partially viewable on [https://books.google.com/books?id=SnLANpCfDn4C&amp;dq=otto+pohl+ethnic&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4dlWm_mMFX&amp;sig=DFKVIa1TkqZCpL-cZOHP8-0VQQs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NAk6SqbZHo-X_QawlrSoCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPA9,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the entire Soviet population of [[Koreans|ethnic Koreans]] (171,781 persons) were [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|forcefully moved]] from the [[Russian Far East]] to unpopulated areas of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] and the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]] in October 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2009/063/22.html First deportation and the "Effective manager"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620231557/http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2009/063/22.html |date=20 June 2009 }}, [[Novaya gazeta]], by [[Pavel Polian|Pavel Polyan]] and Nikolai Pobol&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the entire period of Stalin's rule, one can list: [[Poles]] (1939–1941 and 1944–1945), [[Romanians]] (1941 and 1944–1953), [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]], [[Latvian people|Latvians]], [[Estonians]] (1941 and 1945–1949), [[Volga German]]s (1941–1945), [[Ingrian Finns]] (1929–1931 and 1935–1939), [[Finns|Finnish people in Karelia]] (1940–1941, 1944), [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Greeks in Ukraine|Crimean Greeks]] (1944) and [[Caucasus]] Greeks (1949–50), [[Kalmyks]], [[Balkars]], [[Karachays]], [[Meskhetian Turks]], [[Karapapaks]], [[Koreans|Far East Koreans]] (1937), [[Chechen people|Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingushs]] (1944).  Shortly before, during and immediately after [[World War II]], Stalin conducted a series of deportations on a huge scale which profoundly affected the ethnic map of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/WCR-German_Soviet.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Scale and Nature of German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930–45 |author=Stephen Wheatcroft |publisher=Sovietinfo.tripod.com |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that between 1941 and 1949 nearly 3.3 million were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lYMsIE5KjmMC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=stalin+deportations+tatar |title=The Stalin Era – Philip Boobbyer – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17|isbn=9780415182980 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By some estimates, up to 43% of the resettled population died of [[infectious diseases|diseases]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/USSR.TAB1B.GIF |format=GIF |title=Table 1B : Soviet Transit, Camp and Deportation Death Rates|publisher=Hawaii.edu |accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deportations started with Poles from [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] and European Russia (see [[Polish minority in Soviet Union]]) between 1932 and 1936. [[Koryo-saram|Koreans]] in the [[Russian Far East]] were deported in 1937. (See [[Deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union]].)

===Western annexations and deportations, 1939–1941===
[[File:Deportee barrack in the Kolyma region.jpg|thumb|Deportee barrack in the [[Kolyma]] region, 1957|left]]
After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]] following the corresponding [[invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion]] that marked the start of World War II in 1939, the Soviet Union annexed eastern parts (known as ''[[Kresy]]'' to the Polish) of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. During 1939–1941, 1.45 million people inhabiting the region were deported by the Soviet regime, of whom 63.1% were Poles and 7.4% were [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Poland's Holocaust, Tadeusz Piotrowski, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7864-0371-3}}, P.14&lt;/ref&gt; Previously it was believed that about 1.0 million Polish citizens died at the hands of the Soviets,&lt;ref&gt;Franciszek Proch, Poland's Way of the Cross, New York 1987 P.146&lt;/ref&gt; but recently Polish historians, based mostly on queries in Soviet archives, estimate the number of deaths at about 350,000 people deported in 1939–1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/european_WWII_casualties.htm |title=European WWII Casualties |publisher=Project InPosterum |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/wrobel2.htm |title=Piotr Wrobel.

The same followed in the [[Baltic States|Baltic republics]] of [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]], [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]] and [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]] (see [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]] and [[Soviet deportations from Lithuania]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/History-of-Occupation/briefing-paper4/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709020049/http://www.am.gov.lv/en/latvia/History-of-Occupation/briefing-paper4/|date=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been deported from the Baltic in 1940–1953. In addition, at least 75,000 were sent to the [[Gulag]]. 10% of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to labor camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahtg.net/TpA/baltstat.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420175950/http://www.ahtg.net/TpA/baltstat.html|date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rel.ee/eng/communism_crimes.htm |title=Taigi veebimüük &amp;#124; Taig.ee |publisher=Rel.ee |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010301223347/http://www.rel.ee/eng/communism_crimes.htm |archivedate=1 March 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, native Latvians represented only 52% of the population of their own country.

Likewise, [[Romanians]] from [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovia]] had been deported in great numbers which range from 200,000 to 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.east-west-wg.org/cst/cst-mold/bessara.html |title=east-west-wg.org |publisher=east-west-wg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913005040/http://www.east-west-wg.org/cst/cst-mold/bessara.html |archivedate=13 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Soviet deportations from Bessarabia]].)

[[File:Lavrenti Beria Stalins family.jpg|thumb|Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Lavrenti Beria]] (in foreground). As head of the [[NKVD]], Beria was responsible for mass deportations of ethnic minorities.]]
During World War II, particularly in 1943–44, the Soviet government conducted a series of [[deportation]]s. Some 1.9 million people were deported to Siberia and the Central Asian republics. Treasonous collaboration with the invading [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and anti-Soviet rebellion were the official reasons for these deportations. Out of approximately 183,000 Crimean Tatars, 20,000 or 10% of the entire population served in German battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Statiev, "The Nature of Anti-Soviet Armed Resistance, 1942–44", ''[[Kritika (journal)|Kritika]]: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History'' (Spring 2005) 285–318&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, [[Tatars]] too were transferred en masse by the Soviets after the war.&lt;ref&gt;A.

All Crimean Tatars were deported ''en masse'', in a form of [[collective punishment]], on 18 May 1944 as [[special settler]]s to [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]] and other distant parts of the Soviet Union. According to [[NKVD]] data, nearly 20% died in exile during the following year and a half.

Other minorities evicted from the [[Black Sea]] coastal region included [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks in Ukraine|Crimean Greeks]], [[Romanians]] and [[Armenians]].

===Post-war expulsion and deportation===

After World War II, the [[Germans|German]] population of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], former [[East Prussia]] was [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] and the depopulated area resettled by Soviet citizens, mainly by [[Russians]].

[[Poland]] and [[Soviet Ukraine]] conducted population exchanges; Poles who resided east of the established Poland–Soviet border were deported to Poland (c.a. 2,100,000 persons) and [[Ukrainians]] that resided west of the established Poland-Soviet Union border were deported to Soviet Ukraine. Population transfer to Soviet Ukraine occurred from September 1944 to April 1946 (ca. 450,000 persons). Some Ukrainians (ca. 200,000 persons) left southeast Poland more or less voluntarily (between 1944 and 1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationeducation.org/13.0.html |title=MIGRATION CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION – Forced migration in the 20th century |publisher=Migrationeducation.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021014423/http://www.migrationeducation.org/13.0.html |archivedate=21 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rumsiskes jurta.jpg|thumb|A dwelling typical to some deportees into Siberia in a museum in [[Rumšiškės]], Lithuania]]

===Post-Stalin policy on deportation===
In February 1956, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in his speech ''[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences]]'' condemned the deportations as a violation of [[Leninism|Leninist]] principles, asserting as a joke that the [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]] avoided such a fate "only because there were too many of them and there was no place to which to deport them."{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} His government reversed most of Stalin's deportations.

This did not include the Crimean Tatars, Meskhetian Turks and Volga Germans, however. They were only allowed to return ''en masse'' to their homelands after 1991. The deportations had a profound effect on the non-Russian peoples of the Soviet Union and they are still a major political issue; the memory of the deportations played a major part in the separatist movements in [[Chechnya]] and the Baltic republics.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Some peoples were deported after Stalin's death: in 1959, Chechen returnees were supplanted from the mountains to the Chechen plain. The mountain peoples of [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajikistan]], such as the [[Yaghnobi people]], were forcibly settled to the desert plains in the 1970s.

According to a secret Soviet ministry of interior report dated December 1965, for the period 1940—1953, 46,000 people were deported from Moldova, 61,000 from Belarus, 571,000 from Ukraine, 119,000 from Lithuania, 53,000 from Latvia and 33,000 from Estonia.{{sfn|Mawdsley|1998|p=73}}

==Labor force transfer==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
Punitive transfers of population transfers handled by the [[Gulag]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=1 |title=Getman Paintings &amp;#124; The Jamestown Foundation |publisher=Jamestown.org |date=2015-01-20 |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024202420/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=1 |archivedate=24 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the system of [[forced settlements in the Soviet Union]] were planned in accordance with the needs of the [[colonization]] of the remote and underpopulated territories of the [[Soviet Union]]. (Their large scale has led to a controversial opinion in the West that the economic growth of the Soviet Union was largely based on the [[slave labor]] of Gulag prisoners.) At the same time, on a number of occasions the workforce was transferred by non-violent means, usually by means of "recruitment" (''вербовка''). This kind of recruitment was regularly performed at forced settlements, where people were naturally more willing to resettle. For example, the workforce of the [[Donbass]] and [[Kuznetsk Basin|Kuzbass]] mining basins is known to have been replenished in this way. (As a note of historical comparison, in [[Imperial Russia]] the mining workers at state mines (''bergals'', "бергалы", from German ''Bergbau'', 'mining') were often recruited in lieu of military service which, for a certain period, had a term of 25 years).

There were several notable campaigns of targeted workforce transfer.
*[[Twenty-five-thousander]]s
*[[NKVD labor columns]]
*[[Virgin Lands Campaign]]
*[[Baku]] oil industry workers transfer: During the [[German-Soviet War]], in October 1942, about 10,000 workers from the petroleum sites of Baku, together with their families, were transferred to several sites with potential oil production (the "Second Baku" area ([[Volga River|Volga]]-[[Ural River|Ural]] oil field), [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] and [[Sakhalin]]), in face of the potential German threat, although Germany failed to seize Baku.

==Repatriation after World War II==
[[File:На вокзале. 1957 год Фрунзе. Жители с. Юрт-Аух.jpg|thumb|Vainakhs returning to the Caucasus in 1957]]
When the war ended in May 1945, millions of Soviet citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated]] (against their will) into the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;''The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944–47'' by Mark Elliott Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 88, No. 2 (Jun., 1973), pp. 253–275&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the United States and United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825141441/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp|date=25 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretation of this Agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets regardless of their wishes. British and U.S. civilian authorities ordered their military forces in Europe to deport to the Soviet Union millions of former residents of the USSR (some of whom [[Collaboration during World War II|collaborated with the Germans]]), including numerous persons who had left Russia and established different citizenship many years before. The forced repatriation operations took place from 1945–1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis/archive/issue.asp?year=1988&amp;month=12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207142426/http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis/archive/issue.asp?year=1988&amp;month=12|date=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of World War II, more than 5 million "[[displaced person]]s" from the Soviet Union survived in German captivity. About 3 million had been [[Unfree labour|forced laborers]] (Ostarbeiter)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers &amp;#124; Germany &amp;#124; DW.DE &amp;#124; 27.10.2005 |publisher=Dw-world.de |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany and occupied territories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809030800/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html|date=9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectinghistory.net/ostarbeiter/index.html |title=The Nazi Ostarbeiter (Eastern Worker) Program |publisher=Collectinghistory.net |date=1922-06-26 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving POWs, about 1.5 million, repatriated ''[[Ostarbeiter]]'', and other displaced persons, totally  more than 4,000,000 people were sent to special [[NKVD filtration camp]]s (not [[Gulag]]). By 1946, 80% civilians and 20% of PoWs were freed, 5% of civilians, and 43% of PoWs re-drafted, 10% of civilians and 22% of PoWs were sent to labor battalions, and 2% of civilians and 15% of the PoWs (226,127 out of 1,539,475 total) transferred to the NKVD, i.e. the Gulag.&lt;ref&gt;("Военно-исторический журнал" ("Military-Historical Magazine"), 1997, №5. page 32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Земское В.Н. К вопросу о репатриации советских граждан. 1944–1951 годы // История СССР. 1990. № 4 (Zemskov V.N. On repatriation of Soviet citizens). Istoriya SSSR., 1990, No.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==
Many historians {{who|date=November 2018}} consider these mass deportations of civilians a [[crime against humanity]]. Terry Martin of [[Harvard University]] observes:
{{quote2|...the same principles that informed Soviet [[nation building]] could and did lead to [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[Ethnic persecution|ethnic terror]] against a limited set of stigmatized nationalities, while leaving nation-building policies in place for the majority of nonstigmatized nationalities.{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=816–817}}}}

==Death toll==
The number of deaths attributed to deported people living in exile is considerable. The causes for such demographic catastrophe lie in harsh climates of Siberia and Kazakhstan, disease, [[malnutrition]], [[Exploitation of labour|work exploitation]] which lasted for up to 10 hours daily as well as any kind of appropriate housing or accommodation for the deported people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13416">{{Sri Lankan Tamil history}}
The '''Sinhala Only Act''', formally the '''Official Language Act No. 33 of 1956''', was an act passed in the [[Parliament of Ceylon]] in 1956.&lt;ref name="Consolidated Acts"&gt;[http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/num_act/ola33o1956180/ Sri Lanka Consolidated Acts]&lt;/ref&gt; The act replaced [[English language|English]] as the [[official language]] of Ceylon with [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]].&lt;ref name="Consolidated Acts"/&gt; The act failed to give official recognition to [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which had not received official recognition before.{{what|date=February 2018}}

Sinhalese is the language of [[Sri Lanka]]'s majority [[Sinhalese people]], who accounted for around 70% of the country's population at that time.&lt;ref name=stats&gt;{{cite web|title=Population by ethnic group, census years|url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/abstract2010/chapters/Chap2/AB2-10.pdf|work=Statistical Abstract 2010|publisher=Department of Census &amp; Statistics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113175023/http://www.statistics.gov.lk/abstract2010/chapters/Chap2/AB2-10.pdf|archivedate=13 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamil is the [[first language]] of Ceylon's three largest minority ethnic groups, the [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]], [[Sri Lankan Tamils]] and [[Sri Lankan Moors|Moors]], who together accounted for around 29% of the country's population.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

The act was controversial as supporters of the act saw it as an attempt by a community that had just gained independence to distance themselves from their colonial masters, while its opponents viewed it as an attempt by the linguistic majority to oppress and assert dominance on minorities. The Act symbolizes the post independent majority Sinhalese to assert its Sri Lanka's identity as a nation state, and for Tamils, it became a symbol of minority oppression and a justification for them to demand a separate nation-state, [[Tamil Eelam]], which was a factor in the emergence of the decades-long [[Sri Lankan Civil War]].

==British rule==
Under the [[British Empire]], English was the language of rule in Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka). Until the passage of the ''Free Education Bill'' in 1944, education in the English language was the preserve of the subaltern elite and the ordinary people had little knowledge of it. A disproportionate number of English-language schools were located in the mostly Tamil-speaking north. Thus, English-speaking Tamils held a higher percentage of coveted [[Ceylon Civil Service]] jobs, which required English fluency, than their share of the island's population.{{Citation needed|date= December 2011}}

After their [[Ceylonese State Council election, 1936|election]] to the [[State Council of Ceylon]] in 1936, the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] (LSSP) members [[N. M. Perera]] and [[Philip Gunawardena]] demanded the replacement of English as the official language by Sinhala and Tamil. In November 1936, a motion that "in the Municipal and Police Courts of the Island the proceedings should be in the [[vernacular]]" and that "entries in police stations should be recorded in the language in which they are originally stated" were passed by the State Council and referred to the [[legal secretary]].{{Citation needed|date= December 2011}}

In 1944, [[J. R. Jayewardene]] moved a motion in the State Council that Sinhala should replace English as the official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mr.J.R.Jayawardene on 'Sinhala Only and Tamil Also' in the Ceylon State Council|url=http://www.tamilnation.co/indictment/indict004.htm#Mr.J.R.Jayawardene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, nothing was done about these matters and English continued to be the language of rule until 1956.{{Citation needed|date= December 2011}}

==Ceylon after independence==
Ceylon gained [[dominion]] status in 1948 with a [[Sri Lankan independence movement|peaceful struggle]], the passage to sovereignty from the British to the Sri Lankan [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] elite being a peaceful one. For the first years of independence, there was an attempt to balance the interests of the elites of the main communities: the Sinhalese and the Tamils.{{Citation needed|date= December 2011}} Most Sinhalese did, however, harbour the view that the Tamils had enjoyed a privileged position under the British. Some have described this being mainly due to the British policy of "[[divide and rule]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Britain is failing Sri Lanka's Muslims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/sep/01/post331| work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Farah | last=Mihlar | date=1 September 2006 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, at the behest of the foreign plantation owners, the government [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] the Indian Tamil plantation workers, who accounted for 12% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Missed Opportunities and the Loss of Democracy|url=http://www.uthr.org/BP/volume1/Chapter1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Plantation Tamils deprived of vote and citizenship, 1948/50|url=http://www.tamilnation.co/indictment/indict001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the ambitious [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike|Solomon Bandaranaike]] broke with his party, the conservative [[United National Party]] (UNP), and created a new centrist party, the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]] (SLFP). In 1955, the SLFP decided to break ranks with the general consensus on the left to have both Sinhalese and Tamil as official languages to campaign on the slogan "Sinhala Only".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Brown, Michael Edward|author2=Ganguly, Sumit|title=Fighting Words: Language Policy and Ethnic Relations in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcoDezu1ABoC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=1955+Sinhala+only&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7jF0UVXQ2A&amp;sig=U-EblNVrcJJHu6OU6E0EzscCVoI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK3r6IrvrUAhWGFT4KHXX_CB8Q6AEIRDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=1955%20Sinhala%20only&amp;f=false|website=Google Books|publisher=MIT Press 2003|accessdate=8 July 2017|page=119|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enactment==
In the 1956 parliamentary elections, the SLFP campaigned on largely nationalist policies, and made the one of their key election promises. The result was electoral victory for the SLFP, and ''The Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council'' or ''Sinhala Only Bill'' was quickly enacted after the election. The bill was passed with the SLFP and the UNP supporting it, with the leftist LSSP and [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka]] as well as the [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Tamil nationalist]] parties ([[Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi]] and [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress]]) opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;De Silva, K. M., &amp; Wriggins, W. H. (1988). J. R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka: a political biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tamil and Sinhalese opposition to the Act==
[[Left-wing politics|The Left]] bitterly opposed it, with Dr N. M. Perera, leader of the LSSP, moving a motion in Parliament that the Act "should be amended forthwith to provide for the Sinhalese and Tamil languages to be state languages of Ceylon with parity of status throughout the Island."{{Citation needed|date= December 2011}}

Dr [[Colvin R. de Silva]] of the LSSP responded, in what some regard as famous last words: "Do we... want a single nation or do we want two nations? Do we want a single state or do we want two? Do we want one Ceylon or do we want two? And above all, do we want an independent Ceylon which must necessarily be united and single and single Ceylon, or two bleeding halves of Ceylon which can be gobbled up by every ravaging imperialist monster that may happen to range the Indian ocean? These are issues that in fact we have been discussing under the form and appearance of language issue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2017/11/15/features/134500/colvin-%E2%80%94-trotskyite-humanist-and-wittiest COLVIN — TROTSKYITE, HUMANIST AND THE WITTIEST] Daily News Lanka - November 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the act was met with demonstrations from Tamils led by the [[Federal Party (Sri Lanka)|Federal Party]] who organized a [[satyagraha]] (peaceful protest) outside the parliament building. As a response, the Sinhalese nationalist group Eksath Bhikkhu Peramuna organized a counter-protest and a mob representing this group attacked the Tamil protesters and was "responsible for unleashing riots that killed nearly 150 Tamils."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcoDezu1ABoC&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Fighting Words: Language Policy and Ethnic Relations in Asia|last=|first=|date=2003-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262523332|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Michael Edward|page=124|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial reversal in 1958==
Parts of the act was reversed in 1958, after the so-called "Sinhala Only, Tamil Also" compromise made by the Tamil leaders. On 3 September 1958 the ''Tamil Language (Special Provisions) Act'' - which provided for the use of the Tamil language as a medium of instruction, as a medium of examination for admission to the Public Service, for use in state correspondence and for administrative purposes in the [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|Northern]] and [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern provinces]] - was passed.&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Ghosh, 'Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and role of Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF)', APH Publishing, 1999; {{ISBN|81-7648-107-6}}, {{ISBN|978-81-7648-107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Left parties continued to demand parity of status until after the Tamil electorate voted overwhelmingly in the 1960 elections for the same leaders who had agreed to the compromise.

==Effect==
The policy turned out to be "severely discriminatory" and placed the Tamil-speaking population at a "serious disadvantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjF-AgAAQBAJ|title=Buddhism, Conflict and Violence in Modern Sri Lanka|last=Deegalle|first=Mahinda|date=2006-09-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134241880|editor-last=Deegalle|editor-first=Mahinda|page=183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Sinhalese academic A. M. Navaratna Bandara writes: "The Tamil-speaking people were given no option but to learn the language of the majority if they wanted to get public service employment. [...] A large number of Tamil public servants had to accept compulsory retirement because of their inability to prove proficiency in the official language [...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iudi2JJLaUAC&amp;pg=PA63|title=Sri Lanka: Current Issues and Historical Background|last=|first=|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=9781590335734|editor-last=Nubin|editor-first=Walter|page=63|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of these policies were dramatic as shown by the drastic drop of Tamil representation in public sector: "In 1956, 30 percent of the Ceylon administrative service, 50 percent of the clerical service, 60 percent of engineers and doctors, and 40 percent of the armed forces were Tamil. By 1970 those numbers had plummeted to 5 percent, 5 percent, 10 percent, and 1 percent, respectively."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcoDezu1ABoC&amp;pg=PA129#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Fighting Words: Language Policy and Ethnic Relations in Asia|last=|first=|date=2003-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262523332|editor-last=Brown|editor-first=Michael Edward|page=129|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the 1960s government forms and services were virtually unavailable to Tamils, and this situation only partly improved with later relaxations of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terminategenocide.com/html/sinhala_only_act.html Terminate Genocide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages today==
According to Chapter IV of the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka]], the Sinhala and Tamil languages are both official and national languages of the country. This constitution was amended in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/AMENDMENTS.html THE CONSTITUTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817113810/http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/AMENDMENTS.html |date=17 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapter_04"&gt;[http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Chapter_04_Amd.html THE CONSTITUTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA, CHAPTER IV - LANGUAGE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030203101808/http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Chapter_04_Amd.html |date=3 February 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20030203101808/http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Chapter_04_Amd.html Chapter 4: Language of Legislation] of the Sri Lanka constitution, previously written act is to be interpreted in Sinhala to avoid mis-interpretation. In the case of a new act the [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|parliament]], at the stage of enactment has the authority to determine which version of the legislation prevails in the event of inconsistencies.&lt;ref name="Chapter_04"/&gt;

The '''Strawberry Fields Festival''' was a [[rock music]] festival held at [[Mosport International Raceway|Mosport Park]] Raceway in [[Bowmanville, Ontario]], Canada, about 100 kilometers east of [[Toronto]], between August 7 and the early morning hours of August 10, 1970.   Although accounts vary, the audience has been estimated at between 75,000 and 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

=== Connection to Toronto Peace Festival ===
John Brower along with [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] had originally planned to host the "Toronto Peace Festival" at Mosport Park in July 1970 but they ran into numerous roadblocks and their plans were dashed when their application for the necessary permits were denied. In de-classified documents released in 2007 it was revealed in an RCMP report dated December 30, 1969, that the Canadian security service began spying on ex-Beatle John and Yoko after they announced their plans for the Peace Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/07/23/lennon-rcmp.html| title= RCMP spied on Lennon, Ono: declassified files | work=CBC News | date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selection of the venue and promotion ===
Without John and Yoko, Brower moved forward with plans to host a festival at Shediac, near [[Moncton]], New Brunswick, named the "Strawberry Fields Festival".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Kelley, [https://musicnerd.ca/why-did-new-brunswick-pull-the-plug-on-an-epic-rock-concert-in-august-1970/ Why Did New Brunswick Pull The Plug On An Epic Rock Concert In August 1970?], Music Nerd,  August 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Again, local politicians intervened and revoked various permits so Brower shifted the location back to Mosport Park in Ontario only this time he thinly disguised the event as a championship motorcycle race featuring "some contemporary entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;

  | accessdate = &lt;!-----8 October 2009-----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The festival was advertised in Canada as the "First Annual Strawberry Cup Trophy Race".   To avoid public and political scrutiny, the musical entertainment aspect of the event was downplayed in advertisements and the festival was not promoted heavily in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was discovered that the primary focus of the event was not motor cycle racing but instead a rock music festival, the Attorney General of Ontario, Arthur Wishart, filed for an injunction to stop the festival from taking place citing health and public safety concerns.  On August 6, with only hours to go before the opening act was scheduled to take the stage, Supreme Court Justice D. A. Keith refused to grant the injunction and the festival was allowed to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in Canada, the "Strawberry Fields Festival" was promoted heavily in the U.S. as a three-day rock music festival with the slogan, "Love, Sun and Sound". As a result, a large percentage of the attendees were from the American north east. Others travelled from as far away as California and Florida.  In the end, the sanctioning body for the racing series withdrew its drivers from the event so an actual race never occurred although an obligatory lap by a few motorcyclists did occur in order to comply with the local ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border troubles ===
Several thousand more young American music fans were turned back at the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] by Canadian border agents. The fans were unable to provide proof they had sufficient funds to look after themselves while visiting Canada or produce adequate identification. Forty US dollars were required to be shown to officials (at the Thousand Islands Bridge crossing checkpoint). If one could not show cash they were told they could not enter Canada. Cash was sometimes borrowed from person to person at the lineup. One person turned away at the Canadian border crossing at [[Prescott, Ontario]], drowned while attempting to swim into Canada across the [[St. Lawrence River]] near [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown]], New York.  Several arrests related to the attempted importation of narcotics and banned substances were made.&lt;ref&gt;

=== The park ===
Mosport is a {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} auto racing venue. Strawberry Fields was the first of three major music festivals held at [[Mosport Park]] Raceway, between 1970 and 1980. The other two were [[Canada Jam]] held August 26, 1978 and the [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] themed [[Heatwave (festival)|Heatwave Festival]] held August 23, 1980.

[[Chip Monck]], who designed the stage lighting for Woodstock and became the impromptu emcee of that event, had planned to emcee Strawberry Fields, but the various changes in dates and venues pushed the festival into August and Monck was bound to honour a previous commitment to work the [[Rolling Stones]] European tour at that time.

'''Tbilisoba''' ({{lang-ka|თბილისობა}}) is an annual October festival which celebrates the diversity and history of [[Tbilisi]], the capital of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. It was first held on October 28, 1979, and has since become an established tradition. The festival features [[open-air concert]]s of traditional music and dancing and various cultural events, centered on [[Old Tbilisi]], the historical part of the city. Beyond celebrating the city's past and present, people from all over Georgia represent their region at the fair of the harvest and ''[[Rtveli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120805163154/http://www.tbilisi.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=3515 Tbilisoba].

''Georgian Journal''. 11 October, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was created at the initiative of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], then the First Secretary of the [[Georgian Communist Party|Communist Party]] of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]], to honor the capital and counter attendance at religious events as part of his program to overcome "manifestations of nationalism" through introducing new "socialist traditions". The event became a celebration of the city's 1,500-year history and had the unintended effect of engaging Georgians more intensely in their national history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen F. Jones|Jones, Stephen F.]], "Old Ghosts and New Chains: Ethnicity and Memory in the Georgian Republic", p. 160. Watson, Rubie (ed., 1999), ''Memory, History and Opposition Under State Socialism''. School of American Research Press, Santa Fe, {{ISBN|0-933452-86-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival remained dormant during the civil unrest of the early 1990s. It was resumed in 1995 and has since been held annually, usually in the latter half of October.

'''Tendonectomy''' is the surgical cutting of [[tendon]]s, and is generally only practiced in veterinary medicine.

== In cats ==

Performing a tendonectomy on a [[cat]] is an alternative to [[onychectomy]] ("declawing"), which amputates the end of each digit. Tendonectomy may be considered less painful for the cat than onychectomy; however, it is not recommended by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA) and is illegal in many countries.

In a tendonectomy, a small portion of the tendon in each of a cat's toes is surgically removed to prevent the cat from extending the claws. Thus, the cat is no longer capable of scratching.

Claws will continue to grow following tendonectomy, and because the cat can no longer extend the claws to scratch, the cat will not wear down the claws as before. Therefore, among other considerations, the cat owner should evaluate the ongoing maintenance required in the form of regular claw trimming thereafter when considering this procedure.

In terms of studies on the impact of onychectomy versus tendonectomy, the American Veterinary Medical Association compared the outcomes of the two operations in its August 1, 1998 issue.  Their report considered owner satisfaction and drawbacks such as pain and future complications.  Cats who underwent tendonectomy displayed significantly lower pain immediately following the procedure versus those who underwent onychectomy.  However, both procedures showed an equal frequency of other complications, such as bleeding, lameness, and infection.  Cats took the same number of days to recover from both operations (as measured by normalcy in walking), and owners were equally satisfied with both options.

One complication to watch out for later on in the cat's life with a tendonectomy is the nails getting brittle. Nails that are more brittle are prone to splitting and shattering when trimmed by the owner, which is quite painful for the cat.

'''''The Farnsworth Invention''''' is a [[stage play]] by [[Aaron Sorkin]] adapted from an unproduced [[screenplay]] about [[Philo Farnsworth]]'s first fully functional and completely all-electronic [[television]] system and [[David Sarnoff]], the [[RCA]] president who stole the design.

== Screenplay ==

On April 29, 2004, [[New Line Cinema]] announced they had acquired the drama script ''The Farnsworth Invention'' from award-winning writer Aaron Sorkin. [[Thomas Schlamme]] was set to direct.

The release read in part: "''The Farnsworth Invention'' tells the story of [[Philo Farnsworth]], a boy genius born in Beaver, Utah, who later moved to Rigby, Idaho, where he began experimenting with electricity. In 1920, when Farnsworth was 14, he showed his high school chemistry teacher a design he had made for an electronic television only to become involved in an all or nothing battle with [[David Sarnoff]], the young president of [[RCA]] and [[United States|America]]'s first communications mogul." Schlamme described the movie as "a classic American tale driven by the conflict between a [[Mormon]] farmer and a [[Russia]]n immigrant over the ownership of the most influential invention of the 20th Century."

Following its initial press release, New Line did not disclose any additional information about the film. As a result, [[website]]s such as the [[The Internet Movie Database|Internet Movie Database]] incorrectly anticipated a film in 2005. IMDb eventually removed the entry.

== Stage play ==

In 2005 it was announced that Sorkin was adapting the screenplay for the stage and the play would debut in the [[Abbey Theatre]] in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. It was staged at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] from February 20 - March 25, 2007 as "a page-to-stage production" with [[Jimmi Simpson]] (''[[Zodiac (2007 film)|Zodiac]]'') playing Farnsworth and [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]] (''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'') as Sarnoff. Award-winning composer [[Andrew Lippa]] penned 45 minutes of music to underscore the drama.

It was scheduled to open on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on November 14, 2007, but this was delayed due to the [[2007 Broadway stagehand strike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/109037.html Aaron Sorkin's Farnsworth Invention to Open on Broadway in November] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626121651/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/109037.html |date=2007-06-26 }}&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Playbill]]'' Article, June 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  It opened at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on December 3, 2007, with [[Hank Azaria]] in the Sarnoff role due to Lang's commitment to [[James Cameron]]'s 2009 film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.

The show closed on March 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farnsworthonbroadway.com/ |title=Official Show Website |publisher=Farnsworthonbroadway.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian production directed by Louise Fischer officially opened on July 13, 2011 at the [[New Theatre (Newtown)|New Theatre]] in [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]].

== Historical accuracy ==

The play is not historically accurate, and is an intentional alteration of the story. It shows Farnsworth as being defeated legally by Sarnoff, and then spending his life in obscurity. In reality, Farnsworth won the lawsuit, later received a $1 million payment from RCA for the purchase of his TV patents, and went on to have an illustrious career in technological research. There is a statue of Farnsworth in [[Statuary Hall]] in the [[U.S. Capitol]].

This issue was later addressed on a Facebook question where Sorkin wrote:
{{cquote|There were many lawsuits, appeals and counter-suits that covered years. Farnsworth won some of them and lost some of them. The final result—certainly in the context of the play I'd written—was a loss. Farnsworth died, as Sarnoff says at the end, "drunk, broke and in obscurity" and whether or not it was the result of corporate espionage or theft was the subject of the play. That's a long of way of saying I conflated many lawsuits into one.&lt;ref&gt;Sorkin, Aaron. "Questions for me?" Message Board on Sorkin's [[Facebook]] page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;—Aaron Sorkin}}

== Critical reception ==

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Ben Brantley]] [[Damn with faint praise|panned the play with faint praise]]:
{{cquote|The show certainly deserves high marks for all those traits that exacting schoolteachers hold dear: conciseness, legibility, correct use of [[topic sentence]]s, evidence in defense of two sides of an argument and colorful examples to support the main thesis ....  And yet you’re likely to leave “The Farnsworth Invention” feeling that you have just watched an animated Wikipedia entry, fleshed out with the sort of anecdotal scenes that figure in “re-enactments” on E! channel documentaries and true-crime shows.&lt;ref name="NYT review"&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/theater/reviews/04farn.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=david%20sarnoff&amp;st=nyt&amp;scp=2 Brantley, Ben. "A Farm Boy and a Mogul, and How They Changed the World,"] ''New York Times.'' December 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''[[New York Post]]'', [[Clive Barnes (critic)|Clive Barnes]] awarded it 2½ out of 4 stars and stated, "Sorkin's take on the Farnsworth/Sarnoff standoff would be better suited to a screen, either big or small. Even now, while crackling with crisp dialogue, ''The Farnsworth Invention'' often has the air of a clumsy stage adaptation of, say, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes |first=Clive |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12042007/entertainment/theater/back_to_bway_with_made_for_tv_tale_502570.htm |title='&amp;#39;New York Post'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Dziemianowicz of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' described it as "disappointing and ho-hum" and "seldom deeply involving . . . Scenes play out like brief [[vignette (literature)|vignette]]s from a [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] biopic  . . . without stirring emotions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2007/12/04/2007-12-04_tale_of_tv_in_farnsworth_invention_goes_.html |title='&amp;#39;New York Daily News'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Newsday]]'', Linda Winer called it "vintage Sorkin and crackling prime-time theater . . . breezy and shrewd, smart-alecky and idealistic." &lt;ref name="Newsday Review"&gt;{{cite news|first=Linda|last=Winer|title=Review: Aaron Sorkin's "The Farnsworth Invention|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/stage/ny-secsingdec04,0,3986500.story|publisher=[[Newsday]]|date=December 4, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071207175542/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/stage/ny-secsingdec04,0,3986500.story &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', David Rooney said, "The plot-heavy drama is light on fully fleshed-out characters or subtext, making it likely to play more satisfyingly when it inevitably reverts to being a film or [[cable television|cable]] project . . . [it] never fully moves beyond its stream of over-explained factoids." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935557.html?categoryid=33&amp;cs=1 |title='&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Variety.com |date= December 3, 2007|accessdate=2009-09-15 |first=David |last=Rooney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Hedy Weiss described it as "a firecracker of a play in a fittingly snap, crackle and pop production under the direction of Des McAnuff, the drama has among its many virtues the ability to make you think at the same time that it breaks your heart."  &lt;ref name="Chicago Sun-Times Review"&gt;{{cite news|first=Hedy|last=Weiss|title=Moguls, Scientists, and 'Farnsworth'|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/weiss/679274,CST-FTR-farn04web.article|publisher=[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=December 4, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Jones of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called it "slick yet deeply conflicted" and "restless" and added, "this is one of those Boomer-friendly, media-savvy, self-aware pieces of effective theater that feel like they owe a lot to TV writing and our celebrity-obsessed culture . . . this is a jumpy piece of writing. It feels like the writer is worried the audience might change the channel. That's not entirely a bad thing. As fans of Sorkin's TV shows know well, the internal psyche of Sorkin is a very stimulating place in which to dwell for a couple of hours. His characters are uncommonly articulate and witty—albeit without much differentiation. He has mastered all the dramatic rules so well, he can titillate you by deconstructing and then reassembling them. And in this case he certainly knows how to make a dry scientific quest into a provocative piece of theater." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-sorkin_onlinedec06,1,6902398.story |title='&amp;#39;Chicago Tribune'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=2007-12-06 |accessdate=2009-09-15 | first=Chris | last=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piccadilly Station Manchester - geograph.org.uk - 692981.jpg|thumb|Warehouse Project events have been held underneath Piccadilly station (Store Street) since 2014, and were also previously held here from 2007 to 2011.]]

'''The Warehouse Project''' is a series of club nights organised in [[Greater Manchester]], England, since 2006. Unlike most other clubs, it has a limited seasonal approach rather than running all year. Each year's season runs from September through to New Years Day, plus occasional one off dates such as Bank Holiday weekends. This period corresponds with the busiest time of the year and the student calendar.&lt;ref name="enforbusiness1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enforbusiness.com/interview/five-minutes-sacha-lord-marchionne-and-sam-kandel-founders-warehouse-project |title=Five minutes with... Sacha Lord-Marchionne and Sam Kandel, founders of the Warehouse Project &amp;#124; Interview |publisher=EN for Business |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Warehouse Project was initially started as a joint venture by Sacha Lord-Marchionne and Sam Kandel, who both had previous involvement with the [[Sankeys (nightclub)|Sankeys]] nightclub in Manchester.&lt;ref name="enforbusiness1"/&gt; It began operations in the disused [[Strangeways Brewery|Boddingtons Brewery]] in [[Strangeways]], and then moved into a space under [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly station]], on Store Street, which previously served as an air raid shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djmag.com/news/detail/921 |title=The Warehouse Project |publisher=djmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2011, The Warehouse Project announced that the 2011 season would be the last ever WHP event at Store Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skiddle.com/groups/whp/news/9668.html |title=Latest News: Composit Music |publisher=Skiddle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a later announcement on 22 March 2012 that the 2012 season would be based at the Victoria Warehouse Hotel, to the west of [[Manchester city centre]] in [[Trafford Park]], near [[Old Trafford]] football stadium. The club remained at this location for the 2013 season as well. In late 2013, rumours started that The Warehouse Project was due to move to the disused [[Manchester Mayfield railway station|Mayfield Depot]] next to Manchester Piccadilly station from 2014 but a planning application was subsequently withdrawn in September 2013. The Warehouse Project's 2013 season drew to a close at the end of the year, with a final closing party on 1 January 2014 at the Victoria Warehouse Hotel venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchester Mayfield railway station |url=http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/News/Warehouse-Project-Coming-Back-To-City-Centre-Manchester-Mayfield-Depot |work=Manchester Confidential |date=28 August 2013 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the announcement made in 2011, the 2014 season returned to Store Street, in a move being described by the organisers as returning to their "spiritual home" for one last year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/warehouse-project-announces-2014-season-7250904 |title=Warehouse Project announces 2014 season launch party |publisher=manchestereveningnews.co.uk |date=2014-06-11 |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the owners of Mayfield Depot decided to redevelop their site rather than retaining it as a cultural venue.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Warehouse Project plans to move into Mayfield Depot scrapped after owners pull out |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/warehouse-project-mayfield-depot-nightclub-7561930 |work=Manchester Evening News |date=6 August 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the 2015 season will again be located at the Store Street location.

The 2017 season was announced in July 2017, with 31 shows returning to Store Street once again from September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skiddle.com/news/all/The-Warehouse-Project-2017-line-up-announced/31913/ |title=The Warehouse Project 2017 Lineups Announced}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and artists==

Since its foundation the club has played host to numerous internationally acclaimed DJs such as [[Carl Cox]], [[Sven Väth]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Richie Hawtin]], [[Deadmau5]], [[Annie Mac]], [[Pete Tong]], [[Armand Van Helden]] and [[Erick Morillo]], and musicians such as [[De La Soul]], [[Happy Mondays]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], [[The Prodigy]], [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]], [[Basement Jaxx]] and [[Foals (band)|Foals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4clubbers.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1436 |title=Topic: News In Efficient Options For Garcinia Extract |publisher=4clubbers |date=2012-11-12 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, The Warehouse Project was voted by dance music magazine ''[[Mixmag]]'' as the best club in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vivalifestyle.co.uk/148/ |title=Manchester's most influential club in the last five years: The Warehouse Project |publisher=Viva Lifestyle |date=2012 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 The Warehouse Project was voted by ''DJ mag'' as the ''Best Club Series'' in the magazines ''Best of British Awards''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djmag.com/content/best-club-series-warehouse-project |title=Best club series: The Warehouse Project |date=2013 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warehouse Project is noted for placing international DJs alongside less established artists.

==Fatalities==

Two high-profile deaths have occurred at The Warehouse Project, those of Nick Bonnie and Souvik Pal, alongside several reports in the media of near-misses.&lt;ref name="menarticle2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/suspected-drug-dealer-critically-ill-6110301 |title=Suspected drug dealer critically ill after swallowing drugs at Warehouse Project |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="menarticle4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/warehouse-project-clubber-hospitalised-after-6150668 |title=Woman hospitalised after taking drugs at Warehouse Project comes out of coma |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents resulted in calls from local councillors such as David Acton and Mike Cordingley for the licence to be revoked or reviewed.&lt;ref name="menarticle5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/revealed-shocking-full-toll-drug-6118379 |title=Warehouse Project: Revealed, shocking full toll of drug horror at death club |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, police statements have countered this, with high-ranking officers supporting the club and is management.&lt;ref name="menarticle6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/warehouse-project-tragedy-man-gloucestershire-6108246 |title=Warehouse Project tragedy: Man from Gloucestershire dies and five others hospitalised after taking ecstasy |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen individuals were hospitalised during the first weekend of the 2013 season from taking drugs at the venue,&lt;ref name="menarticle5"/&gt; and also include drug dealers at the club who have attempted to avoid arrest by swallowing all their stash.&lt;ref name="menarticle2"/&gt;

===Souvik Pal===

At the end of the 2012 season, on New Year's Eve, Souvik Pal was escorted out of the club.&lt;ref name="guardian9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/08/missing-manchester-student-father |title=Missing Manchester students father arrives in UK from India to help search |publisher=The Guardian |date=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently found dead in the adjacent canal later that month.&lt;ref name="menarticle3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mystery-man-bridge-hold-clue-6257710 |title=Mystery man on bridge may hold clue over death of Warehouse Project clubber |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="menarticle8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/indian-student-souvik-pals-body-1235671 |title=Souvik Pals body found in canal near spot where he disappeared |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexplained death was later reclassified as a murder investigation after reports of Souvik being seen leaving the area with an unknown individual after being thrown out of the club.&lt;ref name="menarticle3"/&gt; Although the death did not occur on the premises of the club, local councilors questioned whether the security at the club was sufficient.&lt;ref name="guardian9"/&gt;

===Nick Bonnie===

On the very first night of the 2013 season, a group of friends from [[Gloucestershire]] attended the opening event at The Warehouse Project.&lt;ref name="menarticle6"/&gt; During the course of the night, one of their party fell ill and had to be taken to hospital, where he later died due to an overdose of an illegal drug he had consumed at The Warehouse Project. Initially, it was believed that Nick had purchased the drug inside club from a dealer, largely due to testimony of his friends, and this led to police and media fears of a "bad" batch of [[MDMA|ecstasy]], possibly laced with [[Para-Methoxyamphetamine|PMA]].&lt;ref name="menarticle5"/&gt; However, in subsequent court proceedings, the friends admitted to having invented this story to cover that they had brought the drug into the club themselves.&lt;ref name="menarticle1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/pals-warehouse-project-drug-death-clubber-7968116 |title=Pals of Warehouse Project drug-death clubber Nick Bonnie walk free after admitting lies over tragedy |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2014-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall out from the death led to further calls for the club's license to be reviewed,&lt;ref name="menarticle5"/&gt; and in the following days further hospital statements contributed to media reporting that the club itself had become an unacceptable risk.&lt;ref name="menarticle7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/revealed-shocking-full-toll-drug-6118379 |title=Hospital staff left in tears by spate of bad ecstasy victims |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club responded to this by increasing in the number of medical and security staff at the venue.&lt;ref name="menarticle4"/&gt; Various national politicians, including the Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], commented on the incident and the dangers posed by people taking illegal drugs at clubs such as The Warehouse Project, calling it a tragic death.&lt;ref name="itv10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-09-30/david-cameron-charity-workers-death-is-tragic/ |title=Charity workers drugs death |publisher=ITV |date=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19759">The '''US raid on the Iranian Liaison Office in Erbil''' refers to the events of 11 January 2007 when the [[Military of the United States|US military]] raided the [[Iran]]ian Liaison Office (which was in the process of becoming accredited as an officially recognized [[consulate]])&lt;ref name=iran-20070119&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/Iran%20S200728.pdf|title=Letter dated 19 January 2007 from the Chargé d’affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General|date=22 January 2007|publisher=[[United Nations]]|id=A/61/706–S/2007/28|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Erbil]], [[Iraq]], ostensibly to detain two senior Iranian officials but capturing five mid-level diplomats instead.&lt;ref name=WP-20070621&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/20/AR2007062001456.html|title=U.S. Refuses to Free 5 Captured Iranians Until at Least October|author=Robin Wright|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=June 21, 2007|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent-20070403 /&gt; The [[US government]]'s position is that the office was used by the Iranian [[Revolutionary Guards]] as a local headquarters.

On July 9, 2009, US authorities released the five diplomats (Mohsen Bagheri, Mahmoud Farhadi, Majid Ghaemi, Majid Dagheri and Abbas Jami), after more than two and a half years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/07/09/iraq.iranians.released/index.html|title=Iranians held in Iraq since 2007 released |publisher=CNN |accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US said this action was required under the [[U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-07-09-voa52.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717220255/http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-07-09-voa52.cfm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 July 2009|title=US: Iranian Prisoner Release Not a Gesture to Tehran|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The raid==
According to [[Iran]]ian officials, five U.S. helicopters landed on the roof of the liaison office in Arbil. U.S. soldiers entered the building, detained five people and took away materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.co.nz/main/viewstory.aspx?storyid=354288&amp;catid=0|title=Page not found - NewsWire.co.nz|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2017}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The raid occurred between 3 and 5 a.m., when the U.S. troops entered the liaison office after disarming the guards.&lt;ref name=WP-20070112 /&gt; Two senior local Kurdish officials said the forces confiscated computers and documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkdispatch.com/nationworld/ci_4992823|title=Iraqi officials say multinational forces detained Iranian staffers from Tehran's consulate|work=York Dispatch|accessdate=15 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205103252/http://www.yorkdispatch.com/nationworld/ci_4992823|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report which was later confirmed by [[Massoud Barzani]], the President of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]],&lt;ref name="w3123"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6538988,00.html Kurd: U.S. Sought Other Iranians in Raid], ''[[The Guardian]]'', April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' noted that instead of the current captives, the U.S. had hoped to capture the deputy head of the Iranian [[Supreme National Security Council]], Mohammed Jafari, and chief of intelligence of the IRGC, General Manuchehr Frouzandeh, who were on an official visit to Iraq ostensibly to improve co-operation in the area of bilateral security, during which they met the [[Iraqi President]] [[Jalal Talabani]]. Barzani stated: "They (the commanders) came here and they came openly. Their meetings with the president and myself were reported on television. The Americans came to detain this delegation, not the people in the office. They came to the wrong place at the wrong time."&lt;ref name=Independent-20070403 /&gt;&lt;ref name=IHT-20070406 /&gt; It was also reported that U.S. troops attempted to detain people at the [[Arbil International Airport|Arbil airport]] that same day, but Kurdish forces intervened. Iraqi Foreign Minister [[Hoshyar Zebari]] said that there was almost a confrontation between U.S. and Kurdish troops at the airport but that "a massacre was avoided at the last minute."&lt;ref name=WP-20070112 /&gt;

The raid took place within hours of [[U.S. President]] [[George W.

This was not the first time the United States had arrested alleged [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|IRGC]] members in Iraq. A few weeks before, on 29 December, U.S. forces in Iraq released alleged Iranian IRGC members who were detained for alleged weapons smuggling after a raid conducted 21 December in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiadaily.com/breaking_news/84145.asp IndiaDaily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518203655/http://www.indiadaily.com/breaking_news/84145.asp |date=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-20061229&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6216455.stm|title=US frees detained Iran diplomats|date=29 December 2006|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of office==
The Iranian liaison office in Arbil has been active and operating since 1992. The various governments dispute the exact status of the office.

According to Iraqi Foreign Minister [[Hoshyar Zebari]], the detained Iranians had been working in Arbil with official sanction, and the liaison office was in the process of becoming a full consulate; however the office was yet to be classified as a consulate with diplomatic protection.&lt;ref name=khaleej-20070125&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2007/January/middleeast_January262.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=|work=Khaleej Times Online|agency=AFP|title=US says its has proof Iran is interfering in Iraq|date=25 January 2007|accessdate=2008-05-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201130210/http://khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2007%2FJanuary%2Fmiddleeast_January262.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=|archivedate=1 December 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1247222,00.html|title=Arrests 'Violated Law'|date=January 12, 2007|publisher=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran states that based on an agreement between the Governments of Iran and Iraq its status was officially changed to a [[Consulate General]], and official ''note verbale'' (diplomatic notes) were exchanged between the two countries accordingly.&lt;ref name=iran-20070119 /&gt; According to the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]] consulates enjoy immunity and all members of the U.N. have to respect such immunity.

Officials of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] said that consular activities, such as the issuance of visas, had been carried out by the office staff since 1992, and they were treated as if they were accredited diplomats.&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes-20070331&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IC31Ak04.html US silent on detained Iranians], [[Asia Times]], 31 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. State Department]] spokesman [[Sean McCormack]] said the detainees were not diplomats.&lt;ref name=khaleej-20070125 /&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Masoud Barzani]] condemned the capture and demanded the quick release of Iranians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baztab.ir/news/57601.php|title=بارزاني و دستور محاصره نظاميان آمريكا براي آزادي سريع ديپلمات‌هاي ايران&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029171037/http://www.baztab.ir/news/57601.php|archivedate=29 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6338889,00.html | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurdistan]]i government was reportedly unaware of the US plans to raid the Iranian liaison office and did not know the purpose of the operation. After raiding the office, the US forces headed for Eikawa district, which hosts foreign companies and countries' representatives. Security forces of the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party|Democratic Party of Kurdistan]] (KDP) reportedly surrounded three US military vehicles to prevent them from further action.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teluguportal.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=28059|title=WordPress › Error&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208032210/http://www.teluguportal.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=28059|archivedate=8 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told state-run radio the raid was against a diplomatic mission since the presence of Iranian staffers in Arbil was legal. Hosseini said the action by coalition forces reflected a continuation of pressure on Iran, aiming to "create tension" between Iraq and its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/11/ap3322132.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117015100/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/11/ap3322132.html|archivedate=2007-01-17 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tehran]], Iran summoned the ambassadors of [[Iraq]] and [[Switzerland]] (which represents US interests in Iran) over the consulate raid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The [[UN Secretary General]]'s described the incident as "disputes between individual states". A UN spokesman said "We've left it to the respective countries to work it out among themselves ... Ultimately it's up to Security Council members themselves to determine how its resolutions get implemented."&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes-20070331 /&gt;

On March 10 at a meeting of envoys in [[Baghdad]] the Iranian delegation raised the issue of the five detained Iranians. A US spokesman said that Iraq had asked the US side to investigate the circumstances involving the detention. Iran says it was assured by Iraq that the five would be released by March 21, the [[Iranian new year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/b9422276-dd47-11db-8d42-000b5df10621.html Mideast security talks face delay], [[Financial Times]], 28 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that the increased diplomatic tension created by this incident lead to the [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel|Iranian seizure of 15 Royal Navy personnel]] in a border dispute two months later.&lt;ref name=Independent-20070403 /&gt;

===Alleged retaliation===
According to American journalist [[Robin Wright (author)|Robin Wright]], the [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel|2007 seizure of fifteen British sailors]] in the Persian Gulf was likely connected to the holding of the five Iranian officials. The seizure of the British came three days after [[Nowruz]], a date that the Iranian government had announced that it expected the five officials to be freed by, and which passed without their release. "The common denominator was the Revolutionary Guards." Iranians being held by the US were "[[Quds Force]] operatives" (the foreign operation branch of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]]), while the Iranian naval unit that had taken the British hostage were also Revolutionary Guards.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008 p.335&lt;/ref&gt; When the Sailors were released twelve days later and the five Iranians remained in detained, "Tehran shifted its focus", according to Wright. One month later four Iranian Americans with dual nationalities—[[Ali Shakeri]], [[Haleh Esfandiari]], [[Kian Tajbakhsh]], [[Parnaz Azima]]—were detained for unspecified `crimes against national security.`&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008 p.335-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==In custody==
The Iranian consular officers were: Naser Bagheri, [[Mousa Chegini]], Abbas Hatami Kakavand, Hamid Askari Shokouh and Majid Ghaemi.&lt;ref name=iran-20070119 /&gt;

Under [[Law enforcement in Iraq|Iraqi law]], detainees identified as insurgents should be charged in civilian courts. They may be held up to 14 days before being brought before a magistrate. These requirements appear to be systematically ignored in practice.&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes-20070331 /&gt; In this incident, the Iraqi government denies that the detainees were helping insurgents.&lt;ref name="w3123" /&gt;

In 2008&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/en/countries/Iraq/214878|title=albawaba.com middle east news information::Iran complains about detention conditions of diplomats in US custody&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; three of the five Iranian detainees were being held at a U.S. prison camp in Iraq.

===Release of some Iranians===
On November 9, 2007, United States released two of the detainees (after 305 days) as well as 7 other Iranian citizens. The other seven Iranians being freed had been picked up in different parts of the country and held for periods ranging between three months and three years.&lt;ref name=bbc-20071109&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7086402.stm|title=US releases nine Iranians in Iraq|date=9 November 2007|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the list of those who were released:&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.radiozamaneh.info/news/2007/11/_9_1.html رادیو زمانه | خبر اول | ايران و آمريکا | 9 ایرانی از زندان آمریکا در عراق آزاد شدند&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universal Hip Hop Parade''' '''(UHHP)''' is an annual family-friendly [[non-profit]] [[educational]] and [[cultural]] event held in the historically [[Black people|Black]] [[neighbourhood]] of [[Bedford Stuyvesant]] [[Brooklyn]] on the Saturday before the anniversary of [[Marcus Garvey|Marcus Garvey's]] August 17 birthday to bring to mind that Marcus Garvey himself also used [[popular culture]] as a tool to empower people and encouraged the growth of [[African American culture|Black institutions]].

[[Image:ManWithBanner.jpg|left|thumb|Parade]]
The [[parade]] holds the distinction of being the world's longest celebration of [[Hip-hop culture]].  It covers all the traditional elements of [[Hip hop]] including [[rappers]], [[Breakdance|break dancers]], [[singers]] and [[actors]] performing both on floats and on foot. Additionally, [[Graffiti|graffiti artists]] and [[Disc jockey|deejay’s]] perform at different locations along the parade route.

The parade also presents other examples of the vibrant artistic and cultural life of the community including [[stilt walker]]s, [[motorcycle club|motorcycle]] &amp; [[car club|van]] clubs, [[graffiti|graffiti banner displays]], [[marching band]]s, sound trucks, [[dancers]] and more. Additionally Hip-hop legends, [[elected official]]s, [[activist|community activists]] and legendary [[Master of Ceremonies|MC’s]] have participated.
The parade also serves to display the emerging [[neighborhood]] of [[Bedford Stuyvesant]], including its [[art]]s, [[culture]] and growing [[commercial district]] to the residents from other neighborhoods of [[New York City]] as well as other [[tourists|visitors]] to the area.  Local organizations showcase their artistic creativity, membership and colors while promoting their services, events and products. Neighborhood businesses and institutions along the route play music and distribute giveaways to help create a festive environment.  Residents and visitors alike are urged to participate and join the parade procession..

==History==
The Universal Hip Hop Parade was founded by Jeffery Kazembe Batts, Charles Barron, Freedom Williams and a host of activists in the fall of 1999 to celebrate the [[African American]] [[cultural]] [[activist|social activist]] roots of [[hip-hop culture]]. It is an outgrowth of the work of an earlier group, the Universal Nubian Association (UNA). Organizers come from across the [[New York City|NYC metropolitan area]] and have agreed to organize the UHHP in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.

In 2007 The Parade Made a Major Transition with Making the Mover and Shaker Out of Bed Stuy Brooklyn Mike Hollywood Christie aka Dj Dr Hollywood at the Helm and He took the Organization to New Heights with Monthly Open Mic's and Helping the Parade Reach its highest viewing numbers to date. Mike Hollywood Christie was the Parade Chairman from 2007 - 2011 and August 2013 - March 2014.

In addition to running the parade itself the [[nonprofit]] group Universal Hip-Hop Parade Foundation, Inc. also organizes forums, concerts, open-mike's, rallies, teach-ins and parties throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourtimepress.com/NewsDescribe.asp?NewsID=190&amp;News_Type=Loca 10th Congressional District Candidates,Two Sides of the Same Coin]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028071402/http://www.ourtimepress.com/NewsDescribe.asp?NewsID=190&amp;News_Type=Loca |date=October 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation is funded through private donations and grants including the Greater New York Development Fund of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, administrated by the Brooklyn Arts Council (BAC).

The '''Washington State Apple Blossom Festival''' is a [[festival]] held annually in [[Wenatchee, Washington|Wenatchee]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] from the last weekend in April to the first weekend in May. The festival, first held in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=National Phenology Network| title=Washington State Apple Blossom Festival| accessdate=2012-03-22| url=http://www.usanpn.org/node/3971}}&lt;/ref&gt; has grown from a one-day event to an eleven-day affair including a [[carnival]], golf tournament, food fair, multiple parades, an arts and crafts fair, entertainment on a stage in Memorial Park, and other amusements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=The Seattle Traveler| title=Washington State Apple Blossom Festival in Wenatchee| accessdate=2012-03-22| url=http://www.theseattletraveler.com/2007/04/washington-state-apple-blossom-festival-in-wenatchee/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Washington State Apple Blossom Festival, originally called "Blossom Days", was founded in 1919 to celebrate the importance of the [[apple]] industry to the region. The Ladies Musical Club produced the first festival in 1920, a one-day event in Memorial Park involving songs, speeches, [[Maypole|maypoles]], and baseball. The festival's relative success in drawing in large crowds from the area assured the continuation of the festival in subsequent years. In 1921, the Commercial Club, forerunner of the Wenatchee Valley Chamber of Commerce, took over sponsorship of the celebration.&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;{{cite web| title=Our History| publisher=Washington State Apple Blossom Festival| accessdate=2012-03-22| url=http://www.appleblossom.org/about/history/apple-blossom-history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the festival began again after [[World War II]], the festival was renamed the Washington State Apple Blossom Festival to more accurately reflect the importance of the [[Horticulture industry|apple industry]] in North [[Central Washington]].&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

In 1967, Wenatchee established a [[sister city]] relationship with the Aomori Apple Blossom Festival in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;
