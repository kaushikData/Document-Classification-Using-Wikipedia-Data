'''Aatsista-Mahkan''' or '''Running Rabbit''' (''[[Circa|c.]]'' 1833 &amp;ndash; probably 24 January 1911) was a [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the [[Siksika Nation|Siksika]] [[First Nation]]. He was the son of [[Akamukai]] (Many Swans), chief of the  Biters band, and following the death of his father in 1871, Aatsista-Mahkan took control of the band.&lt;ref name = "canbio"&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=7165 Biography at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his generosity and kindness, and for his loyal protection of his family.&lt;ref name = "canbio" /&gt;

In 1877, he was a signatory to [[Treaty 7]], but he and his people continued to follow the [[bison]] until 1881, when he and his people were designated to settle on a [[indian reserve|reserve]], 60 miles east of today's [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name = "canbio" /&gt;

==Early life==
Running Rabbit was born into a prominent family. His older brother Many Swans, who took their father's name, was chief of Biters band of Siksikas to which they belonged. As a teenager and young warrior, Running Rabbit had not performed any great deeds worthy of recognition until his brother lent him an amulet said to have spiritual powers made from a mirror decorated with eagle feathers, ermine skins, and magpie feathers. Running Rabbit was successful during his first ever raid as a warrior, gaining himself two enemy horses which he captured and gifted to Many Swans. Similar success during following expeditions resulted in Many Swans giving Running Rabbit the amulet as a gift. Word of Running Rabbit's success spread throughout the Biters band and many referred to him as the "young chief" before he earned or was appointed any leadership position in the band.

==Chief of the Biters band==
During the autumn of 1871, chief Many Swans, the chief of the Biters band of the Siksika nation and brother of Running Rabbit, died resulting in Running Rabbit being appointed as chief of the biters. During his career as a band chief he was noted for his kindness, generosity and intelligence.

{{quote|When Running Rabbit was among his band, his men were invited to eat, smoke, tell stories every day. He was generous. He gave his running horses out during hunts. Running Rabbit had four wives; two put up Sun Dances. He was kind to children and women.|-Descendent of Running Rabbit

[[File:Running Rabbit - Chief Blackfeet Indians.jpg|thumb|left|Chief Running Rabbit]]
Due to his intelligence and kindness, Running Rabbit was often looked upon to settle disputes within the band and nation. One incident happened during the early 1870s along the [[Oldman River]] where a man from the biters band accidentally killed one of [[Crowfoot|Crowfoot's]] daughters with a loaded gun. The man hid from Crowfoot who sought to kill him in retaliation in Running Rabbit's teepee. Running Rabbit stressed to Crowfoot that the killing was an accident and gave Crowfoot some horses as added compensation. Though usually peaceful in settling disputes Running Rabbit resorted to violence when the well being of his family was threatened, a noted incident involved Running Rabbit shooting a fellow Indian for beating his blind brother with a whip.

==Treaty No.7 signing==
Running Rabbit signed [[Treaty 7|Treaty No.7]] with the Canadian government alongside other Siksika nation chiefs including Crowfoot and Old Sun. The treaty promised the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]] reserve lands, hunting rights, trapping rights, and annual provisions/and or payments from the Queen in exchange for all of the traditional territory of the confederacy with the exception of lands set aside for reservations. Running Rabbit was recognized as a minor Siksika chief and was listed as having 90 followers. Running Rabbit and his band continued to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle until the last bison herds within the area were destroyed in 1881, resulting in his band and others of the Siksika nation settling on their previously set aside reserve 60 miles east of [[Calgary]] Alberta. On the reservation Running Rabbit was noted for trying to adapt to a new lifestyle which was forced upon them, becoming a noted farmer in 1887.

==Later life and death==
In 1892 after the death of head chief No-okska-stumik (Three Bulls), Running Rabbit was appointed as one of the two head chiefs of the Siksika nation alongside fellow chief Old Sun. He remained known for his wisdom, kindness and progressiveness. In 1898 he had made enough money harvesting hay to buy a high top buggy. Running Rabbit died in 1911.

'''Allan Hendry''' (born 1950) is an American [[astronomer]] and [[ufology|ufologist]]. UFO historian [[Jerome Clark]] calls him "one of the most skilled investigators in the history of UFO research."&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Jerome Clark | last = Clark | first = Jerome | title = The UFO Encyclopedia | edition = 2nd | volume = 1 (A-K) | publisher = Omnigraphics, Inc. | date = 1998 | isbn = 0-7808-0097-4 }} ''page 481''&lt;/ref&gt; He was the main investigator for the [[Center for UFO Studies]] (CUFOS) in the 1970s.

==Education and career==

Hendry earned a B.A. in [[astronomy]] from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1972.

==UFO research==

Hendry was hired for CUFOS by the organization's founder, [[J. Allen Hynek]], who was seeking a full-time investigator with scientific expertise and an open-minded attitude, and who was neither a [[debunker]] nor a "UFO believer".

As the chief investigator for CUFOS during most of the 1970s, Hendry personally investigated over 1000 UFO reports. He was able to find mundane explanations for the vast majority of UFO cases, but he also judged a small percentage of cases to be unexplained. One of the most famous "unexplained" cases he investigated was the [[Val Johnson Incident]] in 1979, in which a deputy sheriff in Minnesota experienced a "collision" with an unknown object which damaged his patrol car and left him temporarily unconscious. Hendry was the primary ufologist to investigate the case; in 1980 he debated the incident with well-known UFO debunker [[Philip Klass]] at a symposium held at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

He was reluctant to speculate as to origins of the unexplained cases, and argued they might be explainable with further data, leading some researchers to label Hendry a "closet [[skeptic]]".&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt; At the same time, a few noted skeptics and [[debunker]]s who had praised Hendry's scientific rigor subjected him to strong criticism for his conclusion that a handful of well-documented UFO reports seemed to defy analysis, and might represent genuine anomalies. Hendry suggested that the criticism from both camps were little more than ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks, since they typically paid little or no attention to the substance of his research.

==The UFO Handbook==

Hendry's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' was ''The UFO Handbook'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The UFO Handbook: A Guide to Investigating, Evaluating and Reporting UFO Sightings | last = Hendry | first = Allan | isbn = 978-0-385-14348-6 | date = August 1979 | publisher = Doubleday }}&lt;/ref&gt; a guide for other UFO investigators. In the book, Hendry castigates many mainstream scientists for what he sees as their neglecting UFO studies, but he also had strong criticism for many amateur UFO investigators, who he thought did the subject more harm than good. Clark characterized Hendry's appraisal of ufology in general as "deeply pessimistic", concluding that the subject was all but paralyzed by infighting, a lack of cooperation and standardization, and dubious claims. ''The UFO Handbook'' even earned the praise of arch-skeptic [[Philip J. Klass]], who in a review published in ''The [[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' described the book as "one of the most significant and useful books on the subject ever published."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nicap.org/klassvufo.htm | title = Phil Klass vs. The "UFO Promoters" | authorlink = Jerome Clark | first = Jerome | last = Clark | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204071832/http://www.nicap.org/klassvufo.htm | archive-date = February 4, 2012 | dead-url = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an undated [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview (sometime after 1994, based on publication dates of a few cited books), Klass again recommends Hendry's  book, calling it "Once [sic] of the best."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna/3282_pklass.html | title = Philip Klass Q&amp;A | publisher = [[PBS]] | work = Ask the Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1978 presentation at [[Walsh University|Walsh College]], Hendry said "Maybe I'm the most skeptical of the people at the center. I'm in this thing to get an answer to the UFO question, whatever it is. If it's sociological, fine. If it's extra-terrestial, fine. But I know there's no blanket explanation at this time. I've never seen a UFO and that's probably a good thing, because people might question my motives if I were personally involved." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Facinelli |first1=Paul |title=UFO man has facts, but no 'explanation' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23807153/allan_hendry/ |accessdate=16 November 2018 |agency=Akron Beacon Journal |date=13 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; His presentation also included information on [[Identification studies of UFOs|identifying flying objects]].

In the early 1980s [[CUFOS]] experienced some financial difficulties, and as a result the organization could no longer afford a full-time researcher. In addition, Hendry had come to the conclusion that the methodologies used to study UFOs were ultimately frustrating, inconclusive and futile. As a result, Hendry left CUFOS and has largely avoided further involvement in UFO studies.

==Early life==
She was born ''Amable Quiambao'' on January 19, 1947 in [[Bacacay, Albay]]. She has two siblings - Medgardo and Lui Quiambao-Manansala.

==Personal life==
She was married to former actor and [[bass-baritone]] [[opera singer]] Gamaliel "Gammy" Viray.  The couple had only one son, Ishmael Viray. Her sister, Lui Quiambao-Manansala, is also an actress and her niece, [[Miriam Quiambao]], was a former [[Binibining Pilipinas]] Universe winner and 1st runner-up at the [[Miss Universe 1999]]. She was also a former instructor of [[St. Paul University Quezon City]] for the students of AB Mass Communications.

==Theatre==
Quiambao began her career exclusively as a [[theatre]] actress. Her first play was "Ang Mga Tagahabi", directed by [[Rolando Tinio]] (an adaptation of [[The Weavers (play)|The Weavers]] by Gerhart Hauptmann), when she was a drama student at the [[Philippine Normal University]] in [[Manila]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt; She later earned her [[Master's degree]] in Drama Education from the [[University of the Philippines]].  She became a regular performer at the [[Teatro Pilipino]] and ''Bulwagang Gantimpala'' theatre groups at the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] in Manila. She played the role of President [[Corazon Aquino]] at the 1986 [[political satire]] ''"Bongbong at Kris"'' at CCP's ''Bulwagang Gantimpala'' in 1986.&lt;ref name=abs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt;

==Film==
Ama made her film debut in 1982, when she starred in the movie ''[[Himala]]'' (Miracle), directed by [[Ishmael Bernal]].&lt;ref name=abs/&gt; Film director Bernal wanted to cast theatre and radio actors in ''Himala'', so theatre director Rolando Tinio recommended the casting of Quiambao. She was chosen for the role of Sepa, a disciple of the lead character Elsa, played by famous actress [[Nora Aunor]].  Her role in ''Himala'' earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the [[Gawad Urian Award]]s in 1982.  A restored version of ''Himala'' was screened at the 2012 [[Venice Film Festival]] to mark its 20th anniversary.&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt;

Three decades later, Quiambao was cast as Lusing in the 2012 film, ''[[Diablo (film)|Diablo]]'', which was directed by Mes de Guzman and produced by his wife, [[Rhea Operaña de Guzman]].&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt; Lusing was a very serious, strict character in the film, which Quiambao described as the opposite of her personality.&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt;

Her work in ''Diablo'' earned Quiambao the first acting award of her career.&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdi2/&gt; In 2012, she won "Best Actress in the New Breed category" at the [[8th Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=abs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt; In a later interview, Quiambao described her reaction to winning the honor, "I was strangely calm,” she recalled. “I didn’t feel cold; I didn’t cry. I was glad that the trophy was presented to me by [[Iza Calzado|Iza [Calzado]]]. I’ve worked with her a number of times on TV and in the movies. I love that girl."&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt; She also said that she was thrilled to see other veteran Filipino actors win Cinemalaya awards that years, including [[Anita Linda]] and [[Eddie Garcia]], which she called "the night of [[senior citizens]]."&lt;ref name=pdi/&gt;

==Death==
Quiambao suffered a heart attack on June 28, 2013 while attending the premiere of the one-act play, ''Pamamanhikan'', which she was performing in as part of the ''Virgin Labfest 9'' theatre festival.&lt;ref name=abs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdi2/&gt; She died at Capitol Medical Center in [[Quezon City]] at 8:09&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 5, 2013, at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=abs/&gt; Her funeral was held at the Arlington Memorial Chapels in Quezon City.&lt;ref name=abs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdi2/&gt;

Quiambao appeared posthumously in her final film, ''[[Ang Kwento Ni Mabuti]]''.

'''Anantanand Rambachan''' is a [[Hindu]] [[Indo-Caribbean Americans|Indo-Trinidadian American]] scholar, teaching and researching as Professor of Religion at [[St. Olaf College]], [[Minnesota]], USA with a specific focus on interreligous dialogue.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Rambachan was born in [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="Untangling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/culture/untangling-the-false-knots-in-rajiv-malhotras-indras-net/|title=Untangling The False Knots In Rajiv Malhotra’s Indra’s Net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his grandfathers were Hindu priests,&lt;ref name="Untangling" /&gt; who remained faithful to Hinduism, despite British pressures.&lt;ref name="Untangling" /&gt; At high school, he was impressed by Swami Vivekananda.&lt;ref name="Untangling" /&gt; After completing his undergraduate studies, Rambachan studied Advaita at Sandeepany Sadhanalaya, a Hindu seminary of the [[Chinmaya Mission]] in Mumbai, India, with [[Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya)|Swami Dayananda Saraswati]]:&lt;ref name="Untangling" /&gt;

===Education===
Rambachan completed his undergraduate studies at the [[University of the West Indies]], St. Augustine, Trinidad. He received his M.A. (Distinction) and Ph.D. degrees from the [[University of Leeds]], in the United Kingdom, where he researched "classical Advaita epistemology and, in particular, the significance of the śruti as a source of valid knowledge (pramāṇa) in Śaṅkara."&lt;ref name="Untangling" /&gt;

Since 1985 Rambachan has been teaching in the Department of Religion at St. Olaf College, Minnesota, USA, where he "continued my research and writing on Advaita, the Hindu tradition in a global context, Hindu ethics, Hinduism and contemporary issues and interreligious dialogue."&lt;ref name="Untangling" /&gt;Since 2013, Professor Rambachan has been Forum Humanum Visiting Professor at the Academy for  World Religions at Hamburg University, Germany.

'''Bassam Frangieh''' (Arabic: '''بسام فرنجيه''') is a scholar of contemporary [[Arabic literature]] and culture.  He is best known for his pedagogical innovations in the study of the [[Arabic language]], as well as his translations of modern Arabic poets and novelists.  Frangieh also lectures on the society and culture of the Arab world.  A language professor as well as a scholar and writer, Frangieh has achieved moderate fame in the American academic world of [[Middle Eastern Studies]] for his engaging educational methods.

== Education and career ==

Frangieh was born in a refugee camp in [[Lebanon]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toomajian|first=Martin|title=Frangieh focuses on views of 'Arab street'|url=http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/651|accessdate=October 25, 2011|newspaper=Yale Daily News|date=April 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family, Palestinians who had owned an orange grove in Yaffa, had been relocated there due to the conflicts associated with the creation of the state of Israel.  His family is distantly related to the famous [[Frangieh family of Lebanon|Frangieh]] family of [[Lebanon]], including former Lebanese president [[Suleiman Frangieh]], but the Palestinian Frangieh [[family tree]] diverged from the Lebanese family tree several generations ago.  Frangieh eventually moved to [[Syria]] to attend university, earning a B.A. from [[Damascus University]] in 1976.  While in Syria, he earned fame as a [[boxing]] champion and professional [[soccer]] player.  Frangieh attended graduate school in the United States, and received a Ph.D. in Arabic literature from [[Georgetown University]] in 1987.  After receiving his doctorate, Frangieh taught Arabic at Georgetown for several years before accepting a position at [[Yale University]]. After his resignation from Yale in 2007, Frangieh joined [[Claremont McKenna College]] as a full-time Arabic professor and the head of the Arabic Department for the five [[Claremont Colleges]] while writing and researching new Arabic books. He is the head of the Middle East studies department.

A notable alumna that Frangieh oversaw was Catherine Blakelock, who became an Army officer in New York State with the 1-258 FA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url=https://dmna.ny.gov/pressroom/?id=1359574028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernardo Bandini Baroncelli''' (15 January 1420 – 29 December 1479) was an Italian [[merchant]] and one of the instigators of the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DBI |title=BANDINI dei Baroncelli, Bernardo |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/bandini-dei-baroncelli-bernardo_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ |last=Pampaloni |first=Guido |volume=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the opening stroke of the Pazzi Conspiracy, [[Giuliano de' Medici]] was assassinated on [[Easter Sunday]], 26 April 1478 in the [[Duomo of Florence]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore]], by [[Francesco de' Pazzi]] and Bernardo Baroncelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smedley |first=Edward |last2=James |first2=Hugh James |last3=Rose |first3=Henry John |title=Encyclopaedia Metropolitana; Or, Universal Dictionary of Knowledge on an Original Plan Comprising the Twofold Advantage of a Philosophical and an Alphabetical Arrangement, with Appropriate Engravings |url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_QGM8I7n97nEC#page/n279 |publisher=B.

Bernardo Baroncelli was drawn in a macabre sketch by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli hanged, in connection with the murder of Giuliano in the [[Pazzi conspiracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A.

'''Francisca da Silva de Oliveira'''  (c. 1732-1796), known in history by the name '''Chica da Silva'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/ult1789u167.jhtm Chica da Silva]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dicionarioegramatica.com/2015/12/06/chica-ou-xica-da-silva-o-certo-e-xica-ou-chica-da-silva/ Chica ou Xica da Silva? in: DicionarioeGramatica.com&lt;/ref&gt; whose romanticized version/character is also known by the spelling ''Xica da Silva''&lt;ref&gt;http://dicionarioegramatica.com/2015/12/06/chica-ou-xica-da-silva-o-certo-e-xica-ou-chica-da-silva/ Chica ou Xica da Silva? in: DicionarioeGramatica.com&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Brazil]]ian woman who became famous for becoming rich and powerful despite having been born into [[slavery]]. Her life has been a source of inspiration for many works in [[television]], [[film]]s, [[music]], [[theater]] and [[literature]]. She is popularly known as ''the slave who became a queen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistadehistoria.com.br/v2/home/?go=detalhe&amp;id=638 Para Conhecer Chica da Silva] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521194655/http://www.revistadehistoria.com.br/v2/home/?go=detalhe&amp;id=638 |date=May 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth of Chica da Silva is often conflated with the historical accounts of Francisca da Silva de Oliveira.

==Biography==

Francisca da Silva de Oliveira was a parda woman born in [[Vila do Príncipe]] (nowadays [[Serro]]), in the north of the state of [[Minas Gerais]], in Brazil between 1730 and 1735.  Not unlike many other regions in Brazil, this region's population was majority afro-descended peoples, with slaves outnumbering whites by a large margin.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Edward Conrad, "Children of God's Fire"&lt;/ref&gt; People in the town made a living either through gold or diamond mining. She lived mainly in [[Arraial do Tijuco]] (nowadays known as Diamantina) and was the daughter of a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese man]], Antônio Caetano de Sá and an [[Slavery in Brazil|enslaved]] [[Afro-Brazilians|African]] woman, Maria da Costa, who was probably from the [[Gulf of Guinea]] or [[Bahia]]. The region of [[Minas Gerais]] was unique in that it had a fairly diverse population in comparison to other slave regions on the Brazilian coast, Caribbean, and the United States.

Known as "Francisca parda" while enslaved, Francisca's first owner was Domingos da Costa, who was from Milho Verde. After Costa, Francisca was sold to Sergeant Manuel Pires Sardinha, with whom she had her first son, Simão Pires Sardinha.&lt;ref&gt;Júnia Ferrera Furtado, "Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century."&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sardinha listed Simão as one of his heirs, Sardinha never officially declared paternity of Simão.&lt;ref&gt;Júnia Ferrera Furtado, "Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century."&lt;/ref&gt; Francisca's third master was [[João Fernandes de Oliveira]], a [[diamond]] mine owner and mining Governor of Arraial do Tijuco, one of the richest persons of [[Colonial Brazil]]. Because Francisca later added "da Silva" as a surname, it is often incorrectly concluded that she was once owned by a José da Silva de Olivera. The name, however, was very common among the Portuguese at the time and offered a fresh start.&lt;ref&gt;Júnia Ferrera Furtado, "Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources suggest that Francisca was granted her [[Manumission|freedom]], either by José da Silva de Oliveira at the request of João Fernandes or that she was given her freedom directly by João Fernandes when he bought her from Pires Sardinha in 1753.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=Maria Angélica Alves|last2=Gico|first2=Vânia|last3=Stromquist|first3=Nelly P.|date=2005|title=Chica da Silva: Myth and Reality in an Extreme Case of Social Mobility|jstor=41675671|journal=Iberoamericana (2001-)|volume=5|issue=17|pages=7–28|doi=10.2307/41675671}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being granted her freedom, Chica officially changed her name to Francisca da Silva de Oliveira in order to erase her history as a slave. This was hugely beneficial for her son Simão Pires Sardinia who later in life was able hide his mothers slave ancestry and his status of being an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate son]] in order to receive the prestigious Portuguese title, ''the knight of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]].'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chic a da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century|last=Furtado|first=Júnia Ferreira|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisca and João soon started a relationship. Despite not being officially married, they lived together for several years and had 13 children: Francisca de Paula (1755); João Fernandes (1756); Rita (1757); Joaquim (1759); Antonio Caetano (1761); Ana (1762); Helena (1763); Luiza (1764); Antônia (1765); Maria (1766); Quitéria Rita (1767); Mariana (1769); José Agostinho Fernandes (1770). Soon after, Chica became an independent owner of a house in Tejuco on Opera Street. The house was adorned with many luxuries including an extensive garden, her own personal chapel, and furniture like bathtubs, armoires, mirrors and canopy beds, that were rare to households at the time. Chica was also the owner of many slaves who both helped her in the house and worked in the mines in the region. Chica also presented herself in a very ostentatious manner in order to help differentiate herself from the other mixed people in society. People often showed their status through their material items, which for Chica included her clothing, home, slaves, and change in name. By the end of her life she also included [[Don (honorific)|Dona]] at the beginning of her name for a more prestigious title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/chica-da-silva|title=Chica da Silva|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia of African American Culture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1770, João Fernandes had to return to Portugal and took along with him the 4 sons he had with Chica as well as Chica's two other sons Placid Pires Sardinha and Simão Pires Sardinha, whom were granted [[Nobility|noble]] titles by the Portuguese Court. Their daughters remained with Chica in Brazil and were sent to then renowned [[Convent]] of Macaúbas. Even after the departure of João to Portugal, Chica retained her prestige. She was a member of the ''São Francisco do Carmo'' Brotherhood (exclusive to whites), ''[[Mercês, Minas Gerais|Mercês]]'' Brotherhood (exclusive to mulattaoes) and of ''[[Rosário do Sul|Rosário]]'' Brotherhood (exclusive to Africans).

Chica da Silva died in 1796. She was buried at the Church of São Francisco de Assis, a privilege that only wealthy whites enjoyed.

==Gender in Colonial Brazil==

In eighteenth century Brazil, colonizers and slaves were both overwhelmingly male. Portuguese men had traveled to Brazil alone to seek wealth, as Portuguese women were often banned from migrating.&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Telles, "Race in Another America," Princeton University Press (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In part due to love affairs and children born between Portuguese men and African and/or mulatta slave women, freed former slaves were predominately female.&lt;ref&gt;Júnia Ferreira Furtado, "Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century," Cambridge University Press (2009), 15&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes about non-white women were abundant during the colonial period and while gender, race and color worked together to systemically disadvantage negro women, some individuals—such as Chica—used their perceived hyper-sensuality to invert gender and power relations.&lt;ref&gt;Júnia Ferrera Furtado, "Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century," Cambridge University Press (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Once socially mobile, these women were seen as even more dominant than their masters.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Sex was decisive to the relative facilitated access to freedom and concubinage with white men offered advantages to black women because, once free, they reduced the stigma of color and of slavery for them and for their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Chica da Silva sem X http://www.universia.com.br/materia/materia.jsp?id=2452{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The myth==

Chica's legacy was often misused to symbolize Brazil's so called "[[racial democracy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Júnia Ferrera Furtado, "Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century," Cambridge University Press (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, however, scholars maintain that she used [[miscegenation]] and her connections as a tool to achieve a higher social status, as did other African Brazilians at the time. Historian [[Júnia Ferreira Furtado]] sustains that concubinage and marriage between white male and black female in colonial Brazilian society was a way found by the enslaved to change their social position and to escape racism {{Citation needed|reason=the quote provided directly contradicts the editor's claim of an 'escape from racism'|date=May 2014}}:

{{blockquote|Manumission, rather than the beginning for the formation of a positive black identity, was the beginning of a process of acceptance of values of the elite, in order to insert them (former slaves) as well as their descendants in this society.&lt;ref&gt;Chica da Silva sem X http://www.universia.com.br/materia/materia.jsp?id=2452{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

João Fernandes and Chica da Silva's relationship was a scandal in colonial Brazilian society. Chica da Silva, formerly enslaved, had become one of the most powerful women in colonial America{{Citation needed|reason=provide evidence of Chica's 'power'|date=May 2014}}. Chica was banished from the parish church, which was reserved for Caucasians only. To show the locals Chica's power, João Fernandes built a luxurious church attended just by herself. However, as Furtado discloses, Chica attended brotherhoods exclusive to whites, as a way to try to fit into the status quo and be aware of its schemes against her and her people.

Contrary to what was propagated,{{Citation needed|reason=propagated by who, when?|date=May 2014}} Chica also owned slaves, and is only known to have freed one of them. Historians view this as the main difference between the experience of Africans in Brazil and their counterparts in the [[United States]]{{Citation needed|reason=which historians think that black slaveholding is the main difference between the US and Brazil?|date=May 2014}}. While in the US, African-American former slaves had a more unified movement, in Brazil they tried to integrate into white society as mixed-race people saw that "[[Racial whitening|whitening]]" themselves was a way to escape from their slave past.{{Citation needed|reason=provide evidence of mixed-race Brazilians generally declaring that they 'whitened' themselves to escape from their enslaved past|date=May 2014}}  Although slaves didn't have any choice if the master or mistress decided to use them as sex objects, some were able to use the situation, especially in regard to their offsprings who were part European. The colonial Portuguese mentality was also more tolerant than the US Anglo-Saxon one on race when it had to do with their mixed-race offsprings. Whereas Anglo-Saxon slave holders forced their own race-mixed offsprings into slavery and sold them to other masters as well, making a profit from them, Luso-Brazilians generally freed {{Citation needed|reason=statistical evidence needed that white Brazilians 'generally freed' the children of their rape victims|date=May 2014}} their own mixed-race children and often granted them nobility titles. This happened perhaps because of the lack of Portuguese women that migrated to Brazil{{Citation needed|reason=if life for black women was so good in Brazil, why did Portuguese women not migrate?|date=May 2014}}.

{{blockquote|Chica, as the other freed female slaves, achieved her freedom, loved, had children and raised them up socially sought to reduce the mark that the condition{{Citation needed|reason=show evidence needed that brown skin is a 'condition'|date=May 2014}} of Parda (brown) and former slave had to herself and to her descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Chica da Silva sem X http://www.universia.com.br/materia/materia.jsp?id=2452{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Dan Boneh''' ({{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|ˈ|n|eɪ}}; {{lang-he|דן בונה}}) is a teacher and researcher in applied [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Israel]] in 1969,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Boneh obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from [[Princeton University]] in 1996 under the supervision of [[Richard J. Lipton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cryptography Is Dead? | date = March 2013 | url=http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/cryptography-is-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=70975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boneh is one of the principal contributors to the development of [[pairing-based cryptography]] from the Weil Pairing, along with Matt Franklin of the [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Google Scholar citations of Boneh-Franklin paper | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=1257489057529642161&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He joined the faculty of [[Stanford University]] in 1997, and became professor of [[computer science]] and [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dan Boneh's Publications by Topic | url=http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/pubsbytopic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dan Boneh's Google Scholar Profile | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Dan+Boneh%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He teaches [[massive open online course]]s on the online learning platform [[Coursera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Dan Boneh |work= Coursera instructor profile |url= https://en.coursera.org/instructor/~774 |access-date= April 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999 he was awarded a fellowship from the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Dan Boneh: 1999 Fellow |publisher= David and Lucile Packard Foundation |url= https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/conservation-and-science/science/packard-fellowships-for-science-and-engineering/fellowship-directory/boneh-dan/ |access-date= March 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, he co-founded a company called Voltage Security with three of his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Voltage Security, Inc., Corporate Fact Sheet |work= Old web site |url= http://www.voltage.com/about/factsheet.htm |deadurl= yes |archivedate= July 18, 2004 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040718071835/http://www.voltage.com/about/factsheet.htm |access-date= March 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was acquired by [[Hewlett Packard]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= HP set to acquire encryption firm Voltage Security |author= Mary Azevedo |date= February 20, 2015 |work= RCR Wireless news |url= http://www.rcrwireless.com/20150220/telecom-software/hp-set-acquire-voltage-security |access-date= March 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Hewlett-Packard buys Cupertino’s Voltage Security for data protection |author= Jeremy C.

In 2018, Boneh became co-director (with [[David Mazières]]) of the newly founded Center for Blockchain Research at Stanford, predicting at the time that "[[Blockchain|Blockchains]] will become increasingly critical to doing business globally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-computer-scientists-launch-center-blockchain-research|title=Stanford computer scientists launch the Center for Blockchain Research|date=2018-06-20|work=Stanford School of Engineering|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lord Byron 1804-6 Crop.jpg|thumbnail|Byron in his late teens. 1804–1806]]

'''George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron of Rochdale''', better known as the poet '''[[Lord Byron]]''', was born 22 January 1788 in Holles Street, London, England, and raised by his mother in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland. His life was complicated by his father, who died deep in debt when he was a child. He was able to work his way through school, and his life advanced after he inherited both his great-uncle's title in 1798 and the [[Newstead Abbey]] estate.

Byron was the son of [[Captain John Byron|Captain John "Mad Jack" Byron]] and his second wife, the former Catherine Gordon, heiress of [[Gight]] in [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Byron family had a spotted history, with a history of inconstancy and debt, and the fifth Lord Byron gained reputations of being a whoremaster and a murderer. The poet's father, John Byron, was the first child of Vice-Admiral [[John Byron|John "Foulweather Jack" Byron]], the second son of the fourth Lord Byron. Like the rest of his family, his personal history was one of turmoil; he was one of nine children and was sent to a military school when it became clear that he was unfit for academia. He gambled profusely until his parents refused to pay off his debts, and he soon developed a reputation for womanising and exploiting his companions for money.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler 2000 pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1778, when 22, he ran off to France with the already married [[Amelia Osborne, Marchioness of Carmarthen|Amelia D'Arcy]], the heiress of the [[Earl of Holderness]] and of Baroness Conyers and the current Marchioness of Carmarthen.  He married her in 1779; they had three children, of whom only their daughter [[Augusta Leigh]] survived. Conyers died in 1784, and John Byron, in debt and deprived of his wife's £4000 a year income, went to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in search of another rich wife. Here he met Catherine Gordon, who was called his "Golden Dolly" for her fortune of £23,000; she was a direct descendant of [[James I of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gordon family, like the Byron family, had a history of turmoil and death; her grandfather drowned in 1760, her sister Abercromby died in 1777, her father drowned in Bath Canal in 1779, her other sister Margaret died in 1780, and her mother died in 1782. Her parents, to preserve the family name, had introduced a clause in their will that required the husband of their daughter to take the Gordon name as his own, which John Byron was eager to do.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler 2000 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The two married in Bath, 13 May 1785. By July the newly-weds had settled at [[Gight]] where John Byron ran through most of the £23,000 Catherine had brought to their marriage.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;McGann, Jerome, 'Byron, George Gordon Noel, sixth Baron Byron (1788–1824)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4279] accessed 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he sold her property, the Castle of Gight, for £18,690 to pay off his debts.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy 2002 p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1786 they went through a second marriage ceremony and John Byron became John Byron Gordon to fulfil the need to sell the estate in Gight. By the end of 1786, Catherine had lost her fortune and her land to John Byron's creditors but she never blamed him for her loss. In July 1787 John fled from the [[Isle of Wight]], where the couple had been living to avoid creditors, to Paris. He was joined there the following September by Mrs Byron who was pregnant. In December she returned to London whilst Byron's father remained on the move to avoid creditors.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Childhood==
[[Image:Lochnagar in winter by Bruce McAdam.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lochnagar corrie in winter. The area provided Byron with his inspiration for his 1807 poem, ''[[Lachin y Gair]]''.]]

Mayne states that George Gordon Byron was born 22 January 1788 in a house on 24 Holles Street in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lB43AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7 Mayne 1913 p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Robert Charles Dallas]] in his ''Recollections'' states that Byron was born in Dover.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJYHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR99 "Recollections of the life of Lord Byron, from the year 1808..."]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, John Byron and Gordon moved to Aberdeen, but this was not to last, as John wrote to his sister, "She is very amiable at a distance; but I defy you and all the Apostles to live with her two months, for if anybody could live with her, it was me".&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's parents then decided to live in separate houses upon the same street to see if the distance would allow them to bear each other, which left Byron to be raised by his mother and a nursemaid, Agnes Gray.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy 2002 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His parents would meet regularly until they realised that their separation did not solve their problems; John Byron would come to talk to his son, but after being allowed to take Byron to his house to spend one night, he realised that he could not tolerate either Byron or his mother any longer.  Shortly thereafter, John left Scotland to live with his sister Fanny (Frances) Leigh at [[Valenciennes]], France, the place where he would die in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; After John Byron's death, Gordon claimed that she "ever sincerely loved" Byron, and she despaired at her loss.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy 2002 p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Byronmother.jpg|thumbnail|left|Catherine Gordon]]
Catherine Gordon was taught to read at a young age and had a passion for literature, a passion she shared with her son. Byron would read through the Bible, focusing predominantly on the Old Testament, and he would also read works dealing with history or narrative tales like the ''Arabian Nights''.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy 2002 p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; However this passion for reading was not the only passion mother and child shared; Catherine was also known for having a violent temper.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The son inherited his mother's temper but he would not speak while he experienced various fits. On one occasion, the young Byron bit off a piece of a china saucer during his "silent rage".&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's problems were compounded by his mother's lack of money, especially with her having to provide for her delinquent husband. When word reached her that John Byron had died, she cried out loud enough for her neighbourhood to hear. However, her troubles were not over, for in his final moments John Byron had incurred even more debt, which burdened his widow to the point of having to move to another home in worse conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Without money, she was instead forced to send her son to a day-school at the Long Acre of Aberdeen. Byron did not learn anything at the school, and his mother was forced to hire a series of tutors who taught him literature until he was able to enter the [[Aberdeen Grammar School]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that Byron became fascinated with politics and began to practice writing narratives. Not everything taught to Byron was met with appreciation; Byron was brought up under [[Calvinism|Scottish Calvinistic]] influences including [[predestination]], which encouraged a pessimistic view of life. His mother felt that Byron took in "the gloomiest Calvinistic tenets" and believed that she was also "broken against the rock of Predestination."&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy 2002 pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and Newstead===
In 1796, Byron suffered from [[scarlet fever]], and his mother took him to the [[Scottish Highlands]] to stay in the mountains until his recovery. This experience affected Byron greatly, as he described in his poetry, especially his memory of the mountain of [[Lochnagar]] and a girl named Mary. He soon fell in love with another Mary, a cousin, and would still think of her until he was 27.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 1798, the death of Byron's great-uncle, the "wicked" Lord Byron, allowed the 10-year-old to become the 6th Baron Byron; he inherited the Rochdale estate in Lancashire, and [[Newstead Abbey]] in Nottinghamshire, coming under the care of his relative, Frederick Howard, Earl of Carlisle. Byron noticed no difference in how he was treated until the first time he was given the title ''dominus'' (meaning 'lord') in class; he was struck speechless and burst into tears while the other schoolchildren sat in amazement.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; However, little money came with the inheritance, as his great-uncle had already squandered most of his fortune; the fifth Lord Byron had sold the Rochdale estate illegally, and more money had to be put into a legal battle to restore Rochdale to Byron.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Newstead was in not in a state that allowed Byron and his mother to live there, they were able to move nearby Nottingham during August 1798. The residence formed by the ruins of Newstead Abbey adjoined by a large house served as an inspiration of Gothic themes and his belief that there are layers of history that are part of objects in life.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy 2002 pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; During his early moments at Newstead, Byron was attended to by a nurse, May Gray, who developed a reputation for "perpetually beating him", which shocked the residents of Nottingham.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; These beatings occurred as she attempted to educate Byron on religion, after which she abandoned the young boy in the dark.  This darkness particularly frightened Byron, as Gray led him to believe that the house was haunted at Gray's prompting. Byron's mother did not find out about these incidents until after Gray was dismissed in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

When Byron was born, he suffered from lameness and a twisted foot.&lt;ref name="Mayne p. 8"&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; After Gray was fired, Byron was put in the care of a "trussmaker to the General hospital", a man named Lavender, in hopes that he could be cured; however, Lavender instead abused the boy and would occasionally use him as a servant.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; After Byron exposed Lavender as a fool, Gordon took her son to visit Doctor [[Matthew Baillie]] in London. They took up residence at Sloane Terrace during the summer of 1799, and there Byron started to receive treatment, such as specially designed boots.&lt;ref name="Mayne p. 27"&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; This medical treatment amounted to £150 a year with 2 guineas per school visit by the physician.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Not all of Byron's experiences at Nottingham were for the worse, as Byron was popular among his relatives, such as his great-aunt Frances Byron and her Mrs Parkyns, and among the gentry, middle class, and other important individuals of Nottingham society.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy 2002 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In August 1799, Byron entered the school of [[William Glennie]], an [[Aberdonian]] in [[Dulwich]]. Glennie was Byron's first "serious teacher", but also one with whom Catherine Gordon would constantly squabble, especially over the control of her son's schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine's actions alienated her from both Glennie and Lord Carlisle, with Byron unable to do anything but observe.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of his suffering, Byron was able to perform his "first dash into poetry" in 1800; he wrote a love poem in honour of his cousin, Margaret Parker, "one of the most beautiful of evanescent beings"., and she would inspire another poem two years later when she died at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Byron also refused to let his lameness prevent him from participating in any of the usual physical activities that schoolboys engage in, and on one occasion threw his leg brace into a pond in defiance.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

In 1801, his mother declared "he must go to a public school", and Byron was soon after sent to [[Harrow School|Harrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; His experience at Harrow was dissatisfying to Byron as his lame foot, his lack of money, and his previously neglected education caused to say later that "I always ''hated'' Harrow till the last year and a half."&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; The Headmaster, [[Joseph Drury|Dr Joseph Drury]], believed that Byron was "a wild mountain colt" who had a "supersensitive vanity", and as a result placed him under the individual tutorial guidance of his own son Henry Drury, an assistant master, until he could be placed in a class of boys that were his own age.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the harsh treatment that he felt that he received at Harrow from the schoolmasters and some of the fellow students, Byron wrote to his mother in 1804: "I will cut myself a path through the world or perish in the attempt. Others have begun life with nothing and ended Greatly. And shall I who have a competent if not a large fortune, remain idle, No, I will carve myself the passage to Grandeur, but never with Dishonour."&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy 2002 p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Harrow, Byron became close to John FitzGibbon, second Earl of Clare, and with George John, fifth Earl De la Warr, and Byron retained memories of both. Clare in particular was Byron's favourite, and, after one meeting in which they could spend only five minutes together, Byron afterwards could "hardly recollect an hour of my existence which could be weighted against them".&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Byron had other friends at Harrow, including John Wingfield, Edward Noel Long, (grandson of [[Edward Long]]) and George, [[Earl of Dorset|Duke of Dorset]], all of whom appear in Byron's ''Childish Recollections''.  Only Long would continue to Cambridge with Byron.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; These friendships meant a lot to Byron, and when his friends started dying he claimed that "some curse hangs over me. I never could keep alive even a dog that I liked, or that liked me".&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of Byron's relationships encouraged him to stay at the school. Byron's early loves included Mary Duff and Margaret Parker, his distant cousins, and Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at Harrow. Byron refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 due to his love for Chaworth.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In Byron's later memoirs, according to Byron's biographer [[Fiona MacCarthy]], "Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings".&lt;ref name="MacCarthy p. 33"&gt;MacCarthy 2002 p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Harrow in January 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; By Easter of that year he had begun to correspond with his half-sister, Augusta. His early letters to her illustrate his earnest desire to establish an affectionate friendship with 'a Friend to whom I can confide.'&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

However, his time at Harrow was not spent just in idleness or with his friends; Byron busied himself by reading books; history was his primary subject, followed by biography, poetry, philosophy, and other topics. He was originally supposed to be an orator, and he would read various passages in aloud for others.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; However, Byron's attitude caused problems between him and the administration at Harrow (markedly, he led a rebellion among the boys against the new headmaster, the [[George Butler (headmaster)|Revd Dr George Butler]])&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; and during the 1804 Christmas holidays, Byron, at Drury's prompting, wanted to leave the school. However, Carlisle intervened and Byron stayed at Harrow until July 1805.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; He was accepted at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he went up the following October.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===College===
[[File:Byronshouse266.JPG|thumb|Byron's house in [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire]]]]
While not at school or college, Byron lived with his mother at Burgage Manor in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. Although there was some antagonism between mother and son, Byron cultivated friendships with [[Elizabeth Bridget Pigot|Elizabeth Pigot]] and her brother, John, with whom he staged two plays for the delight of the community, along with Augusta Mary Byron, his half-sister.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 69–74&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, with the help of Elizabeth Pigot, who copied many of his rough drafts, he was encouraged to write his first volumes of poetry. ''Fugitive Pieces'' was the first, printed by Ridge of Newark, which contained poems written when Byron was only 14.  However, it was promptly recalled and burned on the advice of his friend, the Reverend Thomas Becher, on account of its more amorous verses, particularly the poem "To Mary".&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition impression of the book, called ''Poems on Various Occasions'' printed in January 1807, was given to John Pigot as a gift that he cherished until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of Cambridge, Byron originally wanted to go to [[Christ Church, Oxford]] but there were no vacancies. Instead, he chose Cambridge at Drury's recommendation. The choice did not matter, since college life in general did not suit his personality. He wrote in his diary, "I was so completely alone in this new world that it half broke my spirits... It was one of the deadliest and heaviest feelings of my life that I was no longer a boy".&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not mitigate his contempt towards the other students, and he quickly grew dissatisfied with the society surrounding Cambridge: "It is the ''Devil'' or at least his principal residence. They call it the University, but any other appellation would have suited it better, for Study is the last pursuit of the Society".&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent his time with Long, and the two would swim, ride, read, and talk with each other. However, they shared a fear of becoming overweight, and this marked the beginning of Byron's "Thinning Campaign".&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Long was not Byron's only companion during this time; he had a short-lived friendship with John Edleston, a fifteen-year-old choirboy. About his "protégé" he wrote, "He has been my ''almost constant'' associate since October, 1805. His ''voice'' first attracted my attention, his ''countenance'' fixed it, and his ''manners'' attached me to him for ever."&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; The boy gave Byron a carnelian ring, in return for saving his life, and to which Byron wrote ''The Cornelian'' in October 1806:
:He offer'd it with downcast look,
:As ''fearful'' that I might refuse it;
:I told him, when the gift I took,
:My ''only fear'' should be, to lose it.
The two planned to live together after Edleston grew older, but the two parted and Byron would never see the boy again as Edleston died from consumption in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne 1913 pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; As well as spending time with friends, Byron did join in with the rest of the community; however, he did not enjoy this time because, as he said, "I could not share in the commonplace libertinism of the place and time without disgust. And yet this very disgust, and my heart thrown back upon itself, threw me into excesses perhaps more fatal than those from which I shrunk, as fixing upon one (at a time) the passions which, spread amongst many, would have hurt only myself".&lt;ref&gt;Byron 1886 Vol. V p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ernst Lindenbauer, 1936.jpg|thumb|Chief Rider Ernst Lindenbauer with two [[Lipizzan]] stallions.]]

'''Ernst Lindenbauer''' (18 November 1881 Lichtenegg/Wels &amp;ndash; 22 April 1961 Vienna) was Chief Rider from 1919 - 1950 at the [[Spanish Riding School]] in [[Vienna]].

Lindenbauer was born in [[Wels|Lichtenegg/Wels]], [[Upper Austria]], the son of a farmer. He took his first riding lessons at the age of 13. He had considerable natural talent, so after he finished school in 1895, he  became a student at the stables of [[Archduke Franz Salvator of Austria|Archduke Franz Salvator]] in Lichtenegg, where he was instructed in [[equestrianism|riding]], [[driving (horse)|driving]] and other aspects of handling horses. During his apprenticeship, Lindenbauer learned not only to school horses in [[dressage]], but did also [[horse racing]] and [[drag hunting]].

In 1900, he volunteered for military service in the "[[Dragoon|6th Dragoon Regiment]]" in [[Wels]], returning after three years to the service of Archduke Franz Salvator. From there he moved to Vienna, where on November 20, 1906 he entered the  [[Hofburg Imperial Palace|Imperial Campaign Riding School]] (''[[:de:Hofstallungen|Hofstallungen]]'')&lt;!--that's the link you added to Polak, I originally had the one to the Museum district...(!)--&gt;  as a student (''Hofreitskolar''). Later he was promoted to a Class II and then a Class I rider (''Bereiter''). During his time there, Lindenbauer trained young horses for the program (''Hofmarstall'') and he occasionally had the opportunity to train a few horses for [[Emperor Franz Josef]] that were used for [[parade]]s and [[Military exercise|maneuvers]]. 

In 1919, Lindenbauer was posted to a position at the [[Spanish Riding School]].  He was then promoted to Chief Rider (''Oberbereiter'') in 1926.  In that position, he played a substantial role in the preservation of the Spanish Riding School in the difficult [[interwar period]] as [[Central Europe]] changed from a [[monarchy]] to a [[republic]].  Although he was a quiet and [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] individual, he was one of the mainstays of the Spanish Riding School in his time.

'''Faouzi Chaouchi''' ({{lang-ar|فوزي شاوشي}}; born 5 December 1984 in [[Bordj Menaïel|Bordj Ménaïel]]) is an [[Algeria]]n professional [[Association football|football]] goalkeeper who last played for [[Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1]] club [[CA Bordj Bou Arréridj]] and the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dzfoot.com/joueur.php?joueur_id=1218&amp;saison_id=15 |title=La Fiche de Fawzi CHAOUCHI – Football algérien |publisher=Dzfoot.com |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126131811/http://www.dzfoot.com/joueur.php?joueur_id=1218&amp;saison_id=15 |archivedate=26 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaouchi is considered to be national hero by many [[Algeria]]ns, as he put in a heroic performance in the play-off that put the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian national team]] into their first World Cup finals since 1986 at the expense of their bitter rivals Egypt. He constantly denied the [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national team]] all scoring opportunities. Chaouchi was only 23 years of age at the time of the play-off and played in place of suspended [[Lounès Gaouaoui]]. It was only Chaouchi's third cap during the unforgettable night in [[Al Merreikh Stadium]], [[Omdurman]] ([[Sudan]]). In 2010, Chaouchi was known to have been Algeria's highest-paid footballer, earning roughly around 13 million [[Algerian dinar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin Randall |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100913/FOREIGN/709129946/1135/OPINION |title=Algerians in a football league of their own – The National |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaouchi was not employed by an soccer team during the 2013-14 season, and has not been called up by the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian national team]] since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.national-football-teams.com/player/26125/Fawzi_Chaouchi.html#country National-Football-Teams.com, "Fawzi Chaouchi"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Bordj Menaïel|Bordj Ménaïel]],  [[Boumerdès]], Chaouchi was born to Houria and Rachid Chaouchi a former goalkeeper himself that played for [[JS Bordj Ménaïel]].&lt;ref name="lebuteur1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebuteur.com/en/actualites/les-mamans-des-joueurs-revelent-quelques-secrets-de-leur-fils |title=Les mamans des joueurs révèlent quelques secrets de leur fils |publisher=.

According to his mother he abandoned his education in favour of having a career in what he loved most – football, which angered her at the time, but acknowledged that she knew he had a great future ahead of him in football at the time.&lt;ref name="lebuteur1"/&gt;

==Club career==

===JS Bordj Ménaïel===
Chaouchi began his career playing for his hometown club [[JS Bordj Ménaïel]]. He was the captain of the team during the 2005/06 season. His good form that season, conceding just seven goals in 32 games, had begun to create interest from other clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player=296819/profile.html | work=FIFA | title = Faouzi Chaouchi Profile | date = 1 June 2010  | accessdate = 1 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===JS Kabylie===
Chaouchi signed for [[JS Kabylie]] from [[Inter-régions Division|Inter-Régions]] club JS Bordj Ménaïel in 2006. It was confirmed that the goalkeeper was joining after agreeing terms and signing a three-year contract. He was pleased to be joining such a club {{cquote|"It's a childhood dream come true, especially since I have been very well received by the players of JS Kabylie".
|200px||Faouzi Chaouchi&lt;ref name="algerie-dz1"/&gt;}}

He won the [[Algerian Championnat National]] in 2008, which was his greatest achievement as well as the highlight of his  three season spell at the club from 2006 to 2009. He is also remembered by the canary fans for scoring a penalty against [[Cotonsport Garoua]] in the [[CAF Champions League]] with a powerful shot. He was nicknamed “The Canary” by the supporters of the club and is fondly remembered.

Whilst at JS Kabylie, Chaouchi was rumoured to be leaving the club at the end of the season and had talks with various clubs such as [[Lille OSC]], [[ES Sétif]] and [[MC Alger]]. Chaouchi had a string of discipline problems with manager's and the team president since replacing Gaouaoui in the starting line up in the 2007/08 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://boitachemma.blogspot.com/2008/12/daily-fix-belhadj-seals-pompey-move.html | work=Boita Chemma – Algerian Football – It is what it is! | title = Daily Fix: Belhadj Seals Pompey Move | date = 18 November 2009  | accessdate = 18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/reportage/2009/07/27/reportage-01| work=Magharebia News | title = Maghreb mercato shakes up football player, coach rosters | date = 18 November 2009  | accessdate = 18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pesstatsdatabase.com/es-setif/faouzi-chaouchi-t14418.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203132420/http://pesstatsdatabase.com/es-setif/faouzi-chaouchi-t14418.html |date=3 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ES Sétif===
Chaouchi signed for [[ES Sétif]] in June 2009, after the club won the race to recruit the goalkeeper who was known for his outstanding performances at [[JS Kabylie]], where he had shown his abilities and his dramatic shot stopping. He was also known for his extrovert humour prior to making his move to [[ES Sétif]].

In December 2009, Chaouchi helped his side win the North African Cup of Champions tournament by beating [[ES Tunis]] in the final, after a penalty shoot-out. Chaouchi was selected as the best goalkeeper in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footafrique.com/index.php/UNAF/cunaf-metref-et-chaouchi-meilleurs-joueurs.html?e36fbe533e1515e6e02eeb2a9aa1b69e=dac29728c88aa16c73ef7c59f3b4e5a9 |work=Foot Afrique News |title=UNAF : Metref et Chaouchi meilleurs joueurs |date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=18 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015310/http://www.footafrique.com/index.php/UNAF/cunaf-metref-et-chaouchi-meilleurs-joueurs.html?e36fbe533e1515e6e02eeb2a9aa1b69e=dac29728c88aa16c73ef7c59f3b4e5a9 |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 2010, Chaouchi played in the final of the [[Algerian Cup]] (coupe d'Algerie) against [[CA Batna]] by winning 3–0 and helping the club lift the [[Algerian Cup]] for the first time in twenty years and the seventh in their history, with the last being in 1989. The [[Algeria]]n president [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] presented the trophy with the head of state presenting the medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ennaharonline.com/en/sports/3793.html | work=Ennahar Daily Newspaper | title = Bouteflika crowned ESS with its 7th cup | date = 18 November 2009  | accessdate = 18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.elwatan.com/L-ESS-remporte-la-Coupe-d-Algerie | work=El Watan Newspaper | title = L’ESS remporte la Coupe d’Algérie face au CAB (3–0) : L’Entente de Sétif au septième ciel | date = 18 November 2009  | accessdate = 18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmoudjahid.com/en/sports/5066.html |work=El Moudjahid Newspaper |title=Algeria Football Cup 2010: ES Sétif win its 7th title |date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=18 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512051903/http://www.elmoudjahid.com/en/sports/5066.html |archivedate=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a number of European clubs had shown an interest in Chaouchi, predominantly [[Olympique de Marseille]]. In 2010, during an interview a few days after the win against [[CA Batna]] in the [[Algerian Cup]] final he was asked if he had received any new offers from clubs abroad, he replied by confirming that his agent had been informed that representatives from [[Olympique de Marseille]] will be attending the friendly between the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in Dublin on 28 May 2010 to have another look at him. whilst also confirming that he is still in contact with French club [[Le Mans]] since the previous transfer window. He also confirmed he had just received a proposal from a club in the gulf, but didn't want to mention the club as he had no interest in joining any Arabian clubs as he wanted to join an ambitious club based in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lebuteur.com/en/actualites/chaouchi-seul-saadane-peut-decider-qui-sera-le-gardien-numero-1 |work=Le Buteur |title=Chaouchi : "Si je pars de Sétif, ça sera uniquement pour l’étranger" |date=3 May 2010 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505140759/http://www.lebuteur.com/en/actualites/chaouchi-seul-saadane-peut-decider-qui-sera-le-gardien-numero-1 |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2010, there were reports that Chaouchi was involved in a car accident. These reports were verified, stating that Chaouchi was involved in a minor car accident whilst visiting family and friends in his home-town [[Bordj Menaïel|Bordj Ménaïel]]. According to the reports he did not sustain any serious injuries, but the car was damaged beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kobo |first=Kingsley |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/89/africa/2010/10/19/2173369/algeria-goalkeeper-fawzi-chaouchi-in-safe-condition-after |title=Algeria Goalkeeper Fawzi Chaouchi in Safe Condition After Car Accident |publisher=Goal.com |date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 November, the Ligue National de football disciplinary committee decided to give a one match ban to Chaouchi, and a fine of 20.000,00 [[Algerian dinar]]s along with [[Khaled Lemmouchia]] for contesting the decision of the penalty against [[AS Khroub]], which ended 3–3. He was suspended for the game against [[MC Oran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnf.dz/article.php?titre=650&amp;lang=0 |title=LFP – Ligue de Football Professionnelle |publisher=Lnf.dz |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ennaharonline.com/en/ |title=Ennahar Online |publisher=Ennahar Online |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MC Alger===
On 19 July 2011, Chaouchi joined [[MC Alger]], signing a one-year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dzfoot.com/news-9541/transferts-fawzi-chaouchi-rejoint-le-mc-alger/ |title=Transferts : Fawzi Chaouchi rejoint le MC Alger |publisher=Dzfoot.com |date=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721010253/http://www.dzfoot.com/news-9541/transferts-fawzi-chaouchi-rejoint-le-mc-alger/ |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Chaouchi flew to Turkey to negotiate contract offers with newly promoted [[Süper Lig]] clubs  [[Elazığspor]] and [[Kasımpaşa S.K.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebuteur.com/ligue-1/actualites/mca-chaouchi-na-pas-trouve-un-terrain-dentente-avec-elazig-sport-et-kasimpasa |title=MCA : Chaouchi n’a pas trouvé un terrain d’entente avec Elazig Sport et Kasimpasa |publisher=.

==International career==
Chaouchi received his first call-up to the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian national team]] on 4 February 2008 for training which was due to be held in France, after his good form for club [[JS Kabylie]] did not go unnoticed by the national team coach [[Rabah Saâdane|Saâdane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dzfoot.com/news-3023.php |title=EN : Point de presse de Saâdane ce samedi |publisher=Dzfoot.Com |date=29 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201073209/http://www.dzfoot.com/news-3023.php |archivedate=1 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2008, he made his debut for [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in a friendly against [[DR Congo national football team|DR Congo]] coming on as a substitute at half-time for [[Lounès Gaouaoui]].

On 18 November 2009, Chaouchi was selected to play fierce rivals [[Egypt]] in what was to be the most important game of his football career, the reward being the remaining African place for the 2010 World Cup finals as first-choice goalkeeper [[Lounès Gaouaoui]] was ruled out through suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/preview?id=285045&amp;cc=5739 |title=Preview: Algeria v Egypt – World Cup Qualifying – CAF – ESPN FC |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/18/algeria-egypt-live-world-cup-playoff | work=The Guardian Newspaper| title = World Cup play-off: Algeria v Egypt – as it happened | date = 18 November 2009  | accessdate = 18 November 2009 | location=London | first=Paolo | last=Bandini}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1863/world-cup-2010/2009/11/17/1630176/world-cup-qualifying-preview-egypt-algeria |title=World Cup Qualifying Preview: Egypt – Algeria |publisher=Goal.com |date=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8367431.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Yahia sends Algeria to World Cup | date=18 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaouchi put in a heroic performance in the play-off as he constantly denied [[Egypt]] to send Algeria through to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], with the final score being 1–0 with centre-back Antar Yahia scoring the only goal with a stunning first-half volley at an angle eight yards out from Karim Ziani's punt into the box. After his heroic performance Chaouchi gave [[Rabah Saâdane|Saâdane]] something to think about whilst preparing for the [[2010 African Cup of Nations]].

In December 2009, Chaouchi was selected by [[Rabah Saâdane|Saâdane]] to play in the [[2010 African Cup of Nations]] hosted in Angola. He was normally regarded as second-choice goalkeeper under coach [[Rabah Saâdane]], who had been using [[Lounès Gaouaoui]] as his first-choice goalkeeper,
but due to Chaouchi's heroic performance in [[Khartoum]] and [[Lounès Gaouaoui]] withdrawing from the [[2010 African Cup of Nations]] due to an attack of acute [[appendicitis]], [[Rabah Saâdane]] did not hesitate in using Chaouchi as first-choice goalkeeper in the [[2010 African Cup of Nations]]. Chaouchi's sending off in the semi-final against Egypt for receiving two cautions along with his head-butting of referee [[Coffi Codjia]] saw him earn a suspension for 3 matches and $10,000 fine from CAF.

'''Frank George Wisner II''' (born July 2, 1938) is an American businessman and former diplomat. He is the son of CIA official [[Frank Wisner]] (1909–1965). On January 31, 2011, he was sent to Egypt by President [[Barack Obama]] to negotiate a resolution to the [[2011 Egyptian protests|popular protests]] against the regime that had swept the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2011/jan/31/egypt-protests-live-updates |title=Egypt protests – Monday 31 January |work=The Guardian |date=January 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A White House spokesman said that Wisner had vast experience in the region as well as close relationships with many Egyptians in and out of government. The New York Times reports that he is a personal friend of Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/world/middleeast/02transition.html |title=Obama Urges Mubarak Not to Run Again |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the BBC on February 5, 2011, he exceeded statements issued by the White House to date and insisted that President Mubarak should be allowed to remain in office despite widespread calls for him to step down.

He works as an international-affairs advisor at the firm of [[Squire Patton Boggs]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank G. Wisner|url=http://www.squirepattonboggs.com/professionals/w/wisner-frank-g|publisher=Squire Patton Boggs|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Wisner was born in New York on July 2, 1938.&lt;ref name="wharton-bio"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.whartonglobal.com/wgbf2003/india/wisner.asp |title= Frank G.

In 1976, at the beginning of the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, he served under [[Cyrus Vance]] as Deputy [[Executive Secretariat|Executive Secretary]] of the Department of State. Among his overseas assignments, Wisner served as the United States Ambassador to [[Zambia]] (1979–82); [[Egypt]] (1986–91), the [[Philippines]] (1991–92), and [[United States Ambassador to India|India]], 1994–97.

During his tenure in Lusaka he played the role of point man for the Constructive Engagement policy of assistant secretary of state for African affairs Chester Crocker. Wisner worked well with Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda and helped to rebuild bilateral relations between Zambia and the USA after a 1980 spy scandal at the U.S. embassy in Lusaka. Crocker's efforts contributed to the organization and successful discussions at the February 1984 Lusaka Conference regarding conflicts in Angola and Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;Andy DeRoche, ''Kenneth Kaunda, the United States and Southern Africa'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016), 150-151, 168-170, and 192-196.&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from government service in 1997, Wisner joined the board at a subsidiary of [[Enron]], the former energy company and served on the board of [[American International Group]] (AIG).

In late 2002, Wisner co-chaired an independent working group which developed a model for the US's post-conflict role in Iraq, should an invasion occur. Their published recommendations included: establishment of law and order through the retraining of the Iraqi army, focusing on the distribution of humanitarian assistance and reestablishment of vital services, and the importance of avoiding the appointment of exiled Iraqi opposition leaders to dominant positions in the new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bakerinstitute.org/programs/energy-forum/publications/docs/GuidingPrinciples_USPostConflictPolicy_Iraq.pdf/view?searchterm=wisner |title=Guiding Principles for U.S. Post-Conflict Policy in Iraq |publisher=James A. Baker Institute For Public Policy at Rice University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisner is an advisory board member for the [[Partnership for a Secure America]], a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. In 2012 he succeeded [[Paul A. Volcker]] as chairman of the board of trustees of [[International House of New York|International House]], a cultural-exchange residence and program center in New York City. He also serves on the advisory board of the [[National Security Network]], and on the board of [[Refugees International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refugeesinternational.org/press-room/press-release/release-refugees-international-welcomes-new-board-members |title=Press Release |publisher=Refugees International |date=May 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to become a member of the board for EOG Resources. In June 2013, Wisner joined the advisory board of Ergo, a global intelligence and advisory firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ambassador-frank-g-wisner-joins-ergos-advisory-board-211002551.html |title= Ambassador Frank G.

==2011 Egypt protests==
In early 2011, the Obama administration asked Wisner to carry views to Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, including advice that Mubarak should resign to defuse the crisis.{{vague|date=October 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Frank Wisner, the Diplomat Sent to Prod Mubarak |first=Sjeryl Gay| last= Stolberg  |date=February 2, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/world/middleeast/03wisner.html?_r=1 |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisner was unsuccessful in convincing Mubarak to do so. Four days later, after a day in which Mubarak allies took violent reprisal against democracy activists, Wisner spoke to a security conference in Europe and called it "crucial" that Mubarak stay on in the interest of "stability". The State Department immediately disavowed his comments and said Wisner had not been serving as an envoy but as a conduit for certain administration views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/world/middleeast/06egypt.html?hp |title=West Backs Gradual Egyptian Transition |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James William "Jim" Denver''' (October 23, 1817 – August 9, 1892) was an American politician, soldier and lawyer. He served in the California state government, as an officer in the [[United States Army]] in two wars, and as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from California. He served as secretary and Governor of the [[Kansas Territory]] during the struggle over whether or not [[Kansas]] would be open to [[slavery]]. The city of [[Denver]], Colorado, is named after him.

==Early life and career==
James W. Denver was born near [[Winchester, Virginia]]. He attended public schools and moved to [[Ohio]] with his parents in 1830, settling near [[Wilmington, Ohio|Wilmington]]. In 1841 he taught school in [[Missouri]], and in 1844 he graduated from the law school of the [[University of Cincinnati]]. He was admitted to the bar and practiced law near [[Xenia, Ohio]]. He moved to [[Platte City, Missouri]], in 1845, where he continued his law practice and acting career.

In 1847, during the [[Mexican–American War]], he recruited a company for the 12th U.S. Volunteer Infantry and was commissioned a [[captain (United States)|captain]], serving under General [[Winfield Scott]]. After the war in 1850, Denver traveled to California, where he became a trader. Denver killed newspaper editor [[Edward Gilbert]] in a [[duel]] on August 2, 1852. Later that same year, he was elected to the [[California State Senate]]. He was later appointed as [[California Secretary of State|Secretary of State of California]]. In 1854 he was elected to the [[United States Congress]] as representative from California, serving from March 4, 1855 – March 3, 1857. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1856. On April 17, 1857, President [[James Buchanan]] appointed him as [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Commissioner of Indian Affairs]].

On June 17, 1857, Denver was appointed by Buchanan as Secretary of the Kansas Territory. In December 1857 he was appointed as Territorial Governor.  On the day that Denver assumed the territorial governorship, citizens in the territory voted on the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which opened the territory to slavery. The vote offered a choice only between full slavery and limited slavery in the territory and was thus largely boycotted by [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Stater]]s who were in favor of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing slavery]].  The pro-slavery constitution passed by an overwhelming margin.  Later it was discovered that several thousand votes were cast fraudulently by "[[Border Ruffian]]s" who had crossed into the territory from [[Missouri]] in order to cast pro-slavery ballots (The vote was overturned by a subsequent election in August 1858, and Kansas was later admitted to the Union, in 1861, as a [[slave and free states|free state]]. See [[Bleeding Kansas]] for details.).

[[File:GenJohnWDenver.jpg|thumb|left|200px|General James W. Denver]]
In November 1858, while Denver was still serving as territorial governor, [[William Larimer, Jr.]], a land speculator from [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]], planted the townsite of "[[Denver, Colorado|Denver City]]" along the [[South Platte River]] in Arapaho County in western [[Kansas Territory]] (the present-day state of [[Colorado]]).  Larimer chose the name "Denver" to honor the current territorial governor with the intention that the city would be chosen as the county seat of Arapaho County.  It was actually William McGaa and William Larimer who got the settlement of St. Charles at the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River to change its name to Denver in hope of becoming the county seat.

Denver retired as territorial governor in November 1858 and was reappointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs, serving until his resignation on March 31, 1859.

==Civil War and later career==
A few months after the start of the [[American Civil War]] in early 1861, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] commissioned Denver a brigadier general in the volunteer army on August 14. In November 1861, he was ordered to report to [[Fort Scott National Historic Site|Fort Scott]] in Kansas and in December, he assumed command of all Federal troops in Kansas. During March and April 1862 he commanded the [[Department of Kansas#1861|District of Kansas]] until he was transferred to the [[Army of the Tennessee|District of West Tennessee]].  On 16 May 1862, Denver assumed command of the 3rd Brigade/5th Division under Maj. Gen. [[William T. Sherman]] in the midst of the [[Siege of Corinth]].  The very next day Denver's brigade participated in the [[Siege of Corinth#Russell's House|fight for Russell's House]].  Though his brigade suffered no casualties in this engagement it was nonetheless one of the two brigades leading the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=zpojUprtDKasigL6uYHwAg&amp;id=1bB2AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Battle+of+Russell+House+Mississippi&amp;q=russell%27s+house#v=snippet&amp;q=russell%27s%20house&amp;f=false Sherman's Report p.137]&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 27 General Sherman again selected Denver's brigade to be one of the leading units in an [[Siege of Corinth#Double Log House|attack against the Double Log House]].  Denver and [[Morgan L. Smith]]'s brigade successfully stormed the [[log cabin]] turned [[block house]]. During this engagement Major General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was present on the battlefield and indicated his approval of the handsome manner in which the troops behaved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4361/4361-h/4361-h.htm Sherman's Memoirs]&lt;/ref&gt;  After the fall of Corinth Denver continued in command of his brigade, serving on garrison duty in Mississippi.  During the early stages of the [[Vicksburg Campaign]] Denver was in command of the 1st Division, [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]] until his resignation from the Union Army on March 5, 1863.

After the war, Denver practiced law in Washington, D.C., and [[Wilmington, Ohio]]; he and his family lived in the [[Rombach Place]] while residing in Wilmington.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Albert J., ed.  ''History of Clinton County Ohio: Its People, Industries, and Institutions''.  [[Indianapolis]]: Bowen, 1915, 561.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a delegate to the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] National Convention in 1876, 1880, and 1884. He was mentioned as a possible Democratic presidential nominee in 1876 and 1884, although his name was never offered into formal nomination.

Denver reportedly visited [[Denver]], Colorado in 1875 and 1882, but complained that his visits received little affection from the residents of the city named after him.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Brown (1985) ''The Great Pikes Peak Gold Rush'', Caldwell, Ida.: Caxton, p.64&lt;/ref&gt; The second visit makes Denver the only person to have spent time in his or her namesake city after it became a U.S. state capital.

He died in Washington, D.C. in 1892 and is buried in Sugar Grove Cemetery in [[Wilmington, Ohio]].

His son, [[Matthew R. Denver]], was a [[U.S. Congressman]] from Ohio from 1907–1913.

'''Jeremy James Synot''' (born 7 July 1988) is a former Australian wheelchair basketball player and current National Wheelchair Basketball League Head Coach of the RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets.

==Early life==
Synot was born in [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] to parents Donna and Paul. He is the 3rd eldest of 3 boys and 3 girls.

Synot was born with a rare condition known as [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]] or Brittle Bones Disease (Type IV), which meant he was prone to bone fractures from a young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/breaks-toughen-donna-synot-and-her-family/story-e6frf7kx-1225864247183/ |title=Breaks toughen Donna Synot and her family |publisher=[[Herald Sun]] |accessdate=14 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early years of life, preventative surgeries were undertaken to limit severity and frequency of fractures; particularly in his right femur. He has 2 siblings who also suffer from the rare bone condition.

==Education==

Synot attended [[Greenvale Primary School]] from 1994 – 2000 and completed his [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] at [[Penola Catholic College]] from 2001 – 2006. He was taught  P.E  by former Richmond and West Coast AFL/VFL player [[Richard Geary]].

In 2010, he achieved an undergraduate degree in [[Health Science]] at [[Monash University]]. In 2014, he completed a graduate diploma in Middle Years Education at the [[Queensland University of Technology]].

==Wheelchair Tennis==

Synot started his sporting career as a junior [[wheelchair tennis]] player at Kingsville Tennis Club, 10 minutes west of Melbourne’s CBD. He was a consistent performer achieving semi final placings at the Bendigo Open in 2001 and 2002. Synot competed in the junior doubles at the 2001 [[Australian Open]] where he was partnered with longtime friend and Australian Tennis representative Ben Beare to reach the final. Beare and Synot were defeated in the final by Heath Davidson and 2015 Australian Wheelchair Open Quad Singles Champion [[Dylan Alcott]] in a 3rd-set tiebreaker.

==Wheelchair Basketball: Playing career==

Synot took a break until 2007 to focus on school and university before a chance interaction with former doubles partner Ben Beare led him back into sport.

Synot played [[wheelchair basketball]] for 9 months before being selected to play for Victoria at the 2007 Junior Nationals, held in [[Narrabeen, New South Wales|Narrabeen]], [[New South Wales]]. He would go on to play a consistent tournament before breaking his arm in the semi final against Western Australia. Victoria would go on to win the game before losing in the final to tournament favourites – New South Wales. Synot was named to play for Australia in the junior representative game against the USA.

Synot made the jump in 2008 to play in the [[National Wheelchair Basketball League (Australia)|NWBL]] competition with the [[Dandenong Rangers]]. Dandenong would go on to finish 4th that season with Synot playing every game.

In 2009, Synot played few minutes for the entirety of the season due to inconsistent form and a deep roster. Synot narrowly missed out on a spot in the U23’s Australian Team who competed in the 2009 U23 IWBF World Championships. The team would go on to finish fourth in Paris, France.

In 2010, Synot under new coach Brett Paxton had an impact at times coming off the bench in a mid pointer rotation. Dandenong would achieve a third placing in the league that season.

Driven by narrow misses and lack of opportunities, Synot worked hard and forged a spot in the team for the 2011 season. His first 4 games showed improvement averaging 7.5 ppg, 3.3 apg and 1.2 rpg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/team_info.cgi?c=0-4219-72987-165024-8843555&amp;a=STATS/ |title=2011 NWBL Team Stats |publisher=SportingPulse |accessdate=14 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synot was also awarded with an MVP at the Albury Wodonga State Tournament and was a member of the All Star 5 in the Basketball Australia Frank Ponta Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsr.org.au/news1.aspx?ArticleID=171/ |title=DSR Members shine at A.I.S Awards |publisher=Disability Sport and Recreation |accessdate=14 April 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Synot broke his right femur, which sidelined him for the rest of the season.

In 2012, Synot would make the switch to the RSL Queensland Brisbane Bullets. He would go on to have a serviceable year averaging 4 points per 11 minutes game time throughout the season.

Synot announced his retirement at the end of the 2012 season, citing injury as the reason.

==Coaching career: NWBL==

Synot received an offer to become the assistant coach of the Queensland Juniors Wheelchair Basketball Team in 2013. He was promoted mid year with a role as technical coach across the Queensland National League Program. The RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets would go on to finish 3rd in that season.

In 2014, Synot was offered the opportunity to coach the RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/news/517-spinning-bullets-set-to-roll-into-new-look-nwbl-/ |title=Spinning Bullets set to roll in new-look NWBL |publisher=Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association |accessdate=14 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415032616/http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/news/517-spinning-bullets-set-to-roll-into-new-look-nwbl-/ |archivedate=15 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets finished 2nd in the regular season and advanced through to the Championship game defeating home side Perth Wheelcats by 3 points. Perth Wheelcats would go on to make the final through a semi final and reverse the results on the Sunday and be crowned Champions for the 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/news/570-silver-for-spinning-bullets-in-nwbl-final |title=Silver for Spinning Bullets in NWBL final |publisher=Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association |accessdate=14 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317184755/http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/news/570-silver-for-spinning-bullets-in-nwbl-final |archivedate=17 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the third time the RSL Queensland Spinning Bullets were runners up in the NWBL competition history.

Synot was awarded Coach of the Year in the NWBL for the 2014 season in his rookie year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://wheelchairsportswa.org.au/a-record-8th-nwbl-championship-for-the-be-active-perth-wheelcats/ |title=Be Active Perth Wheelcats are 2014 NWBL Champions |publisher=Wheelchair Sports Western Australia |accessdate=14 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International coaching==

In November 2014, Synot was selected by Australian Coach [[Ben Ettridge]] as a development coach to tour Kitakyushu, Japan where the team would claim 3rd place in the competition.

==Personal==

Synot is an avid golfer and is prominent supporter of the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]]. He also has strong ties to horse racing through childhood friend and ex [[Melbourne Cup]] winning jockey, [[Greg Hall (jockey)|Greg Hall]]

Synot is currently vice-president of not-for-profit organisation [[Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/about-us/corporate-governance |title=Corporate Governance |publisher=Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association |accessdate=14 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as a board member since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/news/400-basketballer-appointed-to-board |title=Basketball appointed to board |publisher=Sporting Wheelies and Disabled Association |accessdate=14 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326141740/http://www.sportingwheelies.org.au/news/400-basketballer-appointed-to-board |archivedate=26 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph-Alphonse Esménard''' (1770, [[Pélissanne]] – 25 June 1811, [[Fondi]]) was a French poet and the brother of the journalist [[Jean-Baptiste Esménard]].

==Biography==
An editor of Royalist newspapers, Esménard left France after 10 August 1792 and travelled throughout Europe, going to England, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, [[Constantinople]] and Greece. Returning to Paris in 1797, he wrote for ''[[La Quotidienne]]'' but was forced to emgirate again after [[18 Fructidor]], not without first spending two months in the  [[Prison du Temple]]. He returned to France again after [[18 Brumaire]], but soon afterwards left for [[Saint-Domingue]] as secretary to general [[Charles Victor Emmanuel Leclerc|Leclerc]] on the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]]. On his return from the expedition, he was made head of the bureau des théâtres under the interior minister thanks to the protection of  [[Anne Jean Marie René Savary|Savary]]. Soon after this, however, he left once again to follow admiral [[Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse|Villaret de Joyeuse]] to [[Martinique]].

Esménard then came back to France for good, where he received favours from the [[First French Empire|imperial]] government for services rendered - censor of theatres and libraries, censor of the ''[[Journal de l'Empire]]'' and chef de division to the ministry of police. In 1810, he was elected to the [[Académie française]].

For having published a satirical article against one of Napoleon's envoys to Russia in the ''Journal de l'Empire'', he was exiled to Italy for a few months. On his return trip he died in a carriage accident at [[Fondi]], near [[Naples]].

==Works==
Esménard is best known for the didactic and descriptive poem entitled ''La Navigation'', first published in 8 verses in 1805, then re-edited to 6 verses in 1806. It is a precise work, drawn from observations made by the author in the course of his travels. Its versification, however, is monotonous and it is marked by a total absence of action and movement.

Esménard wrote ''Le triomphe de Trajan'', a three-act opera with music by [[Jean-François Lesueur]], on the life of [[Trajan]] but full of flattering allusions to [[Napoleon I of France]]. It was produced to triumphal reviews in 1807. He also wrote the three-act opera ''[[Fernand Cortez]] ou la conquête du Mexique'' (1809) in collaboration with [[Victor-Joseph-Étienne de Jouy]], with music by [[Gaspare Spontini]]. This too proved very successful. He also wrote several verses to the glory of Napoleon, collected as ''La Couronne poétique de Napoléon'' (1807).

'''José Domingo Duquesne''' ([[Bogotá]], 23 February 1748 - idem, 30 August 1822) was a [[Colombia]]n [[clergyman]], [[theologist]], [[scientist]] and writer. [[Polyglot]] Duquesne spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[Classical Greek|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]].&lt;ref name=Banco&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/biografias/duqujose.htm Biography José Domingo Duquesne] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
José Domingo Duquesne was born on February 23, 1748 in Bogotá, then the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. His parents were [[French people|Frenchman]] Juan Francisco Duquesne, originally from [[Montpellier]], and Clara Ignacia de la Madrid, from Bogotá.&lt;ref name=Banco/&gt; He attended the ''Colegio Mayor y Seminario de San Bartolomé'' graduating in 1774 in [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] and [[theology]]. Remarkable for his day and studies, during his dissertation on [[philosophy]] Duquesne treated the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref name=Banco/&gt;

From 1775 to 1795 Duquesne was assigned to the [[indigenous peoples of Colombia|indigenous]] villages [[Lenguazaque]] and [[Gachancipá]] and studied [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]], the language of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]]. This was the first recorded study of the almost extinct language as education in the language was forbidden by the authorities of the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1577 and in 1638 the last bilingual school was closed.&lt;ref name=Banco/&gt; After ten years of service in Lenguazaque, as of July 13, 1785 Duquesne was working in the parrochy of the church in Gachancipá.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.colombiaturismoweb.com/DEPARTAMENTOS/CUNDINAMARCA/MUNICIPIOS/GACHANCIPA/GACHANCIPA.htm Duquesne in Gachancipá]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zerda, 1882, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795 Duquesne published his work ''Disertación sobre el calendario de los muyscas, indios naturales de este Nuevo Reino de Granada'' ("Dissertation about the calendar of the Muyscas [sic], native indians of this New Kingdom of Granada"). In this work he unraveled the complex [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] [[Muisca calendar]]. José Celestino Mutis handed Duquesne's work over to the famous natural scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] who visited the Colombian territories in 1801.&lt;ref name=Banco/&gt;

After publishing his work on the Muisca calendar, the [[Muisca numerals]] and grammar of the Chibcha language, Duquesne was appointed [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of the cathedral of Bogotá, by [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], the [[King of Spain]] in 1800. To the capital and his birthplace he took his knowledge about the language and calendar of the Muisca together with an interpretation of the until then uncyphered [[:fr:Ælia Lælia Crispis]].&lt;ref name=Banco/&gt;

Duquesne retired in 1819 and died on August 30, 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Zerda, 1882, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lawrence Elgin Glendenin''' (November 8, 1918{{spaced ndash}}November 22, 2008) was an [[Americans|American]] [[chemist]] who co-discovered the [[chemical element|element]] [[promethium]].

==Biography==
Glendenin was born in [[Bay City, Michigan]] on November 8, 1918. He attended the [[University of Chicago]], graduating in 1941.&lt;ref name=CTobit&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/chicagotribune/Obituaries.asp?Page=LifeStory&amp;PersonId=120864193 Dr. Lawrence Elgin Glendenin] (obituary), ''Chicago Tribune'', December 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinton Laboratories==
He worked as a chemist at the Clinton Laboratories (now [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]) during the [[World War II]] [[Manhattan Project]], engaged in separating, identifying and characterizing the [[radioactive]] elements produced by [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref name=CTobit/&gt; In 1945, he, together with [[Jacob A. Marinsky]] and [[Charles D. Coryell]], isolated the previously undocumented [[rare-earth element]] 61.&lt;ref name=ORNLReview&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/v36_1_03/article_02.shtml Reactor Chemistry – Discovery of Promethium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706071605/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/v36_1_03/article_02.shtml |date=2015-07-06 }}, ''ORNL Review'', Vol. 36, No. 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Marinsky and Glendenin produced promethium both by extraction from fission products and by bombarding [[neodymium]] with [[neutron]]s.&lt;ref name=ORNLReview/&gt;&lt;ref name=time1947/&gt; They isolated it using [[ion-exchange chromatography]].&lt;ref name=ORNLReview/&gt; Publication of the finding was delayed until later due to the war. In September 1947, Marinsky and Glendenin announced the discovery at a meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob A. Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin, Charles D. Coryell: "The Chemical Identification of Radioisotopes of Neodymium and of Element 61", ''[[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]'', '''1947''', ''69''&amp;nbsp;(11), pp.&amp;nbsp;2781–2785; {{DOI|10.1021/ja01203a059}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time1947&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804273,00.html Nervous Elements], Time magazine, September 29, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the suggestion of Coryell's wife, the team named the new element for the titan [[Prometheus]], who stole fire from the gods and was punished for the act by [[Zeus]].&lt;ref name=ORNLReview/&gt; They had also considered naming it "clintonium" for the facility where it was isolated.&lt;ref name=ORNLReview2002&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter2sb6.htm Promethium Unbound: A New Element] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206022448/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter2sb6.htm |date=2008-12-06 }}, ''ORNL Review'' Vol. 35, Nos. 3 and 4, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Szilárd petition==
In 1945, Glendenin and 154 other Manhattan Project scientists signed the [[Szilárd petition]]. The petition urged President [[Harry S. Truman]] not to use the first [[atomic bomb]] "without restriction", urging him instead to "describe and demonstrate" its power and give [[Japan]] "the opportunity to consider the consequences of further refusal to surrender".&lt;ref name=CTobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mphpa.org/classic/HISTORY/H-07g.htm Oak Ridge petition, mid-July 1945], The Manhattan Project Heritage Preservation Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gest&gt;Howard Gest, [http://www.bio.indiana.edu/~gest/hgSzilard.pdf The July 1945 Szilard Petition on the Atomic Bomb; Memoir by a signer in Oak Ridge], Indiana University of Pennsylvania, accessed December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late career==
In 1949, Glendenin earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. That same year he joined [[Argonne National Laboratory]], where he remained until his retirement in 1985.&lt;ref name=CTobit/&gt;

He published extensively on the properties of [[fission product]]s. He served as Scientific Secretary on the U.S. delegation to the [[Atoms for Peace Conference]]&lt;ref name=CTobit/&gt; and received the [[American Chemical Society]]'s [[Glenn T. Seaborg Award for Nuclear Chemistry]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webapps.acs.org/findawards/detail.jsp?ContentId=CTP_004529 Glenn T. Seaborg Award for Nuclear Chemistry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724223316/http://webapps.acs.org/findawards/detail.jsp?ContentId=CTP_004529 |date=2011-07-24 }}, American Chemical Society website, accessed December 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and death==
Glendenin was married for 63 years to Ethel Glendenin (née Long), who survived him at his death in November 2008. The couple were the parents of two daughters and one son.&lt;ref name=CTobit/&gt;

[[Priyayi|Kanjeng Raden Ayu]] '''Soemarini Soerjosoemarno''', now known as '''Abdullah Burhan Marini''' or simply '''Marini''' or '''Marini Sardi''' (born 2 November 1947) is an Indonesian singer and actress who has performed on stage and TV screens since the 1960s. She was born to Indonesian father Kanjeng Raden Mas Arjo Soetarjo Soerjosoemarno and Dutch mother Dolly Zegerius. She has recorded dozens of albums, both recorded in Indonesia and abroad for Polydor, Philips and EMI.

==Biography==
Marini was born in [[Malang]], [[East Java]], on 2 November 1947, the daughter of a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] nobleman, Kanjeng Raden Mas Arjo Soetarjo Soerjosoemarno, and a Dutch-Jewish woman,&lt;ref&gt;https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/42191430&lt;/ref&gt; Dolly Zegerius.&lt;ref name="JP1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/09/16/guesswhat-marini-soerjosoemarno.html|title=Guess what?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the lead-up to the [[GANEFO|Games of the New Emerging Forces]], when her uncle bought her the opportunity to sing two songs on [[TVRI]]. She found popularity with the audience, and was given more songs to sing.&lt;ref name="TIM"/&gt; By 1967 Marini had become a professional singer, touring with The Steps. With the band, she travelled through East Asia, including [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Tokyo]]. In the latter city she took a beauty course.&lt;ref name="TIM"/&gt;

Marini made her film debut in 1975 with ''[[Cinta (film)|Cinta]]''. At the 1976 [[Indonesian Film Festival]], she was voted the best new talent.&lt;ref name="Biran1979"/&gt; She continued her career with such films as ''Kenangan Desember'' (1976), ''Marina'' (1977), ''Terminal Cinta'' (1977), and ''Sejuta Duka Ibu'' (1977).&lt;ref name="Biran1979"/&gt;

In 1994 Marini interviewed [[Julio Iglesias]] and performed "[[Let It Be Me (The Everly Brothers song)|Let It Be Me]]" with him.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 2003 she was a supporting actress in the ''sinetron'' (soap opera) ''Doa dan Anugerah 2''.&lt;ref name="Suara Merdeka"/&gt; She returned to film in 2007 for [[Hanung Bramantyo]]'s ''[[Ayat-Ayat Cinta]]'', acting in two further movies in 2010.&lt;ref name="TIM"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Marini had two children with her first husband Didi A. Haju, a singer with The Pro's. Their second child, Shelomita Sulistiany (b. 26 November 1974), is also a singer.&lt;ref name="Suara Merdeka"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Berani Menikah Lagi |trans-title=Willing to Marry Again |date=9 December 2003 |work=Suara Merdeka |language=Indonesian |url=http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0312/09/bud5.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XOQVlH0z?url=http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0312/09/bud5.htm |archivedate=29 March 2015 |accessdate=29 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JP2"/&gt; Her second marriage was to the racer Tinton Suprapto.&lt;ref name="Suara Merdeka"/&gt;

The '''Marsh Arabs''' ({{lang-ar|عرب الأهوار}} ''ʻArab al-Ahwār'' "Arabs of the Marshlands"), also referred to as the '''Maʻdān''' ({{lang-ar|معدان}} "dweller in the plains") or '''shroog''' ({{lang-ar|شروگ}}, "those from the east")—the latter two often considered derogatory in the present day—are inhabitants of the [[Mesopotamian Marshes|Tigris-Euphrates marshlands]] in the south and east of [[Iraq]] as well as in the [[Hoveyzieh]] marshes of Southwest [[Iran]].

Comprising members of many different tribes and tribal confederations, such as the Āl Bū Muḥammad, Ferayghāt, Shaghanbah and Banī Lām, the Maʻdān had developed a unique culture centered on the marshes' natural resources. Many of the marshes' inhabitants were displaced when the wetlands were [[Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes#Gulf War Draining|drained]] during and after the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]].

==Culture==
[[File:Iraqi mudhif interior.jpg|thumb|200px|The interior of an Iraqi ''[[mudhif]]'']]

The term Maʻdān was used disparagingly by desert tribes to refer to those inhabiting the Iraqi river basins, as well as by those who farmed in the river basins to refer to the population of the marshes.&lt;ref name=thesigerp58&gt;[[Wilfred Thesiger]], ''The Marsh Arabs'', Penguin, 1967, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maʻdān speak a local variety of [[Mesopotamian Arabic]] and traditionally wore a variant of normal Arab dress: for males, a ''[[thawb]]'' ("long shirt"; in recent times, occasionally with a Western-style jacket over the top) and a ''[[keffiyeh]]'' ("headcloth") worn twisted around the head in a [[turban]], as few could afford an ''[[Agal (accessory)|ʻiqāl]]''.

===Agriculture===
The society of the Marsh Arabs was divided into two main groups by occupation. One group bred and raised [[water buffalo]] while others cultivated [[agriculture|crops]] such as [[rice]], [[barley]], [[wheat]] and [[pearl millet]]; they also kept some [[sheep]] and [[cattle]]. Rice cultivation was especially important; it was carried out in small plots cleared in April and sown in mid-May. Cultivation seasons were marked by the rising and setting of certain stars, such as the [[Pleiades]] and [[Sirius]].&lt;ref name=thesigerp174&gt;Thesiger, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

Some branches of the Maʻdān were [[nomads|nomadic]] [[pastoralism|pastoralists]], erecting temporary dwellings and moving buffalo around the marshes according to the season. Some fishing, especially of species of [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]] (notably the [[binni]] or ''bunni'', ''Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi''), was practised using spears and [[datura]] poison, but large-scale fishing using nets was until recent times regarded as a dishonourable profession by the Maʻdān and was mostly carried out by a separate low-status tribe known as the ''Berbera''.&lt;ref name=Thesigerp92&gt;Thesiger, p.92&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, however, up to 60% of the total amount of fish caught in Iraq's inland waters came from the marshes.&lt;ref&gt;[[USAID]] [http://www.iraqmarshes.org/Documents/Final%20Report/IRAQ%20MARSHLANDS-Chapter%209.pdf Iraq Marshlands Restoration Program Final Report, Chapter 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021041856/http://www.iraqmarshes.org/Documents/Final%20Report/IRAQ%20MARSHLANDS-Chapter%209.pdf |date=2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later twentieth century a third main occupation entered Marsh Arab life; the [[weaving]] of reed mats on a commercial scale. Though they often earned far more than workers in [[agriculture]], weavers were looked down upon by both Maʻdān and farmers alike: however, financial concerns meant that it gradually gained acceptance as a respectable profession.

===Religion===
The majority of Marsh Arabs are [[Twelver]] Shiʿi Muslims, though in the marshes small communities of [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]-speaking [[Mandaeans]] (often working as boat builders and craftsmen) live alongside them.&lt;ref name=thesigerp127&gt;Thesiger, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants' long association with tribes within Persia may have influenced the spread of the Shī‘ī denomination within the marshes. [[Wilfred Thesiger]] commented that while he met few Marsh Arabs who had performed the [[Hajj]], many of them had made the pilgrimage to [[Mashhad]] (thereby earning the title ''Zair'');&lt;ref name=thesigerp55&gt;Thesiger, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; a number of families also claimed descent from [[Muhammad]], adopting the title of ''[[sayyid]]'' and [[dyeing]] their ''keffiyeh'' green.

The Maʻdān carried out the majority of their devotions in private as there were no places of worship within the Marshes; some were known to visit [[Ezra's Tomb]], one of the few religious sites of any kind in the area.&lt;ref name=raphaeli&gt;Raphaeli, N. ''[http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=15#_edn7 The Destruction of Iraqi Marshes and Their Revival]'', memri.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
[[File:Marsh Arab.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Marsh Arab]]
As with most tribes of southern Iraq, the main authority was the tribal [[shaikh]]. To this day, the shaikh of a Marsh Arab group will collect a [[tribute]] from his tribe in order to maintain the ''[[mudhif]]'', the tribal guesthouse, which acts as the [[politics|political]], [[society|social]], [[justice|judicial]] and [[religion|religious]] centre of Marsh Arabic life. The ''mudhif'' is used as a place to settle disputes, to carry out [[diplomacy]] with other tribes and as a gathering point for religious and other celebrations. It is also the place where visitors are offered [[hospitality]]. Although the tribal shaykh was the principal figure, each Maʻdān village (which may have contained members of several different tribes) would also follow the authority of the hereditary ''[[qalit]]'' "headman" of a tribe's particular section.

[[Bedouin systems of justice#Blood feud protocols|Blood feuds]], which could only be settled by the ''qalit'', were a feature of Marsh Arab life, in common with that of the Arab [[bedouin]]. Many of the Marsh Arabs' [[Honor codes of the Bedouin|codes of behaviour]] were similar to those of the desert tribes.

[[File:Marsh Arabs in a mashoof.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Marsh Arabs poling a ''mashoof'']]

Most Marsh Arabs lived in arched reed houses considerably smaller than a ''mudhif''. The typical dwelling was usually a little more than two meters wide, about six meters long, and a little less than three meters high, and was either constructed at the waterside or on an artificial [[island]] of reeds called a ''kibasha''; a more permanent island of layered reeds and mud was called a ''dibin''.&lt;ref name=thesigerp75&gt;Thesiger, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; Houses had entrances at both ends and a screen in the middle; one end was used as a dwelling and the other end (sometimes extended with a ''sitra'', a long reed structure) was used to shelter animals in bad weather. A ''raba'' was a higher-status dwelling, distinguished by a north-facing entrance, which also served as a guesthouse where there was no ''mudhif''.&lt;ref name=thesigerp71&gt;Thiesiger, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional boats (the ''[[mashoof]]'' and ''[[tarada]]'') were used as transport: the Maʻdān would drive buffalo through the reedbeds during the season of low water to create channels, which would then be kept open by constant use, for the boats.&lt;ref name=thesigerp70&gt;Thesiger, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

The marsh environment meant that certain diseases, such as [[schistosomiasis]] and [[malaria]], were endemic;&lt;ref name=Thesigerp85&gt;Thesiger, p.85, 108&lt;/ref&gt; Maʻdānī agriculture and homes were also vulnerable to periodic droughts and flooding.

===Origin theories===
The origins of the Maʻdān are still a matter of some interest. [[British Empire|British colonial]] ethnographers found it difficult to classify some of the Maʻdān's social customs and speculated that they might have originated in [[India]].&lt;ref name=colep10&gt;Cole, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have proposed historical and genetic links between the Marsh Arabs and the ancient [[Sumer]]ians based on shared agricultural practices and methods of house-building. There is, however, no written record of the marsh tribes until the ninth century, and the Sumerians lost their distinct ethnic identity by around 1800 BCE, some 2700 years before.&lt;ref name=ghareeb&gt;Edmund Ghareeb, ''Historical Dictionary of Iraq'', 2004, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, have noted that much of the culture of the Maʻdān is in fact shared with the desert [[bedouin]] who came to the area after the fall of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and that it is therefore likely that they are descended from this source, at least in part.&lt;ref name=thesiger101&gt;Thesiger, pp.100-01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
A 2011 Study showed that Marsh Arabs have a high concentration of Y-chomosomal [[Haplogroup J-M267]] and mtDNA [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|haplogroup J]] having the highest concentration, with haplogroups [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]], [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]] and [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] following.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Zahery et al. - ''In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: a survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq'' - - BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:288 [http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-11-288.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; According to this study, Marsh Arabs have the following haplogroups.
* Y-DNA haplogroups:

==1991–2003==
{{Main|Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes}}
The marshes had for some time been considered a refuge for elements persecuted by the government of [[Saddam Hussein]], as in past centuries they had been a refuge for escaped [[slavery|slaves]] and [[serfdom|serfs]], such as during the [[Zanj Rebellion]]. By the mid-1980s, a low-level [[insurgency]] against [[Ba'athist]] drainage and resettlement projects had developed in the area, led by Sheik Abdul Kerim Mahud al-Muhammadawi of the Al bu Muhammad under the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' Abu Hatim.&lt;ref name=colep12&gt;[[Juan Cole]], ''[http://www.indiana.edu/~nelc/lectures/Wadie%20Jwaideh%20-%2004%20-%20Juan%20Cole%20(2005).pdf Marsh Arab Rebellion]'', [[University of Indiana]], 2005, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, the expansion of [[irrigation]] projects had begun to disrupt the flow of water to the marshes. However, after the [[First Gulf War]] (1991), the Iraqi government aggressively revived a program to divert the flow of the [[Tigris River]] and the [[Euphrates River]] away from the marshes in retribution for a [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|failed Shia uprising]]. This was done primarily to eliminate the food source(s) of the Marsh Arabs and to prevent any remaining militiamen from taking refuge in the marshes, the [[Badr Organization|Badr Brigades]] and other militias having used them as cover. The plan, which was accompanied by a series of [[propaganda]] articles by the Iraqi regime directed against the Ma'dan,&lt;ref name=fisk&gt;[[Robert Fisk]], ''The Great War for Civilisation'', Harper, London 2005, p.844&lt;/ref&gt; systematically converted the [[wetlands]] into a [[desert]], forcing the residents out of their settlements in the region. Villages in the marshes were attacked and burnt down and there were reports of the water being deliberately poisoned.&lt;ref name=unep2&gt;,[http://www.grid.unep.ch/activities/sustainable/tigris/mesopotamia.pdf The Mesopotamian Marshlands: Demise of an Ecosystem] [[UNEP]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the Maʻdān were displaced either to areas adjacent to the drained marshes, abandoning their traditional lifestyle in favour of conventional agriculture, to towns and camps in other areas of Iraq or to [[Iran]]ian refugee camps. Only 1,600 of them were estimated to still be living on traditional ''dibins'' by 2003.&lt;ref name=Colep13&gt;Cole, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The western [[Hammar Marshes]] and the Qurnah or [[Central Marshes (Iraq)|Central Marshes]] had become completely desiccated, while the eastern [[Hawizeh Marshes (Iraq/Iran)|Hawizeh Marshes]] had dramatically shrunk. The Marsh Arabs, who numbered about half a million in the 1950s, have dwindled to as few as 20,000 in Iraq, according to the United Nations. An estimated 80,000 to 120,000 have fled to refugee camps in Iran.&lt;ref name="Marsh"&gt;[http://www.simplysharing.com/sumerians.htm Iraq's Marsh Arabs, Modern Sumerians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527021202/http://www.simplysharing.com/sumerians.htm |date=2011-05-27 }} - The Oregonian, May 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Observer Middle East correspondent Shyam Bhatia who spent two weeks with the Marsh Arabs in 1993 wrote the first eye witness account of  Iraqi army tactics at the time of draining the marshes, bombing Marsh villages and then sowing mines in the water before retreating. Bhatia's extensive reportage won him the title of International Reporter of the Year, although exclusive film footage of the time he spent in the area has never been projected.&lt;ref&gt;BBC news, 3 March 2003 and BBC World Service 11 Nov, 2014, Atlantis Online, House of Commons Hansard debates 2 April, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 2003==
With the breaching of dikes by local communities subsequent to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the ending of a four-year drought that same year, the process has been reversed and the marshes have experienced a substantial rate of recovery. The permanent wetlands now cover more than 50% of 1970s levels, with a remarkable regrowth of the [[Hammar Marshes|Hammar]] and [[Hawizeh Marshes]] and some recovery of the [[Central Marshes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grid.unep.ch/product/poster/images/iraqi_marshlandsb Iraqi Marshlands: Steady Progress to Recovery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608084129/http://www.grid.unep.ch/product/poster/images/iraqi_marshlandsb |date=June 8, 2011 }} ([[United Nations Environment Programme]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to restore the marshes have led to signs of their gradual revivification as water is restored to the former [[desert]], but the whole [[ecosystem]] may take far longer to restore than it took to destroy. Only a few thousand of the nearly half million Marsh Arabs remain in the area in [[Maysan Governorate]], [[Dhi Qar Governorate]] and [[Basra Governorate]]. Most of the rest that can be accounted for are refugees living in other Shi'i areas in [[Iraq]], or have emigrated to [[Iran]], and many do not wish to return to their former home and lifestyle, which despite its independence was characterised by extreme poverty and hardship. A report by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] noted that while some Maʻdān had chosen to return to their traditional activities in the marshes, especially the Hammar Marshes, within a short time of reflooding, they were without clean drinking water, sanitation, health care or education facilities.&lt;ref name=USAID2&gt;[[United States Agency for International Development]] [http://www.iraqmarshes.org/Documents/Final%20Report/IRAQ%20MARSHLANDS-chapter1.pdf Iraq Marshlands Restoration Program Final Report, Chapter 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111100500/http://www.iraqmarshes.org/Documents/Final%20Report/IRAQ%20MARSHLANDS-chapter1.pdf |date=2014-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is still uncertain if the marshes will completely recover, given increased levels of water extraction from the Tigris and Euphrates.

Many of the resettled Marsh Arabs have gained representation through the [[Hezbollah Movement in Iraq]]; others have become followers of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]'s movement, through which they gained political control of [[Maysan Governorate]].&lt;ref name=colep14&gt;Cole, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Political instability and local feuds, aggravated by the poverty of the dispossessed Marsh Arab population, remain a serious problem.&lt;ref name=cole&gt;See Cole, pp.24-33&lt;/ref&gt; Rory Stewart observed that throughout history, the Maʻdān were the pawn of many rulers and became expert dissimulators. The tribal chiefs are outwardly submissive and work with the coalition and Iraqi officials. Behind the scenes, the tribes engage in smuggling and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Rory|title=The Prince of the Marshes: And Other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq|year=2006|publisher=Harcourt Books,|location=Orlando, FL:|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[Pietro Della Valle]] (1586–1652) is cited in [[Gavin Young]]'s ''Return to the Marshes'' as the earliest modern traveler to write about Mesopotamia and probably the first to introduce the word ''Madi'', which he spelled "Maedi," to the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Young |first=Gavin |title=Return to the Marshes |origyear=1977 |year=1978 |publisher=Futura Publications |location=Great Britain |isbn=0-7088-1354-2 |pages=48–49 |quote=The earliest of these 'modern' travel notebooks dates back to the seventeenth century, and that is my excuse for skipping at this point back to a man who wrote about Mesopotamia some two hundred years before Niebuhr. [...] 'Being suspicious of some Arabian Maedi's, that is, Vagrants or Vagabonds (so call'd because they abide with Droves of Buffles)...for more security we removed a mile further.' So, in 1625, wrote the bold but cautious Italian nobeleman, Pietro della Valle and in doing so broadcast to the European world, probably for the first time, the word Maedi (or as one would write it today, Madi), the adjective deriving from Madan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young also mentions [[George Keppel, 6th Earl of Albemarle]] (1799–1891) as having spent time with the Madan in 1824 and reported in detail on the marsh inhabitants. Of the men Keppel wrote, "The Arab boatmen were as hardy and muscular-looking fellows as ever I saw. One loose brown shirt, of the coarseness of sack-cloth, was the only covering of the latter. This, when labour required it, was thrown aside, and discovered forms most admirably adapted to their laborious avocations; indeed, any of the boatmen would have made an excellent model for an Hercules; and one in particular, with uncombed hair and shaggy beard, struck us all with the resemblance he bore to statues of that deity." Of the women Keppel observed, "They came to our boat with the frankness of innocence and there was a freedom in their manners, bordering perhaps on the masculine; nevertheless their fine features and well-turned limbs produced a ''tout ensemble'' of beauty, not to be surpassed perhaps in the brilliant assemblies of civilized life."&lt;ref&gt;Young, pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account of the Maʻdān in English was jointly published in 1927 by a British colonial administrator, Stuart Edwin Hedgecock, and his wife.&lt;ref name=rikkan&gt;Fulanain (S. E. and M. G. Hedgecock) ''Haji Rikkan: Marsh Arab'', Chatto &amp; Windus, London, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, p. 69. "At the time of which I am writing Philby was the arabophile, though truculent, Political Officer of Amara. One who soon succeeded him there was S. E. Hedgecock who, with his young wife, wrote a wonderfully vivid book about the people he administered called ''Haji Rikkan: Marsh Arab'', using (because officials are not purposed to write books when they are on the job) the pseudonym 'Fulanain'."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Bell]] also visited the area.&lt;ref name=bell&gt;See Letters at [http://www.gerty.ncl.ac.uk/ The Gertrude Bell Project], [[Newcastle University]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. E. Lawrence]] passed through in 1916, stopping at [[Basra]] and [[Ezra's Tomb]] (Al-Azair), and recorded that the Marsh Arabs were "wonderfully hard [...] but merry, and full of talk. They are in the water all their lives, and seem hardly to notice it."&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;Thomas Edward Lawrence, [http://telawrence.net/telawrencenet/letters/1916/160518_family.htm Letter of 18 May 1916, telawrence.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The way of life of the Marsh Arabs was later described by the explorer [[Wilfred Thesiger]] in his classic ''The Marsh Arabs'' (1964). Thesiger lived with the Marsh Arabs for months at a time over a seven-year period (1951–1958), building excellent relationships with virtually all he met, and recording the details of day-to-day life in various regions of the marshes. Many of the areas that he visited have since been drained. [[Gavin Maxwell]], the Scottish naturalist, travelled with Thesiger through the marshes in 1956 and published an account of their travels in his 1957 book ''A Reed Shaken by the Wind'' (later republished under the title ''People of the Reeds''). The journalist and travel writer [[Gavin Young]] followed in Thesiger's footsteps, writing ''Return to the Marshes: Life with the Marsh Arabs of Iraq'' (1977; reissued 2009).

The first extensive scholarly ethnographic account of Marsh Arab life was ''Marsh Dwellers of the Euphrates Delta'' (1962), by Iraqi anthropologist [[Shakir Mustafa Salim|S. M. Salim]]. An [[ethnoarchaeology|ethnoarchaeological]] study of the material culture of the Marsh Arabs has been published by Edward L. Ochsenschlager: ''Iraq's Marsh Arabs in the Garden of Eden'' ([[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], 2004).

[[Rory Stewart]] described the Marsh Arabs and his experiences as deputy governor in the Maysan province (2003–2004) in his 2006 book, ''[[The Prince of the Marshes]]'' (also published under the title ''Occupational Hazards'').

In 2011, Sam Kubba published ''The Iraqi Marshlands and the Marsh Arabs: The Ma'dan, Their Culture and the Environment''. The Iraqi Marshlands and the Marsh Arabs details the rich cultural legacy and lifestyle that survives today only as a fragmented cultural inheritance.

In German, there are Sigrid Westphal-Hellbusch und Heinz Westphal, ''Die Ma'dan: Kultur und Geschichte der Marschenbewohner im Süd-Iraq'' (Berlin: Duncker und Humblot, 1962). Sigrid Westphal Hellbusch and her husband Heinz Westphal wrote a comprehensive study on the Madan based on research and observation obtained while living with Madan tribes. These observations outline how the Madan diverge from other Shia communities.

'''Nina Dudnik''' is a social entrepreneur, science diplomacy advocate, and the founder and CEO of Seeding Labs, a US-based nonprofit organization investing in building scientific capacity in the developing world. Dudnik founded the organization in 2003 as a graduate student studying at [[Harvard University]], where she received her PhD in molecular biology. 

== Education and early career ==
Dudnik received her Bachelors of Science in [[biochemistry]] from [[Brown University]]. Between college and graduate school, she worked in agricultural development as a consultant for [[CGIAR]] (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research) in Italy, and then became a [[Fulbright scholar]] in [[Cote d’Ivoire]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After her year in Africa, she returned to the United States to attend [[Harvard University]], where she received her PhD in [[molecular biology]]. She did her doctoral work in the laboratory of Dr. Kami Ahmad, where she ultimately published her dissertation, "Histone dimers on the move: Nucleosome assembly systems for H2A and H2AV in ''Drosophila''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/ef4de56b71402ffc2f0e3cf4f5b3587e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y|title=Histone dimers on the move: Nucleosome assembly systems for H2A and H2AV in Drosophila|last=Dudnik|first=Nina|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|year=2008|isbn=|location=|publication-place=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Global development work ==
Dudnik had personally felt the effects of lack of access to scientific resources in developing countries when doing her Fulbright work in Côte d'Ivoire, where she was working to breed better varieties of rice. There, she saw a gap between a wealth of scientific talent and a dearth of access to research equipment to put that talent to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/26/141666558/used-lab-equipment-finds-a-second-home-overseas|title=Used Lab Equipment Finds A Second Home Overseas|last=Daniel|first=Ari|date=October 26, 2011|work=NPR|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2015/06/15/transferable-skills-beyond-the-bench/|title=Transferable skills: Beyond the bench : Naturejobs Blog|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she returned to the United States to pursue her doctoral degree, she worked to bridge that gap. She led a group of fellow students in collecting surplus biological equipment and supplies at Harvard University to send to labs in developing countries to support the research they were doing at their local institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gould|first=Julie|date=2015-11-11|title=Non-profit organizations: Scientists on a mission|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7577/full/nj7577-265a.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=527|issue=7577|pages=265–266|doi=10.1038/nj7577-265a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort became the basis of Seeding Labs, which formally launched in 2007 when Dudnik was awarded the [[Echoing Green]] fellowship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/nina-dudnik|title=Nina Dudnik {{!}} Echoing Green|website=www.echoinggreen.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Seeding Labs was established as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/10-8267613|title=Seeding Labs A Nonprofit Corporation - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dudnik and her team have since expanded Seeding Labs beyond equipment transfer, developing exchange programs to train scientists from developing countries in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2012/08/03/nonprofit-hosts-visiting-scientists/ffhfGtWL9T00sx2HYWNuHI/story.html|title=Nonprofit hosts visiting scientists - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has promoted the organization's vision as a TEDGlobal Fellow, a PopTech Social Innovation Fellow, and at the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/people/nina-dudnik|title=Nina Dudnik|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have received funding and support from a combination of government organizations like the [[United States Agency for International Development]], academic institutions like [[Harvard University]], and private companies like [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/frontlines/may-june-2017/equipping-next-generation-scientists-and-medical-workers-ghana|title=Equipping the Next Generation of Scientists and Medical Workers in Ghana {{!}} FrontLines May/June 2017 {{!}} U.S. Agency for International Development|website=www.usaid.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://seedinglabs.org/2017/03/positively-instrumental-event/|title=“Positively Instrumental” Event Honors Donors, Instrumental Access 2017 Awardees • Seeding Labs|date=2017-03-23|work=Seeding Labs|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and rebellion==

It is said that Akahachi was born on [[Hateruma]] Island, and that he was large and physically strong even as a child. He moved to [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigaki Island]] as a young adult, and became the chief of Ōhama Village (today part of Ishigaki City) soon afterward.&lt;ref name=jinmei&gt;"Oyake Akahachi." ''Okinawa rekishi jinmei jiten'' (沖縄歴史人名事典, "Encyclopedia of People of Okinawan History"). Naha: Okinawa Bunka-sha, 1996. p18.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence soon extended over all of Ishigaki Island, and beyond, to other islands in the [[Yaeyama Islands]] group. At some point late in the 15th century, the nearby [[Miyako Islands]] were divided between two influential families, the Nakasone and Kaneshigawa, who were fighting one another for dominance of the area. Seeking to take advantage of the chaos and disunity, Akahachi proposed an invasion of the Miyako Islands. However, [[Nakasone Toyomiya]] led a counterattack against Akahachi, overwhelming his forces and moving on to attack [[Yonaguni Island]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, George. ''Okinawa: the History of an Island People''. (revised ed.) Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing, 2000. p121.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], based at [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] on [[Okinawa Island]], did not yet have direct control over the Yaeyama or Miyako Islands, but merely expected [[tribute]] to be paid. Akahachi led the people of Ishigaki and the surrounding islands in revolt against the kingdom, refusing to pay taxes or tribute. After Nakasone conquered Yaeyama, a force of roughly 3,000 Ryukyuan troops was sent by King [[Shō Shin]] in 1500, and the rebellion was suppressed with the annexation of the [[Sakishima Islands]].&lt;ref name=jinmei/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[Image:Hateruma akahachi.jpg|thumb|Akahachi Memorial on Hateruma]]
While official records and histories produced by the Ryukyu Kingdom label Oyake Akahachi as a rebel and a traitor, locally on Ishigaki and the surrounding islands he is known as a hero who sought to secure their freedom and independence.&lt;ref name=jinmei/&gt; A [[stele]] in his honor can be found today in the Ōhama area of Ishigaki City.

[[File:Carnavalet_-_Modèle_réduit_de_la_Bastille_01.jpg|thumb|right|One of Palloy's models made from a stone from the Bastille]]
'''Pierre-François Palloy''' (23 January 1755 – 1835), self-styled as '''''Palloy Patriote''''' ('''Palloy the Patriot''') was an entrepreneurial building contractor remembered for the demolition of the [[Bastille]].

==Life==
Palloy was born in 1755 in Paris. Both his parents came from bourgeois families active in the wine retailing industry. Palloy was educated at the ''College d'Harcourt'', where many of the students were from upper-class liberal backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Schama]], page 409 "[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]", {{ISBN|0-670-81012-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left school at the age of fifteen to join the [[French Royal Army (1652–1830)|French Royal Army]] as a cadet and then as an officer.  On leaving this career at the age of twenty, he married the daughter of a building contractor and joined the trade himself, eventually taking over his new family's business.  By 1789 he had made the company one of the largest building firms in Paris, employing 400 workers.&lt;ref name="HJL"&gt;Lüsebrink, Hans-Jürgen.  Reichardt, Rolf.  ''The Bastille: a history of a symbol of despotism and freedom''.  Duke University Press Books, 27 June 1997. p. 114–134&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Storming of the Bastille|the Bastille fell]] on 14 July 1789 there was some debate as to what should replace it, or indeed if it should remain as a monument to the past.  However, Palloy knew exactly what he wanted to do and by that evening had begun the process of dismantling the structure; he secured the contract to demolish the building two days later.&lt;ref name="HJL" /&gt; Most of the building was removed over the subsequent months by approximately 1,000 workers.&lt;ref name="DF"&gt;[http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Paris/Monuments-Paris/Bastille5.shtml Place de la Bastille, Part 5], Discover France.  Accessed 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[dimension stone]]s were reused for the construction of the [[Pont de la Concorde (Paris)|Pont de la Concorde]].&lt;ref name="CAS"&gt;[http://cultureandstuff.com/2011/05/24/lost-paris-the-elephant-on-the-place-de-la-bastille/ Lost Paris: The Elephant on the Place de la Bastille].  24 May 2011.  Accessed 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Palloy did not receive the official payment for several years, he knew how to profit from the possession of such an iconic structure in the meantime. Staff conducted tours, for a fee, to show the public around the basements and dungeons with skeletons as props.  Palloy labelled himself a [[patriotism|patriot]] and emphasised the symbolism of the Bastille, writing speeches, painting pictures, and even arranging celebratory festivals and theatrical reconstructions of the day the Bastille fell.&lt;ref name="HJL" /&gt;  He sold other parts as souvenirs&lt;ref name="CAS" /&gt; including replica Bastilles made from the 
stones of the building itself.  He even sent examples of these miniatures to each of the [[Departments of France|83 departments]] asking only to be reimbursed for transport and postage.&lt;ref name="HJL" /&gt;

===Later life===
In early 1794 Palloy was held in prison on charges of [[embezzlement]] and of being a [[Hébertists|Hébertist]] but was released after two months.&lt;ref name="HJL" /&gt;  In 1814 he was awarded the [[Décoration du Lys]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4167">'''Raffique Shah''' is a [[Trinidad and Tobago]] [[trade union]] leader and political commentator.  He is also a former [[Member of Parliament]] and mutineer, having led a mutiny of [[Trinidad and Tobago Regiment]] in 1970. He was born the son of a sugar cane worker and housewife in March 1946. His early education was at Presentation College, Chaguanas, where he gained a Grade I Cambridge School Certificate. He later won a cadetship to the prestigious [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] between 1964 and 1966.

As a [[Lieutenant]] in the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment, he led an army mutiny in 1970.  In the midst of [[Black Power]] riots, the [[People's National Movement]] government led by [[Eric Williams]] proclaimed a [[State of Emergency]] April, 1970 and arrested several Black Power leaders and [[Trade Union]]ists.  In a move to prevent Williams from using the military against the masses, a portion of the Regiment stationed at Teteron (on the [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] Peninsula), led by [[Lieutenant]]s Shah and [[Rex Lassalle]] mutinied.  In response, the [[Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force#Coast Guard|Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard]] fired on the mutineers who returned to Teteron Barracks, abandoning their foray into Port of Spain.  After ten days the mutineers surrendered.  The leaders were [[court-martial]]ed and Shah and Lasalle were jailed. They both went on to win their appeals at the local Court of Appeal, and judges at the Privy Council in London, England, ruled against the State's appeal in July, 1972. Shah, Lassalle and all the other mutineers were freed within 24 hours of that ruling.

After being released from prison Shah joined the Trade Union movement leading the ICFTU, a body of cane farmers who sought to displace the government recognised organisation,TICFA. He, [[George Weekes]] and [[Basdeo Panday]] went on to found the [[United Labour Front]] in 1975 as a labor confederation and transformed it into a political party in 1976. During general election later that year, the ULF secured 10 of the 36 seats in [[House of Representatives of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]] and became the official [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]].  [[Basdeo Panday]] was appointed [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]], but following a bitter row in the party, Shah was able to displace him, and served as Leader of the Opposition between August 9, 1977 and March 31, 1978 when Panday regained control of the party.

Shah went on to lead the cane farmers and won an election to head the [[Trinidad Islandwide Cane Farmers' Association]] (TICFA), in 1998. He has been chairman of that organisation to date. Shah also served as editor of the ''Trinidad and Tobago Mirror'' newspaper for 17 years and today serves as an [[op-ed]] columnist in the ''Trinidad Express'' newspaper. He is also known as the man who founded the prestigious annual Clico Trinidad &amp; Tobago International Marathon, an event that spawned road running throughout the Caribbean. He remained chairman of the organising committee until he stepped down in 2005. He served, too, as secretary of the local National Amateur Athletics Association and still holds a strong interest in sports in general and athletics in particular.

==Life==
Sineperver Sultan performed Valide Sultan's obligations as [[de facto]] co-ruler of the [[Ottoman Sultan]] for fourteen months from 29 May 1807 until 28 July 1808. She was responsible for his education, but Mustafa preferred to live a life of pleasure instead of focusing on his studies. Her regency culminated by the deposition of Mustafa IV as a result of an [[Ottoman coups of 1807–08|insurrection]] led by [[Alemdar Mustafa Pasha]] on 28 July 1808. She apparently fell on hard times, for she wrote Mahmud II a letter in which she asked him for a house to live in.&lt;ref name="fanny"/&gt;

She lived more than twenty years after the execution of [[Mustafa IV]] by order of the next Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]]. She died on 11 December 1828 in [[Constantinople]]. Her burial place is located at ''The Fountain (Şadırvan) Courtyard'' of [[Eyüp Sultan Mosque]] in [[Eyüp]], [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

==Issue==
Together with Abdul Hamid, Sineperver had four children:

Vakarchuk founded the band [[Okean Elzy]] ("Ocean of Elza"), in 1994 as an undergraduate at [[Lviv University]].&lt;ref name="vakarchuk201891"/&gt; At this university he earned a Ph.D. in the field of [[supersymmetry]].&lt;ref name="vakarchuk201891"/&gt; After graduation Vakarchuk moved to [[Kiev]].&lt;ref name="vakarchuk201891"/&gt;

In 2005 Vakarchuk answered all questions correctly and won the grand prize (1 million [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]]s) for the first time on the Ukrainian version of [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]], called [[Khto khoche staty milyonerom? – Pershyi milyon]]. He donated his winnings to orphanages in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vakarchuk.com/novyny/2005/02/02/vakarchuk-trishky-pobuv-milyonerom/ ''Вакарчук трішки побув мільйонером'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2007|30 September 2007 parliamentary election]] he appeared as an independent candidate on the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]]'s list (as nr 15). In the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament) he was a member of the parliamentary committee for [[freedom of speech]] questions. In early September 2008, he renounced his seat in the Verkhovna Rada due to the [[2008 Ukrainian political crisis|political situation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Vakarchuk was a member of the parliamentary committee for [[freedom of speech in Ukraine|freedom of speech]] questions. He was also a member of groups of parliamentary contacts with Russian Federation and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itd.rada.gov.ua/mps/info/expage/11120/7|title=Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України|website=itd.rada.gov.ua|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vakarchuk did not submit any legislative acts during his deputy's term. He submitted two amendments, one of which was accepted by the Verkhovna Rada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/pt2/reports.dep2?PERSON=11120&amp;SKL=7|title=Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України|website=w1.c1.rada.gov.ua|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 2008, the Verkhovna Rada accepted Vakarchuk's renunciation from his seat in the parliament due to his personal motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zakon.rada.gov.ua/go/664-17|title=Про дострокове припинення повноважень народного депутата У... {{!}}  від 16.12.2008 № 664-VI|website=zakon.rada.gov.ua|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vakarchuk he renounced his parliamentary seat becuase “I was really frustrated by the level of mutual fights, at the absurd [[Hobbesian]] world of all against all, rather than changing the country for the better.”&lt;ref name="vakarchuk201891"/&gt;

In 2008, Svyatoslav Vakarchuk released a solo project "[[Vnochi (music album)|Vnochi]]" (In the Night). This album was released under the name of Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, but it includes appearances by all members of "[[Okean Elzy]]" and other various guest musicians. Another solo project followed in 2011, "[[Brussel (music album)|Brussel]]" (Brussels).

In support of their latest album "Zemlya" in spring 2013, the band embarked on a stadium tour throughout cities in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, USA, Canada, and a number of countries in Western Europe.

In December 2013 Okean Elzy  performed during [[Euromaidan]]-protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/news/world/ukraine-suspends-mayor-security-official-over-protest-crackdown_896844.html Ukraine suspends mayor, security official over protest crackdown], [[Zee News]] (14 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2014, Okean Elzy performed a number of large scale concerts in the biggest stadiums in Ukraine dedicated to the band's 20th anniversary. Their performance in Kiev's [[Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex|Olympiyskiy Stadium]] broken the record for the largest number of people attending a concert by a Ukrainian band — over 75 thousand.

In 2015 Vakarchuk took part in the [[Yale World Fellows]] international fellowship program at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="vakarchuk-to-study-at-yale-as-third"/&gt;

Vakarchuk stated multiple times in 2017 that he had no political ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.expres.ua/#!/n/259102 President Vakarchuk: The musician spoke about political ambitions], [[Ekspres]] (26 August 2017) {{uk icon}}&lt;br&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2017/12/10/7165015/ Vakarchuk broke away from political ambitions, but called 10 points for Ukraine's development], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (10 December 2017) {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in 2018 he joined [[Stanford University]] as a visiting scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okeanelzy.com/en/news/437/|title=Sviatoslav Vakarchuk joins Stanford as a visiting scholar this fall|website=www.okeanelzy.com|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, focusing on politics and leadership. Later that year he appeared at several political-themed conferences, speaking alongside established Ukrainian politicians &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yes-ukraine.org/en/news/vladu-v-ukrayini-mayut-vzyati-lyudi-yakim-doviryaye-suspilstvo-svyatoslav-vakarchuk|title=Vakarchuk presents at Yalta YES conference|website=yes-ukraine.org|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This led public to view him as a potential candidate for the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2019|2019 Ukrainian presidential election]], where he is one of the frontrunners according to the [[Opinion polling for the Ukrainian presidential election, 2019|opinion polls]].

Vakarchuk also takes an active part in social and cultural projects, and is the founder of the Charity Fund "Lyudi Maybutnyogo" (People of the Future).  The main projects of the Fund were "Knyga Tvoryt' Lyudynu" (A Book Creates A Man), "Osvita Krainoyu" (The Country's Education), "3-D Proekt. Dumay, Diy, Dopomogai." (3-D Project. Think, Act. Help.). Together with the members of the band he actively supported the preventive campaign IOM and MTV Europe's "People Are Not For Sale." In 2003 Svyatoslav had become an Honorary Ambassador of Culture in Ukraine. In 2005 he became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme.

The Ukrainian magazine ''[[Korrespondent]]'' ranks him as one of the 100 most influential people of Ukraine (in 2008 ranked 55).&lt;ref&gt;Korrespondent 2008-08-22, nr 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Tramp''' (''Charlot'' in several languages), also known as '''The Little Tramp''', was British actor [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s most memorable on-screen character and an icon in [[world cinema]] during the era of [[silent film]].  ''[[The Tramp (film)|The Tramp]]'' is also the title of a silent film starring Chaplin, which Chaplin wrote and directed in 1915.

The Tramp, as portrayed by Chaplin, is a childlike, bumbling but generally good-hearted character who is most famously portrayed as a [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] who endeavors to behave with the manners and dignity of a gentleman despite his actual social status. However, while he is ready to take what paying work is available, he also uses his cunning to get what he needs to survive and escape the authority figures who will not tolerate his antics. Chaplin's films did not always portray the Tramp as a vagrant, however. The character ("The little fellow," as Chaplin called him) was rarely referred to by any names on-screen, although he was sometimes identified as "Charlie" and rarely, as in the original silent version of ''[[The Gold Rush]]'', "The little funny tramp".

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--3 paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
[[File:Mabel's Strange Predicament (1914).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.5|''[[Mabel's Strange Predicament]]'', the first film produced in which Chaplin plays the Tramp]]
[[File:Chaplin - Kid Auto Races in Venice.png|thumb|right|''[[Kid Auto Races at Venice]]'' was the first appearance of the Tramp released but actually the second film shot.]]
[[File:Charlie Chaplin circa 1916.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Chaplin in 1916]]
The character of the Tramp was originally created by accident while Chaplin was working at [[Mack Sennett]]'s [[Keystone Studios]], when dressing up for the short film ''[[Mabel's Strange Predicament]]'' starring [[Mabel Normand]] and Chaplin. In a 1933 interview, Chaplin explained how he came up with the look of the Tramp:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Comedian Sees the World |author=Charlie Chaplin |journal=[[Woman's Home Companion]] |date=November 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A hotel set was built for (fellow Keystone comic) [[Mabel Normand]]'s picture ''[[Mabel's Strange Predicament]]'' and I was hurriedly told to put on a funny make-up. This time I went to the wardrobe and got a pair of baggy pants, a tight coat, a small derby hat and a large pair of shoes. I wanted the clothes to be a mass of contradictions, knowing pictorially the figure would be vividly outlined on the screen. To add a comic touch, I wore a small mustache which would not hide my expression. My appearance got an enthusiastic response from everyone, including Mr. Sennett. The clothes seemed to imbue me with the spirit of the character. He actually became a man with a soul—a point of view. I defined to Mr. Sennett the type of person he was. He wears an air of romantic hunger, forever seeking romance, but his feet won't let him.}}
That was actually the first film featuring the Tramp but a different film, shot later but with the same character, happened to be released two days earlier.  The Tramp debuted to the public in the [[Keystone Studios|Keystone]] [[comedy film|comedy]] ''[[Kid Auto Races at Venice]]'' (released on February 7, [[1914 in film|1914]]; ''Mabel's Strange Predicament'', shot earlier, was released on February 9, 1914). Chaplin, with his Little Tramp character, quickly became the most popular star in Keystone director [[Mack Sennett]]'s company of players. Chaplin continued to play the Tramp through dozens of short films and, later, feature-length productions. (In only a handful of other productions did he play characters other than the Tramp).

The Tramp was closely identified with the silent era, and was considered an international character. When the [[sound film|sound]] era began in the late 1920s, Chaplin refused to make a [[talkie]] featuring the character, partly due to how the character was supposed to be American, and Chaplin himself had a strong and obvious British accent. The 1931 production ''[[City Lights]]'' featured no dialogue. Chaplin officially retired the character in the film ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' (released February 5, [[1936 in film|1936]]), which appropriately ended with the Tramp walking down an endless highway toward the horizon. The film was only a partial talkie and is often called the last silent film. The Tramp remains silent until near the end of the film when, for the first time, his voice is finally heard, albeit only as part of a French/Italian-derived gibberish song. This allowed the Tramp to finally be given a voice but not tarnish his association with the silent era.

In ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', Chaplin's first film after ''Modern Times'', Chaplin plays the dual role of a [[Hitler]]-esque dictator, and a Jewish barber. Although Chaplin emphatically stated that the barber was not the Tramp, he retains the Tramp's moustache, hat, and general appearance. Despite a few silent scenes, including one where the barber is wearing the Tramp's coat and bowler hat and carrying his cane, the barber speaks throughout the film (using Chaplin's own British accent), including the passionate plea for peace that has been widely interpreted as Chaplin speaking as himself.

In 1959, having been editing ''The Chaplin Revue'', Chaplin commented to a reporter (regarding the Tramp character) "I was wrong to kill him. There was room for the Little Man in the atomic age."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Chaplin: His Life And Art |page=137 |isbn=0141979186 |author=David Robinson |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[vaudeville]] performer named [[Lew Bloom]] created a similar tramp character which inspired Chaplin. According to Bloom, he was "the first stage tramp in the business".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=DePastino |first=Todd |title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2003 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:The Tramp (film).jpg|thumb|left|The Tramp on the road.]]
The physical attributes of the Tramp include a pair of baggy pants, a tight coat, a small [[bowler hat]], a large pair of shoes, a springy and flexible cane and the [[Toothbrush moustache|famous small mustache]]. The Tramp walks strangely and uncomfortably because of the ill-fitting clothing; either he is wearing secondhand clothes, or they are originally his but he cannot afford new ones. The Tramp may have seen better days, but he maintains the attitude and demeanor of a high-class individual; as long as he acts like one he can believe that he is one, and is able to keep his hope that some day he actually will be again.

Two films made in 1915, ''[[The Tramp (film)|The Tramp]]'' and ''[[The Bank (1915 film)|The Bank]]'', created the characteristics of Chaplin's screen persona. While in the end the Tramp manages to shake off his disappointment and resume his carefree ways, the pathos lies in the Tramp's having a hope for a more permanent transformation through love, and his failure to achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Christian |last=Hansmeyer |year=2007 |title=Charlie Chaplin's Techniques for the Creation of Comic Effect in His Films |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tramp was usually the victim of circumstance and coincidence, but sometimes the results worked in his favor. In ''Modern Times'', he picks up a [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] that falls off a truck and starts to wave it at the truck in an attempt to return it, and by doing so, unknowingly and inadvertently becomes the leader of a group of protesting workers, and ends up in jail because of it. While in jail he accidentally eats “nose powder” (i.e., [[cocaine]]), which causes him to not return to his jail cell; but when he eventually does, he fights off some jailbreakers attempting to escape, thus saving the life of the warden. Because of this, the warden offers to let him go, but the Tramp would rather stay in jail because it is better than the outside world.

==Significance==
[[File:Chaplin A Dogs Life.jpg|thumb|''[[A Dog's Life]]'' (1918)]]
Chaplin's social commentary, while critical of the faults and excesses created by [[industrialization]], also shows support for and belief in the “American Dream." In ''Modern Times'', Chaplin creates a “portrayal consistent with popular [[left-wing politics|leftist]] stereotypes of wealthy union leaders and oppressed workers in the 1930s.”{{sfn|Maland|1991|p=151}} While the Tramp and his fellow workers sweat on the assembly line, the president of the Electro Steel Company works on a puzzle and reads the funnies in the newspaper. The obsession of working with efficiency and assembly-line productivity ultimately drives the Tramp mad. This could be seen as “an attack on the capitalist rationalization of production.”{{sfn|Maland|1991|p=152}} However, “the film also guardedly affirms American middle-class, particularly its optimism.”{{sfn|Maland|1991|p=153}} For example, one sequence depicts the Tramp's dream in which he and the [[gamine]] live a traditional middle-class lifestyle.

The Tramp and the gamine find a rundown shack to live in. The gamine cooks a cheap breakfast, and then the Tramp is off to work, while the gamine stays to maintain the home—an allusion to a middle-class setting. By the ending of ''Modern Times'', “the film seems tailored to please the middle-class optimist.” Due to all of their failings the final scene had the gamine stating, “What's the use of trying?”, and the Tramp replying “Buck up—never say die.” In his silent films, Chaplin uniquely deployed critical social commentary. “What makes ''Modern Times'' decidedly different from Chaplin's previous three films are the political references and social realism that keep intruding into Charlie's world.”{{sfn|Maland|1991|p=150}} “No comedian before or after him has spent more energy depicting people in their working lives.”{{sfn|Maland|1991|p=110}} “Though there had been films depicting the lives of immigrants and urban workers, no filmmaker before Chaplin had created their experience so humanly and lovingly.”{{sfn|Maland|1991|p=113}}

Chaplin used not one but two similar-looking characters to the Tramp in ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (released October 15, 1940); however, this was an all-talking film (Chaplin's first). The film was inspired by the noted similarity between Chaplin's Tramp (most notably his small mustache) and that of [[Nazi Germany|German]] dictator [[Adolf Hitler]]. Chaplin used this similarity to create a dark version of the Tramp character in parody of the dictator. (In his book ''[[My Autobiography (Chaplin)|My Autobiography]]'', Chaplin stated that he was unaware of [[the Holocaust]] when he made the film; if he had been, he writes, he wouldn't have been able to make a comedy satirizing Hitler). In his autobiography, Chaplin identifies the barber as the Tramp.  A noticeable difference is that the barber has a streak of grey in his hair, whereas the Tramp had always been depicted as having dark hair. Also, the barber lacks the ill-fitting clothes of the Tramp, and is clearly portrayed as having a profession. His character does share much of The Tramp's character, notably his idealism and anger on seeing unfairness.

==The short film==
''[[The Tramp (film)|The Tramp]]'' is also a short film starring Chaplin as the titular main character. In the film, a hobo exchanges the Tramp's sandwich for a brick, so the Tramp must eat grass. The same hobo later bothers a farmer's daughter, and the Tramp comes to her aid with the help of the brick. When two more hobos show up, the Tramp throws all three into a lake. The grateful girl takes the Tramp home, where he fails as a farmhand. He again helps drive off the hobos (who are now trying to break into the house). The girl's fiancé arrives. Though a hero, Charlie—knowing he must go—writes a farewell note and leaves again for the open road.

The film also stars [[Edna Purviance]], [[Lloyd Bacon]], and Leo White.

''The Tramp'' was released on April 11, 1915, through [[Essanay Studios]].

==Legacy==
*Numerous works cite the Tramp as an icon of the [[Great Depression]], of [[Charlie Chaplin]] himself, and of the downtrodden hero, from Chaplin's own movies with similar characters (such as ''The Great Dictator''), to the dapper, silent penguin rescued by [[Bugs Bunny]].
*In the 1980s, the character was portrayed in advertising for the [[IBM PC]] [[personal computer]].&lt;ref&gt;Caputi, Jane (1994).

Harrell has won awards and grants, including multiple Trumpeter of the Year awards from ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="th-la-times1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/04/entertainment/ca-40252|title=Tom Harrell Goes the Big-Band Rout|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=December 4, 1999|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728161334/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/04/entertainment/ca-40252|archivedate=July 28, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SESAC]] Jazz Award, BMI ([[Broadcast Music Incorporated]]) Composers Award, and Prix Oscar du Jazz.  He received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for his big band album, ''[[Time's Mirror]]''.

==Biography==
Tom Harrell was born in [[Urbana, Illinois]] but moved to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] at the age of five.  He started playing trumpet at eight, and within five years he was playing gigs with local bands. In 1969 he graduated from [[Stanford University]] with a music composition degree and joined [[Stan Kenton]]'s orchestra, touring and recording with them throughout 1969.&lt;ref name="th-aaj-profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicians.allaboutjazz.com/musician.php?id=7432|title=Musician Profile: Tom Harrell|publisher=All About Jazz|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213083139/http://musicians.allaboutjazz.com/musician.php?id=7432|archivedate=December 13, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th-notjazz-blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notoriousjazz.com/era/1941-1960/daily-dose-of-jazz-896|title=Daily Dose of Jazz… Tom Harrell|publisher=notorious jazz blog|accessdate=September 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902022222/http://notoriousjazz.com/era/1941-1960/daily-dose-of-jazz-896|archivedate=September 2, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Kenton, Harrell played with [[Woody Herman]]'s big band (1970–1971), [[Azteca (band)|Azteca]] (1972), the [[Horace Silver]] Quintet (1973–1977), with whom he made five albums, the [[Samuel Jones (musician)|Sam Jones]]-Tom Harrell Big Band, the [[Lee Konitz]] Nonet (1979–1981), [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], and the [[Mel Lewis]] Orchestra (1981). From 1983 to 1989 he was a pivotal member of the [[Phil Woods]] Quintet and made seven albums with the group. In addition, he recorded albums with [[Vince Guaraldi]] for whom he also did some arranging for the [[Peanuts]] television specials, [[Bill Evans]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ronnie Cuber]], [[Bob Brookmeyer]], [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Bob Berg]], [[Cecil Payne]], [[Bobby Shew]], [[Philip Catherine]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Ivan Paduart|fr}}, [[Joe Lovano]], [[Charlie Haden]]'s Liberation Orchestra, [[Charles McPherson (musician)|Charles McPherson]], [[David Sánchez (musician)|David Sánchez]], [[Sheila Jordan]], [[Jane Monheit]], the [[King's Singers]] and [[Kathleen Battle]] among others.&lt;ref name="th-aaj-profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="th-notjazz-blog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="th-am-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tom-harrell-mn0000605535/biography|title=Allmusic: Tom Harrell - Biography|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=September 1, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query.php|archivedate=July 29, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th-aaj-fireside"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=842&amp;page=1|title=Interview: A Fireside Chat With Tom Harrell|publisher=All About Jazz|date=November 14, 2003|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019103400/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=842&amp;page=1|archivedate=October 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrell is featured on Bill Evans' final studio recording, ''[[We Will Meet Again]]'', which won a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance, Group.&lt;ref name="th-grammy1981"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1981-229.html|title=Awards &amp; Shows – Grammy Awards 1981|publisher=awardsandshows.com|accessdate=August 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021164628/http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1981-229.html|archivedate=October 21, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Harrell recorded several albums as a leader during his tenure with the Phil Woods Quintet, it was after his departure that he started producing albums as a leader, in succession for [[Contemporary Records]] (now owned by [[Concord Records|Concord]]), [[Chesky Records|Chesky]], and RCA/BMG. During his years as a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] artist (1996–2003) first with [[RCA Records|RCA]], then [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] and finally [[Arista Records|Arista]], Harrell made six albums, many of which feature his arrangements for larger groups. Since the early 1990s, Harrell has toured and performed with his own groups of various sizes and instrumentation.&lt;ref name="th-aaj-profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="th-am-bio" /&gt;

Harrell is a prolific arranger and composer.  He has arranged for [[Vince Guaraldi]]'s work on ''Peanuts'', [[Carlos Santana]], the [[Metropole Orchestra]], the [[DR Big Band|Danish Radio Big Band]], the [[Vanguard Jazz Orchestra]], and Elisabeth Kontomanou with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Orchestre National de Lorraine|fr}}, among others. His compositions have been recorded by other jazz artists including [[Ron Carter]], [[Kenny Barron]], [[Art Farmer]], [[Chris Potter (jazz saxophonist)|Chris Potter]], [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], [[Steve Kuhn]], [[Kenny Werner]] and [[Hank Jones]]. Harrell's composition and big band arrangement entitled "Humility" was recorded on the [[Grammy]]-winning album by [[Arturo O'Farrill]]'s Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, ''[[Song for Chico]]''. As a composer and arranger, Harrell works in different genres, including classical music.&lt;ref name="th-aaj-profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="th-notjazz-blog" /&gt;&lt;ref name="th-jazztimes-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/21089-tom-harrell-senses-and-sensibilities|title=Tom Harrell: Senses and Sensibilities|publisher=JazzTimes|date=May 1998 |author=Bill Milkowski|accessdate=July 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720004415/http://jazztimes.com/articles/21089-tom-harrell-senses-and-sensibilities|archivedate=July 20, 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tom Harrell Quintet==
Since 1989 Harrell has led his own groups, usually quintets but occasionally expanded ensembles such as chamber orchestras with strings, and big bands.  He has appeared at most major jazz clubs and festival venues, and recorded under his own name for such record labels as [[RCA Records|RCA]], [[Contemporary Records|Contemporary]], Pinnacle, Blackhawk, [[Criss Cross Jazz|Criss Cross]], [[SteepleChase]], [[Chesky Records|Chesky]], and [[HighNote Records|HighNote]].&lt;ref name="th-notjazz-blog" /&gt;

In contrast to his signature recordings during the [[RCA Records|RCA]]/[[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] years (1996–2003), where much of his focus was on projects involving large ensembles, big bands and chamber orchestras, Harrell's more recent works demonstrate his skills as a leader of a tight, smaller unit. Harrell has made four albums with the current quintet of six years, which comprises tenor saxophonist [[Wayne Escoffery]], pianist [[Danny Grissett]], bassist [[Ugonna Okegwo]] who has performed with Harrell since 1997, and drummer Johnathan Blake.&lt;ref name="th-aaj-profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="th-roman-nights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=36196|title=Tom Harrell: Roman Nights (2010)|publisher=All About Jazz|date=April 18, 2010|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014085403/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=36196|archivedate=October 14, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is noted for the strong chemistry between the musicians and  the distinctive sound achieved primarily through Harrell's compositions.&lt;ref name="th-irish-times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2010/0709/1224274309183.html|title=Tom Harrell - Roman Nights|publisher=The Irish Times|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812230050/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2010/0709/1224274309183.html|archivedate=August 12, 2011|deadurl=no|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th-audiophile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audaud.com/2010/05/tom-harrell-roman-nights-high-note/|title=Tom Harrell - Roma Nights - High Note|publisher=Audiophile Audition|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228091655/http://audaud.com/2010/05/tom-harrell-roman-nights-high-note/|archivedate=December 28, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrell's current quintet differs from previous editions of quintets he has formed and worked with, in the use of Fender Rhodes and acoustic piano.&lt;ref name="th-jazziz2010"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jazziz.com/uploads/May2010/pageflip.html|title=22 May, 2010 ROMAN NIGHTS - Jazziz review|publisher=jazziz.com and tomharrell.com|date=May 22, 2010|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413125516/http://www.tomharrell.com/html/news.php|archivedate=April 13, 2013|deadurl=yes &lt;!--archived from, http://www.tomharrell.com/html/news.php --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrell's 2012 recording, ''[[Number Five (album)|Number Five]]'', received his seventh [[SESAC]] Jazz Award.&lt;ref name="th-sesac-awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sesac.com/News/News_Details.aspx?id=1670|title= SESAC Honors Music Greats at 8th Annual Jazz Awards Luncheon|publisher=SESAC|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728154533/http://www.sesac.com/News/News_Details.aspx?id=1670|archivedate=July 28, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tom Harrell Chamber Ensemble==
In June 2012, Harrell debuted his nine-piece chamber ensemble at the Highline Ballroom as part of the [[Blue Note Jazz Festival]].  Harrell arranged the music of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], and his own compositions for this ensemble, which consists of trumpet, soprano and tenor saxophones, c-flute and bass flute, violin, cello, acoustic guitar, piano, bass, and drums.&lt;ref name="th-aaj-profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="th-daily-news2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/nyc-style-jazz-meets-classical-music-muses-trumpeter-tom-harrell-article-1.981270|title=NYC-style jazz meets classical music|location=New York|work=Daily News|date=November 27, 2011|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119050022/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/nyc-style-jazz-meets-classical-music-muses-trumpeter-tom-harrell-article-1.981270|archivedate=November 19, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tom Harrell Chamber Ensemble has since performed at the Village Vanguard, Autumn Jazz Festival in Bielsko Biala, the Jazz Standard, the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival, the Scripps Auditorium in San Diego, and Soka University Performing Arts Center in Aliso Viejo, CA.

==''Colors of a Dream''==
In 2013, Harrell formed a piano-less sextet with two basses called ''Colors of a Dream'', which comprises himself on trumpet and flugelhorn, [[Wayne Escoffery]] on tenor saxophone, [[Jaleel Shaw]] on alto saxophone, Johnathan Blake on drums, [[Ugonna Okegwo]] on bass and [[Esperanza Spalding]] doubling on bass and vocal. The group debuted at the [[Village Vanguard]] during its six-night run starting March 26, 2013 and the second night's performance was webcast for live streaming by [[NPR]].&lt;ref name="th-npr2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/174986548/tom-harrells-colors-of-a-dream-live-at-the-village-vanguard|title=Tom Harrell's 'Colors Of A Dream': Live At The Village Vanguard|publisher=NPR.org|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110052603/http://www.npr.org/event/music/174986548/tom-harrells-colors-of-a-dream-live-at-the-village-vanguard|archivedate=January 10, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th-db2014" /&gt; A studio album by the same name was released on October 22, 2013 for which Harrell received his eighth [[SESAC]] Jazz Awards the following year.&lt;ref name="SESAC News"&gt;{{cite web|title=SESAC Honors Music Greats at 9th Annual Jazz Awards Luncheon|url=http://www.sesac.com/News/News_Details.aspx?id=2140|website=www.sesac.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th-allmusic-colors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/colors-of-a-dream-mw0002579683|title=Allmusic: Tom Harrell - Colors of a Dream - overview|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=June 29, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qh7Izo8v?url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/colors-of-a-dream-mw0002579683|archivedate=June 29, 2014|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TRIP==
Harrell also recorded with TRIP, a piano-less quartet featuring saxophonist [[Mark Turner (musician)|Mark Turner]], bassist Ugonna Okegwo and drummer Adam Cruz in 2013. The group first performed in Rochester, New York, and at the Jazz Standard during [[Dave Douglas (trumpeter)|Dave Douglas]]' Festival of New Trumpet Music (FONT) in October 2012. Harrell premiered the suite with six sections he wrote specifically for this group. TRIP reconvened a year later at the [[Village Vanguard]] and made a studio recording the following week.&lt;ref name="th-db2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downbeat.com/digitaledition/2014/DB1401/_art/DB1401.pdf|author=Phillip Lutz|title=Tom Harrell 'Magic Can Happen Anytime'|publisher=[[Down Beat|DownBeat Magazine]]|date=January 2014|pages=34–38|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="th-trip-roch-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exodustojazz.com/tom-harrell-quartet/|title=Rochester, NY: Exodus To Jazz presents Tom Harrell|publisher=exodustojazz.com|accessdate=October 26, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111002817/http://exodustojazz.com/tom-harrell-quartet/|archivedate=January 11, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quartet released the self-titled album ''TRIP'' on August 12, 2014.&lt;ref name="th-trip-am"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/trip-mw0002701860|title=Allmusic: Tom Harrell – Trip|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=August 26, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6S8565LKN?url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/trip-mw0002701860|archivedate=August 27, 2014|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the hacker group [[Goatse Security]], Auernheimer exposed a flaw in [[AT&amp;T]] security that compromised the e-mail addresses of [[iPad]] users. In revealing the flaw to the media, the group also exposed personal data from over 100,000 people, which led to a criminal investigation and indictment for [[identity fraud]] and conspiracy. Auernheimer was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison, of which he served approximately 13 months before the conviction was [[Vacated judgement|vacated]] by a higher court.

In 2016, Auernheimer was responsible for sending thousands of [[white-supremacist]] flyers to unsecured [[World Wide Web|web]]-connected printers at multiple universities and other locations in the U.S. Since his release from prison, he has lived in a variety of locations in Eastern Europe. In 2017, it was reported that he was acting as [[webmaster]] for the [[neo-Nazi]] website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]''.{{refn|name=Gutman}}{{refn|name=Windolf}}

== Early hacking and trolling ==
Auernheimer claimed responsibility for the reclassification of many books on gay issues as pornography on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s services in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen |last=Thomas |title=Why It Makes Sense That a Hacker's Behind Amazon's Big Gay Outrage |url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/5210142/why-it-makes-sense-that-a-hackers-behind-amazons-big-gay-outrage |newspaper=[[Gawker.com]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=April 13, 2009 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Geoffrey A. |last=Fowler |title=Did "Weev" Play a Role in Amazon "Error?" |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/04/14/did-weev-play-a-role-in-amazon-error/tab/article/ |newspaper=WSJ Blogs |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 14, 2009 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon said that he was not responsible for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen |last=Thomas |title=Amazon.com Says 'Embarrassing' Error, Not Hacker, Censored 57,310 Gay Books |url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/5210653/amazoncom-says-embarrassing-error-not-hacker-censored-57310-gay-books |newspaper=[[Gawker.com]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=April 13, 2009 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the Amazon incident, several media publications profiled him regarding his hacking and trolling activities, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he claimed to be a member of a hacker group called "the organization," making $10 million annually. He also claimed to be the owner of a [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls-Royce Phantom]].&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mattathias |last=Schwartz |title=The Trolls Among Us |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?_r=1 |newspaper=NYTimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=August 3, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen |last=Thomas |title=Journalists do it for the lulz |url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/5032989/journalists-do-it-for-the-lulz |newspaper=[[Gawker.com]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=August 3, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alex |last=Birch |title=Interview: Professional Hacker and Troll Weev |url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/weev |newspaper=Corrupt |publisher=CORRUPT.org |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ''Times'' story on Auernheimer was published, reporters sought him out for commentary on hacking-related stories. [[Gawker]] published a story on the [[Sarah Palin email hack]]ing incident and prominently featured Auernheimer's comments in the title of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moe |title=Hacker From That ''Times'' Story On Palin Emails: "i wish they'd done it properly" |url=http://gawker.com/5051974/hacker-from-that-times-story-on-palin-emails-i-wish-theyd-done-it-properly |newspaper=[[Gawker.com]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Auernheimer claimed responsibility in a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview for harassing the author and game developer [[Kathy Sierra]] in response to her "touchy" reaction to receiving threatening comments on her blog.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Citron"/&gt; This included posting a false account of her career online, including charges that she was a former sex worker, along with her home address and [[Social Security number]].&lt;ref name="Citron"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reagle"/&gt; The post instigated further harassment and abuse of Sierra, which led her to withdraw from online activity for several years.&lt;ref name="Poland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Souppouris |first=Aaron |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/12/4693710/the-end-of-kindness-weev-and-the-cult-of-the-angry-young-man |title=The end of kindness: weev and the cult of the angry young man |publisher=The Verge |date=2013-09-12 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AT&amp;T data breach ==
{{Main|Goatse Security}}
Auernheimer is a member of the group of computer experts known as "Goatse Security" that exposed a [[vulnerability (computing)|flaw]] in [[AT&amp;T]] security which allowed the e-mail addresses of [[iPad]] users to be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704312104575299111189853840?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection |title=FBI Opens Probe of iPad Breach |publisher=Wall Street Journal |author=Spencer Ante and Ben Worthen |date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to what it first claimed, the group revealed the security flaw to [[Gawker Media]] before AT&amp;T had been notified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Foresman |title=Goatse Security trolls were after "max lols" in AT&amp;T iPad hack |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/01/goatse-security-trolls-were-after-max-lols-in-att-ipad-hack/ |newspaper=[[Ars Technica]] |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also exposed the data of 114,000 iPad users, including those of celebrities, the government and the military. The group's actions rekindled public debate on the disclosure of security flaws.&lt;ref name=wsj14&gt;{{cite news |title=Computer Experts Face Backlash |first=Ben |last=Worthen |author2=Spencer E.

=== Investigation ===
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] opened an investigation into the incident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Tate |title=Apple's Worst Security Breach: 114,000 iPad Owners Exposed |url=http://gawker.com/5559346/apples-worst-security-breach-114000-ipad-owners-exposed |newspaper=[[Gawker.com]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a criminal complaint in January 2011 under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]].&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;United States District Court&amp;nbsp;— District Court of New Jersey, Docket: MAG 11-4022 (CCC). Filed with the court January 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the investigation was opened, Auernheimer's home in Arkansas was raided by the FBI and local police. The FBI search was related to its investigation of the AT&amp;T security breach, but he was subsequently detained on state drug charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Programmer Detained After FBI Search |first=Andrew |last=Dowell |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 17, 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704198004575310634055906968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police allege that, during their execution of the search warrant related to the AT&amp;T breach, they found [[cocaine]], [[MDMA|ecstasy]], [[LSD]], and [[Schedule II controlled substance|Schedule 2]] and 3 [[pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elinor |last=Mills |title=Hacker in AT&amp;T-iPad security case arrested on drug charges |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20007827-245.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 |newspaper=[[CNET News]] |publisher=[[CNET News]] |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on a $3,160 [[bail]] pending state trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jesse |last= Emspak |first2= Gabriel |last2=Perna |title=Arrested Hacker's Web Site Reveals Extremist Views |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/29267/20100617/goatse-hacker-blog-shows-extremist-views.htm |newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release on bail, he broke a [[gag order]] to protest what he maintained were violations of his civil rights. In particular, he disputed the legality of the search of his house and denial of access to a [[public defender]]. He also asked for donations via [[PayPal]], to defray legal costs.&lt;ref name="Leyden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pharisees"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypocrites and Pharisees|url=http://security.goatse.fr/hypocrites-and-pharisees|publisher=Goatse.fr|author=weev|date=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, all drug-related charges were dropped immediately following Auernheimer's arrest by federal authorities. The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] announced that he would be charged with one count of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization and one count of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Criminal charges filed against AT&amp;T iPad attackers|date=January 18, 2011 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9205403/Criminal_charges_filed_against_AT_T_iPad_attackers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his co-defendant, Daniel Spitler, was quickly released on bail, Auernheimer was initially denied bail because of his unemployment and lack of a family member to host him. He was incarcerated in the [[Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City]] before being released on $50,000 bail in late February 2011.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=bailtime&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=David|title=Suspect in iPad Data Theft Released on Bail in NJ|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=13023509|accessdate=March 2, 2011|newspaper=ABC News|date=February 28, 2011|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Indictment ===
A federal [[grand jury]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], indicted Auernheimer with one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computers and one count of [[identity theft]] in July 2011.&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stempel|first=Jonathan|title=iPad hacker Andrew Auernheimer indicted by Newark grand jury|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/06/ipad-hacker-andrew-auernheimer-indictment_n_891673.html|accessdate=September 12, 2011|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=July 6, 2011|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, he was freed on bail and raising money for his legal defense fund.&lt;ref name=cnetdefensefund&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Elinor|title=AT&amp;T-iPad site hacker to fight it on in court|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20105097-245/at-t-ipad-site-hacker-to-fight-on-in-court-exclusive|accessdate=September 12, 2011|newspaper=CNET News|date=September 12, 2011|agency=CNET News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 20, 2012, Auernheimer was found guilty of one count of identity fraud and one count of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/11/att-hacker-found-guilty/|title=Hacker Found Guilty of Breaching AT&amp;amp;T Site to Obtain iPad Customer Data |work=Threat Level |publisher=Wired |last=Zetter |first=Kim |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2012, Auernheimer wrote an article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' entitled "Forget Disclosure – Hackers Should Keep Security Holes to Themselves," advocating the disclosure of any [[Zero-day attack|zero-day exploit]] only to individuals who will "use it in the interests of social justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/11/hacking-choice-and-disclosure/ |title=Forget Disclosure — Hackers Should Keep Security Holes to Themselves |work=Wired |last=Auernheimer |first=Andrew |date=November 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 2013 [[TechCrunch]] article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/21/ipad-hack-statement-of-responsibility/| title=iPad Hack Statement of Responsibility | date=January 23, 2013 | accessdate=January 28, 2013|first=Andrew|last=Auernheimer|publisher=techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; he likened his prosecution to that of [[Aaron Swartz]], writing

{{quote|[...]Aaron dealt with his indictment so badly because he thought he was part of a special class of people that this didn't happen to. I am from a rundown shack in Arkansas. I spent many years thinking people from families like his got better treatment than me. Now I realize the truth: The beast is so monstrous it will devour us all.}}

On March 18, 2013, after being found guilty of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization, Auernheimer was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $73,000 in restitution.&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/att-hacker-gets-3-years/| title=iPad Hack Statement Of Responsibility | date=January 23, 2013 | accessdate=March 18, 2013|first=Kim|last=Zetter|publisher=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just prior to his sentencing, he posted an "Ask Me Anything" thread on [[Reddit]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ahkgc/i_am_weev_i_may_be_going_to_prison_under_the/ |work=[[Reddit]] |author=weev |title=I am weev. I may be going to prison under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act tomorrow at my sentencing. AMA. |date=March 17, 2013 |accessdate=April 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; comments such as "I hope they give me the maximum, so people will rise up and storm the docks" and "My regret is being nice enough to give AT&amp;T a chance to patch before dropping the dataset to Gawker. I won't nearly be as nice next time" were cited by the prosecution the next day in court as justification for the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/18/4118484/andrew-weev-auernheimer-sentenced-att-ipad-hack |title=Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer sentenced to 41 months for exploiting AT&amp;T iPad security flaw |last=Brian |first=Matt |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 30, 2013 |work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in March 2013, civil rights lawyer and [[George Washington University Law School]] faculty [[Orin Kerr]] joined Auernheimer's legal team, free of charge.&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|last=Crook|first=Jordan|title=Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer Obtains New Lawyer, Files Appeal|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/weev-files-appeal-gets-new-lawyer/|publisher=TechCrunch|date=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auernheimer was serving his sentence at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood Low]], a low-security federal prison in Pennsylvania, and was scheduled for release in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inmate Locator: Register # 10378-010|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=andrew&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=auernheimer&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=-528&amp;y=-497|publisher=Federal Bureau of Prisons|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 1, 2013, his legal team filed a brief with the [[Third Circuit Court of Appeals]], arguing that his convictions should be reversed because he had not violated the relevant provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volokh.com/2013/07/01/appellants-brief-filed-in-united-states-v-auernheimer/ |title=Appellant's Brief Filed in United States v.

On April 11, 2014, the Third Circuit issued an opinion [[Vacated judgment|vacating]] Auernheimer's conviction, on the basis that the venue in New Jersey was improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/auernheimer-op-usca3.pdf |title=Case: 13-1816 Document: 003111586090 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArsTech&gt;{{cite news|last=Kravets|first=David|title=Appeals court reverses hacker/troll "weev" conviction and sentence|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/04/appeals-court-reverses-hackertroll-weev-conviction-and-sentence/|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the judges did not address the substantive question on the legality of the site access, they were skeptical of the original conviction, noting that no circumvention of passwords had occurred and that only publicly accessible information was obtained.&lt;ref name=Frbz&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Kashmir|title=Weev Freed, But Court Punts On Bigger 'Hacking vs. Security Research' Question|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/04/appeals-court-reverses-hackertroll-weev-conviction-and-sentence/|accessdate=April 11, 2014|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from prison on April 11, 2014.&lt;ref name=BBerg&gt;{{cite news|last=Voreacos|first=David|title=AT&amp;T Hacker 'Weev' Parties and Tweets as Case Still Looms|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-14/at-t-hacker-weev-wants-indictment-tossed-after-prison-release.html|accessdate=April 14, 2014|newspaper=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After prison ==
In October 2014, Auernheimer published an article in the neo-Nazi blog ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' in which he revealed himself to be a [[white nationalist]]. He displayed photographs of his tattoos, one in the shape of a [[swastika]]. He described his prison time as "thousands of hours yelling the [[Edda]]s at the top of my lungs and scrawling [[rune]]s on the concrete walls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystormer.com/what-i-learned-from-my-time-in-prison/|title=What I Learned from My Time in Prison|author=Andrew Anglin|work=Daily Stormer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he told ''[[Gawker]]'' that he had Jewish ancestry, and also claimed to have converted to Mormonism. According to ''Gawker'', "Auernheimer deploys a peculiar rhetorical strategy that he's learned to work to his advantage: he peppers his conversation with bizarre but true facts and historical references—he has an encyclopedic knowledge of ancient Greek history, world religions and contemporary U.S. anti-government extremists, among other things—then hits you with dubious details about his own life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Adrien|title=The Internet's Best Terrible Person Goes to Jail: Can a Reviled Master Troll Become a Geek Hero?|url=http://gawker.com/5962159/the-internets-best-terrible-person-goes-to-jail-can-a-reviled-master-troll-become-a-geek-hero|website=Gawker.com|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[PandoDaily]]'', Auernheimer was living in Lebanon as of 2014 in order to avoid prosecution in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pando.com/2014/11/21/troll-tales-catching-up-with-weev-in-beirut/|title='weev' in Beirut: I can't go home until "most of the agents of the federal government are dead."|work=PandoDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he told an interviewer that he was living in [[Kharkiv]], Ukraine.&lt;ref name="alphaville"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alphavilleherald.com/2016/09/interview-with-alt-right-pepemancer-and-kektrump-supporter-weev.html|title=Interview with alt-right Pepemancer and Kek/Trump supporter, weev|last1=Ludlow|first1=Peter|website=alphavilleherald.com|publisher=The Alphaville Herald|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], he was reported to have left Ukraine in 2017 for [[Tiraspol]], the capital of [[Transnistria]], self-proclaimed republic in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/andrew-weev-auernheimer |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |location=Montgomery, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Auernheimer published the names of U.S. government employees who were exposed by the [[Adult FriendFinder]] and [[Ashley Madison]] data breaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Brownlee, Lisa|title=Ashley Madison Users: Just When You Thought It Was Safe, Hactivist Ups The Ante|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisabrownlee/2015/10/09/ashley-madison-users-just-when-you-thought-it-was-safe-hactivist-ups-the-ante/|publisher=''Forbes''|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mullin, Joe|title="Weev" threatens prosecutors with info from Ashley Madison leaks|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/weev-threatens-prosecutors-with-info-from-ashley-madison-leaks/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told CNN, "I went straight for government employees because they seem the easiest to shame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/22/technology/adult-friendfinder-hacked/index.html |title=Adult dating site hack exposes sexual secrets of millions |last1=Goldman |first1=David |last2=Pagliery |first2=Jose |date=22 May 2015 |website=CNN |publisher=Time Warner |access-date=25 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has also been involved in the release of the [[Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy|undercover Planned Parenthood videos]], which were under a temporary restraining order. The ''Washington Post'' quoted him as saying he did it "For the lulz."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miller, Michael E. |title=Controversial blogger, infamous hacker team up to release remaining Planned Parenthood videos |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/23/controversial-blogger-infamous-hacker-team-up-to-release-remaining-planned-parenthood-videos/ |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=10 November 2015 |date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of incidents in 2016, Auernheimer sent flyers adorned with racist and [[anti-Semitic]] messages to thousands of unsecured printers across the U.S.; flyers bearing [[swastika]]s and promoting ''The Daily Stormer'' were sent to several universities.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; He also claimed responsibility for 50,000 flyers sent to printers across the U.S., urging the killing of black and Jewish children and praising [[Anders Behring Breivik]], who killed 77 people in a pair of terrorist attacks in Norway in 2011. He claimed to have used a tool to scour the Internet for unsecured printers, finding over a million vulnerable devices.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/infamous-hacker-weev-says-he-blasted-college-printers-antisemitic-message-n547001 |title=Infamous Hacker 'Weev' Says He Blasted College Printers With Antisemitic Message |last1=Johnson |first1=Alex |website=NBC News |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An email leak by [[BuzzFeed News]] in October 2017 revealed that weev was in contact with [[Breitbart News]] personality [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], who had asked weev for advice on an article about the [[alt-right]]. It was also revealed that Yiannopoulos had asked his editor for permission for weev to appear on his podcast, which was rejected as the editor did not want Breitbart to associate with a "legit racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernstein|first1=Joseph|title=Here's How Breitbart And Milo Smuggled Nazi and White Nationalist Ideas Into The Mainstream|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism|accessdate=19 October 2017|publisher=BuzzFeed News|date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handel created the first version of his will with nine years to live, and completed his will (with the final codicil) three days before his death. Handel's will begins with the following text:

==Handel's funeral==
In the final codicil to his will (item 39 in the above table), Handel expressed a desire to be buried in the following manner:

{{Quotation|align=center|I hope I have the permission of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster to be buried in Westminster Abbey, in a private manner, at the discretion of my executor, Mr. Amyand; and I desire that my said executor may have leave to erect a monument for me there, and that any sum not exceeding six hundred pounds, be expended for that purpose, at the discretion of my said executor.|G.F.Handel|}}

Handel was buried in the south wing of [[Westminster Abbey]], and his funeral took place on Friday 20 April 1759. The funeral service was performed by Dr. Zachary Pearce ([[Bishop of Rochester]]), and took place in the presence of more than 3,000 visitors. The choirs of the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], and Westminster Abbey sang the Funeral Anthem of [[William Croft]].
