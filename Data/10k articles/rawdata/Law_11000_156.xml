[[File:Demonstration of supporters of changes to the law on the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland 13 12 2015.JPG|thumb|250px|A pro-government [[Law and Justice]] rally in support of the new Constitutional Tribunal legislation, 13 December 2015]]
The '''Polish Constitutional Court crisis of 2015''' is a political conflict which began in [[Poland]] in October 2015 with the appointment of five [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]] judges by the [[Civic Platform]] (Platforma Obywatelska, PO) party. {{As of|2017|12|20}}, the crisis had, according to the [[European Commission]], extended to include "13 laws affecting the entire structure of the justice system in Poland".&lt;ref name="CE_20171220" /&gt; The Constitutional Tribunal changes included the replacement of three judges whose terms were not due to expire until after the first possible date of meeting of the new parliament and two judges whose terms were not due to expire until after the last possible date of meeting of the new parliament. According to Polish law, judges of the [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]] are to be elected by the parliament which is sitting when the terms of the previous judges expire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/polski/kon1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Civic Platform was predicted to lose the upcoming elections. After the [[Law and Justice]] (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, PiS) party won the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|parliamentary election]], it made its own appointments to the court, arguing that the previous appointments of the five judges by PO were unconstitutional. In December, PiS changed the court's decision-making power by prescribing a two-thirds majority vote and mandatory participation of at least 13 of the 15 judges on the Constitutional Tribunal. The appointments and amendments caused domestic protests and counter-protests in late December and early January; one of the most significant outcomes was the creation of the [[Committee for the Defence of Democracy]] protest movement. The law changes were criticized by [[European Commission]] as threatening the rule of law and the human rights of Polish citizens.&lt;ref name="CE_20171220" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2016/01/13/bruxelles-lance-une-enquete-preliminaire-inedite-sur-la-situation-de-l-etat-de-droit-en-pologne_4846618_3214.html|title=Bruxelles lance une enquête préliminaire inédite sur la situation de l’Etat de droit en Pologne|date=2016-01-13|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|language=fr|issn=1950-6244|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
On June 25, 2015, the government adopted a new law regarding the constitutional court.&lt;ref&gt;http://fakty.interia.pl/raporty/raport-spor-wokol-tk/komentarze/news-spor-o-tk-katastrofa-europejskiego-projektu-integracyjnego,nId,2212494 Spór o TK "katastrofą europejskiego projektu integracyjnego"?&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Constitution Court found this law as partly unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;http://trybunal.gov.pl/postepowanie-i-orzeczenia/wyroki/art/8748-ustawa-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym/&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed by the president on July 21, 2015 (ca. one month before end of presidency) .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obserwatorkonstytucyjny.pl/trybunal/prezydent-podpisal-ustawe-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym/ Prezydent podpisał ustawę o Trybunale Konstytucyjnym&lt;/ref&gt; On October 8, 2015 the outgoing Polish Parliament ([[Sejm]]), on last meeting day,  led by Civic Platform (PO) as the main party of the governing coalition, elected five new [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]] judges. Three of them replaced judges whose nine-year terms were to expire on November 6 (almost two weeks after elections), while two were to replace judges whose terms were due to expire in December.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rp.pl/Sedziowie-i-sady/311069942-Wygasaja-kadencje-trojga-sedziow-Trybunalu-Konstytucyjnego.html/ rp.pl&lt;/ref&gt; The judges were chosen on the basis of a law passed earlier in the summer, by the PO-controlled Sejm. At the time of the judges' election, opinion polls had shown that the Civic Platform was likely to lose the upcoming [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|Polish parliamentary election]] on October 25.&lt;ref name=fakt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fakt.pl/politycy/awantura-o-trybunal-konstytucyjny,artykuly,593265.html|title=Awantura o Trybunał Konstytucyjny|work=fakt.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polska.newsweek.pl/ustawa-pis-o-trybunale-konstytucyjnym-zaskarzona-do-trybunalu-konstytucyjnego,artykuly,374563,1.html|title=Ustawa PiS o Trybunale Konstytucyjnym zaskarżona do Trybunału Konstytucyjnego - Polska - Newsweek.pl|work=Newsweek.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the judges appointed by PO had taken their seats on the Tribunal, the result would have been that 14 out of 15 Constitutional Tribunal judges would have been selected by the Civic Platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2015-12-04/jaki-o-tk-14-z-15-sedziow-bylo-zwiazanych-z-po/|title=Jaki o TK: 14 z 15 sędziów było związanych z PO|work=polsatnews.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the President of Poland, [[Andrzej Duda]], refused to swear in these judges&lt;ref name="ppb"&gt;[https://polishpoliticsblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/31/who-is-winning-polands-constitutional-tribunal-war/]&lt;/ref&gt; stating that they had been chosen "in contravention of democratic principles".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polsatnews.pl/wiadomosc/2015-11-16/po-apeluje-do-dudy-o-zaprzysiezenie-sedziow-trybunalu-konstytucyjnego/]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, the [[Law and Justice]] (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość, PiS) party won an unprecedented absolute majority of seats in the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|Polish parliamentary election]].&lt;ref name=POL/&gt; On November 16, new Prime Minister [[Beata Szydło]] and her Cabinet took power.&lt;ref name=slt&gt;VANESSA GERA [http://www.sltrib.com/home/3254986-155/new-polish-government-sparks-constitutional-crisis New Polish government sparks constitutional crisis] The Associated Press, The Salt Lake Tribune, 2 December 2015, retrieved 22 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election of Constitutional Court judges==
On November 19, 2015 the new Sejm passed an amendment to the existing law, and mandated the appointment of five new judges, set term limits for the president and vice president of the court, and stipulated term limits for two sitting judges. The president, [[Andrzej Duda]], signed the amendment on November 20, but the law was challenged at the Constitutional Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/1546853,Prezydent-Andrzej-Duda-podpisal-nowelizacje-ustawy-o-Trybunale-Konstytucyjnym-Wejdzie-w-zycie-5-grudnia |title=Prezydent Andrzej Duda podpisał nowelizację ustawy o Trybunale Konstytucyjnym.

On December 2, the Sejm elected five new judges to the 15-member tribunal, claiming it would prevent the previously appointed five from taking office;&lt;ref name=slt/&gt; these were sworn into office by President Duda in a closed ceremony held after midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/law-vs-justice-poland-constitution-judges/|title=Poland's 'overnight court' breaks all the rules|last=Kisilowski|first=Maciej|date=2015-12-08|website=POLITICO|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-poland-taking-an-authoritarian-turn-its-new-president-explains/2016/03/24/f29e8830-f114-11e5-89c3-a647fcce95e0_story.html|title=Is Poland taking an authoritarian turn?

On 3 December the Constitutional Court ruled that out of the five judges elected by PO, the election of three judges was valid, while the appointment of the other two breached the law. Again, President Duda refused to swear any of these judges into office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbj.pl/president-duda-wont-implement-constitutional-tribunal-ruling/| title=President Duda won't implement constitutional tribunal ruling| publisher=Warsaw Business Journal| date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his spokesman, Duda refused to swear these three judges into office, because the number of Constitutional Court judges would then be unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=POL&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.politico.eu/article/poland-constitution-crisis-kaczynski-duda/ |title=Poland’s constitutional crisis goes international |first=Jan| last=Cienski| publisher=Politico |date=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/polands-ruling-party-seeks-to-replace-judges-who-have-final-say-on-laws-1448547025|title=Poland’s Ruling Party Seeks to Replace Judges Who Have Final Say on Laws |publisher=Wall Street Journal |first=Martin|last=Sobczyk|date=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/poland-constitution-idUSL8N13R2LD20151203 | title=Tussle over judges turns into constitutional crisis in Poland| publisher=Reuters| first1=Wiktor |last1=Szary |first2=Justyna |last2=Pawlak |date=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/constitutional-crisis-in-poland-intensifies-over-judicial-jobs-1.2463635 |title=Constitutional crisis in Poland intensifies over judicial jobs |first=Derek| last=Scally| publisher=The Irish Times |date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/polands-new-right-wing-leaders-cross-a-line/2015/12/22/54d42ea4-a8d3-11e5-8058-480b572b4aae_story.html| title= Poland’s new right-wing leaders have crossed a line| publisher=Washington Post| date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/polish-government-policies-risk-civil-war-former-leader-walesa-says/a-18926068| title=Polish government policies risk 'civil war,' former leader Walesa says| publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]| date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December, Law and Justice leader [[Jaroslaw Kaczyński]], who had called the Constitutional Court "the bastion of everything in Poland that is bad"&lt;ref name=POL/&gt; questioned the legitimacy of the Court's decision, because it was supposedly made by fewer judges than required by law. Kaczyński announced changes in the law regarding the Constitutional Court, but gave no details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/battle-between-polish-government-and-top-court-escalates-1449859307 |title=Battle Between Polish Government and Top Court Escalates |publisher=Wall Street Journal |first=Martin|last=Sobczyk|date=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2016, the Constitutional Court rejected a complaint by Civic Platform questioning the appointment of the five new judges by the new Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskatimes.pl/artykul/9278445,trybunal-konstytucyjny-umorzyl-skarge-na-uchwaly-sejmu,id,t.html |title=Trybunał Konstytucyjny umorzył skargę na uchwały Sejmu |website=Polskatimes.pl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the Court's judges dissented, including [[Andrzej Rzepliński]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://fakty.interia.pl/raporty/raport-spor-wokol-tk/newsy/news-trybunal-konstytucyjny-umorzyl-sprawe-dot-powolania-5-sedzio,nId,1952685 |title=Trybunał Konstytucyjny umorzył sprawę dot. powołania 5 sędziów |website=Fakty.interia.pl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional court law changes==
[[File:Warszawa t konstytucyjny.jpg|thumb|The Constitutional Court in Warsaw]]
On 22 December 2015 the Sejm passed a law which reorganised the Constitutional Court. The new law introduced a two-thirds majority&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; and the mandatory participation of at least 13, instead of 9, of the 15 judges.&lt;ref name=Goe&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/poland-constitution-crisis-idUSL8N14B2UG20151222|title=Polish parliament passes contentious amendment to top court law| publisher=Reuters| first=Marcin |last=Goettig |date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/projekt-nowalizacji-ustawy-o-tk-w-sejmie,603330.html |title=Projekt nowalizacji ustawy o TK w Sejmie |website=Tvn24.pl |date=2015-12-16 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art. 190 (5) of the [[Constitution of Poland|Polish Constitution]] requires only the majority of votes.&lt;ref name=NZZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/international/europa/in-polen-waechst-der-widerstand-1.18666282|title=In Polen wächst der Widerstand|first=Meret|last=Baumann|publisher=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] |date=21 December 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, pending constitutional proceedings had previously to wait in the docket{{clarify|date=January 2017}} for six months, or under exceptional circumstances for three months. The Court is now bound to handle the cases according to the date of receipt. Judges of the Constitutional Court can be dismissed on request of the Sejm, the President or the Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/nach-dem-machtwechsel-regierung-in-polen-entmachtet-verfassungsgericht/12758070.html|title=Regierung in Polen entmachtet Verfassungsgericht|first=Paul|last=Flückiger|publisher=[[Tagesspiegel]] |date=23 December 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was approved by the [[Polish Senate]] on 24 December 2015 after an overnight session, and signed by President Duda on 28 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/24/poland-senate-votes-constitutional-court |title=Poland’s senate votes to curb power of top court| publisher=The Guardian| date=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/polands-president-signs-constitutional-court-bill-amendment/a-18945179|title=Poland’s president signs constitutional court bill amendment|publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that as a result, the decision-making capacity of the court has been "paralysed".&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Gera [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/rights-official-polands-constitutional-court-paralyzed/2016/02/12/efa5490c-d184-11e5-90d3-34c2c42653ac_story.html Rights official: Poland’s constitutional court ‘paralyzed’.] Associated Press, The Washington Post, February 12, 2016, retrieved 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2016 the Constitutional Court ruled the amendments non-compliant with the Polish constitution. The Polish government regards this verdict as not binding, as it was not based on the rules introduced by the amendment, and refused to publish the verdict, a binding condition for its legal validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/poland-constitutional-court-law-and-justice-government-reforms|title=Poland's legal reforms do not comply with constitution, court rules|publisher=The Guardian |date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35793914|title=Polish protests as government rejects court ruling|publisher=BBC news |date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic reaction==
[[File:Demonstracja Komitetu Obrony Demokracji 04.JPG|thumb|200px|A [[Committee for the Defence of Democracy]] protest in Warsaw against Poland's new government, 12 December 2015]]
On December 2, Jacek Kucharczyk, the director of the [[Institute of Public Affairs, Poland]] in Warsaw, was quoted as saying that the constitutional court "was the one branch of government that they (PiS) theoretically couldn't touch and which curbed its power 10 years ago".&lt;ref name=slt/&gt;

On December 12, protests organised by the [[Committee for the Defence of Democracy]] were joined by a crowd of supporters (estimated at 50,000 by the event organisers and 17,000-20,000 according to the official police report) in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-protests-idUSKBN0TV0PW20151213 |title=Thousands march against Polish government as constitutional spat drags on| publisher=Reuters| first1=Wiktor |last1=Szary |first2=Pawel |last2=Florkiewicz |date=12 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day pro-government supporters rallied in the capital (estimated at 80,000 by the event organisers and 40,000-45,000 based on the official police report).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Polskie|first1=Radio|title=Freedom and Solidarity March|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/1557179,Potrzebna-jest-wielka-przebudowa-Polski-Marsz-Wolnosci-i-Solidarnosci-przeszedl-ulicami-Warszawy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Poland]] and the Polish Lawyers Association view the amendment as a breach of Article 190 and as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=NZZ/&gt;

[[Lech Wałęsa]], former President of Poland and leader of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in the 1980s, stated that the current situation might lead to a civil war and that the way in which PiS was proceeding did not amount to an "open and democratic" reform process. Wałęsa called for a referendum on the latest changes of law. "This government acts against Poland, against our achievements, freedom, democracy, not to mention the fact that it ridicules us in the world...I’m ashamed to travel abroad."&lt;ref name=DW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/23/poland-constitutional-crisis-lech-walesa-law-justice-pis |title=Poland: Lech Wałęsa warns against 'undemocratic' curbs on court| publisher=The Guardian| date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2016, [[Leszek Miller]] the former Prime Minister of Poland criticised Western, especially German, media, and other critics of PiS, saying that they were "hysterical" and that there was nothing to indicate a "coup", as PiS was simply regaining power from the Civic Platform. Miller accused the chief judge of the Constitutional Court [[Andrzej Rzepliński]] of acting like a "politician of Civic Platform".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/miller-pis-nie-dokonuje-zamachu-stanu-zachodnie-media-histeryzuja,608186.html |title=Miller: PiS nie dokonuje zamachu stanu.

In an open letter published on 25 April 2016, the former Presidents of Poland, Lech Wałęsa, [[Aleksander Kwasniewski]] and [[Bronislaw Komorowski]], called on the Polish public to defend democracy, and warned that "Law and Justice plans to continue their actions, which destroy the constitutional order, paralyze the proceedings of the Constitutional Tribunal and the entire judicial system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/world/europe/poland-lech-walesa-law-and-justice.html?_r=0|title=Ex-Presidents of Poland Issue a Rebuke to the Governing Party|publisher=New York Times| date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same week Poland's Supreme Court announced that it regards the verdicts of the Constitutional Tribunal as binding even though these decisions were not published by the Government, as "technically" required by the Polish Constitution. In response PiS spokeswoman Beata Mazurek called the Supreme Court's statement the result of "a meeting of a team of cronies who are defending the status quo of the previous governing camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/pressure-mounts-on-polish-government-over-top-court-1461952946|title=Pressure Mounts on Polish Government Over Top Court |publisher=Wall Street Journal| date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2015, [[Martin Schulz]], President of the [[European Parliament]], described the political situation in Poland as dramatic, with the latest actions of the Polish government having "characteristics of a coup". Schulz explicitly refused to withdraw this appraisal after protests by the Polish Prime Minister [[Beata Szydło]] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Witold Waszczykowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/12051752/EU-parliament-head-refuses-to-apologise-over-coup-comment-after-Polish-PM-request.html|title=EU parliament head refuses to apologise over 'coup' comment after Polish PM request| publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]| first=Mathew |last=Day |date=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10 Schulz was quoted as describing the situation in Poland as a "[[Putin]]isation" of European politics; and he was backed by [[Viviane Reding]], who complained about attacks on the public and private media in line with "the Putin-Orbán-Kaczynski-Logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/europa/martin-schulz-greift-polnische-politik-an-14005694.html|title=Das ist gelenkte Demokratie nach Putins Art| publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]| language=German |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commission]] Vice President [[Frans Timmermans]] wrote in a letter to Poland's ministers of Justice and Foreign Affairs before Christmas, that the EU's executive body "attaches great importance to preventing the emergence of situations whereby the rule of law in (a) member state could be called into question",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/eu-warns-poland-on-rule-of-law-as-constitutional-crisis-escalates/a-18937977 | title= EU warns Poland on rule of law as constitutional crisis escalates| publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]| date=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he "would expect that this law is not finally adopted or at least not put into force until all questions regarding the impact of this law on the independence and the functioning of the Constitutional Tribunal have been fully and properly assessed."&lt;ref name=POL/&gt;

[[Anne Brasseur]], President of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], called on Polish politicians "not to enact, precipitously, legislation relating to the Constitutional Tribunal which may seriously undermine the rule of law."&lt;ref name=Goe/&gt;

On 9 January [[Volker Kauder]] and [[Herbert Reul]], both political leaders of the German parties [[CDU/CSU]], threatened Poland with economic sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gremi Business Communication Sp. z o.o. |url=http://www.rp.pl/Polityka/160109457-Partia-Merkel-zirytowana-dzialaniami-PiS.html |title=Partia Merkel zirytowana działaniami PiS-Polityka |website=Rp.pl |date=2015-12-20 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday January 11, the press spokesman for the German government, Steffen Seibert, denied that this was the position of the German government and stated that sanctions were not in fact being considered.&lt;ref name="tvn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-ze-swiata,2/niemcy-nie-rozwazaja-nalozenia-na-polske-sankcji,609728.html |title=Niemcy nie rozważają nałożenia na Polskę sankcji |website=Tvn24.pl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; German European MP [[Hans-Olaf Henkel]] from the conservative [[Alliance for Progress and Renewal]] party criticized German interference in Polish internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpolityce.pl/polityka/277081-eurodeputowany-hans-olaf-henkel-polacy-nie-potrzebuja-dobrych-rad-niemcow-urzadzajac-nagonke-na-pis-niemieccy-chadecy-wspieraja-po-swojego-politycznego-sojusznika-nasz-wywiad |title=Eurodeputowany Hans-Olaf Henkel: "Polacy nie potrzebują dobrych rad Niemców.

On 8 January Viktor Orbán, the [[Prime Minister of Hungary]], declared that Hungary would never agree to any sanctions against Poland, and would veto any proposals to do so in EU. Orbán declared, "The European Union should not think about applying any sort of sanctions against Poland because that would require full unanimity and Hungary will never support any sort of sanctions against Poland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0390ad5a-b60d-11e5-8358-9a82b43f6b2f.html#axzz3wgvpbuNs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111074735/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0390ad5a-b60d-11e5-8358-9a82b43f6b2f.html#axzz3wgvpbuNs |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-01-11 |accessdate=January 8, 2016 |title=Archived copy |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under current EU law, to sanction any member state, all other member states must give their supporting vote.

On 13 January 2016 the European Commission launched a formal rule-of-law assessment based on rules set out in 2014 and the provisions of [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union]], regarding the amendments of the constitutional court and the public media law in Poland. The assessment could, theoretically, lead to Poland being stripped of its voting rights in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/ec-to-investigate-polish-governments-controversial-new-laws |title=Brussel launches unprecedented EU inquiry into rule of law in Poland| publisher=The Guardian| date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recommendation, the second step in the rule-of-law assessment, was issued on 1 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-2017_en.htm (Commission Recommendation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/poland-gets-official-warning-from-eu-over-constitutional-court-changes|title=Poland gets official warning from EU over constitutional court changes|publisher=The Guardian| date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iverna McGowan, director of Amnesty International's European Institutes office in Brussels, commented: "The willingness of the commission to use the rule-of-law framework is a positive step towards a more serious approach by the EU to speak out and hold its own member states to account on their human rights records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/eu-begins-assessment-of-poland-over-controversial-new-laws-1.2495394 |title=EU begins assessment of Poland over controversial new laws| publisher=The Irish Times| date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary declared that it will oppose any sanctions against Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvp.info/23588427/blaszczak-zadne-sankcje-na-polske-nie-zostana-nalozone|title=Błaszczak: żadne sankcje na Polskę nie zostaną nałożone|author=dmilo, k|date=14 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] downgraded Poland's rating from A- to BBB+ because, according to a S&amp;P spokesman, "the downgrade reflects our view that Poland's system of institutional checks and balances has been eroded significantly.

In a letter addressed to Beata Szydło, [[US Senator]]s [[John McCain]], [[Ben Cardin]] and [[Richard J. Durbin]] protested against the amendments which would "threaten the independence of state media and the country's highest court and undermine Poland's role as a democratic model for other countries in the region still going through difficult transitions" and could "serve to diminish democratic norms, including the rule of law and independence of the judiciary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/polands-top-court-to-rule-on-constitutional-crisis/2016/03/09/bb5a39ac-e5d7-11e5-a9ce-681055c7a05f_story.html|title=Polish constitutional court strikes down new rules on court|author=Vanessa Gera|date=9 March 2016|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-usa-idUSKCN0VN0ZG|title=U.S. senators urge Poland to respect democracy, rule of law|publisher=Reuters|date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 2016 the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Venice Commission]], who had been asked for an opinion by the Polish government in December 2015, assessed the amendments as crippling the Court's effectiveness and undermining democracy, human rights and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wbj.pl/venice-commission-criticizes-changes-to-top-constitutional-court/|title=Venice Commission criticizes changes to top constitutional court|author=Warsaw Business Journal|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April 2016 the European Parliament, by 513 votes to 142 and with 30 abstentions, passed a resolution declaring that the Parliament "is seriously concerned that the effective paralysis of the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland endangers democracy, human rights and the rule of law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/world/europe/poland-eu-parliament.html?_r=0 |title=EU accuses Polish Government of undermining Democracy|publisher=New York Times| date=13 April 2016}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-eu-parliament-idUSKCN0XA1BH |title=Poland court 'paralysis' threatens democracy|publisher=Reuters|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2017 [[Nigel Farage]], British politician, openly attacked the [[European Commission]] in EU parliament by saying: “Indeed, the way you are treating Poland and Hungary already must remind them of living under the Soviet Communists with your attempts to tell them how they should run their own countries.

On 28 February 2018 [[Nigel Farage]], British politician, said: "I am always hearing about human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and yet in 2011, when journalists in Poland were being apprehended, held and sacked for being critical of the Government, what did the Commission do? Nothing. Why? Well, of course, because Mr Tusk, as the then Prime Minister, was pro the European Union.

Nine hundred and fifty people get beaten up by the police because they want to turn out on a Sunday morning and express an opinion – a totally clear violation, Mr Timmermans, of people’s human rights, an absolute abuse of any sense of a democratic process – yet you say, in that case, that it is none of our business. But, of course, they are a pro-EU Government, so the iron fist of the European Union is reserved purely for your critics.”  He finished with comparison to the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]]: "This, for Poland, is the modern-day Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty. You rebelled against that system, Polish people, and I hope you go on and rebel against this one.”

On 9 March 2018 leaders of the [[Baltic states]] expressed their support for law reform in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/baltic-states-against-eu-sanctions-on-poland/| title = Baltic states against EU sanctions on Poland EURACTIV.com | date = 13 March 2018 | publisher = www.euractiv.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania’s Prime Minister [[Saulius Skvernelis]] expressed understanding for law changes in Poland: "we understand Poland, we understand its goals related to the reform of the justice system (...) if there were any restrictive measures imposed on Poland, Lithuania would support Poland”. The Prime Minister of Latvia [[Māris Kučinskis]] said: "We would be against any punishments imposed on Poland; in this regard, all three Baltic countries think similarly". Estonian Prime Minister [[Jüri Ratas]] said that "Any problems related to voting and taking away the right to vote – I do not think that it should happen at all, it would be a step too far".

On 13 September 2018 Lithuanian Foreign Minister, [[Linas Antanas Linkevičius]] has re-confirmed Lithuania's stand: "We will oppose the sanctions against Poland. This dialogue is very complicated but we believe that the result will be positive. Our neighbors also want to improve relations with the European Union in the context of the rule of law. Ultimatums and strong reactions will not help to solve this issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://uawire.org/lithuania-will-not-support-the-eu-sanctions-against-poland | title = UAWire - Lithuania promises not support the EU sanctions against Poland | date = 14 September 2018 | publisher = uawire.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic response to German and EU criticism===
[[Prime Minister]] [[Beata Szydlo]] vowed not to bow to German pressure, saying "these attacks are intended to weaken us, trying to show us that we should agree to everything just like our predecessors did". While German-Polish relations are important, Szydlo pointed out that they must be based on "partnership, not dominance, which our neighbor sometimes tries to exert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Szydlo-Nie-ugniemy-sie-pod-presja-3467377.html |title=Szydło: Nie ugniemy się pod presją |website=Bankier.pl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop [[Wieslaw Mering]] called Schulz's comments a "lost chance to stay quiet" (referring to infamous speech by French President [[Jacques Chirac]] telling Poland it "lost the chance to stay quiet" when expressing support for war against Iraq in 2003), "I know my country more than you do, I have lived in my homeland for 70 years, I can assure you that elections of the president and new government, are not evidence of a lack of democracy. Elections showed that our common citizens want change." Mering stated that the problem is in the fact that those who lost power are dissatisfied with the election result and are trying to use the [[European Parliament]] in their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,19439051,bp-mering-pisze-do-schulza-parlament-pod-pana-kierownictwem.html#ixzz3wqP0SpN2 |title=Wyborcza.pl |website=Wyborcza.pl |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to German calls for sanctions on Poland, Law and Justice MP [[Stanislaw Pieta]] responded, "The people who elected Hitler of their own free will, those who bowed before Stalin (...) want to instruct us", "who today cannot provide safety to their own people", "cannot deal with Islamic terrorism", "They want to give us lessons?

On 9 January 2016 Polish Minister of Justice [[Zbigniew Ziobro]] reacted to the proposal by German politician [[Günther Oettinger]] to sanction Poland in a letter criticising Oettinger for interfering in Polish internal affairs, while at the same time tolerating censorship over mass sexual attacks in Germany committed on New Year's Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75477,19451139,zbigniew-ziobro-w-liscie-otwartym-do-komisarza-guenthera-oettingera.html |title=Wyborcza.pl |website=Wyborcza.pl |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his reply to Frans Timmermans, Ziobro asked Timmermans "to exercise more restraint in instructing and cautioning the parliament and government of a sovereign and democratic state in the future, despite ideological differences that may exist between us, with you being of a left-wing persuasion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/world/europe/new-polish-government-faces-eu-investigation.html?_r=0 |title=New Polish Government Faces E.U. Investigation|publisher=NYT |date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pawel Kukiz]], the leader of the opposition party [[Kukiz'15]], the third largest party in Poland, stated in reaction to Martin Schulz, "You should pay more attention to democracy in your own country. Because if—God forbid—another Hitler were to appear in your country and lead with him those several million "immigrants" that you are planning, then I suspect the SS will look like the Salvation Army in comparison. I apologise for such a brutal statement, but the Nazis murdered my grandfather in Auschwitz, and I don't want their grandchildren to teach me lessons about democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/529062/Kukiz-nazisci-zamordowali-mi-Dziadka-w-Auschwitz-wiec-nie-zycze-sobie-by-ich-wnuki-uczyly-mnie-demokracji/Kukiz |title=Kukiz: naziści zamordowali mi Dziadka w Auschwitz więc nie życzę sobie, by ich wnuki uczyły mnie demokracji - WPROST |website=Wprost.pl |date=2016-01-09 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special meeting of all Polish parties represented in the Parliament was arranged by Prime Minister Szydlo on 12 January. The parliamentary leader of the Law and Justice Party, [[Ryszard Terlecki]], declared that the meeting would be dedicated to statements by German politicians that have caused outrage among the Polish public, and that he hopes that all other parties will share that sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/1568707,Beata-Szydlo-zwoluje-spotkanie-ws-polityki-zagranicznej |title=Beata Szydło zwołała na dziś spotkanie ws. polityki zagranicznej - Wiadomości |website=Polskieradio.pl |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore''''', 517 U.S. 559 (1996), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case limiting [[punitive damages]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|517|559|Text of the opinion on Findlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
The [[plaintiff]], Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new [[BMW]], and later discovered that the vehicle had been repainted before he bought it. [[Defendant]] BMW of North America revealed that their policy was to sell damaged cars as new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3% of the cost of the car. Dr. Gore sued, and an [[Alabama]] jury awarded $4,000 in compensatory damages (lost value of the car) and $4 million in [[punitive damages]], which was later reduced to $2 million by the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]. The punitive damages resulted not only from Dr. Gore's damages, but from BMW's egregious behavior across a broad spectrum of BMW purchasers over a multi-year period of time in which BMW repaired damaged vehicles and sold them as new to unsuspecting buyers as a matter of routine business operation.&lt;ref&gt;{L. Andrew Goggans, M.A.}[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-896.ZO.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision of the Alabama Supreme Court was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

==Issue==
Whether excessively high punitive damages violate the Due Process clause of the Constitution.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court, in an opinion by [[Justice Stevens]], found that the excessively high punitive damages in this case violate the Due Process clause. For punitive damages to stand, the damages must be reasonably necessary to vindicate the State's legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. Punitive damages may not be "grossly excessive" - if they are, then they violate substantive due process.

The Supreme Court applied three factors in making this determination:
# The degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct;
# the ratio to the compensatory damages awarded (actual or potential harm inflicted on the plaintiff); and
# Comparison of the punitive damages award and civil or criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct.

Using these factors, the Court found that BMW's conduct was not particularly reprehensible (no reckless disregard for health or safety, nor even evidence of bad faith). The ratio of actual or potential damages to punitive damages was suspiciously high. Finally, the criminal sanctions available for similar conduct were limited to $2,000, making the $2 million assessment the equivalent of a severe criminal penalty.

The Court noted, however, that these three factors can be over-ridden if it is "necessary to deter future conduct."

Dissenting opinions were written by [[Justice Scalia]] and [[Justice Ginsburg]] both contending that the Constitution was not implicated here, raising principles of federalism.

== Aftermath ==
On remand, the Supreme Court of Alabama ordered a new trial unless plaintiff accepted a remittitur of all but $50,000 of the punitive damages awarded.&lt;ref&gt;BMW, Inc. v. Gore, 701 So. 2d 507 (Ala. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The court reasoned that it may not have given sufficient weight to the degree of reprehensibility of BMW's conduct, and selected the $50,000 as in the range of other Alabama verdicts in cases of repaired cars being sold as new.

==Federalism questions==
In an academic article, following the arguments raised by the dissenting justices, Patrick Hubbard has questioned the appropriateness of federal courts reading substantive rights into the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] in order to preempt the role of state courts and legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;F. Patrick Hubbard, In Honor of Walter O. Weyrauch: Substantive Due Process Limits on Punitive Damages Awards: "Morals With Technique?", 60 Fla. L. Rev. 349, 352 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  These same people say the Court should not spend its time as a "super jury," second-guessing jury verdicts, but rather, "[T]he court should be more deferential to state courts and legislatures, and more concerned with developing a coherent framework."  &lt;ref&gt;F. Patrick Hubbard, In Honor of Walter O. Weyrauch: Substantive Due Process Limits on Punitive Damages Awards: "Morals With Technique?", 60 Fla. L. Rev. 349, 352 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3886">'''Brusseau v. Borelli''', {{law report|12|Cal. App. 4th|647}}, 16 Cal. Rptr. 2d 16, was a [[Superior Courts of California|California Superior Court]] Case from 1992 involving the enforcement of a [[contract]].

==Background==

Borelli was the wife to an ill and dying man. They had a [[prenuptial agreement]], but when the man fell into a worse state of sickness he agreed give more of his estate directly to his wife. After a stroke, he refused to be put in a hospital or special facility. His wife agreed to take care of him at home if he would agree to give her the title to certain [[real property]]. Shortly after, he died without making a change to his [[Will (law)|will]]. Brusseau, the executor of his will, refused to give Borelli the property she claimed. Borelli brought a legal suit against Brusseau and demanded that the court mandate him to bequeath the estate, but was ruled against. She subsequently appealed.&lt;ref name=Goog&gt;{{cite web

==Case==

The court considered if such a contract, one spouse helping another in time of illness in exchange for title to property, violated [[Marriage law|public law]].  The court determined that spouses have an automatic duty to care for each other in times of illness, without need of special contracts.  They believed that a spousal agreement that mandated such an arrangement would be contrary to public policy.  Borelli claimed that if it were not for the agreement she would have likely left him in his illness.&lt;ref name=Goog/&gt;&lt;ref name=Just/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

There was a minority dissenting opinion of the court that believed that spouses did not have such duty of care and should be allowed to enter into contracts as if they were not spouses.&lt;ref name=Goog/&gt;

==Decision==

The court ruled that the contract in question did violate public policy and was therefore unenforceable.  Brusseau was not compelled to transfer title of the property to Borelli.&lt;ref name=Goog/&gt;&lt;ref name=Just/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

==Importance==

Spouses cannot enter into similar contracts like so since, as spouses, they already have certain duties to each other.  Such contracts violate public law on marriage contracts.  In order for title of property to properly pass from one spouse to another in similar situations, it must be expressly written into a will or other document stating intent.&lt;ref name=Goog/&gt;&lt;ref name=Just/&gt;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

'''[[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]] Mellon''' was founded in 1996 as a [[joint venture]] between the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] (hereafter CIBC) and the [[Mellon Financial Corporation]] (now [[The Bank of New York Mellon]]) (hereafter Mellon) to offer asset servicing to institutional investors.  While commonly known as CIBC Mellon, the company comprises two sister companies, '''CIBC Mellon [[Trust company|Trust Company]]''' and '''CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Company''' (''Compagnie Trust CIBC Mellon'' and ''Société de services de titres mondiaux CIBC Mellon'' in French respectively).  Based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] CIBC Mellon offers asset servicing to corporate and institutional clients.

==History==

CIBC Mellon was founded in 1996 after CIBC joined with Mellon Financial Corporation in a 50-50 joint venture named CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services (CMGSS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/13/business/international-business-bank-venture-in-canada.html?sec=&amp;spon= New York Times, February 13, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, 1997, CIBC purchased a 50% stake in The R-M Trust Company from Mellon, which would become CMGSS's sister company, CIBC Mellon Trust Company (CMTC).&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 4, 1997, pp. C8; Mellon Sells Half of Unit&lt;/ref&gt;  CIBC Mellon acquired the Pension and Institutional Trust businesses from [[Canada Trust]] in 1997&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, May 8, 1997, pp. D7; Canada Trust Plans Sale&lt;/ref&gt; and the global custody business from the [[Bank of Montreal]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 18, 1999, pp. F1; Also in Business&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 CIBC Mellon acquired, from [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Financial Group]], their third party investment fund custody business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efinancialnews.com/homepage/content/570779/printerfriendly/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Corporate Trust Company===

In 1998 it seemed that CIBC Mellon would be acquiring the Pacific Corporate Trust Company of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].  That deal eventually fell through, and it was subsequently acquired by [[Computershare|Computershare Limited]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&amp;A/CIBC_Mellon_Global_Securities_acquires_Pacific_Corporate_Trust_Co-777320040 CIBC Mellon Global Securities acquires Pacific Corporate Trust Co]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133229494.html Computershare Acquires Pacific Corporate Trust Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Felcom Data Services acquisition===

On October 8, 2009, CIBC Mellon announced the acquisition of the unitholder recordkeeping and fund administration business of Felcom Data Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of [http://www.joviancapital.com Jovian Capital Corporation], for a purchase price of approximately C$4.2 million.  CIBC Mellon indicated that they would offer employment to the majority of employees involved in the business lines acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cibcmellon.com/Contents/en_CA/English/NewsRoom/BulletinsReleases/2009/PR20091008.html# |title=CIBC Mellon Press Release, October 8, 2009 |access-date=2009-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128223115/http://cibcmellon.com/Contents/en_CA/English/NewsRoom/BulletinsReleases/2009/PR20091008.html# |archive-date=2016-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of issuer services business to Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc.===

On November 1, 2010, CIBC Mellon sold its issuer services business (stock transfer and employee share purchase plans) to Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canstockta.com/CSTPressRelease.pdf Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc. Press Release, November 3, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

CIBC Mellon is a 50-50 [[joint venture]] between CIBC and BNY Mellon.  CIBC Mellon operates independently from both of its "owners".

While both CMTC and CMGSS physically occupy the same space, and in essence operate as one company, each has a separate [[board of directors]] which overlap the other.  The executive management team, however, has authority over both companies.

===Leadership team===

The current leadership team (as of 2018) comprises the following:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.cibcmellon.com/en/who-we-are/leadership/index.jsp&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Securities investigations==

CIBC Mellon has been the subject of two securities investigations.  The first, in 1998, involved the now defunct Pay Pop Inc.  The second, in 2004, involved the disclosure of custodial information to an outside source.

===Pay Pop Inc.===

In 1998, Alnoor Jiwan, a manager in CIBC Mellon's Vancouver office, was approached by Pay Pop Inc. and asked whether CIBC Mellon could issue Pay Pop Inc. shares without the required disclaimer which stated that the securities were not registered with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]].

It was alleged by the SEC, in the subsequent investigation, that Mr Jiwan knew that the securities were not registered, but agreed to act as the transfer agent (in order to issue the stock certificates) in return for 820,000 Pay Pop shares.  The SEC subsequently cited CIBC Mellon for acting as an unregistered broker and transfer agent, and for offering to sell unregistered securities in addition to alleging that the company was uncooperative in the investigation.

Alnoor Jiwan was subsequently terminated for cause from CIBC Mellon, following the company's discovery of the transactions, and simultaneously ceasing all dealings with Pay Pop Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, February 17, 2005, p.D.4&lt;/ref&gt;

CMTC agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of US$5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270.

CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the final judgment on March 2, 2005. Pursuant to the order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.&lt;ref name="TA1"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1277690/000127769011000002/xslFTAX01/primary_doc.xml TA1 dated January 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy breach===

In 2004, a long-term employee of CIBC Mellon was terminated, after it had been discovered that they had been disclosing institutional holdings in certain companies to unidentified parties in return for gifts.  It was reported that the employee had received hockey and baseball tickets as well as up to $100 in cash for tips on big investors who owned specific stocks.

The disclosures were discovered when a temporary worker received a request for data through an email.  The subsequent investigation, which included reviewing phone and email records, discovered that the employee had been disclosing information for years.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, December 9, 2004, p. C.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related party transactions with Enron===

In 2003, [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]] paid out $80 million in charges for complicity with [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce#Enron|its involvement]] with [[Enron]].  While the involvement was not related to CIBC Mellon, as CIBC is a majority stakeholder, it was required that it be reported on the TA-1 to the SEC.&lt;ref name="TA1" /&gt;

The '''Canada Evidence Act'''&lt;ref&gt;''Canada Evidence Act'', R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.&lt;/ref&gt; is an Act of the [[Parliament of Canada]], first passed in 1893, that regulates the rules of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] in court proceedings under federal law. As law of evidence is largely set by [[common law]], the Act is not comprehensive. 

The Act applies to court proceedings conducted under federal law. The Act thus applies in courts and administrative agencies created by the federal Parliament, such as the [[Federal Court of Canada]] and the [[Tax Court of Canada]], as well as appeals from those courts to the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] and the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].  The Act also applies in the provincial courts when they hear and determine matters under federal laws, notably under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]],&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46.&lt;/ref&gt; a federal statute.

The Act does not apply to matters under provincial law.  Each province has its own ''Evidence Act'' for matters under provincial law.  When a matter under provincial law is appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], the provincial ''Evidence Act'' governs, not the federal Act.  The ''Canada Evidence Act'' incorporates the provincial law of evidence to supplement the provisions of the federal Act, notably in the law relating to proof of service of documents.&lt;ref&gt;''Canada Evidence Act'', s. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4935}}) is a bill that would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] with respect to the [[child tax credit]]. The bill would require taxpayers claiming the child tax credit to provide their [[Social Security Numbers]], a change that would prevent undocumented immigrants from claiming the credit.&lt;ref name=MarcosPassesOverhaul&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes overhaul of child tax credit|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/213345-house-passes-overhaul-of-child-tax-credit|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would index the child credit to [[inflation]].&lt;ref name=JenkinsBlackOpEd&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Rep. Lynn|last2=Black|first2=Rep. Diane|title=Eliminating marriage penalty in family tax issues, simplifying education credits just makes good sense|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/eliminating-marriage-penalty-in-family-tax-issues-just-makes-good-sense/article/2551281|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Washington Examiner|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Background==
A study by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] found that it costs a middle-income family more than $241,000 to raise a child up to age 18.&lt;ref name="JenkinsBlackOpEd"/&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=4935sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4935 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4935|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014 would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]], with respect to the [[child tax credit]], to: (1) increase from $110,00 to $150,000 ($75,000 for individual taxpayers and married taxpayers filing separately) the threshold amount applicable to married couples fiing joint tax returns above which such tax credit is reduced, and (2) allow an inflation adjustment to the threshold amounts and the $1,000 credit amount beginning after 2014.&lt;ref name="4935sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on June 25, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4935&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4935|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45501|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 4935 would increase the amount of the child tax credit and the income thresholds at which the credit begins to phase out for taxpayers. Under current law, an individual may claim a tax credit of $1,000 for each qualifying child under the age of 17. H.R. 4935 would index the $1,000 amount for inflation starting in 2015. In addition, under current law the aggregate amount of child credits that may be claimed is phased out for married individuals filing joint tax returns with [[modified adjusted gross income]] over $110,000 and for unmarried individuals with such income over $75,000. H.R. 4935 would increase the beginning of the phaseout for joint filers to $150,000, and it would index for inflation the beginning points of the income phaseouts for all taxpayers starting in 2015. For married taxpayers filing separately, the beginning of the income phaseout would increase from $55,000 under current law to $75,000, indexed for inflation.&lt;ref name="cbo4935"/&gt;

The staff of the [[Joint Committee on Taxation]] (JCT) estimates that enacting H.R. 4935 would reduce revenues over the 2014-2024 period by about $93.9 billion, and increase direct spending by about $21.0 billion over that period. JCT therefore estimates that enacting the legislation would increase federal budget deficits by about $114.9 billion over the 2014-2024 period.&lt;ref name="cbo4935"/&gt;

The [[Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010]] establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending and revenues. Because enacting H.R. 4935 would affect revenues and direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures apply.&lt;ref name="cbo4935"/&gt;

JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]].&lt;ref name="cbo4935"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Child Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2014 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on June 23, 2014 by [[Lynn Jenkins|Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R, KS-2)]].&lt;ref name=4935allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4935 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4935/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]]. On July 17, 2014 the bill was reported (amended) alongside [https://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt527/CRPT-113hrpt527.pdf House Report 113-527].&lt;ref name="4935allactions"/&gt; The bill passed the House on July 25, 2014 in a vote of 237-173.&lt;ref name="MarcosPassesOverhaul"/&gt;

The White House threatened to veto the bill.&lt;ref name="MarcosPassesOverhaul"/&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Rep. [[Sam Johnson]] (R-TX) supported the bill. He said that "right now the IRS is providing this refundable child tax credit to those who are here illegally," arguing that "the last thing we need is to continue to encourage folks from Central America to make the dangerous and life threatening trek to Texas."&lt;ref name="MarcosPassesOverhaul"/&gt;

Rep. [[Jim McDermott]] (D-WA) opposed the bill, arguing that "this provision will harm millions of American kids who are in the United States living in immigrant families."&lt;ref name="MarcosPassesOverhaul"/&gt;

Rep. [[Rubén Hinojosa]] (D-TX) accused House Republicans of "attacks on the Latino community" with this bill as an example.&lt;ref name="MarcosPassesOverhaul"/&gt;

[[Elaine Maag]], writing in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', argued that Jenkins' "proposed expansions are ill-targeted and fail to address the credit's biggest looming issue: the change in refundability that will hit the poorest recipients after 2017."&lt;ref name=CSMonitorMaag&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maag|first1=Elaine|title=Child tax credit expansion has good intensions, but still far off from big issues|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Tax-VOX/2014/0630/Child-tax-credit-expansion-has-good-intentions-but-still-far-off-from-big-issues|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maag, the plan would be improved if the credit was made refundable for all families so that families so poor they had no tax liability could still benefit from the credit.&lt;ref name="CSMonitorMaag"/&gt;

==Facts==
In 1943, [[Learie Constantine]], a black [[Trinidad|Trinidadian]] professional cricketer for the [[West Indies]], travelled to [[London]] to play for the Dominions team against England at [[Lord's]]. He and his family had a reservation to stay at the [[Imperial Hotel, London]] in [[Russell Square]]; he had been assured that he and his family would be welcomed and treated with the utmost respect. When they arrived at the hotel however, they were informed they could stay only one night on account of complaints about their presence made by white [[United States|American]] military servicemen who were also staying at the hotel. According to a newspaper report, the receptionist said "we won't have niggers in this hotel" because the Americans were staying.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' (20 June 1944) 2, col 5&lt;/ref&gt;

They were treated as outcasts, and Constantine was outraged. He claimed the hotel was in breach of contract. In Britain there was no statute that expressly outlawed racial discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100greatblackbritons.com/bios/lord_leary_constantine.html|title=Lord Leary Constantine|work=100greatblackbritons.com|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Constantine claimed that the hotel committed a tort, deriving from the common law principle that innkeepers must not refuse accommodation to guests without [[just cause]].

==Judgment==
[[Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett|Mr Justice Birkett]] held that a [[legal right|right]] of Constantine had been violated. It was accepted that an innkeeper had a duty to provide reasonable accommodation and rejected the contention that when the hotel offered to lodge Constantine elsewhere, it was fulfilling that duty. Furthermore, even though Constantine suffered no pecuniary damage, the violation of the right was in principle capable of justifying a remedy. He was awarded the small sum of five guineas in damages.

{{Cquote|Before dealing with the main proposition of law advanced by Mr. Slade, I ought perhaps to deal with a further submission made by him: that, as Mr. Constantine went to the Bedford Hotel on the night in question, after leaving the Imperial Hotel, and was received and lodged there, the defendants were in the same position as though he had been received and lodged at the Imperial Hotel, and there had, therefore, been no refusal on which Mr. Constantine could rely. I reject this contention. Apart from the fact that the two hotels were in the same ownership, no further evidence was given as to the relationship between them, and the circumstances in which Mr. Constantine removed to the Bedford Hotel were such that it is impossible to find that the defendants did not refuse to receive and lodge Mr. Constantine. In ''[[Rothfield v. North British Railway Co.]]'', Lord Anderson said:&lt;ref&gt;1920 S.C. 805, 812.&lt;/ref&gt; "It was suggested that, as the pursuer might have obtained accommodation at another hotel in Edinburgh, he was not entitled to insist on obtaining it at the defenders' hotel, I do not agree. A traveller is, in my opinion, entitled to choose the hotel at which he desires to be a guest, and the defenders are not entitled to put a traveller, desiring to use their hotel, to the trouble and expense of finding another hotel." In ''[[Fell v. Knight]]'',&lt;ref&gt;8 M. &amp; W. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that an innkeeper was only bound to provide reasonable accommodation, and the defendants through Mr. Slade said that, by offering accommodation at the Bedford Hotel, they had fulfilled their duty. I cannot accept this view. The claim before me is that the defendants refused to receive and lodge Mr. Constantine at the Imperial Hotel, and I hold it to be no answer that Mr. Constantine went to the Bedford Hotel under protest.

The first and main submission of the defendants was that the present action is an [[action on the case]], that the gist of an action on the case is the damage actually suffered and proved, and here no damage was suffered and no special damage is either alleged or proved. The [[Statute of Westminster 1285|Statute of Westminster]], 2, 1285, authorizing the writ "in consimili casu" produced the writs which were classified under the common denomination "writs of trespass on the case," and the actions on the case based on them included - certainly from very early times - the present form of action before me. This action was based on the common law and on what was termed the custom of the realm. The distinction between the writ of trespass and the writ of trespass on the case would appear to be that trespass was the appropriate remedy for the direct invasion of a right by force either actual or implied by law, and case was the remedy for a wrong in which one at least of those elements was lacking. In an ordinary trespass, in which a forcible act directly caused damage to the plaintiff's person or property, the connexion between the act and the damage was usually obvious, and the damage was presumed, but in case the damage arising from the wrongful act was the gist of the action. Indeed, it has been said by the late Sir William Holdsworth that the constant need to inquire whether the damage complained of was the proximate consequence of the act of the defendant familiarized the courts with the comparatively modern conception of the idea of [[negligence]] in law, but, although it was the general rule that damage was the gist of an action on the case and although without question the action before me is an action on the case, it is said by Sir [[Patrick Hastings]] that that rule is by no means an inflexible rule and that in certain cases, of which he says this is one, damage will be presumed and that Mr. Constantine can recover.

It is to be observed that ''[[White's case]]'';&lt;ref&gt;(1558) 2 Dyer 158, b.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fell v. Knight]]''; and ''[[Hawthorn v. Hammond]]'';&lt;ref&gt;1 Car. &amp; Kir. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; were all actions on the case, and, incidentally, an indictment may be brought, as in ''[[Reg. v. Sprague]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1899) 63 J. P. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; which was brought so recently as 1891 at Surrey quarter sessions and shows that an innkeeper could be indicted, and, indeed, in that case was indicted, for not receiving a guest who was attired in what in those days was called rational dress. The great and celebrated case of ''[[Ashby v White]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2 Ld. Raym. 938; 3 Ld. Raym. 320; Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.), vol. I, 253; Howell's State Trials, vol. XIV, 695.&lt;/ref&gt; it must always be remembered, was itself an action on the case, and I observed in reading the very interesting argument in Howell's State Trials, vol. 14, that the Mr. Slade of that day used the very language that the Mr. Slade of this day used before me - that the action would not lie inasmuch as it was an action on the case, that damage was the gist of the action, and that no damage had been proved or could be presumed.

Reference was also made to the action for [[defamation]], which is, of course, an [[action on the case]], but in libel damage need not be proved. It is presumed. The action for slander is an action on the case. In certain specified cases, however, damage need not be proved, but is presumed. These matters go very far back into the [[history of law]]. In the beginning of the sixteenth century the common law courts began to take from the ecclesiastical courts most of the suits for defamation. The common law remedy was an action on the case and damage was undoubtedly the gist of the action, but the [[Court of Star Chamber]] regarded defamation as a crime, and, when the Court of Star Chamber was abolished, the law of defamation included these two separate and divergent parts derived from the common law and from the Court of Star Chamber. In slander, too, by the middle of the seventeenth century the categories that we know today so well, in which words are actionable per se had been established, the imputation of a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment, the imputation of a contagious disease, or the imputation of unfitness for carrying on a trade or profession. The first of these categories arose from an attempt to distinguish the spheres of jurisdiction of the common law courts and the ecclesiastical courts: the others, most probably, on the obvious tendency of the imputation itself to cause damage. In libel, after the Restoration, the courts held that libel was a wrongful act from which damage could be presumed, but in slander no extension of the settled categories is permitted to this day. In ''[[Jones v. Jones]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1916] 2 A. C. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Wrenbury, in his speech in the House of Lords, said:&lt;ref&gt;[1916] 2 A. C. 506&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fact that the imputation is a gross and grievous attack upon personal character is not of itself enough. For otherwise a statute would not have been necessary to enable a woman or a girl to sue for slander upon her chastity. The imputation must be such and the state of facts such, not as that a judge would necessarily or reasonably presume or infer damage, but as that judges in the past have presumed or inferred damage. This involves a confession which I fear must be made, that the law of slander rests not upon any principle whose elasticity will admit new cases, but upon artificial distinctions. An artificial and arbitrary rule is not a principle. The plaintiff must for success bring his case within the very limited class of cases in which slander has been held actionable. He must show that the imputation is such and the state of facts is such as that a presumption of damage as matter of law has been made in the past under like circumstances. I am of course here speaking, and throughout this opinion I am speaking, of cases in which damage is not proved."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For a most exhaustive discussion of the artificial law of slander Viscount Haldane's speech in that case may be referred to.&lt;ref&gt;[1916] 2 A.C. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact, therefore, that libel is an action on the case and yet damage is to be presumed is based on the historical development of the law of defamation, as is the highly artificial position of the law of slander, and it affords me little help in the question which I have to decide today.

Reference was also made in the course of the argument, both by Mr. Slade and by Sir Patrick Hastings, to the action for [[malicious prosecution]]. It was the development of the action on the case, founded on the statutory writ of [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]], which gave rise to the tort of malicious prosecution. Holt C.J., defines the law in ''[[Savile v. Roberts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(1698) 1 Ld. Raym. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be noted that, among other things, he laid down that the plaintiff must prove one of three kinds of damage: (1.) damage to his fair fame; (2.) damage to his person; (3.) damage to his property. The ground of the action was not conspiracy, but the damage, and as a rule no action will lie for bringing a civil action maliciously, but the bringing of a prosecution maliciously may give rise to an action on the case if special damage is proved. In ''[[Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co. v. Eyre]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1883) 11 Q. B. D. 674, 689&lt;/ref&gt; Bowen L.J., said: "The reason why, to my mind, the bringing of an action under our present rules of procedure and under our present law, even if it is brought without reasonable or probable cause and with malice, gives rise to no ground of complaint appears to me easily to be seen upon referring to the doctrine laid down by Holt C.J., in ''[[Savile v. Roberts]]''." Then he refers to the three matters which I have mentioned as to the kinds of damage. Bowen L.J., continued: "It is clear that Holt C.J., considered one of those three heads of damage necessary to support an action for malicious prosecution. To apply this test to any action that can be conceived under our present mode of procedure and under our present law, it seems to me that no mere bringing of an action, although it is brought maliciously and without reasonable or probable cause, will give rise to an action for malicious prosecution." In a passage which I have had continually before me in considering this case he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Although every judge of the present day will be swift to do [[justice]] and slow to allow himself as to matters of justice to be encumbered with either precedents or technicalities, still every wise judge who sits to administer justice must feel the greatest respect for the [[wisdom]] of the past, and the wisdom of the past presents us with no decisive authority for the broad proposition in its entirety which the counsel for the plaintiff company have put forward. But although an action does not give rise to an action for malicious prosecution, inasmuch as it does not necessarily or naturally involve damage, there are legal proceedings which do necessarily and naturally involve that damage; and when proceedings of that kind have been taken falsely and maliciously, and without reasonable or probable cause, then, inasmuch as an injury has been done, the law gives a remedy. Such proceedings are indictments - I do not say every indictment, but I mean all indictments involving either scandal to reputation or the possible loss of liberty to the person, that is, all ordinary indictments for ordinary offences. In its very nature the presentation or the prosecution of an indictment involves damage, which cannot be afterwards repaired by the failure of the proceedings, to the fair fame of the person assailed, and for that reason, as it seems to me, the law considers that to present and prosecute an indictment falsely and without reasonable or probable cause is a foundation for a subsequent action for a malicious prosecution."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mr. Slade further relied on the decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper, Ld]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1919] A. C. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; clearly an authority of very great importance. It dealt with most interesting questions about the tort of [[Champerty and maintenance|maintenance]]. In the middle ages the offence of maintenance was treated, as was defamation and conspiracy, both as a crime and as a tort, but in modem times it came to be regarded as a tort rather than a crime. In defamation and conspiracy the civil action was an action on the case in which damage was the gist of the action, but in maintenance it appears to have been "doubtful whether the action was not an action in the nature of trespass, in which nominal damages could be recovered." In ''[[Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper, Ld]]'', two very closely connected questions were decided. The first was whether an action for maintenance would lie in the absence of proof of special damage, which is mutatis mutandis the question which I have to decide in the present case, and the second question, closely allied, was whether the success of the maintained litigation was a bar to the action. The decision of the majority of the House of Lords - Lord Finlay L.C., Lord Shaw and Lord Phillimore - was that the action would not lie in the absence of proof of special damage, and Mr. Slade pressed that decision on me in this case. Viscount Haldane and Lord Atkinson dissented, and Sir Patrick Hastings said that, although I was bound by the majority decision if this were a matter of maintenance, the principles enunciated by the dissentient lords were applicable to the facts before me. The dissentient lords thought that, as maintenance was admittedly illegal, the law should give a remedy in tort for nominal damages as in the case of trespass and libel since, as Lord Atkinson said, "the mere invasion of the plaintiff's legal right imports damage and is sufficient to maintain the action." If conduct be illegal, or, indeed, criminal, it does not necessarily follow that an action in tort for nominal damages will lie. If the action for maintenance is not to be regarded as an action on the case analogous to trespass, no doubt an action would lie for nominal damages, but the majority of the House of Lords treated the action as an action on the case and applied the general rule in that case. On the second question the majority of the House of Lords - Lord Finlay L.C., and Viscount Haldane, and Lord Atkinson - held that the success of the maintained litigation was not a bar to the right of action for maintenance. This is, if one may say so with the very deepest respect, in apparent conflict with the decision on the first question, for, if the maintained litigation was just and succeeded and is not a bar to the action, the plaintiff could scarcely claim anything but nominal damages, and, according to the answer to the first question, the action for nominal damages will not lie. There is a passage in the speech of Lord Finlay which I think is of importance in the present case. He said: "The action for maintenance is, in my opinion, one which can be sustained only if special damage has been occasioned to the plaintiff by the maintenance. The maintenance may be punishable as an offence, but to give a right of action the commission of the offence must have caused damage to the plaintiff. Of course, if a right has been infringed, as in ''[[Ashby v. White]]'', where a man was deprived of his right to vote, no proof of damage is necessary. As Lord Holt expressed it, 'an injury imports a damage, when a man is thereby hindred of his right'." Lord Finlay, speaking of damages, said: "As there was no damage in the present case, I am of opinion that the action for maintenance must fail and that judgment must therefore be entered for the defendants on this head of claim. I think it would be futile to send the case down for a new trial, even if it were regarded as one in which for the maintenance of the action proof of damage is not necessary. We have all the facts before us and it is clear that, even on this view, only nominal damages could be recovered. Any verdict giving substantial damages on these facts would be perverse and would be set aside. If then the action for maintenance were to be regarded as one for the invasion of a right, to sustain which special damage is not necessary, the proper course would be to give judgment for the plaintiff for nominal damages. But, in my opinion, this head of claim fails altogether." I need not cite other than a passage from the dissentient judgment of Viscount Haldane which shows quite clearly that what he was there doing was to say that in the action for maintenance the proper principle to be applied was the principle which is enunciated by Holt C.J., in ''[[Ashby v. White]]''. He said: "As Lord Holt showed in ''Ashby v. White'', every violation of a right imports damage in contemplation of law. This principle applies whether the right arises out of a contract, as in ''[[Marzetti v. Williams]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1830) 1 B. and Ad. 415.&lt;/ref&gt; or out of a tort, as in ''[[Embrey v. Owen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;6 Ex. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; The damage may be substantial, but may also amount to what is merely nominal." A little later, after quoting Parke B., he said: "But where the right is, as it often is, an absolute right the doctrine laid down by Lord Holt in ''Ashby v. White'' applies, and every infringement of such an absolute right gives a claim to nominal damages, even though all actual loss or injury is disproved." At the end of his opinion Viscount Haldane said: "Under these circumstances I think he was entitled to no more than nominal damages for the violation of his right, and that the jury ought to have been directed to this effect. I think that justice will be done if judgment on the claim for maintenance is entered for him for merely nominal damages, unless the jury on a new trial think that exemplary damages should be given. No direction suggesting such damages should be given." It is clear, therefore, on that case that the real point to be decided was with what class of case the House of Lords was dealing, the majority saying that it was an action founded on case, in which special damage is essential, and Viscount Haldane and Lord Atkinson saying that it was a claim which was akin to the action in ''Ashby v. White''.

The case before me is admittedly in the form of an action on the case, but Sir Patrick Hastings' main contention was that this was a case in which the law will presume damage, and that the decision in ''Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper, Ld.'' does not affect the matter. He relied very strongly on ''Ashby v. White'' which is reported very fully in Howell's State Trials, where the contentions before the court are very clearly set out and discussed. In that case Holt C.J. said: "The single question in this case is, whether, if a free burgess of a corporation, who has an undoubted right to give his vote in the election of a burgess to serve in Parliament, be refused and hindered to give it by the officer, an action on the case will lie against such officer? I am of opinion that judgment ought to be given in this case for the plaintiff." Later comes the famous passage on which Sir Patrick Hastings relied and which was the passage cited by the dissentient lords in ''Neville v. London "Express" Newspaper, Ld.'' Holt C.J. said: "If the plaintiff has a right, he must of necessity have a means to vindicate and maintain it, and a remedy if he is injured in the exercise or enjoyment of it; and, indeed, it is a vain thing to imagine a right without a remedy; for want of right and want of remedy are reciprocal." .... "And I am of opinion that this action on the case is a proper action. My brother Powell indeed thinks that an action upon the case is not maintainable, because there is no hurt or damage to the plaintiff; but surely every injury imports a damage, though it does not cost the party one farthing, and it is impossible to prove the contrary; for a damage is not merely [[pecuniary]], but an injury imports a damage, when a man is thereby hindred of his right."

Is the principle of that case to be applied to the facts of the present matter? In ''Embrey v. Owen'', Parke B. said: "It was very ably argued before us by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs had a right to the full flow of the water in its natural course and abundance, as an incident to their property in the land through which it flowed; and that any abstraction of the water, however inconsiderable, by another riparian proprietor, and though productive of no actual damage, would be actionable, because it was an injury to a right and, if continued, would be the foundation of a claim of adverse right in that proprietor. We by no means dispute the truth of this proposition, with respect to every description of right. Actual perceptible damage is not indispensable as the foundation of an action; it is sufficient to show the violation of a right, in which case the law will presume damage; injuria sine damno is actionable, as was laid down in the case of ''Ashby v. White'' by Lord Holt, and in many subsequent cases, which are all referred to, and the truth of the proposition powerfully enforced in a very able judgment of the late Story J. in ''Webb v. Portland Manufacturing Co.''&lt;ref&gt;55. (1838) 3 Sumner Rep. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case cited, Story J. said: "But I am not able to understand how it can correctly be said, in a legal sense, that an action will not lie, even in the case of a wrong or violation of a right, unless it is followed by some perceptible damage which can be established as a matter of fact; in other words, that ''injuria sine damno'' is not actionable. On the contrary, from my earliest reading, I have considered it laid up among the very elements of the common law that, wherever there is a wrong, there is a remedy to redress it; that every injury imports damage in the nature of it; and, if no other damage is established, the party injured is entitled to a verdict for nominal damages."

The last case to which I need refer is ''[[Rothfield v. North British Railway Co.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;1920 S. C. 805.&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Rothfield brought a claim against the railway company for refusing to allow him to stay at their hotel, the North British Station Hotel, at Edinburgh. Lord Anderson, on the hearing of the case, awarded him on the first hearing one guinea damages. There were further matters, but, finally, it was decided by the full court that the defendants were entitled to refuse to receive Mr. Rothfield in their hotel. From the report it appears that: "On November 8, 1918, the Lord Ordinary (Lord Anderson), after a hearing in the Procedure Roll, being of opinion that he could decide the case without any inquiry into the facts, found and declared in terms of the declaratory conclusions of the summons, and found the pursuer entitled to damages, which he assessed at the sum of one guinea." The form of the action there was (a) for a declaration, and (b) for damages, and the damages that were claimed were stated to be "for payment by the defenders of the sum of 105l. in the name of damages." The judgment of Lord Anderson is most exhaustive and instructive on both the English and the Scots law. The matter came a second time before the Lord Ordinary when he affirmed his previous decision. Then the Lord Justice Clerk said: "He therefore" - the pursuer - "raised the present action to have his rights declared," and later: "The origin and development of this branch of the law have been different in England and Scotland. In England it is apparently based on the 'custom of England,' and has been the subject of many judicial determinations. In Scotland it had its origin in statutory provisions in the fifteenth century, and has received little elucidation by judicial utterances, so far as the question raised in the present case is concerned." Again: "But, if I may take the judgment of Lord Alverstone in ''[[Browne v. Brandt]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1902] 1 K. B. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; as correctly stating the law of England, there does not seem to be much, if any, difference in the result between the laws of England and of Scotland on this subject." I cite passages from this case because they may be helpful as showing what other minds felt on similar facts. The Lord Justice Clerk also said: "Further, if members of the public have rights as to accommodation in an hotel, .... which I think they have, and if the keeper of an hotel is subject to the liabilities before referred to, then I am inclined to think that an action of declarator" - which is similar to our action for a declaration - "may be competently brought by a traveller, who desires to establish the existence of these rights and liabilities, against an hotel keeper who refuses to recognise them, when the traveller legitimately and properly asks that they should be recognised and accorded to him, or, in the appropriate circumstances, puts forward his claim to have these rights declared. I am further inclined to be of opinion that the denial of such rights and liabilities, when legitimately and properly required to be recognised and observed by an individual traveller, would justify an appropriate action of declarator and damages, though the damages awarded might, of course, be merely nominal. I am not satisfied that a declaratory conclusion is an essential preliminary to a conclusion for damages in such an action." Lord Dundas said: "The pursuer concludes for 105l. in name of damages. A claim of that nature must, I think, be supported by averment and proof of some actual legal wrong sustained by the pursuer, for which the defenders are responsible." Then he discussed whether there was in fact any legal wrong and concluded: "A general denial of the pursuer's statement of his alleged rights does not, in my judgment, constitute the infliction of a legal wrong sounding in damages." Lord Salvesen said: "There is, therefore, no evidence upon which we are entitled judicially to proceed of the pursuer having suffered any legal wrong from which a claim of damages, however nominal, might emerge." Lord Ormidale said: "In this action the pursuer seeks to recover damages. He avers that he made application as a traveller for, and was refused, admission to the defenders' hotel, and so suffered a legal wrong. In my opinion, he may be held on one occasion to have made such an application and to have been refused." He went on to deal with the facts and added: "Accordingly, it seems to me that the pursuer did - apart from the question whether the defenders had good ground for refusing him - on this occasion suffer a legal wrong sounding in damages."

With the greatest desire loyally to follow authority which is binding on me, I find that I have yet to decide the express point in this case without any express authority to guide me. Having given the matter the fullest consideration, I hold this action by Mr. Constantine to be maintainable without proof of special damage. His right, I think, is founded on the common law. That right I found was violated. The law affords him a remedy, and the injury which he has suffered imports damage. I think that the principles of the decision in ''[[Ashby v. White]]'' apply to this case. It only remains for me to say that I was urged by Sir Patrick Hastings to award exemplary or substantial damages, because of the circumstances in which the denial of the right took place when Mr. Constantine suffered, as I find that he did suffer, much unjustifiable humiliation and distress, but on the authorities I do not feel that I can accede to that submission, having regard to the exact nature of this action and the form in which it comes before me. My conclusion is that I must give judgment for Mr. Constantine for nominal damages only, and I, therefore, award him the sum of five guineas.}}

==Significance==
The ruling did not end the colour bar in some British hotels and other public establishments. Constantine later wrote ''Colour Bar'' (1954). The book dealt with racial prejudice in Britain. In 1947, Constantine was appointed as a Member of the [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Order of the British Empire]]. The [[Hotel Proprietors Act 1956]] extended the law against discrimination in statute to all hotels, also those offering food and drink. But it was not until after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] in the USA that the Labour Party committed to a general statute against [[racial discrimination]] with the passage of the [[Race Relations Act 1965]]. This was further extended to all public services and employment by the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]. The law is now found in the [[Equality Act 2010]]. 

Cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] drew one of his more famous cartoons attacking the hotel's treatment of Learie Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoons.ac.uk/record/LSE3344 |title=Imperial welcome |work=cartoons.ac.uk |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes''', also known as the '''Water Convention''', is an [[List of international environmental agreements|international environmental agreement]] and one of five [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|UNECE's]] negotiated environmental [[Treaty|treaties]].
The purpose of this Convention is to improve national attempts and measures for protection and management of transboundary surface waters and groundwaters. On the international level, Parties are obliged to cooperate and create joint bodies. The Convention includes provisions on: monitoring, research, development, consultations, warning and alarm systems, mutual assistance and access as well as exchange of information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water.html Water Convention]. UNECE.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was opened for signature in Helsinki on 17 March 1992 and entered into force on 6 October 1996. As of September 2018, it has been ratified by 43 parties, which includes 42 states and the [[European Union]]. It has been signed but not ratified by the United Kingdom.

== About the Convention ==

Some of the UNECE's water related problems are of water quantity and water quality, high [[water stress]] and [[overexploitation]] of water resources, increasing droughts and floods, contaminated water resulting in water-related diseases, etc. These issues are even harder to solve due to transboundary nature of watersources UNECE region. More than 150 major rivers and 50 large lakes are either shared or are situated along the borders of two or more countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/text/text.html Introduction]. UNECE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Water Convention approaches its issues in a [[Holism|holistic]] way, equally emphasizing the importance of [[ecosystem]]s, human societies and economies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/water/pdf/watercon.pdf|publisher=UNECE|accessdate=24 June 2012|quote=existence and threats of adverse effects, in the short or long term, of changes in the conditions of transboundary watercourses and international lakes on the environment, economies and well-being of the member countries of the Economic Commission for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stressing the integrated water management instead the previously used focus on specific localized problems.

In 2003, the Water Convention was [[Amendments|amended]], allowing countries outside the UNECE region to join the Convention, and thus benefit from its legal framework and experience; the amendment entered into force in 2013. This is especially beneficial for countries bordering UNECE region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/documents/2004/wat/ece.mp.wat.14.e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of international agreements concerning transboundary waters ===

UNECE's records on transboundary water agreements previous to the Water Convention: 
* in 1858 Austria and Bavaria signed the agreement concerning the regulation and management of the [[Inn (river)|river Inn]]
* in 1863 Belgium and the Netherlands signed the treaty concerning the regulation of water supply from the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]]
* in 1890 Germany and Switzerland signed the agreement concerning the hydropower station at [[Rheinfelden]]
* from 1909 dates the first and still existing agreement covering both water-quality and water-quantity issues, and setting up a joint body, between Great Britain and the United States of America relating to boundary waters between Canada and the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/partnership/part621.html Implementation].

== Implementation ==
At their second meeting the State Parties decided to help countries in establishing joint bodies, as required by certain provisions of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/water/pdf/watercon.pdf|publisher=UNECE|accessdate=24 June 2012|page=2|quote="Joint body" means any bilateral or multilateral commission or other appropriate institutional arrangements for cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it was decided to facilitate cooperation between this and other UNECE conventions, and to examine difficulties arising when implementing the Convention (administrative practices).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/partnership/part.html Implementation]. UNECE (12 November 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
At the fifth session of the meeting of the parties, a Guide to implementing the Convention was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/documents/2009/Wat/MOP5/ECE.MP.WAT.2009.L.2_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A Guide offers commentaries to the provisions, and examples of good practices. In addition to that, an Assessment was made, to show the current status of transboundary waters. The Second Assessment covers more than 140 transboundary rivers, 25 transboundary lakes, about 200 transboundary groundwaters and 25 [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar sites]] or other [[wetland]]s of transboundary importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/publications/pub/second_assessment.html Second Assessment of Transboundary Rivers, Lakes and Groundwaters].

== Convention Bodies ==

=== Meeting of the Parties ===

Meeting of the Partis is the main governing body of the Water Convention that reviews its implementation. It consist of all Parties to the Convention. Other Signatories and States as well as [[non-governmental]] and [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] organizations can participate as observers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/meetings/convention_meeting.html Meeting of the Parties]. UNECE (30 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bureau ===

The Bureau of the Meeting of the Parties makes arrangements to further develop the workplan, adapts it to changing circumstances and avoids duplication of efforts with water-related activities of other United Nations bodies and other international organizations. Is also takes initiatives to strengthen implementation of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/convention_bureau.html Bureau]. UNECE (30 November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsidiary Bodies to the Meeting of the Parties ===

The two Working Groups collaborate closely through cooperation on a number of joint activities. They hold one ordinary meeting per year.

1. '''Working Group on [[Integrated Water Resources Management]]'''
The focus of this Group are the intersectoral activities related to the integrated management of transboundary water resources. Activities tend to prevent damage to the environment, promote the ecosystem approach in the framework of integrated water resources management, and ensure conservation and possibly, restoration of water-related ecosystems. Further efforts include promotion of the concept of [[Payment for ecosystem services|payments for ecosystem services]], prevention of accidental [[water pollution]], and [[adaptation to climate change]] in the transboundary context, including floods and droughts management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/meetings/documents_wgiwrm.html Working Group on Integrated Water Resources Management]. UNECE.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. '''Working Group on Monitoring and Assessment'''
The focus is establishing and implementing joint programmes for monitoring the conditions of transboundary waters, including floods and [[ice drift]], as well as transboundary impacts. Also, this Working Group prepares periodic assessments on the status of transboundary waters and international lakes in the UNECE region. It encourages Parties to inform each other and the general public about any critical situation that may have a transboundary impact and to make available the results of water and effluent sampling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/environmental-policy/treaties/water/about-the-convention/envwaterconvention-bodies/envwatermeetingsdocuments-wgma.html Working Group on Monitoring and Assessment]. UNECE.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal Board ===

The Legal Board was established in November 2003, to facilitate legal issues related to the work under the Convention. The Legal Board has developed the Guide to Implementing the Convention, together with the Working Group on Integrated Water Resources.

=== Task Force on Water and Climate ===

The Task Force is responsible for activities related to adaptation to climate change, including flood and drought management. In 2007–2009 they prepared a Guidance on Water and Adaptation to Climate Change&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/water/publications/documents/Guidance_water_climate.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which provides recommendations for the governments. The Task Force implements the Guidance through various pilot projects and a platform for exchanging experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/water_and_climate.html Task Force on Water and Climate]. UNECE.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joint Ad Hoc Expert Group on Water and Industrial Accidents  ===

This Group deals with prevention of the accidental pollution of transboundary waters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/env/teia/adhocgroup.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Water Assessment Center ===

The Centre was established at the second meeting of the Parties (Paris, March 2000). It serves as an operational body of the Convention and its Provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/water/services/serv_1.html International Water Assessment Center]. UNECE (7 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation Committee ===

The objective of the Implementation Committee is to facilitate, promote and safeguard the implementation and application and compliance with the Water Convention. Established in November 2012, the committee is to be simple, non-confrontational, non-adversarial, transparent, supportive and cooperative, building on the collaborative spirit of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/env/water/implementation_committee.html. UNECE (28 May 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protocols to the Convention ==
There are two protocols to this Convention:

=== Protocol on Water and Health ===
This protocol was negotiated in 1999. It is addressing the problems of water related diseases in the UNECE region, where one out of seven people do not have access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. Consequently, that brings diseases such as  [[cholera]], [[bacillary dysentery]], coli infections, viral [[hepatitis A]] and [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/env/water/text/text_protocol.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
The implementation of this Protocol requires setting firm targets: he process of setting targets consists of analyzing the national situation, streamlining and harmonizing responsibilities and commitments in water and health. A State Party has to elaborate a realistic plan for improvement. This process helps focus the attention on the services and actions needed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/env/water/implementation.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the areas of work of the Protocol are: small scale water supplies, water supply and sanitation in extreme weather events, water-related disease surveillance, equitable access to water and sanitation etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/environmental-policy/treaties/water/protocol-on-water-and-health/areas-of-work-of-the-protocol.html Areas of work of the Protocol]. UNECE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol on Water and Health entered into force in 2005. As of 2013, it has been ratified by 26 European states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-5-a&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en Ratifications (Protocol on Water and Health)].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protocol on Civil Liability ===
The [[Protocol on Civil Liability for Damage and Compensation for Damage Caused by Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary Waters]] was formally adapted at the Ministerial Conference "Environment for Europe" in Kiev, Ukraine, on 21 May 2003. It was initiated by a first joint special session of the Parties to the Water Convention together with the Parties to the [[Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents]]. Its aim is to give individuals affected by the transboundary impact of industrial accidents on international watercourses (e.g. fishermen or operators of downstream waterworks) a legal claim for adequate and prompt compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/civil-liability/welcome.html Civil Liability – Home]. UNECE.&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial limits of liability as well as the minimum amount of financial securities have been agreed by all the actors of the negotiation, including the insurance sector, and are therefore realistic and appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/env/civil-liability/welcome Civil Liability – Home]. UNECE.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the Protocol has been ratified only by [[Hungary]] and is not in force.

[[Image:Group of Deck Prisms.jpg|thumb|250px|Group of original deck prisms]]

For centuries, [[sailing ship]]s used deck prisms to provide a safe source of natural [[sunlight]] to illuminate areas below [[deck (ship)|deck]]s.  Before [[electricity]], light below a vessel's deck was provided by [[candle]]s, [[oil lamp|oil]] and [[kerosene lamp]]s—all dangerous aboard a wooden ship. The deck prism was a clever solution: laid flush into the deck, the glass prism refracted and dispersed natural light into the space below from a small deck opening without weakening the planks or becoming a [[fire hazard]].

In normal usage, the prism hangs below the overhead and disperses the light sideways; the top is flat and installed flush with the deck, becoming part of the deck. A plain flat glass window would just form a single bright spot below—not very useful for general illumination—hence the prismatic shape.

To maximize light output, the glass used was originally made colorless with the addition of manganese dioxide; the purple hue of some specimens is caused by decades of exposure to [[ultraviolet|UV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solarization of glass|url=http://libanswers.cmog.org/a.php?qid=283712|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboard [[collier (ship type)|collier]]s (coal ships), prisms were also used to keep check on the cargo hold: light from a fire would be collected by the prism and be made visible on the deck even in daylight.

The names "deck light", "dead light" or "deadlight" are sometimes used, though the latter is uncommon as a reference to prisms, as more often refers to non-opening plain-glass panels. Deadlights were commonplace for lighting underground vaults in the 19th century, in which application they were also called "[[pavement light]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kay|first1=Thornton|title=Pavement lights, basement lighting, and illuminating vault covers|url=http://www.salvonews.com/uk/pavement-lights-basement-lighting-and-illuminating-vault-covers-x86494x9.html|accessdate=12 January 2017|work=SalvoNEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt; (UK) or "vault lights"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/19/realestate/streetscapes-subway-platforms-letting-the-sun-shine-in.html Streetscapes/Subway Platforms; Letting the Sun Shine In] By CHRISTOPHER GRAY, New York Times, May 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; (US).

When used in conjunction with an [[electronic signature]], it can provide evidence whether data received has been tampered with after being signed by its original sender. In a time where fraud and [[identity theft]] has become rampant, electronic authentication can be a more secure method of verifying that a person is who they say they are when performing transactions online.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balbas|first1=Luis|title=Digital Authentication - Factors, Mechanisms and Schemes|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/digital-authentication-factors-mechanisms-schemes|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various e-authentication methods that can be used to authenticate a user's identify ranging from a password to higher levels of security that utilize [[multifactor authentication]] (MFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMahon|first1=Mary|title=What is E-Authentication?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-e-authentication.htm|website=wiseGEEK|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of security used, the user might need to prove his or her identity through the use of [[security token]]s, challenge questions or being in possession of a certificate from a third-party certificate authority that attests to their identity.&lt;ref name="Turner-AuthenticationBasics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Digital Authentication - the Basics|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/digital-authentication-the-basics|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Digital enrollment and authentication reference process.jpg|thumb|Digital enrollment and authentication reference process by the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] The American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has developed a generic electronic authentication model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=William|last2=Dodson|first2=Donna|last3=Newton|first3=Elaine|title=Electronic Authentication Guideline|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63-1/SP-800-63-1.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides a basic framework on how the authentication process is accomplished regardless of jurisdiction or geographic region. According to this model, the enrollment process begins with an individual applying to a [[Credential Service Provider]] (CSP). The CSP will need to prove the applicant's identity before proceeding with the transaction. Once the applicant's identity has been confirmed by the CSP, he or she receives the status of "subscriber", is given an authenticator, such as a token and a credential, which may be in the form of a username.

The CSP is responsible for managing the credential along with the subscriber's enrollment data for the life of the credential. The subscriber will be tasked with maintaining the authenticators. An example of this is when a user normally uses a specific computer to do their online banking. If he or she attempts to access their bank account from another computer, the authenticator will not be present. In order to gain access, the subscriber would need to verify their identity to the CSP, which might be in the form of answering a challenge question successfully before being given access.&lt;ref name="Turner-AuthenticationBasics" /&gt;

==History==
The need for authentication has been prevalent throughout history. In ancient times, people would identify each other through eye contact and physical appearance. The [[Sumer]]ians in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] attested to the authenticity of their writings by using seals embellished with identifying symbols. As time moved on, the most common way to provide authentication would be the handwritten signature.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Authentication factors==
There are three generally accepted factors that are used to establish a digital identity for electronic authentication, including:
* Knowledge factor, which is something that the user knows, such as a password, answers to challenge questions, ID numbers or a PIN.
* Possession factor, which is something that the user has, such as mobile phone, PC or token
* [[Biometric]] factor, which is something that the user is, such as his or her fingerprints, eye scan or voice pattern
Out of the three factors, the biometric factor is the most convenient and convincing to prove an individual's identity. However, having to rely on this sole factor can be expensive to sustain. Although having their own unique weaknesses, by combining two or more factors allows for reliable authentication. It is always recommended to use multifactor authentication for that reason.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Methods==
Authentication systems are often categorized by the number of factors that they incorporate. The three factors often considered as the cornerstone of authentication are:
Something you know (for example, a password)
Something you have (for example, an ID badge or a cryptographic key)
Something you are (for example, a voice print, thumb print or other biometric)

Multifactor authentication is generally more secure than single-factor authentication. But, some multi-factor authentication approaches are still vulnerable to cases like man-in-the-middle attacks and Trojan attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|title=The Failure of Two-Factor Authentication|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/03/the_failure_of.html|website=Schneier on Security|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common methods used in authentication systems are summarized below.

=== Token ===
[[File:SecureID token new.JPG|thumb|A sample of token]]
Tokens generically are something the claimant possesses and controls that may be used to authenticate the claimant's identity. In e-authentication, the claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network. Therefore, a token used for e-authentication is a secret and the token must be protected. The token may, for example, be a cryptographic key, that is protected by encrypting it under a password. An impostor must steal the encrypted key and learn the password to use the token.

=== Passwords and PIN-based authentication===
Passwords and PINs are categorized as "something you know" method. A combination of numbers, symbols, and mixed cases are considered to be stronger than all-letter password. Also, the adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) features during the information transmission process will as well create an encrypted channel for data exchange and to further protect information delivered. Currently, most security attacks target on password-based authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Passwords and PINs based Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/passwords.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=2 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015717/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/passwords.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public-key authentication===
This type of authentication has two parts. One is a public key, the other is a private key. A public key is issued by a Certification Authority and is available to any user or server.  A private key is known by the user only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Public-Key Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/pkey.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015722/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/pkey.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetric-key authentication===
The user shares a unique key with an authentication server. When the user sends a randomly generated message (the challenge) encrypted by the secret key to the authentication server, if the message can be matched by the server using its shared secret key, the user is authenticated.
When implemented together with the password authentication, this method also provides a possible solution for two-factor authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Symmetric-key Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/skey.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709050327/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/skey.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SMS-based authentication===
[[File:US-VISIT (CBP).jpg|thumb|Biometric authentication]]
The user receives password by reading the message in the cell phone, and types back the password to complete the authentication. [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) is very effective when cell phones are commonly adopted. SMS is also suitable against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, since the use of SMS does not involve the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=SMS based Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/sms.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827103712/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/sms.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biometric authentication ===
Biometric authentication is the use of unique physical attributes and body measurements as the intermediate for better identification and access control. Physical characteristics that are often used for authentication include fingerprints, voice recognition, face, recognition, and iris scans because all of these are unique to every individual separately. Traditionally, Biometric Authentication based on token-based identification systems, such as passport, and nowadays becomes one of the most secure identification systems to user protections. A new technological innovation which provides a wide variety of either behavioral or physical characteristics which are defining the proper concept of Biometric Authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Biometric Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/biometric.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108205213/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/biometric.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital identity authentication ===
Digital identity authentication refers to the combined use of device, behavior, location and other data, including email address, account and credit card information, to authenticate online users in real time.

==Electronic credentials==
Paper credentials are documents that attest to the identity or other attributes of an individual or entity called the subject of the credentials. Some common paper credentials include passports, [[birth certificate]]s, driver's licenses, and employee identity cards. The credentials themselves are authenticated in a variety of ways: traditionally perhaps by a signature or a seal, special papers and inks, high quality engraving, and today by more complex mechanisms, such as holograms, that make the credentials recognizable and difficult to copy or forge. In some cases, simple possession of the credentials is sufficient to establish that the physical holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. More commonly, the credentials contain biometric information such as the subject's description, a picture of the subject or the handwritten signature of the subject that can be used to authenticate that the holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. When these paper credentials are presented in-person, authentication [[biometrics]] contained in those credentials can be checked to confirm that the physical holder of the credential is the subject.

Electronic identity credentials bind a name and perhaps other attributes to a token. There are a variety of [[Electronic identification|electronic credential]] types in use today, and new types of credentials are constantly being created (eID, [[Voter ID laws|electronic voter ID card]], biometric passports, bank cards, etc.) At a minimum, credentials include identifying information that permits recovery of the records of the registration associated with the credentials and a name that is associated with the subscriber.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Verifiers==
In any authenticated on-line transaction, the verifier is the party that verifies that the claimant has possession and control of the token that verifies his or her identity. A claimant authenticates his or her identity to a verifier by the use of a token and an authentication protocol. This is called Proof of Possession (PoP). Many PoP protocols are designed so that a verifier, with no knowledge of the token before the authentication protocol run, learns nothing about the token from the run. The verifier and CSP may be the same entity, the verifier and [[relying party]] may be the same entity or they may all three be separate entities. It is undesirable for verifiers to learn shared secrets unless they are a part of the same entity as the CSP that registered the tokens. Where the verifier and the relying party are separate entities, the verifier must convey the result of the authentication protocol to the relying party. The object created by the verifier to convey this result is called an assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=William|last2=Dodson|first2=Donna|last3=Polk|first3=W|title=INFORMATION SECURITY|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1_0_2.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authentication schemes==
There are four types of authentication schemes: local authentication, centralized authentication, global centralized authentication, global authentication and web application (portal).

When using a local authentication scheme, the application retains the data that pertains to the user's credentials. This information is not usually shared with other applications. The onus is on the user to maintain and remember the types and number of credentials that are associated with the service in which they need to access. This is a high risk scheme because of the possibility that the storage area for passwords might become compromised.

Using the central authentication scheme allows for each user to use the same credentials to access various services. Each application is different and must be designed with interfaces and the ability to interact with a central system to successfully provide authentication for the user. This allows the user to access important information and be able to access private keys that will allow he or she to electronically sign documents.

Using a third party through a global centralized authentication scheme allows the user direct access to authentication services. This then allows the user to access the particular services they need.

The most secure scheme is the global centralized authentication and web application (portal). It is ideal for E-Government use because it allows a wide range of services. It uses a single authentication mechanism involving a minimum of two factors to allow access to required services and the ability to sign documents.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Authentication and digital signing working together==
Often, authentication and digital signing are applied in conjunction. In [[advanced electronic signature]]s, the signatory has authenticated and uniquely linked to a signature. In the case of a [[qualified electronic signature]] as defined in the [[eIDAS]]-regulation, the signer's identity is even certified by a qualified [[trust service provider]]. This linking of signature and authentication firstly supports the probative value of the signature – commonly referred to as [[non-repudiation]] of origin. The protection of the message on the network-level is called non-repudiation of emission. The authenticated sender and the message content are linked to each other. If a 3rd party tries to change the message content, the signature loses validity.&lt;ref name="Turner-NonRep"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Understanding Non-Repudiation of Origin and Non-Repudiation of Emission|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-non-repudiation-of-origin-and-non-repudiation-of-emission|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics biometric authentication==

=== Homogenization and decoupling ===
Biometric authentication can be defined by many different procedures and sensors which are being used to produce security. Biometric can be separated into physical or behavioral security. Physical protection is based on identification through fingerprint, face, hand, iris, etc. On the other hand, behavioral safety is succeeded by keystroke, signature, and voice.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c3e6/b094d8052137c6e91f9c89cba860d356483a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The main point is that all of these different procedures and mechanism that exist, produce the same homogeneous result, namely the security of the system and users. When thinking of the decoupling of hardware, the hardware is not coded in the same form by digitization which directly makes decoupling more difficult. Because of unlinkability and irreversibility of biometric templates, this technology can secure user authentication.

=== Digital traces ===
Biometric authentication has a substantial impact on digital traces. For example when the user decides to use his fingerprint to protect his data on his smartphone, then the system memorizes the input so it will be able to be re-used again. During this procedure and many other similar applications proves that the digital trace is vital and exist on biometric authentication.

=== Connectivity ===
Another characteristic of biometric authentication is that it combines different components such as security tokens with computer systems to protect the user. Another example is the connection between devices, such as camera and computer systems to scan the user’s retina and produce new ways of security. So biometric authentication could be defined by connectivity as long it connects different applications or components and through these users are getting connected and can work under the same roof and especially on a safe environment on the cyber world.

=== Reprogrammable &amp; smart ===
As new kinds of cybercrime are appearing, the ways of authentication must be able to adapt. This adaptation means that it is always ready for evolution and updating, and so it will be able to protect the users at any time. At first biometric authentication started in the sampler form of user’s access and defining user profiles and policies. Over time the need of biometric authentication became more complex, so cybersecurity organizations started reprogramming their products/technology from simple personal user’s access to allow interoperability of identities across multiple solutions. Through this evolution, business value also rises.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.fidis-project.eu/fileadmin/journal/issues/1-2007/Biometric_Implementations_and_the_Implications_for_Security_and_Privacy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk assessment ==
When developing electronic systems, there are some industry standards requiring United States agencies to ensure the transactions provide an appropriate level of assurance. Generally, servers adopt the US' [[Office of Management and Budget]]'s (OMB's) E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies (M-04-04) as a guideline, which is published to help federal agencies provide secure electronic services that protect individual privacy. It asks agencies to check whether their transactions require e-authentication, and determine a proper level of assurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Authentication Risk Assessment for Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ecomm/e_rx/risk_assessment_dea_218.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It established four levels of assurance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radack |first1=Shirley |title=ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION:  GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING SECURE TECHNIQUES |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011249/http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assurance Level 1: Little or no confidence in the asserted identity's validity.&lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 2: Some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. &lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 3: High confidence in the asserted identity's validity. &lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 4: Very high confidence in the asserted identity's validity.

=== Determining assurance levels ===
The OMB proposes a five-step process to determine the appropriate assurance level for their applications:
* Conduct a risk assessment, which measures possible negative impacts. 
* Compare with the five assurance levels and decide which one suits this case.
* Select technology according to the technical guidance issued by NIST.
* Confirm the selected authentication process satisfies requirements.
* Reassess the system regularly and adjust it with changes.&lt;ref name="OMB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolten|first1=Joshua|title=Memorandum: E-Authentication Guideline for Federal Agencies|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf|publisher=Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The required level of authentication assurance are assessed through the factors below:
* Inconvenience, distress, or damage to standing or reputation;
* Financial loss or agency liability;
* Harm to agency programs or public interests;
* Unauthorized release of sensitive information;
* Personal safety; and/or civil or criminal violations.&lt;ref name="OMB" /&gt;

=== Determining technical requirements ===
[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) guidance defines technical requirements for each of the four levels of assurance in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radack |first1=Shirley |title=ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION:  GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING SECURE TECHNIQUES |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011249/http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tokens are used for proving identity. Passwords and symmetric cryptographic keys are private information that the verifier needs to protect. Asymmetric cryptographic keys have a private key (which only the subscriber knows) and a related public key.
* Identity proofing, registration, and the delivery of credentials that bind an identity to a token. This process can involve a far distance operation.
* Credentials, tokens, and authentication protocols can also be combined together to identify that a claimant is in fact the claimed subscriber. 
* An assertion mechanism that involves either a digital signature of the claimant or is acquired directly by a trusted third party through a secure authentication protocol.

==Guidelines and regulations==
Triggered by the growth of new cloud solutions and online transactions, person-to-machine and machine-to-machine identities play a significant role in identifying individuals and accessing information. According to the Office of Management and Budget in the U.S, more than $70 million was spent on identity management solutions in both 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Shawn|title=E-authentication: What IT managers will be focusing on over the next 18 months|url=https://gcn.com/articles/2013/07/31/eauthentication.aspx|website=GCN|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments use e-authentication systems to offer services and reduce time people traveling to a government office. Services ranging from applying for visas to renewing driver's licenses can all be achieved in a more efficient and flexible way. Infrastructure to support e-authentication is regarded as an important component in successful e-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agimo.gov.au/infrastructure/authentication|title=Whole of Government Information and Communications Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor coordination and poor technical design might be major barriers to electronic authentication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=27391 Breaking Barriers to eGovernment (Draft Deliverable 1b)], eGovernment unit, European Commission, August 2006. See table 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In several countries there has been established nationwide common e-authentication schemes to ease the reuse of digital identities in different electronic services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanpkiforum.jp/shiryou/e-auth_policy/overview_e-auth_v07.pdf An overview of International Initiatives in the field of Electronic Authentication], Japan PKI Forum, June 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other policy initiatives have included the creation of frameworks for electronic authentication, in order to establish common levels of trust and possibly interoperability between different authentication schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/security-and-authentication/ Australia], [http://e-com.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ecic-ceac.nsf/en/h_gv00090e.html Canada], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf US] (M04-04).&lt;/ref&gt;

===US===
E-authentication is a centerpiece of the [[United States government]]'s effort to expand electronic government, or [[e-government]], as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier to access. The e-authentication service enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) from other web sites that both the user and the government  trust.

E-authentication is a government-wide partnership that is supported by the agencies that comprise the Federal CIO Council. The United States General Services Administration (GSA) is the lead agency partner. E-authentication works through an association with a trusted credential issuer, making it necessary for the user to log into the issuer's site to obtain the authentication credentials.  Those credentials or e-authentication ID are then transferred the supporting government web site causing authentication.The system was created in response a December 16, 2003  memorandum was issued through the  Office of Management and Budget.  Memorandum M04-04 Whitehouse.&lt;ref name="OMB" /&gt; That memorandum updates the guidance issued in the  ''Paperwork Elimination Act'' of 1998, 44 U.S.C. § 3504 and implements section 203 of the E-Government Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 36.

NIST provides guidelines for digital authentication standards and does away with most knowledge-based authentication methods. A stricter standard has been drafted on more complicated passwords that at least 8 characters long or passphrases that are at least 64 characters long.&lt;ref name="NIST800-63-3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft NIST Special Publication 800-63-3: Digital Authentication Guideline|url=https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In [[Europe]], [[eIDAS]] provides guidelines to be used for electronic authentication in regards to electronic signatures and certificate services for website authentication. Once confirmed by the issuing Member State, other participating States are required to accept the user's electronic signature as valid for cross border transactions.

Under eIDAS, electronic identification refers to a material/immaterial unit that contains personal identification data to be used for authentication for an online service. Authentication is referred to as an electronic process that allows for the electronic identification of a natural or legal person. A trust service is an electronic service that is used to create, verify and validate electronic signatures, in addition to creating, verifying and validating certificates for website authentication.

Article 8 of eIDAS allows for the authentication mechanism that is used by a natural or legal person to use electronic identification methods in confirming their identity to a relying party. Annex IV provides requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication.&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
E-authentication is a centerpiece of the Russia government's effort to expand e-government, as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier for the Russian people to access. The e-authentication service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garant.ru/products/ipo/prime/doc/12092469/|title=Постановление Правительства РФ от 28 ноября 2011 г. N 977 "О федеральной государственной информационной системе "Единая система идентификации и аутентификации в инфраструктуре, обеспечивающей информационно-технологическое взаимодействие информационных систем, используемых для предоставления государственных и муниципальных услуг в электронной форме"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) they already have from web sites that they and the government trust.

== Other applications ==
Apart from government services, e-authentication is also widely used in other technology and industries. These new applications combine the features of authorizing identities in traditional database and new technology to provide a more secure and diverse use of e-authentication. Some examples are described below.

=== Mobile authentication ===
Mobile authentication is the verification of a user's identity through the use a mobile device. It can be treated as an independent field or it can also be applied with other multifactor authentication schemes in the e-authentication field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Margaret|first1=Rouse|title=mobile authentication definition|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/mobile-authentication|website=SearchSecurity.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For mobile authentication, there are five levels of application sensitivity from Level 0 to Level 4. Level 0 is for public use over a mobile device and requires no identity authentications, while level 4 has the most multi-procedures to identify users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of India Department of Electronics and Information Technology Ministry of Communications and Information Technology|title=e-Pramaan: Framework for e-Authentication|url=https://epramaan.gov.in/documents/ePramaan_Framework.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For either level, mobile authentication is relatively easy to process. Firstly, users send a one-time password (OTP) through offline channels. Then, a server identifies the information and makes adjustment in the database. Since only the user has the access to a PIN code and can send information through their mobile devices, there is a low risk of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tolentino|first1=Jamie|title=How to Increase App Security Through Mobile Phone Authentication|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/03/16/increasing-application-security-with-mobile-phone-authentication/|accessdate=3 November 2015|publisher=TNW news|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-commerce authentication ===
In the early 1980s, [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) systems was implemented, which was considered as an early representative of E-commerce. But ensuring its security is not a significant issue since the systems are all constructed around closed networks. However, more recently, business-to-consumer transactions have transformed. Remote transacting parties have forced the implementation of E-commerce authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Matthew|title=Identity Authentication and 'E-Commerce'|journal=Warwick, Journal of Information Law &amp;Technology|date=23 Feb 2005|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/1998_3/ford/#a2|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the approaches adopted in E-commerce authentication are basically the same as e-authentication. The difference is E-commerce authentication is a more narrow field that focuses on the transactions between customers and suppliers. A simple example of E-commerce authentication includes a client communicating with a merchant server via the Internet. The merchant server usually utilizes a web server to accept client requests, a database management system to manage data and a payment gateway to provide online payment services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawma|first1=Victor|title=A New Methodology for Deriving Effective Countermeasures Design Models|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.1216&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
To keep up with the evolution of services in the digital world, there is continued need for security mechanisms. While passwords will continued to be used, it is important to rely on authentication mechanisms, most importantly multifactor authentication. As the usage of e-signatures continues to significantly expand throughout the United States, the EU and throughout the world, there is expectation that regulations such as [[eIDAS]] will eventually be amended to reflect changing conditions along with regulations in the United States.&lt;ref name="Walker-Perspectives"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Heather|title=How eIDAS affects the USA|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/how-eidas-affects-the-us|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fire test''' is a means of determining whether [[fire protection]] products meet minimum performance criteria as set out in a [[building code]] or other applicable legislation. Successful tests in laboratories holding national accreditation for testing and certification result in the issuance of a [[certification listing]]. The listing is public domain, whereas the test report itself is proprietary information belonging to the test sponsor.

There are many different types of fire tests apart from those on firestops. Walls and floors themselves can be tested, closures within them, such as windows, [[fire door]]s, fire dampers, [[structural steel]], and more. Fire tests are conducted both on [[active fire protection]] and on [[passive fire protection]] items. Each have different test methods and scales. There are full-scale, small-scale and bench-scale tests. There are tests on [[system]]s, such as the one below, but there are also tests on materials, such as [[intumescent]]s, to be sure of components that may be used within a system.

Fire testing must consider all applicable provisions of the intended [[product certification]]. It is also prudent to test products in such a manner as to ensure ease of use and broad, economical applications with regards to [[listing and approval use and compliance]].

== Examples of fire testing for products and systems ==
* ASTM E84 Standard Test Method for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials, also known as the [[Steiner tunnel test]]
* ASTM E1354 Standard Test Method for Heat and Visible Smoke Release Rates for Materials and Products Using an [[cone calorimeter|Oxygen Consumption Calorimeter]]
* ASTM E1354 Standard Test Method for Determining Flammability Characteristics of Plastics and Other Solid Materials Using [[Microscale Combustion Calorimetry]]
* ASTM D2863 Standard Test Method for Measuring the [[Limiting oxygen index|Minimum Oxygen Concentration to Support Candle-Like Combustion of Plastics (Oxygen Index)]]
* DIN 4102 Part 1 Fire behaviour of building materials and building components – Part 1: Building materials; concepts, requirements and tests
* [[UL 94|UL 94 Standard for Tests for Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances]]
* UL 2221 Tests of Fire Resistive Grease Duct Enclosure Assemblies
* UL 1479 Fire Tests of Through-Penetration Firestops
* UL 1709 Rapid Rise Fire Tests of Protection Materials for Structural Steel
* UL 2085 Protected Aboveground Tanks for Flammable and Combustible Liquids
* [[EN 16034]] Pedestrian doorsets, industrial, commercial, garage doors and openable windows – Product standard, performance characteristics – Fire resisting and/or smoke control characteristics
* FAR 25.853 [a-1] &amp; ASTM E 906 Standard Test Method for Heat and Visible Smoke Release Rates for Materials and Products, also known as the [[OSU Rate of Heat Release Apparatus|OSU Test]]

== Ad hoc fire testing ==
A fire test can also mean an [[Ad hoc testing|ad hoc test]] performed to gather information in order to understand a specific hazard, such as a construction or storage configuration. Tests can be bench scale (e.g., flammable liquid flash point), medium scale (e.g., storage commodity classification), or full scale (e.g., replication of an entire rack storage configuration).&lt;ref&gt;''NFPA 13 Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems'' 2007 Edition, Annex C ''Explanation of Test Data and Procedures for Rack Storage''&lt;/ref&gt; Typical information gathered from full-scale testing is heat release rate vs. time, smoke production and species composition, radiant heat, and interaction with fire control or suppression systems.

== Fire test examples ==

Many fire tests are run by official laboratories for the purpose of product certification. However, some manufacturers of fire protection products also maintain their own facilities and run tests for [[Research and development|R &amp; D]] purposes before going to the expense and exposure of a test at a third party facility.

Some universities have functioning fire research groups which are equipped to run fire tests on building materials.

The below photos illustrate types of furnace testing as seen in the United States.

The use of inadequate fire testing and lack of [[product certification]] on [[circuit integrity]] [[fireproofing]] of electrical wiring between [[nuclear reactor]]s and control rooms in [[nuclear power plant]]s led to the [[Thermo-Lag scandal]], which became known as a result of disclosures by [[Gerald W. Brown]] to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], watchdog groups, and the press.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8314">'''General Alliance against Racism and for Respect for French and Christian Identity''' ({{lang-fr|Alliance générale contre le racisme et pour le respect de l'identité française et chrétienne}}, '''AGRIF''') is a French organization tied to the far right and Catholic [[integrism]] that fights against speech it considers to violate French hate speech laws by being hateful towards Christians or the French people. Recognized as an [[anti racism]] organization by the French court system, the organization has brought several cases before court and won a few cases in the [[Court of Cassation]] in the 1990s, but has had little legal success more recently.

== Background ==
A change to the [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881]] in 1972 outlawed [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred#France|hate speech]]  and gave anti-racist organizations the right to bring charges in such cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), p.55&lt;/ref&gt; The provision, known as [[René Pleven|Loi Pleven]],  was generally understood to protect vulnerable minorities and all cases brought before the Court of Cassation (France) before 1993 involving minorities, but the law was written in race neutral language.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Following electoral successes for [[Jean Marie Le Pen]] and [[Front National]] (FN), AGRIF was started by a member of the European Parliament for FN, [[Bernard Antony]], in 1984 to fight against what the organization referred to as anti-French and anti-Christian racism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), p.71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg (2017) ''[https://books.google.no/books?id=_j5YDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg Far-Right Politics in Europe]'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Antony was a leader for the [[traditionalist Catholicism|traditionalist Catholic]] and [[Integrism|integrist]] fraction of FN.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Frey (2014) ''[https://books.google.no/books?id=U6H8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA212 Nationalism and the Cinema in France: Political Mythologies and Film Events]'' p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davies (1999) ''[https://books.google.no/books?id=SEorBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29 The National Front in France: Ideology, Discourse and Power]'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; He later left the party and ran unsuccessfully for [[Party of France]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt; Frédérique Schneider (21 September 2017) [https://www.la-croix.com/France/Politique/Sept-dates-marque-Front-national-2017-09-21-1200878680 Sept dates qui ont marqué le Front national] ''[[La Croix]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After a legal waiting period after establishment of five years, AGRIF brought a case for recognition as an anti-racism organization for court in 1989. A tribunal court in Paris initially refused to accept the organization's legal standing as it didn't consider it a legitimate anti-racism organization, but this decision was overturned by the appellate court of Paris and in 1991 the [[Court of Cassation]] recognized AGRIF as having legal standing as an anti-racism organization, stressing the neutral language of the hate speech regulation that the court found did not exclude non-majority groups like French people and Christians from being possible subjects of punishable racism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), pp.71&amp;ndash;72&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court cases ==
AGRIF sued writer [[Marek Halter]] and the ''[[Le Figaro]]'' for defamation against Catholics for an assertion in the newspaper by Halter that the Catholic churches in Eastern Europe were "archaic, xenophobic, often racist and anti-semitic."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), pp.72&amp;ndash;73 (alternatively, as a single article, pp. 20&amp;ndash;21)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dinstein/&gt; The appellate court of Paris acquitted Halter and ''Le Figaro'' on the basis that the statement only referred to some Catholic churches at a certain place and time and did not refer to Catholicism itself. The case came for the Court of Cassation in 1993. AGRIF referred to a 1991 Court of Cassation decision where the court had found that accusations that American Jews exploited Holocaust for their own interest constituted hate speech against Jews even if the statement only referred to a sub-group of Jews, and argued that this also meant that statements that only targeted part of the Catholic community could constitute hate speech. The Court of Cassation, citing both its 1991 decision on AGRIF and its 1991 decision on American Jews, ruled that Halter's statement about the Eastern Churches targeted Christians in Eastern Europe in a way that violated the hate speech provision. After a retrial at the appelate court of Orleans where Halter and Le Figaro were found guilty of defamation of Catholics, the Court of Cassation upheld the conviction in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), pp.72&amp;ndash;73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dinstein&gt; Yoram Dinstein [https://books.google.no/books?id=nFuStivk_NYC&amp;pg=PA408 ''Israel Yearbook on Human Rights'': 1995] p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, AGRIF also got the support of the Court of Cassation in three other cases of alleged anti-Catholic hate speech, including one case against [[Charlie Hebdo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; 

After that time however, the Court of Cassation would mostly rule against AGRIF. Legal experts attribute this to a legal reform that made it easier to appeal decision to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) which more strongly tended to rule in favor of free speech,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), pp.74&amp;ndash;75&lt;/ref&gt; and did not typically interpret hate speech law to protect majority groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bleich|Bleich]] (2018), p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2006 Giniewski v. France case, the ECHR in a chamber judgement ruled that a civil case decision by the  Orléans Court of Appeal upheld by the Court of Cassation where Paul Giniewski had been obligated to pay one Franc to AGRIF as damage for implying [[Veritatis splendor]] could be linked to the Holocaust violated [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Press Release 31 January 206 [https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&amp;id=961699&amp;Site=COE&amp;direct=true CHAMBER JUDGMENT - GINIEWSKI v. FRANCE] Council of Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization lost a case in a tribunal court in Avignon against [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Collection Lambert]] where AGRIF had demanded that Lambert removed a print version of the photograph ''[[Piss Christ]]'' as well as an internet version. AGRIF was instead ordered to pay Lambert 8000 euros for filing a prejudiced lawsuit. The poster had been vandalized by unknown persons before the case was decided.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/art/piss-christ-la-justice-deboute-une-association-catholique_985125.html Piss Christ: la justice déboute une association catholique] ''[[L'Express|L´Express]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Pineau et al (18 April 2011) [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-art/vandalism-and-threats-greet-piss-christ-in-france-idUSTRE73H4JR20110418 Vandalism and threats greet "Piss Christ" in France] Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016,  a Paris tribunal court acquitted [[Femen]] on accusations of causing harm against Christians after they interrupted a demonstration against same-sex marriage with slogans saying "Fuck Church" among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.la-croix.com/Urbi-et-Orbi/Actualite/France/L-Agrif-perd-proces-contre-Femen-2016-02-17-1200740757 L’Agrif perd son procès contre les Femen] ''Le Croix''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LadiesNOLAButlerProclamation.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cartoon from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 12 July 1862]]

'''General Order No. 28''' was a military decree made by [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] during the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Truslow Adams|Adams, James Truslow]], ''Dictionary of American History'', New York: [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Battle of New Orleans (Civil War)|Battle of New Orleans]], Butler established himself as military commander of that city on May 1, 1862. Many of the city's inhabitants were strongly hostile to the Federal government, and many women in particular expressed this contempt by insulting [[Union Army|Union]] troops.

Accordingly, on May 15, Butler issued an order to the effect that any woman insulting or showing contempt for any officer or soldier of the [[United States]] should be "treated as a woman of the town plying her [[avocation]]" -  meaning [[Solicitation|soliciting]] of [[prostitution]]. The order had no sexual connotation; rather, it permitted soldiers to not treat women performing such acts as ladies. If a woman punched a soldier, for example, he could punch her back.&lt;ref name="jones20120518"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/the-beast-in-the-big-easy/ | title=The Beast in the Big Easy | work=The New York Times | date=2012-05-18 | accessdate=May 19, 2012 | author=Jones, Terry L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the "Woman's Order," it nonetheless was very controversial at home and abroad, as women throughout New Orleans interpreted it as Butler legalizing [[rape]]. The general dislike over No. 28 even went so far as people printing his portrait on the bottom of [[chamber pots]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/1862/july/new-orleans-cartoon.htm Harper's Weekly Cartoon (July 12, 1862)]&lt;/ref&gt; and was a cause of Butler's removal from command of New Orleans on December 16, 1862.

==Text of the Order==

{{Quotation|'''HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF'''

:New Orleans, May 15, 1862.

::As the officers and soldiers of the United States have been subject to repeated insults from the women (calling themselves ladies) of New Orleans in return for the most scrupulous non-interference and courtesy on our part, it is ordered that hereafter when any female shall by word, gesture, or movement insult or show contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States she shall be regarded and held liable to be treated as a woman of the town plying her avocation.

:By command of Major-General Butler:

:'''GEO. C. STRONG''',
:Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarhome.com/butlerorder.htm General Orders, No. 28 (Butler's Woman Order)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Records of the American Civil War]]-- SERIES I--VOLUME XV [S# 21]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Women in the Confederacy==

With many men away from home fighting for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], women sacrificed "physical conveniences and comforts…for what was considered a holy cause" by becoming the front lines of war morale. They inspired troops and kept up morale by retaining "an uncritical faith in the soldiers and a mystical faith in Providence" which they expressed through letters to soldiers and personal diaries.&lt;ref name=Simkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Simkins|first=Francis Butler|title=The Women of the Confederacy|date=1936|publisher=Garrett &amp; Massey, Incorporated|location=Richmond|isbn=0403012120|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add to their burden, women had to figure out how to support themselves without men to provide for them. Many women "leaped from their spheres" to assume duties and roles that were almost always performed by men. Women became managers of farms or plantations or sought employment outside of the home in order to provide for themselves and their families.&lt;ref name=Massey&gt;{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Mary Elizabeth|title=Women in the Civil War|date=1966|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=9780803282131|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This plight was observed through not only personal correspondence and diaries, but through demonstrations known as bread riots. The [[Richmond Bread Riot]] occurred on April 2, 1863. Women were distressed due to the food shortages, the failure of relief efforts, and the general struggle of independence in a world based on paternalism and benevolence. The women of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] raided stores on Cary Street and Main Street, only interrupted by Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]], who allowed them to keep the goods they stole from the stores.&lt;ref name="Simkinsp127"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simkins|first=Francis Butler|title=The Women of the Confederacy|date=1936|publisher=Garrett &amp; Massey, Incorporated|location=Richmond|isbn=0403012120|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
By the end of the war, Confederate women had made sacrifices that were compared to the "stern resolution and self-abnegation of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Sparta|Lacedaemon]]." They willingly deprived themselves of things such as food and clothing in order to help the suffering troops.&lt;ref name=Faust&gt;{{cite book|last=Faust|first=Drew Gilpin|title=Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War|date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195080346|page=190|editor=Catherine Clinton|chapter=Altars of Sacrifice: Confederate Women and the Narratives of War}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, [[Augusta Jane Evans]] published a novel titled ''Macaria; or, Alters of Sacrifice'' in which she writes of a woman who discovered her usefulness in the Confederate cause, likening her to the woman "who sacrificed herself on the altar of the gods in order to save Athens time of war." To many white Confederate women, the Confederacy was their Athens, for which they would sacrifice all.&lt;ref name=Faustp188&gt;{{cite book|last=Faust|first=Drew Gilpin|title=Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War|date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195080346|page=188|editor=Catherine Clinton|chapter=Altars of Sacrifice: Confederate Women and the Narratives of War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extreme sacrifice made by white Confederate women is one of the tenets of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] memory of the Civil War. Women are to be revered for their sacrifices and identified for their important roles in a society dominated by paternalism and the patriarchal power structure.&lt;ref name=Gulley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gulley|first=H.E.|title=Women and the Lost Cause: preserving a Confederate identity in the American Deep South|journal=Journal of Historical Geography|date=1993|volume=19|issue=2|page=125|doi=10.1006/jhge.1993.1009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union Control of New Orleans==

Major General Benjamin F. Butler occupied the city of New Orleans on May 1, 1862. The residents of New Orleans, especially the women, did not take Butler's appointment as military general very well. Butler's troops faced "all manner of verbal and physically symbolic insults" from women, including obvious physical avoidance such as crossing the street or leaving a street car to avoid a Union soldier, being spat upon, and having chamber pots being dumped upon them.&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Alecia P.|title=Occupied Women: Gender, Military Occupation, and the American Civil War|date=2009|publisher=Louisiana State University|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=9780807137178|page=28|editor=LeeAnn Whites|chapter=(Mis)Remembering General Order No.28: Benjamin Butler, the Woman Order, and Historical Memory}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Federal troops were offended by this treatment, and after two weeks of occupation, Gen. Butler had had enough. He issued his General Order No. 28, which instructed Union soldiers to treat any woman who offended a soldier "as a woman of the town plying her avocation."

The order was highly publicized and heavily criticized both domestically and overseas. Butler became known as "The Beast."&lt;ref name=Hearn&gt;{{cite book|last=Hearn|first=Chester G.|title=When the Devil Came Down to Dixie: Ben Butler in New Orleans|date=1997|publisher=Louisiana State University|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=9780807121801|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British House of Lords]] called it a "most heinous proclamation" and regarded it as "one of the grossest, most brutal, and must unmanly insults to every woman in New Orleans." The [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Earl of Carnarvon]] proclaimed the imprisonment of women a "more intolerable tyranny than any civilized country in our day [has] been subjected to."&lt;ref name="NYT England"&gt;{{cite news|title=Our Affairs in England: Gen. Butler's Proclamation in the House of Lords Mediation|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 27, 1862}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Saturday Review (London newspaper)|Saturday Review]]'' criticized Gen. Butler's rule, accusing him of "gratifying his own revenge" and likening him to an uncivilized dictator:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If he had possessed any of the honourable feeling which is usually associated with a soldier's profession, he would not have made war on women. If he had even been endowed with the ordinary magnanimity of a Red Indian, his revenge would have been satiated before now. It required not only the nature of a savage, but of a very mean and pitiful kind of savage, to be induced by indignation at a woman's smile to inflict an imprisonment so degrading in its character as that which seems to constitute his favourite punishment, and accompanied by privations so cruel…It is only a pity that so unadulterated a barbarian should have got hold of an Anglo-Saxon name.&lt;ref name=London&gt;{{cite journal|title=General Butler|journal=Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science, and Art|date=October 18, 1862|volume=14|issue=364|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Southern women were highly offended by the order. Catherine Ann Devereux Edmonston, wife of North Carolina plantation owner Patrick Muir Edmonston, expressed horrified shock in her diary. She referred to it as "cold blooded barbarity" and expressed extreme disdain for not only Gen. Butler, but for Northerners as a whole: "We no longer will hold any intercourse with you, ye puritanical, deceitful race." Edmonston even went so far as to blame Gen. Butler's wife for creating the order as a show of her "ferocity against the real ladies of New Orleans" after she was rejected from New Orleans society.&lt;ref name=Edmonston&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmonston|first=Catherine Ann Devereux|title="Journal of a Secesh Lady": The Diary of Catherine Ann Devereux Edmonston, 1860-1866|date=1979|publisher=North Carolina Division of Archives and History|location=Raleigh|isbn=9780865260474|page=182|editor=Beth G. Crabtree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clara Solomon, a 17-year-old [[Jewish]] girl from New Orleans, expressed similar feelings. She found the order unnecessary and offensive, asking, "what anyway could a woman's taunts do to" the Union soldiers.&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Clara|title=The Civil War Diary of Clara Solomon: Growing Up in New Orelans, 1861-1862|date=1995|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=9780807119686|page=430|editor=Elliott Ashkenazi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John T.

Gen. Butler himself wrote a letter defending his actions in New Orleans, claiming "the devil had entered the hearts of the women of [New Orleans]…to stir up strife" and falsely claimed that the order had been very effective. He said the effective way to deal with a woman who was to be treated as a woman of the town was to ignore her.&lt;ref name="NYT Defend"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gen. Butler Defends the Woman order|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 16, 1862}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, some thought the language of the order was too ambiguous, and feared that Union troops would treat New Orleans women like prostitutes in regards to soliciting them for sex and perhaps even rape.&lt;ref name=Rable&gt;{{cite book|last=Rable|first=George|title=Divided Houses: Gender and the Civil War|date=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195080343|page=140|editor=Catherine Clinton|chapter="Missing in Action": Women of the Confederacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eugenia Levy Phillips==

Eugenia Levy Phillips was one woman who was imprisoned under the Woman's Order.  Phillips was a good family friend of Clara Solomon, who expressed great shock at her imprisonment for "laughing and mocking" at the remains of Union Lieutenant George Coleman De Kay, Jr. during his funeral procession.&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt; Catherine Edmonston sympathized with Phillips and the "foul wrong" and "horrible outrage" placed against her.&lt;ref name=Edmonstonp219&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmonston|first=Catherine Ann Devereux|title="Journal of a Secesh Lady": The Diary of Catherine Ann Devereux Edmonston, 1860-1866|date=1979|publisher=North Carolina Division of Archives and History|location=Raleigh|isbn=9780865260474|page=219|editor=Beth G.

After the war, Phillips protested the way she was portrayed as a spy, calling the accusations "shameful" and condemning.

==Aftermath==

Gen. Butler claimed that the order was effective in quieting the women of New Orleans, but he was only partially correct. Women in New Orleans still presented a very real political and military threat to the imposing Union Army, despite only a small number of women continuing to be politically active after the order and the arrest of Eugenia Levy Phillips.&lt;ref name=Longp31&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Alecia P.|title=Occupied Women: Gender, Military Occupation, and the American Civil War|date=2009|publisher=Louisiana State University|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=9780807137178|page=31|editor=LeeAnn Whites}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gen. Butler was removed from his command of New Orleans on December 16, 1862. The international attention garnered from the Order contributed greatly to his removal from New Orleans, as did his threats aimed at foreign consuls.&lt;ref name=Hearnp217&gt;{{cite book|last=Hearn|first=Chester G.|title=When the Devil Came Down to Dixie: Ben Butler in New Orleans|date=1997|publisher=Louisiana State University|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=9780807121801|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Armoiries de Jérusalem.svg|thumb|right|125px|[[Cross of Jerusalem|Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem]].]]
The '''Haute Cour''' ({{lang-en|High Court}}) was the [[feudal]] [[council]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. It was sometimes also called the ''curia generalis'', the ''curia regis'', or, rarely, the ''parlement''.

==Composition of the court==

The Haute Cour was a combination of [[legislative]] and [[judicial]] powers. It had its basis in [[medieval]] [[parliament]]arian ideals: a [[monarch|sovereign]] desired the consent of his subjects in certain matters, such as [[taxation]] and obligations to conduct [[military]] service.

The court developed gradually during the early 12th century [[AD]], along with the kingdom itself, in the aftermath of the [[First Crusade]]. Technically all [[Vassals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|vassals of the king]] which were subject to its decisions had the right to sit and vote, but in practice only the more wealthy [[Nobility|noble]]s did so; certain nobles attended regularly and tended to serve as presiding [[judge]]s when necessary. This developed into a system of higher nobles (direct vassals of the [[Kings of Jerusalem|king]]) and lesser nobles (indirect vassals, who owed service to the higher nobles), with different privileges depending on idiosyncratic circumstances. Anyone who had committed [[perjury]] or had broken an [[oath]] (whether a higher or lesser noble) forfeited his right to speak and vote. Only four votes (the king and any three vassals) were required to form a [[quorum]]. 

The court could meet wherever necessary, not solely in [[Jerusalem]]. After around 1120 the court also included [[bishop]]s, and according to tradition new crusaders were entitled to sit and vote; the first time this occurred was the [[Council of Acre]] on 24 June 1148 during the [[Second Crusade]], when the fatal decision to attack [[Damascus]] was made. Later the masters of the [[Military order (society)|military orders]] were entitled to sit and vote as well. During the 12th century there was also a smaller group of advisors to the king, but by the end of the century this group had fallen out of use.

==Duties of the court==
The court levied taxes on the inhabitants of the kingdom, and voted on military expeditions. A formal vote for war would mobilize all the vassals of the kingdom. The court was the only judicial body for the nobles of the kingdom, hearing cases of murder, rape, assault, wardship, debt, recovery of slaves, sales and purchases of fiefs and horses, default of service, inheritance, and treason. Punishments included forfeiture of land and exile, or in extreme cases death. It was possible to escape punishment from the court by challenging all the appointed judges to a [[trial by combat]] and defeating them (but this was of course impractical and was never done). The court was also responsible for [[mint (coin)|minting]] coins.

Most importantly, the court elected the king or his regent, or settled disputes between various claimants. Each new reign began with a meeting of the court, to formally recognize the new king and to swear an oath of homage to him. They also gave advice to the king and developed proper procedures for doing so, but in practise they could disagree with the king and override his wishes. Essentially, the king was only "[[first among equals]]" while sitting in the court, although he was recognized as its head (in the king's absence the court was presided over by his [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|seneschal]]).

==Factions within the court==
There tended to be two factions within the court, a so-called "court party," consisting of the royal family, the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]], and their supporters, and the "nobles' party," consisting of the higher nobility and the military orders. Disputes between the two factions were frequent. There was a major dispute during the co-reign of [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] and her son [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], when Melisende refused to give up the crown after Baldwin came of age. Baldwin eventually gained the support of the nobility and was recognized as sole king. A second major dispute arose during the regency of [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] for the child-king [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]], when the relative newcomer [[Guy of Lusignan]] was chosen by the court party over more experienced nobles. This decision would eventually lead to increased conflict with the Muslims and the fall of Jerusalem itself in 1187.

==The ''Assise sur la ligece''==
Perhaps the most important piece of legislation passed by the court was [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]]'s ''[[Assise sur la ligece]]''. The ''Assise'' formally prohibited the illegal confiscation of fiefs and required all of the king's vassals to ally against any lord who did so. Such a lord would not be given a trial, but would instead be stripped of his land or exiled. It also made all nobles direct vassals of the king, eliminating the previous distinction between higher and lesser nobles. This distinction still existed in reality, and although lesser nobles now had an equal voice in the court, the more powerful barons refused to be tried by lesser lords who were not their peers. The higher nobles were still able to judge the less powerful lords themselves. There were about 600 men eligible to vote in the Court according to the Assise.

==The court in the 13th century==
There was also a ''Cour des Bourgeois'' in the kingdom but in the 12th century the two do not seem to have met together. They began to do so in the 13th century when the capital of the kingdom had been moved to Acre, and the leaders of the merchant colonies in the coastal cities were also allowed to sit (but not vote). By this time central authority had eroded so much that the more powerful nobles often had their own courts. 

[[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] opposed the authority of the court while he was staying in Acre during the [[Fifth Crusade]], and it was temporarily abolished from 1232 to 1244. In its place the Commune of Acre was set up, which invoked the Assise against him, although his army was much larger than any force the remnant of the kingdom could muster. The Commune, unlike the Court, included the burgesses. Meanwhile, the ''Haute Cour'' of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] adopted basically the same structure.

==Significance==
Most of our information on the court comes from [[John of Ibelin (jurist)|John of Ibelin]]'s description of it, written in the 1260s. His description was an idealized explanation of the laws and procedures, based on the idea that [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], the first king of Jerusalem, had personally established it and that it had remained unchanged since then (in the 13th century Godfrey was already a legendary figure). This was not the case, although it did develop much more slowly than similar contemporary courts elsewhere in Europe. Unlike [[France]] or [[England]], the kingdom was not developing into a centralized [[parliament]]ary government – in fact it developed the opposite way, with the king losing more and more power to the barons. The court had essentially fossilized the feudalism of northern France circa 1100; because the kingdom was constantly at war, covered so little land, had so few westerners, and survived in Jerusalem for less than a hundred years, it did not have a chance to develop into a true Parliament.  

John of Ibelin's description, while useful, was taken too literally by later historians. In the 19th century, the court was commonly held to be the purest representation of feudalism in all of the [[Middle Ages]], although today this is considered too simplistic. The court was in some ways a fairly typical feudal court, but was adapted to the specific circumstances of the [[crusades]] and of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4541">'''Imperfect self-defense''' is a [[common law]] doctrine recognized by some jurisdictions whereby a [[defendant]] may mitigate [[punishment]] or [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] imposed for a crime involving the use of [[deadly force]] by claiming, as a partial [[affirmative defense]], the honest but unreasonable belief that the actions were necessary to counter an attack. Not all jurisdictions accept imperfect self-defense as a basis to reduce a murder charge.&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite book|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, Volume 9|date=1998|publisher=West|isbn=9780314201669|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j407AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 September 2017}} (Self-Defense).&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Right of self-defense|Self-defense]]''': A ''perfect'' argument of self-defense proves all elements of self-defense, and results in the defendant's acquittal. If a defendant proves imperfect self-defense, the defendant will be convicted of a lesser homicide charge, such as [[voluntary manslaughter]].&lt;ref name="west"/&gt;
* '''Imperfect self-defense''': The concept of ''imperfect'' self-defense is that, although not all elements of self-defense were proved, extenuating circumstances nonetheless ''partially'' excuse the act that caused death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Homicide and Murder|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-homicide-and-murder|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The doctrine of imperfect self-defense has been defined as "an intentional killing committed with an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances justified deadly force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State v. Jones, 8 P. 3d 1282, 27 Kan. App. 2d 910 (2000)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15201994062332957609|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a person had a good faith belief that deadly force was necessary to repel an attack, but the person's belief was unreasonable, that person would be able to raise imperfect self-defense as a defense to a murder charge.&lt;ref name="west"/&gt;

A court in [[Maryland]], held that:
{{quote|When evidence is presented showing the defendant’s subjective belief that the use of force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm, the defendant is entitled to a proper instruction on imperfect [[self defense]]....The theory underlying the doctrine is that when a defendant uses deadly force with an honest but '''unreasonable''' belief that it is necessary to defend himself, the element of malice, necessary for a murder conviction, is lacking.}}
''State v. Faulkner'', 483 A.2d 759, 769 (Md. 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State v. Faulkner, 483 A.2d 759, 769, 301 Md. 482 (Md. 1984)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17158253875987176431|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan recognizes imperfect self-defense as a qualified defense that may mitigate second-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clemency Manual, Appendix 8: Michigan Standard Jury Instructions|url=http://www.umich.edu/~clemency/clemency_mnl/a8.html|website=Michigan Women's Justice &amp; Clemency Project|publisher=University of Michigan Law School|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the doctrine can only be used where the defendant would have had a right to self-defense but for the fact that the defendant was the initial aggressor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People v. Deason, 148 Mich. App. 27, 31, 384 N.W.2d 72 (1985)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12817597905673513987|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. state of [[California]] a defendant can be convicted of [[manslaughter]] but not [[murder]] when imperfect self-defense is successfully proved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People v. Humphrey 13 Cal. 4th 1073, 921 P. 2d 1 (1996)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9566017733093582200|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grumer|first1=Janet|title=IX.

According to this agreement, control over the water flowing in three "eastern" rivers of India — the [[Beas River|Beas]], the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] and the [[Sutlej]] with the mean flow of 33 million acre-feet (MAF) — was given to India, while control over the water flowing in three "western" rivers of India — the [[Indus River|Indus]], the [[Chenab River|Chenab]] and the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] with the mean flow of 80 [[Acre-foot|MAF]] — was given to Pakistan.&lt;ref name=jk/&gt; More controversial, however, were the provisions on how the waters were to be shared. Since Pakistan's rivers receive more water flow from India, the treaty allowed India to use western rivers water for limited [[irrigation]] use and unrestricted use for power generation, domestic, industrial and non consumptive uses such as navigation, floating of property, fish culture, etc. while laying down precise regulations for India to build projects. The preamble of the treaty declares that the objectives of the treaty are recognizing rights &amp; obligations of each country in settlement of water use from the Indus System of Rivers  in a spirit of goodwill, friendship and cooperation contrary to the fears of Pakistan that India could potentially create floods or [[drought]]s in Pakistan, especially at times of war since substantial water inflows of the Indus basin rivers are from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/node/2236| title= Indus Water Treaty: Review is not an Option|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IWT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf| title= Full text of 'Indus Water Treaty' with Annexures, World Bank |date= 1960|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[ratification]] of the treaty in 1960, India and Pakistan have not engaged in any water wars. Most disagreements and disputes have been settled via legal procedures, provided for within the framework of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claws.in/images/journals_doc/867954295_04_chap.pdf|title=Indus Water Treaty: Options for India |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty is considered to be one of the most successful water sharing endeavours in the world today, even though analysts acknowledge the need to update certain technical specifications and expand the scope of the document to include [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=indus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/10345110617.pdf|title=The Indus Equation Report|publisher=Strategic Foresight Group|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the provisions in the treaty, India can use  (excluding domestic, industrial and non consumptive uses from western rivers) nearly 20% of the total water carried by the Indus System of Rivers  while Pakistan can use the remaining.&lt;ref name="Brebbia2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.A.

The Indus System of Rivers comprises three western rivers — the Indus, the Jhelum and Chenab — and three eastern rivers — the Sutlej, the Beas and the Ravi. Per Article I of IWT, any river/ tributary and its catchment area of Indus System of Rivers which are not part of other five rivers, is part of Indus river including its creeks, [[Distributary|delta channel]]s, connecting lakes, etc. According to this treaty, the eastern rivers are allocated for exclusive water use by India after the permitted water uses in Pakistan before they cross finally into Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistan has exclusive water use of the western rivers after the permitted water uses in India. Article IV (14) of IWT states that any water use developed out of the underutilized waters of other country, will not acquire water use rights due to lapse of time.&lt;ref name=Indus/&gt; Mostly, the treaty resulted in partitioning of the rivers rather than sharing of their waters.&lt;ref name="conflicts, p.98"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gee-21.org/publications/pdf%20files/Conflictsbetweencountriesvol.3Jan.2004.pdf |format=pdf |title=Water Sharing Conflicts Between Countries, and Approaches to Resolving Them |accessdate=2010-04-14 |page=98 |publisher=Global Environment and Energy in the 21st century |location=Honolulu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821023229/http://www.gee-21.org/publications/pdf%20files/Conflictsbetweencountriesvol.3Jan.2004.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Transition period of 10 years was permitted in which India was bound to supply water to Pakistan from its eastern rivers until Pakistan was able to build the [[canal]] system for utilization of waters of the western rivers. Per Article 5.1 of IWT, India agreed to make fixed contribution of UK Pound Streling 62,060,000/= (Pound Streling sixty two million and sixty thousand only) towards the cost of construction of new head-works and canal system for irrigation from western rivers in Punjab province of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thedialogue.co/struggle-power-indus/|title= The struggle for power over Indus |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; India had to pay this amount in ten equal installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shreyan|first1=Sengupta|title=Transboundary water disputes|url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:7481/eth-7481-01.pdf|website=ETH Zurich|publisher=ETH Zurich|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garg&gt;{{Cite book|last=Garg|first= Santosh Kumar|title= International and interstate river water disputes|pages=54–55|accessdate=2010-04-14|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nrcqGF3agsEC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Ravi+River&amp;q=Ravi%20River|publisher= Laxmi Publications|year=1999|isbn=81-7008-068-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Indus&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTSOUTHASIA/Resources/223497-1105737253588/IndusWatersTreaty1960.pdf|format=pdf|title=Indus Waters Treaty 1960|pages=1–24|publisher=Site Resources; World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both countries agreed to exchange data and co-operate in matters related to the treaty. For this purpose, treaty creates the [[Permanent Indus Commission]], with a commissioner appointed by each country. It would follow the set procedure for adjudicating any future differences and disputes arising over the allocation of waters. The Commission has survived [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|three wars]] and provides an ongoing mechanism for consultation and conflict resolution through inspection, exchange of data and visits. The Commission is required to meet at least once in a year to discuss potential disputes as well as cooperative arrangements for the development of the Indus System of Rivers. Either party must notify the other of plans to construct any engineering works which would affect the other party and to provide data about such works. The annual inspections and exchange of data continue, unperturbed by tensions on the subcontinent. [[Salal Hydroelectric Power Station| Salal dam]] was constructed after entering mutual agreement by both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agreement for the Salal project between India and Pakistan dated 14 April 1978 |url=http://www.commonlii.org/in/other/treaties/INTSer/1978/18.pdf|accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of disagreement, [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]  (PCA) or a neutral technical expert is called in for arbitration.

==History and background==
The waters of the Indus System of Rivers begin mainly in [[Tibet]], [[Afghanistan]], and the [[Himalayan mountains]] in the states of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]]. They flow through the states of [[Punjab]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochitan]], [[Kabul Province|Kabul]], [[Kandahar Province| Kandahar]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], Himachal Pradesh, [[Haryana]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Gujarat]], Jammu and Kashmir, [[Sindh]], etc before emptying into the [[Arabian Sea]] south of Karachi and [[Kori Creek]] in Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/|title= Interactive map - Indus system of rivers |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where once there was only a narrow strip of irrigated land along these rivers, developments over the last century have created a large network of canals and storage facilities that provide water for more than {{convert|47|e6acre|km2}} in Pakistan alone by 2009, one of the largest irrigated area of any one river system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lahoreschoolofeconomics.edu.pk/EconomicsJournal/Journals/Volume%2015/Issue%20SP/09%20Dr%20Shahid%20Chaudhry%20EDITED%20TTC11-10-10.pdf|title= Pakistan: Indus Basin Water Strategy – Past, Present and Future |accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Partition of India|partition of British India]] created a conflict over the plentiful waters of the Indus basin. The newly formed states were at odds over how to share and manage what was essentially a cohesive and unitary network of irrigation. Furthermore, the geography of partition was such that the source rivers of the Indus basin were in India. Pakistan felt its livelihood threatened by the prospect of Indian control over the [[Tributary|tributaries]] that fed water into the Pakistani portion of the basin. Where India certainly had its own ambitions for the profitable development of the basin, Pakistan felt acutely threatened by a conflict over the main source of water for its cultivable land.

During the first years of partition, the waters of the Indus were apportioned by the Inter-Dominion Accord of May 4, 1948. This accord required India to release sufficient waters to the Pakistani regions of the basin in return for annual payments from the government of Pakistan. The accord was meant to meet immediate requirements and was followed by negotiations for a more permanent solution. However, neither side was willing to compromise their respective positions and negotiations reached a stalemate. From the Indian point of view, there was nothing that Pakistan could do to prevent India from any of the schemes to divert the flow of water in the rivers.&lt;ref name="dawn"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cssforum.com.pk/css-compulsory-subjects/pakistan-affairs/33166-what-indus-water-treaty-means.html|title= What Indus water treaty means |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan wanted to take the matter at that time to the [[International Court of Justice]], but India refused, arguing that the conflict required a bilateral resolution.

==World Bank involvement==

In this same year, [[David Lilienthal]], formerly the chairman of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] and of the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], visited the region to write a series of articles for ''[[Collier's]]'' magazine. Lilienthal had a keen interest in the subcontinent and was welcomed by the highest levels of both Indian and Pakistani governments. Although his visit was sponsored by ''Collier's'', Lilienthal was briefed by state department and executive branch officials, who hoped that Lilienthal could help bridge the gap between India and Pakistan and also gauge hostilities on the subcontinent. During the course of his visit, it became clear to Lilienthal that tensions between India and Pakistan were acute, but also unable to be erased with one sweeping gesture. He wrote in his journal:&lt;blockquote&gt;India and Pakistan were on the verge of war over Kashmir. There seemed to be no possibility of negotiating this issue until tensions abated. One way to reduce hostility . . . would be to concentrate on other important issues where cooperation was possible. Progress in these areas would promote a sense of community between the two nations which might, in time, lead to a Kashmir settlement. Accordingly, I proposed that India and Pakistan work out a program jointly to develop and jointly to operate the Indus Basin river system, upon which both nations were dependent for irrigation water. With new dams and irrigation canals, the Indus and its tributaries could be made to yield the additional water each country needed for increased food production. In the article I had suggested that the World Bank might use its good offices to bring the parties to agreement, and help in the financing of an Indus Development program.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Niranjan Das Gulhati|Gulhati, Niranjan D.]], ''The Indus Waters Treaty: An Exercise in International Mediation'', Allied Publishers: Bombay, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|93}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Lilienthal's idea was well received by officials at the World Bank (then the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and subsequently, by the Indian and Pakistani governments. [[Eugene R. Black, Sr.|Eugene R. Black]], then president of the World Bank, told Lilienthal that his proposal "makes good sense all round". Black wrote that the Bank was interested in the [[Economic development|economic progress]] of the two countries and had been concerned that the Indus dispute could only be a serious handicap to this development. India's previous objections to third party arbitration were remedied by the Bank's insistence that it would not adjudicate the conflict but rather work as a conduit for agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Edward Sagendorph|last2=Asher|first2=Robert E.|title=The World Bank Since Bretton Woods|date=1973|publisher=The Brookings Institution|location=Wawshington|isbn=9780815720300|page=612|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4VmW98hZy8C&amp;pg=PA612&amp;lpg=PA612&amp;dq=lilienthal+world+bank&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hflTqJ3PvB&amp;sig=pxEXF3A4KU5HBLnjoMVtEhSIuEk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QZZPVODsBavG7Ab984DgDA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lilienthal%20world%20bank&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black also made a distinction between the "functional" and "political" aspects of the Indus dispute. In his correspondence with Indian and Pakistan leaders, Black asserted that the Indus dispute could most realistically be solved if the functional aspects of disagreement were negotiated apart from political considerations. He envisioned a group that tackled the question of how best to utilize the waters of the Indus Basin, leaving aside questions of historic rights or allocations.

Black proposed a Working Party made up of Indian, Pakistani and World Bank engineers. The World Bank delegation would act as a consultative group, charged with offering suggestions and speeding dialogue. In his opening statement to the Working Party, Black spoke of why he was optimistic about the group's success:&lt;blockquote&gt;One aspect of Mr. Lilienthal's proposal appealed to me from the first. I mean his insistence that the Indus problem is an engineering problem and should be dealt with by engineers. One of the strengths of the engineering profession is that, all over the world, engineers speak the same language and approach problems with common standards of judgment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|110}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Black's hopes for a quick resolution to the Indus dispute were premature. While the Bank had expected that the two sides would come to an agreement on the allocation of waters, neither India nor Pakistan seemed willing to compromise their positions. While Pakistan insisted on its historical right to waters of all the Indus tributaries and that half of [[West Punjab]] was under threat of [[desertification]], the Indian side argued that the previous distribution of waters should not set future allocation. Instead, the Indian side set up a new basis of distribution, with the waters of the Western tributaries going to Pakistan and the Eastern tributaries to India. The substantive technical discussions that Black had hoped for were stymied by the political considerations he had expected to avoid.

The World Bank soon became frustrated with this lack of progress. What had originally been envisioned as a technical dispute that would quickly untangle itself started to seem intractable. India and Pakistan were unable to agree on the technical aspects of allocation, let alone the implementation of any agreed upon distribution of waters. Finally, in 1954, after nearly two years of negotiation, the World bank offered its own proposal, stepping beyond the limited role it had apportioned for itself and forcing the two sides to consider concrete plans for the future of the basin. The proposal offered India the three eastern tributaries of the basin and Pakistan the three western tributaries. Canals and storage dams were to be constructed to divert waters from the western rivers and replace the eastern river supply lost by Pakistan.

While the Indian side was amenable to the World Bank proposal, Pakistan found it unacceptable. The World Bank allocated the eastern rivers to India and the western rivers to Pakistan. This new distribution did not account for the historical usage of the Indus basin, or the fact that West Punjab's Eastern districts could turn into desert, and repudiated Pakistan's negotiating position. Where India had stood for a new system of allocation, Pakistan felt that its share of waters should be based on pre-partition distribution. The World Bank proposal was more in line with the Indian plan and this angered the Pakistani delegation. They threatened to withdraw from the Working Party, and negotiations verged on collapse.

However, neither side could afford the dissolution of talks. The Pakistani press met rumors of an end to negotiation with talk of increased hostilities; the government was ill-prepared to forego talks for a violent conflict with India and was forced to reconsider its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=War on Indus waters?|url=https://www.frontline.in/books/war-on-indus-waters/article9730422.ece|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends Not Masters - A Political Autobiography By President Ayub Khan (pages 109 to 112)|url=https://archive.org/stream/FriendsNotMastersAPoliticalAutobiographyByPresidentAyubKhan_201705/Friends-Not-Masters-A%20Political%20Autobiography%20by-President%20Ayub-Khan-#page/n1/mode/1up|date= 1967|accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; India was also eager to settle the Indus issue; large development projects were put on hold by negotiations, and Indian leaders were eager to divert water for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India and Pakistan: An Atlantic report|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1960/11/india-and-pakistan/306376/|year=1960|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1954, the two sides returned to the negotiating table. The World Bank proposal was transformed from a basis of settlement to a basis for negotiation and the talks continued, stop and go, for the next six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/insights/insight20060601a.html |title=Indus Waters Treaty: View From Kashmir |date= 2006|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the last stumbling blocks to an agreement concerned financing for the construction of canals and storage facilities that would transfer water from the western rivers to Pakistan. This transfer was necessary to make up for the water Pakistan was giving up by ceding its rights to the eastern rivers. The World Bank initially planned for India to pay for these works, but India refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://indianstrategicknowledgeonline.com/web/MEDIATING%20THE%20INDUS%20WATER%20TREATLY.pdf |title=Water Rationality: Mediating the Indus Waters Treaty|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bank responded with a plan for external financing.  An ''Indus Basin Development Fund Agreement'' ([[Karachi]], 19 September 1960); a treaty between [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[West Germany]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] with the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (IRDC) and Pakistan who agreed to provide a combination of funds and loans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1961/2.html&lt;/ref&gt; This solution cleared the remaining stumbling blocks to agreement, and the Indus Waters Treaty was signed by the leaders of both countries on the same day in 1960.&lt;ref name=iwt1&gt;{{cite web|title=Indus water treaty|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/0,,contentMDK:22557065~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:223547,00.html|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grants and loans to Pakistan were extended in 1964 through a supplementary agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1964/14.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the World Bank role in the treaty is limited to keep the dispute settlement process moving when a party/country is not cooperating to follow the arbitration procedure given in the treaty in case of a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Last page of the Indus Water Treaty&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iwt1/&gt;

== Treaty implications ==
From the Indus System of Rivers, India got nearly 33 million acre feet (MAF) at 20% whereas Pakistan got nearly 125 MAF at 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiawaterreview.in/Story/BestoftheWeb/india-generous-with-its-shared-water-resources/825/8 |title=India generous with its shared water resources|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However India can use the western river waters for irrigation up to 701,000 acres with new water storage capacity not exceeding 1.25 MAF and new storage works with hydro power plants (excluding unlimited run of the river hydro projects) with storage not exceeding 1.6 MAF and nominal flood storage capacity of 0.75 MAF.&lt;ref name=indus/&gt; These water allocations made to the [[Jammu and Kashmir state]] of India are meager to meet its irrigation water requirements whereas the treaty permitted enough water to irrigate 80% of the cultivated lands in the Indus river basin of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikashmir.net/geography/chapter2.1.html |title=Geography of Jammu and Kashmir State|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/news/legislative-assembly-rejects-pdp-resolution/59434.html |title=Legislative Assembly rejects PDP resolution|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storage capacity permitted by the treaty for hydro power generation is less than the total annual silt that would accumulate in the reservoirs if the total hydro potential of the state was to be exploited fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/365955283/Harnessing-gigantic-hydro-power-potential-of-Indus-Jhelum-and-Chenab-rivers-in-India  |title=Harnessing gigantic hydro power potential of Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers in India|accessdate=30 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan is also losing additional benefits by not permitting moderate water storage in upstream J&amp;K state whose water would be ultimately released to the Pakistan for its use and avoid few dams requirement in its territory. Ultimately, J&amp;K state is bound to resort to costly de-silting of its reservoirs to keep them operational. Whereas Pakistan is planning to build multi purpose water reservoirs with massive storage for impounding multi year inflows such as 4,500 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] [[Diamer-Bhasha Dam]], 3,600 MW [[Kalabagh Dam]], 600 MW [[Akhori Dam]], [[Dasu Dam]], [[Bunji Dam]], Thakot dam, Patan dam, etc. projects with huge population resettlement.&lt;ref name=indus/&gt; In case of any dam break, downstream areas in Pakistan as well as Kutch region in India would face unprecedented water deluge or submergence as these dams are located in high seismically-active zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/pakistans-indus-cascade-a-disaster-in-the-making/59474499 |title=Pakistan's Indus Cascade - a disaster in the making|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty under scrutiny==
{{Main|Great Rann of Kutch}}
The treaty has not considered [[Gujarat]] state in India as part of the Indus river basin. The Indus river is entering the [[Rann of Kutch]] area and feeding in to [[Kori Creek]] during floods. At the time of the Indus Waters Treaty in 1960, the [[Great Rann of Kutch]] area was disputed territory between the two nations which was later settled in the year 1968 by sharing total disputed area in 9:1 ratio between India and Pakistan. Without taking consent from India, Pakistan has constructed [[Left Bank Outfall Drain]] (LBOD) project passing through the Great Rann of Kutch area with the assistance from the world bank. LBOD's purpose is to bypass the saline and polluted water which is not fit for agriculture use to reach sea via Rann of Kutch area without passing through its [[Indus delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://lubpak.com/archives/58775|title=Revisiting the LBOD issue|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water released by the LBOD is enhancing the flooding in India and contaminating the quality of water bodies which are source of water to [[salt farm]]s spread over vast area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indus-river-re-enters-india/1/158976.html|title=Indus re-enters India after two centuries, feeds Little Rann, Nal Sarovar|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LBOD water is planned to join the sea via disputed [[Sir Creek]] but LBOD water is entering Indian territory due to many breaches in its left bank caused by floods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTINSPECTIONPANEL/Resources/PAKNDPProgressRepANNEXES.pdf |title=Evolution of the Delta, the LBOD outfall system and the Badin dhands - chapters 3 &amp; 4|date=2006|publisher= World Bank|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gujarat state of India being the lower most riparian part of Indus basin, Pakistan is bound to provide all the details of engineering works taken up by Pakistan to India as per the provisions of the treaty and shall not proceed with the project works till the disagreements are settled by arbitration process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.livemint.com/Politics/iuPCUnmFn62w0HTyAkgtZJ/India-Pakistan-agree-on-IWT-mandated-tours-to-both-sides-of.html |title=India, Pakistan agree on IWT mandated tours to both sides of Indus basin |accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/wrangles-over-water-as-karnataka-and-tamil-nadu-slug-it-out-pakistan-wages-a-water-war-on-india/ |title=Wrangles over water: Pakistan wages a water war on India|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors''' is a treaty of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) that was adopted at [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], on March 19, 1994, at the Fifth Inter-American Specialized Conference On [[Private International Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/sigs/b-53.html |title=International Treaties: Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors |date=  |accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In consideration of the importance of ensuring comprehensive and effective protection for minors, through appropriate mechanisms to guarantee respect for their rights, and awareness that the international traffic of minors is a universal concern in the light of conventions on the international protection of minors, particularly the provisions of Articles 11 and 35 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], and convinced of the need to regulate civil and penal aspects of the international traffic in minors, the OAS reaffirmed the importance of international cooperation to achieve effective protection of the best interests of minors by agreeing upon the Inter-American Convention on the International Return of Children.

==Convention aims==

The Convention begins by broadly describing its intent in Article 1:

{{quote|The purpose of the present Convention, with a view to protection of the fundamental rights of minors and their best interests, is the prevention and punishment of the international traffic in minors as well as the regulation of its civil and penal aspects.}}

Accordingly, the States Parties to this Convention undertake to: 

a) ensure the protection of minors in consideration of their best interests; 

b) institute a system of mutual legal assistance among the States Parties, dedicated to the prevention and punishment of the international traffic in minors, as well as adopt related administrative and legal provisions to that effect; and 

c) ensure the prompt return of minors who are victims of international traffic to the State of their habitual residence, bearing in mind the best interests of the minors.|Article 1|Inter-American Convention on the International Return of Children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/dil/treaties_B-57_Inter-American_Convention_on_International_Traffic_in_Minors.htm |title=Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors |date= |accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==

Over half of the 35 Member States of the Organisation of American States are party to the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]], and over a third of Member States are also party to the Inter-American Convention on the International Return of Children. When a State is party to both Conventions, Article 34 of the Inter-American Convention assigns priority to the Inter-American Convention over the Hague Abduction Convention unless otherwise agreed upon between the States individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.incadat.com/index.cfm?act=text.text&amp;id=4&amp;lng=1 |title=Inter-American Convention Section |publisher=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law|HCCH]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To date there are no known instances of this Convention being used for [[parental child trafficking]].

A '''legal secretary''' is a particular category of worker within the legal profession.

In the [[practice of law]] in the [[United States]], a legal secretary is person who works in the legal profession, typically assisting [[lawyer]]s. Legal secretaries help by preparing and filing [[legal document]]s, such as [[appeal]]s or [[Motion (legal)|motions]].  It is not unusual for a larger firm to place managerial duties on a particular legal secretary. Much like a [[paralegal]], a legal secretary is responsible for locating relevant information for cases. This type of person would be called a "paralegal" in the UK.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], a legal secretary is a secretary experienced in working for a [[law firm]] or [[in-house]] [[General counsel|legal department]]. They assist by giving administrative support to lawyers and are significant members of a team of professionals who work together. The work of a legal secretary varies. They deal with a wide range of challenging legal and business issues, combining their skills with modern technology.

In [[Ceylon]], it used to refer to the head of islands legal arms such as the Attorney General's Office and the Legal Draftsman's office during the British colonial period.

==Educational background==
There is no specific educational requirement in most [[U.S. state]]s for legal secretaries.  However, unlike an [[Secretary|administrative assistant]], a legal secretary must be familiar with legal procedures. Many colleges and universities offer programs geared towards this career, however, there is not a degree associated with that of a legal secretary.  Rather, students are enrolled in existing legal courses, which have been established for those who wish to pursue a career in law, such as a lawyer or [[police officer]].

In the [[UK]], they provide secretarial and clerical support to solicitors, barristers and the law courts. Their primary responsibilities are to deal with correspondence and preparation of legal documents such as wills, divorce petitions and witness statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/careers/becoming-a-solicitor/alternative-careers/ |title=Alternative Careers |publisher=lawsociety.org.uk |date= |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A legal secretary should have excellent secretarial skills together with a knowledge of law and [[legal procedures]]. They must be computer literate and have a good standard of English. People can acquire the legal skills they need through training companies, local colleges or some law firms are willing to train people themselves.

'''Listing and approval use and compliance''' is the activity of adhering to specific testing requirements designed to establish minimum performance for the installation or use of safety-related products and materials in conformance with an ''active'' [[certification listing]] or ''approval'' that has been issued by an organization that is accredited both for testing and [[product certification]], such as those issued by [[Underwriters Laboratories]], [[NTA Inc]], [[FM Global]], American Nuclear Insurers, or the [[Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik]] (DIBt). In concept, if a product, such as a [[fire door]], [[fire extinguisher]], or [[toaster]], is used in the intended manner, the component or system will perform as described in the listing and/or ''approval''. The listing or test is often cited by a regulation, such as a [[building code]] or a fire code, and becomes enforcable through adopted codes or regulations. This concept is known as ''bounding'' in the nuclear industry. Products whose use is not mandated by any [[building code]]s or fire codes often lack a consensus test method. Unless there is a test standard in existence to prove the functionality and reliability of such a product, there can be no certification listing.  Many authorities are charged to review and approve results from qualified testing agencies, when for the purpose intended, the evidence shows compliance for a material, product or construction method that provides equivalent strength, quality, fire resistance, durability and safety when evaluated through general engineering practices.

== Governmental accreditation of laboratories ==
National, governmental accreditors, such as [[Germany]]'s [[Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik]] or [[Canada]]'s [http://www.scc.ca/ SCC (Standards Council of Canada)] can "accredit" laboratories, meaning that such laboratories must conform to national standards and rules of conduct in the discharge of their duties. Compliance is routinely tested by the accreditor through inspections, where random client files are audited to see that the laboratory followed all appropriate procedures. Accreditors can accredit laboratories for testing, as well as for [[product certification]]. In product certification regimes, the laboratory or the accreditor (as in the case of Germany) become involved in witnessing the production of test materials, get copies of process standards, including chemical formulas and all details necessary to manufacture a product. Once the test product is made, it is shipped "under seal" to the laboratory for incorporation in the test. Certification listings or approvals that follow a successful test are subject to the maintenance of continuous factory auditing to make sure that what was tested is identical to that which was made, or documented proof that the products made continue to meet quality control standards set out as a function of the approvals process.

== Testing by laboratories without national accreditation ==
Testing by organizations or laboratories who hold no national accreditation for testing purposes are not subject to mandatory governmental audits of compliance with applicable requirements. Even an organisation that is nationally accredited for testing purposes may not necessarily issue test reports that provide assurance that commercial products tested by it are the same as what is being sold or used by the public.

Safety related products undergo product certification to enable their use by the public. The value of testing by organizations without accreditation for product certification is based on [[faith]] in the organisation or its [[ethics]], or [[culpability]]. In countries in which a national authority is a present (e.g., the United States), the listings provided by large well established third-party testing and certification companies are accepted as the societal standard. In such cases, the link to the building code is through regional standards, such as the Uniform Building Code, or the Standard Building Code.

Manufacturers of products routinely test their own products and competitors' products for their own purposes, as it makes good fiscal sense to test in one's own lab before incurring the costs of a third party facility.

== Testing for the purpose of achieving product certification ==
Product certification involves testing a product to a test standard that is accepted in the region in which the product will be sold. For instance, in the case of a [[firestop]], [http://www.ulc.ca/ Underwriters' Laboratories of Canada] ULC-S115 is the test method that must be used by a laboratory whose tests are to be accepted in [[Canada]]. ULC is nationally accredited in Canada to write standards, test products and to certify products.

Because Canada uses the accreditation model of a national accrediting authority, if an organisation [[Fire test|tests a firestop]] in or for use in Canada, in accordance with the correct standard (ULC-S115), but is not accredited by the [http://www.scc.ca/ SCC], the test results cannot be used to in any approvals of field installations on Canadian construction sites. If, on the other hand, the test laboratory is also accredited for product certification, then before the test takes place, a follow-up or certification agreement is anticipated between the certifier and the submitter of the test who desires a rating or a listing. An [[inspector]] from the certifying organisation witnesses the manufacture of the product or products to be tested, and checks the manufacturing procedures against the process standard that is in place and by then on file with the certifying organisation. The process standard includes all information necessary to manufacture the product or products, including equipment descriptions, tolerances, chemical formulas and purchasing specifications for ingredients or components. The manufactured goods are sealed by the inspector and then shipped to the laboratory, where the contents are used to build the test specimen in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

Cheating in testing may include substitution of materials and components by the manufacturer, or additional measures to assure the product passes the test.

==Documentation==
After testing, the testing laboratory issues a test report to the manufacturer, who is not obliged to share it with anyone.

If the product passes the testing required for certification, the items in the test that passed are given a certification listing, which describes the product(s) that were tested, the application, and maximum and minimum tolerances for all components. Certification listings are short versions and interpretations of the test results.

A certification listing indicates that the test has been properly conducted, the tested systems passed, and that a follow-up agreement is in effect between the manufacturer or submitter and the certifier. This means that in addition to the original inspection where the test materials were produced, the certifier makes inspections of the manufacturing facility to ensure that what is being manufactured and sold is still the same as what was originally tested.

In the event that irregularities are discovered on the part of the manufacturer - substitutions of cheaper ingredients or components, deliberate irregularities, or an ingredient or component of a tested system which is no longer be available has been substituted - the listing can be de-activated and the manufacturer asked to remove all logos of the certifier from product literature, promotional materials, packaging, etc.

== Confidentiality ==
Organisations accredited for testing and certification of safety-related items typically operate in large facilities where many test submitters work to build test specimens and then go to test. Confidentiality is of importance to most submitters as well as the laboratories. Some manufacturers are extremely reluctant to share their proprietary process standards with any third parties.

In Germany's system, formulas and process standards are shared with the governmental accreditor: DIBt [http://www.dibt.de/]. DIBt uses the laboratories to audit the factories, but the audits are restricted to quality control tests of the finished products - not their chemical compositions or exact process standards. In North America, manufacturers are obliged to share their process standards with the laboratories, as there is no national accreditor that issues "approvals". This has resulted in the use of "fingerprinting" procedures, where manufacturers will permit their laboratory inspectors to conduct [[infrared spectroanalysis]] and other QC tests, in place of the process standards.

North American laboratories are usually private sector companies, though some of them are non-profit organisations, such as [[Underwriters Laboratories]]. There have been migrations of private sector laboratory engineers to manufacturers. Concerns over the sharing of confidential proprietary information are mitigated through confidentiality agreements.

==Structural fire protection==
Fire protection products used in the construction of buildings, ships and offshore facilities are required to conform with the certification listings or approvals. The field installation will comply with code requirements if it is configured within the maximum and minimum tolerances in the listings and approvals. For example, if a [[drywall]] assembly has a listing of a 2 hour [[fire-resistance rating]], and all the provisions of the listing were kept in the field, including materials, spacing, workmanship, etc., the 2 hour wall required by the building's designer is likely to withstand a 2 hour fire.

A case of the lack of mandatory bounding in US and Canadian [[nuclear power plant]] [[construction]] was the Thermo-Lag scandal, which was exposed by [[whistleblower]] [[Gerald W. Brown]]. The disclosure of the inadequacy of [[fire test]]ing employed in the [[circuit integrity]] product led to widespread and costly remedial work for licensees of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5210">'''Low-carbon buildings''' are buildings designed and constructed to release very little or no carbon at all during their lifetime.
{{TOC left}}

==Buildings and climate change==
Buildings alone are responsible for 38% &lt;ref&gt; U.S. EPA. 2008. Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gases Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2006, p. ES8.&lt;/ref&gt; of all human [[GHG emissions]] (20% residential, 18% commercial). It is the industrial sector which contributes the most to [[global warming]].

But according to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), it is also the sector which presents the most cost effective opportunities for GHG reductions.&lt;ref&gt; IPCC. 2007. Climate Change 2007 Synthesis Report, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==What are low-carbon buildings?==
Low-carbon buildings (LCB) are buildings which are specifically engineered with GHG reduction in mind. So by definition, a LCB is a building which emits significantly less GHG than regular buildings.

There is no emissions threshold under which a building would qualify as a LCB. But to be genuinely “Climate Change neutral”, a LCB would have to achieve at least 80% GHG reduction compared to traditional buildings. According to the [[Stern Review]] on the Economics of Climate Change, our emissions would have to be reduced by 80% compared to current levels in order not to exceed the Earth’s natural capacity to remove GHG from the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The Stern Review, Final Report, Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, a regular building releases about 5,000 kgCO2e/m2 during its entire lifetime (though it varies a lot, depending on the project type and where it is located).

==Low-carbon buildings technology==
GHGs are released in the atmosphere during each stage of a building's life:

* Building construction
* Building operation
* Building renovation and deconstruction

GHG reduction calculations should consider all stages of the building life: construction (incl. renovation and deconstruction) and operation.

===Construction===
GHG emissions associated with buildings construction are mainly coming from:
# Materials manufacturing (e.g., concrete)
# Materials transport
# Demolition wastes transport
# Demolition wastes treatment

The construction, renovation, and deconstruction of a typical building is on average responsible for the emissions of 1,000-1,500 kgCO2e/m2 (around 500 kgCO2e/m2 for construction only).

Strategies adopted by LCB to reduce GHG emissions during construction include:

# Reduce quantity of materials used
# Select materials with low emissions factors associated (e.g., recycled materials)
# Select materials suppliers as close as possible from the const
# Divert demolition wastes to recycling instead of landfills or incineration

===Operation===
GHG emissions associated with buildings operation are mainly coming from:

# Electricity consumption
# Consumption of fossil fuels on-site for the production of electricity, hot water, heat, etc.
# On-site waste water treatment
# On-site solid wastes treatment
# Industrial processes housed in the buildings

Fossil fuels include natural gas and propane.

Depending on the region where the building is located and the building energy mix, operation emissions can vary from 0 to over 100 kgCO2e/m2 per year.

LCB usually achieve less than 10 kgCO2e/m2 per year.

Strategies adopted by LCB to reduce GHG emissions during operation include:

# Reduce energy consumption
# Switch to renewable energy sources

Renewable energy sources include:

# Solar
# Wind
# Low-impact hydro
# Biofuels (under certain conditions)
# Geothermal
# Wave and tidal

==Indirect GHG reductions==
There are three main sources of indirect GHG reductions available for buildings:

# Green power
# Carbon offsets
# GHG reductions from the selling to the grid of clean electricity produced on-site

These GHG reductions can be used by building owners to offset the emissions which can not be reduced otherwise or to achieve specific GHG target, for example “carbon neutrality”.

Note: building emissions should always be reported in GHG inventories prior to and independent of any indirect GHG reductions. GHG emissions trades should be reported separately in a different section of GHG inventories.

For this reason, it is recommended to reduce buildings emissions by adopting the strategies listed in previous paragraphs rather than using GHG emissions trades.

==Low-carbon buildings today==
LCB, as part of “green buildings”, are developing very rapidly. Recent examples include:

* Aldo Leopold Foundation Headquarters, Fairfield (USA)
* Kroon Hall, Yale University’s School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies (USA)
* Sustainable Energy Technology Center, The University of Nottingham, NingBo (China)
* Mud Decisions, Bangalore (India)

&lt;small&gt;*By failing to provide the ticket book to the complainant in [[braille]], the respondent unlawfully discriminated against the complainant in breach of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;small&gt;*(Given practical difficulties in retrospectively providing the ticket book) ... that the respondent conference with the complainant and provide direct and individual assistance in applying for remaining tickets.&lt;/small&gt;
}}

'''''Maguire v SOCOG 1999''''' was a decision of the [[Australia]]n [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]], which ruled on 18 October 1999 that a [[blindness|blind]] man had been directly discriminated against by the failure of a government agency to provide ticketing materials for the [[Sydney Olympic Games]] in [[braille]].

The Commission held it was not reasonable for the agency to rely on alternatives such as telephone information lines or an assumption the respondent could have the materials read to him by another. The Commission also held that the cost of providing materials in braille should be considered in the context of an agency's overall budget rather than an assessed cost-benefit of the number of potential users of that material.

==Background to the case==
Bruce Lindsay Maguire (b 1957) a small business owner from [[Baulkham Hills, New South Wales]], was born totally blind and without sight or light perception. On 31 May 1999 Maguire sought to purchase tickets for himself and his family for the [[Sydney Olympic Games]]. At the time tickets were only available via an application form in a ticket book issued by the [[Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games]] (SOCOG).

Maguire initially tried to have the ticket book read aloud to him by his sister, but the level of detail and cross-referencing required in this process was onerous and the attempt was abandoned after several hours. Maguire then enquired about obtaining a braille version of the ticket book. SOCOG indicated a braille version would be published but this did not occur. On 7 June 1999 Maguire was contacted by SOCOG to advise that the book would not be printed in braille as the cost was considered too high given the likely small number of braille-literate users.&lt;ref name=maguire1999&gt;[http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/1999/DD000150.htm], Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Website,   17 December 2007,   Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 4pm EST, "http://www.humanrights.gov.au/disability_rights/decisions/comdec/1999/DD000150.htm".&lt;/ref&gt;

Maguire then lodged a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, alleging direct discrimination against him personally, and indirect discrimination against those with vision impairment. The specific grounds for the complaint were: 
* failure to provide braille copies of the information required to place orders for Olympic Games tickets;
* failure to provide braille copies of the Olympic Games souvenir programme; and
* failure to provide a web site accessible to Maguire.

In September 1999 this third ground for complaint was separated from the others and formed the basis for the standalone decision in ''[[Maguire v SOCOG 2000]]''

Prior to the matter being heard, SOCOG instituted a telephone helpline for ticketing enquiries by the visually impaired.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;

==Arguments==

===Jurisdiction of HREOC===
SOCOG initially objected to the Commission hearing the complaint on jurisdictional grounds. SOCOG argued it was a government agency and not a trading corporation and therefore not captured by section 12 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. Instead, SOCOG argued the complaint should be heard by State disability tribunals.

On 24 September 1999 SOCOG withdrew its objection to the complaint being heard but indicated it may renew it should the matter proceed to the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]. Commissioner William Carter maintained the Commission was competent to hear the complaint but was not required to formally rule on the objection as it was withdrawn prior to hearing.

===Direct discrimination===
In failing to provide the ticket book in braille, the Commissioner found that SOCOG breached section 24 of the Act.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s24&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s24.html ], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 24 Goods, services and facilities, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:43pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s24.html&lt;/ref&gt; SOCOG argued that the delivery of the information in the ticket book did not constitute the provision of services within the meaning
of section 24.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s24/&gt; The Commissioner did not accept that argument as the services provided by SOCOG fell inside the definition stated in section 4,&lt;ref name=dda1992s4&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s4.html ], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 4 Interpretation, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:48pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s4.html .&lt;/ref&gt; in which SOCOG was providing tickets to sessions at the 2000 Olympics where SOCOG cannot refuse as the terms of conditions for the tickets was the same for Maguire as for any sighted person and that the ticketing process was integral to gaining a ticket to attend and to enjoy the entertainment provided by SOCOG.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt; In providing  the ticket book in print and not in braille meant that Maguire was denied access to the ticket book, the consequential services provided by SOCOG and accordingly, Maguire was denied the opportunity to make a valid application for tickets to the Olympic games.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;

===Less favourable treatment===
The commissioner felt that unless Maguire could have access to the information in order to make a valid application, he was treated less favourably because of his blindness than a sighted person.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt; SOCOG contested the charge of less favourable treatment by outlining that Maguire could have got a sighted person to read the document for him, and that Maguire had access to a phone helpline and to an electronic format of the booklet.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt; The commissioner dismissed those arguments.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt; Reading the booklet to Maguire would have meant an incomprehensible oral presentation of tabulations, a great feat of memory, a requirement to find a time of convenience and  hours  of explanations was considered by the commissioner to be treating Maguire less favourably than the sighted person who could access the material without assistance at his or her leisure, capable of referencing and cross-referencing from page to page and thereby ensuring the completion not only of a valid application complete with alternatives that reflected in all respect the final decided choices of That person.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt; The commission raises the question as to how a person in the position of Maguire could acquire any primary information in the ticket book which could then be perfected or developed by the officer in the course of a telephone conversation.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt; The dilemma indicated by the commissioner was that if the ticket book was produced in braille, Maguire would have not required the assistance of the helpline.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt; The vital information in the ticket book was presented in tabular form in which the line of information scrolled off the right-hand edge of the screen, making it difficult for Maguire to comprehend when the material was presented in Braille form on the refreshable braille pad.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;

===Unjustifiable hardship===
SOCOG argued that the provision of the ticket book in braille was an unjustifiable hardship under section 24 (2).&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s24/&gt; Using Section 24 &lt;ref name=dda1992s24/&gt; and section 11 of DDA 1992,&lt;ref name=dda1992s11&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s11.html], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 11 Unjustifiable hardship, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 6:43pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s11.html.&lt;/ref&gt; the commissioner found  that despite the small proportion of blind persons in the community who use Braille, SOCOG had the financial capacity to bear the additional cost as the cost of 200 braille copies of the ticket book would be  $17,250.00 in comparison to the ticket book printing and distribution expenditure noted in SOCOG's budget which was $7.18 million.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;

===Indirect discrimination===
The commissioner found that SOCOG in not providing the ticket book in braille treated Maguire less favourably than persons without the disability which is also a breach of section 6.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=dda1992s6&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s6.html], DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ACT 1992 - SECT 6 Indirect disability discrimination, 25 August 2008, Australasian Legal Information Institute, last visited on Friday 29 August 2008, 8:35pm, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/dda1992264/s6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
After  finding in favour of Maguire, under section 103(1)(b)(ii) of the act, the commissioner made a declaration that SOCOG provide to Maguire forthwith the second booklet and that prior to
8 October,  that SOCOG consult and inform Maguire as best it can of the classes and sessions for which tickets remain available and assist him in making a valid application for the remaining tickets by 8 October 1999.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt; Consequently, the commissioner made a further declaration that, if Maguire desire to engage in the final ticketing process and SOCOG is unable to
provide Maguire with the third booklet in Braille by 23 October, SOCOG again consult with Maguire and inform and assist him in the same manner as described in the second declaration above.&lt;ref name=maguire1999/&gt;

'''No Berlusconi Day''' was a spontaneous mass political event organised by the [[Purple people]] and held worldwide on December 5, 2009. The protest was organized almost entirely through the [[Internet]]. The supporters were also known as ''Onda Viola'' ("Purple Wave"), because of the color chosen to distinguish the event, and widely used by all of the participants.

==Background==
The main idea behind the event was to show protest and dissatisfaction against [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s public image. Berlusconi, [[Italian Prime Minister]] at the time, was involved in a consistent amount of sex scandals, brought to court for financial crimes, and accused by many mobbers to be involved with the mafia organizations{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

==Organization==
On October 6, 2009 the so-called "[[lodo Alfano]]", one of Berlusconi's "ad personam" laws, was sentenced to be against Italy's Constitutional principles of equality by the Constitutional Court. A small group of bloggers started to comment on the sentence through internet's social networks, and later proposed a public protest against Silvio Berlusconi{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

The proposal was successful, and spread across [[social networks]]: in less than a week the "No Berlusconi Day" page reached over 20,000 members. The project was joined by people from all over Italy; local groups were created and people started to get organized.

In late October an official date was decided, December the 5th, and the main venue was to be [[Rome]].

People from all over the country and all over the world kept joining in, and by early November registered supporters had boomed to 200,000.

==The event==
The No Berlusconi Day started on December 5, at 4:00 am, Rome time schedule, when the No Berlusconi Day group from [[Sydney]] gathered. The events kept going on for the whole day, since No Berlusconi Day demonstrations took place all over the world: [[Berlin]], [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Madrid]], [[New York City]] and even [[Beijing]].

The main group of supported was planned to round up in Rome.

The program was respected almost flawlessly. The participants met in Piazza della Repubblica and started marching at 14:00, towards piazza S. Giovanni; they passed through via Cavour, piazza S. Maria Maggiore and via Merulana. The main stage was built in Piazza San Giovanni, and the first speaker started his speech at 16:30. Many others contributions followed until 18:30, when the veteran songwriter [[Roberto Vecchioni]] buckled the day with a 30' concert.

==Notable supporters==
Many prominent public figures supported the No Berlusconi Day; among them were: [[Antonio Di Pietro]], [[Walter Veltroni]], [[Nanni Moretti]], [[Daniele Luttazzi]], [[Paolo Flores d'Arcais]], [[Beppe Grillo]], [[Dario Fo]], [[Dacia Maraini]], [[Margherita Hack]], [[Piero Ricca]], [[Sabina Guzzanti]], [[Roberto Vecchioni]], [[Moni Ovadia]], [[Salvatore Borsellino]], [[Piergiorgio Odifreddi]], [[Vincenzo Vita]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noberlusconiday.org/?page_id=80 People who have supported the project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage and Parties' attention==
The event immediately attracted the media's attention, and members of the No Berlusconi-day staff appeared in TV news and were interviewed by major Italian newspapers. Most of them were ordinary people, rather unheard of by the greater public, but sometimes popular in the bloggers' community.

This people's uproar forced the main opposition party - the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|PD]]- to declare his position as far as supporting the No Berlusconi Day. The PD Secretary, [[Pierluigi Bersani]], anyway remained somehow ambiguous, thus creating much disillusion in the Party's supporters and staff.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

If a [[defendant]] in England and Wales is identified as being vulnerable, special measures can be taken to allow a non-registered intermediary to assist them during their trial. Around two thirds of all offenders have communication difficulties &lt;ref&gt;Professor Karen Bryan: Sheffield Hallam University IJLCD Winter Lecture,: Language Difficulties and Criminal Justice Processes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYFd3J6z_vI&amp;sns=tw&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a high demand for non-registered intermediaries in the criminal courts.
The first practical use of a defendant intermediary in a major trial is believed to be a murder case before a high court judge.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Lawrence - Gillian Frost: The use of Intermediaries (2012) http://www.communicourt.co.uk/gillian-frost-the-use-of-intermediaries/&lt;/ref&gt; If an intermediary is to be used the court should then attempt to find an appropriate intermediary. HMCTS staff have been issued with guidance which includes the list of several professional organisations that may be able to assist in providing an intermediary.&lt;ref&gt;R v GP - In the Crown Court at Leeds: T2012 0409 http://www.communicourt.co.uk/r-v-gp/&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest providers of intermediaries for defendants in the criminal and family courts are [[Communicourt Ltd|Communicourt]] [http://www.communicourt.co.uk/services/] and Triangle [http://www.triangle.org.uk/what-we-do/intermediaries]

Intermediaries carry out a range of functions to assist the courts and criminal justice practitioners including:

* Carrying out a detailed and specialist assessment of the defendant's communication skills
* Preparation of a report providing advice, guidance and information to the courts and criminal justice practitioners on how to Achieve Best Evidence from the defendant, including what types of questions to avoid, how long the defendant will need to process and answer a question and when they will need breaks
* Helping a defendant to follow the course of a trial and the case against him/her
* Assisting criminal justice practitioners to rephrase questions the defendant does not understand (without changing the substantive meaning) and communicating their answers to the court

== The Difference Between Registered and Non-Registered Intermediaries ==
The Youth Justice &amp; Criminal Evidence Act 1999 created the provision for a range of "Special Measures" for cases involving vulnerable and intimidated witnesses to give their best evidence in court, one of which is the intermediary special measure.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of Intermediaries: AAC SIG 12 June 2008, slide 3 www.aacsig.org.uk/sites/default/files/.../the-role-of-the-intermediaries.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; The Witness Intermediary Scheme (WIS) was set up by the Ministry of Justice’s Better Trials Unit to implement the intermediary special measure. The [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] operate and manage the WIS’s national database and matching service on behalf of the Ministry of Justice. Intermediaries appointed through the WIS will be [[Registered Intermediary]], recruited, trained and accredited by the Ministry of Justice. RIs work through the Witness Intermediary Scheme, run by the Ministry of Justice, which maintains a register of intermediaries, providing training and matching them with witnesses or victims. The legislation currently excludes defendants from using RIs. Instead they have to rely on what the High Court called ‘private and unregulated’ helpers &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/high-court-rules-vulnerable-defendants-deserve-equal-protection/5041833.fullarticle&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerable defendants frequently stand trial without the professional assistance they require. Defendants do not have access to the MoJ "Registered Intermediaries" but should still have access to high quality intermediaries with skills not only in assisting with evidence giving, but also in  helping the defendant to understand the case against him/her, instruct his legal team, and participate in the trial.

== Ground Rules Hearing ==

In preparation for trial, courts must take ‘every reasonable step’ to facilitate the participation of witnesses and defendants. One such step is the ground rules hearing:&lt;ref&gt;The Advocates Gateway - Ground Rules Hearings: Planning to question a vulnerable person or someone with communication needs Toolkit 1(c) 21 October 2013 http://www.theadvocatesgateway.org/images/toolkits/1cGroundrules211013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A pre-trial meeting of the trial judge, trial advocates and intermediary with the aim of deciding how someone who has communication needs or is otherwise vulnerable should be enabled to give their best evidence, or how a vulnerable defendant can participate effectively in the trial. 'Ground rules' for questioning must be discussed between the court, the advocates and the intermediary before giving evidence.&lt;ref&gt;The Advocates Gateway: Responding to communication needs in the justice system http://www.theadvocatesgateway.org/intermediaries&lt;/ref&gt; GRHs are a form of case management hearing and discussion of ground rules is required in all intermediary trials. Intermediaries indicated&lt;ref&gt;Highs and Lows: The 4th Intermediary Survey, Penny Cooper: Kingston University London July 2014 (updated 13 October 2014) http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/28868/1/Cooper_P-28868.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the most important matters which needed to be discussed at a GRH:

i. The recommendations in the intermediary report/ going through the questioning recommendations

ii. When, and how often, breaks should occur (for the vulnerable person)

iii. How and when the intermediary should intervene / get the judge’s attention if there is a communication issue

iv. How to introduce and use communication aids

v. Strategies to keep the vulnerable person calm and engaged

vi. The role of the intermediary

vii. The relevant materials from [http://www.theadvocatesgateway.org/ The Advocates Gateway]

viii. When the vulnerable person will practice with the video link (if used)

ix. When the judge and counsel will meet the vulnerable witness

x. The need for flexibility e.g. to have another GRH if the situation changes

== Intermediaries in Family Cases ==
The family courts are now more familiar in recent times with the concept of an intermediary being involved in cases where an individual may have [[learning disability#Learning Disabilities|Learning Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;Case No: B4/2013/2048 &amp; B4/2014/0198 Neutral Citation Number: [2014] EWCA Civ 128 IN THE COURT OF APPEAL (CIVIL DIVISION) ON APPEAL FROM THE HIGH COURT FAMILY DIVISION Re C (A Child) [2014] EWCA Civ 128&lt;/ref&gt; In family cases, most intermediaries will be operating outside the WIS and in these circumstances they will be non-registered intermediaries. The intermediary should be matched according to their communication specialism, their availability and, if possible, their geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;The Advocate's Gateway: Vulnerable Witnesses and Parties in the Family Courts Toolkit 13, 8/11/2014 http://www.familylaw.co.uk/system/redactor_assets/documents/2029/13vulnerablewitnessesandpartiesinthefamilycourts081114.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Funding must be agreed on a case-by-case basis as there is no standard procedure in [[Family proceedings court|Family Courts]]. Sometimes the cost of the intermediary is shared by the [[Legal Aid Agency#LAA|LAA]], the court and the local authority. Sometimes it is funded solely by the court. Some intermediaries have reported a lack of clarity amongst practitioners about the role of the intermediary in family cases.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 2014: ‘Speaking when they are spoken to: hearing vulnerable witnesses in care proceedings’ CFLQ 26(2):132–51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the matter of D (A Child) [2014] EWFC 39 &lt;ref&gt;In the Family Court at Swindon, In the Matter of D (A Child) https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/re-child-d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the President noted: ‘The mother and the father may require the use of an intermediary, not merely in the court setting but also, for example, when meeting professionals out of court'. Furthermore, with reference to the matter of A (A Child) [2013] EWHC 3502 &lt;ref&gt;In the High Court of Justice Family Division Neutral Citation Number: [2013] EWHC 3502 (Fam) Case No: UW11C00045 http://www.familylawweek.co.uk/site.aspx?i=ed123147&lt;/ref&gt; the legal representatives should normally by the date of the case management hearing identify an agency to assist their client to give evidence through an intermediary or otherwise if the court concludes that such measures are required.&lt;ref&gt;Re C (A Child) [2014] EWCA Civ 128 Case No: B4/2013/2048 &amp; B4/2014/0198 Neutral Citation Number: [2014] EWCA Civ 128 IN THE COURT OF APPEAL (CIVIL DIVISION) ON APPEAL FROM THE HIGH COURT FAMILY DIVISION (HIS HONOUR JUDGE TURNER QC) paragraph 25&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communicourt Code of Practice for NRI's&lt;ref&gt;Communicourt Code of Practice http://www.communicourt.co.uk/resources/code-of-practice/&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The primary responsibility of the Non-Registered Intermediary is to enable complete, coherent and accurate communication to take place between a defendant who requires special measures and the court

Non-Registered Intermediaries must have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the responsibilities and duties of their role within the criminal justice system, including their primary responsibility to the court

They must conduct themselves in court in a manner that facilitates accurate and coherent communication between the defendant and the court

They  must respect at all times the authority and judgement of the court

The Nutritional Health Alliance was formed in 1992 by the [[supplement industry]] "to mount a forceful campaign to evade studies of their products."  [[Gerald Kessler]], president of Nature's Plus, was the first head. Flyers were sent to health food stores with such titles as "The FDA wants to put you out of Business" and "Don't Let the FDA Take Your Vitamins Away" &lt;ref name = "food"&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nutritional Health Alliance is best known for its involvement in the ''Nutritional Health Alliance vs. Shalala'' case.  In this case Nutritional Health Alliance argued to the second circuit that the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) mandating health claims on dietary supplements violated manufacturer's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref name = "Advertising"&gt;{{cite book

OMEGA is owned by [[United Kingdom|British]]-owned conglomerate [[Spectris|Spectris plc]].&lt;ref name="Reuters OMEGA is bought"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Telegraph OMEGA Acquisition"/&gt; since 2011.

==History==
The company was founded in 1962 by Betty Hollander at her kitchen table while she was raising 4 kids.&lt;ref name="Senator Lieberman Praising Betty Hollander"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/stamfordadvocate/obituary.aspx?n=betty-ruth-hollander&amp;pid=150114577 Betty Ruth Hollander (obituary)], Apr. 9, 2011, Stamford Advocate&lt;/ref&gt; OMEGA began as a [[thermocouple]] manufacturer but slowly transitioned to other types of instrumentation. Today, OMEGA manufactures and sells devices that measure everything from temperature to pH.&lt;ref name="OMEGA homepage"&gt;{{cite web|title=OMEGA Website Homepage|url=http://www.omega.com/|website=omega.com|publisher=Omega Engineering|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hacking===
In 1996, Tim Lloyd, an 11-year employee of OMEGA and a network administrator within the company, was fired. Three weeks after he was fired,&lt;ref name="Firing of Tim Lloyd"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gaudin |first1=Sharon |title=The Omega files: A true story |url=http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/06/27/omega.files.idg/ |accessdate=October 2, 2018 |publisher=CNN |date=June 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; he unleashed a hacking "time bomb" within OMEGA's computer systems, deleting the software that ran all of OMEGA's manufacturing operations at its factory in [[Bridgeport, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Craig Chamberlain on Tim lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS on Tim Lloyd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Hacks|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hackers/whoare/notable.html|website=pbs.org|publisher=Public Broadcasting Station|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times on Tim Lloyd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strunsky|first1=Steve|title=Prison Sentence in Computer Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/27/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-jersey-newark-prison-sentence-in-computer-case.html|accessdate=13 September 2014|publisher=New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMEGA spent nearly $2 million repairing the programs and lost nearly $10 million in revenue, resulting in 80 employee layoffs, though Lloyd's lawyer stated that OMEGA's losses were far smaller.&lt;ref name="Craig Chamberlain on Tim lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS on Tim Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times on Tim Lloyd"/&gt; Tim Lloyd was later convicted of computer sabotage and was sentenced to 41 months in Federal prison.&lt;ref name="New York Times on Tim Lloyd"/&gt; The Tim Lloyd hacking case is considered one of the largest employee sabotage cases in United States history.&lt;ref name="PBS on Tim Lloyd"/&gt; The case also aired in a ''[[Forensic Files]]'' episode "Hack Attack", episode 39 of season 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_Files_(season_8) |title=Forensic Files Season 8 |accessdate=2018-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sale to Spectris==
In April, 2011, Betty Hollander died, and the company was turned over to her husband Milton Hollander.&lt;ref name="Senator Lieberman Praising Betty Hollander"/&gt; Later that year, Milton Hollander sold OMEGA Engineering to British-based [[Spectris|Spectris plc]] for $475 million.&lt;ref name="Reuters OMEGA is bought"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Telegraph OMEGA Acquisition"/&gt; Then, in March 2017, Spectris was forced to recognize an impairment charge of £115 million with relation to the past acquisition. This charge decreased [[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] and other [[intangible asset]]s on Spectris' [[balance sheet]]. The charge also decreased its 2016 [[net income]].&lt;ref name="goodwill writeoff"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baba|first1=Razak Musah|title=Spectris 2016 profit falls; but hikes dividend|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spectris-2016-profit-falls-but-hikes-dividend-2017-02-14|accessdate=January 3, 2018|publisher=MarketWatch|date=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parallel import''' is a non-[[counterfeit]] [[good (accounting)|product]] imported from another country without the permission of the [[intellectual property]] owner. Parallel imports are often referred to as [[grey market|grey product]] and are implicated in issues of [[international trade]], and [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/parallel_imports_e.htm|title=WTO - Glossary - parallel imports|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel importing is based on concept of [[exhaustion of intellectual property rights]]: according to this concept, when the product is first launched on the market in a particular jurisdiction, parallel importation is authorized to all residents in the state in question. Some countries allow it but others do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Pages/ParallelImportsGrayMarket.aspx|title=Parallel Imports/Gray Market|website=www.inta.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel importing of pharmaceuticals reduces price of pharmaceuticals by introducing competition; [[TRIPS agreement]] in Article 6 states that this practice cannot be challenged under the WTO dispute settlement system and so is effectively a matter of national discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/factsheet_pharm02_e.htm|title=WTO - Intellectual property (TRIPS) - fact sheet - pharmaceuticals - 2|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of parallel importing is often advocated in the case of software, music, printed texts and electronic products, and occurs for several reasons:

# Different versions of a product are produced for sale in different markets: the UK edition of [[Top Gear Magazine]] is officially sold in the UK, and [[Top Gear Australia (magazine)|Top Gear Australia]] is officially sold in Australia. However some unofficial distributors in [[Australia]] also sell the UK edition of Top Gear Magazine.
# Companies, either the manufacturer or the distributor, set different [[price points]] for their products in different markets. Parallel importers ordinarily purchase products in one country at a price (P1) which is cheaper than the price at which they are sold in a second country (P2), import the products into the second country, and benefitting from [[arbitrage]], sell the products in that country at a price which is usually between P1 and P2.
# Consumers who are able to obtain more competitively priced items and may be able to avoid local sales taxes, are placed on an even footing with consumers who have less access to overseas sales online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Question ANswered |url=https://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |accessdate=16 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515131714/http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some advocacy groups support parallel importing on the grounds of enhancing the free flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825182748/http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |archivedate=25 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International approach==
Parallel importing is regulated differently in different jurisdictions; there is no consistency in laws dealing with parallel imports between countries. Neither the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] nor the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] explicitly prohibit parallel importation.

===Australia===
The Australian market is an example of a relatively small consumer market which does not benefit from the economies of scale and competition available in the larger global economies. Australia tends to have lower levels of competition in many industries and oligopolies are common in industries like banking, supermarkets, and mobile telecommunications.

Private Enterprise will use product segmentation strategies to legally maximise profit. This often includes varying the service levels, pricing and product features to improve so called "fit" to the local marketplace. However this segmentation may mean an identical products at often higher prices. This can be termed "Price Discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winning entry for the Kirby Cup 2012 {{!}} Saving the right to parallel import in a digital world|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/winning-entry-kirby-cup-2012-saving-right-parallel-import-digital-world |date=22 Nov 2012 |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the Internet, Australian consumers can readily compare prices globally and have been able to identify products exhibiting Price Discrimination, also known as the "[[Australia Tax]]".

In 1991, the Australian Government resolved to remove parallel import restrictions from a range of products except cars. It followed this up with legislation making it legal to source music and software CDs from overseas and import them into Australia. An Australian Productivity Commission report recommended in July 2009 that legislation be extended to legalise the parallel importing of books, with three years' notice for publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Andrew|title=Australia: Productivity Commission Recommends Removal Of Parallel Import Protection For Books|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/article.asp?articleid=83242|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission also recommended abolishing restrictions on parallel importing of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charlwood|first1=Sam|title=Cheaper second-hand imported cars a step closer|url=http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/cheaper-secondhand-imported-cars-a-step-closer-20140214-32prt.html|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Court of Australia [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/130.html decision] shows that parallel imported items with valid trademark are subject to [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/s123.html Section 123 of the Trade Mark Act].

Various Parliament of Australia committees have investigated allegations of Price Discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Representatives Committees|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=ic/itpricing/subs.htm|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union/European Economic Area===
The [[European Union]] (and [[European Economic Area]]) requires the doctrine of international exhaustion to exist between member states (contracting states) but EU legislation for trade marks, design rights and copyright prohibits its application to goods put on the market outside the EU/EEA.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] has held that the [[exhaustion of rights|doctrine of international exhaustion]] governs parallel importation, subject to the EU rules above.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, parallel importation is permitted under both, the [[Trade Mark]] and (amended) [[Copyright]] Ordinance before The Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 came into force 6 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/071212/html/071212en08002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214013629/http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/071212/html/071212en08002.htm |archivedate=14 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Seven arrested for copyright infringement&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]]'s intellectual property rights law prohibits audiovisual articles marketed for export from being sold domestically, and such sale of "re-imported" CDs are illegal.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], legal precedent has established that parallel importation is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/135.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]], the US Supreme Court held that the [[first-sale doctrine]] applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad, thus permitting importation and resale of many product categories.

Moreover, Science, State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies, Appropriations Act of 2006 prohibits future FTAs from categorically disallowing the parallel import of patented products.&lt;ref&gt;Shayerah Ilias, Ian Fergusson, “Intellectual Property Rights and International Trade,” Congressional research Service, February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automobiles==
{{mainarticle|Grey import vehicle}}

===United States===
The United States has unique automobile design legislation administered by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. Certain car makers find the required modifications too expensive. This creates demand for [[grey import vehicles]], where certain models are modified for individual customers to meet these requirements, at a higher expense than if this were done by the original manufacturer on an [[assembly line]]. This procedure interferes with the marketing scheme of the manufacturer, who might plan to import a less powerful car and force consumers to accept it. The Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988 basically ended the gray market by requiring manufacturer certification of  U.S.-bound cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Aaron|title=How To: Win the Car-Importing Game|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/how-to-win-the-car-importing-game/|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel-imported foodstuffs, etc.==
Markets for parallel imports and locally made products sometimes exist alongside each other even though the parallel imports are markedly more expensive. This may be for various reasons, but is mostly observed in foodstuffs and toiletry.

Due to the nature of hotels, travellers often have little information on where to shop except in the immediate vicinity. Grocery shops opened to serve brand-name hotels often feature parallel-imported foodstuffs and toiletry to cater to travellers so that they can easily recognise the product they have been using at home.

Foodstuffs and toiletry made from different plants may vary in quality because different plants may use materials or reagents (such as water used for washing, food additives) from different sources, although they are usually subject to the same standards by internal QC or public health authorities. A person may be allergic to the foodstuff or toiletry made by some plants but not others.

To sum up, the major reasons for such a market are:

* Lack of information
* Recognisability
* Avoidance of risk due to products by different plants
&lt;!--Appreciated if someone could improve clarity--&gt;

==Issues==
A manifestation of the philosophical divide between those who support various intellectual property and [[Criticism of intellectual property|those who are critical of it]], is the divide over the legitimacy of parallel importation. Some believe that it benefits consumers by lowering prices and widening the selection and consumption of products available in the [[Market (economics)|market]], while others believe that it discourages intellectual property owners from investing in new and [[innovation|innovative]] products. Some also believe that parallel imports tend to facilitate [[copyright infringement]].

This tension essentially concerns the [[rights]] and [[duty|duties]] of a protected [[monopoly]]. Intellectual property rights allow the holder to sell at a price that is higher than the price one would pay in a [[competition|competitive market]], but by doing so the holder relinquishes sales to those who would be prepared to buy at a price between the monopoly price and the competitive price. The presence of parallel imports in the marketplace prevents the holder from exploiting the monopoly further by [[market segmentation]], i.e. by applying different prices to different consumers.

[[Consumer organisation]]s tend to support parallel importation as it offers consumers more choice and lower prices, provided that consumers retain equivalent legal protection to locally sourced products (e.g. in the form of [[warranty|warranties]] with international effect), and competition is not diminished.

However, such organisations also warn consumers of certain risks in using parallel-imported products. Although the products may have been made to comply with the laws and customs of their place of origin, these products or their use may not comply with those in places where they are used, or some of their functions may be rendered unusable or meaningless (which may needlessly drive up prices). Electronic devices, however, suffer less from this type of risk because newer models support more than one user language.

==Examples==

===Australia===
Importation of [[computer games]] and computer game hardware from [[Asia]] is a common practice for some wholesale and/or retail stockists. Many consumers now take advantage of on-line stores in [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United States]] to purchase computer games at or near half the cost of a retail purchase from the Australian RRP. Often the versions sold by the Asian retailers are manufactured in Australia to begin with. An example is [[Crysis]], which was available from Hong Kong on-line stores for approximately $50 AUD but whose retail cost in Australia was close to $100. Crysis was sold in Asia using identical versions of the game box and disc, right down to including Australian censor ratings on the box.

===Hong Kong===
{{See also|Parallel trading in Hong Kong}}
Importation of [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] [[toothpaste]] from [[Thailand]] into [[Hong Kong]]. The goods are bought in markets where the price is lower, and sold in markets where the price of the same goods is, for a variety of reasons, higher. Electronic goods like Apple's [[iPad]] are frequently imported in Hong Kong before they're official and resold to South-East Asian early adopters for a premium.

===New Zealand===
The practice exists of luxury [[automobile|car]] dealers in [[New Zealand]] buying [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[vehicle]]s in [[Malaysia]] at a low price, and importing the cars into New Zealand to sell at a price lower than the price offered by Mercedes Benz to New Zealand consumers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There are also many parallel import dealers of electronics hardware.

There is an opinion, not scientifically proven, but very popular among people in Poland that "Western" washing powders are more effective in cleaning than Polish, because chemistry companies allegedly produce items of higher quality for Western Europe, not as good as for Poland. Because of that, there are companies and online stores importing Western chemistry supplies to Poland (for example from Germany), even if similar brands are available there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luna24.pl/produkty/proszki-do-prania,2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pralinka.pl/Chemia-z-niemiec/niemiecki-proszek-do-prania/|title=Proszki do prania z Niemiec - niemiecka chemia pralinka.pl|first=Trol|last=InterMedia|website=www.pralinka.pl|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- according to the rg.ru article, external trade volume is 12 times that of internal trade --&gt;
According to [http://bablaw.livejournal.com/ Anatoliy Semyonov], trademark rights exhaustion turned national in 2002, and, as of April 2013, an act is being prepared that could make original goods imported without a permission of the producer officially "counterfeit" (by replacing things on which "a trademark is located illegally" with things "on which an illegally used trademark is located"). He notes that, according to the [[Criminal Code of Russia|Criminal Code]], illegal use of a trademark can be punished up to 6 years of imprisonment; and a similar article in the [[Offences Code of Russia|Offences Code]] makes goods with an illegal copy of a trademark subject to confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===European Union===
Some [[PlayStation Portable|Sony PSP]] video game consoles were imported into the [[European Economic Area]] from Japan up to twelve months prior to the European launch. The unusual component of this example is that some importers were selling the console for a higher price than the intended EU price, taking advantage of the relative monopoly they enjoyed. After the release the console was commonly imported from the USA where it was retailed for much lower price.

Other example are smart phones, which are being imported from China, where an average device can be bought for about $100 while a similar device would be retailed for about 200€ in the EU.

[[Spanish Navy#Current Rank structure|Rear Admiral]] '''Patricio Montojo y Pasarón''' (September 7, 1839 – September 30, 1917) was a career [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Spanish Navy|naval]] officer who commanded the restored [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]]'s Pacific Squadron based in [[the Philippines]] during the [[Spanish–American War]]. Considered to have been a man of high ability and experience, he was given what was regarded as an impossible task of defending the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|Spanish Philippines]] with antiquated ships and low supplies against the more formidable U.S. [[Asiatic Squadron]]. Montojo became known for his defeat at the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] (1 May 1898) by [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]], being a decisive naval battle of the war. After the conflict, the rear admiral was held accountable for the defeat and was court-martialed, but that was later overturned, though Montojo was still discharged from the Spanish Navy.

== Early life and career ==
Born in [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Montojo studied at the Naval School in the southern Spanish city of [[Cádiz]], and was assigned as a [[midshipman]] in 1855. By 1860, he had become a sub-lieutenant and fought against the [[Moros]] of [[Mindanao]] in the [[Philippines]] before returning to Spain in 1864. During his stay in the Philippines, the Spanish officer visited [[Qing Dynasty|China]] and the [[French Colonial Empire|French]] colony in southern [[Cochinchina|Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;Ponset, Joe. [http://www.spanamwar.com/montojo.htm Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasarón]. Spanish–American War Centennial website. Retrieved 14 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montojo fought in the [[Battle of Abtao]] and the [[Battle of El Callao]] under Admiral [[Casto Méndez Núñez]] against [[Peru]] and subsequently assumed a post at the Secretariat of the Admiralty. He was promoted to the rank of Commander in 1873. His new duties included commanding several warships at the [[Havana]] naval station as well as those in the [[Río de la Plata]]. Montojo remained in Madrid until November 1891, when he was promoted to the flag officer rank. In 1892 he became a candidate for the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] and in 1897 he received the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Spain#Obsolete|Military Order of María Cristina]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dyal"&gt;[[#Dyal1996|Dyal (1996)]], p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leeke55" /&gt;

== Service in the Philippines ==
[[File:Battle of Manila Bay by W. G. Wood.jpg|200px|thumb|left|A painting of the battle with Montojo's flagship, ''[[Spanish cruiser Reina Cristina|Reina Cristina]]'', in the foreground]]
By 1898, Montojo returned to the Philippines as rear admiral, serving as general commander of all Spanish Philippine naval stations and taking part in operations against Filipino insurgents.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; At a meeting with the colony's [[Governor-General of the Philippines|captain general]], [[Basilio Augustín]], on March 15, 1898, he expressed his concerns that their forces would be destroyed by the Americans in battle because of their disadvantages, as it became apparent that war with the United States was increasingly likely.&lt;ref name="dewey"&gt;[http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/ddg105/Pages/Namesake.aspx#.WZHkjoqQxCE George Dewey]. US Navy official website. Retrieved 14 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the thirty-seven ships in the Spanish naval fleet stationed in the Philippines, the majority were small gunboats, so there were only seven ships that would be used to take on the U.S. [[Asiatic Squadron]].&lt;ref name="dyal" /&gt; In addition, there were other problems facing the Spaniards. Their force did not possess enough adequate [[Naval mine|mines]], and some of the ones they did have were missing components. The admiral requested additional supplies from the homeland but these were ultimately not delivered.&lt;ref&gt;Poncet, Jose. [http://www.spanamwar.com/Spanishmines.htm Mines]. Spanish–American War Centennial website. Retrieved 14 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Montojo decided to send the squadron to [[Subic Bay|Subig Bay]] to the northwest of [[Manila]], which would be easier to defend for the Spanish when the American ships arrived. If they ignored them and headed for Manila, he believed his squadron could then head back and ambush the U.S. squadron at night.&lt;ref name="dewey" /&gt; 

However, by the time the Americans arrived and checked at [[Subic, Zambales|Subic]] on April 30, they found no Spanish ships there. That was because Montojo had judged the position to be indefensible because they had not finished installing the naval guns on the ground at the entrance to Subic, being behind schedule—though according to American scouts, the guns were lying on the beach and could have been mounted in less than 24 hours. In addition, the wooden cruiser {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Castilla||2}} was having technical problems. Thus a council of squadron captains decided to return to [[Manila Bay]]. Reportedly, another factor in Admiral Montojo's decision was that they would not be able to save Spanish sailors in the depth of forty meters of water at Subic, something which American naval officers found astounding. Thus the American squadron leader, Admiral [[George Dewey]], and his other officers initially had a low opinion of the Spanish commander's abilities.&lt;ref name="leeke55"&gt;[[#Leeke2009|Leeke (2009)]], pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wreck of protected cruiser Isla de Cuba.jpg|thumb|200px|The wreck of Montojo's second flagship, ''Isla de Cuba'']]
The American ships passed into Manila Bay without striking the few mines that the Spaniards had emplaced (the water was too deep and the waterway was too wide for them to be of much use), and aside from artillery fire from the guns on [[Corregidor]] island, did not meet much resistance. They entered the bay without any losses. Meanwhile, the Spanish ships were anchored at the naval arsenal near [[Cavite]], where Montojo—pessimistic about the battle—believed his men would have the best chance of survival.&lt;ref name="dewey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leeke2009|Leeke (2009)]], pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; The engagement that followed between the Spanish squadron and the Americans became the first major naval battle that Montojo had fought in for over thirty years.&lt;ref name="leeke48"&gt;[[#Leeke2009|Leeke (2009)]], pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; The US squadron arrived near Cavite and engaged the Spanish under Montojo on May 1, 1898, around 5:00 in the morning. By 5:40, despite the fire from the shore artillery and Montojo's squadron, none of the US ships had been damaged. The American squadron returned fire and Montojo's flagship, the cruiser {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Reina Cristina||2}}, sustained heavy damage along with the rest of the Spanish ships, forcing the admiral to move his flag to the {{ship|Spanish cruiser|Isla de Cuba||2}}. The captain of a British steamer that was passing by at the time noted that "[Montojo] stood upright in the stern perfectly unmoved, although splashes of water flew repeatedly over the little craft ... it was an example of unparalleled heroism."&lt;ref name="dewey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leeke2009|Leeke (2009)]], pp. 64–68&lt;/ref&gt;

By 7:30 in the morning, the Asiatic Squadron withdrew to restock their ammunition and provide rest for the crew. The only American casualties had been eight wounded aboard the {{USS|Baltimore|1861|6}} and one death on the {{USS|McCulloch|1897|6}}. After about three and a half hours, at around 11:15&amp;nbsp;a.m., the American ships returned to face the Spanish again. However, by then much of the Spanish squadron was destroyed and resistance was limited, and not long afterwards the Spaniards surrendered. Montojo reported around 381 casualties for his squadron in total, and among the wounded was one of his two sons.&lt;ref name="dewey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leeke2009|Leeke (2009)]], pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
After the defeat at Manila Bay, ''Contraalmirante'' Patricio Montojo y Pasarón was recalled to Madrid to be held as a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for the loss by the [[court-martial]] despite the circumstances that led to the defeat. He left Manila in October and arrived in November 1898. By decree of the court-martial, he was imprisoned in March 1899, but was later released. Among the testimony was Admiral George Dewey, to whom Montojo had sent a letter asking for assistance, and the American officer replied that "Although without accurate knowledge as to the condition of your ships, I have no hesitation in saying to you what I have already had the honor to report to my government, that your defense at Cavite was gallant in the extreme. The fighting of your flagship, which was singled out for attack, was especially worthy of a place in the traditions of valor of your nation." Montojo was later absolved of the charges but was still discharged from the [[Spanish Navy]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dyal" /&gt; In June 2017, a screenplay was written based on Montojo's court-martial and Admiral Dewey assisting him in March 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Posadas, Dennis.

Retrieved 14 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Madrid on September 30, 1917.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Montojo wrote a number of literary works and articles for various publications.&lt;ref name="dyal" /&gt; Among those was ''León Aldao'', ''A Critical Essay on the First Lands Discovered by Columbus'', and ''Encyclopedic Nautical Handbook'', as well as translations of [[Angelo Secchi]]'s book on physics and ''[[The Two Admirals]]'' by [[James Fenimore Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;Poncet, Jose.

'''Perpetual copyright''' can refer to a [[copyright]] without a finite [[copyright term|term]], or to a copyright whose finite term is perpetually extended.  Perpetual copyright in the former sense is highly uncommon, as the current laws of all countries with copyright statutes set a standard limit on the duration, based either on the date of creation/publication, or on the date of the creator's death.  (See [[List of countries' copyright lengths]].)  Exceptions have sometimes been made, however, for unpublished works. Usually, special legislation is required, granting a perpetual copyright to a specific work. 

In many countries, [[moral rights]], which may be covered under the copyright law, can last perpetually.

== Copyright philosophy ==
The basic philosophical argument employed by proponents of perpetual copyright presupposes that [[intellectual property]] ownership rights are analogous to other property rights such as those associated with material goods.  Proponents such as [[Samuel Clemens]]&lt;ref&gt;"Remarks of Samuel Langhorne Clemens Before the Congressional Joint Committee on Patents (December 1906)."  Quoted in LaForge, William N. (2010).  ''Testifying Before Congress.'' p. 199. TheCapitol.Net. {{ISBN|9781587331725}}.  Clemens stated in testimony before Congress, "So if I could have convinced that gentleman that a book which does consist solely of ideas, from the base to the summit, then that would have been the best argument in the world that it is property, like any other property, and should not be put under the ban of any restriction, but that it should be the property of that man and his heirs forever and ever, just as a butcher shop would be, or--I don't care--anything, I don't care what it is. It all has the same basis. The law should recognize the right of perpetuity in this and every other kind of property."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack Valenti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Patry| first = William |title = Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 110 | year = 2009| ISBN = 9780195385649}} Valenti stated before a congressional committee that "Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and protection resident in all other property owners in the nation."&lt;/ref&gt;  have stated that owners of intellectual property should have the same perpetual right to retain and bequeath this property to their descendants that owners of material goods already possess. [[Jonathan Zittrain]], a faculty co-director at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], illustrated this argument using the analogy:  "[It] makes no sense to imagine somebody after a certain time coming in and taking your rug or your chair and saying 'Sorry, your ownership expired.'"&lt;ref&gt;Wentworth, Donna. [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/mickey.htm "Mickey Rattles the Bars: the Supreme Court Hearing of Eldred v. Ashcroft"], [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], Harvard, 9 October 2002.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an op-ed published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', author [[Mark Helprin]] argues that it is unjust for a government to strip copyright holders of their exclusive rights after a set period of time.&lt;ref name = "Helprin"&gt;Helprin, Mark. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/opinion/20helprin.html?pagewanted=all "A Great Idea Lives Forever. Shouldn’t Its Copyright?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', New York, 20 May 2007.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also writes that copyright expiration transfers wealth from private copyright holders to corporations:

{{quote|"'Freeing' a literary work into the public domain is less a public benefit than a transfer of wealth from the families of American writers to the executives and stockholders of various businesses who will continue to profit from, for example, ''[[The Garden Party (short story collection)|The Garden Party]]'', while the descendants of [[Katherine Mansfield]] will not."&lt;ref name = "Helprin"/&gt;}}

Calls for perpetual copyright have been widely criticized.  [[Lawrence Lessig]] organized a community response to Helprin's editorial.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Lawrence.  [http://wiki.lessig.org/index.php/Against_perpetual_copyright "Against Perpetual Copyright"], The Lessig Wiki.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Public Knowledge]] issued a response which argued that copyright expiration ultimately provides a net benefit to society.&lt;ref name="Sherwin"&gt;Siy, Sherwin.  [http://www.publicknowledge.org/node/958 "Why Copyrights Must Expire: a reply to Mark Helprin"] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120107202004/http%3A//www.publicknowledge.org/node/958 |date=7 January 2012 }}, [[Public Knowledge]], 21 May 2007.  Retrieved on 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It distinguishes intellectual property rights from those associated with material goods; the latter "are scarce and rivalrous: [they] cannot be created anew, and only a limited number of people can occupy and use a space at any one time.  Copyrighted works are neither scarce nor rivalrous: books are created anew, by specific authors, and can be read by five million people as easily as by five dozen, depriving none of them, nor the author, of the ability to use the work."&lt;ref name = "Sherwin"/&gt;  Critics state that copyright expiration does not deprive a creator's heirs of the right to continue to appreciate and use the works of that creator as though a government had legally confiscated their physical possessions after a set period of time.   Society as a whole is granted the same right to appreciate and exploit the property that once was under the exclusive control of a single family or corporate entity.  This wider potential for the creative exploitation of works formerly under the exclusive control of a copyright owner promotes learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell QC, Iain G (2009) [http://www.ifosslr.org/ifosslr/article/view/23 'Back to the Future: Hinton v Donaldson, Wood and Meurose (Court of Session, Scotland, 28 July 1773)'], ''International Free and Open Source Software Law Review'', 1(2), 111 – 122.  The British judge Lord Kames wrote that "...if the monopoly of [book printing] was to be perpetual, it would be a sad case for learned men, and for the interest of learning in general: it would enhance the price of books far beyond the reach of ordinary readers."&lt;/ref&gt;  Public Knowledge and other critics wrote that existing [[copyright terms]] already provide more than sufficient compensation for creators of intellectual property. It has also been argued that copyright should not become a [[welfare]] system used to benefit remote descendants who happen to come into possession of a valuable copyright through the [[lottery of birth]], and that society is a "quite important heir" to copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Deven R., Copyright's Hidden Assumption: A Critical Analysis of the Foundations of Descendible Copyright (27 April 2009). Thomas Jefferson School of Law Research Paper No. 1353746. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1353746&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of perpetual copyright also point out that creative activity often involves the creation of [[derivative works]] that recast or build upon previous material.  If this prior material were perpetually copyrighted, their respective copyright holders would have the indefinite right to license their intellectual property or deny its use as they see fit.  Many new derivative works could not be produced if the interested parties were denied permission or could not afford the licensing fees.  Moreover, the longer copyright persists, the more copyrighted material falls into the category of [[orphan works]].&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Hal R., Copyright Term Extension and Orphan Works (December 2006). Industrial and Corporate Change, Vol. 15, Issue 6, pp. 965-980, 2006. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1116430 or {{doi|10.1093/icc/dtl026}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anyone seeking to create derivative works based upon orphan works faces the risk of copyright infringement if the copyright holders were to come forward at some later time to enforce their rights.  Perpetual copyright would create a significant disincentive to the creation of new literary or artistic works which build upon older material.

== Battle of the booksellers ==
When the statutory [[copyright term]] provided for by the [[Statute of Anne]], the first [[copyright]] statute, began to expire in 1731 London booksellers fought to defend their dominant position by seeking [[injunction]]s from the [[Court of Chancery]] for works by authors that fell outside the statute's protection. At the same time the London booksellers lobbied parliament to extend the copyright term provided by the Statute of Anne. Eventually, in a case known as ''Midwinter v. Hamilton'' (1743–1748), the London booksellers turned to [[common law]] and started a 30-year period known as the ''battle of the booksellers''. The battle of the booksellers saw London booksellers locking horns with the newly emerging Scottish book trade over the right to reprint works falling outside the protection of the Statute of Anne. The Scottish booksellers argued that no [[common law copyright]] existed in an author's work. The London booksellers argued that the Statute of Anne only supplemented and supported a pre-existing common law copyright. The dispute was argued out in a number of notable cases, including Millar v. Kincaid (1749–1751) and Tonson v. Collins (1761–1762).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 14| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A debate raged on whether printed ideas could be owned and London booksellers and other supporters of perpetual copyright argued that without it scholarship would cease to exist and that authors would have no incentive to continue creating works of enduring value if they could not inherit the property rights to their descendants. Opponents of perpetual copyright argued that it amounted to a [[monopoly]], which inflated the price of books, making them less affordable and therefore prevented the spread of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. London booksellers were attacked for using rights of authors to mask their greed and self-interest in controlling the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Van Horn Melton| first = James| title = The rise of the public in Enlightenment Europe| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001| pages =139| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-521-46969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Keen | first = Paul| title = Revolutions in Romantic literature: an anthology of print culture 1780-1832 | publisher = Broadview Press| year = 2004| pages =80| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qVBvcohS5v0C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-1-55111-352-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[Donaldson v Beckett]]'' reached the [[House of Lords]] in 1774 [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] was most strident in his rejection of the common law copyright, warning the Lords that should they vote in favour of common law copyright, effectively a perpetual copyright, "all our learning will be locked up in the hands of the Tonsons and the Lintots of the age". Moreover, he warned that booksellers would then set upon books whatever price they pleased "till the public became as much their slaves, as their own hackney compilers are". He declared that "Knowledge and science are not things to be bound in such cobweb chains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 19| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its ruling the House of Lords established that copyright was a "creature of statute", and that the rights and responsibilities in copyright were determined by legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Rimmer| first = Matthew| title = Digital copyright and the consumer revolution: hands off my iPod | publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing | year = 2007| pages = 4| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=1ONyncVruj8C&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright+scotland&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-948-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By confirming that the [[copyright term]] (that is the length of time a work is in copyright) did expire according to statute, the Lords also affirmed the [[public domain]]. The ''Donaldson v Beckett'' ruling confirmed that a large number of works and books first published in Britain were in the public domain, either because the copyright term granted by statute had expired, or because they were first published before the [[Statute of Anne]] was enacted in 1709. This opened the market for cheap reprints of works from [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], works now considered classics. The expansion of the public domain in books broke the dominance of the London booksellers and allowed for competition, with the number of London booksellers and publishers rising threefold from 111 to 308 between 1772 and 1802.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Van Horn Melton| first = James| title = The rise of the public in Enlightenment Europe| publisher = Cambridge University Press| year = 2001| pages =140–141| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QZovusQ1SjYC&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn =978-0-521-46969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, calls for perpetual copyright continued in Britain and France until the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Torremans| first = Paul| title = Copyright law: a handbook of contemporary research| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2007| pages = 154| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wHJBemWuPT4C&amp;dq=%22perpetual+copyright%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common law copyright ===
After ''Donaldson v Beckett'', disagreement continued over whether the House of Lords affirmed the existence of [[common law copyright]] before it was superseded by the Statute of Anne. The Lords had traditionally been hostile to the booksellers' monopoly and were aware of how the doctrine of [[common law copyright]], promoted by the booksellers, was used to support their case for a perpetual copyright. The Lords clearly voted against perpetual copyright,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Marshall| first = Lee| title = Bootlegging: romanticism and copyright in the music industry| publisher = Sage| year = 2006| pages = 15| url =https://www.google.com/books?id=25luX89BlA0C&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright+scotland&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-7619-4490-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually an understanding was established whereby authors had a pre-existing common law copyright over their work, but that with the Statute of Anne parliament had limited these natural rights in order to strike a more appropriate balance between the interests of the author and the wider social good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| pages = 24| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Patterson and Livingston there remains confusion about the nature of copyright ever since. Copyright has come to be viewed both as a natural law right of the author and as the statutory grant of a limited [[monopoly]]. One theory holds that copyright's origin occurs at the creation of a work, the other that its origin exists only through the copyright statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jonathan| first = Rosenoer| title = Cyberlaw: the law of the internet| publisher = Springer| year = 1997| pages = 34–35| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=HlG2esMIm7kC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-387-94832-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled in [[Wheaton v. Peters]], a case similar to the British [[Donaldson v Beckett]] of 1774, that although the author of an unpublished work had a [[common law copyright|common law right]] to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last = Yu| editor-first = Peter K.| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| pages = 143| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-275-98883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
The Copyright Act of 1775 established a type of perpetual copyright which allowed "the Two Universities in England, the Four Universities in Scotland, and the several colleges of Eton, Westminster, and Winchester to hold in Perpetuity their Copy Right in Books given to or bequeathed to the said Universities and Colleges for the advancement of useful learning and other purposes of education."&lt;ref&gt;Macgillivary, E.J. (1902). [https://archive.org/details/treatiseuponlawo00macguoft ''A Treatise Upon the Law of Copyright''], p.358.  John Murray. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence of this Act,{{fact|reason=Do we have a source that it is THIS Act?  The Wikipedia article on King James Version seems to have a slightly different narrative.|date=October 2018}} the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized or King James Version of the Bible]] was allowed to be printed only by the Royal printer and by the printers of the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. All provisions granting copyright in perpetuity were abolished by the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 but under transitional arrangements these printing rights do not fully expire until 2039.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48 |title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 |quote=Schedule 1, Section 13 (1): The rights conferred on universities and colleges by the Copyright Act 1775 shall continue to subsist until the end of the period of 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the new copyright provisions come into force and shall then expire.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. M. Barrie]]'s [[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]] (including the play ''Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up'' and its novelisation ''Peter and Wendy'') is covered by special legislation granting [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] a right to royalties in perpetuity from commercial exploitation of the story on stage, in publication, and in broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48|title=Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (c. 48, s. 301)|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]], [[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not a perpetual copyright because the hospital does not retain creative control over the work, which entered the public domain in the UK in 2008, 70 years after the author's death. This legislation does not apply to other works which feature Peter Pan such as ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' or ''[[Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens]]'', which are also in the public domain.

== United States ==

In the [[United States]], perpetual copyright is prohibited by its [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], which provides that copyright is "for limited times". However, it neither specifies how long that term can be, nor does it impose any restriction on the number of times the term may be extended. Indeed, since the enactment of the [[Copyright Act of 1790]], copyright term has been successively extended by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] on four occasions, retroactively extending the terms of any copyrights still in force.  Following the enactment of the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] in 1998, a coalition of plaintiffs led by publisher [[Eric Eldred]] argued that this act and a [[Copyright Act of 1976|previous extension of the copyright term]] in the 1970s had created a ''de facto'' "perpetual copyright on the installment plan".  This argument was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'', which held that there was no limit to how many times the term of copyright may be extended by Congress, so long as it is still a limited term at the time of each extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft|title=Eldred v. Ashcroft|year=2003|publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State law (United States)|State]] and [[common law]] have granted perpetual copyright in certain special cases not covered by federal copyright law.  Sound recordings made before 1972 are under the jurisdiction of state copyright laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Copyright Protection for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings | publisher=U.S. Copyright Office | date=28 December 2011 | url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/sound/ | accessdate=11 August 2012}} Changes made to federal law since 1972 ensure that it will ultimately supersede all statutes in state law governing sound recording copyrights: "Current law provides that pre-1972 sound recordings may remain protected under state law until February 15, 2067."&lt;/ref&gt; which provide perpetual protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harbeson |first=Eric |title=Comments submitted on behalf of The Music Library Association (MLA) | publisher=U.S. Copyright Office | date=31 January 2011 | url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/sound/comments/initial/20110131-Eric-Harbeson-Music-Library-Ass'n.pdf | accessdate=11 August 2012}} "Prior to the 1976 Copyright Act, pre-1972 sound recordings enjoyed a truly perpetual copyright term.  No state that we know of had enacted any limitation on the copyright term of sound recordings."&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 1 January 1978, when the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] came into effect, [[unpublished|unpublished works]] were protected by common law, which recognized perpetual copyright in these works for as long as they remained unpublished.&lt;ref name = "unpublished"&gt;{{cite web |title=Certain Unpublished, Unregistered Works Enter Public Domain | publisher=U.S. Copyright Office | date=13 January 2003 | url=http://www.copyright.gov/pr/pdomain.html | accessdate=11 August 2012}} "Under the 1909 Copyright Act, works that were neither published nor registered did not enjoy statutory protection, although they were protected under common law in perpetuity as long as they remained unpublished and unregistered."&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1976 Copyright Act exerted federal jurisdiction over unpublished works for the first time and all copyrights in these works were assigned a fixed term even if they remain unpublished.

== Singapore ==
Pursuant to Section 197 of the Copyright Act, unpublished governmental literary, dramatic and musical works are under perpetual copyright, but once published, they are copyrighted for 70 years following publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=2006-REVED-63&amp;doctitle=Copyright%20Act%0a&amp;segid=1138345608-006559#1138345608-006621|title=Copyright Act (c. 63, s. 197) - Provisions as to Government copyright|publisher=[[Attorney-General of Singapore|The Attorney-General’s Chambers]], [[Singapore]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13261">'''Pet rental''' is the practice, usually administered by for-profit companies, of [[renting]] [[pet]]s such as [[dog]] and [[cat]]s. Rental also includes animals who are [[hired]] out at a specific rate for a specific time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of RENT|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rent|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a controversial practice opposed by many [[animal rights]] advocates and has been banned in at least one municipality: [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallawcoalition.com/companion-animal-breeding/article/500] Animal Law Coalition&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of Pet Rental ==
=== Therapy Dogs ===
There are several methods of [[renting]] a [[therapy dog]] as a part of the Mayo Clinic's Caring Canines program&lt;ref&gt;"Therapy dogs can be a patient's best friend." ''Mayo Clinic'', Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and research, 19 Aug. 2016, https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/pet-therapy/art-20046342&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dogs]] that participate in this method of pet [[renting]] make regular visits to various [[hospital]] departments and can make special visits upon request.&lt;ref&gt;"Therapy dogs can be a patient's best friend." ''Mayo Clinic'', Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 19 Aug. 2016, https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/pet-therapy/art-20046342 &lt;/ref&gt; The dogs that participate in this program have been welcomed by the [[patients]] and are considered a good [[distraction]] from the [[atmosphere]] of the [[hospital]].

=== Renting an Animal for an Event ===
Another method of pet rental includes renting animals for an event. Animal Craze, a traveling farm, specializes in renting animals for [[birthday parties]] or other events. These services usually range from $200 to $500 depending on the number of [[animals]] and the kind of animals a person chooses to [[renting|rent]].&lt;ref&gt; "Rent A Dog? The Pros and Cons of Renting Dogs | The Dog Guide." ''The Dog Guide, 11 Jan. 2015, https://dogs.thefuntimesguide.com/rent_a_dog/ &lt;/ref&gt; Mobile Zoos are also a form of pet renting for events. Mobile Zoos are popular in the [[United Kingdom]] and provide exotic animals for children's parties.&lt;ref&gt; Soriano, Monica, and Emma Ailes. "Exotic animal parties 'to face new regulation'. ''BBC News'", BBD, 10 Oct. 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41551396&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of pet renting includes puppy parties. Puppy parties usually include 5-10 puppies that are placed in a playpen for people to come and either [[cuddle]], handle, or play with. If the people at the party are younger in age, they are instructed on how to properly handle the [[puppies]]. The puppies at these parties are usually between 2-6 months old.&lt;ref&gt;Tudor, Dr.Ken. "Puppy Parties: The New 'Must Do' Social Event." ''PetMD'', 18 Aug 2015, www.petmd.com/blogs/thedailyvet/ken-tudor/2015/august/puppy-parties-new-must-do-social-event-33058&lt;/ref&gt; Companies such as Puppy Parties add a cute and [[therapeutic]] aspect to [[school]], [[corporate]], and private events. Their puppies have also been seen on the ABC show [[Good Morning America]].

=== Renting Pets as a Test ===
Another common method of [[pet]] renting is to test whether or not a person is ready to take on the responsibilities of being an owner.&lt;ref&gt;"Rent A dog? The Pros and Cons of Renting Dogs | The Dog Guide." ''The Dog Guide'', 11 Jan. 2015, https://dogs.thefuntimesguide.com/rent_a_dog/&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes pet renting for various reasons listed below:

* Not being able to have [[animals]] in their house due to rental agreements.
* Not being able to have animals in the house due to [[allergies]].
* Not being able to properly take care of an animal due to excessive [[traveling]] or work.&lt;ref&gt;"Rent A dog? The Pros and Cons of Renting Dogs | The Dog Guide." ''The Dog Guide'', 11 Jan. 2015, https://dogs.thefuntimesguide.com/rent_a_dog/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not being able to currently afford an animal or supplies necessary for caring for a pet.

===Cat Cafés===
[[File:Singapore CatCafe .jpg|thumb|Adult cat perching in Singapore Cat Cafe]]
The first known [[cat café]] was located in [[Taipei]], Taiwan, named Cat Flower Garden. Opening in 1998, it became a place for stressed out visitors to come drink coffee and pet cats. Cat cafés increased in popularity in Japan because most renters were not allowed to own pets. In 2005, Shop of Cats in Tokyo became a place for single income families to enjoy the comfort of the pets that they couldn’t own. In April 2014, [[New_York_(state)|New York]] took on the cat café idea, which took off immediately. Sponsored by Purina One, it lets families meet adoptable cats. Additionally, two pop-up cat cafés in California, located in Bay area and Oakland, opened in 2014. The [[San Francisco]] location, KitTea, was open to both rescued and feral cats.The [[Oakland,_California|Oakland]] location, Cat Town, was designated to cats that were ready to be placed in a home. In Europe, cat cafés took off in places like [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/56592/brief-history-cat-cafe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dog Cafés===
Dog Cafés are popular in Korea and the United States. One café in Santa Monica, named Grounds and Hounds, sponsors shelter dogs that are up for adoption. Customers can pet these puppies in a designated area of the café. In Korea, dogs in the café are from puppy mills and are not up for adoption. This practice, however, is changing quickly. Dogs in cafés like Grounds and Hounds are adoptable shelter dogs, some suffering from physical illnesses. In these cafés, strict health codes are enforced, requiring animals and food to be separated. For the animals to stay overnight, the café was built in an industrial zone - which is a requirement given by the L.A. Health Department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laweekly.com/restaurants/forget-cat-cafes-americas-first-dog-cafe-hopes-to-open-in-la-5333526&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal Cafés in Tokyo===
In [[Tokyo]], there are pet cafés with rabbits, birds, goldfish, reptiles, goats, and penguins. These cafés are the most popular for those with strict renting policies in [[Japan]] and for tourists. To protect the well-being of the animals, some cafés have specific time limits. Other rules include that food must be separate from the animals, or there must be trained handler on hand. With some animals, specifically penguins and reptiles, visitors are there to watch, but not to touch the animals. In some cases, visitors may pay extra for pictures with the animals.

== Importance ==
One method of pet renting is [[animal assisted therapy]]. Animal assisted therapy can help to reduce [[pain]], [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] in people with a range of health issues including: children having dental procedures, people receiving [[cancer treatment]], people in long-term care facilities, people hospitalized with chronic [[heart failure]] and veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder|PTSD]].&lt;ref&gt; "Therapy dogs can be a patient's best friend." ''Mayo Clinic'', Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 19 Aug. 2016, https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/pet-therapy/art-20046342 &lt;/ref&gt; Other benefits from programs that use pet renting include not only the people who are sick, but it also includes the loved ones of the ill patients too. Patient's family can also receive benefits due to the happiness that an animal can bring to their loved ones.&lt;ref&gt; "Therapy dogs can be a patient's best friend." ''May Clinic'', Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 19 Aug. 2016, https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/pet-therapy/art-20046342&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==
===Concerns===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the use of Mobile Zoos has become a cause for concern. Because of this, Mobile Zoos will soon require licenses to operate in [[England]]. The [[RSPCA]] recently announced that the Mobile Zoos' were handling the [[meerkats]] and [[raccoons]] inappropriately.&lt;ref&gt;Soriano, Monica and Emma Ailes. "Exotic animal parties 'to face new regulations'. ''BBC News'', BBC, 10 Oct. 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41551396&lt;/ref&gt; Under the changes to the [[Animal Welfare Act 2006]], anyone who wishes to own a business that provides an animal for an exhibit must require a license from the local authority, including Mobile Zoos. The exhibits must also adhere to welfare standards developed with those working in the sector and [[animal welfare]] charities.&lt;ref&gt;Soriano, Monica and Emma Ailes. "Exotic animal parties 'to face new regulations'. ''BBC News, BBC, 10 Oct. 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41551396&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the biggest concerns that [[Hospital|hospitals]] face is the safety and sanitation that comes with the therapy dogs that visit. Most hospitals with dog therapy programs have a strict policy to ensure that animals are clean, vaccinated, well trained and screened for appropriate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;"Therapy dogs can be a patient's best friend."

===Animals in the Media===
Across the United States, there are over 40 animal talent agencies. Every day, agents audition talented animals for parts in film, theater, photo shoots, and [[television commercials]]. Each animal talent agency represents hundreds of clients which include animals in [[wildlife]] preserves, pets, and even domestic and exotic species. Though the need for animal actors is declining due to modern digital animation, for commercials, the typical rate in New York is $800 a day for a dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wills|first1=Santiago|title=The Crowded, Competitive World of Animal Acting|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/05/the-crowded-competitive-world-of-animal-acting/257897/|website=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Abuse in the Media====

In the movie ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'', reptile wrangler Jules Sylvester had brought over 27 types of [[snakes]] on the movie set. Snakes get [[Fatigue (medical)|tired]] after an hour of work, and can become over [[stress (biology)|stress]]ed, causing a snake not to eat for a week. It is for this reason that particular snakes are leased for an hour at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=I WAS THE ONE WHO PUT THOSE... SNAKES ON A PLANE|journal=People|volume=66|issue=9|url=https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/az.php? | page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal Safety===
Due to animal killing scenes in movies such as ''[[Call of the Wild]]'' (1937) the American Animal Defense League (AADL) started taking measures to protect hired animal actors from abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Courtney|title=The Utmost Care, Kindness, and Consideration|journal=Cinema Journal|volume=55|issue=4|page=108-129|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations involved popular [[Hollywood]] studios such as [[Warner Brothers]] and [[20th Century Fox]] regarding abuse in films as well as abusive living conditions. More recently, the [[American Humane Association]]'s (AHA) Film and Television Unit have taken the initiative to make sure animal actors were not harmed in the making of the movie. The AHA began monitoring the safety of animals after [[Jesse James]] provoked an outcry when a horse was forced to leap to its [[death]] from the top of a cliff in 1939. The AHA prides itself on ensuring safety for all animal actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malamud|first1=Randy|title=ANIMALS ON FILM: THE ETHICS OF THE HUMAN GAZE|date=2007|page=1-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Highest Paid Animal Actors====

The animals people gaze upon on the internet, in [[advertisements]], are prized for their “[[cuteness]].” This was seen in the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', as Toto or “[[Terry (dog)|Terry the Terrier]]” made over $125 a week, compared to the Munchkins, who made $50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuhler|title=Highest Paid Animal Actors That Are Paid More Than Most Human Actors|url=http://pawsaminute.net/highest-paid-animal-actors-that-are-paid-more-than-most-human-actors/5/|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Project On Government Oversight''' ('''POGO''') is a [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]] [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], that investigates and works to expose waste, fraud, abuse, and conflicts of interest in the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYktDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA327&amp;dq=%22Project%20On%20Government%20Oversight%22&amp;pg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Project%20On%20Government%20Oversight%22&amp;f=false|title=Washington Information Directory 2017-2018|last=|first=|date=|publisher=CQ Press|year=2017|isbn=9781506365657|location=|pages=327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its website, POGO works with [[whistleblower]]s and government insiders to identify wrongdoing in the federal government, and works with government officials to implement policy changes based on its investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/about/|title=About POGO|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; POGO is led by executive director Danielle Brian.&lt;ref name="POGO's Board and Staff"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/about/board-staff/|title=POGO's Board and Staff|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Project on Military Procurement, an arm of the National Taxpayers Legal Fund, was founded by Dina Rasor in February 1981. The Project's mission was to make the public aware of 'waste, fraud, and fat" in U.S. defense spending, according to Rasor. In the organization's early days, Rasor worked with whistleblowers to expose design flaws in the [[M1 Abrams]] tank, which had undergone a "shocking (cost) increase" in 1980, according to Rasor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0114/011458.html|title=Dina Rasor: blowing the whistle on the Pentagon|last=Webbe|first=Stephen|date=1982-01-14|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-09-08|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project first gained widespread attention in the early 1980s for publishing reports on "outrageously overpriced military spending," including a $7,600 coffee maker and a $436 hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/01/business/high-cost-of-military-parts.html|title=High Cost of Military Parts|last=Barron|first=James|date=1983-09-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jul/01/project-on-goverment-oversight|title=Would you pay $382 for a six-pack of Bud?|last=Chatterjee|first=Pratap|date=2011-07-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization expanded its scope beyond military spending and changed its name to the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) in 1990. Danielle Brian joined POGO as its executive director in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/danielle-brians-pogo-is-constantly-poking-prodding-exposing-government-waste-and-fraud/article/2533504|title=Danielle Brian's POGO is constantly poking, prodding, exposing government waste and fraud|last=McCabe|first=Neil|date=2013-07-25|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other watchdog organizations have folded into POGO over the years. In 2012, the Straus Military Reform Project of the [[Center for Defense Information]] joined POGO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/about/cdi-joins-pogo.html|title=CDI Joins POGO|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[Center for Effective Government]] (known as OMB Watch until 2013) folded and became part of POGO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.govexec.com/oversight/2016/03/two-longstanding-good-government-groups-join-forces/126786/|title=Two Longstanding Good-Government Groups Join Forces|last=Clark|first=Charles S.|date=2016-03-18|work=Government Executive|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
POGO currently has a staff of about 28 people, according to its website.&lt;ref name="POGO's Board and Staff"/&gt; Its board of directors includes investigative reporter [[David Burnham]], [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] senior fellow [[Sarah Chayes]], ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' editor [[Andrew Cockburn]], former Republican congressman [[Mickey Edwards]], lawyer [[Pamela Gilbert]], political scientist [[Norman Ornstein]], and investigative reporter [[Morton Mintz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/about/board-staff/board-of-directors.html|title=POGO's Board of Directors|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is funded through grants from a variety of foundations, as well as private donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/about/foundation-support.html|title=Foundation Support|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to maintain its independence, POGO does not accept government grants or corporate funding, according to its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/donate-to-pogo/contribution-acceptance-policy.html|title=POGO Contribution Acceptance Policy|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization made $2,504,184 in revenue in 2016, according to its [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] public disclosure form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogoarchives.org/m/xp/990/2016_pogo_form_990_public.pdf|title=Project On Government Oversight 2016 Form 990|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected work==

=== Cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider ===
POGO was instrumental in the cancellation of the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]'s [[Superconducting Super Collider]] project in 1993. After receiving a draft Department of Energy inspector general report from a whistleblower, POGO helped make public the fact that 40 percent of the project's budget had been spent on parties, office plants, and "other frivolities."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Area 51 hazardous waste investigation ===
POGO reported that in 1995 it was contacted by a woman who claimed her husband had died as the result of being exposed to toxic waste while working at [[Area 51]]. At the time, the U.S. government denied the existence of the Area 51, but POGO turned to [[George Washington University]] law professor [[Jonathan Turley]] to sue the government on behalf of the woman and six former Area 51 workers for illnesses and death as a result of toxic waste exposure at Area 51.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/blog/2013/08/government-confirms-area-51-but-answers-still-secret.html|title=Government Confirms Area 51, But Answers Still Secret|last=Amey|first=Scott|date=2013-08-19|website=Project On Government Oversight|language=en|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogoarchives.org/m/gp/a/Brian%20Declaration.pdf|title=Declaration of Danielle Brian in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss|last=|first=|date=2004-09-03|website=|publisher=United States District Court for the District of Columbia|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; POGO executive director Danielle Brian said that, during the litigation, the organization obtained an unclassified Area 51 security manual, which POGO gave to Turley and the plaintiffs so they could prove Area 51 existed. The [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] then retroactively classified the manual, "threatened to prosecute anyone who had it in their possession, and demanded access to all of POGO's files to determine what other 'classified' information POGO possessed," Brian wrote in a signed legal declaration.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The court ruled that the plaintiffs' case could not be proved because it could not confirm the existence of Area 51, however Area 51 was thereafter required to comply with environmental laws.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2013, the government confirmed that Area 51 exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wtop.com/news/2013/08/us-releases-records-confirming-existence-of-area-51/|title=U.S. releases records confirming existence of Area 51|date=2013-08-15|work=WTOP|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unpaid oil royalties investigation ===
POGO released a series of reports from 1995 to 1997 that said the U.S. federal government was owed billions of dollars in unpaid oil royalties from companies that drilled oil from public lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/reports/90s/nr-oil-1995.html|title=Department of Interior Looks the Other Way: The Government's Slick Deal for the Oil Industry|last=|first=|date=1995|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/reports/90s/nr-oil-1996.html|title=Wait!

=== Federal Contractor Misconduct Database ===
In 2002, POGO launched the Federal Contractor Misconduct Database, a website that compiles instances of "misconduct and alleged misconduct" by the top government contractors since 1995, according to the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contractormisconduct.org/about-fcmd|title=About FCMD|last=|first=|date=|website=Federal Contractor Misconduct Database|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; POGO's database was the inspiration for a similar federal government database that was created by the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://washingtontechnology.com/articles/2008/11/04/contractor-watchdog-updates-misconduct-database.aspx|title=Contractor watchdog updates misconduct database|last=Lipowicz|first=Alice|date=2008-11-04|website=Washington Technology|language=en|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; When POGO updated its database in 2010, it was reported that the organization had "found 642 instances since 1995 of misconduct by the top 100 firms, resulting in $18.7 billion in penalties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.govexec.com/oversight/2010/04/watchdog-group-releases-updated-contractor-misconduct-database/31358/|title=Watchdog group releases updated contractor misconduct database|last=Newell Jochum|first=Elizabeth|date=2010-04-23|work=Government Executive|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuit against John Ashcroft ===
In 2004, POGO filed a lawsuit against then-U.S. Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] for illegally retroactively classifying documents critical of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. The classification came to light after [[Sibel Edmonds]], an FBI translator, discovered that intercepted memos relevant to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] had been ignored due to poor translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/07/05/translator_in_eye_of_storm_on_retroactive_classification/?page=full|title=Translator in eye of storm on retroactive classification|last=Kornblut|first=Anne E.|date=2007-07-05|website=The Boston Globe|language=en|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; POGO won the lawsuit in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizen.org/media/press-releases/justice-department-cavesin-allows-publication-retroactively-classified|title=Justice Department Caves In: Allows Publication of Retroactively Classified Information|last=|first=|date=2005-02-22|website=Public Citizen|language=en|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional Oversight Initiative ===
In 2006, POGO launched a series of nonpartisan trainings to teach congressional staff how to conduct oversight and investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.govexec.com/management/2006/12/congressional-staff-members-gather-tips-on-oversight/23232/|title=Congressional staff members gather tips on oversight|last=Singer|first=Paul W.|date=2006-12-01|work=Government Executive|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, POGO has hosted monthly training, as well as specialized training upon request, according to the organization's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/coi/|title=Congressional Oversight Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ending the Royalty-In-Kind program ===
In 2008, POGO released a report that documented corruption and mismanagement in the Department of the Interior's [[Minerals Management Service]] (MMS) royalty-in-kind program. The investigation revealed inadequate royalty accounting, as well as the provision of sex, drugs, and other favors to MMS officials by oil company representatives in exchange for favorable business deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/reports/2008/nr-rik-20080918.html|title=Drilling the Taxpayer: Department of Interior's Royalty-In-Kind Program|last=|first=|date=2008-09-18|website=Project On Government Oversight|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this report and others by the federal [[Government Accountability Office]], the royalty in-kind program was terminated, and MMS was split into three different bureaus.&lt;ref name="TNRMMS"&gt;DePillis, Lydia (September 18, 2009).

=== Kabul embassy investigation ===
In 2009, POGO conducted an investigation into [[ArmorGroup]], a private security contractor in charge of protecting the U.S. embassy in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. POGO uncovered and released documents, photos, and videos depicting drunken behavior, nudity, and hazing among the guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/09/animal-house-afghanistan/|title=Animal House in Afghanistan|last=Schulman|first=Daniel|date=2009-09-01|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/letters/2009/co-gp-20090901.html|title=POGO Letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton regarding U.S. Embassy in Kabul|last=Brian|first=Danielle|date=2009-09-01|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; POGO's investigation led to the dismissal of several managers and eight guards, the resignation of an additional two guards, and ultimately, the cancellation of the U.S. military's contract with ArmorGroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/12/armorgroup-axed-kabul-embassy-contract/|title=ArmorGroup Loses Kabul Embassy Contract|last=Schulman|first=Daniel|date=2009-12-08|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear facility safety investigations ===
POGO has conducted numerous investigations into the Los Alamos National Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pogo.org/investigations/nuclear-security/lanl.html Los Alamos National Laboratory Files] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707025243/http://www.pogo.org/investigations/nuclear-security/lanl.html |date=2010-07-07 }}. The Project On Government Oversight website.&lt;/ref&gt; LANL has been the subject of several controversies in the past, including employees charging personal expenses to government accounts,&lt;ref&gt;Schactman, Noah. (November 8, 2002) [https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2002/11/56270 "Los Alamos on Hot Seat Again]. [[Wired News]].&lt;/ref&gt; lost equipment or documents (including hundreds of computers containing classified information),&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, Michael.

[[New York Times]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 69 computers disappeared, although plant officials insisted that the computers did not contain the most highly classified information.&lt;ref&gt;Reichbach, Matthew. (February 12, 2009) [http://newmexicoindependent.com/18263/69-computers-missing-at-lanl "69 Computers Missing at LANL"]. [[The New Mexico Independent]].&lt;/ref&gt; 2009 also saw a scare in which 2.2 pounds of missing plutonium prompted a [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] investigation into the plant. The investigation found that the "missing plutonium" was a result of miscalculation by LANL's statisticians and did not actually exist, but the investigation did lead to heavy criticism of the plant by the DOE for security flaws and weaknesses that the DOE claimed to have found.&lt;ref&gt;Vartabedian, Ralph.

=== FDA conflicts of interest investigation ===
Starting in 2011, POGO conducted an investigation into conflicts of interest of an advisory committee at the [[Food and Drug Administration]] that was reviewing the Yaz and [[Drospirenone|Yasmin]] birth control pills. POGO found that four members of the committee had ties to either the maker of the pills or the maker of a generic version, but did not announce the conflicts before endorsing the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-stanford-doctor-in-birth-control-vote-had-ties-to--2012jan20-htmlstory.html|title=Stanford doctor in birth control vote had ties to pill's maker|last=|first=|date=2012-01-20|work=San Diego Union Tribune|access-date=2017-09-09|agency=The Center for Investigative Reporting|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Yaz and Yasmin have been linked to fatal blood clots in some users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/health/policy/stronger-label-urged-for-yaz-and-yasmin-contraceptives.html|title=Stronger Label Urged for Yaz and Yasmin Contraceptives|last=Belluck|first=Pam|date=2011-12-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advocacy for Camp Lejeune victims ===
In 2012, POGO working with whistleblower retired Marine Corps Master Sgt. Jerry Ensminger, advocated for openness regarding [[Camp Lejeune water contamination|toxic water contamination]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]] in North Carolina. From 1953 until at least 1985, U.S. Marines and their families living at Camp Lejeune had used tap water that contained [[carcinogens]] and other harmful chemicals leaking from a nearby dump site for radioactive material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/report-camp-lejeune-water-contaminated-at-unprecedented-levels/2108929|title=Report: Camp Lejeune water highly contaminated with carcinogens|last=Levesque|first=William R.|date=2013-03-14|website=Tampa Bay Times|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; POGO and other organizations claimed in 2012 that the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] hid information about the nature and extent of the contamination, citing a report released by the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] that was redacted by the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openthegovernment.org/sites/default/files/Secretary%20Panetta%20II%20on%20Camp%20Lejeune%201.23.2012.pdf|title=Letter to Secretary of Defense Panetta|last=|first=|date=2012-01-24|website=Open The Government|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] voted to approve healthcare for those who lived at Camp Lejeune and suffered health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pogoblog.typepad.com/pogo/2012/07/closer-than-ever-to-justice-for-camp-lejeune-water-contamination-victims.html|title=Closer Than Ever to Justice for Camp Lejeune Water Contamination Victims|last=Canterbury|first=Angela|date=2012-09-19|work=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans' Affairs]] finalized rules to provide benefits for people who had been diagnosed with certain diseases as a result of living at Camp Lejeune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/military/veterans/us-agrees-to-pay-billions-to-marines-affected-by-toxic-water-at-camp/2309435|title=U.S. agrees to pay billions to Marines affected by toxic water at Camp Lejeune|last=Levesque|first=William R.|date=2017-01-12|website=Tampa Bay Times|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defense spending and Straus Military Reform Project ===
POGO has conducted many investigations into defense spending, particularly in cases where, "national security and needs of the troops have been compromised by greed, lack of oversight, and in many cases, sheer incompetence," according to its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/our-work/national-security.html|title=Our Work - National Security|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the weapons systems that POGO has been critical of include the [[littoral combat ship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pogo.org/straus/issues/weapons/2016/overhaul-of-littoral-combat.html|title=Overhaul of Littoral Combat Ship Program Likely to Increase Risks and Costs|last=Smithberger|first=Mandy|date=2016-12-13|work=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-11|last2=Sprey|first2=Pierre}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F/A-22 fighter aircraft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pogo.org/straus/issues/weapons/2005/air-forces-fa-22-is-a-relic-and-a-loser.html|title=Air Force's F/A-22 is a Relic and a Loser|last=Wheeler|first=Winslow|date=2005-02-02|work=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35 joint strike fighter aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pogo.org/straus/issues/weapons/2014/how-much-does-an-f-35-cost.html|title=How Much Does an F-35 Actually Cost?|last=Wheeler|first=Winslow|date=2017-07-29|work=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, POGO has supported the production of the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 aircraft]] for its relative effectiveness and inexpensiveness compared to what POGO considers more wasteful weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pogo.org/straus/issues/weapons/2017/air-force-headquarters-starving-a-10-squadrons-again.html|title=Air Force Headquarters Starving A-10 Squadrons (Again)|last=Grazier|first=Dan|date=2017-06-16|work=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-11|last2=Smithberger|first2=Mandy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Straus Military Reform Project of the [[Center for Defense Information]] moved to POGO with director and military analyst [[Winslow T. Wheeler|Winslow Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogo.org/straus/about/cdi-at-pogo.html|title=CDI at POGO|website=Project On Government Oversight|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler retired in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/winslow-wheeler-114795|title=Winslow Wheeler’s War|last=Wright|first=Austin|date=2015-02-01|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whistleblower protection ===
POGO, along with several other public interest groups, was involved in the investigation and trial of [[Scott Bloch]], ex-head of the U.S. [[Office of Special Counsel]] (OSC). Bloch was accused by former OSC employees of ignoring and dismissing hundreds of whistleblower complaints, removing language guaranteeing protection against sexual orientation discrimination from OSC's website and official documents, and "relocating" several of his own employees who came forward with these allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pogoarchives.org/m/gp/gp-OSCcomplaint-03032005.pdf|title=Complaint of Prohibited Personnel Practices Against Special Counsel Scott Bloch|author=Adams &amp; Katz, Esq|date=March 3, 2005|publisher=POGO|format=PDF|accessdate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these accusations led to a congressional investigation of Bloch, Bloch allegedly hired a technology company to wipe the memory of his computer and several other OSC laptops in order to hide key evidence from the investigators. Bloch initially claimed that he ordered this as protection against a virus that had infected his computer, but he later admitted he was trying to withhold information.&lt;ref&gt;Wilke, John (November 28, 2007).

POGO has worked to protect the rights of several specific whistleblowers—including Franz Gayl, who criticized military leaders' decision to not deliver protective armored vehicles called [[MRAP]]s to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis, who challenged military leaders' depictions of the "rosy" situation on the ground in Afghanistan—by sending letters to Congress and the agencies involved.&lt;ref&gt;Ukman, Jason (November 17, 2011).

== Whistleblower award incident ==
In 1998, POGO, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit under the [[False Claims Act]], suing the largest oil and gas companies operating in the United States. The lawsuit alleged that the companies had defrauded the government by underpaying royalties owed for drilling on federal lands. By 2002, 15 companies had settled, paying a total of almost $440 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/business/yourmoney/03whistle.html|title=Blowing the Whistle on Big Oil|last=Andrews|first=Edmund L.|date=2006-12-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; POGO was awarded about $1.2 million from the settlements in 1998. That year, POGO shared its settlement with two federal employee whistleblowers, saying the payment was a "Public Service Award" to the whistleblowers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2012/12/17/mistrial-declared-in-case-of-watchdog-group|title=Mistrial declared in case of watchdog group|last=Frommer|first=Frederic J.|date=2012-12-17|work=Associated Press|access-date=2017-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218010458/http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2012/12/17/mistrial-declared-in-case-of-watchdog-group|archive-date=2012-12-18|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the news of the award in 1999, U.S. Senator [[Frank Murkowski]] asked the [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] to investigate whether the payment represented "improper influence" on the Department of the Interior's new oil royalty valuation policy. The agency released a report in 2000 that said it appeared POGO paid the two employees to influence the Department of the Interior to take actions and make policies that benefited POGO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8jFG884WKQC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Project+On+Government+Oversight&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bxs-TLDNF4WosQOow8DaCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Report on an Inquiry into Payments Made by the Project on Government Oversight to Two Federal Officials|last=|first=|publisher=General Accounting Office|year=July 2000|isbn=9781428918436|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While calling the payments a "mistake" on POGO's part, U.S. Senator [[Jeff Bingaman]] disputed the agency's report, saying that it did not provide any evidence that the payments were improper.&lt;ref&gt;Bingaman, Jeff (U.S. Sen) (September 5, 2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vLg4iJR0J9kC&amp;pg=PA16998&amp;dq=Project+On+Government+Oversight&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bxs-TLDNF4WosQOow8DaCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Project%20On%20Government%20Oversight&amp;f=false Congressional Record, 106th Congress, Volume 145 Part 12. Pg. 16998] U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, U.S. Representative [[Don Young]] threatened bringing a [[Contempt of Congress]] charge against POGO, after the organization refused to comply with a [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] subpoena for documents relating to the payments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&amp;p_theme=sl&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB05285C5D897A1&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM House Panel Seeks Contempt of Congress Charges Against Watchdog Group - Organization exposed oil companies' underpayment of royalties to government].

In 2003, the Department of Justice filed a civil action against POGO and one of the federal employees, and a [[United States district court|U.S. district judge]] ruled in favor of the agency. POGO appealed the case and went to trial in 2008, where a jury found POGO and the federal employee had violated the law. The judge ordered POGO to pay only $120,000 because he said the organization had acted "in good faith" when they made the payments. However, in 2010, the appeals court found the district judge had made a mistake in his directions to the jury. POGO and the agency went to trial again in 2012, but a mistrial was declared after jurors couldn't come to a unanimous verdict.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A month later, in 2013, the Department of Justice said it would not litigate on the matter for a third time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/404450|title=DOJ Shuns 3rd Trial In POGO Gov't Worker Payment Case|last=Teichert|first=Erica|date=2013-12-03|website=Law360|language=en|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rodriguez v Minister of Housing''''' is a 2009 [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC) case that held that it was unconstitutional for the government of [[Gibraltar]] to turn down an application for joint tenancy in government housing to a [[same-sex couple]].

Nadine Rodriguez and her unmarried female partner of 21 years applied to the Housing Allocation Committee for approval of a joint tenancy in government-owned housing. The Committee had a policy of only approving joint tenancies in cases where a couple were married or were unmarried partners with a child in common. Rodriguez and her partner's application was turned down because they did not meet the criteria. The [[Court of Appeal of Gibraltar]] held that the policy was not unconstitutionally discriminatory.

The JCPC held that the government's policy was discriminatory and thereby violated the [[Constitution of Gibraltar]]. The discriminatory impact was greater upon same-sex partners than other unmarried couples since same-sex partners were prohibited from marrying and cannot have biological children in common.

The JCPC rejected Gibraltar's argument that the policy protected marriage and children, because denying benefits to those who cannot marry does not protect those who can. The JCPC emphasised that the decision did not mean that Gibraltar was obliged to introduce [[same-sex marriage]] or same-sex civil partnerships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">This '''[[Sakoku]] Edict''' (''Sakoku-rei'', 鎖国令) of 1635 was a Japanese decree intended to eliminate foreign influence, enforced by strict government rules and regulations to impose these ideas. It was the third of a series issued by [[Tokugawa Iemitsu]] {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, ''[[shōgun]]'' of [[Japan]] from 1623 to 1651. The Edict of 1635 is considered a prime example of the Japanese desire for seclusion. The Edict of 1635 was written to the two commissioners of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], a port city located in southwestern Japan.

== Japan before seclusion ==

Before the issuing of the exclusion edicts in 1633, Japanese fascination with European culture brought trade of various goods and commercial success to the country.  Items such as eyeglasses, clocks, firearms, and artillery were in high demand in Japan, and trade began to flourish between the Japanese and Europe.

With the exchange of goods came the exchange of ideas as well.  Christian [[missionaries]], such as [[Francis Xavier]], were among the first to travel to Japan to teach [[Catholicism]].  For a time, they were encouraged to enlighten the Japanese people, and [[Oda Nobunaga]], during his reign as military leader of Japan in the 1570s and 1580s, encouraged the conversion of the Japanese to Catholicism.  His hopes of competing with his [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] rivals led him to allow Catholic missionary activity in Japan.  In [[Kyoto]], Japan’s capital city, a large portion of the population had already been converted to Christianity by the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrea |first= Alfred |author2=James H. Overfield  |title= The Human Record: Sources of Global History |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]] |location= Boston, MA |isbn= 0-618-37041-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Nobunaga was [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], who ruled over Japan from 1582 to 1598.  Anti-European attitudes began under Hideyoshi, whose suspicion of the Europeans first began with their intimidating appearance; their armed ships and sophisticated military power produced doubt and distrust, and following the conquest of the [[Philippines]] by the Spanish, Hideyoshi was convinced they were not to be trusted.  The true motives of the Europeans came quickly into question.

Those who converted to Catholicism were questioned about their loyalty to Japan, and in 1597, Hideyoshi ordered the crucifixion of nine Catholic missionaries and seventeen Japanese converts.  This was only the start of the hostility towards European influence and interaction; persecutions, beheadings, and forced conversions would all but eliminate the Christian community over the next few decades.

== Decrees of the Edict ==

The key points of the Edict of 1635 included:
* The Japanese were to be kept within Japan’s own boundaries. Strict rules were set to prevent them from leaving the country. Anyone caught trying to leave the country, or anyone who managed to leave and then returned from abroad, was to be executed. Europeans who entered Japan illegally would face the death penalty too.
* Catholicism was strictly forbidden.  Those found practicing the Christian faith were subject to investigation, and anyone associated with Catholicism would be punished. To encourage the search for those who still followed Christianity, rewards were given to those who were willing to turn them in. Prevention of missionary activity was also stressed by the edict; no missionary was allowed to enter, and if apprehended by the government, he would face imprisonment.
* Trade restrictions and strict limitations on goods were set to limit the ports open to trade, and the merchants who would be allowed to engage in trade.  Relations with the Portuguese were cut off entirely; Chinese merchants and those of the [[Dutch East India Company]] were restricted to enclaves in Nagasaki.  Trade was also conducted with China through the semi-independent vassal [[Ryukyu Kingdom|kingdom of the Ryukyus]], with [[Korea]] via the [[Tsushima Domain]], and also with the [[Ainu people]] through the [[Matsumae clan|Matsumae Domain]].

==Enforcement==

As a way of enforcing the edict, investigation methods such as the anti-Christian inquisition were established to expose those still practicing Catholicism. The ''[[fumie|fumi-e]]'' ceremony was considered yet another way of detecting a Christian; to reveal any individual that was still loyal to the Christian faith, a picture resembling that of [[Jesus]] or [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] was placed on the floor of a pagoda, and everyone within the building was required to step on it. If any hesitation was visible, or any reluctance was detected, that individual was automatically suspect and subject to investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hagemann |first= Edward |date=June 1942 |title= The Persecution of the Christians in Japan in the Middle of the Seventeenth Century |journal= The Pacific Historical Review |volume= 11 |issue= 2|jstor=3633765|doi=10.2307/3633765  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monetary rewards were also offered to anyone who had information regarding the violation of the edict. Anyone suspect of disregarding the decree would undergo a thorough investigation, and punishment usually followed. The allowance of ships was strictly regulated; only specific vessels were permitted to enter Japan, and merchants had to obtain special licenses to trade. Although trade was not cut off completely, it was very rare. To discourage those from embracing anything even remotely related to Europe, the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] punished any offenders that happened to surface. Many were publicly tortured, and often faced the death penalty as a result of their practices.

==After the Edict==

Following the precedence of this seclusion edict, others followed in its footsteps. One example is the edict detailing the Exclusion of the Portuguese in 1639. This isolationist policy would continue to thrive until 1854, over two hundred years later, when [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Commodore Perry]] from the Americas embraced Japan at the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] (''Nichibei Washin Jōyaku'', 日米和親条約). Although the isolationist policy was not willingly given up, on July 29, 1858, Japan and the United States signed the [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] (''Nichibei Shūkō Tsūshō Jōyaku'', 日米修好通商条約), also known as the Harris Treaty. The signing of this document opened numerous trade ports in areas such as [[Edo]], [[Kobe]], [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]] and [[Yokohama]] along Japan’s coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bulliet |first= Richard |author2=Pamela Kyle Crossley |author3=Daniel R.

[[File:No Smoking.svg|right|thumb|An internationally recognizable "No Smoking" sign.]]

'''Smoking bans''' (or '''smoke-free laws''') are public policies, including [[criminal law]]s and [[occupational safety and health]] regulations, that [[prohibitionism|prohibit]] [[tobacco smoking]] in [[employment|workplace]]s and other [[public space]]s. Legislation may also define [[smoking]] as more generally being the carrying or possessing of any lit tobacco product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/36/00601-01.htm | title = 36-601.01 – Smoke-free Arizona act | date =  | website = Arizona Revised Statutes Title 36 – Public Health and Safety | chapter = 6.

==Rationale==
[[File:Valdez Trash Pile.jpg|thumb|Sometimes smoking is prohibited for safety reasons related to the burning [[ember]]s produced. Oily waste is piled up after the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] next to a small ''No Smoking'' sign.]]
Smoking bans are enacted in an attempt to protect people from the effects of [[second-hand smoke]], which include an increased risk of [[heart disease]], [[cancer]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]], and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Smokefree legislation consultation response, The Institute of Public Health in Ireland | url=http://www.publichealth.ie/index.asp?locID=396 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008192053/http://www.publichealth.ie/index.asp?locID=396 | archive-date=8 October 2007 | access-date=5 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New health bill will ban smoking in majority of workplaces |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_10027079 |access-date=5 September 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509062745/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_10027079 |archive-date=9 May 2007 }} Archived from the [http://www.direct.gov.uk/Nl1/Newsroom/NewsroomArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10027079&amp;chk=5r8ic9 original]. (UK Health Secretary: The smoking ban "is a huge step forward for public health and will help reduce deaths from cancer, heart disease and other smoking related diseases") See also [http://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/WHO_FCTC_english.pdf WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]; First international treaty on public health, adopted by 192 countries and signed by 168. See in particular Article 8 ''Protection from exposure to tobacco smoke''.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws implementing bans on indoor smoking have been introduced by many countries in various forms over the years, with some [[legislator]]s citing scientific  evidence that shows tobacco smoking is harmful to the smokers themselves and to those inhaling second-hand smoke.'''

In addition such laws may reduce [[health care]] costs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barendregt JJ, Bonneux L, van der Maas PJ | title = The health care costs of smoking | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 337 | issue = 15 | pages = 1052–7 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9321534 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199710093371506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; improve work productivity, and lower the overall cost of labour in the community thus protected, making that workforce more attractive for employers. In the US state of [[Indiana]], the economic development agency included in its 2006 plan for acceleration of economic growth encouragement for cities and towns to adopt local smoking bans as a means of promoting job growth in communities.

Additional rationales for [[smoking]] restrictions include reduced risk of fire in areas with explosive hazards; cleanliness in places where food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, or precision instruments and machinery are produced; decreased legal liability; potentially reduced energy use via decreased [[HVAC|ventilation]] needs; reduced quantities of litter; healthier environments; and giving smokers incentive to quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New health bill will ban smoking in majority of workplaces | url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/Nl1/Newsroom/NewsroomArticles/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=10027079&amp;chk=5r8ic9 | date=28 October 2005 | access-date=5 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] considers smoking bans to have an influence to reduce demand for tobacco by creating an environment where smoking becomes increasingly more difficult and to help shift social norms away from the acceptance of smoking in everyday life. Along with tax measures, cessation measures, and education, smoking bans are viewed by public health experts as an important element in reducing smoking rates and promoting positive health outcomes. When effectively implemented they are seen as an important element of policy to support behaviour change in favour of a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/fctc/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |title=WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control |access-date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banning smoking in public places has helped to cut premature births by 10 percent, according to new research from the United States and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/28/us-smoking-bans-idUSBREA2R00420140328 | work=Reuters | title=Smoking bans cut premature births and child asthma attacks | date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence basis==
{{Main|Passive smoking}}
Research has generated evidence that [[second-hand smoke]] causes the same problems as direct smoking, including [[lung cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[respiratory disease|lung ailments]] such as [[emphysema]], [[bronchitis]], and [[asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdg305 |title=European Code Against Cancer and scientific justification: Third version (2003) |journal=Annals of Oncology |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=973–1005 |year=2003 |last1=Boyle |first1=P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] show that lifelong non-smokers with partners who smoke in the home have a 20–30% greater risk of lung cancer than non-smokers who live with non-smokers. Non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke in the workplace have an increased lung cancer risk of 16–19%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasco AJ, Secretan MB, Straif K | title = Tobacco smoking and cancer: a brief review of recent epidemiological evidence | journal = Lung Cancer | volume = 45 Suppl 2 | pages = S3-9 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15552776 | doi = 10.1016/j.lungcan.2004.07.998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study issued in 2002 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded that non-smokers are exposed to the same carcinogens on account of tobacco smoke as active smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author1=Jerry Markon |author2=Renae Merle | title= Disparity in Protecting Food Service Staff from Secondhand Smoke Shows Need for Comprehensive Smoke-Free Policies, Say Groups | date=13 April 2004 | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20996825_ITM }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sidestream smoke]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/pqrs/sidestream-smoke.htm Glossary: Sidestream smoke]&lt;/ref&gt; contains 69 known carcinogens, particularly [[benzopyrene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Involuntary smoking | url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol83/02-involuntary.html | access-date=15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and radioactive decay products, such as [[polonium-210]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferri ES, Baratta EJ | title = Polonium 210 in tobacco, cigarette smoke, and selected human organs | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–7 | date = February 1966 | pmid = 4954992 | pmc = 1919781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in [[second-hand smoke]] than in mainstream smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schick S, Glantz S | title = Philip Morris toxicological experiments with fresh sidestream smoke: more toxic than mainstream smoke | journal = Tobacco Control | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 396–404 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16319363 | pmc = 1748121 | doi = 10.1136/tc.2005.011288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific organisations confirming the effects of second-hand smoke include the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/10/index.html Health Effects of Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905172350/http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/10/index.html |date=5 September 2007 }}: A monograph from the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]].

===Air quality in bars and restaurants===
Restrictions upon smoking in bars and restaurants can substantially improve the air quality in such establishments. For example, one study listed on the website of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] states that New York's statewide law to eliminate smoking in enclosed workplaces and public places substantially reduced RSP (respirable suspended particles) levels in western New York hospitality venues. RSP levels were reduced in every venue that permitted smoking before the law was implemented, including venues in which only [[second-hand smoke]] from an adjacent room was observed at baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Indoor Air Quality in Hospitality Venues Before and After Implementation of a Clean Indoor Air Law --- Western New York, 2003 |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |date=12 November 2004 |volume=53 |issue=44 |pages=1038–1041 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5344a3.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC concluded that their results were similar to other studies which also showed substantially improved indoor air quality after smoking bans were instituted.

A 2004 study showed [[New Jersey]] bars and restaurants had more than nine times the levels of indoor air pollution of neighbouring New York City, which had already enacted its smoking ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Study Finds That New Jersey Bars and Restaurants Have Nine Times More Air Pollution than Those in Smoke-Free New York | url= http://www.umdnj.edu/about/news_events/releases/04/r041214_bars.htm | deadurl= yes | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060223231929/http://www.umdnj.edu/about/news_events/releases/04/r041214_bars.htm | archive-date= 23 February 2006 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also shown that improved air quality translates to decreased [[toxin]] exposure among employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Nina Athey-Pollard |periodical=Chemical Science | title= Smoking ban leads to healthier bar staff | url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2006/04/smoking_ban.asp |publisher=RSC Publishing |date=16 March 2006 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, among employees of the Norwegian establishments that enacted smoking restrictions, tests showed decreased levels of [[nicotine]] in the urine of both smoking and non-smoking workers (as compared with measurements prior to going smoke-free).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellingsen DG, Fladseth G, Daae HL, Gjølstad M, Kjaerheim K, Skogstad M, Olsen R, Thorud S, Molander P | title = Airborne exposure and biological monitoring of bar and restaurant workers before and after the introduction of a smoking ban | journal = Journal of Environmental Monitoring | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 362–8 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16528420 | doi = 10.1039/b600050a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Health Law Research===
In 2009, the Public Health Law Research Program, a national program office of the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], published an evidence brief summarising the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health. They stated that "There is strong evidence supporting smoking bans and restrictions as effective public health interventions aimed at decreasing exposure to secondhand smoke."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichealthlawresearch.org/public-health-topics/drugs-alcohol-and-tobacco/evidence-brief/workplace-smoking-bans-and-restriction Workplace Smoking Bans and Restrictions, Public Health Law Research 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414113815/http://publichealthlawresearch.org/public-health-topics/drugs-alcohol-and-tobacco/evidence-brief/workplace-smoking-bans-and-restriction |date=14 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|List of smoking bans}}

[[File:Smoke Ban ABC.ogv|thumb|1973 and 2007 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news reports on the initial, and then the complete, indoor smoking bans in [[Victoria, Australia]].]]
One of the world's earliest smoking bans was a 1575 Roman Catholic Church regulation which forbade the use of tobacco in any church in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://nypost.com/2010/12/19/could-smoking-become-extinct/ | title=Could smoking become extinct? | first=Kyle | last=Smith | date=19 December 2010 | newspaper=New York Post | access-date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1604, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] published an anti-smoking treatise, [[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]], that had the effect of raising taxes on tobacco. The Ottoman Sultan [[Murad IV]] prohibited smoking in his empire in 1633 and had smokers [[death penalty|executed]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/01/the-ashtray-of-history/305532/|title=The ashtray of history|magazine=The Atlantic|first=Abigail|last=Cutler|date=January 2007|access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Urban VII also prohibited smoking in the Church in 1590&lt;ref&gt;Lader, Malcolm Harold; Henningfield, Jack E.; Martin Jarvis (1985). Nicotine, an old-fashioned addiction. London: Burke Publishing. pp. 96–8.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Urban VIII in 1624.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Pope Urban VII threatened to [[excommunication|excommunicate]] anyone who "took tobacco in the porchway of or inside a church, whether it be by chewing it, smoking it with a pipe or sniffing it in powdered form through the nose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lader, Malcolm Harold |author2=Henningfield, Jack E. |author3=Martin Jarvis |title=Nicotine, an old-fashioned addiction |publisher=Burke Publishing |location=London |year=1985 |pages=96–8 |isbn=978-0-222-01216-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest citywide European smoking bans were enacted shortly thereafter. Such bans were enacted in [[Bavaria]], Kursachsen, and certain parts of Austria in the late 17th century. Smoking was banned in Berlin in 1723, in [[Königsberg]] in 1742, and in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in 1744. These bans were repealed in the [[revolutions of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Proctor RN | title = The Nazi war on tobacco: ideology, evidence, and possible cancer consequences | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 435–88 | date = Fall 1997 | pmid = 9302840 | doi = 10.1353/bhm.1997.0139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first building in the world to ban smoking was the [[Old Government Buildings, Wellington|Old Government Building]] in [[Wellington]], New Zealand in 1876. This was over concerns about the threat of fire, as it is the second largest wooden building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acwp.thanh.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/2006_architecture_week.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724194458/http://acwp.thanh.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/2006_architecture_week.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], three provinces banned underage smoking: [[New Brunswick]] (1890), [[Ontario]] (1892), and [[Nova Scotia]] (1892). A similar federal ban was passed in 1908, as a compromise on total prohibition for all ages nationwide.&lt;ref name=Alston_2002&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 39| issue = 4| pages = 425–445| last1 = Alston| first1 = Lee J.| last2 = Dupré| first2 = Ruth| last3 = Nonnenmacher| first3 = Tomas | name-list-format = vanc | title = Social reformers and regulation: the prohibition of cigarettes in the United States and Canada| journal = Explorations in Economic History| date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1890, 26 American states banned sales to minors. Further restrictions were imposed over the next decade.&lt;ref name=Alston_2002/&gt; Sale restrictions, including prohibition, were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Supreme Court | title = Austin v. Tennessee, 179 U.S. 343 (1900) | url = https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/179/343/ | date = November 1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern attempt at restricting smoking was [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|imposed by the German government]] in every university, post office, military hospital, and Nazi Party office, under the auspices of Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research, created in 1941 under orders from [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/30.1.31 |title=Commentary: Schairer and Schöniger's forgotten tobacco epidemiology and the Nazi quest for racial purity |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=30 |pages=31–34 |year=2001 |last1=Proctor |first1=Robert N | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major anti-tobacco campaigns were widely broadcast by the Nazis until the demise of the regime in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clough JD, Lewis EJ, Lachin JM | title = Treatment protocols of the lupus nephritis collaborative study of plasmapheresis in severe lupus nephritis.

In the latter part of the 20th century, as research on the risks of second-hand tobacco smoke became public, the tobacco industry launched "courtesy awareness" campaigns. Fearing reduced sales, the industry created a media and legislative programme that focused upon "accommodation". Tolerance and courtesy were encouraged as a way to ease heightened tensions between smokers and those around them, while avoiding smoking bans.

In 1975, the U.S. state of Minnesota enacted the ''Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act'', making it the first state to restrict smoking in most public spaces. At first, restaurants were required to have No Smoking sections, and bars were exempt from the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/mciaa/ftb/index.html |title=Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act – Freedom to Breathe |publisher=Minnesota Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 October 2007, Minnesota enacted a ban on smoking in all restaurants and bars statewide, called the [[Freedom to Breathe Act]] of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Martiga Lohn |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/05/13/minnesota_lawmakers_approve_smoking_ban/ |title=Minnesota lawmakers approve smoking ban |publisher=Boston Globe |date=13 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resort town of [[Aspen, Colorado]], became the first city in the US to restrict smoking in restaurants, in 1985, though it allowed smoking in areas that were separately ventilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Judith | last = Cummings | name-list-format = vanc |agency=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/04/us/beverly-hills-smoking-ban-clears-air-but-ash-trays-stay.html |title=BEVERLY HILLS SMOKING BAN CLEARS AIR BUT ASH TRAYS STAY |publisher=New York Times|date=4 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 1987, the City of [[Beverly Hills, California]], initiated an ordinance to restrict smoking in most restaurants, in retail stores and at public meetings. It exempted restaurants in hotels – City Council members reasoned that hotel restaurants catered to large numbers of visitors from abroad, where smoking is more acceptable than in the United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In 1990, the city of [[San Luis Obispo, California]], became the first city in the world to restrict indoor smoking in bars as well as restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tobacco.org/News/010129garth.html |author=David E.

In America, California's 1998 smoking ban encouraged other states such as New York to implement similar regulations. California's ban included a controversial restriction upon smoking in bars, extending the statewide ban enacted in 1994. As of April 2009 there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/mediaordlist.pdf |title=How many Smokefree Laws? |date=6 October 2006 |publisher=American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation |format=PDF |access-date=23 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas in California began banning smoking across whole cities, including every place except residential homes. More than 20 cities in California enacted park and beach smoking restrictions.

Since December 1993, in [[Peru]], it is illegal to smoke in any public enclosed places and any public transport vehicles (according to Law 25357 issued on 27 November 1991 and its regulations issued on 25 November 1993 by decree D.S.983-93-PCM). There is also legislation restricting publicity, and it is also illegal (Law 26957 21 May 1998) to sell tobacco to minors or directly advertise tobacco within 500m of schools (Law 26849 9 Jul 1997).

On 3 December 2003, [[New Zealand]] passed legislation to progressively implement a smoking ban in schools, school grounds, and workplaces by December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moh.govt.nz/smokefreelaw |author=Ministry of Health |title=Smokefree Law in New Zealand |publisher=moh.govt.nz |date=15 September 2005 |access-date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 29 March 2004, the [[Republic of Ireland]] implemented a nationwide ban on smoking in all workplaces. In Norway, similar legislation was put into force on 1 June the same year.

The Scottish ban on smoking in public areas was introduced on 26 March 2006 by the then Minister for Health and Community Care, [[Andy Kerr (Scottish politician)|Andy Kerr]]. Smoking was banned in all public places in the whole of the United Kingdom in 2007, when England became the final region to have the legislation come into effect (the age limit for buying tobacco was also raised from 16 to 18 on 1 October 2007).

{{anchor|KeralaSmokeBan}}On 12 July 1999, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in India banned smoking in public places by declaring "public smoking  as illegal first time in the history of whole world, unconstitutional  and violative of Article  21  of  the Constitution." The Bench, headed by  Dr.  Justice  K.  Narayana  Kurup,  held  that "tobacco smoking" in public places (in the form of  cigarettes, cigars, [[beedi]]es or otherwise) "falls within the mischief of the penal provisions relating to public nuisance as contained in  the Indian  Penal  Code and also the definition of air  pollution  as contained  in  the  statutes  dealing  with  the  protection  and preservation  of  the  environment,  in  particular,  the  Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act 1981."{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 2003, India introduced a law that banned smoking in public places like restaurants, public transport or schools.

In 2012, [[smoking in Costa Rica]] became subject to some of the most restrictive regulations in the world, being banned from many outdoor recreational and educational areas as well as public buildings and vehicles.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Total tobacco bans==
In 2004, [[Bhutan]] became the first country to completely outlaw the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco products. Penalties for violating the ban increased under the '[[Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010]]'. However, small allowances for personal possession are permitted as long as the possessor can prove that they have paid import duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parameswaran|first=Gayatri|title=Bhutan smokers huff and puff over tobacco ban|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/09/201292095920757761.html|website=aljazeera.com|publisher=Aljazeera|access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, [[Turkmenistan]] president [[Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov]] reportedly banned all tobacco sales in the country.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/this-entire-country-has-banned-smoking-a6816141.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pitcairn Islands]] had previously banned the sale of cigarettes; however, it now permits sales from a government-run store.

In March 2012, Brazil became the world's first country to ban all flavored tobacco, including menthols. It also banned the majority of the estimated 600 additives used, permitting only eight. This regulation applies to domestic and internationally imported cigarettes. Tobacco manufacturers had 18 months to remove the non-compliant cigarettes, 24 months to remove the other forms of non-compliant tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil - Flavoured cigarettes banned|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/implementation/news/news_brazil/en/|website=WHO FCTC|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Todd|title=Brazil's flavored cigarette ban now targeted|url=http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2012/04/brazils-flavored-cigarette-ban-now-targeted.html|website=citizen.typepad.com|publisher=Public Citizen|access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cigarette advertising==
In several parts of the world, tobacco advertising and sponsorship of sporting events is prohibited.  The ban upon tobacco advertising and sponsorship in the European Union in 2005 prompted [[Formula One]] management to look for venues that permit display of the [[Formula One sponsorship liveries|livery]] of tobacco sponsors, and led to some of the races on the calendar being cancelled in favor of more 'tobacco-friendly' markets.  As of 2007, only one Formula One team, [[Scuderia Ferrari]], received sponsorship from a tobacco company; [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] branding appeared on its cars in three races ([[2007 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain]], [[2007 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], and [[2007 Chinese Grand Prix|China]]), all in countries lacking restrictions on tobacco advertising.  Advertising billboards for tobacco are still in use in Germany, while  the majority of EU member states have outlawed them.

MotoGP team [[Ducati Marlboro]] received sponsorship from Marlboro, it's branding appearing at races in Qatar and China.
On 1 July 2009, Ireland prohibited the advertising and display of tobacco products in all retail outlets.

==Public support==
A 2007 Gallup poll found that 54% of Americans favoured completely smoke-free restaurants, 34% favoured completely smoke-free hotel rooms, and 29% favoured completely smoke-free bars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/28216/More-Smokers-Feeling-Harassed-Smoking-Bans.aspx More Smokers Feeling Harassed by Smoking Bans]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Gallup poll, of over 26,500 Europeans, conducted in December 2008, found that "a majority of EU citizens support smoking bans in public places, such as offices, restaurants and bars." The poll further found that "support for workplace smoking restrictions is slightly higher than support for such restrictions in restaurants (84% vs. 79%). Two-thirds support smoke-free bars, pubs and clubs." The support is highest in countries which have implemented clear smoking bans: "Citizens in Italy are the most prone to accept smoking restrictions in bars, pubs and clubs (93% – 87% "totally in favour"). Sweden and Ireland join Italy at the higher end of the scale with approximately 80% of respondents supporting smoke-free bars, pubs and clubs (70% in both countries is totally in favor)."&lt;ref name="2008-eu-poll"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_determinants/life_style/Tobacco/Documents/eb_253_en.pdf | title = Survey on Tobacco – Analytical Report | publisher=European Commission | author=The Gallup Organization | date = March 2009 | access-date=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of smoking bans==

===Effects upon health===
Several studies have documented health and economic benefits related to smoking bans. A 2009 report by the [[Institute of Medicine]] concluded that smoking bans reduced the risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks, but the report's authors were unable to identify the magnitude of this reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://iom.nationalacademies.org/Reports/2009/Secondhand-Smoke-Exposure-and-Cardiovascular-Effects-Making-Sense-of-the-Evidence.aspx | title=Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Cardiovascular Effects: Making Sense of the Evidence | publisher=Institute of Medicine | date=2009 | access-date=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://healthland.time.com/2012/10/30/smoke-free-laws-are-saving-lives/ | title=Smoke-Free Laws Are Saving Lives | website=Time | date=30 October 2012 | access-date=5 September 2015 | author=Blue, Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that bans on smoking in public places were associated with a significant reduction of incidence of heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyers DG, Neuberger JS, He J | title = Cardiovascular effect of bans on smoking in public places: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 54 | issue = 14 | pages = 1249–55 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19778665 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.07.022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead author of this meta-analysis, David Meyers, said that this review suggested that a nationwide ban on smoking in public places could prevent between 100,000 and 225,000 heart attacks in the United States each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/09/22/moh.healthmag.smoking.heart/ | title=Big drop in heart attacks after smoking bans, studies say | website=CNN | date=22 September 2009 | access-date=5 September 2015 | author=Tamkins, Theresa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislating on smoking of tobacco in public places has reduced the cause of heart disease among adults. Such legislations include banning smoking in restaurants, buses, hotels and workplaces. Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) found out that there are cardiovascular effects from exposure to secondhand smoke. An epidemiology report says that the risk of coronary heart disease is increased to around 25-30% when one is exposed to secondhand smoke. The data shows that even at low levels of the smoke, there is the risk and the risks increases with more exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nield-Gehrig|first=Jill S, Donald E.

A 2012 meta-analysis found that smoke-free legislation was associated with a lower rate of hospitalizations for cardiac, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases, and that "More comprehensive laws were associated with larger changes in risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan CE, Glantz SA | title = Association between smoke-free legislation and hospitalizations for cardiac, cerebrovascular, and respiratory diseases: a meta-analysis | journal = Circulation | volume = 126 | issue = 18 | pages = 2177–83 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23109514 | pmc = 3501404 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.112.121301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior author of this meta-analysis, [[Stanton Glantz]], told [[USA Today]] that, with respect to exemptions for certain facilities from smoking bans, "The politicians who put those exemptions in are condemning people to be put into the emergency room."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/29/smoking-bans-heart-attacks-strokes/1664193/ | title=Smoking bans cut number of heart attacks, strokes | website=USA Today | date=29 October 2012 | access-date=5 September 2015 | author=Szabo, Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 review found that smoking bans were associated with "significant reduction in acute MI [myocardial infarction] risk", but noted that “studies with smaller population in the United States usually reported larger reductions, while larger studies reported relatively modest reductions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin H, Wang H, Wu W, Lang L, Wang Q, Tian L | title = The effects of smoke-free legislation on acute myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 13 | pages = 529 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23721370 | pmc = 3671962 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-13-529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that smoke-free legislation was associated with approximately 10% reductions in [[preterm birth]]s and hospital attendance for asthma, but not with a decrease in [[low birth weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Been JV, Nurmatov UB, Cox B, Nawrot TS, van Schayck CP, Sheikh A | title = Effect of smoke-free legislation on perinatal and child health: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Lancet | volume = 383 | issue = 9928 | pages = 1549–60 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24680633 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60082-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-26770009 | title=Smoking bans cut asthma and premature births by 10%, study says | website=BBC News | date=28 March 2014 | access-date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 Cochrane review found that since the previous version of that review was published in 2010, the evidence that smoking bans improved health outcomes had become more robust, especially with respect to [[acute coronary syndrome]] admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/04/smoking-bans-reduce-harm-from-passive-smoking-study | title=Smoking bans reduce harm from passive smoking, study finds | website=The Guardian | date=4 February 2016 | access-date=4 February 2016 | author=Siddique, Haroon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frazer K, Callinan JE, McHugh J, van Baarsel S, Clarke A, Doherty K, Kelleher C | title = Legislative smoking bans for reducing harms from secondhand smoke exposure, smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD005992 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842828 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005992.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other studies came to the conclusion that smoking bans have little or no short-term effect on myocardial infarction rates and other diseases. A 2010 study from the US used huge nationally representative databases to comapare smoking-restricted areas with control areas and found no associations between smoking bans and short-term declines in heart attack rates. The authors have also analyzed smaller studies using subsamples and revealed that large short-term increases in myocardial infarction incidence following a smoking ban are as common as the large decreases.&lt;ref name="pmid21465828"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shetty KD, DeLeire T, White C, Bhattacharya J | title = Changes in U.S. hospitalization and mortality rates following smoking bans | journal = Journal of Policy Analysis and Management : [the Journal of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–28 | date = 2010 | pmid = 21465828 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects upon tobacco consumption===
Smoking bans are generally acknowledged to reduce rates of smoking; smoke-free workplaces reduce smoking rates among workers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans | year = 1999 | title = Do Workplace Smoking Bans Reduce Smoking? | journal = The American Economic Review | volume =  89| issue = 4| page = | jstor=117157 | pages=728–747 | doi=10.1257/aer.89.4.728|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and restrictions upon smoking in public places reduce general smoking rates through a combination of stigmatisation and reduction in the social cues for smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Do Smoking Bans Really Get People to Quit?, ABC World News, 8 November 2005, http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/QuitToLive/story?id=1292456&lt;/ref&gt; However, reports in the popular press after smoking bans have been enacted often present conflicting accounts as regards perceptions of effectiveness.

One report stated that cigarette sales in Ireland and Scotland increased after their smoking bans were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article601421.ece|title=Cigarette sales up 5% despite smoking ban | work=The Times | location=London | date=15 October 2006 | access-date=7 April 2010 | first=Eva | last=Langlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, another report states that in Ireland, cigarette sales fell by 16% in the six months after implementation of the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article2295859.ece|title=Cigarette sales drop 7% in a month | work=The Times | location=London | date=21 August 2007 | access-date=7 April 2010 | first=Robin | last=Pagnamenta}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, cigarette sales fell by 11% during July 2007, the first month of the nationwide smoking ban, compared with July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7023841.stm Cigarette sales 'slump after ban'] 2 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 document from [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]] summarised the tobacco industry's concern about the effects of smoking bans: "Total prohibition of smoking in the workplace strongly effects {{sic}} tobacco industry volume. Smokers facing these restrictions consume 11%–15% less than average and quit at a rate that is 84% higher than average."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/cgi/getdoc?tid=qhs55e00&amp;fmt=pdf&amp;ref=results|title=Impact of Workplace Restrictions on Consumption and Incidence|author=John Heironimus|date=21 January 1992|format=PDF|access-date=26 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the CDC reported a levelling-off of smoking rates in recent years despite a large number of ever more comprehensive smoking bans and large tax increases. It has also been suggested that a "backstop" of hardcore smokers has been reached: those unmotivated and increasingly defiant in the face of further legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110801094.html Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt; The smoking ban in New York City was credited with the reduction in adult smoking rates at nearly twice the rate as in the rest of the country, "and life expectancy has climbed three years in a decade".&lt;ref name=MichaelBloombergWants&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2154409,00.html#ixzz2huo6GjI5 Michael Sherer, "Michael Bloomberg Wants To Be Mayor of the World," ''Time,'' 21 October 2013, pages 20-31]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoking restrictions may make it easier for smokers to quit. A survey suggests 22% of UK smokers may have considered quitting in response to that nation's smoking ban.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4781732.stm A fifth of smokers 'plan to quit'] 8 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Restaurant smoking restrictions may help to stop young people from becoming habitual smokers. A study of Massachusetts youths, found that those in towns with smoking bans were 35 percent less likely to be habitual smokers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19826552.900-restaurant-smoking-bans-stop-teens-getting-the-habit.html Restaurant smoking bans stop teens getting the habit]  ''New Scientist'' Issue 2655, 10 May 2008, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siegel M, Albers AB, Cheng DM, Hamilton WL, Biener L | title = Local restaurant smoking regulations and the adolescent smoking initiation process: results of a multilevel contextual analysis among Massachusetts youth | journal = Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine | volume = 162 | issue = 5 | pages = 477–83 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18458195 | pmc = 2948204 | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.162.5.477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects upon businesses===

Many studies have been published in the health industry literature on the economic effect of smoking bans. The majority of these government and academic studies have found that there is no negative economic impact associated with smoking restrictions and many findings that there may be a positive effect on local businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eriksen M, Chaloupka F | title = The economic impact of clean indoor air laws | journal = Ca | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 367–78 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17989131 | doi = 10.3322/CA.57.6.367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 review of 97 such studies of the economic effects of a smoking ban on the hospitality industry found that the "best-designed" studies concluded that smoking bans did not harm businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scollo M, Lal A, Hyland A, Glantz S | title = Review of the quality of studies on the economic effects of smoke-free policies on the hospitality industry | journal = Tobacco Control | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–20 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12612356 | pmc = 1759095 | doi = 10.1136/tc.12.1.13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2014 meta-analysis found no significant gains or losses in revenue in restaurants and bars affected by smoking bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cornelsen L, McGowan Y, Currie-Murphy LM, Normand C | title = Systematic review and meta-analysis of the economic impact of smoking bans in restaurants and bars | journal = Addiction | volume = 109 | issue = 5 | pages = 720–7 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24529192 | doi = 10.1111/add.12486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies funded by the bar and restaurant associations have sometimes claimed that smoking bans have a negative effect on restaurant and bar profits. Such associations have also criticised studies which found that such legislation had no impact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081001202848/http://www.tlw.org/public/content/Documents/Smoking%20Ban/Economic_Impacts.pdf "Economic impacts"] Tavern League of Wisconsin (broken link)&lt;/ref&gt; Many bar and restaurant associations have relationships with the tobacco industry and are sponsored by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dearlove JV, Bialous SA, Glantz SA | title = Tobacco industry manipulation of the hospitality industry to maintain smoking in public places | journal = Tobacco Control | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–104 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12034999 | pmc = 1763854 | doi = 10.1136/tc.11.2.94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
A government survey in Sydney found that the proportion of the population attending pubs and clubs rose after smoking was banned inside them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/no-smoke-signals-a-boom-for-pubs-clubs/2007/09/01/1188067429767.html |title=No smoke signals a boom for pubs, clubs |work=Sydney Morning Herald |access-date=1 September 2007 | date=2 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a ClubsNSW report in August 2008 blamed the smoking ban for New South Wales clubs suffering their worst fall in income ever, amounting to a decline of $385&amp;nbsp;million. Income for clubs was down 11% in New South Wales. Sydney CBD club income fell 21.7% and western Sydney clubs lost 15.5%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/story/0,668,24111832-2702,00.html{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
Some smoking restrictions were introduced in German hotels, restaurants, and bars in 2008 and early 2009. The restaurant industry has claimed that some businesses in the states which restricted smoking in late 2007 ([[Lower Saxony]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], and [[Hesse]]n) experienced reduced profits. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) claimed that the smoking ban deterred people from going out for a drink or meal, stating that 15% of establishments that adopted a ban in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3058044,00.html/ Germany's Smoking Ban Spreads Through States, ''Deutsche Welle'', 14 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) finds negative impacts on revenues, if any, only in the very short run. In the medium and long run, a recovery of revenues took place. These results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahlfeldt|first1=Gabriel M.|last2=Maennig|first2=Wolfgang | name-list-format = vanc |title=Impact of Non-Smoking Ordinances on Hospitality Revenues: The Case of Germany|journal=Hamburg Contemporary Economic Discussion Paper No. 26|date=2009|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1520573|ssrn=1520573|hdl=10419/42235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking is not permitted in any public transit or in or around railway stations except for the locations expressly indicated for smoking. Smoking on trains was banned completely by the [[Deutsche Bahn AG]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/germanys-deutsche-bahn-trains-to-become-smoke-]&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking has been restricted in airports and all [[Lufthansa]] planes since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.e-sheesh.com/up_in_smoke.html?_s=PM:TRAVEL |work=CNN |title=Nudity, cartoons grab air travelers' attention |date=31 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195527/http://www.e-sheesh.com/up_in_smoke.html?_s=PM%3ATRAVEL |archive-date=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006 FIFA World cup]] which the country hosted was the last one before bans on smoking in cafes, bars and restaurants were introduced in most of the countries around the world.

In 2008, [[Bavaria]] became the first federal state of Germany to completely ban smoking in bars and restaurants. After this restriction was criticized as being "too harsh" by some members of the governing party [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]], it was relaxed one year later. Supporters of smoking bans then brought about a public referendum on the issue, which led to even firmer restrictions than the initial ban. Thereafter, a more comprehensive ban was introduced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100704-28287.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, the [[Saarland]] became the second federal state with a complete ban in bars and restaurants.

In 2013, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany's most populous federal state, became the third state with a strict ban in bars and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/20130430/49447]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the first country to introduce fully smoke-free workplaces (March 2004). The Irish workplace smoke-free law was introduced with the intention of protecting workers from [[second-hand smoke]] and to discourage smoking in a nation with a high percentage of smokers. In Ireland, the main opposition to the ban came from publicans. Many pubs introduced "outdoor" arrangements (generally heated areas with shelters). It was speculated by opponents that the smoke-free workplaces law would increase the amount of drinking and smoking in the home, but recent studies showed this was not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hyland A, Higbee C, Hassan L, Fong GT, Borland R, Cummings KM, Hastings G | title = Does smoke-free Ireland have more smoking inside the home and less in pubs than the United Kingdom? Findings from the international tobacco control policy evaluation project | journal = European Journal of Public Health | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–5 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 17569698 | doi = 10.1093/eurpub/ckm054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ireland's Office of Tobacco Control website indicates that "an evaluation of the official hospitality sector data shows there has been no adverse economic effect from the introduction of this measure (the March 2004 national introduction of smoke-free in bars, restaurants, etc). It has been claimed that the smoke-free law was a significant contributing factor to the closure of hundreds of small rural pubs, with almost 440 fewer licences renewed in 2006 than in 2005."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1443931.ece|title=Rural pubs will suffer from smoking ban | work=The Times | location=London | date=27 February 2007 | access-date=7 April 2010 | first=David | last=Lister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Isle of Man====
Smoke-free restrictions came into effect in the [[Isle of Man]] on 30 March 2008.

====India====
[[Chandigarh]] became the first city-state of India to become smoke-free in July 2007. Social activist [[Hemant Goswami]] did pioneering work to make Chandigarh smoke-free. Inspired by the success of Chandigarh, the then Union Health Minister Dr. Ambumani Ramadoss enacted the new smoke-free regulation in 2008. India banned smoking in public places on 2 October 2008. Nearly a decade earlier, on 12 July 1999, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in India banned smoking in public places by declaring public smoking as illegal (the first time in the world), unconstitutional, and violative of Article 21 of the constitution. The bench headed by Dr. Justice K. Narayana Kurup, held that tobacco smoking in public places (in the form of cigarettes, cigars, beedies or otherwise) falls within the mischief of the penal provisions relating to public nuisance as contained in the Indian Penal Code and within the definition of air pollution as contained in the statutes dealing with protection and preservation of environment, in particular, Prevention and Control of Pollution Act 1981.
The Supreme Court in Murli S Deora vs. Union of India and Ors., recognized the harmful effects of smoking in public and also the effect on passive smokers, and in the absence of statutory provisions at that time, prohibited smoking in public places such as,1.auditoriums, 2. hospital buildings, 3. health institutions, 4. educational institutions, 5. libraries, 6. court buildings, 7. public office, 8. public conveyances, including the railways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cehat.org/humanrights/caselaws.pdf|title=Environment and Health by Adv.

Deora vs Union Of India And Ors on 2 November 2001}}

====Philippines====
The smoking ban in the Philippines is under the provisions of two laws: the Clean Air Act of 1999 and the Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003.

The Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999 prohibits smoking inside a public building or an enclosed public place including public vehicles and other means of transport or in any enclosed area outside of one’s private residence, private place of work or any duly designated smoking area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/philippinecleanairact.htm#.U8yltOOSz4U|title=The Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999|publisher=Chan Robles Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Republic Act No. 9211:Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003}}
The Tobacco Regulation Act also prohibits smoking in public places, like schools, public transportation terminals, malls, and places with [[fire hazard]]s, like gas stations.

Cancer survivors support the planned smoking ban in order for local government units to strictly implement the regulations set by the Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cancer victims hopeful of nationwide smoking ban|url=http://interaksyon.com/article/128691/cancer-victims-hopeful-of-nationwide-smoking-ban|access-date=June 10, 2016|work=Interaksyon|agency=[[News5]]|date=June 6, 2016|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607113712/http://interaksyon.com/article/128691/cancer-victims-hopeful-of-nationwide-smoking-ban|archive-date=7 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] signed an [[Philippine Executive Order 26|executive order]] for the disestablishment of public smoking areas, both indoor and outdoor, implementing a nationwide smoking ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte signs EO on nationwide smoking ban|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/897641/duterte-signs-eo-on-smoking-ban|access-date=May 18, 2017|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poland====
Smoking in public places was banned in Poland on 15 November 2010 by a change in parliamentary act "On Defending Health Against Results of Tobacco and Tobacco Products Usage" (''Ustawa o ochronie zdrowia przed następstwami używania tytoniu i wyrobów tytoniowych'').&lt;ref name="sejm"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =[[Sejm]] | date =15 November 2010 | title =Ustawa o ochronie zdrowia przed następstwami używania tytoniu i wyrobów tytoniowych | journal =[[Dziennik Ustaw]] | volume = | issue =10 | page =55 | issn =0867-3411 | url =http://zakaz-palenia.pl/ustawa.php | format = | access-date =10 August 2012 | language =pl | deadurl =yes | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120126044847/http://zakaz-palenia.pl/ustawa.php | archive-date =26 January 2012 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The smoke ban includes all public places, regardless of ownership, that is restaurants, pubs, workplaces, hospitals, universities, public transport stops and stations and sports facilities (institutions of primary and secondary education had been declared smoke-free already in 1996).&lt;ref name="sejm"/&gt; The fine for violating the ban is up to 500 [[Polish złoty]].&lt;ref name="sejm"/&gt; Owners of businesses who fail to put up no smoking signs could be penalised with a fine of up to 2000 złoty, while tobacco producers who advertise their products as "less harmful" or "healthier" could be fined with up to 200000 złoty.&lt;ref name="sejm"/&gt;

However, after two years in effect the ban did not affect the number of active smokers in Poland. According to a 2012 poll by [[Centre for Public Opinion Research|CBOS]], both before the ban and 2 years later the percentage of smoking Poles was exactly the same: 31.&lt;ref name="cbos-gw"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =fp, [[Polish Press Agency|PAP]] (corporate author) | date =9 August 2012 | title =Dwa lata zakazu palenia.

====Russia====
Russia was one of the last countries in the world not to have anti-smoking legislation in place.  However, in October 2012, [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] commenced an anti-tobacco strategy that has led to proposals from the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Russian Health Ministry]] to cease advertising, increase tax on cigarette sales and ban smoking in public spaces.&lt;ref name=TEL&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9614102/Russia-launches-smoking-crackdown.html| title=Russia launches smoking crackdown  | author=Telegraph | publisher=Telegraph | date=17 October 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister lamented the smoking death rate in the country with 400,000 citizens dying every year of smoking-related causes and this is also compounded by the fact that a pack of cigarettes in Russia typically costs around the £1 mark.&lt;ref name=TEL /&gt;

A strict law aimed to protect people’s health from tobacco smoke and the consequences of smoking that introduced a ban on smoking in all closed public areas in compliance with the WHO [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] took effect on 1 June 2013. At first smoking ban abusers were not fined - the mechanism was still under consideration. The law prohibits smoking at schools and universities, cultural and sporting organizations, beaches, stadiums, on playgrounds and in hospitals, in sanatoriums and at health resorts, inside the offices of public organizations and at filling stations. Smoking is banned aboard aircraft, on the [[subway (rail)|subway]] and all kinds of public transport. From 15 November 2013 on, smoking at working places, near and within the educational, cultural, sporting and healthcare organizations, in houses’ hallways, at railway stations and airports is to be punished with a fine from 500 to 1,500 roubles ($15 – 45.5). The management of organizations where the ban is violated will face tougher fines. From 1 June 2014 the list will be complemented with restaurants and bars, [[dormitories]], [[hotel]]s, long-haul trains, and the boarding platforms of suburban [[railway station]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://en.itar-tass.com/opinions/1607| title =Smoking ban not effective thus far| website =[[ITAR TASS]]| access-date = 14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
No-smoking regulations came into effect in Scotland on 26 March 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/|title=Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Wales on 2 April 2007, in Northern Ireland on 30 April 2007 and in England on 1 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6410215.stm|title=Third of pubs 'not ready for ban' | work=BBC News | date=2 March 2007 | access-date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was cited as an example of good regulation which has had a favourable impact on the UK economy by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file53251.pdf |title=Better regulation,  Better Benefits: Getting the Balance Right.

Six months after implementation in Wales, the Licensed Victuallers Association (LVA), which represents pub operators across Wales, claimed that pubs had lost up to 20% of their trade. The LVA said some businesses were on the brink of closure, others had already closed down, and there was little optimism trade would eventually return to previous levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/news/wales-news/2007/10/12/smoking-ban-has-hit-trade-says-lva-91466-19938086/|title=ic Wales (icwales.icnetwork.co.uk)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Beer and Pub Association]] (BBPA), which represents some pubs and breweries across the UK claimed that beer sales were at their lowest level since the 1930s, ascribing a fall in sales of 7% during 2007 to the smoke-free regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7102937.stm Pub beer sales slump to low point] 20 November 2007, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey conducted by pub and bar trade magazine ''The Publican'', the anticipated increase in sales of food following introduction of smoke-free workplaces did not immediately occur. The trade magazine's survey of 303 pubs in the United Kingdom found the average customer spent £14.86 on food and drink at dinner in 2007, virtually identical to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20080641294269 Smoke Ban Fails To Boost Pub Meal Sales] 26 November 2007, SKY News {{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by [[British Institute of Innkeeping|BII]] (formerly British Institute of Innkeeping) and the Federation of Licensed Victuallers' Associations (FLVA) concluded that sales had decreased by 7.3% in the 5 months since the introduction of smoke-free workplaces on 1 July 2007. Of the 2,708 responses to the survey, 58% of licensees said they had seen smokers visiting less regularly, while 73% had seen their smoking customers spending less time at the pub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7147786.stm Smoking ban 'costs pub takings'] 17 December 2007, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
{{main|List of smoking bans in the United States}}
In the US, smokers and hospitality businesses initially argued that businesses would suffer from no-smoking laws. However, a 2006 review by the [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]] found that smoking restrictions were unlikely to harm businesses in practice, and that many restaurants and bars might see increased business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General | url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke | access-date=27 June 2006 | deadurl=yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703030637/http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/ | archive-date=3 July 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Richard Roesler: Surgeon general: No safe level of secondhand smoke. | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/06/27/involuntary.smoking.ap/index.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713070715/http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/06/27/involuntary.smoking.ap/index.html | archive-date=13 July 2006 | access-date=27 June 2006 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, New York City amended its smoke-free law to include virtually  all restaurants and bars, including those in private clubs, making it, along with the California smoke-free law, one of the toughest in the United States. The city's Department of Health found in a 2004 study that air pollution levels had decreased sixfold in bars and restaurants after the restrictions went into effect, and that New Yorkers had reported less second-hand smoke in the workplace. The study also found the city's restaurants and bars prospered despite the smoke-free law, with increases in jobs, liquor licenses, and business tax payments. The president of the New York Nightlife Association remarked that the study was not wholly representative, as by not differentiating between restaurants and nightclubs, the reform may have caused businesses like nightclubs and bars to suffer instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE2D91E30F93AA15750C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=health Bars and Restaurants Thrive Amid Smoking Ban, Study Says] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621121327/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE2D91E30F93AA15750C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=health |date=21 June 2008 }} 29 March 2003, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study by the New York State Department of Health found that "the CIAA has not had any significant negative financial effect on restaurants and bars in either the short or the long term".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Engelen, Matthew Farrelly &amp; Andrew Hyland: ''[http://www.health.state.ny.us/prevention/tobacco_control/docs/ciaa_impact_report.pdf The Health and Economic Impact of New York's Clean Indoor Air Act].''

In May 2011 New York City expanded the previously implemented smoking ban by banning smoking in parks, beaches and boardwalks, public golf courses and other areas controlled by the New York&lt;ref&gt;http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/TobaccoFreeIreland.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/TobaccoFreeIreland.pdf|title=Tobacco Free Ireland|last=Of Health|first=Department|date=2013|website=Department of health|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  City Parks Department. On 30 October 2013, the city council agreed to raise the age to buy any kind of tobacco and even electronic cigarettes from 18 years of age to 21 years of age. In the United States, a small number of cities, including New York and suburbs of Boston such as [[Needham, Massachusetts]], have 21 years of age as the minimum age to purchase cigarettes; in most other areas the legal age is 18 or 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/nyregion/new-york-approves-law-to-raise-tobacco-purchasing-age-to-21.html |title=New York Raising Age to Buy Cigarettes to 21 |date=30 October 2013 | work=The New York Times |first=Anemona |last=Hartocollis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quinn|first1=Colleen|title=Nearly a dozen Massachusetts towns raise age for cigarette sales|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/2013/12/nearly_a_dozen_massachusetts_towns_raise_age_for_cigarette_s.html|access-date=4 September 2014|work=Boston.com|agency=State House News Service|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using sales and tobacco tax data from 216 cities and counties over 11 years, the researchers projected that seven of the states would have no economic impact, and West Virginia would see a 1 percent boost in restaurant jobs if a statewide smoking ban was adopted. Other benefits of smoking bans in bars and restaurants include improved lung function and a decrease in smoking rates among staff. Some data came from the Missouri Department of Revenue after smoking bans were passed in Lake Saint Louis, Kirkwood, Clayton and Ballwin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/health/smoking-ban-would-not-hurt-state-s-bars-and-restaurants/article_17dc2c01-b068-5f0e-9f28-2bc2748e02bc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects upon musical instruments===
Bellows-driven instruments – such as the [[accordion]], [[concertina]], [[Diatonic button accordion|melodeon]] and (Irish) [[Uilleann pipes|Uilleann]] bagpipes – reportedly need less frequent cleaning and maintenance as a result of the Irish smoke-free law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haw SJ, Gruer L | title = Changes in exposure of adult non-smokers to secondhand smoke after implementation of smoke-free legislation in Scotland: national cross sectional survey | journal = BMJ | volume = 335 | issue = 7619 | pages = 549 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17827485 | pmc = 1976488 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39315.670208.47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Third-hand smoke", solid particulates from secondhand smoke that are adsorbed onto surfaces and later re-emitted as gases or transferred through touch, are a particular problem for musicians.  After playing in smoky bars, instruments can emit nicotine, 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP), phenol, cresols, naphthalene, formaldehyde, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (including some not found in freshly emitted tobacco smoke), which can enter musicians' bodies through the skin, or be re-emitted as gases after they have left the smoky environment. Concern about third-hand smoke on instruments is one of the reasons many musicians, represented by the New Orleans Musicians' Clinic, supported the smoking ban there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthcarejournalno.com/the-journal/hjno-contents-index/features/2288-clearing-the-air |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120015349/http://www.healthcarejournalno.com/the-journal/hjno-contents-index/features/2288-clearing-the-air |archive-date=20 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of Quebec, all Canadian provinces have banned smoking indoors and outdoors in all their prison facilities. Prison officials and guards are sometimes worried due to previous events in other prisons concerning riots, fostering a cigarette black market within the prison, and other problems resulting from total prison smoking restrictions. Prisons have experienced riots when placing smoking restrictions into effect resulting in prisoners setting fires, destroying prison property, persons being assaulted, injured, and stabbed. One prison in Canada had some guards reporting breathing difficulties from the fumes of prisoners smoking artificial cigarettes made from nicotine patches lit by creating sparks from inserting metal objects into electrical outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smokersclubinc.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=723 The Smokers Club, Inc. – Prison Ban Casualty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095528/http://www.smokersclubinc.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=723 |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libcom.org/news/prisoner-riot-reverses-smoking-ban-09022008 Prisoner riot reverses smoking ban | libcom.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example in 2008, the Orsainville Detention Centre near Quebec City, withdrew its smoke-free provision following a riot. But the feared increase in tension and violence expected in association with smoking restrictions has generally not been experienced in practice.&lt;ref name="tbcontrol" /&gt;

Prison smoking bans are also in force in New Zealand, the Isle of Man and the Australian states of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Northern Territory and New South Wales. The New Zealand ban was subsequently successfully challenged in court on two occasions, resulting in a law change to maintain it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10855888|title=Prison smokes ban ruled unlawful|first=Andrew|last=Koubaridis|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10894606|title=Tobacco victory goes up in a puff of smoke|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=4 July 2013|access-date=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of smoke-free laws==
Smoke-free regulations and ordinances have been criticised on a number of grounds.

===Government interference with personal lifestyle===
Critics of smoke-free provisions, including musician [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Official Website of Joe Jackson | url=http://www.joejackson.com/smoking.php | access-date=12 April 2007 | deadurl=yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421023443/http://www.joejackson.com/smoking.php | archive-date=21 April 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and political essayist [[Christopher Hitchens]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectator.org/archives/2005/06/23/smoking-room The American Spectator : Smoking Room&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323063246/http://spectator.org/archives/2005/06/23/smoking-room |date=23 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/14/health.smoking | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Is the smoking ban a good idea? | first=Simon | last=Hoggart | date=18 May 2007 | access-date=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have claimed that regulation efforts are misguided. Typically, such arguments are based upon an interpretation of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s [[harm principle]] which perceives smoke-free laws as an obstacle to tobacco consumption per se, rather than a bar upon harming other people.

Such arguments, which usually refer to the notion of personal liberty, have themselves been criticised by [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] who defended smoke-free regulations on several grounds.&lt;ref name="AmartyaSen"/&gt; Among other things, Sen argued that while a person may be free to acquire the habit of smoking, they thereby restrict their own freedom in the future given that the habit of smoking is hard to break.&lt;ref name="AmartyaSen"/&gt; Sen also pointed out the heavy costs that smoking inevitably imposes on every society which grants smokers unrestricted access to public services (which, Sen noted, every society that is not "monstrously unforgiving" would do).&lt;ref name="AmartyaSen"/&gt; Arguments which invoke the notion of personal liberty against smoke-free laws are thus incomplete and inadequate, according to Sen.&lt;ref name="AmartyaSen"&gt;{{cite news |title=Unrestrained smoking is a libertarian half-way house |first=Amartya |last=Sen |authorlink=Amartya Sen |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=11 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, two psychiatrist patients and a nurse took their local district health board to court, arguing a smoking ban at intensive care units violated "human dignity" as they were there for mental health reasons, not smoking-related illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Smoking-ban-may-harm-psychiatric-patients--lawyer/tabid/423/articleID/298429/Default.aspx| work=3 News NZ| title= Lawyer: smoking ban may harm patients| date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued it was "cruel" to deny patients cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/135602/smoking-ban-cruel-to-psychiatric-patients,-court-told| work=3 News NZ| title= Smoking ban cruel to psychiatric patients, court told| date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property rights===

Some critics of smoke-free laws emphasise the property rights of business owners, drawing a distinction between nominally public places (such as government buildings) and privately owned establishments (such as bars and restaurants). Citing economic efficiency, some economists suggest that the basic institutions of private property rights and contractual freedom are capable of resolving conflicts between the preferences of smokers and those who seek a smoke-free environment, without government intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iedm.org/uploaded/pdf/avril05_en.pdf|title=Valentin Petkantchin, "Should cigarettes be banned in public places?" (Montreal Economic Institute: April, 2005)|format=PDF|access-date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on existing smoke-free businesses===
Many critics, including a substantial number of those who oppose smoking bans on property-rights grounds,{{who|date=July 2017}} note that where no private-establishment smoking bans are in place, a subset of establishments are able to set themselves apart by catering to the [[Niche market|market niche]] of patrons who prefer smoke-free establishments. Prohibiting smoking in all areas, these critics argue, would eliminate the competitive advantage of these establishments.

===Legality of smoke-free regulations===
Businesses affected by smoke-free regulations have filed lawsuits claiming that these are unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. In the United States, some cite unequal protection under the law while others cite loss of business without compensation, as well as other types of challenges. Some localities where hospitality businesses filed lawsuits against the State or local government include, [[Nevada]], [[Montana]], [[Iowa]], [[Colorado]], [[Kentucky]], New York, [[South Carolina]], and  Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegasnow.com/Global/story.asp?s=5973819 Judge Rules Nevada Smoking Ban is Constitutional – Las Vegas Now |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224204843/http://www.lasvegasnow.com/Global/story.asp?s=5973819 |date=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montanagaminggroup.com/index.php/fuseaction/topic.subcontent/page/74/parentPage/6 Montana Gaming Group, effect of public smoking ban on Montana businesses | smoking ban in public areas|Helena Montana smoking ban|environmental tobacco smoke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824232600/http://www.montanagaminggroup.com/index.php/fuseaction/topic.subcontent/page/74/parentPage/6 |date=24 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/article_1cfc8165-bc06-551c-9fa3-7b5e4977493b.html Seven businesses sue over smoking ban&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2007/Jan/31/ln/FP701310383.html Anti-smoking law challenged | The Honolulu Advertiser|Hawaii's Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220730/http://no-smoking.org/june06/06-23-06-4.html Colorado AG Asks State Smoking Ban Lawsuit Be Dismissed [06/23/06-4&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlky.com/news/10317827/detail.html?rss=lou&amp;psp=news Lawsuit Challenges Louisville's Smoking Ban – Louisville News Story – WLKY Louisville&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717065550/http://www.wlky.com/news/10317827/detail.html?rss=lou&amp;psp=news |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;pwst=1&amp;q=smoking+ban+lawsuit+loss&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N smoking ban lawsuit loss – Google Search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13825459.html Health board stands by smoking ban,: Lawsuit alleges group overstepped its authority | Article from Charleston Gazette|HighBeam Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smoke-free laws may move smoking elsewhere===
Restrictions upon smoking in offices and other enclosed public places often result in smokers going outside to smoke, frequently congregating outside doorways.

In January 2010, the mayor of Boston, Massachusetts, [[Thomas Menino]], proposed a restriction upon smoking inside public housing apartments under the jurisdiction of the Boston Housing Authority.&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, Colneth, Jr., [http://bostonherald.com/news/regional/view.bg?articleid=1229476 "Puffers fuming over planned ban"], ''Boston Herald'', Sunday, 31 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fermin, Marisela, [http://sparechangenews.net/news/not-here-you-don%E2%80%99t-plans-ban-smoking-boston-public-housing "Not in Here You Don’t: Plans to Ban Smoking in Boston Public Housing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318013258/http://www.sparechangenews.net/news/not-here-you-don%E2%80%99t-plans-ban-smoking-boston-public-housing |date=18 March 2011 }}, ''[[Spare Change News]]'', Boston, 25 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection to DUI fatalities===
In May 2008, research published by Adams and Cotti in the ''Journal of Public Economics'' examined statistics of drunken-driving fatalities and accidents in areas where smoke-free laws have been implemented in bars and found that fatal drunken-driving accidents increased by about 13%, or about 2.5 such accidents per year for a typical county of 680,000. They speculate this could be caused by smokers driving farther away to jurisdictions without smoke-free laws or where enforcement is lax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10966152|title=Drunk driving after the passage of smoking bans in bars | work=The Economist | date=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of funding on research literature ===
As in other areas of research, the effect of funding on research literature has been discussed with respect to smoke-free laws. Most commonly, studies which found few or no positive and/or negative effects of smoke-free laws and which were funded by tobacco companies have been delegitimised because they were seen as biased in favor of their funders.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. mentioned on p. 167 in [http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-4-issue-3-september-2007] ''Econ Journal Watch'', Volume 5, Number 2, pp. 163–168. Retrieved 19 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Economics at the California State Polytechnic University-San Luis Obispo, [[Michael L. Marlow]], defended "tobacco-sponsored" studies arguing that all studies merited "scrutiny and a degree of skepticism", irrespective of their funding. He wished for the basic assumption that every author were "fair minded and trustworthy, and deserves being heard out" and for less attention to research funding when evaluating the results of a study. Marlow suggests that studies funded by tobacco companies are viewed and dismissed as "deceitful",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marlow Michael L | year = 2008 | title = Honestly, Who Else Would Fund Such Research?

==Alternatives to smoke-free laws==

===Incentives for voluntarily smoke-free establishments===
During the debates over the Washington, DC, smoke-free law, city council member [[Carol Schwartz]] proposed legislation that would have enacted either a substantial tax credit for businesses that chose to voluntarily restrict smoking or a quadrupling of the annual business license fee for bars, restaurants and clubs that wished to allow smoking. Additionally, locations allowing smoking would have been required to install specified high-performance ventilation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/SCHWARTZ/smoke-free_workplaces_statement_june14_2005_rls.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419094903/http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/SCHWARTZ/smoke-free_workplaces_statement_june14_2005_rls.htm |archive-date=19 April 2008 |title=Press Advisory – Statement of Councilmember Carol Schwartz at the 14 June 2005 Smoke-Free Hearing |website=|date=14 June 2005 |access-date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventilation===
Critics of smoke-free laws have suggested that ventilation is a means of reducing the harmful effects of [[second-hand smoke]]. A tobacco industry-funded study conducted by the School of Technology of the [[University of Glamorgan]] in Wales, published in the Building Services Journal suggested that "ventilation is effective in controlling the level of contamination", although "ventilation can only dilute or partially displace contaminants and occupational exposure limits are based on the 'as low as reasonably practicable' principle".&lt;ref&gt;Cited at parliament.uk. "[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhealth/485/48506.htm Dealing with the health effects of secondhand smoke]". Retrieved 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cited at parliament.uk. "[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhealth/485/485iwe14.htm COMMENTARY ON STUDIES CARRIED OUT BY DR ANDREW GEENS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GLAMORGAN SCHOOL OF TECHNOLOGY]". Retrieved 29 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some hospitality organisations have claimed that ventilation systems could bring venues into line with smoke-free restaurant ordinances. A study published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers and funded by the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] found one establishment with lower air quality in the non-smoking section, due to improperly installed ventilation systems. They also determined that even properly functioning systems "are not substitutes for smoking bans in controlling environmental smoke exposure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rwjf.org/pr/product.jsp?id=15600|title=Can Displacement Ventilation Control Secondhand ETS?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco industry has focused on proposing ventilation as an alternative to smoke-free laws, though this approach has not been widely adopted in the U.S. because "in the end, it is simpler, cheaper, and healthier to end smoking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/tc.2003.004101 |title=Tobacco industry efforts to present ventilation as an alternative to smoke-free environments in North America |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=13 |issue=90001 |pages=41i–47 |year=2004 |last1=Drope |first1=J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian smoke-free law ban permits dedicated smoking rooms with automatic doors and smoke extractors. Nevertheless, few Italian establishments are creating smoking rooms due to the additional cost.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4159587.stm Italians fume over cigarette curb] 10 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark report from the U.S. Surgeon General found that even the use of elaborate ventilation systems and smoking rooms fail to provide protection from the health hazards of [[second-hand smoke]], since there is "no safe level of second-hand smoke".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ''[http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/secondhandsmoke/ The Health Consequesnces of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General].'' U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coordinating Center for Health Promotion, National Center for Chronic Disease prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2006. Retrieved 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preemption==
A number of states in the United States have "preemption clauses" within state law which block local communities from passing smoke-free ordinances more strict than the state laws on the books. The rationale is to prevent local communities from passing smoke-free ordinances which are viewed as excessive by that state's legislature. Other states have "anti-preemption clauses" that allow local communities to pass smoking ban ordinances that their legislature found unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06357/748507-85.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Allegheny County smoking ban put on hold | first1=Gabrielle | last1=Banks | first2=Anita | last2=Srikameswaran | name-list-format = vanc | date=23 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardship exemptions==
In [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin]], three restaurants received short-term exemptions from a local smoke-free ordinance in restaurants when they managed to demonstrate financial suffering because of it.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
A '''standard form contract''' (sometimes referred to as a '''contract of adhesion,''' a leonine contract, a take-it-or-leave-it contract, or a '''[[boilerplate text|boilerplate]] contract''') is a [[contract]] between two parties, where the terms and conditions of the contract are set by one of the parties, and the other party has little or no ability to negotiate more favorable terms and is thus placed in a "take it or leave it" position.

While these types of contracts are not illegal ''per se'', there exists a very real possibility for [[unconscionability]].  In addition, in the event of an ambiguity, such ambiguity will be resolved ''[[contra proferentem]]'' against the party drafting the contract language.

==Theoretical issues==
There is much debate on a theoretical level whether, and to what extent, courts should enforce standard form contracts.

On one hand, they undeniably fulfill an important role of promoting economic efficiency. Standard form contracting reduces [[transaction cost]]s substantially by precluding the need for buyers and sellers of goods and services to negotiate the many details of a sale contract each time the product is sold.

On the other hand, there is the potential for inefficient, and even unjust, terms to be accepted by signatories to these contracts. Such terms might be seen as unjust if they allow the seller to avoid all liability or unilaterally modify terms or terminate the contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/fta1999117/s32x.html Download Menu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508220916/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/fta1999117/s32x.html |date=2007-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms often come in the form of, but are not limited to, forum selection clauses and mandatory arbitration clauses, which can limit or foreclose a party's access to the courts; and also liquidated damages clauses, which set a limit to the amount that can be recovered or require a party to pay a specific amount. They might be inefficient if they place the risk of a negative outcome, such as defective manufacturing, on the buyer who is not in the best position to take precautions.

There are a number of reasons why such terms might be accepted:&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=287819 Standard-Form Contracting in the Electronic Age by Robert A. Hillman, Jeffrey J. Rachlinski :: SSRN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041115065726/http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=287819 |date=2004-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1105424 The Devil in the Details: The Interrelationship Among Citizenship, Rule of Law and Form-Adhesive Contracts by Zev J. Eigen :: SSRN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307203800/http://ssrn.com/abstract=1105424 |date=2011-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Standard form contracts are rarely read: Lengthy boilerplate terms are often in [[fine print]] and written in complicated legal language which often seems irrelevant. The prospect of a buyer finding any useful information from reading such terms is correspondingly low. Even if such information is discovered, the consumer is in no position to bargain as the contract is presented on a “take it or leave it” basis. Coupled with the often large amount of time needed to read the terms, the expected payoff from reading the contract is low and few people would be expected to read it.
;Access to the full terms may be difficult or impossible before acceptance: Often the document being signed is not the full contract; the purchaser is told that the rest of the terms are in another location. This reduces the likelihood of the terms being read and in some situations, such as [[software license agreement]]s, can only be read after they have been notionally accepted by purchasing the good and opening the box.  These contracts are typically not enforced, since common law dictates that ''all'' terms of a contract must be disclosed ''before'' the contract is executed.
;Boilerplate terms are not salient: The most important terms to purchasers of a good are generally the price and the quality, which are generally understood before the contract of adhesion is signed. Terms relating to events which have very small probabilities of occurring or which refer to particular statutes or legal rules do not seem important to the purchaser. This further lowers the chance of such terms being read and also means they are likely to be ignored even if they are read.
;There may be social pressure to sign: Standard form contracts are signed at a point when the main details of the transaction have either been negotiated or explained. Social pressure to conclude the bargain at that point may come from a number of sources. The salesperson may imply that the purchaser is being unreasonable if they read or question the terms, saying that they are "just something the lawyers want us to do" or that they are wasting their time reading them. If the purchaser is at the front of a queue (for example at an airport car rental desk) there is additional pressure to sign quickly.  Finally, if there has been negotiation over price or particular details, then concessions given by the salesperson may be seen as a [[gift]] which socially obliges the purchaser to respond by being co-operative and concluding the transaction.
;Standard form contracts may exploit unequal power relations: If the good which is being sold using a contract of adhesion is one which is essential or very important for the purchaser to buy (such as a rental property or a needed medical item) then the purchaser might feel they have no choice but to accept the terms. This problem may be mitigated if there are many suppliers of the good who can potentially offer different terms (see below), although even this is not always possible (for instance, a college freshman may be required to sign a standard-form dormitory rental agreement and accept its terms, because the college will not allow a freshman to live off-campus).

Some contend that in a competitive market, consumers have the ability to shop around for the supplier who offers them the most favorable terms and are consequently able to avoid injustice.  However, in the case of credit cards (and other oligopolies), for example, the consumer while having the ability to shop around may still have access to only form contracts with like terms and no opportunity for negotiation. Also, as noted, many people do not read or understand the terms so there might be very little incentive for a firm to offer favorable conditions as they would gain only a small amount of business from doing so. Even if this is the case, it is argued by some that only a small percentage of buyers need to actively read standard form contracts for it to be worthwhile for firms to offer better terms if that group is able to influence a larger number of people by affecting the firm’s reputation.

Another factor which might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm’s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumer's ability to shop around.

==Common law status==
As a general rule, the common law treats standard form contracts like any other contract. Signature or some other objective manifestation of intent to be legally bound will bind the signor to the contract whether or not they read or understood the terms. The reality of standard form contracting, however, means that many common law jurisdictions have developed special rules with respect to them. In general, in the event of an ambiguity, the courts will interpret standard form contracts ''[[contra proferentem]]'' against the party that drafted the contract, as that party (and only that party) had the ability to draft the contract to remove ambiguity.

===United States===

====Generally====
Standard form contracts are generally enforceable in the United States. The [[Uniform Commercial Code]] which is followed in most [[U.S. state|American states]] has specific provisions relating to standard form contracts for the sale or lease of goods. Furthermore, standard form contracts will be subject to special scrutiny if they are found to be contracts of adhesion.

====Contracts of adhesion====
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Parkingticketcontract.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Contract of adhesion on timekeeping ticket dispensed by vending machine at parking lot entrance {{pufc|Parkingticketcontract.jpg}}]] --&gt;
The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, E., ''The Delivery of a Life-Insurance Policy'', 33 Harvard Law Review, 198 (1919); see also [[Friedrich Kessler]], ''Contracts of Adhesion — Some Thoughts About Freedom of Contract'',  43 Colum. L. Rev. 629 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the [[Supreme Court of California]] endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962.  ''See'' ''Steven v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co.'', 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining history of concept).&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/58C2d862.htm Steven v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. (1962) 58 C2d 862&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a "take it or leave it" basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:

*If the term was outside of the reasonable expectations of the person who did not write the contract, and if the parties were contracting on an unequal basis, then it will not be enforceable. The reasonable expectation is assessed objectively, looking at the prominence of the term, the purpose of the term and the circumstances surrounding acceptance of the contract.
*Section 211 of the [[American Law Institute]]'s [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]], which has persuasive though non-binding force in courts, provides:
::''Where the other party has reason to believe that the party manifesting such assent would not do so if he knew that the writing contained a particular term, the term is not part of the agreement.''
:This is a subjective test focusing on the mind of the seller and has been adopted by only a few state courts.
*The doctrine of [[unconscionability]] is a fact-specific doctrine arising from [[Equity (law)|equitable]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} principles. Unconscionability in standard form contracts usually arises where there is an "absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms which are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept them." (''Fanning v. Fritz's Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;472 S.E.2d 242, 254 (S.C. 1996) (**Note: this definition is only good law in South Carolina)).&lt;/ref&gt;)

====Shrink wrap contracts====
Courts in the United States have faced the issue of [[shrink wrap contract]]s in two ways. One line of cases follows ''[[ProCD v. Zeidenberg]]'' which held such contracts enforceable (e.g. ''[http://www.kentlaw.edu/faculty/rstaudt/classes/oldclasses/internetlaw/casebook/brower.html Brower v Gateway]''), and the other follows ''[http://www.lawnix.com/cases/klocek-gateway.html Klocek v. Gateway, Inc]'', which found them unenforceable. These decisions are split on the question of assent, with the former holding that only objective manifestation of assent is required while the latter require at least the possibility of subjective assent.

===Canada===
In Canada, [[exclusion clause]]s in a standard form contract cannot be relied on where a seller knows or has reason to know a purchaser is mistaken as to its terms (''[[Tilden Rent-A-Car Co. v. Clendenning]]'').

===Australia===
Standard form contracts have generally received little special treatment under Australian common law. A 2003 [[New South Wales]] Court of Appeal case (''Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited'') gave some support for the position that notice of exceptional terms is required for them to be incorporated. However the defendant successfully appealed to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] so currently there is no special treatment of standard form contracts in Australia.

Since 1 January 2011, the [[Australian Consumer Law]] has been enacted in Australia at the national level, and due to a [[Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG) agreement this legislation is now part of each jurisdiction's (state's or territory's) Fair Trading laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00003 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408200656/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00003 |archivedate=2011-04-08 |df= }}

Also refer to each State and Territory Fair Trading Department's websites.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In India leonine contracts are generally deemed unconscionable contracts (though not all leonine contracts are unconscionable contracts) and are voidable. The [https://indiankanoon.org/doc/140848451/ 199th Law Commission report (2006) on "UNFAIR (PROCEDURAL &amp; SUBSTANTIVE) TERMS IN CONTRACT"] deals with it. The unfairness can be procedural or substantive.

==Legislation==
In recognition of the consumer protection issues which may arise, many governments have passed specific laws relating to standard form contracts. These are generally enacted on a state level as part of general consumer protection legislation and typically allow consumers to avoid clauses which are found to be unreasonable, though the specific provisions vary greatly. Some laws require notice to be given for these clauses to be effective, others prohibit unfair clauses altogether (e.g. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/fta1999117/s32x.html Victorian Fair Trading Act 1999]).

===United Kingdom===
Section 3 of the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] limits the ability of the drafter of consumer or standard form contracts to draft clauses which would allow him to exclude liability in what is termed an exclusion clause - the act does not per se render ineffective provisions in other areas which to the layman appear "unfair". Where a contract is negotiated the provisions of the act likely would not apply - the law protects from a lot of things but openly making a bad bargain is not one of them.

The '''Standard Form Contract Act 1982''' defines a set of depriving conditions that may be canceled by a court of law, including unreasonable exclusion or limitation of liability, unreasonable privileges to unilaterally cancel, suspend or postpone the execution of the contract and to change any fundamental charges or pricing,  transfer of liability for the execution of the contract to a third party, unreasonable obligation to use the services of a third party or to limit, in any way, the choice of contracting third parties, denial of legal remedy, unreasonable limitations on contractual remedies or setting unreasonable conditions for the consummation of the remedy, denying or limiting the right for legal procedures, exclusive rights to decide on the location of the trial or arbitration, obligatory arbitration with unilaterally control over the arbitrators or the location of the arbitration and setting the holder of the burden of proof contrary to common law. The act also establishes a '''Standard Form Contract Court''', chaired by a district judge and consists of a maximum of 12 members, appointed by the justice minister, including an acting chairman (also a district judge), civil servants (no more than a third) and, at least, 2 consumer organization representatives. The court holds hearings regarding appeals against standard form contract clauses or approval of a specific standard form contract at the requests of a provider.

===Lithuania===
Standard conditions in Lithuania shall be such provisions which are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one contracting party without their content being negotiated with another party, and which are used in the formation of contracts without negotiation with the other party. Standard conditions prepared by one of the parties shall be binding to the other if the latter was provided with an adequate opportunity of getting acquainted with the said conditions (Article 6.185. Standard conditions of contracts, [[Lithuanian Civil Code]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterlang.com/download/datasheet/57891/datasheet_260343.pdf Standard Contract Terms in Cross-Border Business Transactions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034712/http://www.peterlang.com/download/datasheet/57891/datasheet_260343.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }} (A Comparative Study from the Perspective of European Union Law), PDF (by Attorney Dr. Gintautas Šulija, LL.M., LL.M.)&lt;/ref&gt; A consumer shall have the right to claim within the judicial procedure for invalidity of conditions in a consumer contract that are contrary to the criterion of good faith (Article 6.188).

==Civil law countries==

===Russia===
In July 2013, Russian Dmitry Agarkov won a court case against [[Tinkoff Bank]] after he altered the standard form contract he had received in the mail. The bank, failing to notice the changes, accepted the application and gave him an account based on the amended contract. The judge ruled that the bank was legally bound to the contract it had signed. Agarkov is further suing the bank for failing to comply with the terms he had added to the contract, which it had unwittingly agreed to by signing the contract. Agarkov's lawyer, Dmitry Mihalevich said – "They signed the documents without looking. They said what usually their borrowers say in court: 'We have not read it'." &lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-man-got-bank-sign-144810926.html Russian Man Who Got Bank to Sign Homemade Credit Card Contract Now Suing Them for Not Following Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918223129/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-man-got-bank-sign-144810926.html |date=2016-09-18 }}, ''[[Yahoo News]]'', 8 Aug 2013.

{{US fed civ pro}}
'''Territorial jurisdiction''' in [[United States law]] refers to a court's power over events and persons within the bounds of a particular geographic territory. If a court does not have territorial jurisdiction over the events or persons within it, then the court cannot bind the defendant to an obligation or adjudicate any rights involving them. Territorial jurisdiction is to be distinguished from [[subject-matter jurisdiction]], which is the power of a court to render a judgment concerning a certain subject matter, or [[personal jurisdiction]], which is the power of a court to render a judgment concerning particular persons, wherever they may be. Personal jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction, subject-matter jurisdiction, and proper [[notice]] to the defendant are prerequisites for a valid judgment.

==The types of territorial jurisdiction==

===Types of jurisdictional territory within the international system===
*Incorporated national territory, within which all residents are considered [[United States|American]] citizens.
*Unincorporated national territory. This can include territories in which the residents do not have full rights.
*Trust territories or dependencies. These are territories with some of the attributes of a nation-state but not full independence, administered by a nation, perhaps with international sanction.
*Occupied territories. These are usually the result of war and conquest, and ruled by [[martial law]] imposed by the conqueror.
*International commons. Territory not under the jurisdiction of any nation, but open to use by all, subject to treaty restrictions. This includes the high seas beyond coastal territorial limits, [[Antarctica]], and Outer Space.
*National flag vessels at sea. The vessel is considered to be part of the territory of the nation whose flag it flies, and subject to the laws of that nation. A vessel without a national flag may be considered a stateless vessel. A stateless vessel is, on the high seas, not subject to any State's exclusive jurisdiction.
*Diplomatic grounds. The grounds of foreign embassies and some consulates, like vessels at sea, are considered part of the territory of the nation they represent. Contrary to popular belief, however, diplomatic missions do not enjoy full extraterritorial status and are not sovereign territory of the represented state. Rather, the premises of diplomatic missions remain under the jurisdiction of the host state while being afforded special privileges (such as immunity from most local laws) by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].
*Foreign military bases. Like diplomatic facilities, they may or may not constitute territory of the nation whose forces are stationed there, depending on a [[status of forces agreement]].
*Extraterritorial jurisdiction. This is asserted by most nations over their military and diplomatic personnel while abroad, and by some nations over subjects like piracy and offenses against the law of nations, such as "crimes against humanity" or [[genocide]], or taxation of income of citizens obtained from foreign sources.

===Types of jurisdictional territory within a nation===
This will vary from one nation to another, but we can illustrate the types by examining the [[United States]], and how there can be different territorial jurisdiction for different subjects:
*Territories over which the central government has [[exclusive jurisdiction]] for a broad range of subjects. Created by [[U.S. Constitution]], Art. I Sec. 8 Cl. 17.
*Territories over which the state government has exclusive jurisdiction for a broad range of subjects. State territory excluding territory ceded under Art. I Sec. 8 Cl. 17.
*Unincorporated territories over which the central government has exclusive jurisdiction under Art. IV Sec. 3 Cl. 2.
*State territory over which the central government has jurisdiction, either exclusive or concurrent, on a few specific subjects.
*County territory within which the county government has exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction with the state.
*Township territory within which the town government has exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction with the county or state.
*Federal judicial districts within which the court for that district has exclusive jurisdiction.
*State or local judicial districts within which the court for that district has exclusive jurisdiction.
*Neighborhood associations that may exercise townlike powers over their neighborhoods.
*Administrative district territories, with powers to make rules and adjudicate cases concerning things like utilities, transportation facitlies, etc.

==Constitutional limits==
The [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court of the United States]] has held that [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] requirements of [[due process]] limit the exercise of subject or personal jurisdiction beyond territorial limits.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The same outer territorial boundaries for subject jurisdiction apply in both state courts and federal courts. Moreover, because of Rule 4 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] (FRCP 4), a federal court ordinarily applies the personal jurisdiction statutes (e.g., [[long-arm statute]]s) of the state in which it sits, even when the state has not extended personal jurisdiction to its territorial limits. (Some states, such as [[California]], have long-arm statutes that give their courts personal jurisdiction to the extent constitutionally permitted.) In some exceptional circumstances, FRCP 4 grants a federal court personal jurisdiction when the law of the state in which it sits would not.

Territorial jurisdiction problems are acute in cases involving business transactions conducted across state lines, where the defendant may not have set foot in the other state, but still conducted affairs with the other state's residents through correspondence, the shipment of goods, or indirect agents. Even more difficult, and more unsettled, territorial jurisdiction issues arise in ''stream of commerce'' cases. In the quintessential stream of commerce case, a defendant in one state sells a widget to a manufacturer in the same state, which incorporates the widget into a retail product and sells it to a consumer in another state, who then sues claiming injury from the widget. The leading Supreme Court stream of commerce case &lt;ref&gt;''Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court'', [[Case citation|480 U.S. 102]] (1987). Decided February 24, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a split, failing to clarify the issue.

Internet cases raise several troublesome territorial jurisdiction problems. For example, a website may be viewed anywhere in the world, though it is hosted in [[Anguilla]] and operated by a California citizen. Courts must decide in which locations, under what circumstances, the exercise of territorial jurisdiction over the citizen for claims arising from the website comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. For more, see [[Personal jurisdiction in internet cases]].

==Relationship to venue==
[[Venue (law)|Venue]] and territorial jurisdiction are closely related for practical purposes. A change of venue may be sought either within the territorial jurisdiction of a court, or with the consent of the receiving jurisdiction and the parties, within the jurisdiction of another court, provided it has jurisdiction over the same laws.

The '''Treaty of Nystad''' ({{lang-ru|Ништадтский мир}}; {{lang-fi|Uudenkaupungin rauha}}; {{lang-sv|Freden i Nystad}}; {{lang-et|Uusikaupunki rahu}}) was the last peace treaty of the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700&amp;ndash;1721. It was concluded between the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and the [[Swedish Empire]] on {{OldStyleDate|10 September|1721|30 August}} in the then Swedish town of [[Uusikaupunki|Nystad]] ({{lang-fi|Uusikaupunki}}, in the south-west of present-day Finland). Sweden had settled with the other parties in [[Treaties of Stockholm (Great Northern War)|Stockholm]] (1719 and 1720) and in [[Treaty of Frederiksborg|Frederiksborg]] (1720).

During the war [[Peter I of Russia]] had occupied all Swedish possessions on the eastern [[Baltic Sea|Baltic coast]]: [[Swedish Ingria]] (where he began to build the soon-to-be new Russian capital of [[St. Petersburg]] in 1703), [[Swedish Estonia]] and [[Swedish Livonia]] (which [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia|had capitulated in 1710]]), and [[Finland]].

In Nystad, King [[Frederick I of Sweden]] formally recognized the transfer of Estonia, Livonia, Ingria, and Southeast Finland ([[Kexholmslän]] and part of [[Karelia]]) to Russia in exchange for two million silver [[Swedish riksdaler|thaler]], while Russia returned the bulk of Finland to Swedish rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ru| РГАДА.

The Treaty enshrined the rights of the German [[Baltic nobility]] within Estonia and Livonia to maintain their financial system, their existing customs border, their self-government, their [[Lutheran]] religion, and the German language; this special position in the Russian Empire was reconfirmed by all Russian Tsars from [[Peter the Great]] (reigned 1682-1725) to [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Imperial Russian foreign policy |last= Ragsdale |first= Hugh |authorlink= |author2=V.

Nystad manifested the decisive shift in the [[European balance of power]] which the war had brought about: the [[Swedish Empire|Swedish imperial era]] had ended; Sweden entered the [[Age of Liberty]], while [[Russian Empire|Russia had emerged as a new empire]].

==Legacy==
In pre-1917 Saint Petersburg, in the Vyborgsky district (relatively nearest to Russo-Finnish border) one of the thoroughfares (now ''Lesnoy prospekt'') was named after the Nystad treaty (Nystadt Street, Rus. Ништадтская улица).&lt;ref&gt;Лев Успенский. Записки старого петербуржца. (Lev Uspenskii. Zapiski starogo peterburjca.)

The '''United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims''' (in [[case citation]]s, '''Vet. App.''') is a federal [[court of record]] that was established under [[Article I of the United States Constitution]], and is thus referred to as an [[Federal tribunals in the United States#Article I tribunals|Article I tribunal]] (court).  The court has exclusive national jurisdiction to provide independent, federal, judicial oversight and review of final decisions of the [[Board of Veterans' Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/ |title=USCAVC – United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims |publisher=Uscourts.cavc.gov |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is commonly referred to as the Veterans Court, USCAVC, or simply CAVC.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims was formerly named the United States Court of Veterans Appeals, but was changed by the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act on March 1, 1999 (Pub.L. No. 105-368).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{uspl|105|368}}, {{USStat|112|3315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions for the Veterans Court and other information about the Court can be found at [http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/orders_and_opinions/Opinions.cfm/ www.uscourts.cavc.gov].  The Veterans Court is located in [[Washington, D.C.]] but may sit anywhere in the United States.  While the Board of Veterans' Appeals is a part of the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]], the Veterans Court is not a part of the VA, it is an independent federal court.  The Veterans Court hears oral arguments and reviews final Board decisions, the record before the agency, and the briefs of the parties for each appeal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/about/ |title=USCAVC – About the Court |publisher=Uscourts.cavc.gov |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018234153/http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/about/ |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each judge on the Court serves a 15-year term.

==Jurisdiction==
The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has "exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals ... [with the] power to affirm, modify, or reverse a decision of the Board [of Veterans' Appeals] or to remand the matter, as appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vlex.com/vid/sec-jurisdiction-finality-decisions-19233752 |title=38 USC 7252 – Sec. 7252.

==History==
The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims was created on November 18, 1988, by the [[Judicial review|Veterans' Judicial Review Act of 1988]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{uspl|100|687}}, {{USStat|102|4105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="openlibrary1"&gt;{{cite web|author=United States. Congress. House ... |url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL17835255M/Veterans'_Judicial_Review_Act |title=Veterans' Judicial Review Act |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the establishment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, from the [[U.S. Revolutionary War]] to 1988, there was no judicial recourse for veterans who were denied benefits.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/about/History.cfm |title=USCAVC – History |publisher=Uscourts.cavc.gov |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]], formerly titled the Veterans Administration, was the only federal administrative agency that operated without independent judicial oversight.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  The Board of Veterans' Appeals, which is a part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, provided the final decision in a veteran's claim for benefits.

Veterans, advocacy groups, and [[List of veterans' organizations|veterans service organizations]] fought and urged Congress to provide judicial review of VA decisions since the 1950s.  The lack of judicial review persisted, however, until the increase in veterans claims following the [[Vietnam War]].  The struggles of these veterans to obtain VA benefits highlighted the lack of independent oversight in the adjudication process.  The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs initially resisted, noting that the Department of Veterans Affairs stood in "splendid isolation as the single federal administrative agency whose major functions were explicitly insulated from judicial review."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

After decades of debate, on November 18, 1988, Congress created the United States Court of Veterans Appeals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="openlibrary1"/&gt;  On March 1, 1999, the Court's name was changed from the United States Court of Veterans Appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims through the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act (Pub.L. No. 105-368).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Judges==
[[File:United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims judges 2013.jpg|thumb|United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in 2013]]
Judges are appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims by the [[President of the United States]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]],  in the same manner as [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article III Judges]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  They are appointed to serve fifteen-year appointments. Retired judges are routinely recalled to active service to assist the Court in issuing its decisions in a timely manner.

"'''Very Tough Love'''" is a [[radio documentary]] and an episode of the show ''[[This American Life]]'' (''TAL''), which [[List of 2011 This American Life episodes|originally aired on March 25, 2011]]. The segment described a [[drug court]] and program in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] that is conducted in a manner different from all other drug courts throughout the United States, and often contrary to drug court philosophy, according to standards set by the [[National Association of Drug Court Professionals]]. People with no criminal record or history of drug abuse or addiction, and charged with possession of small drug quantities would wind up under drug court control for five years or more. In most other jurisdictions, the same offenses would result in probation or a drug education class.&lt;ref name=VTL1 /&gt;

==New project==
In the spring of 2010, ''TAL'' staff took on a different challenge: follow the methods used by Charles Salter in the 1970s when he wrote hundreds of "Georgia Rambler" columns for the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution|Atlanta Journal]]''. Nine diverse counties across Georgia were selected—none with a major city—and teams of reporters and producers fanned out to find an interesting story in each location. Stories from all but one county were broadcast in episode 413: "Georgia Rambler" on July 30, 2010. Two other stories took longer to prepare. "Original Recipe" episode 427 aired February 11, 2011, which reprised a Salter column about a handwritten [[Coca-Cola]] recipe. The other, "Very Tough Love", took eight months to research and compile.&lt;ref name=CURRENT&gt;Everhart, Karen: [http://www.current.org/news/news1112georgiarambler.html "Georgia ramble turns exposé"] Current website, June 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode followed the show's standard format, telling the stories of several people, recording them speaking from their perspective. What was different was that ''TAL'' Producer [[Ira Glass]]  delegated his regular ''TAL'' responsibilities for several weeks to personally research the story. He made several trips to Georgia to interview people for supporting testimony, acquired documents, discovered background information and made repeated requests to get Judge Williams to answer many questions raised.&lt;ref name=CURRENT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rassmussen, Sean Paul: [http://www.seanrasmussen.ca/2011/03/storytelling-or-investigative.html "Investigative Journalism Into Storytelling: Ira Glass' Very Tough Love"] SPR Media Reviews &amp; Commentary, March 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content of the show==
The episode's name is derived from Judge [[Amanda Williams]]' comments that she believes in the use of [[tough love]] by families dealing with drug problems. The title is used because Williams' actions far exceed the normal standard of tough love, coming closer to [[Authoritarian Parenting|Authoritarian parenting]], which is often linked to negative outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8348938.stm "Tough love 'is good for children'"], ''BBC News'', 8 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The show begins with Glass providing background on the home town of the person he is about to interview at [[Arrendale State Prison|Lee Arrendale State Prison]] in northeast Georgia.&lt;br&gt; 
The story of '''Lindsey Dills''' is the primary focus of the episode. She began playing soccer in the youth league, and by high school, she was outstanding. However, she wasn't coping with her parents separating, and began [[Self-harm|self-mutilating]] and smoking pot. Her parents got her into treatment programs several times, but it didn't help. She got a job at a restaurant/bar and started hanging out with older employees after work, doing cocaine. She decided to quit soccer before her senior year, and nobody could talk her out of it.&lt;ref name=VTL1 /&gt; Dills commented, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The coaches were calling the house, telling my dad to ‘talk to her.’ And part of it was the drugs, part of it was I'd done it so long. And I wanted to be a teenager. I wanted to do stuff on weekends and I wanted not to have to practice at 5 in the morning and I didn't want to have to run 3 miles every other day.&lt;ref name=VTL1&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 1"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Her parents divorced, her mother moved away, and she lived with her father. One weekend when her dad was out of town, she forged two checks that totalled $100 from her father's account and used the money to buy drugs. 

Upon his return, her CPA father quickly found the discrepancy. Her actions scared him and he desperately wanted to help his daughter before she was beyond help.&lt;ref name=VTL1 /&gt; He began taking her for drug tests, and told her if she failed, he would go to the police with the forged checks. She passed several tests using diluted urine or getting a clean sample from someone else, but she finally tested positive. By now, she had stopped going to school, and her parents decided this might be their last opportunity to intervene. Forgery charges were filed, and Lindsey was arrested.     
Her parents told her that the charges would be dropped if she agreed to check into an out-of-town drug treatment program, away from her friends. But Lindsey didn't want to leave Brunswick and go somewhere chosen by her parents. The prosecutor suggested another option, drug court.&lt;ref name=VTL2 /&gt;

The first drug court was started during 1989 in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] to deal with a [[crack epidemic|crack cocaine epidemic]]. These non-violent offenders committed crimes to support their drug addiction. The new system required court-supervised [[Drug addiction|drug treatment]] which was cheaper than incarceration and helped people end their addiction and become productive members of society. In 2005, there were 1,262 Drug courts in the United States, but the one in Brunswick was run by Judge Amanda Williams and many locals were afraid of her.&lt;ref name=VTL2&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 2"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;   

Lindsey Dills explained what happened: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
So Jason Clarke is my public defender at the time and he's warning me. He's saying, "Lindsey don't take drug court. I'm telling you, you won't make it." He's told me this like three or four times. I'm adamant. I'm saying, "I'm taking drug court." Because all I know is I get to get out of jail. It's all I know. I don't know anything else about it. So I go to plead into drug court. My dad's in the court room. Judge Barton was on the bench that day instead of Judge Williams. She was gone. My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. Are you sure you want to do this?" He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.&lt;ref name=VTL3 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She opted to go to drug court and was released from jail. The average duration in drug court in the United States is 15 months; three years is rare.&lt;ref name=VTL3 /&gt; On Friday of the week after her court appearance, she violated the 9 o'clock curfew and got caught, then failed a drug test. According to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP), it is not unusual for most people who enter a drug court program to relapse in the beginning, so it is part of the program.   

When Dills went before Judge Williams, the judge screamed at Dills, who began to cry. The judge sentenced her to seven days in jail, which was unusually harsh for a first relapse, even for Judge Williams, whose normal punishment for first relapse is three days; seven days for a second relapse; and 28 days for a third occurrence.&lt;ref name=VTL6&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 6"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;
 
West Huddleston is executive director of the NADCP, the primary support organization for the nation's 2,400+ drug courts and 25,000 counselors, lawyers, and judges. He commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any drug court that relies primarily on jail, or punishment generally, is operating way outside our philosophy and just does not understand addiction. They’ve (addicts) lost their jobs, their income, they’ve lost their loved ones. I mean, all of those natural consequences which are much more severe than a day or two or three in jail have not stopped them from using drugs and alcohol. Why would we think putting them in jail would do so?".&lt;ref name="VTL6"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Judge Williams had a special sanction for people who relapsed four or more times. She would send them away for "indefinite sentences" and make comments like, "They're going to sit their ass over there till they get a better attitude" or "Take them away; you'll come back when I'm ready for you".&lt;ref name=VTL7&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 7"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When Dills violated drug court rules, she served jail terms of 51 days, 90 days and 104 days.  
Dills had been in the drug program for 42 months when she went to court on October 8, 2008. The judge took Dills into chambers with the drug court staff and debated terminating Dills from the program, which would require her to serve 20–24 months in prison for the original forgery charges. Finally, Judge Williams told Dills to do 28 days in jail. After Dills was returned to jail, the judge phoned and ordered Dills to have "no further contact", which meant no visitors, phone calls or mail. She was also placed in an isolation cell. When Dills asked if the isolation was for the full 28 days, the guard told her that the order had been changed to an "indefinite sentence".&lt;ref name="VTL7"/&gt;

Twenty-eight days passed, and Dills was still in [[solitary confinement]]. She ran out of the two antidepressants prescribed by the drug court doctor, and the guards weren't permitted to talk to her, so her depression returned, causing her to cry constantly. Thanksgiving passed with no contact, but Dills convinced herself that Judge Williams wouldn't leave her in jail through Christmas. She briefly saw a drug counselor on December 8 who informed her that there would be no drug court until January because Judge Williams was on vacation. Dills lost hope, and when an opportunity presented itself, she tried to commit suicide by slitting her wrists. Her attempt was discovered before she bled out, and her life was saved.&lt;ref name="floridatimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf |title=This American Life Episode 430 |work=This American Life |date=March 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VTL9&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 9"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug policy===
The drug policy in [[Glynn County, Georgia]] was established by Amanda F. Williams, chief judge of the [[Georgia Superior Courts|Glynn County Superior Court]]. She had been on the bench since 1991, and started the drug court in 1998.&lt;ref name=VTL13 /&gt; By almost any standard, the program is [[wikt:draconian|draconian]].
Judges in general have enormous power, and drug court judges wield almost unlimited power because participants are required to waive many of their rights when they choose that option. The  sanctions of the judge are viewed as part of "treatment", not the imposition of a sentence. Judge Williams insisted that all defendants have a choice, but the local criminal justice system strongly "encourages" defendants to choose drug court.&lt;ref name=VTL4&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 4"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brunswick, anyone arrested and charged with a non-violent drug crime must appear at the next once-a-week drug court. If the charge is a felony, there is no bail; bail for misdemeanors is $15,000. A former Glynn County Public Defender told Glass that most defendants could not post the hefty bond, so they stay in jail. Judge Williams personally handles all drug cases.&lt;ref name=VTL13 /&gt; 

In drug court, there are two choices: plead guilty or go to trial. Judge Williams warns those who choose a trial that if found guilty, they will not receive probation; they will go to prison for a minimum of 20 to 24 months. The only way to get out of jail before trial is to post a minimum $15,000 bond.&lt;ref name=VTL13&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 13"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;

Defendants who plead guilty have a choice: immediately begin serving a minimum 10 to 12 months in a probation detention center where inmates are put to work and are ineligible for parole, -or- enter the drug court program and be immediately released on [[Recognizance|personal recognizance]]. Given those choices, the vast majority choose drug court.&lt;ref name=VTL13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=VTL11 /&gt; 

According to the ''Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.audits.ga.gov/PAO/PAOdivision.html&lt;/ref&gt; 378 individuals participated in the Glynn/Camden drug court in 2009, the largest in the state. The population of Glynn and Camden Counties is approximately 100,000. By contrast, [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], which includes [[Atlanta]], had just 330 participants from a population exceeding one million.&lt;ref name=VTL11&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 11"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in drug court are required to submit to random and weekly drug tests; observe 9:00pm curfews; participate in five drug court group therapy and individual counseling sessions each week; attend at least four [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] or [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings each week; refrain from imbibing alcoholic beverages; obey all laws; and appear in court periodically.&lt;ref name=VTL3&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 3"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrong participants===
The experiences of '''Brandi Byrd''' illustrate another problematic case. Byrd was out with a friend who was charged with [[DUI]]. Byrd gave the police permission to search her purse, and two [[Dextropropoxyphene|darvocet]] pills were found. She explained that her mother had given them to her after minor surgery and she had forgotten about them, but she was charged with two felonies, one for each pill. After sitting in jail for six days, Byrd went to court. The public defender and the drug court counselors told her if she didn't agree to drug court, she would go to prison.  
Judge Williams told her, "There is no such thing as putting you on probation. If you don't beat the rap, there is no street probation for charges in this county, and hasn't been for seven years, since I've had drug court."&lt;ref name=VTL13 /&gt;

Despite the fact that Byrd had no history of drug addiction or abuse and no criminal record, she felt like she had no choice but to agree to drug court supervision or go to prison. Then came the [[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]]; she was told she had to admit to drug use and addiction or she couldn't get into the program. 
West Huddleston, NADCP executive director, described the individuals to whom drug court programs are targeted: "long histories of addiction...multiple treatment failures...multiple times on probation...served previous jail or prison sentences...driven by their addiction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, pages 11–14"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;       

When people without addiction and past criminal behavior are placed in an intensive treatment program, they tend to rebel and become defiant because the therapy is of no benefit to them and they feel they don't deserve the restrictions placed on their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, pages 14–15"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success stories===
The program does have its supporters and success stories. If a participant follows all the rules, they can complete the program and have their convictions purged in 30 months. The situation of '''Charlie McCullough''' should have been a complete success story, but it took a detour. McCullough was caught in a police sting buying drugs, and entered drug court voluntarily, determined to kick drugs. Everything went fine for 22 months; he never missed a meeting or appointment and passed all his drug tests. Then at a random urine screening, the lab technician told him he tested positive for [[methamphetamine]]. McCullough insisted that he was clean and asked to take another test, which he passed. A third test was administered, which he also passed, so McCullough was relieved. At his next court appearance, Judge Williams asked why he failed a drug test. He was surprised, and stated that he passed the second test. The judge told him she was going to use the first test; the second one didn't count. No matter how much he professed his innocence, the judge didn't believe him. The judge refused to bring in the lab technician to testify, but asked McCullough if he would take a polygraph, which he agreed, then she changed her mind and sentenced him to three days in jail for a "bad" test and 14 days for questioning the results of the drug screening. From that point on, his drug court experience went downhill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, pages 16–17"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;       
  
Lawyer Jim Jenkins, who represented clients in the drug court, concurred:  
"I don't disagree with the people who tell me she means well, but I think the record in too many cases speaks for itself, that a lot of people have had their constitutional and procedural rights run roughshod over."&lt;ref name="floridatimes"/&gt;

==Reception==
The show was well received by listeners, spawning a firestorm of controversy towards Judge Williams, some of which was from other legal professionals, calls for Williams' resignation or impeachment, and death threats against her.&lt;ref name=floridatimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=Terry|title=Glynn judge's bench now a hot seat|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/georgia/2011-05-01/story/glynn-judges-bench-now-hot-seat|publisher=The Florida Times Union|accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Business Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=Robin|title=Broadcast prompts threats and calls for judge’s ouster|url=http://www.atlawblog.com/2011/03/broadcast-prompts-threats-and-calls-for-judge’s-ouster/|publisher=ALM Media Properties, LLC|accessdate=20 November 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117231054/http://www.atlawblog.com/2011/03/broadcast-prompts-threats-and-calls-for-judge%E2%80%99s-ouster/|archive-date=17 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=georgian&gt;{{cite news|last=Beavers|first=Mark|title=Legal battle brewing over broadcast|url=http://www.tribune-georgian.com/articles/2011/04/20/news/top_stories/1topstory4.20.txt|accessdate=14 June 2011|newspaper=Tribune &amp; Georgian Online|date=20 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233903/http://www.tribune-georgian.com/articles/2011/04/20/news/top_stories/1topstory4.20.txt|archive-date=25 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject was discussed on dozens of internet sites, and the website, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110729085809/http://impeachjudgewilliams.com/ Impeach Judge Williams] was set up. A page on [[Facebook]] with the title, ''Judge Amanda Williams Must Be Stopped'' was created. One person called her a "monster" and stated, "This woman is the reason the rest of the country thinks Georgia is such a backwater."&lt;ref name=HOT&gt;Rankin, Bill: [http://jacksonville.com/news/georgia/2011-04-30/story/glynn-judges-bench-now-hot-seat "Glynn judge's bench now a hot seat"] Florida Times-Union, April 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of Williams following the show included claims that at times she imposed indefinite stays in jail and other excessively punitive sentences contrary to principles supported by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals.&lt;ref name="Fly In The Drug Court Ointment"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassinger|first=Mike|title=Fly In The Drug Court Ointment|url=http://www.peachpundit.com/2011/03/31/fly-in-the-drug-court-ointment/|publisher=Peach Pundit|accessdate=December 21, 2011|date=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Drug Courts?|url=http://www.nadcp.org/learn/what-are-drug-courts|publisher=National Association of Drug Court Professionals|accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association supports the principle that "drug courts are designed to reduce drug use, reduce crime, repair families, hold addicts accountable and restore them to meaningful roles in society."&lt;ref name="Fly In The Drug Court Ointment"/&gt;

The NADCP Board of Directors issued a statement in response to the disturbing events reported in the program. They reiterated the contention made by Ira Glass that the Glynn County Drug Court is "run differently than any other Drug Court in the Country". They further stated that 6% of U.S. Drug Courts "have watered down or dropped core ingredients of the Drug Court model, or apply inappropriate practices in contraindication to accepted teachings in the field. And they have paid dearly for it in terms of lower cost savings, lower graduation rates, higher recidivism rates, and a reputation for unfairness and ineffectiveness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nadcp.org/sites/default/files/nadcp/NADCP%20Statement%20-%20This%20American%20Life.pdf "Public Radio’s This American Life 'Very Tough Love'"] NADCP Board of Directors Statement&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Williams defended her approach explaining, "there's some addiction in my family. My husband has been in recovery for over 15 years. And about the time I started looking to start a drug court about 1996, he had gotten into recovery. So we’ve lived it as a family. Because all the family members are touched by it."&lt;ref name=VTL5&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL430_transcript.pdf "Show transcript, page 5"] This American Life, Very Tough Love&lt;/ref&gt;

After the story aired, Williams hired David G. Oedel, a law professor at [[Mercer University]], who published an open letter to ''This American Life'' executive producer Ira Glass, claiming that the story was "riddled with falsehoods," and "[[libel]] masquerading as journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.atlawblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Letter_to_Glass_April_8_20111.pdf| title = Open Letter to Ira Glass| first = David G.| last = Oedel| date = April 8, 2011| accessdate = November 7, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On April 12, 2011, Glass made a note on the ''TAL'' blog that a clarification and a correction had been made to the story on the web. The correction concerned the reason for Kim Spead's 12 months of incarceration after completing the program. After reviewing court documents, Glass concluded that it was for violating the terms and conditions of the Drug Court sentence and contract, and not for failing to pay the $1,500 program costs assessed to drug court participants.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;Glass, Ira: [http://www.thisamericanlife.org/blog/2011/04/a-clarification-and-a-correction "A clarification and a correction"] This American Life website, April 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The clarification was made because there is sometimes a legal recourse when the judge imposes a sanction, but only in specialized circumstances.&lt;ref name=CC /&gt;

However, Glass stood by the story's details, especially his characterization of defendants receiving inappropriately harsh treatment in Williams' courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thisamericanlife.org/blog/2011/04/ira-responds-to-judge-williams-press-release| title = Ira responds to Judge Williams' press release| work = This American Life blog|date=April 15, 2011| accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to Oedel's threat to sue ''TAL'' for defamation, the show's lawyers defended Glass and the story, asserting that Williams' conduct "is certainly a matter of keen public interest".&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, R. Robin: [http://www.dailybusinessreview.com/PubArticleFriendlyDBR.jsp?id=1202532160491 "Judge accused of nepotism and abusing power from bench"] Daily Business Review, November 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics probe==
On November 9, 2011, the Georgia ''Judicial Qualifications Commission'' (JQC) filed a 14-count ethics complaint against Williams, alleging she had incarcerated defendants indefinitely, made false statements, and engaged in nepotism and "tyrannical partiality".&lt;ref name=ajc111611&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/judge-relinquishes-cases-amid-1228195.html |title=Judge relinquishes cases amid ethics probe |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |first=Bill |last=Rankin |date=November 16, 2011 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atlantaunfiltered.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Amanda-Williams-formal-charges.pdf |title=Notice of Formal Proceedings |work=Judicial Qualifications Commission |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JQC appointed [[Leah Ward Sears]], a former Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice who left the court in 2009, to prosecute the ethics charges.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Robin: [http://www.dailyreportonline.com/Editorial/News/singleEdit.asp?l=101319912111 "'Tyrannical' judge to be prosecuted"] 
Daily Report, December 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
A hearing was scheduled to be held in 2012 to determine whether and how Williams should be disciplined.&lt;ref name=ajc111611 /&gt; On November 16, 2011, one of the five Superior Court judges in Williams' circuit district stated Judge Williams had stepped down from her drug court position and would stop hearing criminal cases until the investigation has been completed.&lt;ref name=ajc111611 /&gt; Williams continued to work on civil cases previously assigned to her but did not accept new case assignments.&lt;ref name=ajc111611 /&gt;

===Resignation===
Judge Williams sent a letter to Georgia Governor [[Nathan Deal]] in mid-December 2011, indicating her intention to step down from the bench effective January 2, 2012.&lt;ref name="ajc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rankin|first=Bill|title=Brunswick judge facing charges to step down from bench|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/brunswick-judge-facing-charges-1265584.html|newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The JQC agreed to drop charges after Williams tendered her resignation. She also signed a [[Consent decree|consent order]] prohibiting her from seeking judicial office, effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Terry: [http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2011-12-20/story/judge-amanda-williams-quitting-hearing-judicial-misconduct-charges "Judge Amanda Williams quitting before hearing on judicial misconduct charges"] Florida Times-Union, December 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Georgia Attorney General [[Sam Olens]] appointed a special prosecutor to determine if Williams should face felony criminal charges for  allegedly lying to JQC investigators. A conviction would result in forfeiture of an annual $74,000 state pension and disbarment.&lt;ref&gt;Stepzinski, Teresa: [http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2011-12-21/story/special-prosecutor-possible-brunswick-judge-misconduct-case "Special prosecutor possible in the Brunswick judge misconduct case"] Florida Times-Union, December 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Terry: [http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2012-01-10/story/special-prosecutor-named-former-judge-amanda-f-williams-misconduct-case "Special prosecutor named in former Judge Amanda F.

==Award==
In February 2012, [[Long Island University]] announced that "Very Tough Love" won a 2011 [[George Polk Award]] for Radio Reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liu.edu/About/News/Univ-Ctr-PR/2012/February/Polk-PR_Feb-20-2012.aspx |title=Polk Press Release Feb 20 2012 – Long Island University |publisher=Liu.edu |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
On February 22, 2012, the woman whose case prompted Glass to investigate and broadcast the "Very Tough Love" episode was released from probation by Glynn County Magistrate Timothy Barton, who replaced Williams. He also purged two forgery convictions from Lindsey Dill's record as per the Georgia conditional discharge statute. When asked to comment, Barton stated, "I thought seven years was long enough."&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Terry: [http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2012-02-29/story/woman-heart-ethics-case-against-former-glynn-county-judge-released "Woman at heart of ethics case against former Glynn County judge released from probation"] Florida Times-Union, February 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Homicide}}

'''Voluntary manslaughter''' is the killing of a human being in which the offender acted during ''the heat of passion'', under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or [[mentally disturbed]] to the point that they can't reasonably control their emotions.&lt;ref name="elal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Are Homicide and Murder|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-are-homicide-and-murder|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=9 September 2017|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voluntary manslaughter is one of two main types of [[manslaughter]], the other being [[involuntary manslaughter]].

== Provocation ==
Provocation consists of the reasons for which one person kills another. "Adequate" or "reasonable" provocation is what makes the difference between voluntary manslaughter and murder. Provocation is said to be adequate if it would cause a reasonable person to lose self-control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smalleger|first1=Frank|last2=Hall|first2=Daniel|title=Criminal Law Today|date=2015|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=0133008584|edition=5|url=https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Schmalleger-Criminal-Law-Today-Plus-My-CJ-Lab-with-Pearson-e-Text-Access-Card-Package-5th-Edition/PGM157525.html|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State of mind==

===Intent to kill===
Voluntary manslaughter requires the same [[intention (criminal law)|intent]] as murder. The charge of murder is reduced to manslaughter when the defendant's [[culpability]] for the crime is "negated" or mitigated by adequate [[provocation (legal)|provocation]].&lt;ref name=mire&gt;Scott Mire and Cliff Roberson, The Study of Violent Crime: Its Correlates and Concerns (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2011), 138&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperfect self-defense ===

In some jurisdictions, malice can also be negated by imperfect [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]], the principle that an honest but unreasonable belief that it is necessary to defend yourself from imminent peril to life or great bodily injury negates malice aforethought, the  mental  element  necessary   for  a murder charge,  so  that  the  chargeable  offense  is  reduced  to manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grossman|first1=Jonathan|title=Defense Theories and Instructions|url=http://www.sdap.org/downloads/research/criminal/defense08.pdf|website=Sixth District Appellate Program|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-defense is considered imperfect when extenuating circumstances exist that are insufficient to constitute a complete legal defense to homicide, but nonetheless partially excuse the act that resulted in death.&lt;ref name="elal"/&gt;

==Model Penal Code==
The [[Model Penal Code]] (MPC) does not use the common law language of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Under the MPC, a homicide that would otherwise be murder is reduced to manslaughter when committed "under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse".&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Model Penal Code § 210.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-024307-4| last = Dubber| first = Markus D.| title = An Introduction to the Model Penal Code| date = 2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several court decisions in various jurisdictions have interpreted this language broadly by creating a subjective standard to determine whether the provocation was adequate from the defendant's point of view. This subjective standard diverges substantially from the common law [[reasonable person]] test and allows the jury greater latitude.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Brody, James R. Acker &amp; Wayne A. Logan, Criminal Law 353 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[State v. Dumlao]], the court interpreted the MPC language broadly, holding that reasonableness should be evaluated from the defendant's perspective. The subjective standard for whether a provocation was reasonable, and thus adequate, would allow a jury to consider Dumlao's "mental abnormalities", including a medical diagnosis of "paranoid personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-977330-5| last = Farahany| first = Nita| title = The Impact of Behavioral Sciences on Criminal Law| date = 2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''windtower (wind catcher)''' ({{lang-ar|ملقف}} "malqaf", {{lang-fa|بادگیر}} ''bâdgir'': ''bâd'' "wind" + ''gir'' "catcher") is a traditional [[Iranian architecture|Iranian architectural element]] to create [[natural ventilation]] in buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malone|first=Alanna|title=The Windcatcher House|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/features/humanitariandesign/united-states/The-Windcatcher-House.asp|work=Architectural Record: Building for Social Change|publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windcatchers come in various designs: uni-directional, bi-directional, and multi-directional. The devices were used in [[ancient Iranian architecture]]. Windcatchers remain present in Iran and can also be found in traditional Persian-influenced architecture throughout the [[West Asia]], including in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] (mostly Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMldAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq |title=Folklore and Folklife in the United Arab Emirates|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Pakistan, and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=azami&gt;{{cite web|title=Badgir in traditional Iranian architecture|url=http://www.inive.org/members_area/medias/pdf/Inive%5Cpalenc%5C2005%5CAzami2.pdf|publisher=International Conference "Passive and Low Energy Cooling 1021 for the Built Environment", May 2005, Santorini, Greece|accessdate=21 March 2012|author=A. A'zami|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Central [[Iran]] shows large [[diurnal temperature variation]] with an [[arid climate]]. Most buildings are constructed from thick [[ceramic]] with high [[insulation value]]s. Towns centered on desert [[oases]] tend to be packed very closely together with high walls and ceilings, maximizing shade at ground level. The heat of direct sunlight is minimized with small windows that face away from the sun.&lt;ref name=azami/&gt;

The windcatcher's effectiveness had led to its routine use as a refrigerating device in [[Persian architecture]]. Many traditional water reservoirs (''[[ab anbar]]s'') are built with windcatchers that are capable of storing water at near freezing temperatures during summer months. The [[evaporative cooling]] effect is strongest in the driest climates, such as on the Iranian plateau, leading to the ubiquitous use of windcatchers in drier areas such as [[Yazd]], [[Kerman]],  [[Kashan]], [[Sirjan]],  [[Nain, Iran|Nain]], and [[Bam, Iran|Bam]].

A small windcatcher is called a ''shish-khan'' in traditional Persian architecture. Shish-khans can still be seen on top of ab anbars in [[Qazvin]] and other northern cities in Iran. These seem to function more as ventilators than as the temperature regulators seen in the central deserts of Iran.

==Structure and architecture==
Windcatchers tend to have one, four, or eight openings. In the city of Yazd, all windcatchers are four- or eight-sided. The construction of a windcatcher depends on the direction of airflow at that specific location: if the wind tends to blow from only one side, it is built with only one downwind opening. This is the style most commonly seen in [[Meybod]], 50 kilometers from Yazd: the windcatchers are short and have a single opening.

==Function==
[[File:malqaf.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A windcatcher or ''malqaf'' used in traditional Persian/Arabic architecture]]
The windcatcher can function in three ways: directing airflow downward using direct wind entry, directing airflow upwards using a wind-assisted temperature gradient, or directing airflow upwards using a solar-assisted temperature gradient.

===Downward airflow due to direct wind entry===

One of the most common uses of the windcatcher is to cool the inside of the dwelling; it is often used in combination with [[courtyards]] and [[dome]]s as an overall ventilation and heat-management strategy. It is essentially a tall, capped tower with one face open at the top. This open side faces the prevailing wind, thus "catching" it, and brings it down the tower into the heart of the building to maintain air flow, thus cooling the building interior. It does not necessarily cool the air itself, but rather relies on the rate of airflow to provide a cooling effect. Windcatchers have been employed in this manner for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fathy|first=Hassan|title=Natural Energy and Vernacular Architecture|chapter=The wind factor in air movement|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80a01e/80A01E00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Qanat wind tower.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|A windcatcher and qanat used for cooling]]

===Upward airflow due to temperature gradient===

====Wind-assisted temperature gradient====

Windcatchers are also used in combination with a [[qanat]], or underground canal. In this method, the open side of the tower faces away from the direction of the prevailing wind (the tower's orientation can be adjusted by directional ports at the top). By keeping only this tower open, air is drawn upwards using the [[Coandă effect]].

The pressure differential on one side of the building causes air to be drawn down into the passage on the other side. The hot air is brought down into the qanat tunnel and is cooled by coming into contact with the cool earth&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The earth stays cool by virtue of being several meters below the surface&lt;/ref&gt; and cold water running through the qanat. The cooled air is drawn up through the windcatcher, again by the Coandă effect. On the whole, the cool air flows through the building, decreasing the structure's overall temperature. The effect is magnified by the [[evaporative cooling]] of water vapor when the air passes through the qanat water canal, as the water that evaporates in the canal has a large [[enthalpy of vaporization]] and, besides, the dry air is humidified by the evaporated water from the canal before entering the building.

====Solar-produced temperature gradient====

In a windless environment or waterless house, a windcatcher functions as a [[solar chimney]] It creates a [[pressure gradient]] which allows hot air, which is less dense, to travel upwards and escape out the top. This is also compounded significantly by the [[diurnal cycle]], trapping cool air below. The temperature in such an environment cannot drop below the nightly low temperature.

When coupled with thick [[adobe]] that exhibits good [[R-value (insulation)|resistance against heat transmission]], the windcatcher is able to chill lower-level spaces in mosques and houses (e.g. [[shabestan]]s) in the middle of the day to frigid temperatures.

Directing airflow upwards using wind-assisted or solar-produced temperature gradients has gained some ground in Western architecture, and there are several commercial products using the name ''windcatcher''.

==Modern applications==

The windcatcher approach has recently been utilized in Western architecture, such as in the visitor center at [[Zion National Park]], [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/zion/learn/nature/zion-canyon-visitor-center.htm|title=Zion Canyon Visitor Center|last=|first=|date=|website=National Park Service - Zion National Park|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it functions without the addition of mechanical devices in order to regulate temperature.&lt;ref name=bigcity&gt;{{cite web|title=How Ancient Persian Architecture Captured Wind Energy Underground to Green Buildings|url=http://thisbigcity.net/how-ancient-persian-architecture-captured-wind-energy-underground-to-green-buildings/|publisher=This Big City.net|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using aluminum for the windcatcher provides a more efficient capturing system, allowing for wind capture from multiple directions. The [[Kensington Oval]] cricket ground in [[Barbados]] and the [[Saint-Étienne Métropole]]'s [[Zénith de Saint-Étienne|Zénith]] both use this method.&lt;ref name=bigcity /&gt;

{{History of Algeria}}
The '''Évian Accords''' comprise a [[treaty]] which was signed on 18 March 1962 in [[Évian-les-Bains]], France by [[French Fifth Republic|France]] and the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic]], the government-in-exile of [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] (''Front de Libération Nationale'') which sought Algeria's independence from France. The Accords ended the 1954–1962 [[Algerian War]] with a formal ceasefire proclaimed for 19 March, and formalized the idea of cooperative exchange between the two countries.

==Content of Évian Accords==

The Évian Accords consisted of 93 pages of detailed agreements and arrangements. In essence these covered cease-fire arrangements, prisoner releases, the recognition of full sovereignty and right to self-determination of Algeria, in addition to guarantees of protection, non-discrimination and property rights for all Algerian citizens. A section dealing with military issues provided for the withdrawal of French forces over a period of two years, with the exception of those garrisoning the French military base of [[Mers El Kébir]] (see below). Other provisions pledged that there would be no sanctions for any acts committed prior to the ceasefire.

French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] wanted to maintain French interests in the area, including industrial and commercial primacy and control over Saharan [[oil reserves]].  In addition, the European French community (the ''colon'' population), the ''[[pieds-noirs]]'' and [[History of the Jews in Algeria|indigenous Sephardi Jews]] in Algeria were guaranteed religious freedom and property rights as well as French citizenship with the option to choose between French and Algerian citizenship after three years.  In exchange, Algeria received access to technical assistance and financial aid from the French government.  Algerians were permitted to continue freely circulating between their country and France for work, although they would not have political rights equal to French citizens. The [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]] right-wing movement opposed the negotiations through a series of bombings and an assassination attempt against De Gaulle at [[Clamart]] in Paris in August 1962.

The agreements included an article which stated that "''Algeria concedes to France the use of certain air bases, terrains, sites and military installations which are necessary to it [France].''" The agreement specifically permitted France to maintain its naval facilities at [[Mers El Kébir]] (which also had an [[France and nuclear weapons|underground nuclear testing facility]]) for another fifteen years; France chose to withdraw from the base in 1967, however, only five years after the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Horne, ''A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The vote==
In a [[French Évian Accords referendum, 1962|referendum]] held on 8 April 1962, the French electorate approved the Accords, with almost 91% in favour.  The final result was 17,866,423 in favour of Algerian independence, and 1,809,074 against.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france-politique.fr/referendum-1962-algerie.htm france-politique.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July, the Accords were subject to a [[Algerian Évian Accords referendum, 1962|second referendum]] in Algeria, where with 5,975,581 voted for independence and just 16,534 against.&lt;ref&gt;

==Outcome of Agreements==
The historian [[Alistair Horne]] comments that most provisions of the agreements were to be overtaken by events.&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Horne, page 521 ''A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962', {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}'&lt;/ref&gt; The wholesale exodus of almost all of the million-strong [[Pied-Noir|European community]] immediately prior to independence made the three year transition clauses a dead letter, while the widespread killings of Muslims who had served as auxiliaries ([[harkis]]) with the French Army was in direct contravention of the amnesty provisions of the treaty.
