[[Cornelius Ryan]]'s '''''A Bridge Too Far''''' gives an account of [[Operation Market Garden]], a failed [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] attempt to break through German lines at [[Arnhem]] in the occupied Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The title of the book comes from a comment made by British Lieutenant General [[Frederick Browning]], deputy commander of the [[First Allied Airborne Army]], who told [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] before the operation, "I think we may be going a bridge too far."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryan |first=Cornelius |author-link=Cornelius Ryan |title=A Bridge Too Far |p=67 |year=1974 |location=London |publisher=Hamish Hailton |edition=first |isbn=0-241-89073-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on a wide variety of sources, Ryan also documented his account of the 1944 battle with pictures and maps and included a section on the survivors, “Soldiers and Civilians – What They Do Today”. One particular focus was on the tactical mistakes made in planning the operation. Until Ryan's book, Market Garden had been a classic example of victors writing the history. Popular accounts of World War II usually tended not to mention the battle at all or put Montgomery's spin on it as being a "partial success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.army.mod.uk/para/history/arnhem.htm |title=The Battle for Arnhem |publisher=The Parachute Regiment |accessdate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626112415/http://www.army.mod.uk/para/history/arnhem.htm |archivedate=26 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1974 book was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in New York and by Hamish Hamilton in London. There were frequent later editions, and a [[A Bridge Too Far (film)|film]] based on it was released in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = William Goldman's Story of a Bridge Too Far | first = William | last = Goldman | year = 1977 | author-link = William Goldman | publisher = [[Coronet Books]] | isbn = 0-340-22340-5 | ref = harv}} [NB: Book has no page numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agnes Ethel Conway''' (1885–1950) was a British historian and archaeologist who worked in the Middle East from 1929-1936.  She was noted for her work with her husband [[George Horsfield]] at [[Petra]] and Kilwa, and produced detailed studies of the history of her father's castle, [[Allington Castle|Allington]], in [[Kent]] which had been owned by the Wyatt family in the 16th century.

== Personal life ==
Agnes Conway was born on 2 May 1885 to [[William Martin Conway]] and Katrina Conway (née Lombard).
She attended Baker Street High School and Kings College before becoming a student at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]] in 1903. She studied for a History Tripos while also having tutorials in Greek from [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], then Lecturer in Classical Archaeology at Newnham. Her father bought [[Allington Castle]] in Kent in 1905, and began a lengthy restoration of the castle in the following years.
  
Agnes passed both parts of her ''History Tripos'' by 1907 and continued her tutorials in Greek with Harrison with a view to studying archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thornton | first1 = Amara | year = 2011 | title = The Allure of Archaeology: Agnes Conway and Jane Harrison at Newnham College, 1903–1907 | url = | journal = Bulletin of the History of Archaeology | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 37–56 | doi = 10.5334/bha.2114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She added to and catalogued her father's growing collection of photographs, working with [[Eugenie Sellers Strong]] at the [[British School at Rome]] in 1912 on this project. Admitted as a student of the [[British School at Athens]] for the 1913/1914 session, she travelled widely in Greece and the Balkans in 1914 with a friend, Evelyn Radford, who had also attended Newnham. Conway published an account of the journey, entitled ''A Ride Through the Balkans, on Classic Ground with a Camera'' in 1917.

From 1917-1929, Conway worked on gathering materials representing women's work in the First World War as the chair of the Women's Work Sub-Committee of the newly established [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name="Beyond"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Speck|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2014|title=Beyond the Battlefield, Women Artists of Two World Wars|ISBN=978 178023 374 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Martin Conway, had been appointed the honorary Director-General of the Museum.&lt;ref name="Beyond"/&gt; She also attended classes at the [[Institute of Historical Research]], where she studied the relationship of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] with Scotland and Ireland, for which she was awarded an M. A. degree from the [[University of London]]. For this project she spent much time at the [[British Museum]] Reading Room and the Public Records Office.

Conway visited [[Petra]] for the first time in 1928, accompanying family friends on an extensive trip through [[Egypt]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] and [[Iraq]]. Struck by its beauty, she went back to Allington determined to do further research and write up her journey for publication. She contacted [[George Horsfield]], Chief Inspector of Antiquities for the Transjordan Government, in order to find out more about the site; eventually becoming part of a team of archaeologists, including Horsfield, [[Tawfiq Canaan]], a Palestinian physician, and Dr Detlief Nielsen, from Copenhagen, to explore Petra in detail in March 1929. Conway lectured on Petra at the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1930. She kept in touch with Horsfield over the results of the excavation, and the two developed a close relationship, resulting in their marriage in St George's Cathedral, [[Jerusalem]], on 29 January 1932.

'''Amarna letter EA 323''', titled: ''A Royal Order for Glass,''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 252, ''"A  Royal Order for Glass"'', pp. 321-23.&lt;/ref&gt; is a smaller, square, mostly flat [[clay tablet]] letter written on both sides, but only half of the ''reverse''; it is also written on the bottom, and is a letter from 'governor' [[Yidya]], and is a short letter like many of his other [[Amarna letters]], numbered [[Amarna letter EA 320|EA 320]] to [[Amarna letter EA 326|EA 326]].

EA 323 is so short that it can be described as: a [[prostration formula]] to the Pharaoh (the letter is written to the King/Pharaoh), a statement of him guarding his [[city-state]] of [[Ashkelon]]-(Ašqaluna of the letters), and the subject of delivering ''glass'' to the King of Egypt.

The clay tablet letter is located at the [[British Museum]], no. BM 29836. (Obverse, see here:[https://www.britishmuseum.org/collectionimages/AN00149//AN00149403_001_l.jpg])

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city Akhetaten, in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the body of letters.

==The letter==

'''Archaeoparasitology''', a multi-disciplinary field within [[paleopathology]], is the study of [[parasitism|parasites]] in [[Archaeology|archaeological]] contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Reinhard KJ, Araújo A |chapter=Archaeoparasitology |editor=Pearsall, Deborah M. |title=Encyclopedia of Archaeology |publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2008 |pages=494–501 |isbn=978-0-12-548030-7 |volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It includes studies of the [[protozoa]]n and [[animal|metazoan]] parasites of humans in the past, as well as parasites which may have affected past human societies, such as those infesting domesticated animals.

Reinhard suggested that the term "archaeoparasitology" be applied to "... all parasitological remains excavated from archaeological contexts ... derived from human activity" and that "the term '[[paleoparasitology]]' be applied to studies of nonhuman, paleontological material."

The first archaeoparasitology report described calcified eggs of [[Schistosoma haematobium|''Bilharzia haematobia'' (now ''Schistosoma haematobium'')]] from the kidneys of an ancient Egyptian mummy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ruffer MA |title=Note on the presence of ''Bilharzia haematobia'' in Egyptian mummies of the Twentieth Dynasty (1250–1000 BC) |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |pages=16 |year=1910 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2557.16-a |issue=2557}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Since then, many fundamental archaeological questions have been answered by integrating our knowledge of the [[host (biology)|hosts]], [[parasitic life cycles|life cycles]] and basic biology of parasites, with the [[archaeology|archaeological]], [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[history|historical]] contexts in which they are found.

==Parasitology basics==

[[Parasitism|Parasite]]s are organisms which live in close association with another organism, called the host, in which the parasite benefits from the association, to the detriment of the [[host (biology)|host]].  Many other kinds of associations may exist between two closely allied organisms, such as [[commensalism]] or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].

[[Parasitism#Types|Endoparasites]] (such as [[protozoa]]ns and [[parasitic worm|helminths]]), tend to be found inside the host, while [[Parasitism#Types|ectoparasites]] (such as [[tick]]s, [[lice]] and [[flea]]s) live on the outside of the host body.  [[parasitic life cycles|Parasite life cycles]] often require that different developmental stages pass sequentially through multiple host species in order to successfully mature and reproduce.  Some parasites are very [[host (biology)|host]]-specific, meaning that only one or a few species of hosts are capable of perpetuating their life cycle.  Others are not host-specific, since many different hosts appear to harbor and pass on the infective stages of the parasite.

Most archaeoparasitology reports involve species which are considered to be true parasites of humans today. However, incidental parasitism (referred to by some authors as "pseudoparasitism", "false parasitism" or "accidental parasitism") occurs when a parasite which does not normally utilize a host for the perpetuation of its lifecycle is found in that host incidentally.  One example is finding the eggs of ''Cryptocotyle lingua'' (a fish parasite) in the stomach contents of an Eskimo [[mummy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Zimmerman MR |chapter=Aleutian and Alaskan mummies |editor1=Cockburn, Eve |editor2=Cockburn, Aidan |title=Mummies, disease, and ancient cultures |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1980 |pages=118–134 |isbn=978-0-521-23020-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is estimated that 70% of the "parasite" species reported from present-day humans are actually only incidental parasites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ashford RW |title=The human parasite fauna: towards an analysis and interpretation |journal=Ann Trop Med Parasitol |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=189–98 |date=February 1991 |pmid=1888215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some incidental parasites do cause harm to the infested pseudohosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sing A, Tybus K, Fackler I |title=Acute urticaria associated with ''Dicrocoelium dendriticum'' infestation |journal=Indian J Med Microbiol |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=97–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18227619 |url=http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2008;volume=26;issue=1;spage=97;epage=98;aulast=Sing |doi=10.4103/0255-0857.38879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of material==

In archaeological contexts, endoparasites (or their eggs or cysts) are usually found in (i) fossilized human or animal dung ([[coprolites]]), (ii) the tissues and digestive contents of [[mummies|mummified]] corpses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nezamabadi M, Mashkour M, Aali A, Stöllner T, Le Bailly M |title=IDENTIFICATION OF TAENIA SP.

Since 1910, parasite remains have been found in archaeological samples from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and New Zealand.  The age of archaeological sites yielding human parasite remains ranges from approx. 25,000-30,000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bouchet F, Baffier D, Girard M, Morel P, Paicheler J, David F |title=Paléoparasitologie en contexte pléistocène premières observations à la Grande Grotte d'Arcy-sur-Cure (Yonne), France |journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Série III |volume=319 |issue=2 |pages=147–51 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; to late 19th-early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reinhard KJ, Araújo A, Sianto L, Costello JG, Swope K |title=Chinese liver flukes in latrine sediments from Wong Nim's property, San Bernardino, California: archaeoparasitology of the Caltrans District Headquarters |journal=J.

Human skeletal remains may exhibit indirect evidence of parasitism.  For example, [[hookworm]] (''Ancyslostoma duodenale'') parasitism may lead to [[anemia]], and anemia is one factor associated with the skeletal changes of cribra orbitalia and [[porotic hyperostosis]].  Thus, hookworm parasitism ''may'' be a causal factor in observed cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carlson D, Armelagos G, Van Gerven D |title=Factors influencing the etiology of cribra orbitalia in prehistoric Nubia |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=405–10 |year=1974 |doi=10.1016/0047-2484(74)90203-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  though dietary factors may also lead to anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holland TD, O'Brien MJ |title=Parasites, porotic hyperostosis, and the implications of changing perspectives |journal=Am Antiq. |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=183–93 |year=1997 |doi=10.2307/282505 |jstor=282505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information on the presence of [[host (biology)|intermediate hosts]], required for life cycle completion by many parasites, is also useful in determining the likelihood that a parasite may have infected a particular ancient society.  One example is the identification of molluscan intermediate hosts of [[schistosomiasis]] in an Islamic archaeological context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Insoll T, Hutchins E |title=The archaeology of disease: Molluscs as potential disease indicators in Bahrain |journal=World Archaeology |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=579–88 |year=2005 |url=http://www.insoll.org/Bahrain%20Disease.pdf |doi=10.1080/00438240500411230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts depicting the appearance of individuals may also indicate cases of parasitism.  Examples include the characteristic facial deformities of [[leishmaniasis]] found on pre-Columbian [[Moche (culture)|Mochica]] pottery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Serarcangeli C, Pennica A |title=Testimonianze di una malattia autoctona nella ceramica del Perú precolombiano / Testimonies of an autochthonous illness on the anthropomorphic pottery in ancient Peru |journal=Medicina Nei Secoli |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=125–41 |year=1996 |pmid=11623468}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and morphological features of certain ancient Egyptian [[figurative art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hoeppli R |title=Morphological changes in human schistosomiasis and certain analogies in ancient Egyptian sculpture |journal=Acta Tropica |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=1973 |pmid=4144954|doi=10.5169/seals-311865|url=https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?pid=act-001:1973:30::408 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Literary sources also provide valuable information regarding not only the parasites present in historic societies, but also the knowledge and attitudes that the people had towards their parasitic infestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moule |first=Léon  |title=La parasitologie dans la littérature antique.

'''''Blair Witch''''' is a [[horror film]] [[media franchise|franchise]] distributed by [[Artisan Entertainment]] (now [[Lionsgate]]) and produced by [[Haxan Films]] that consists of three feature films and various merchandise products. The development of the franchise's first installment, ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', started in 1993. The filmmakers Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick wrote a 35-page outline of a story with the dialogue to be improvised. Filming began in 1997 and lasted eight days. The film follows the disappearance of three student filmmakers in the woods near [[Burkittsville, Maryland]] while shooting a documentary on the local legend known as the "Blair Witch".

After premiering at the 1999 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the film was released on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity during a controversial promotional campaign. The film went on to be a massive commercial success, and a sequel, ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2]]'', was released on October 27, 2000. A second official sequel, ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]'', was released on September 16, 2016. Series of video games, books, novels and comic books were released to accompany the films.

==Faux legend==
The backstory for the movie is a [[wikt:faux|faux]] legend fabricated by Sánchez and Myrick which is detailed in ''The Curse of the Blair Witch'', a [[mockumentary]] broadcast on the [[SyFy Channel|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 1999 prior to the release of ''The Blair Witch Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curse of the Blair witch|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/10/29/curse-blair-witch|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanchez and Myrick also maintained a website at BlairWitch.com which added further details to the legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blairwitch.com/mythology.html|title=The Blair Witch|accessdate=4 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707140445/http://www.blairwitch.com/mythology.html|archivedate=7 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the official site of the [[Blair Witch (film)|2016 installment]].

The fictional tale describes the murders and disappearances of some of the residents of Blair, Maryland (the fictitious former name of [[Burkittsville, Maryland]]) from the [[18th century]] to the [[20th century]]. According to the legend, residents always blame these occurrences on the ghost of Elly Kedward (also a fictitious person), a Blair resident executed in 1785 by [[Hypothermia|exposure]] for practicing [[witchcraft]]. The mockumentary presents the legend as real, complete with manufactured newspaper articles, [[newsreels]], television news reports, and staged interviews, all in an attempt to deceive viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curse of the Blair Witch|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/10/29/curse-blair-witch|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Blair Witch Project'' (1999)===
{{Main|The Blair Witch Project}}
Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard, student filmmakers, set out to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. In the Black Hills forest near Burkittsville, Maryland, many children have vanished in the 1940s and people still avoid going too deep into the woods. The party sets out to look for facts that prove the legend, equipped only with two cameras and a little hiking gear. First, they find little piles of stone that must have been arranged artificially, later, they find themselves lost in the woods. Eerie sounds at night and more piles of stones in places where they have not been before cause the already desperate group to panic. One night, days after they should have been back home, Josh disappears. While searching for Josh, Heather and Mike find a derelict house in a clearing and go inside, where they see runic symbols on the wall next to child-sized handprints. Josh's voice seems to be coming from somewhere inside the house, and Mike rushes upstairs. Mike then realizes that the voice is now coming from the basement, and rushes down the steps. Suddenly, Mike is rendered silent and the camera falls. Hysterical, Heather follows and sees Mike in the corner of the room, faced against a wall. Suddenly Heather's camera is knocked down and she too is rendered silent. The film runs for a few seconds, then dies.

===''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' (2000)===
{{Main|Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2}}
''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' returns to Maryland's Black Hills region in the wake of ''The Blair Witch Project'' and the prodigious media coverage devoted to its conflation of documentary style and supernatural legend, fans and curiosity-seekers have descended upon the movie's real-life setting of Burkittsville, Maryland. Jeff Patterson ([[Jeffrey Donovan]]), a black-sheep "townie" only recently released from a mental institution, has turned his obsession with the Blair Witch into a business and has lured four young people to Burkittsville for a tour of the Witch's purported Black Hills' haunts. Jeff's clients are also fixated on the film, for reasons they themselves may not fully comprehend. Erica Geerson ([[Erica Leerhsen]]) is a practicing Wiccan who has immersed herself in Blair Witch mythology, even though she decries the film's portrayal of her fellow witches. Grad students Tristen Ryler ([[Tristine Skyler]]) and Stephen Ryan Parker ([[Stephen Barker Turner]]) are writing a book about the Blair Witch, but disagree completely about the story's basis in fact, with folklorist Tristen arguing that it must contain some grain of truth while Stephen insists it's a textbook case of mass hysteria. Completing the group is Kim Diamond ([[Kim Director]]), a hard-edged, sardonic Goth aficionado possessed of striking psychic abilities.

After spending a strange and disorienting night at one of the most sinister sites in Blair Witch lore, the five campers awake to a scene of destruction and no memory of having gone to sleep. They return to Jeff's abandoned warehouse loft to try to piece together what happened. But as Jeff leads Erica, Tristen, Stephen and Kim across the rickety drawbridge and unlocks the metal door to a chorus of barking dogs, they are entering a place no safer than the woods they just left. Inside, the legend seems to begin to bleed into reality as their mass hysteria ensues. Erica mysteriously disappears and Tristen ends up hanging herself from the second floor railing of the warehouse.

The end of the film reveals that Jeff, Stephen, and Kim have been arrested. Each is interrogated separately, with the police showing each person footage of their crimes. Security camera footage shows Kim stabbing a cashier in the neck. Surveillance camera footage shows a naked Jeff killing Erica, arranging her clothes, and putting her dead body in the closet. Jeff's video shows Stephen assaulting Tristen, pushing her over the second floor banister, and accusing her of being a witch. All three, close to a nervous breakdown, proclaim their innocence.

The tie-in [[mockumentary]] to ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Blair Witch]]'', establishes the events of the film being a [[play within a play|film within a film]]; the in-universe mockumentary reveals that ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' is "a film adaptation" based on the "Black Hills murders" that took place shortly after the release of ''The Blair Witch Project''. ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows "the real James Patterson"'s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to fictionalize the case's events for the big screen from the defense's point-of-view. Protests of the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are discussed within the documentary coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the Wiccan community as a whole. Rachel Moskowitz and Andre Brooks respectively portray the "real" Kim Diamond and Jeffrey Patterson within the documentary.

===''Blair Witch'' (2016)===
{{Main|Blair Witch (film)}}
On September 2, 2009, Ed Sánchez and [[Daniel Myrick]] announced their intent to produce a third ''Blair Witch'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eduardo Sanchez Talks Seventh Moon, Plans for Blair Witch 3 |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3#axzz2iX51dPIe|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8187275.stm| title = The legend of the Witch lives on: Interview| accessdate = 2009-08-11| work = news.bbc.co.uk | date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a sequel to the first film, would potentially contain the actors from the first film in some context, and would not reference any of the events from ''Book of Shadows''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Blair Witch Returns?|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/33871/eduardo-sanchez-talks-seventh-moon-plans-blair-witch-3#axzz2iX51dPIe|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Sánchez remarked that further development on a sequel depended on getting Lionsgate to approve the idea and for his and Myrick's schedule to match up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Blair Witch Project 3 Moves Forward Says Eduardo Sanchez|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-blair-witch-project-3-moves-forward-says-eduardo-sanchez|publisher=Movie Web|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went into [[development hell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Planned Horror Movie Sequels We're Still Waiting to See |url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/list/10-planned-horror-movie-sequels-were-still-waiting-see|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2015, a third ''Blair Witch'' was still in talks. Sanchez stated that the film was "inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/85523/exclusive-eduardo-sanchez-talks-blair-witch-3-coming-sooner-rather-later/ | title = Eduardo Sanchez Talks Blair Witch 3 | author = Steve Barton | publisher = ''Dread Central'' | date = January 14, 2015 | accessdate = April 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, it was revealed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic Con|San Diego Comic-Con]] that the film marketed with the faux-title ''The Woods'', actually turned out to be the sequel ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/22/blair-witch-project-sequel-secret-comic-con | title = Blair Witch trailer: Sequel release date set for September | author = Clark Collis | publisher = ''Entertainment Weekly'' | date = July 22, 2016 | accessdate = July 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on September 16, 2016.

==Mockumentaries==
Four mockumentaries on the ''Blair Witch'' were produced to promote the films. The first being ''Curse of the Blair Witch'' which aired on the [[Syfy Channel]] in 1999, prior to the release of ''The Blair Witch Project'', and the second being ''Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend'' which overlaps quite a bit with ''Curse of the Blair Witch''. The latter two documentaries, ''The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy'' and ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'', both directed by [[Ben Rock]], aired in 2000.

===''Curse of the Blair Witch'' (1999)===
Before the release of ''The Blair Witch Project'' in 1999, the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] aired a 45-minute mockumentary about the Blair Witch called ''Curse of the Blair Witch''.

The program offers firsthand interviews with several fictional colleagues and relatives of Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Michael Williams, including their Montgomery College film professor.

One of the highlights of the video is the first mention of Elly Kedward, the woman who would go on to become the Blair Witch.

''Curse of the Blair Witch'' was created to give credibility to the idea that the events of ''The Blair Witch Project'' actually occurred, which was how the film was marketed upon its initial release.

===''Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend'' (1999)===
Directed by [[Daniel Myrick]] and [[Eduardo Sánchez (director)|Eduardo Sánchez]], considered for inclusion in the theatrical release of ''The Blair Witch Project'' and released to [[VHS]] as part of a special promotion that ran when ''The Blair Witch Project'' was released on home video, ''Sticks and Stones'' runs 30 minutes and overlaps with the mockumentary ''Curse of the Blair Witch''. The mockumentary primarily consists of alternate cuts of many of the previous films' interviews, but there is some new material to be found, including a brief 1995 conversation with [[Joshua Leonard]]'s father about his son's disappearance.

''Sticks and Stones'' also includes an extended conversation between [[Heather Donahue]] and [[Michael C. Williams|Michael Williams]] from a [[deleted scene]], that was cut from the theatrical release of ''The Blair Witch Project''.

===''The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy'' (2000)===
When ''The Blair Witch Project'' premiered on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], it was accompanied by a new 40-minute Blair Witch mockumentary named ''The Burkittsville 7'', which delved into the murder case of Rustin Parr that was mentioned in ''The Blair Witch Project''. Within the mockumentary it is theorised that Kyle Brody, the lone survivor of the murders, may have himself been involved in the murders. Within the mockumentary, it is mentioned that after Parr was hanged, Brody grew up to become a troubled adult who spent most of the latter part of his life in mental institutions before committing [[suicide]] in the year 1971.

===''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' (2000)===
Directed by [[Ben Rock]], and airing on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in conjunction with the release of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'', the mockumentary ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' takes an objective look at the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2''. Running 45 minutes, it examines the troubled life of "the real Jeff Patterson" and his obsession with ''The Blair Witch Project''. Within the documentary, the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are presented as a film adaptation based on the "Black Hills murders" that took place shortly after the events of ''The Blair Witch Project''. This documentary presents ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' as a film within a film.

''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows "the real James Patterson"'s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to [[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|fictionalize the case's events for the big screen]]. Protests of the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are discussed coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the [[Wiccan]] community as a whole.

==Books==
In September 1999, D.A. Stern compiled ''The Blair Witch Project: A Dossier''. Perpetuating the film's "true story" angle, the dossier consisted of fabricated police reports, pictures, interviews, and newspaper articles presenting the movie's premise as fact, as well as further elaboration on the Elly Kedward and Rustin Parr legends. ''Blair Witch: Book of Shadows'' was released in November, 2000.

==Novels==
Stern wrote the 2000 novel ''Blair Witch: The Secret Confessions of Rustin Parr'' and in 2004, revisited the franchise with the novel ''Blair Witch: Graveyard Shift'', featuring all original characters and plot.

In May 1999, a [[Photonovel]] adaptation of ''The Blair Witch Project'' was written by Claire Forbes and was released by Fotonovel Publications.

===''The Blair Witch Files''===
A series of eight young adult books entitled ''The Blair Witch Files'' were released by [[Random House|Random]] subsidiary [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] from 2000 to 2001. The books center on Cade Merill, a fictional cousin of Heather Donahue, who investigates phenomena related to the Blair Witch in attempt to discover what really happened to Heather, Mike, and Josh.&lt;ref name="Files"&gt;{{cite web |last=Merill |first=Cade |title=Cade Merill's The Blair Witch Files |work=Random House |year=2000 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/blairwitch/home.html |accessdate=2009-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207020654/http://www.randomhouse.com/features/blairwitch/home.html |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1999, [[Oni Press]] released a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic promoting the first film, simply titled ''The Blair Witch Project''. Written by Jen Van Meter and drawn by [[Bernie Mireault]], [[Guy Davis (comics)|Guy Davis]], and [[Tommy Lee Edwards]], the comic featured three short stories elaborating on the mythology of the Blair Witch. In mid-2000, the same group worked on a four-issue series called ''The Blair Witch Chronicles''.

In October 2000, coinciding with the release of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'', [[Image Comics]] released a one-shot called ''Blair Witch: Dark Testaments'', drawn by [[Charlie Adlard]] and written by [[Ian Edginton]].

==Video games==

In 2000, [[Gathering of Developers]] released a [[The Blair Witch Project (video games)|trilogy of computer games]] based on the films, which greatly expanded on the myths suggested in the first film. The graphics engine and characters were all derived from the producer's earlier game ''[[Nocturne (Game)|Nocturne]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jeff. [http://pc.ign.com/articles/078/078038p1.html 'Blair Witch Project Interview'] [[IGN]].com. April 14, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Each game, developed by a different team, focused on different aspects of the Blair Witch mythology: Rustin Parr, Coffin Rock, and Elly Kedward, respectively.

The trilogy received mixed reviews from critics, with most criticism being directed towards the very linear gameplay, clumsy controls and camera angles, and short length. The first volume, ''Rustin Parr'', received the most praise, ranging from moderate to positive, with critics commending its storyline, graphics and atmosphere; some reviewers even claimed that the game was scarier than the movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/blairwitch1rustinparr?q=Blair%20Witch 'Metacritic: Blair Witch Volume 1: Rustin Parr']. Metacritic.&lt;/ref&gt; The following volumes were less well-received, with ''[[PC Gamer]]'' saying that Volume 2's only saving grace was its cheap price&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/blairwitch2coffinrock?q=Blair%20Witch 'Metacritic &amp;ndash; Blair Witch Volume 2'] Metacritic.&lt;/ref&gt; and calling Volume 3 "amazingly mediocre".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/blairwitch3ellykedward?q=Blair%20Witch 'Metacritic &amp;ndash; Blair Witch Volume 3'] Metacritic.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Eduardo Sanchez, director of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' said about the ''Blair Witch'' franchise in 2009:

{{quote|"Ideally, each Blair Witch film would be a completely different kind of movie,", he says. "We've thought about doing a film that takes place in the late 1700s and looks like a [Stanley] Kubrick movie with gritty looking people and lighting."&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8187275.stm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Television series'''''

On October 30, 2017, Sánchez revealed on the Diminishing Returns [[podcast]] that he and the rest of the film's creative team are developing a ''Blair Witch'' television series, though he pointed out that any decisions would ultimately be up to [[Lionsgate]] now that they own the rights to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dimreturns.com/episodes/2017/10/27/74-podcast-of-horror-ii-the-blair-witch-project|title=74 - Podcast of Horror II: The Blair Witch Project|work=Diminishing Returns|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book preservation in developing countries''' is a growing concern among [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] and conservation [[librarians]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. Without proper resources and training, many countries around the world struggle to maintain books and [[manuscripts]] as part of their cultural history. Environmental conditions pose perhaps the greatest threat to these materials. Political instability also endangers library and museum collections. Recent contributions are helping to address specific needs and promote the development of preservation programs.

== Overview ==
All library collections experience damage from use and decay from the aging process. Due to a variety of economic, historic, environmental and political factors, libraries and archival repositories in developing countries face exceptional challenges in book and manuscript preservation. [[Southeast Asia]], [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]] have been identified as areas with materials having critical need for preservation{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. Local librarians and archivists struggle to provide access for patrons while protecting the structural integrity of materials against damage from over-use, neglect, and extreme climate conditions.

This is especially difficult as print materials in developing countries are often created using fragile, non-lasting paper product and ink. Providing information and education about preservation practices and principles is becoming an increasing focus for professionals working in countries with established practices. Going back to at least the year 2000, efforts have been made to establish a decision matrix and guidelines for preservation workers in developing countries to use in implementing preservation and conservation programs.&lt;ref name="Conservation and Preservation Activities in Archives and Libraries in Developing Countries: An Advisory Guideline on Policy and Planning"&gt;[http://www.acarm.org/oid%5Cdownloads%5C4%5C3_1_3_12_00_PM_Conservation%20G...]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts to improve preservation in developing countries==
In August 1985, [[John F. Dean]] became [[Cornell University Library]]'s first preservation and conservation librarian. Dean's efforts helped the Department of Preservation and Conservation at Cornell to grow into one of the leading programs of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v11/bp11-09.html], Cornell University: The Department of Preservation and Conservation Outline of Development, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his work at Cornell, Dean has made important contributions towards improving preservation efforts in developing countries. He has created online tutorials for library conservation and preservation in Southeast Asia and Iraq and the Middle East. The tutorials are designed so that librarians and archivists in these and other countries have a set of basic guidelines to refer to when dealing with preservation issues. Specific topics addressed in the tutorials include "Management and Planning", "Preservation", "Building Capacity" and "Supporting the Effort". Both tutorials are available in English; the tutorial for Iraq and the Middle East is also available in Arabic.

==Area specific problems and actions==
===India===
The advancement of technology and IT professions in [[India]] has resulted in a large number of digital library projects across the country. The main problem these initiatives are running into are access and copyright laws{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

===Puerto Rico===
[[Munoz-Sola]] points out the impracticality of mounting modern environmental controls in a library to stabilize temperature and humidity in the balmy [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munoz-Sola|first=Haydee|date=1987|title=Preservation of Library Materials in a Tropical Climate|url=https://doi.org/10.1300/J122v07n03_05|journal=Science &amp; Technology Libraries|volume=7:3|pages=41–47|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expense involved in creating an ideal environment in both energy and manpower would counteract positive outcomes for the condition of collections. Puerto Rico also has an additional concern with preservation: due to political instability in the past, many libraries and collections have been destroyed, which places a greater need on preserving what is left. Munoz-Sola also points out that many developing countries are in tropical climates, and thus face these problems.

===Ukraine and Bulgaria===
Conservators at the Ukraine V. Stefanyk Scientific Library of the [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine|National Academy of Sciences]] make the effort to adapt advanced preservation techniques to their home area by hiring local craftsmen to manufacture necessary tools and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baird|first=Brian J.|last2=Schaffner|first2=Bradley L.|title=Slow Fires Still Burn: Results of a Preservation Assessment of Libraries in L’viv, Ukraine, and Sofia, Bulgaria {{!}} Baird {{!}} College &amp; Research Libraries|url=http://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/15608|doi=10.5860/crl.64.4.318}}&lt;/ref&gt; This library has a well-established conservation program, with staff trained at workshops in Europe.

The L’viv National University Library in Bulgaria received enough funds from their government to build a new facility to house extra collections and offices. However the new building, with its brand new heating system has caused the collections to deteriorate much more rapidly than those collections stored in the main building which has thick stone walls and a naturally occurring stable environment. These countries are coping with the transition from being under Soviet rule to self-governing states.

[[File:Reproduction cave of Altamira 02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Roof of the [[Cave of Altamira]] (replica) - National Archaeological Museum.]]
The [[Cantabria]]n caves' unique location make them an ideal place to observe the settlements of early humans thousands of years ago. The magnificent art in the caves includes figures of various animals of the time such as [[bison]], [[horse]]s, [[goat]]s, [[deer]], [[cattle]], hands and other paintings. Archaeologists have found remains of animals such as [[bear]]s, the remains of [[arrow]]s and other material indicating a human presence; these artifacts are now found mostly in the Regional Museum of Prehistory and Archaeology of Cantabria.

==With rock art==
&lt;!-- add in alphabetic order --&gt;

===Las Aguas===
The cave of Las Aguas is located near the town of [[Novales]], in the municipality of [[Alfoz de Lloredo]]. This cave contains [[rock art]], including two bison carved and painted in red, a doe, a horse, a clavate (club), a sign on the grill and several more configurations. These remains have been dated to the early or middle [[Magdalenian]] period.

===Altamira===
[[File:Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain-110113.jpg|thumb|[[Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain|Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art]] of Northern Spain]]
The [[Cave of Altamira]] is located near [[Santillana del Mar]]. This cave, called the "Sistine Chapel of Quaternary", is relatively small ({{convert|270|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and contains the rock paintings of sixteen bison, several depictions of deer, the largest of which is {{convert|2.25|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and of horses. The cave has been included in [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s since 1985.

===La Clotilde===
The Cave of la Clotilde is located in the town of Santa Isabel de Quijas in the region of [[Reocín]]. Remains suggest that this area was occupied during the [[Magdalenian]] period; its cave paintings date from before the [[Aurignacian]] period, which include representations of animals and other symbols of unknown nature.

===Cualventi===
The cave of Cualventi is located in the town of Peralada, in Oreña in the municipality [[Alfoz of Lloredo]] dating approximately to the [[Magdalenian]] age. Several red spots can be found using the techniques of "buffered" and "spot" to depict a huge bison, goats, deer and horses very similar to the [[Cave of El Pendo]], Cave of Covalanas and other Cantabrian caves.

===Cullalvera===
Cullalvera Cave is located in the municipality of [[Ramales de la Victoria]], capital of the comarca of [[Asón-Agüera|Valley of the Asón River]]. The entry for this cave near the village arises from a Cantabrian oak&lt;!-- does "encinar" really mean "oak"? --&gt;, and it is part of a karstic complex about {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} in size, in which a multitude of geological forms shaped by water over the course of thousands of years can be found. These forms in conjunction with other prehistoric remains make the cave one of the most visited of the region. Remains of a small reservoir and rock art, both from the [[Paleolithic]] have been found here.

===Chufín===
The [[Cave of Chufín]] is located in the village of [[Riclones]]. It is located at the confluence point of several rivers and Nansa Lamasón in an environment with steep slopes amongst other caves with rock art. Chufín contains different levels of occupation, the oldest being around 20,000 years old. Even though the cave is small and of profound simplicity it subtle red paintings of deer, goats and cattle which are represented very schematically and a large number of symbols. One group, called "sticks", accompanies the animal paintings inside the cave. There are also a large number of pointillist drawings, including some around each hole in the rock which have been interpreted as a representation of a [[vulva]]. The cave has been declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by UNESCO in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prehistour.eu/carp-guide/chufin-cave Chufín Cave] CARP - Prehistoric Rock Art Trails, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Estación===
The Cave of La Estación is located near the cave of La Clotilde, in Santa Isabel de Quijas. It is notable for paintings in a large room representing horses and other signs which are not identifiable, dating from about the [[Aurignacian]] or [[Gravettian]] cultural periods.

===La Fuente del Salín===
Fuente del Salín Cave is located in the municipality of [[Val de San Vicente]], and contains an archaeological site discovered in 1985. The path is accessible only in times of drought, because it lies along an underground river. The remains are a reservoir belonging mainly to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], dated to 22,340 years ago by [[Carbon-14]] dating, and also a hearth; rock art and several negative handprint paintings are visible in this room, in addition to positive handprint paintings in other rooms.

===La Garma===
The [[La Garma cave complex|Cave of La Garma]] is located north of the village of Omoño, in the municipality of [[Ribamontán al Monte]]. It was found to wall paintings and fossils in a Lower Gallery, one of the best preserved Magdaleinian period floors. It is part of the [[Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain]] World Heritage Site.

===Hornos de la Peña===
The Cave of Hornos de la Peña Cave was discovered in 1903 and is situated on a hill near the village of Tarriba, [[San Felices de Buelna]]. The most notable paintings are a headless bison, horse and others at various levels in the first room; the second set of 35 figures consists of animals such as horses, bison, aurochs, goats and others. The paintings were dated to the initial or middle [[Magdalenian]] period.

===El Linar===
The cave of El Linar is located in La Busta, a town in the municipality of [[Alfoz de Lloredo]]. The path is an arroyo of more than {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} with three mouths which join the stream of Busta. [[Paleolithic]] materials have been detected and also remnants of [[Magdalenian]] era occupations. In one of the galleries is a group of animalistic motifs recorded as goats, bison and [[ibex]]. There is also another group of paintings of lines and vulvas and remains of the Bronze Age.

===Los Marranos===
The Cave of Los Marranos is located in Venta de Fresnedo, in the municipality of [[Lamasón]]; to access the cave, one follows a path that leads to two spring mouths. Geologically, it acts as a drain in times of flooding. It has a spacious entry with rock art. Remains of [[Paleolithic]] art are represented mainly by carvings in quartzite. a bronze buckle from the late [[Middle Ages]] indicates the possibility that the cave could have served as a shelter for travelers. In 2000, it was declared [[Bien de Interés Cultural]] by the Spanish Ministry of Law.

===La Meaza===
The [[cave of La Meaza]] is located in the municipality of [[Comillas]]. On the road to the district of La Molina there is a path leading to the cavity. Findings include the  remains of [[Solutrean]], [[Azilian]] and even some so-called [[Asturian culture|Asturien]] evidence, recent [[prehistoric]] burials and remains of the [[Middle Ages]]. The fact that occupancy has many times explained by the shape of the cave, with a wide entrance and a comfortable lobby to your room. At the bottom of the cavity some remains of Paleolithic rock art framed in the style III of Leroi-Gourhan were found, although they have not been kept too well.

===Micolón===
The Cave of Micolón is an archaeological site on the verge of the Palombera reservoir. It is a cavity of {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} length with a particularly narrow labyrinthine structure, in which some [[flint]] carvings have been found, such as nodules with signs of having been worked on and a chisel. The remains belong to the [[Solutrean]] occupation period, between 20,000 and 17,000 years old. There are several examples of rock art, including 22 rock carvings and several red paintings, basically framed in a room near the entrance. There are deer, horses and tectiform inscriptions, all style III of [[André Leroi-Gourhan]].

===Monte Castillo===
The [[Caves del Monte Castillo]] include the [[Cave of El Castillo]], the Cave of Las Chimeneas, the Cave of Las Monedas and the [[Cave of La Pasiega]].

===La Pasiega===
The [[Cave of La Pasiega]] located in Puente Viesgo is included in the UNESCO schedule of Human Heritage since July 2008, under the citation "Cave of Altamira".

===Porquerizo===
The [[Cave del Porquerizo]] is in the town of [[Celis, Spain|Celis]], in the municipality of Rionansa. It is reached by a path leading up from the center of town, which then traverses down a steep slope. There are remnants of the cave's occupation from the [[Solutrean]] era, as well as [[Paleolithic]] cave paintings, dating between 20,000 and 17,000 years old. There are some rock paintings, in a red pinpoint style, and some indistinct carvings. Its context and its morphology have been classified as a style of Leroi-Gourhan III.

===El Portillo===
The cave of El Portillo del Arenal is located in the village of Velo, in the municipality of Piélagos. It contains well-preserved [[rock art]], in addition to pottery fragments and funerary urns.

===Sovilla===
The Cave of Sovilla is located in the neighborhood of the same name in [[San Felices de Buelna]] and near the cave of Hornos de la Peña. It is characterized mainly by wall paintings that show deer, horses, bison and reindeer from the [[Magdalenian]] period.

===La Chora===
The La Chora Cave is located in San Pantaleon de Aras and includes a number of [[chert]] items as well as flint blades and scraper backs and Magdalenian bone harpoons.

===Morín===
Morín Cave or "Cave of the King" is in [[Villaescusa, Cantabria|Villaescusa]]. Archaeologists have found many items of interest in this site, such as the famous body cast of the so-called "Man of Morín" dating from the Middle Paleolithic. Thanks to the artifacts found in this cave, archaeologists have been able to study the habits of earlier [[hominids]].

===Ruso===

Cave of Ruso was discovered in Igollo, [[Camargo, Cantabria|Camargo]] and provided materials from the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] which were, as is traditional, moved to the Museum of Prehistory of Santander. There were several ceramic items in the classic [[beaker culture]] bell shape and the point of a retouched planar object. The Cave of Juyo has a long sequence of Magdalenian artifacts, though no rock art.

===El Soplao===
The [[Cave of El Soplao]] is located in the municipalities of Rionansa, Valdáliga and Herrerías. It is admired worldwide for the quality and quantity of geological formations or [[speleothems]] contained in its 17 miles in length, although only 6 are open to the public. There are rare formations as helictites (eccentric stalactites defying gravity) and "draperies" (sheets or translucent banners hanging from the ceiling). Its formation dates back to the Mesozoic, in particular the [[Cretaceous]] period 240 million years ago.

=== Torca del Carlista ===
[[Torca del Carlista]] is located in [[Cantabria]], and contains the fifth-largest underground chamber in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=9AQGdP3KegYC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22torca+del+carlista%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6wM39qLLSAhUK42MKHQX2BE8Q6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22torca%20del%20carlista%22&amp;f=false|title=Caves for the Uninitiated|last=Daly|first=Brian D.

===Del Valle===
[[File:Baston cueva del Valle.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Cane of Cave del Valle.]]
The [[Cave del Valle(Cantabria)|Cave del Valle]] is located in the municipality of [[Rasines]] and also known by locals as "La Viejarrona." It has a majestic entry from which the Silent River springs, a tributary of Ruahermosa, both of [[Assos]]. It is an important site, both prehistorically as well as speleologically; it dates to about the [[Azilian]] and Upper [[Magdalenian]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4190">The '''Central Eurasian Studies Society''' ('''CESS''') is a North American-based society for scholars concerned with the [[Central Eurasia]]n region. The society seeks to "promote high standards of research and teaching, and to foster communication among scholars through meetings and social networking", and to "facilitate interaction among senior, established scholars, junior scholars, graduate students, and independent scholars in North America and throughout the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cess.muohio.edu/CESSpg_org_info.html Statement of Purpose] CESS Website&lt;/ref&gt; Created in 2000, the society holds annual conferences and presents awards for recent publications.

==History==
Initial discussion about the creation of a society for [[Central Asian studies]] in North America began in the late 1990s during workshops at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Eventually consensus was reached for the establishment of the Central Eurasian Studies Society, and the first annual conference was held in October 2000. In April 2001, CESS was incorporated as a non-profit corporation in Massachusetts. The organization grew rapidly, and by 2003 had over 1,500 members from 70 countries.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.cess.muohio.edu/CESSpg_history.html  History of CESS] CESS Website&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Central Eurasian Studies Review'', was the society's main publication first published in 2002, but is no longer published.  However, links to previous copies are archived on their website [https://web.archive.org/web/20130327101226/http://centraleurasia.org/publication/cesr-online/].

By 2003 the CESS Secretariat had been established at [[Harvard University|Harvard University's]] Program on Central Asia and the Caucasus. The secretariat would later becoming a rotating secretariat, moving to [[Miami University]] in 2007 and Indiana University in 2011 [http://centraleurasia.org/].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Activities==
CESS has held an annual conference since 2000, usually in October. The conferences are held at various universities throughout [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The 2012 conference was held at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://centraleurasia.org/conferences/past-and-future-conferences/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115121121/http://centraleurasia.org/conferences/past-and-future-conferences/ |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }} CESS Website&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's first international conference (called a "regional conference") was held in August 2008 in [[Choktal]], [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ways.org/en/events/2008/aug/04/central_eurasian_studies_society_regional_conference Central Eurasian Studies Society Regional Conference] The World Association of Young Scientists&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, CESS presents two awards every year - a Book Award and a Best Graduate Student Paper Award. Each winner receives $500, and the best graduate student paper will be published in the [[academic journal]] ''Central Asian Survey''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cess.muohio.edu/CESSpg_awards.html CESS Awards] CESS Website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The main publication of CESS is the ''Central Eurasian Studies Review'', published bi-annually in the spring and summer.&lt;ref name=CESR&gt;[http://www.cesr-cess.org/ Central Eurasian Studies Review]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in January 2002. The publication is divided into four sections: Perspectives, Research Reports (for on-going research only), Conferences and Lecture Series, and Educational Resources and Developments.&lt;ref name=CESR2&gt;[http://www.cesr-cess.org/CESR_contribution.html Information for Contributors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120175918/http://www.cesr-cess.org/CESR_contribution.html |date=November 20, 2008 }} Central Eurasian Studies Review&lt;/ref&gt; All current and past issues are available online.

This work of Lochana Dasa or Lochananda Dasa is influenced by the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''[[Kadacha]]'' of [[Murari Gupta]]. The complete text is divided into four sections: the ''Sutra Khanda'', the ''Adi Khanda'', the ''Madhya Khanda'' and the ''Shesh Khanda''. As this work was written for the purpose of singing only, it is not further sub-divided into chapters.&lt;ref name=s1&gt;Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007).

==Contents==

The ''Chaitanya Mangala'' comrpises about 11000 verses. The ''Sutra Khanda'' has around 1800 verses, the ''Adi Khanda'' has about 3300 verses, the ''Madhya Khanda'' consists nearly 4300 verses  and the ''Shesh Khanda'' comprises about 1600 verses. The ''Sutrakhanda'' is a prelude to the [[Krishna]]'s appearance as the [[Gauranga]] [[avatar]] in [[Nabadwip]], which describes the events which led to this incarnation. The ''Adi Khanda'' narrates the early life of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu up to his trip to [[Gaya, India|Gaya]]. The ''Madhya Khanda'' describes events in Mahaprabhu's later life up to his meeting with [[Sarvabahuma Bhattacharya]]. The ''Shesh Khanda'' narrates his pilgrimages to southern and northern India. Some manuscripts also consist a description of the last part of the Mahaprabhu's life till his disappearance.&lt;ref name=s1/&gt;

'''Cuarenta Casas''' is an archaeological site in the northern [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. Construction of the site is attributed to the [[Mogollon culture]].

Located in [[Vallecito, Chihuahua|Vallecito]] in the municipality of [[Casas Grandes]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Forty Houses is believed to be the southernmost site related to the period of Mogollon influence. The site consists of a series of [[cliff dwelling]]s built in natural caves in the cliffs of Huapoca Canyon. The best known is the ''Cueva de las Ventanas'' (Cave of the Windows). Early Spanish explorers named the site Cuarenta Casas (''forty houses'') based on their speculation of the total number of structures. The area consists of five main cave communities: Cueva del Puente, Cueva de la Serpiente, Nido del Aguila and Cueva Grande.

== The Zone ==
[[File:Oasisamerican cultures circa 1350 CE.png|thumb|350px|Map of major Oasisamerican cultures, circa 1350 CE]]
The zone is located 45 kilometers north of the [[Ciudad Madera, Chihuahua|Maderas]] Municipality, in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], [[Mexico]], and some 250 kilometers northwest of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua City]].
There are five Paquimé Culture archaeological sites in this area, accessible from the Madera municipality,&lt;ref name=Aventuras /&gt; are:

===Huápoca===
Located 36 kilometers west of Madera, by a dirt road. The Ancestral Pueblo caves consist of the Serpent and the Eagle Nest caves. They are considered the most impressive built on cliffs. Have complete structures.&lt;ref name= "Aventuras" &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title= Cave Dwellings of the Huapoca Canyon |url= http://www.great-adventures.com/destinations/mexico/huapoca.html |publisher= Adventures Great and Small|year= |accessdate= August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are wonderful views of the Huapoca Canyon.

====Cueva de la Serpiente====
It has 14 adobe houses, over 1,000 years old.&lt;ref name=Aventuras /&gt;

====Nido del águila====
It only has one house, built on the edge of a sheer cliff under a rocky overhang, provides a meaning to its name.&lt;ref name=Aventuras /&gt;

===Cueva Grande===
Located 66 kilometers west of Madera, on a dirt road. Cueva Grande hides within convoluted land and behind branches of trees. The mouth of the cave is obscured by a waterfall from the top of the cave to a stream.&lt;ref name=Aventuras /&gt;
There are two, double-story houses (800 years old) that are good examples of the native construction techniques. There is also a round grain storage area behind the structure.&lt;ref name=Aventuras /&gt;

=== La Ranchería ===
Cave complex, 50 kilometers south of Madera. Has an extended archaeological remain area at the base of the Sirupa canyon.&lt;ref name=Aventuras /&gt;

===Cueva del Puente===
45 kilometers north of Madera

=== Cueva de Las Ventanas ===
During the early 16th century, explorer [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] wrote, "And here by the side of the mountain, we forged our way inland more than 50 leagues and there found forty houses (cuarenta casas)."&lt;ref name=Aventuras /&gt;

== Site History ==
[[File:40Casas2.jpg|thumb|The rock wall of the canyon, the ''Cueva de las Ventanas'' [[cliff dwelling]] is located left of center above a debris-covered cone.]]
The current inhabitation of Chihuahua probably initiated throughout the Western Mountain Range (Sierra Madre Occidental), when native hunter-gatherer groups moved from the north looking for areas with abundant edible plants. One of those groups produced the first known evidences in the "Cueva de las Ventanas", when they still lacked the constructions we now see. As these settlers dominated agricultural techniques, gradually began occupying the margins of the rivers and originated the Paquimé culture, neighboring what today is known as Casas Grandes, Chihuahua.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last= Guevara Sánchez |first=   Arturo |year=  1986|title= Las cuarenta casas, Pagina Web INAH|trans-title=Las Cuarenta Casas, INAH Web Page |journal=  |url= http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za00501.html#|language=Spanish |accessdate= August 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuarentas Casas construction occurred during the height of [[Casas Grandes|Paquimé (Casas Grandes)]] (1205-1260 CE), a period corresponding to the late [[Mogollon culture]] period. Cuarentas Casas was a refuge site,&lt;ref name=cave&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first=   |date=  |title= CAVE DWELLINGS OF THE HUAPOCA CANYON, MEXICO|journal=  |url= http://www.great-adventures.com/destinations/mexico/huapoca.html
|accessdate= July 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to others at the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] and [[Bandelier National Monument|Bandelier]] sites. The buildings share the typical T-shaped doorways of their northern neighbors and are constructed from [[adobe]] and rock with pine logs beams.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

It is possible that Cuarenta Casas was a garrison that protected allied groups in the region, in addition to safekeeping commercial routes. It settlers farmed maize and pumpkin, their nourishment was supplemented with hunting of small species (rabbits) and harvesting of eatable wild plants like acorns, yucca seeds and maguey leaves. This was confirmed by remains found in archaeological excavations. The Paquimé regional center must have had frequent problems with hostile neighboring groups, which explains the presence of many surveillance points in extensive areas. Besieged by those groups or perhaps by internal problems, the settlement decayed, was abandoned and some of its inhabitants emigrated.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

Constructions date back to that period; at that time the zone was a meeting point for native traders of the Paquimé group communicating with the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Gulf of California]] coasts, and to other cultural centers to the north such as Mesa Verde in Colorado and Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. The routes to the Pacific followed the Piedras Verdes River to the south and connected with the rivers that flow to the Pacific by way of smaller arroyos and canyons. Among these is the Huapoca Canyon to the west of the town of Madera. The Huapoca Canyon is not among the deepest of the Sierra Tarahumara but it possesses the most archaeological interest.&lt;ref name=Aventuras /&gt;

The reasons why the settlement decayed, at 1340 CE are not known. At the Paquimé fall as social and cultural center, the commercial routes disappeared, the guardians left their posts and many settlements throughout the route were abandoned. Occasionally "Cueva de las Ventanas" was briefly occupied mainly with ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

As of 1520, the caves still were inhabited by native groups, hence it was possible to obtain information about their way of life, the natives named themselves "Jovas" or [[Cáhita]]s, and with that name they also referred to a group or larger family. This ethnic group is now considered extinct.

The latest occupation of Cuarenta Casas occurred during the Paquimé apogee (1205 to 1260 CE); this period corresponds to the late period of Paquimé culture.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==The Site==
[[File:40Casas5.jpg|thumb|Typical T-shaped doorway]]
[[File:40Casas3.jpg|thumb|The large building in the ''Cueva de las Ventanas'' with Room 5 in the background.]]

Of the cave complex, the only area partially restored is the "Cueva de las Ventanas". It is a small archaeological site constructed with strong walls of poured adobe, with small "T" doors, characterizing the region pre-Hispanic architecture. It is a two-story structure of which only the ground floor rooms can be visited, these are distributed such that space was maximized within the space available in the cave.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Cueva de las Ventanas==
Almost all rooms had stuccoed floors and furnaces.

===Room 1===
It is almost totally destroyed and was placed towards the cave slope.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Room 2===
On its higher section, a watchtower was constructed; it has a large number of small windows. It was equipped with a small drain channel and a urinal, the only ones found at the site. It is suspected it was used particularly during the crude winters of the region.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Room 3===
It is a large room, by its characteristics it must have been an area where most daily activities took place. Because of a sidewalk carved on the rock it is believed to have been used for certain ceremonies, as was done in the [[kiva]]s, by southwestern US natives, from prehispanic times. This site has relevant similarities with sites of that region.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The room is partially roofed with pine beams and displays remains of windows that would perhaps complement those of the watchtower. Vestiges of a normal size door was found, all others are a meter of high. In this enclosure and almost in all other, the remains of strong floors with well finished stucco can be seen.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Room 4===
It is almost totally destroyed, it lacks ceiling, and remaining walls indicate that its size was larger than others in the cave's back, with similar functions to those of Room 3.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Room 5===
Its layout is irregular and it was built over a large rock. From old photographs of the site, it is known that its interior had an oval-shaped barn, with a kind of woven grass cover. Its overall height was two meters, currently, it is totally destroyed and it is only possible to see remains of the walls in the floor; these were reinforced with dry woven grass and covered with mud. Other similar barns have been found in like sites of the "Sierra Madre Occidental".&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Room 6===
The remaining rooms were built at the end of the cave, embedded in the rocky wall and it is believed were housing units.

Number 6 is in the south side and still has its ceiling pine wood beams in good conditions. Being adjacent to rooms 3 and 7 it is very dark and cold.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Rooms 7 and 8===
Number 7 is similar to the previous one, does not have any distinguishing characteristics. Number 8 lacks a ceiling and has access to a small area that perhaps was used as an internal patio. Perhaps it was used to manufacture arrows, as a required complementary activity. Several stone tools were found, of the type used to carve and smooth the wooden materials used to make projectiles.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Rooms 9 and 10===
Both are deteriorated and 10 were probably propped up by the last inhabitants. Vestiges of small stoves were found as well as compacted earth steps that lead to the long enclosures that are to the front.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Room 11===
Basically it is similar to the previous, but for some reason native groups of similar cultures to the constructors, visited it and painted zoomorphic designs on its walls; these are streamlined figures that represent elongated birds, the beak is apparent. It is possible that these artists were the original inhabitants, which returned to celebrate some type of ritual that could not be made elsewhere.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Room 12===
An individual burial was found, perhaps a local leader, it was placed in the small space between the wall and the rock of the cave. It had a small maize offering, one ceramic pot and a leather bag with [[pinole]], used by pre-Hispanic people of Mexico. The burial also contained, semiprecious stones, possibly currency to ensure his entrance to the underworld. The man was shrouded in a mortuary bed roll ([[Petate]]) similar those depicted in some of the pre-Hispanic codices.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Rooms 13 and 14===
Number 13 is very deteriorated and perhaps had large dimensions.

Number 14 is smaller and isolated, was constructed at the rocky bottom and because of its small dimensions it could only be used to sleep, as well as to temporarily isolate people, as per inhabitants beliefs, and as was done with young girls at the time of their first menstruation. This custom was practiced by native groups of the area, even in current times.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

From this room it is possible to see the floors of the second floor rooms, although deteriorated, clay molded forms can be seen near the center of each floor; these are of rectangular shape and not too high, perhaps stoves used in the site.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Eiji Nonaka'''|野中 英次|Nonaka Eiji}} is a Japanese [[manga artist]] and humorist. Eiji writes and illustrates ''[[Shōnen manga|shōnen]]'' and ''[[Seinen manga|seinen]]'' [[manga]]. His work appears in several [[List of manga magazines|manga magazines]] published by [[Kodansha]].

His most popular [[Serial (literature)|serial]], ''[[Cromartie High School]]'', ran in ''Weekly Shōnen Magazine'' from 2001 to 2006. The serial won Eiji the 2002 [[Kodansha Manga Award]] in the shōnen category.&lt;ref name="KodanshaHahn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |author=Joel Hahn |title=Kodansha Manga Awards |work=Comic Book Awards Almanac |accessdate=2007-08-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816031310/http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/kodansha.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, it was a jury selection in the seventh annual [[Japan Media Arts Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://archive.j-mediaarts.jp/en/festival/2003/manga/works/07mj_SAKIGAKE_CROMARTIE_HIGH_SCHOOL/ |title=Jury Selections: Sakigake!

A live-action [[feature film]], called ''[[Cromartie High – The Movie]]'', followed in 2005. A spin-off sequel titled ''Cromartie Kōkō Shokuinshitsu'' ("Cromartie High School Staff Room") debuted on October 27th 2018 on Kodansha's Magazine Pocket app. Nonaka authored the manga while the art was drawn by Ino Ichiban.&lt;ref name="Sequel"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ressler |first1=Karen |title=Cromartie High School Manga Returns in 'Spinoff Sequel' Manga |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-10-05/cromartie-high-school-manga-returns-in-spinoff-sequel-manga/.137791 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |date=October 5, 2018 |accessdate=October 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kodansha republished the serial in 17 paperback volumes (''[[tankōbon]]''). From 2001 through 2006, they released two or three volumes per year as the story progressed. [[ADV Manga]] published English translations of the first 12 volumes in 2005–2007; the first four of these were nominated for a 2006 [[Eisner Award]] in the category "Best U.S. Edition of Foreign Material".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-04-05/2006-eisner-nominations |author=&lt;!-- No byline --&gt; |title=2006 Eisner Nominations |date=April 5, 2006 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Eiji usually illustrates his own work, his ''shōnen'' serial ''[[Double-J (manga)|Double-J]]'' (2009) is illustrated by {{Nihongo|Maru Asakura|亜桜まる}}. ''Double-J'' was adapted into an animated miniseries, which aired on [[Nippon TV]] in 2011.

'''El Cuajilote''' or Filobobos is an [[archeological site]] of the [[Totonac]] Culture,&lt;ref name=Totonaca&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |date= |title=Sitio Arqueológico de Filobobos |trans-title=Filobobos Archaeological Site |journal=Portal  Veracruz |location= |url=http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=56,3850410&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |language=Spanish |format= |accessdate=August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407045943/http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=56,3850410&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |archivedate=2012-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Tlapacoyan]] municipality, [[Veracruz]] state, México.&lt;ref name=INAH&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cortés Hernández |first=   Jaime |date=  |title= Zona Arqueológica de Filobobos, Página Web de INAH, |trans-title=Filobobos, archaeological site  |journal=  |location=  |url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za02507a.html |language=Spanish |accessdate= August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as in many other Mesoamerican sites, the original name is unknown and arbitrarily names are assigned, sometimes local names are used, in this case, the name “'''El  Cuajilote'''” derives from the “Chote” tree from the Totonac region, although the tree is scarce in the area nowadays. This site is part of the Filobobos zone, where vestiges of at least six archaeological sites are known. Currently only two have been explored; '''Vega de la Peña''' and '''El Cuajilote'''.&lt;ref name=Esto&gt;{{cite web|first=Veronica |last=Lira |title=El Cuajilote, impresionante centro ceremonial |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n240017.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121010202732/http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n240017.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 October 2012 |publisher=Organización Editorial Mexicana |location= |language=Spanish |trans-title=El Cuajilote, impressive ceremonial center |date=14 April 2007 |accessdate=August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cuajilote''', is also the name of a tree (Parmentiera aculeate), also known as huachilote or monkey cocoa, typical of low deciduous forest, exist in broad territories in the South and Centre Mexico.

According to [[INAH]] the Filobobos name derives from the local sharp profiles (“Filos”) of gorges and ravines, created by a geologic phenomenon from the Cenozoic era, and of “”bobos”, name of an almost extinct fish variety, very appreciated in the region.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;
 
The gorges and water falls, have allowed a natural preservation of the Filobobos Archeological Site.&lt;ref name= "  Portal" &gt;{{cite web |first=  |last=  |title= El Cuajilote    |url=  http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=313,4309407&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |publisher= Portal de Veracruz |location=  |language=  Spanish|trans-title=|year= |accessdate= October 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a very fertile region and from prehispanic time it has been an important natural communication corridor between the Central Plateau and the Gulf of Mexico, used by diverse ethnic groups for travels, in the process of commercial and cultural trade.

==Site history==
This site is located within the urban area of Tlapacoya, [[Alonso de Molina]],&lt;ref&gt;creator of the "vocabulary in Spanish and Mexican Languages", written between 1555 and 1571&lt;/ref&gt; establishes that Atzalan is a [[Nahuatl]] word meaning "place where washing is done ", i.e. laundry. Cecilio Agustín Robelo,&lt;ref&gt;Mexican writer and philologist (November 22, 1839 – January 16, 1916). An important part of his work was dedicated to the research of the Nahuatl language and its influence on Spanish language spoken in Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt; noted the word to be an impersonal verb “tlapa”, wash and yan, is the place where the verb’s action takes place, resulting in "place where wahsing or laundry takes place". Peñafiel interpreted the Tlapacoyan hieroglyph from the [[Matrícula de Tributos]] (Mendocino Codex) and adds establishes that the sign Teltl, means stone below water (atl) and above a fantastic figure which could be a white and black canvas with a hand over it, indicating a verbal word derived from Tlapaca "wash" ending with location prefix "Yan".&lt;ref name="  Gob"&gt;{{cite web|first= |last=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |title=ATZALAN, ESTADO DE VERACRUZ DE IGNACIO DE LA LLAVE |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/veracruz/municipios/30183a.htm |publisher= |location= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Tlapacoyan, Veracruz Municipality |year= |accessdate=October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616191951/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/veracruz/municipios/30183a.htm |archivedate=2011-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atzalan is of Totonac origin, there was a large city here, known today as “Vega de la Peña”. In the 16th century here was an old town called Yohualtlacualoyan, ancient center of Tenochtitlan tributary cities, including the cities of: Xilochitlán Xochicuauhtlan, Tuchtlán Coapan, Aztapan and Acazacatlán&lt;ref name=Gob/&gt;

Historical records establish that this area was a tax collection center (products) for the empire in this zone, it collected several products, including bird feathers Empire.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;General XVI Century information, registered in the Mendocino Codex (“Matrícula de Tributos").&lt;/ref&gt;

El Cuajilote flourished towards 200 CE, and had a constant occupation until 800 CE. Some constructions seem to have been altars, as vestiges indicate aspects of fertility and earth cult.&lt;ref name= Esto  /&gt;

Permanence of inhabitants in the Filobobos archaeological zone was made possible by the availability of survival resources, the permanent supply of water and its constant exploration, complemented with the bordering archaeological niches in high and low lands around the gorges. The ball games are different in both sites and have opposite alignment.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

==Site ==
Urban development is seen in the arrangement of the archaeological sites, which becomes evident by the urban planning adapted to the physiographic and natural terrain; for example hydraulic infrastructure is evident in the water wells, channels and [[Temazcal]]es.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

The great Totonaca Plaza, sheltered by cliffs, canyons and ravines is crossed by the Filobobos River, it is located in a very humid zone estimated at a little more than 2000 years old.

The site has an extension of about 31,500 square meters.&lt;ref name=Esto /&gt; It is estimated that there are 10.5 hectares of unexplored structures.&lt;ref name= Mario &gt;{{cite web |first=  Mario |last=  Noriega Villanueva |title=  TLAPACOYAN POSEEDOR DE UNA INMENSA RIQUEZA TURÍSTICA |url= http://www.informatepr.com/cuajilote.html |publisher= informatepr.com |location=  |language=  Spanish|trans-title=ATZALAN HOLDER OF AN IMMENSE TOURIST WEALTH |year= |accessdate= October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main plaza has a phallic sculpture representing fertility. 
 
[[Phallus|Phallic]] figurines were found, of the type known as “San Jose de Acateno”, representing a dual personage, fertility and rebirth worship, manifested by cycles of constant life renovation, which culminates with the triumph of the sun over darkness of the underworld.&lt;ref name= Esto  /&gt;

In this area, there are several archaeological sites not yet explored, including “Piedra Blanca” on the left bank of the river; “Vega de la Peña”, an ancient town, 3&amp;nbsp;km below; "La Colorada" on the road to Martínez de la Torre, and "El Relicario". This site was opened to the public in 1994.&lt;ref name=Mario  /&gt;

==Structures==
It is estimated that there are over 500 structures, with height ranging from 6 and 80 metros.&lt;ref name=Mario  /&gt;

The Main plaza has 10 important side buildings and the main temple, there are other smaller plazas.&lt;ref name=Esto /&gt;

The site is laid out and aligned with three axes south-north, separated by well laid mounds that confine plazas of approximately 400 meters long by 80 meters wide with central altars. The main plaza is bordered on the north side by a ball game court.&lt;ref name=INAH /&gt;

===Ball game===
As part of the main plaza is the [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballgame court]], which enclose the central plaza to the north, the wall have stucco plaster remains. A feline sculpture with a spike for embedding and offering pots, possibly representing [[Tezcatlipoca]].&lt;ref name=Esto /&gt;

The ballgame court, built on the river bank, is aligned northwest-southeast, adapted to the physiographical conditions imposed by the Bobos River, whose flow is towards the west.

The place have five building complexes, that for INAH reasons have been named in agreement with the cardinal position in which they are located; e.g., west, center, south and southeastern complex.

The ballgame courts evidences a large El Tajín style influence and conserves stucco plaster remains on its walls.

=== Tlaltecuhtli altar ===
This altar was named “[[Tlaltecuhtli]]”, represents a frog, carved from a single stone piece, displays on the sides a possible “Chalchihuitlxóchitl” or “divine flower”, as well as a mutilated face.&lt;ref name=Esto /&gt;

===Temazcal===
In front of the previous altar, an enormous circular Temazcal was excavated.

===Geoglyphs===
About a kilometer to the north, what are believed to be astronomical markers known as “Teos” or [[Geoglyph]]s were found, protruding about a meter from the ground, made from volcanic rock, with engraved figures and spirals indicating the site distribution, believed to have been markers for pilgrims.&lt;ref name=Esto/&gt;

===Water spring temple ===
The "Templo del Manatial", is located at the top, shows remains of a double room. In the corner a water spring is located, it appears to have been used for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name=Esto /&gt;

==Vega de la Peña==
Another close by site is “Vega de la Peña”, about 4&amp;nbsp;km north of El Cuajilote. This place was inhabited between 900 and 1500 AD, when their inhabitants constructed the “Fretwork Temple”, thus called because its facade exhibits a decorative strip that alludes to [[Xicalcoliuhqui]] or fire serpent.&lt;ref name=Portal /&gt;

The '''Fontana History of European War and Society''' is a five-volume history of war and society in Europe from 1450 to 1970.

==Critical opinion==
Ian Beckett described the series as a synthesis made possible by a flourishing of new, more specialised, studies, which had begun to appear after the Second World War, but took the view that [[Victor Kiernan]]'s Marxist treatment of empire had not dated well.&lt;ref name="Beck"/&gt; [[John Rigby Hale]]'s volume, on the other hand, was described as a "model of historical writing" by Beckett,&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite book|author=Beckett, Ian F.W.|title=A Guide to British Military History: The Subject and the Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DILbCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|year=2016|publisher=Pen and Sword|location=Barnsley|isbn=978-1-4738-5667-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a post-war movement to rescue the history of warfare from the memoirs of generals and from museum experts writing about armour and weapons.&lt;ref name="Acad"&gt;"John Rigby Hale, 1923–1999" by Michael Mallett in {{cite book|author=British Academy|title=2000 Lectures and Memoirs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZ7p__t5l_QC&amp;pg=PA548|series=Proceedings of the British Academy 111|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-726259-7|page=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Henry Yule''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCSI}} (1 May 1820 – 30 December 1889) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[oriental studies|Orientalist]]. He published many travel books, including translations of the work of [[Marco Polo]] and ''Mirabilia'' by the 14th century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friar [[Jordanus]]. He was also the compiler of a dictionary of [[Anglo-Indian]] terms, the ''[[Hobson-Jobson]]'', along with [[Arthur Coke Burnell]].

==Early life==
Henry Yule was born at [[Inveresk]] near [[Edinburgh]] in Scotland on 1 May 1820. He was the youngest son of Major William Yule (1764–1839) and his wife Elizabeth Paterson (died circa 1827). William Yule had served as an officer in [[Bengal Army|the Bengal army]] of the [[East India Company]] and had retired in 1806. He was interested in Arabic and [[Persian literature]] and collected early manuscripts. These were later donated by his sons to the British Museum.{{sfn|Yule|1903}}&lt;!--this cite covers the whole paragraph --&gt;  He translated the ''Apothegms of Ali the son of Abu Talib'' (referring to [[Ali]], the successor to [[Mohammed]], the prophet of [[Islam]]; the obscure English word "[[wikt:en:apothegm|apothegm]]" refers to short pithy sayings, see ''[[hadith]]''.)

Yule's mother died before he was eight and William moved to Edinburgh with his sons. Yule attended the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh|Royal High School]] and then in 1833 was sent to be coached by the Reverend [[Henry Hamilton (priest)|Henry Hamilton]] at his rectory in the village of [[Wath, Harrogate|Wath]] near [[Ripon]] in [[North Yorkshire]].  When Hamilton moved to Cambridge in the following year Yule was transferred to the care of the Reverend [[James Challis]], at [[Papworth Everard]] near Cambridge. The other resident pupils were [[John Mason Neale|John Neale]] and [[Harvey Goodwin]]. (Neale co-founded the [[Society of Saint Margaret]], an order of women in the [[Church of England]] dedicated to nursing the sick, while Goodwin became [[Bishop of Carlisle]].) Yule's stay at  Papworth Everard ended in 1826 when Challis was appointed [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy|Plumian Professor of Astronomy]] and moved to the [[Cambridge Observatory|Observatory]] in Cambridge.{{sfn|Yule|1903}}&lt;!--this cite covers the whole paragraph --&gt;

After a brief period at [[University College London]], Yule entered the [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Military College]] at [[Addiscombe]] near [[Croydon]] (1837–8),{{sfn|Vibart|1894|p=[https://archive.org/stream/addiscombeitsher00viba#page/680/mode/1up 680]}} followed by the [[Royal School of Military Engineering|Royal Engineers Establishment at Chatham, Kent]]. He obtained his [[Commission (document)|commission]] in December 1838,{{sfn|Vibart|1894|p=[https://archive.org/stream/addiscombeitsher00viba#page/487/mode/1up 487]}} and joined the [[Bengal Engineers]] in 1840.{{sfn|Driver|2004}}{{sfn|Yule|1903}}

Both of Henry's brothers worked in India. The eldest, George Udny Yule (1813–1886), worked in the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Bengal civil service]]. The other brother, Robert (1817–1857), died near Delhi during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]].{{sfn|Yule|1903}} The statistician [[Udny Yule]] was the son of George and thus the nephew of Henry.

==India==
[[File:AdenHenryYule.jpg|thumb|''The main pass, Aden'' by Yule, drawn in January 1844 during his return journey to India.]]
Yule arrived in [[Calcutta]] at the end of 1840. His first posting was in the [[Khasi Hills]], a remote area to the northeast of [[Bengal]] in the modern state of [[Meghalaya]]. His mission was to establish a practical method of transporting coal to the plains. In this he was unsuccessful but he became fascinated by the region and wrote an account of its people,{{sfn|Yule|1844}} including the first written description of their [[living root bridges]]. In 1842 he was transferred to a team of engineers led by Captain (later General) [[William Erskine Baker|William Baker]] charged with the construction of irrigation canals. Their headquarters were at [[Karnal]], {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north of [[Delhi]].

He returned to England in 1843 and [[cousin marriage|married his cousin]] Anna Maria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=1843 | title=The United Service Magazine | page=319 | volume=Part 3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wv4StFOzfYsC&amp;pg=PA319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (d. 1875), daughter of Major-General Martin White of the Bengal Infantry (d. 1856).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=1856 | title=The United Service Magazine | page=172 | volume=Part 3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9sRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1843 she accompanied him back to India but returned owing to ill health. He was appointed to a committee charged with investigating the relationship between irrigation by the proposed [[Ganges Canal]] and its impact on [[public health]] in the area.{{sfn|Baker|Dempster|Yule|1868}}{{sfn|Yule|1903|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/bookofsermarcopo001polo#page/n46/mode/1up xxxvii-xxxviii]}} He served in both the [[Sikh wars]] (1845-6 and 1848-9). In 1849 he took three years of extended leave and returned to live in Edinburgh with his wife. He lectured at the [[Scottish Naval and Military Academy]] and wrote a volume on fortifications (1851).{{sfn|Driver|2004}}. 

A daughter, Amy, was born in 1852 and shortly after her birth, Yule returned to Bengal. He worked in [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] and [[Burma]] and was put in charge of a new railway system. This was interrupted by a posting as a secretary to Colonel [[Arthur Phayre]]'s mission to [[Inwa|Ava]], Burma, in 1855. In 1858 he published his account of this journey, ''Narrative of the Mission to the Court of Ava'' with  illustrations.{{sfn|Yule|1858}} The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 rebellion]] made his life difficult, and although Yule was close to the governor generals [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] and [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]], he lost interest in his work.{{sfn|Driver|2004}}

==Retirement in Europe==
Yule retired in 1862, and Canning's death in that year made it difficult for him to find any official appointment in London. In 1863 he was created a [[Companion of The Most Honourable Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] through the influence of [[Roderick Murchison|Sir Roderick Murchison]]. He devoted his leisure to the [[medieval]] history and geography of [[Central Asia]]. His wife became unwell, and they crossed Europe to settle in [[Palermo|Palermo, Sicily]]. He made use of the richly stocked public libraries there during this period. He published ''Cathay and the Way Thither'' (1866), and the ''Book of [[Marco Polo]]'' (1871), for which he received the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|title=Medals and Awards: Gold Medal recipients |publisher=Royal Geographical Society |url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221002/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his wife's death in 1875, Yule returned to England where he was appointed to the [[Council of India]]. Yule remarried in 1877, his new wife Mary Wilhelmina (died 26 April 1881) the daughter of a Bengal civil servant, [[Skipwith baronets|Fulwar Skipwith]].{{sfn|Driver|2004}}

Yule was a member, and from 1877 to 1889 President, of the [[Hakluyt Society]]. He was also vice-president of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (1887–9), and would have become a president but for a protest that he led along with [[Henry Hyndman]] against [[Henry Morton Stanley]]. The Society wanted to welcome Stanley but Yule stood against the violent methods used in Africa. One of his heroes, on the other hand, was [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teltscher|first1=Kate|title=Introduction to new edition of Hobson-Jobson|date=2013|publisher=OUP|isbn=0191645842|page=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Hakluyt Society, Yule edited the ''Mirabilia Descripta'' (1863), a translation of the travels of the 14th century Friar [[Jordanus]],{{sfn|Yule|1863}} and ''The Diary of [[William Hedges (colonial administrator)|William Hedges]]'' (3 vols, 1887–89). The latter contains a biography of [[Thomas Pitt|Governor Pitt]], grandfather of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]]. He contributed introductions to [[Nikolay Przhevalsky]]'s ''Mongolia'' (1876) and [[William Gill (explorer)|Captain William Gill]]'s ''The River of Golden Sand'' (1880). He wrote biographical notes for the Royal Engineers' ''Journal'', and many geographical entries in the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.

Yule's most popular work, compiled with [[Arthur C. Burnell]], was the ''[[Hobson-Jobson]]'' (1886), a historical dictionary of [[Anglo-Indian]] words and phrases which continues to provide an insight into the language used in [[British India]].

Yule died at his home in [[Earls Court]], London, on 30 December 1889 aged 69, and is buried at [[Tunbridge Wells]].{{sfn|Driver|2004}}

==Awards==
Yule was awarded an honorary doctorate ([[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]]) from [[Edinburgh University]] in 1884 and served as royal commissioner for the [[Colonial and Indian Exhibition]] of 1886. He was created [[Order of the Star of India|Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India]] in 1889.{{sfn|Yule|1903}}

'''''Ill Met by Moonlight: The Abduction of General Kreipe'''''  is a non-fiction partly-autobiographical book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Moss, W. Stanley.

Stanley Moss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Davis, Wes. ''The Ariadne Objective'', 2014, Random House|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/the-ariadne-objective/9780593072806}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[British people|British]] soldier, writer and traveller. It describes an operation in Crete during the Second World War to capture German general [[Heinrich Kreipe]]. Moss kept a diary during the war years and based his book on it. The 2014 edition includes an introduction by one of Moss's children and an afterword by [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]].

The story was made into a [[Ill Met by Moonlight (film)|1957 film with the same title]] starring [[Dirk Bogarde]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] writer-director-producer team of [[Powell and Pressburger|Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger]].

==Development and publication==
Moss recounted his and [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]]’s activities during the [[Second World War]] as agents in [[Crete]] of the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), notably their extraordinary [[Kidnap of General Kreipe|kidnapping of Heinrich Kreipe]], Commander of the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Infantry Division]] that was occupying Crete, and his removal to [[Cairo]] (and British war forces) in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Secret War Exhibition, Imperial War Museum, London,|url= http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was written in early 1945 but was censored by the Head of SOE, [[Colin Gubbins|Major-General Sir Colin Gubbins]] (CD), by instruction to [[Colin Hercules Mackenzie|Colin Mackenzie]] (BB100), Head of [[Force 136]]. When the book was finally published in 1950, it was selected by [[W. Somerset Maugham]] as one of the best three books of that year writing,"more thrilling than any detective story I can remember, and written in a modest and most engaging manner".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times '', 24 December 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''London Mystery Magazine #10 '', June - July 1951, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The book was chosen to lead the BBC's famous radio series ''Now it can be told'' of 1950. It has been republished many times since and remains in print.

The title is a [[List of titles of works based on Shakespearean phrases|quotation]] from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 60).

The book has been translated into Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Mal encuentro a la luz de la luna'', 2014, Acantilado, Translator: Dolores Payás |url=http://www.acantilado.es/catalogo/mal-encuentro-a-la-luz-de-la-luna/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Brutti Incontri al Chiaro di Luna", 2018, Adelphi, Translator: Gianni Pannofino, |url=https://www.adelphi.it/libro/9788845932472}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='' Κακό φεγγαραντάμωμα: Το χρονικό της απαγωγής του Στρατηγού Κράιπε'', 2015, Metaichmio, Translator: Μυρσίνη Γκανά |url=https://www.metaixmio.gr/el/products/%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%8C-%CF%86%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%B3%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%AC%CE%BC%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aftermath of ''Ill Met by Moonlight'' is described in Moss's second book, ''[[A War of Shadows]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Moss, W. Stanley. ''A War of Shadows'', 2014, Bene Factum Publishing|url= http://bene-factum.co.uk/?s=a+war+of+shadows}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering his return to Crete and his subsequent operations in Greece and the Far East.

==Summary==
{{main|Kidnap of Heinrich Kreipe}}

In May 1941, German forces attacked and occupied Crete. Allied forces were driven back and evacuated to North Africa by June. The [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) inserted agents on Crete in order to work with the local [[Cretan resistance|resistance]] in harrying German occupying forces.

On 4 February 1944, Major [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]] and Captain [[William Stanley Moss]] and two Cretan SOE agents left Egypt by plane for Crete. Their intention was to parachute into Crete but after arriving at the [[drop zone]], only Leigh Fermor was able to parachute successfully. The others had to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and were returned to Egypt. On landing Leigh Fermor was met by a group from the [[Cretan resistance]], with whom he remained until the arrival of the rest of the SOE team. After three more attempts at a parachute jump over a two-month period, Moss and the other two arrived by Motor Launch ML 842 on 4 April 1944. They were met on the beach by Leigh Fermor and another SOE agent, Sandy Rendel.

Their target General Müller was replaced by General Kreipe just before they arrived.  The team decided to proceed with the plan to abduct the German commanding officer.  The SOE team included a number of Cretans; 'Anthony' (Antonis Papaleonidas), 'Micky' (Michalis Akoumianakis) and Grigorios Chnarakis. Micky was especially welcome as his house was opposite Kreipe's residence, the [[Villa Ariadne]], in the village of [[Knossos]]. The team reconnoitred the area and planned the abduction. Dressed as a Cretan shepherd, Leigh Fermor travelled on the local bus to check Knossos and the area around the German headquarters. He decided that the German headquarters would be too difficult to penetrate. After a few days of alternately observing the actions of the General, they finalized the details of the abduction. The plan was for the two British officers, dressed as [[corporal]]s in the  ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]'' (German military police), to stop the general's car on his way home at what was supposed to be a routine check point.

On the night of 26 April 1944, the two British officers stopped the General's car before the Villa Ariadne. When the car stopped, Leigh Fermor took care of Kreipe and Moss knocked the driver out with his cosh.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre, Ben, ''The Times'', 11 June 2011, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moss's cosh held by Imperial War Museum London, Catalogue ref WEA 4182&lt;/ref&gt; Moss drove the team and the General in the General's car for an hour and a half through 22 controlled road blocks in [[Heraklion]] before leaving Leigh Fermor to abandon the car. When Leigh Fermor left the car, he also left documents revealing that the kidnapping had been done by [[British Commandos]] so that no reprisals should be taken against the local population.

With his Cretan escorts, Moss set off with the General across country to a rendezvous where they would be joined by Leigh Fermor. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British motor launch (ML 842 commanded by Brian Coleman) was to pick them up. On 14 May 1944, the SOE team and the general were finally picked up from a beach near [[Rodakino]], possibly Peristeres beach, on the southern side of the island. They were transported to safety, landing at [[Mersa Matruh]] in Egypt.

After the war, a member of Kreipe’s staff reported how, on hearing the news of the kidnapping, an uneasy silence in the officers' mess in Heraklion was followed by, “Well gentlemen, I think this calls for champagne all round.”&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, Artemis, ''Cairo in the War 1939–1945'', Hamish Hamilton, 1989, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Post War correspondence explains that Kreipe was disliked by his soldiers because, amongst other things, he objected to the stopping of his own vehicle for checking in compliance with his commands concerning approved travel orders. This tension between the General and his troops, in part, explains the caution of sentries in considering stopping the General’s car as Moss drove it through Heraklion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Beutin, Dr Ludwig, Letter to W. Stanley Moss, 27 September 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was due to be published in Germany in 1950. Kreipe alleged that he had never given his parole not to shout or to try to   escape to Moss and Leigh Fermor as described by Moss in the book. Kreipe secured an injunction preventing publication of the book in Germany on the grounds that the statement in the book was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Oliver, ''Ill Met by Moonlight:The Post-War Cultural Narrative of the Abduction of General Kreipe in Crete, 1944'', 2018, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Leigh Fermor's report after the operation&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Fermor, Patrick, ''Short Report on Capture of General Kreipe", TNA File HS5/418
1944, p3.&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of his account of the abduction published in 2015 both corroborated Moss's version of events.

[[Image:Independence-fjord.svg|thumb|250px|right|Areas of Independence I and Independence II cultures around Independence Fjord]]
'''Independence I''' was a culture of [[Paleo-Eskimo]]s who lived in northern [[Greenland]] and the Canadian Arctic between 2400 and 1000 BC. 

It is named after [[Independence Fjord]]. They lived at the same time as the [[Saqqaq culture]] of southern Greenland. The [[Independence II culture]] had a similar geographical extent from the 8th century BC, roughly 600 years after the disappearance of Independence I. The Independence I occupation of northern Greenland appears to have been much more intensive than that Independence II.

Radiocarbon dates and typologies of dwellings and tools do not allow distinguishing any chronological changes in the Independence I culture over its long existence (Grønnow 2016:728).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of the Prehistoric Arctic|title=Independence I and Saqqaq: The First Greenlanders|author=Bjarne Grønnow|DOI=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199766956.013.33|editor1=Max Friesen|editor2=Owen Mason|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independence I culture disappeared around 1000 BC for unknown reasons. Scientists have considerably debated the reasons for which Independence I and II emerged in the isolated northeastearn part of Greenland, as well as how these cultures flourished and disappeared. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Greenlandic Dorset|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of the Prehistoric Arctic|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199766956.013.56|author1=J.F. Jensen|editor=M. Friesen and O. Mason|year=2016|quote=However, with just 12 Greenlandic Dorset [Independence II in this context] sites known from northernmost Greenland (Grønnow and Jensen 2003), the density of the Greenlandic Dorset occupation in this region does not compare to that of the older Independence I occupation of the same area.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|737}}

Danish explorer [[Eigil Knuth]] first recognised the existence of both Independence I and II.&lt;ref name="ucalgary"&gt;{{cite journal|title=EIGIL GREVE KNUTH 1903 – 1996|last=Laursen|first=Dan |date=December 1996 |journal=Arctic |publisher=ucalgary.ca |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=401–403 |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic49-4-401.pdf |doi=10.14430/arctic1216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fantastic universe 195403.jpg|thumb|right|Brown's novella "The Love Machine" was cover-featured on the March 1954 issue of ''[[Fantastic Universe]]'']]
'''Dr. James Cooke Brown''' (July 21, 1921 – February 13, 2000) was an American [[sociologist]] and [[science fiction author]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/homeville/fmi/s448.htm#A12314 The Emissary, (nv) Astounding Jul 1952] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108170309/http://www.philsp.com/homeville/fmi/s448.htm |date=2011-11-08 }}, Astounding Science Fiction (UK) Dec 1952, BROWN, JIM (chron.)&lt;/ref&gt; He is notable for creating the artificial language [[Loglan]] and for designing the [[Parker Brothers]] board game ''[[Careers (board game)|Careers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readymade.com/magazine/article/designing_his_own_careers Designing His Own ‘Careers’]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, How Life Imitates a Board Game, by Rachel Hutton, Issue 3: The Outdoors Issue, Summer 2002, ReadyMade&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown's novel ''The Troika Incident'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1970)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lfONQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Troika+incident:+a+tetralogue+in+two+parts&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0by9TpDuEKLqmAW40ciQBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA The Troika incident: a tetralogue in two parts], Author:James Cooke Brown, Publisher:Doubleday, 1970, Length:399 pages, ASIN: B0006C09JO&lt;/ref&gt; describes a worldwide free knowledge base similar to the Internet.  The novel begins with the belief that the world is on the eve of self-destruction, but then it presents a world about a century from now which is a paradise of peace and prosperity, all based on ideas, movements, and knowledge presently available in the world.  In its metafictional structure, the novel is a call for social change, not through revolution but through free education and the resilience of human ingenuity.  Long out of print and relatively rare, an e-book version (Amazon Kindle) of the novel was released in 2012.  The novel envisioned all books and periodicals being viewed on portable electronic devices called "readers" in the year 2070, when it is set.

Among his other achievements, Brown designed, and had built, a three-hulled sailboat, called a [[trimaran]].  He utilized this boat to sail to many parts of the world.

While on a South American cruise with his wife, Brown was admitted to a hospital in Argentina, where he died at the age of 78.&lt;ref name=jmbabout /&gt;

==Setting==

===Characters &amp; organizations===
{{details|Kerberos saga characters}}
As a military science fiction work the Kerberos Saga's main characters are members of rival military and police services, namely the [[List of Kerberos Saga characters#Metropolitan Security Police Organization "M.P."|Shutokei]] (a.k.a. the "Capital Police" in the English language adaptation), the [[List of Kerberos Saga characters#Self-Police|Self-Police]] ("Local Police" in the English adaptation) and the [[JSDF]]. However, these conflictual forces have a common foe, [[Sedition|Anti-government]] organizations and terrorists such as [[The Sect]] and its factions.

Secondary and [[guest appearance]] characters introduced by author Mamoru Oshii are taken from his previous works such as [[culinary art]] and [[rhetoric]] masters [[Tachiguishi]] ("Fast Food Grifters" in the English adaptation) or [[Kerberos saga characters#Cameo characters|Detective Matsui]] from the ''[[Patlabor]]'' franchise.

Members of the saga's core organisation, the Shutokei's [[List of Kerberos Saga characters#Special Armed Garrison "Kerberos"|Special Armed Garrison]], have an animal counterpart which is an [[allegory]] and sometimes a [[metonymy]]. This animal can be a [[mythological]] dog such as [[Cerberus]] (the garrison's [[emblem]]) and [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]] as in the comic book, or it can be a German [[dog breed]]s as in ''[[Kerberos Panzer Cop]]'' and its sequel ''[[Kerberos Saga: Rainy Dogs]]''; this comic book series original title means "Dog-Wolf Legend" (犬狼伝説, ''kenrou densetsu''). It can be a [[Honshū wolf|Japanese wolf]] (狼, ''Ookami'') as in ''Jin-Roh'' ("Man-Wolf" in English) and in ''Kerberos &amp; Tachiguishi'' which borrow drama parts to the ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' tale. Also it can be a stray dog as in the 1991 eponymous movie.

===Timeline===
The Kerberos Saga is based upon an [[alternate history]] with key events called "incidents" (事件, ''jiken''). Altered historical events turned into fiction include Japan siding with the Allies, the Germany-won [[battle of Stalingrad]], [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Stauffenberg]]'s then-successful [[20 July plot|assassination attempt on Hitler]], the [[occupation of Japan]] by Germany - instead of the United States - called "[[Weimar Republic|Weimar Establishment]]" (ワイマール体制, ''weimaru taisei''), and the prominent [[February 26 Incident|26 February ''coup d'état'']] (a.k.a. "Kerberos Uprising") attempted by the Special Armed Garrison instead of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].

===Main locations===
Although the saga's plot is mainly located in the Japanese capital (as the Special Armed Garrison jurisdiction is limited to the [[Tokyo]] area), some episodes happen in foreign cities including [[Taipei]] and [[Tainan City|Tainan]] (''[[StrayDog: Kerberos Panzer Cops]]''), [[Old Havana]] (''[[The Killers (2003 manga)|The Killers]]'') and [[Stalingrad]] (''Kerberos Panzer Jäger'').

Among the Tokyo landmarks appearing in the saga are [[Odaiba]] (''The Red Spectacles''), [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], the [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] (''Kerberos Panzer Cop'' Act4), [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department|Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department headquarters building]] (''Kerberos Panzer Cop'' Act8), the [[Prime Minister of Japan]]'s cabinet called [[Kantei]] (''Kerberos Panzer Cop'' Act8) and the [[University of Tokyo]]'s [[University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus|Yasuda Auditorium]] (''Kerberos Saga Rainy Dogs'' Act3).

A recurring location is [[sewerage|sewer]], it can be the Tokyo sewer as in ''Kerberos Panzer Cop'' (Act 1) and ''Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade'' or abroad sewer as in ''Kerberos Saga Rainy Dogs'' (Act 8). In all these works, sewer is the final stage holding the Special Armed Garrison (Kerberos) main character's last fight. In the Greek mythology, the ''Kerberos'' ([[Cerberus]]) watchdog guards the gates of the Underworld, called [[Hades]], to prevent those who have crossed the [[river Styx]] from ever escaping. Hence the sewer can be regarded as an [[allegory]] of the [[Underworld]]; the original title for the 1991 movie ''[[StrayDog]]'' is "kerberos: watchdog of ''jigoku''" (ケルベロス 地獄の番犬, ''keruberosu: jigoku no banken'') with ''[[Diyu|jigoku]]'' being the realm of the dead in the [[Japanese mythology]].

==Releases==

===Japanese releases===
The saga started in January 1987 with the Japanese broadcast of the [[radio drama]] series ''[[While Waiting for the Red Spectacles]]'' (紅い眼鏡を待ちつつ, ''Akai megane o machi tsutsu''), prior to the theatrical release of the live-action film ''[[The Red Spectacles]]'' (紅い眼鏡, ''Akai megane''). A manga series adaptation, ''[[Kerberos Panzer Cop]]'' (''Kenrou densetsu'') started the following year and was compiled as a single volume (Acts 1~4) in 1990.

The following year was released ''[[StrayDog: Kerberos Panzer Cops]]'' (ケルベロス 地獄の番犬, ''Keruberosu jigoku no banken''), the first theatrical adaptation of the manga.

In 1999, the manga series was completed (Acts 5~8) and re-released as two compilation volumes. Few months later was released ''[[Jin-Roh]]'' (人狼, ''Jinrou'') the anime adaptation of the first manga. It remains the franchise's most popular work outside Japan until today.

''[[Tachigui: The Amazing Lives of the Fast Food Grifters]]'' (立喰師外伝, ''Tachiguishi retsuden''), an animation feature spin-off was released in theaters and DVD in 2006.

===Asian releases===
''Kerclros Panzer Cop 犬狼伝説'', an unlicensed Chinese version of the 1990 manga volume was published in Taiwan in the early 1990s.

''犬狼傳說'', a Chinese version complete volume (Acts 1~8) was available in [[Malaysia]] in 2000. A licensed, two volumes, Chinese version of the Japanese 2000 re-edition ("Frozen Version") was issued in [[Hong Kong]] the same year. A similar edition was available in Korean language in South Korea the same year.

A traditional Chinese 2-volume licensed edition was published in Taiwan in 2002.

===North American releases===
A six issues English adaptation of the first manga volume was published in 1994, in the United States and Canada as ''[[Hellhounds: Panzer Cops]]''. A compilation volume edition was published in 1997.

The English dubbed version of ''Jin-Roh'' was released in North America in 2001.

Two years later, the English subtitled version of the 1987 and 1991 live action films was released on DVD.

===European releases===
''Hellhounds: Panzer Cops'', the English adaptation of the first manga volume, was translated in German and serialized in a German book from 1996 to 1997.

In 1998, the American ''Hellhounds: Panzer Cops'' all-in-one volume was licensed and distributed in the United Kingdom.

The following year ''Jin-Roh'' was premiered in France and later released in Germany. It was one year before the Japanese release.

===Toy lines===

With each new episode release, Japanese toys and model kits manufacturers such as Kaiyodo, Medicom or [[Takara]] produce Protect-Gear scale models.

===Fan works===

After the North American release of Jin-Roh, various Kerberos Protect-Gear skins were created by fans to be used in the popular [[Counter-Strike]] [[First-person shooter|FPS]], an American video game series (1998~2004).

In 2005, ''Images of the Last Battalion'', an independent short anime directed by a student, [[Koichi Kishita]], was released in Japanese film contests. The following year, the bootleg video was edited and projected as an official trailer at Mamoru Oshii's ''[[Kerberos Panzer Jäger]]'' launch party and Kishita joined [[Production I.G]]'s 3DCG team.

Japanese and Chinese Protect-Gear fans sculpted, modified, or repainted licensed toys. Some of these "custom" items are released as limited edition garage kits available in conventions and import action figure shops and websites.

{{nihongo|'''''Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things'''''|怪談|Kaidan|also ''Kwaidan'' (archaic)}}, often shortened to '''''Kwaidan''''' ("[[ghost story]]"), is a book by [[Lafcadio Hearn]] that features several [[kaidan|Japanese ghost stories]] and a brief non-fiction study on insects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stableford]], "Kwaidan", in [[Frank N. Magill]], ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983, {{ISBN|0-89356-450-8}} (pp. 859-860).&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used as the basis for a movie called ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' by [[Masaki Kobayashi]] in 1964.

==Stories==
Hearn declares in his introduction to the first edition of the book, which he wrote on January 20, 1904, shortly before his death, that most of these stories were translated from old Japanese texts. He also states that one of the stories – ''[[Yuki-onna]]'' – was told to him by a farmer in [[Musashi Province]], and his was apparently the first record of it, both by his own account and according to the research of modern folklorists. ''Riki-Baka'' is based on a personal experience of Hearn's. While he does not declare it in his introduction, ''Hi-Mawari'' – among the final narratives in the volume – seems to be a recollection of an experience in his childhood (it is, setting itself apart from almost all the others, written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and set in rural [[Wales]]).

==Insect studies==
In the last half of the book, Hearn listens collected Chinese/Japanese superstitions and his own personal thoughts on various members of the insect world. 
*''[[Butterflies]]'': [[Personification]] of the human [[soul]].
*''[[Mosquitoes]]'': [[Karmic]] [[reincarnation]] of jealous or greedy people in the form of ''Jiki-ketsu-gaki'' or "blood-drinking [[Hungry ghost#In Japan|pretas]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

| Located inside the Arctic Circle in the central part of West Greenland, the site contains the remains of 4,200 years of human history. It is a cultural landscape which bears witness to its creators’ hunting of land and sea animals, seasonal migrations and a rich and well-preserved tangible and intangible cultural heritage linked to climate, navigation and medicine. The features of the site include large winter houses and evidence of caribou hunting, as well as archaeological sites from Paleo-Inuit and Inuit cultures. The cultural landscape includes seven key localities, from Nipisat in the west to Aasivissuit, near the ice-cap in the east. It bears testimony to the resilience of the human cultures of the region and their traditions of seasonal migration.

It bears witness to the cultural histories of the Norse farmer-hunters who started arriving from Iceland in the 10th century and of the Inuit hunters and Inuit farming communities that developed from the end of the 18th century. Despite their differences, the two cultures, European Norse and Inuit, created a cultural landscape based on farming, grazing and marine mammal hunting. The landscape represents the earliest introduction of farming to the Arctic, and the Norse expansion of settlement beyond Europe.

"'''Maxwell's Silver Hammer'''" is a song by the English rock band [[the Beatles]] from their 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]''. It was written by [[Paul McCartney]], although credited to [[Lennon–McCartney]].{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=202}} "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" is a [[pop music|pop]] song with dark, eccentric lyrics about a medical student named Maxwell Edison who commits murders with a hammer. The lyrics are disguised by the upbeat, catchy, and rather "childlike" sound of the song.{{sfn|Mulligan|2010|p=127}} The recording sessions for the track were an acrimonious time for the Beatles, as McCartney pressured his bandmates to work at length on the song. [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] were vocal in their dislike of the song. Author [[Ian MacDonald]] described it as the "single recording [that] shows why The Beatles broke up".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=357}}

==Background==
While in Rishikesh, India, on retreat, Paul began to write the first verse of the song.{{sfn|Howlett|2018|p=21}}{{refn|group=nb|Keeping a notebook by his side during his stay in India, "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" was one of many compositions started by Paul there}} Having completed most of it by October 1968, he intended for its inclusion on the album ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'', but it was never properly recorded during those sessions due to time constraints. It was rehearsed again three months later, in January 1969, at Twickenham film studios during the [[Let It Be#Twickenham rehearsals|''Get Back'' sessions]] but would not be recorded for another six months.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=179}} The film features two brief rehearsal takes compiled together showing the band's progress on the song up to that point. Lennon is shown to be participating on electric guitar despite not featuring on the recording for ''Abbey Road'' at all. Road manager and Beatles associate [[Mal Evans]] participates by providing the [[anvil]] hits.

McCartney's wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]] said that he had become interested in [[avant-garde]] theatre and had immersed himself in the writings of [[Alfred Jarry]].  This influence is reflected in the story and tone of "Maxwell's Silver Hammer", and also explains how McCartney came across Jarry's word "[['Pataphysics|pataphysical]]", which occurs in the lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;McCartney, Linda.  Linda McCartney's Sixties: Portrait of an Era.  Bullfinch Press. Page 153. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon dismissed it as "more of Paul's granny music".{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|p=281}} In 1994, McCartney said that the song epitomises the downfalls of life, being "my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as I was beginning to find out at that time in my life. I wanted something symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't know why it was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer."{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=554}}

==Recording==
The Beatles began recording the song at EMI Studios (later [[Abbey Road Studios]]) in London on 9 July 1969. [[John Lennon]], who had been absent from recording sessions for the previous eight days after being injured in a car crash,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Lennon crashes his car in Scotland|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1969/07/01/john-lennon-crashes-his-car-in-scotland/|website=Beatles Bible|accessdate=2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrived to work on the song, accompanied by his wife, [[Yoko Ono]], who, more badly hurt in the accident than Lennon, lay on a large double-bed in the studio.{{sfn|Miles and Badman|2003}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988}} Sixteen takes of the rhythm track were made, followed by a series of guitar [[overdubs]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988}} The unused fifth take can be heard on ''[[Anthology 3]]''. Over the following two days the group overdubbed vocals, piano, [[Hammond organ]], [[Anvil#Musical instruments|anvil]], and guitar. The song was completed on 6 August, when McCartney recorded a solo on a [[Moog synthesizer]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988}}

The recording process subsequently drew unfavourable comments from Lennon, [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. Lennon said, "I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it", adding later: "I hate it, 'cos all I remember is the track&amp;nbsp;... [Paul] did everything to make it into a single, and it never was and it never could have been."{{sfn|Playboy interviews|1981|p=171}} Harrison recalled: "Sometimes Paul would make us do these really fruity songs. I mean, my God, 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' was so fruity. After a while we did a good job on it, but when Paul got an idea or an arrangement in his head …"{{sfn|Crawdaddy Magazine|1977}} Starr told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 2008: "The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad."{{sfn|Scaggs|Rolling Stone|2008}} McCartney recalled: "The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.'"{{sfn|The Beatles Bible|2009}}

==Reception==
In his 1969 review of ''Abbey Road'', for ''Rolling Stone'', [[John Mendelsohn (musician)|John Mendelsohn]] wrote: "Paul McCartney and [[Ray Davies]] are the only two writers in rock and roll who could have written 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer', a jaunty vaudevillian/music-hallish celebration wherein Paul, in a rare naughty mood, celebrates the joys of being able to bash in the heads of anyone threatening to bring you down. Paul puts it across perfectly with the coyest imaginable choir-boy innocence."{{sfn|Rolling Stone|1969}} [[Robert Christgau]] referred to the song as "a McCartney crotchet".{{sfn|Christgau|1974}}

Among Beatles biographers, [[Ian MacDonald]] said that "If any single recording shows why The Beatles broke up, it's 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'." He continued: "This ghastly miscalculation – of which there are countless equivalents on his garrulous sequence of solo albums – represents by far his worst lapse of taste under the auspices of The Beatles … Thus ''Abbey Road'' embraces both extremes of McCartney: the clear-minded, sensitive caretaker of The Beatles in '[[You Never Give Me Your Money]]' and the Long Medley – and the immature egotist who frittered away the group's patience and solidarity on sniggering nonsense like this."{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=357}} Author Jonathan Gould cites "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" as an example of the selfishness inherent in the Beatles' creative partnership, whereby a composition by McCartney or Lennon would be given preference over a more substantial song by Harrison.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=534–36}} He also rues McCartney's penchant for a [[light entertainment]] style that the Beatles had sought to render obsolete, and concludes: "The sorriest aspect of 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' is thus the way it demonstrates how Paul's workmanlike tendency to build on his past successes had caused him to translate the genuinely charming novelty and subversive parody of '[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]' into a personal subgenre of glibly clever songs that had devolved in the two years since ''Sgt. Pepper'' into a form of musical ''[[schtick]]''."{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=578–79}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16779">A '''miniature book''' is a very small book. Standards for what may be termed a miniature rather than just a small book have changed through time. Today, most collectors consider a book to be miniature only if it is 3 inches or smaller in height, width, and thickness, particularly in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbs.org/|title=What is a miniature book?|last=|first=|date=|website=MIniature Book Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many collectors consider nineteenth-century and earlier books of 4 inches to fit in the category of miniatures.

==History==
Miniature books stretch back far in history; many collections contain [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform tablets]] stretching back thousands of years, and exquisite medieval [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]]. Printers began testing the limits of size not long after the technology of printing began, and around 200 miniature books were printed in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.oxy.edu/special-collections/minibooks/throughtheyears.htm|title=Miniature Books Through the Years|website=sites.oxy.edu|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exquisite specimens from the 17th century abound. In the 19th century, technological innovations in printing enabled the creation of smaller and smaller type.  Fine and popular additions alike grew in number throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/minibooks.htm|title=Miniature Books|last=|first=|date=2012-10-22|work=American Antiquarian Society|access-date=2018-04-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some miniature books are objects of high craft, bound in fine [[Morocco|Moroccan]] leather, with [[Gilding|gilt]] decoration and excellent examples of [[woodcuts]], etchings, and [[watermarks]], others are cheap, disposable, sometimes highly functional items not expected to survive. Today, miniature books are produced both as fine works of craft and as commercial products found in chain bookstores.

Some popular types of miniature books from various periods include [[Bible|Bibles]], [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedias]], [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[Bilingual dictionary|Bilingual dictionaries,]] [[Short story|short stories]], [[Poetry|verse]], famous speeches, [[Propaganda|political propaganda]], [[Guide book|travel guides]], [[Almanac|almanacs]], children's stories, and the miniaturization of well-known books such as ''[[The Compleat Angler]]'', ''[[The Art of War]]'', and [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

=== "Smallest Book in the World" ===
Many books have claim to the title of smallest book in the world at the time of their publication. The title can apply to a variety of accomplishments: smallest overall size, smallest book with [[movable type]], smallest printed book, smallest book legible to the naked eye, and so on.

750: ''Hyakumantō darani'' or ‘One Million Pagoda Dharani.' Also one of the earliest known printed texts, these 2-3/8" tall Buddhist charms were printed, rolled into a scroll, placed in miniature white pagodas, and distributed to Buddhist temples. A million were printed at the command of Japanese [[Empress Shotoku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkQdDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=oldest+buddhist+printed+million+copies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=prAWVYNX_V&amp;sig=0qYFt2ojnuJTY2-9NQP-e9U4kGQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY27W61LraAhVRNd8KHXZhDkUQ6AEIWjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=oldest%20buddhist%20printed%20million%20copies&amp;f=false|title=The Paper Trail: An Unexpected History of a Revolutionary Invention|last=Monro|first=Alexander|date=2017-02-21|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780307456694|location=|pages=132|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, archaeologists found a miniature Bible (Glasgow: David Bryce &amp; Son, 1901) tucked into a child's boot hidden in a chimney cavity in an English cottage attic. Shoes were placed in such locations as early as the fourteenth-century as anti-witchcraft devices known as "spirit traps."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1786490/posts|title=World's Smallest Bible Found in a Boot|last=Viegas|first=Jennifer|date=February 9, 2007|website=Discovery News|archive-url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1786490/posts|archive-date=February 17, 2007|dead-url=|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing, Printing, and Binding in Miniature ==
The creation of a miniature book requires exceptional skill in all aspects of book production, because elements such as bindings, pages, and type, illustrations, and subject matter all need to be approached with a new set of problems in mind. For instance, the pages of a miniature book do not fall open as do those of larger books, because the pages are not heavy enough. Bindings require exceptionally thin materials, and creating type that is readable and beautiful requires great skill. Many printers have created miniature books to test their own technical limits or to show off their skill. Many books have claimed the sought-after title of "smallest book in the world," which is now held by experiments in nanoprinting.

The '''Mycenaean palace amphora with octopus''' in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] (NAMA) with inventory number Π 6725 is dated to the 15th century BC. It was found in the second grave of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] cemetery at [[Prosymna]], near [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Kaltsas: ''The National Archaeological Museum'', 2007, {{ISBN|978-960-89339-2-7}}, p. 145 ([http://www.latsis-foundation.org/eng/electronic-library/the-museum-cycle/the-national-archaeological-museum online])&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a three-handled [[amphora]], which belongs to the category of the so-called Palace amphorae, which arrived in the Greek mainland in the [[Late Helladic]] II A period (around the first half of the 15th century BC) and was heavily influenced by [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace amphorae.&lt;ref&gt;On palace amphorae, see: [[Penelope A. Mountjoy]] ''Mycenaean Pottery. An Introduction.'' Oxford University Press, 2nd edition. 2001, pp. 44f.&lt;/ref&gt; It is decorated with a sea-themed scene, with rocks, seaweed, and three large octopodes, whose long tentacles wind around the whole vase. The work is attributed to a Mycenaean vase painter who was working entirely within the tradition of Cretan [[Minoan pottery|Minoan vase painting]].

The museum’s 39 exhibition rooms cover 8,460 square meters and present more than 100,000 objects. It is home to 30 million objects available to more than 60 [[Scientist|scientists]] and numerous guest researchers who carry out basic research in a wide range of topics related to [[Human science|human sciences]], [[Earth science|earth sciences]], and [[List of life sciences|life sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural History Museum Vienna - A guide to the collections|last=Jovanovic-Kruspel|first=Stefanie|publisher=Naturhistorisches Museum Wien|year=2012|isbn=|location=Wien|pages=5, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Sauriersaal des NHM Wien.JPG|thumb|One of the museum's halls]]The history of the Natural History Museum Vienna is shaped by the passion for collecting of renowned [[Monarch|monarchs]], the endless thirst for knowledge of famous scientists, and the spirit of adventure of travelling researchers. True to the spirit of the inscription carved into the front of the museum, scientists at the NHM Vienna have over the centuries dedicated themselves and their work “to the realm of [[nature]] and its [[exploration]]”.

While in the 19th century this was expressed through major imperial research expeditions to little-known corners of the [[Earth]], today it can be found in modern [[DNA]] analysis methods and [[meteorite]] research providing insights into unfamiliar worlds and the outer extremes of our [[cosmos]]. 

The earliest collections of the Natural History Museum Vienna date back more than 250 years. It was [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Franz I Stephan of Lorraine]], [[Maria Theresa]]’s husband, who in 1750 purchased what was at the time the world’s largest and most famous collection of natural history objects from the Florentine scholar and scientist Jean de Baillou. This was the first step on the road to creating the Natural History Museum Vienna.

Baillou’s collection comprised 30,000 objects, including [[Fossils|rare fossils]], [[Snail|snails]], [[Mussel|mussels]], and [[Coral|corals]], as well as valuable [[Mineral|minerals]] and [[Gemstone|precious stones]]. 

Franz I Stephan of Lorraine, who founded the [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn|Schönbrunn zoo]] in 1752 and the botanical garden in 1753, also organized the first scientific overseas expedition. In 1755 he commissioned [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin|Nicolaus Joseph Jacquin]] to travel to the [[Caribbean]], the [[Antilles]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]]. Jacquin returned from this expedition with many live animals and plants for the zoo and the botanical garden, as well as 67 cases full of other items of interest from the natural world.

After the Emperor’s death, Maria Theresa gave the natural science collection to the state and opened it up to the general public. Thus she created the first museum in line with the principles and visions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

It was Maria Theresa who brought the famous [[mineralogist]] [[Ignaz von Born]] to Vienna. Born, who had developed a new method of extracting precious metals, was tasked with classifying and expanding the collections. To this end he had minerals from many different regions sent to Vienna, where they were added to the collection. Under the leadership of Ignaz von Born the cabinet of natural history quickly developed into a center of practical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/museum/history__architecture|title=the history of the nhm vienna|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expeditions ===

==== Expedition to the Brazilian rainforests ====
To mark the marriage of his daughter Leopoldine to the heir to the Portuguese throne, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Franz II]] organized an expedition to her new home country of [[Brazil]] in 1817. Two Austrian frigates accompanied the [[Archduke|archduchess]] on her journey to [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].

Those taking part in the expedition, carried out under the scientific direction of the head of the history collection, included the researchers Johann Mikan and Johann Emmanuel, as well as the taxidermist [[Johann Natterer]] and the landscape painter [[Thomas Ender|Thomas Ender.]] The expedition lasted 18 years aimed to collect all plants, animals, and minerals of scientific interest and bring them back to Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/museum/history__architecture/expeditions_in_the_19th_century|title=expeditions in the 19th century|last=|first=|date=November 2018|website=www.nhm-wien.ac.at|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Novara sails the globe ====
The most ambitious Austrian expedition was carried out by the [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS Novara]], a [[frigate]] which sailed the world between 1857 and 1859. The scientific responsibility for this expedition was shared by the [[Academy of sciences|Academy of Sciences]] and the Geography Society. The man behind the project was [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian]], Commander in Chief of the Austrian Navy. 

Among the advisors was the famous naturalist and researcher [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Many well-known scientists took part in the two-year journey, including the geologist [[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]], ethnologist [[Karl von Scherzer]] and zoologist [[Georg Ritter von Frauenfeld]]. The entire journey was documented in hundreds of sketches and paintings by the landscape artist Josef Selleny. The scientists returned home with a vast haul of minerals, animals, plants and items of [[Ethnology|ethnological]] interest. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/museum/history__architecture/expeditions_in_the_19th_century|title=expeditions in the 19th century|last=|first=|date=November 2018|website=www.nhm-wien.ac.at|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Tegetthoff travels into the ice ====
The last significant research expedition of the 19th century was the [[Tegetthoff-class battleship|Tegetthoff]] North Pole Expedition (1872 – 1874) led by [[Julius von Payer]] and [[Carl Weyprecht]]. On August 30, 1873 the participants on board discovered [[Franz Josef Land|Franz Joseph Land]]. 

With the Tegetthoff at risk of breaking up under the pressure of the ice, the members of the expedition were forced to leave the ship. On May 20, 1874 they began their long retreat to the south, transporting their equipment and provisions on sleds and boats. 
Despite many sacrifices and great danger, the scientists returned to Vienna with both their invaluable travel journals and observations of the landscape, as well as a number of natural history items of interest welded into metal cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en/museum/history__architecture/expeditions_in_the_19th_century|title=expeditions in the 19th century|last=|first=|date=November 2018|website=www.nhm-wien.ac.at|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building ==
[[File:Naturhistorisches Museum Wien 2013 Haupttreppe.jpg|thumb|Main staircase in the museum building]]

The main building of the museum is an elaborate palace that has accommodated these constantly growing collections, since opening to the public in 1889 as the [[Imperial Natural History Museum]].&lt;ref name="NotesNM"&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/d/museum.html NHM-Wien-overview], "Museum of Natural History in [[Vienna]]" (overview), ''Naturhistorisches Museum [[Vienna|Wien]]'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some of the collections had been moved from even older buildings, such as the [[Austrian National Library]], which contained the Zoology Cabinet (German: ''Tierkabinett'') collections.&lt;ref name=HistNM&gt;"History (Hauptframe)" (overview), ''Naturhistorisches Museum'', [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], 2011, webpage:[http://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/NHM/2Zoo/welcomehis_e.html NHMW-history].&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction of the building, its ornate decoration, furniture and precious exhibits makes the museum itself an artifact for historical preservation.&lt;ref name=NotesNM/&gt;

Famous and irreplaceable exhibits{{spaced ndash}}for instance, the 25,000-year-old [[Venus of Willendorf]], a copy of the skeleton of a ''[[Diplodocus]]'' [[dinosaur]] (Diplodocus carnegii) (a gift from Andrew Carnegie) and specimens of long-extinct lifeforms such as [[Steller's sea cow]]{{spaced ndash}}are displayed across thirty-nine halls. A contemporary presentation of the exhibits, using modern exhibition technology, has been possible without any destruction of the building's historical structures.&lt;ref name=NotesNM/&gt;

== Displays ==
[[Image:Venus of Willendorf 03.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Venus of Willendorf]].]]

On the upper floor (''Hochparterre'') [[precious stone]]s, [[mineral]]s (some with origin in old [[Renaissance]] collections) and [[meteorite]]s (the largest display collection in the world) can be seen, along with large [[dinosaur]] displays and rare [[fossil]]s, and along with [[prehistoric art]] works: the ''[[Venus of Willendorf|Venus von Willendorf]]'', the [[skeleton]] of ''[[Diplodocus]]'', a giant [[topaz]] [[crystal]] weighing 117&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] (258&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]), and the gemstone-and-diamond bouquet of flowers which [[Maria Theresia]] had made as a present for her husband.&lt;ref name="NotesNME"&gt;[http://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/d/engvorschau.html NHM-Wien-preview-English], "Museum of Natural History in Vienna" (English overview), ''Naturhistorisches Museum Wien'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first floor displays the species variety of the animal world, from [[protozoa]] to [[insect]]s to highly developed [[mammal]]s. Objects over 200 years old are of interest, not only on their own account but also as historical records for the [[history of science]] and the art of [[taxidermy]]: numerous stuffed animals of species either extinct, or extremely endangered, have made the collections irreplaceable.&lt;ref name=NotesNME/&gt;

Note that some signs and explanations in the museum are in [[German language|German]], while much of the museum is in [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] following a recent renovation.

'''''Not Dark Yet: A personal history''''' is a 2004 book Australian cultural historian [[David Walker (Historian)|David Walker]], who suffered a sudden and severe loss of sight due to macular degeneration which limited his ability to continue archival research and forced him to "find another, more personal voice and another way of writing".&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, ''Not Dark Yet: A personal history'', Giramondo, Sydney, 2011, back cover&lt;/ref&gt; The book documents his own and his family's relationship to the past. This was a significant departure from Walker's academic work in which he is a pre-eminent authority on Australia's engagement with Asia. However, through this book, Walker found that the personal has a role in the writing of history; "small events also have their place in determining who we are and what we value as individuals and as a community".

==Summary==
''Not Dark Yet'' traces the story of  Walker's family over five generations; from the settlement of his great-great grandparents in South Australia in the 1850s until the death of his mother in the 1990s. Many of the early chapters are set in [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]], a copper mining town 156&amp;nbsp;km (97&amp;nbsp;miles) north of Adelaide, where his family were well-known shopkeepers.  Of particular significance is the story of Luke Day, a relative through marriage and a Chinese merchant in Burra. Here the personal narrative intersects with the author's academic interests and Walker uses Day's life to re-examine the position held by the Chinese in Australian society during a period when Australian racial nationalism and the resultant [[White Australia Policy]] were  strident.&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, ''Not Dark Yet: A personal History'', Giramondo, Sydney, 2011, pp 29-47&lt;/ref&gt; Walker captures the essence of life in a small Australian town at the beginning of the twentieth century with all its strengths, limitations and petty jealousies.

In later sections of the book Walker intimately describes the lives of his parents and his own journey into academia.  Australia's engagement with Asia is again given prominence through the description of the devastating effects that the Second World War had on the author's family. When he was a child, Walker was unaware of the fate of uncle Laurie and mention of his name lead to uncomfortable silences. This led Walker to use his historian's skills to investigate Laurie's life. He discovered that his uncle had volunteered for service with the [[No. 13 Squadron RAAF|13th squadron]] of the RAAF and had been posted to [[Ambon Island|Ambon]]. He had attempted to escape from the island when it was overrun by the  [[Battle of Ambon|advancing Japanese]] but through a series of fateful mishaps  was captured and executed in the [[Battle of Ambon#Laha massacre|Laha Massacre]] of Australian prisoners of war. The brutality and apparent pointlessness of Laurie's death resonated in the Walker family over the next two generations.&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, ''Not Dark Yet: A personal history'', Giramondo, Sydney, 2011, pp.138-157&lt;/ref&gt; The book also explores the lives of two other uncles whose lives were affected by the war. One served in [[No. 467 Squadron RAAF|467 squadron]] of the RAAF with [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] and another with the [[2/43rd Battalion (Australia)|2/43rd Battalion]] in North Africa, New Guinea and Borneo. A further poignant episode is Walker's gentle description of his mother's decline into dementia and subsequent death.&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, ''Not Dark Yet: A personal history'', Giramondo, Sydney, 2011, pp296-312&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these tragedies the book's premise is one of joy and optimism. This is achieved through the author's  wit and good-natured humour in the face of misfortune. A single example in the first chapter sets the tone of the book. When his ophthalmologist told him that he was now "legally blind", his immediate response was to ask if it was possible for him to be "illegally blind" instead.&lt;ref&gt;David Walker, ''Not Dark Yet: A personal history'', Giramondo, Sydney, 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==

''Not Dark Yet'' received  an extensive and positive critical response. Kerryn Goldsworthy  in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' wrote that ''Not Dark Yet'' was an "intriguing and engaging book... made even more readable by Walker's personality, which comes across as modest, funny and wry as he tells (his) stories. He's stoic but realistic about his precarious physical state and mildly self-reproaching for having, as a professional historian, undervalued the idea of family history for so long...the book exerts the same powerful grip on the reader as the family chronicles and sagas of good 19th-century fiction and has the same kind of deep, complicated, personal appeal."&lt;ref&gt;Kerryn Goldsworthy, “Family Gets its Place in History", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 9/4/11, Spectrum p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Tom Griffiths of the [[Australian National University]] described the book as “a charismatic and enigmatic work... curious, wry, poignant and sweet”. It combined elements of, "a memoir, a family history, a cultural history of modern Australia, a study of memory, legend and storytelling, an investigation of national character, a local and regional study, a reflection on history and the historian’s craft, an auto-ethnography".&lt;ref&gt;Tom Griffiths, “Not Dark Yet: A personal history", {{cite web |url=http://www.deakin.edu.au/research-services/news/2011/03/08/not-dark-yet---a-personal-history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529051254/http://www.deakin.edu.au/research-services/news/2011/03/08/not-dark-yet---a-personal-history |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }}, accessed 20/5/12&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Levasseur in ''[[The Australian]]'' found Walker to be "a delightful, witty guide who balances thorough research with banter. While his memoir moves through some of the darkest moments of contemporary and personal history, including World War II atrocities and mental breakdowns, he maintains a fluid, easy style that combines empathy with cheekiness".&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Levasseur, “Visible Darkness", http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/visible-darkness/story-e6frg8nf-1226021667661, accessed 20/5/12&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Moore writing in [[Labor History (journal)|''Labour History'']] discovered interconnections between Walker's family history and his long term academic interests. The stories told in ''Not Dark Yet'' emphasised elements of Australian cultural development and the history of Australia's engagement with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Moore, “David Walker, Not Dark Yet: A Personal History.(Book review)", ''Labour History: A Journal of Labour and Social History'', 101 (Nov 2011): p213 (2)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phillip Adams]] described the book as “an evocative portrait of 20th century Australia …the attitudes, idiosyncrasies and prejudices of the era.”&lt;ref&gt;Philip Adams, “Not Dark Yet – Walker”, http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2011/3182038.htm, accessed 20/9/11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1403">'''Porphyrogeniture''', also sometimes referred to as '''born to the purple''', is a system of political succession that favours the rights of sons born after their father has become king or emperor, over older siblings born before their father's ascent to the throne.

Examples of this practice include [[Byzantium]] and the [[Nupe Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Goody, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 11th century England and Normandy, the theory of porphyrogeniture was used by [[Henry I of England]] to justify why he, and not his older brother [[Robert Curthose]], should inherit the throne after the death of their brother [[William Rufus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Wilsun, who previously co-founded [[Dogtown Poetry Theater]] with Joe Scozzy, was a driving force in the founding of Red Sky Poetry Theatre. Along with Joe Keppler, Tom Parson, who also started the [[Bumbershoot]] Small Press Fair in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowitsuptoyou.com/more_info.htm ''Now It's Up to You Publications'']
	"Tom Parson (Now it's Up to You Publications) was active in Seattle's poetry community, organizing the first Small Press Book fair at the annual Bumbershoot Festival in 1977, helping to organize the Red Sky Poetry Theatre..,"  accessed May 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Judith Roche]], whose home was used as a meeting place to plan Red Sky Poetry Theatre,  Wilsun formed the core of what would become Red  Sky Poetry Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Marshall, 'Scuse Me While I Kiss Red Sky, ''UW Daily'', February 23, 1990 Pg 8, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to forming Red Sky Poetry Theatre, Wilsun held ad hoc readings which were simply called Poetry Theatre. Wilsun  named  his labor of love Red Sky because one day he was putting up flyers for his Poetry Theatre in the [[Pike Place Market]] and as he was doing so, saw an amazing red sunset. He wrote a poem at the Soup and Salad called Red Sky. It inspired him to name his Poetry Theatre, Red Sky.&lt;ref&gt;"Poetry Theatre", [[Seattle Sun (alternative weekly)|''Seattle Sun'']], June 10, 1981 Page 7, 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finding the poetry"&gt;Rajhet Dirzhud-Rashid, "Finding the poetry in a Red Sky", ''[[Capitol Hill Times]]'', February 28, 1990 Page, 5, 9&lt;/ref&gt; The first Red Sky Poetry Theatre reading was May 24, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Open Sound Volume 4 No 3'', November 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Shively, Joseph Keppler, Judith Roche, Matt Lennon, and Tom Parsons joined the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board in 1981&lt;ref name="No Limit"&gt;Phil West, At Red Sky, [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920117&amp;slug=1470776 "There's No Limit For Experimenting Poets"], ''Seattle Times'', January 17, 1992, accessed May 31, 2014 "It's a tight-knit group of regulars that meets each Sunday at the Ditto Tavern for Red Sky Poetry Theatre. They're not afraid to experiment with new poems in front of each other. They heckle each other from time to time. And at an open-mike session a few weeks ago, readers even took turns wearing a silly green top hat during their moments in front of the audience."&lt;/ref&gt; and were listed in the original incorporation documents as board members in 1982 with Don Wilsun as President and acting agent.&lt;ref&gt;Articles of Incorporation of the Red Sky Poetry Theatre, Ralph Monroe, Secretary of State, State of Washington, May 17, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Red Sky Poetry Theatre was a Non-profit Organization existing solely to promote and encourage poetry performance and [[Performance Art]] as well as other arts.

Trudy Mercer, an early editor of ''SkyViews'', joined the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Gold, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yhTCVZ3iQncC&amp;pg=PA160 ''Publishing Lives: Interviews with Independent Book Publishers in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia''], (Mill Creek, WA, Black Heron Press,  1990), Page 76, 160, 567, accessed May 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the same day Marion Kimes&lt;ref&gt;Good Reads, [http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/551499.Marion_Kimes Marion Kimes: about this author], accessed June 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Hureaux were voted onto the board.

Kay Kinghammer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mciwritershouse.com/writers.html MCI Writer's House], accessed June 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and JT Stewart,&lt;ref name=Hugo&gt;[http://hugohouse.org/event/red-sky-poetry-theater/ Hugo House Event, Red Sky Reunion 2010] Accessed May 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; who formerly taught at [[Seattle Central Community College]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mudede, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/readings-listings/Content?oid=9544 Readings Listings], ''The Stranger'', December 13, 2001, accessed June 10, 2014.

Stewart is a poet and teaches English at SCCC...,"&lt;/ref&gt; were also part of the early Red Sky Poetry Theatre board.

	Other early affiliated authors not officially on the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board included Mark Svenvold, who recently did a presentation at the [[Modern Language Association]] about the influence of Red Sky Poetry Theatre on the Literary World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/conv_listings_detail?prog_id=S821&amp;year=2012 Modern Language Association Convention Program information from 2012], accessed May 28, 2014 
	"There one found a poetic procedure fueled by an allegiance to performance and informed by a resistance to canonical Euro-centric influences. At Red Sky one found anthropology and alternative ways of viewing the universe. One found study of Neolithic cultures, of tribal cultures, of Native American cultures, of anything that spoke to an ancient "oral tradition." There was history aplenty at Red Sky"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Potts|Charlie Potts]], another well known author, would frequently read for Red Sky Poetry Theatre.&lt;ref name="Seek the Sacred"&gt;Ralph La Charity, [http://www.oocities.org/soho/cafe/1492/Others-Essays/ess0002a.html ''Seek the Sacred / Share the Secrets''] accessed June 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Hunter,&lt;ref&gt;[[KSTS]] 9, ''[[PBS News Hour]]'', [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment-july-dec07-ripening_07-09/ "Hunter Discusses Reshaping 'Shopworn' Language"], July 9, 2007 accessed June 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KSTS 9, ''PBS News Hour'', [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/poetry/paul-hunter/ "Paul Hunter"], accessed June 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; who collaborated with Red Sky Poetry Theatre early on, would officially become a board member in 1993.  These authors added much to the early Red Sky Poetry Theatre creative process.

== Bumbershoot ==
Charlie Burks, the coordinator of the first Bumbershoot Writers in Performance Competition in 1981,&lt;ref name=Bards&gt;Kate Robinson, "The Battle of the Bards", ''University Herald'', Page 1, 9, February 1981&lt;/ref&gt; was not officially on the board but collaborated with Red Sky Poetry Theatre on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dianne Simmon, They're Performing Poetry: 'Deserve to be Read Out Loud',  ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' August 1, 1981 Pg D-1&lt;/ref&gt; Burks' influence on the collaborative efforts of Red Sky Poetry Theatre was substantial. The expression "Poet's Gymnasium", in the context of Red Sky Poetry Theatre as a forum for perfecting one's poetry, is attributed to Burks.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Phalen, [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930304&amp;slug=1688594 "Poetry As A Contact Sport -- Rhythm And Rhyme In Your Face Can Be Beautiful And Bombastic, But It's Never Boring"], ''Seattle Times'', March 4, 1993, accessed May 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phoebe Bosché, Words Off the Page: Poetry in Performance, ''Arts Focus Volume 7 Number 6'' , January 1988, Page 1, 4, 5&lt;/ref&gt; Red Sky Poetry Theatre joined Burks in judging the Writers in Performance contests that would decide who, out of hundreds, would read at Bumbershoot. Bumbershoot Writers in Performance Competitions continue to this day, although without Red Sky Poetry Theatre. However, former board member Judith Roche coordinated the Bumbershoot Literary Arts Festival&lt;ref&gt;Donn Fry, [community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900826 Author! Author! Readings, Panels Planned], Seattle Times Arts and Entertainment, August 26, 1990 accessed January 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Bumbershoot#One Reel Takes Over|One Reel]] after Red Sky Poetry Theatre discontinued the Bumbershoot Association.&lt;ref&gt;David Berger, [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950205&amp;slug=2103335 "Bumbershoot Is In Trouble; Here's How To Fix It"], February 5, 1995 accessed July 11, 2014
"There's a model for this already: Judith Roche and Louise DiLenge mostly call the shots for Bumbershoot's literary arts. Not coincidentally, these are among the best aspects of Bumbershoot, consistently thoughtful and daring."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Periodicals ==
Bill Shively edited the very first ''Open Sky'' in which writers and  visual artists of any sort could contribute 400 pages to be included in the magazine. Red Sky Poetry Theatre considered its collective efforts to be more conducive to the creative process, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Essentially, ''Open Sky'' wasn't edited so much as compiled. Shively's brainchild, ''Open Sky'', eventually became a quarterly publication. The only person to submit to all twelve issues of ''Open Sky'' was author Dann O'Keefe.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Writing Online, [http://www.writing.ie/tell-your-own-story/unpublishable/ "Unpublishable? Do It Yourself"] accessed June 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; ''Open Sky'' became ''Open Sound'' in 1989 with 200 pages. Ezra Mark was the editor of the first ''Open Sound''. Ezra Mark&lt;ref&gt;Internet Archive, [https://archive.org/details/SoundPoetryNight32312SeattleWa Sound Poetry Night, 3/23/12, Seattle, WA], accessed June 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; was later on the board of Subtext, another poetry series.&lt;ref&gt;Stacie Lavine, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/from-1994-until-infinity/Content?oid=14755 "From 1994 Until Infinity, The Persistence of Language and the Subtext Poetry Reading Series"],''The Stranger'', June 26, 2003, accessed June 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Shively created and edited the early ''SkyViews'' magazine which started out as a monthly newsletter with 'guest editors' but became a full-fledged poetry magazine shortly after the first issues. Charlie Burks added a 'Sunday Supplement' one month when he was guest editor that was much admired by the [[Pacific Northwest]] literary public. Trudy Mercer took over the compilation of this monthly magazine in 1984. Mercer published ''Redlines'' as well as working with Red Sky Poetry Theatre. ''SkyViews'' was renamed ''Parallel Discourse'' in 1989 with Phoebe Bosché and James Maloney as editors although it still referred to itself as ''SkyViews'' inside the first ''Parallel Discourse'' pages.&lt;ref&gt;Up In The Air, ''Parallel Discourse (SkyViews Volume 3 Numbers 4/5)'' combined issue, January, 1989, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; ''Parallel Discourse'' soon spun off of Red Sky Poetry Theatre completely and was solely published by Bosché and Maloney.
''Swale Magazine'' was edited by Bosché and Roberto Valenza but it was not actually a Red Sky Poetry Theatre publication. ''Swale'' was well received.

	Red Sky Poetry Theatre also had its own imprint called, of course, Red Sky Press. It published books of collected poets such as ''Red Sky Morning'' as well as publishing the ''Bumbershoot Anthology'', a collection of the poems of the Bumbershoot Literary Contest performers, in 1984 and 1985. [[Visual Art]] was always part of the Red Sky Poetry Theatre milieu and many publications were replete with images such as the art of Keppler, Lennon,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Bernstein, On a Linoleum Print by Matt Lennon,  ''Arts Focus Volume 4 Number 3'', December 1990, Page 16&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Valenza,&lt;ref&gt;Guard Rail Gallery, [http://www.garde-rail.com/exhibits/ready.html Ready Or Not, Here We Come], accessed June 9, 2014
	"Roberto Valenza has 'been a poet longer than a painter' and his poetry overflows onto his canvas. His paintings, done in charcoal, pastels, and acrylic, display a fluidity of movement fitting to his scenes of animals, mother earth, and other-worldly natives."&lt;/ref&gt; or Grace Dager&lt;ref&gt;Cydney Gillis, Alternative To Loud Boats Arts Festival, ''Arts Focus Volume 3 Number 1'', Page 5, 12&lt;/ref&gt; {{dead link|date=July 2018}} and many others. The line between poetry and visual art was consistently crossed as the two forms merged into something unique.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Degaetano, Video Artists Use Technology For Social Commentary, Seattle Downtown Magazine, April 1988, Page 13-15&lt;/ref&gt; There were many other publications by Red Sky Poetry Theatre affiliated authors that are too numerous to list.

==Early History==
When Don Wilsun withdrew from regular participation in Red Sky Poetry Theatre, the Secretary of State of Washington State listed Elliott Bronstein as the acting Agent for Red Sky Poetry Theatre and Marion Kimes as the acting President and Treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.wa.gov/corps/search_detail.aspx?ubi=601106410 Washington Business 501- C], accessed May 25, 2014 	
	Red Sky Poetry Theatre  Washington Non-Profit Corporation
The Registered Agent on file for this company is Elliott Bronstein...
The company has 1 principal on record. The President and Treasurer is Marion Kimes.&lt;/ref&gt; Red Sky Poetry Theatre presented a continuous live poetry series for more than the 25 years that it was incorporated. This puts Red Sky Poetry Theatre on the same par as [[City Lights Books]], which has been running a poetry series since 1953, and [[Nuyorican]] Poets Cafe, which has had a series since 1973. Red Sky Poetry Theatre still does occasional Red Sky Redux&lt;ref&gt;''The Stranger'', June 20, 1012 [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/red-sky-redux/Event?event=13949562 "Red Sky Redux at Hopvine"], Accessed May 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; at the Hopvine Pub&lt;ref&gt;''The Stranger'', [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/hopvine-pub/Location?oid=24344 "Hopvine Pub (Capitol Hill)"],  Accessed May 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or venues such as the [[Richard Hugo House]].&lt;ref name=Hugo/&gt; Red Sky Poetry Theatre board membership changed much over the course of 25 incorporated years.

Red Sky Poetry Theatre held their first readings at the Soames Dunn Building in the Pike Place Market&lt;ref name=Bards/&gt; and continued there for more than a year, then moving to the Pike Development Authority meeting room for 6 months.&lt;ref name="Take a Reading"&gt;Donn Fry, "Take a Reading: Seattle's lively poetry scene provides listeners with a wealth of vibrant verse", ''Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer'', April 13, 1986 Page L-1, 7&lt;/ref&gt; From there, Red Sky Poetry Theatre stayed in the Pike Place Market and started reading in December, 1983 at the Soup and Salad Cafe overlooking [[Puget Sound]]. This was the first venue where people who weren't looking for Red Sky Poetry Theatre could come across them and walk in.

Michael Hureaux, who was an active member of Red Sky Poetry Theatre, was the instigator that convinced Red Sky Poetry Theatre to move to the Five-O Tavern on [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] in December 1984,&lt;ref name="Take a Reading"/&gt; thus changing the ambiance of the performance stage, when the Soup and Salad turned into the Soundview Cafe. Hureaux had already staged Poem People: Poetry Night at the Five-O Tavern and found the location conducive to poetry. (The Five-O later became the Hopvine Pub). The Five-O was an early venue for the fledgling Seattle [[Grunge]] Rock scene.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Humphrey, [http://www.miscmedia.com/category/real-estate/page/15/ Metropolist 150], ''Misc Media,'',

Hureaux left the board in 1986 to pursue other interests,&lt;ref&gt;Trisha Ready, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/marxist-circus/Content?oid=11921 "Marxist Circus The Art and Politics of Michael Perez-Hureaux"] ''The Stranger'', September 12, 2002, accessed June 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; including becoming a member of the [[Choreopoem|Choreopoets]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand M. De Leon, [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910614&amp;slug=1289087 "Wordsmiths Listen, Give Support"] ''Seattle Times'' June 14, 1991 accessed July 11, 2014 "I think people are recovering their voice, picking up where the black arts movement of the 60s left off," Hureaux said."&lt;/ref&gt;

The renowned Pioneer Square Theater&lt;ref&gt;Carl Sander, [http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=10235 Pioneer Square Theater], October 31, 2012, accessed May 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University Libraries University of Washington, [http://digital.lib.washington.edu/findingaids/view?docId=PioneerSquareTheater4067.xml Preliminary Guide to the Pioneer Square Theater Records 1980-1989], accessed June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; hosted Red Sky Poetry Theatre Works In Progress such as Charlie Burks "War Babies", in 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref name="First Day of Spring"&gt;Trudy Mercer, "The First Day of Spring", ''SkyViews'', March 20, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneer Square Theater continued working with Red Sky Poetry Theatre affiliated authors such as Roberto Valenza,&lt;ref name="Deli Man"&gt;Regina Hackett, "'Deli Man': Poet's glorious mess is rescued by language", ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' What's Happening, February 7, 1986 Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; although the connections with Red Sky Poetry Theatre were no longer direct.

In fact, Red Sky Poetry Theatre was so involved with the Seattle performance culture, that it was hard to tell where Red Sky Poetry Theatre ended and another organization began. Members worked with [[On the Boards]] performing in the 1982 Poetry Marathon to benefit [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Seldin, Vagabond Poet Program Notes, 100 Poets Read to Benefit Amnesty International; it's a Poetry Marathon, December 5, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Lennon hosted a monthly reading at the Comet Tavern, where Red Sky Poetry Theatre would cross pollinate with the Actor's Table. Joe Keppler hosted readings at the Greenwood Gallery&lt;ref&gt;''Bumbershoot 1983 Literary Arts Magazine'', What is Red Sky Poetry Theatre? Page 8
	"However it's described, everyone agrees on one thing - that Red sky Poetry Theatre is alive and well- and thriving all over the City. There is a monthly Reading hosted by Matt Lennon at the Comet Tavern and another hosted by Joe Keppler at the Greenwood Gallery."&lt;/ref&gt; before he left in 1983 to form "Poets, Painters, Composers"&lt;ref name="Take a Reading"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Andrews, [http://www.vispo.com/guests/keppler/intro.htm The First Remainder Series] by Joe Keppler, ''Vispo'', accessed June 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this flexibility which made it so easy to move venues as needed without harming the free-spirited, collaborative nature of  Red Sky Poetry Theatre.&lt;ref name="Finding the poetry"/&gt;

Phoebe Bosché and Roberto Valenza became Red Sky Poetry Theatre board members in 1984 and were influential in taking Red Sky Poetry Theatre in new directions toward [[Performance Poetry]].&lt;ref name="No Limit"/&gt; Bosché recently edited Art and Politics Now Cultural Activism in a Time of Crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Noyes Platt, ''Art and Politics Now Cultural Activism in a Time of Crisis'', (New York, NY Midmarch Arts Press, Mar 1, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Bosché currently publishes ''Raven Chronicles'' with Philip H. Red Eagle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ravenchronicles.org/raven/rvinfo.html Raven Chronicles], accessed June 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckling gave a spontaneity and comedic value to performances although many of the other readers frowned upon it.&lt;ref name="No Limit"/&gt;
 
The 1980s found Red Sky Poetry Theatre receiving grants from the King County Arts Commission,&lt;ref name="Alternative 8/4"&gt;Alternative to Load Boats Set for August 4, ''The Arts; King County Arts Commission Newsletter Volume 20 Number 5'', July 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Allied Arts of Seattle|Allied Arts Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliedarts-foundation.org/ Allied Arts Foundation], accessed June 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; the Seattle Arts Commission&lt;ref name="First Day of Spring"/&gt; and [[911 Media Arts Center]],&lt;ref&gt;Regina Hackett, [http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/911-Media-Arts-Center-to-the-rescue-1091003.php "911 Media Arts Center to the rescue: A ragtag band of art populists and techies turns a media-arts center into a success story"], ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', July 10, 2002, accessed June 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed Red Sky Poetry Theatre to expand into other media.

== Broadcasts ==
There were two radio shows affiliated with Red Sky Poetry Theatre in the early years, both on [[KNDD|KRAB-FM]] from 1981 through 1983. There was Red Sky Radio hosted by Matt Lennon and Art Talk hosted by Don Wilsun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krab.fm/ProgramGuides/KRAB-Guide-xxx-1984-01.pdf KRAB-FM Radio Program Guide 1984] Matt Lennon  Red Sky at Night Page 2 accessed June 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Sky Poetry Theatre would branch off into [[Public Access Television]] hosted by [[TCI Cable]] in 1985 starting with the Paramount Poets by Alan Goodin and Martina Poth Goodin, both Red Sky Poetry Theatre board members since 1984. They would continue the tradition of video poetry with Cactus Poets, the show starting production in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Donn Fry, Video Verse: Poetry comes alive before the camera, ''Seattle Times Post-Intelligencer'' Joint Sunday Issue July 7, 1987  Pg L1,8&lt;/ref&gt;  Red Sky Poetry Theatre Live would air, also on TCI, in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;John Vorhees, Casting is the savior tomorrow in 'A Father's Revenge', ''Seattle Times'', January 23, 1988 Page C-8&lt;/ref&gt; These three video poetry series aired frequently until 1992.

== An Alternative To Loud Boats ==
Members of Red Sky Poetry Theatre were instrumental in creating [[An Alternative To Loud Boats]],&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.seattlestar.net/2012/03/yeah-its-me-but-its-also-you-seattle-an-interview-with-emerald-citys-s-p-miskowski/ "Yeah, It's Me; But It's Also You, Seattle: An Interview with Emerald City's S.P.

Between  1988 and 1991, Alternative to Loud Boats was helped along by grants from the King County Arts Commission&lt;ref name="Alternative 8/4"/&gt; written by Cydney Gillis of  ''Arts Focus''. ''Arts Focus'' was a popular Seattle magazine dedicated to the Northwest literary and performance culture. Alternative to Loud Boats continued for ten years until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://splab.org/cascadia-poetry-advisory-board/ Cascadia Poetry Festival Advisory Board] accessed June 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical collaboration ==
Many musicians worked with Red Sky Poetry Theatre, including [[Wally Shoup]], who improvised saxophone on stage with poets and Michael Monhart, also a saxophonist.&lt;ref&gt;Donn Fry, [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910526&amp;slug=1285469 "Next Month Is Looking Very Bright"], ''Seattle Times'', May 26, 1991, accessed June 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Leinonen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.originalcast.com/peteleinonenband.htm Pete Leinonen], accessed May 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; recorded many of the Red Sky poets along with The Pete Leinonen Band.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J.

There are recordings of much of this work, as well as recordings of spoken word.

== Influence in Seattle ==
For all of the influence Red Sky Poetry Theatre had on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and national literary world, it was still considered "underground" by the academic establishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/pragmatic-literature/Content?oid=12703 "Pragmatic Literature The Rendezvous Reader Announces the Current Northwest Trend: Poetic Nonfiction"], ''The Stranger'' November 28, 2002 
	"Throughout the mid-'90s, the readings acted as a bridge between the UW and the Red Sky Poetry Theater--as a new place where readings were loud and raucous, yet serious.", Accessed June 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Stadler]] accessed May 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the controversial nature of many of the performers as Red Sky Poetry Theatre allowed anyone to openly state anything about the society within we live.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Svenvold, "Gypsy Cathedrals, Invisible Seattle, the Infrastructure of Poetry: Red Sky Poetry Theatre Remembered" (Paper presented for "Pacific Northwest Poetics" Panel Modern Language Association, Seattle, Washington, January 8, 2012)
	"There one found a poetic procedure fueled by an allegiance to performance and informed by a resistance to canonical Euro-centric influences. At Red Sky one found anthropology and alternative ways of viewing the universe. One found study of Neolithic cultures, of tribal cultures, of Native American cultures, of anything that spoke to an ancient "oral tradition." There was history aplenty at Red Sky"&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these performers would have no formal academic training. Not everyone liked this approach&lt;ref&gt;Jack Cady, A look at three artistic attempts, TV, poetry theater, and a writer, ''[[Peninsula Daily News]]'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; but it would prove to be paramount to the success of Red Sky Poetry Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Tom C.

[[Ira Cohen]], [[Sam Hamill]] and many other well known readers read at Red Sky Poetry Theatré. The list of influential or award winning poets who read at Red Sky Poetry Theatre is extensive.

While Red Sky Poetry Theatre was housed at the Ditto Tavern in the early 1990s, it had such an effect on the [[Belltown, Seattle|Belltown]] neighborhood that the local art magazine, ''Belltown's Brain Fever Dispatch'' would dedicate a full page to Red Sky Poetry Theatre for several months in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Baxter, ''Belltown's Brain Fever Dispatch, Vol. 2 # 6'' June 10, 1991 Page 14;

Red Sky would continue with board members leaving and new members joining. Peter Sawicki AKA Tobeimean Peter would join the board in 1985 bringing his artistic flare to the ''Open Sky'' magazine with his images on the cover. Peter left the following year to pursue his art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artslant.com/global/artists/show/154277-tobeimean-peter Peter Sawicki AKA Tobeimean Peter Bio], ''Art Slant'', accessed June 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Martina and Alan Goodin would leave in 1992 and Trudy Mercer, instrumental in the publication of early ''SkyViews'' and ''Open Sound'', would leave in 1994.

Thomas continued working closely with Red Sky Poetry Theatre until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070619165728/http://www.poetsencyclopedia.com/stephenthomas.shtml Stephen Thomas Bio], Poets Encyclopedia, accessed June 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Potter would join the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board in 1994 and stayed until the end.&lt;ref&gt;2012 -2014 Washington State Poet Laureate Kathleen Flenniken, [http://kathleenflenniken.com/blog/?tag=steve-potter Steve Potter, The Far Field], November 6, 2013, accessed June 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Hunter was an intrinsic member of the board, but left in 2004, the year before the last reading. Paul Nelson, who was also a DJ at [[KNKX|KPLU-FM]] and [[KNDD|KNDD-FM]] as well as other stations, would become a Red Sky Poetry Theatre board member in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Global Voices Radio, [http://globalvoicesradio.org/paul-nelson-resume.html Paul Everett Nelson, M.A., Resume], 2005, accessed June 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson was on the board at the end.

Others associated with the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board at this time were Diane Westergaard, who was on the board for a year starting in 2004, Allison Durazzi, also on the board, Belle Randall, a frequent featured reader,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Nelson, [http://www.thethepoetry.com/tag/red-sky-poetry-theater/ "Poetry and Poetics, Poetry Scenes: Seattle"], ''The The Poetry'', accessed June 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; David Lloyd Whited, whose book ''3 &amp; 1'' was published by Red Sky Press,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Upchurch, [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931003&amp;slug=1724226 "Some Titles From The Northwest Bookshelf"], ''Seattle Times'', October 3, 1993, accessed June 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and many others continued the Red Sky Poetry Theatre tradition of an unfettered open mic.

==Sunset ==
Don Wilsun, who according to Trudy Mercer was the 'Father of Red Sky Poetry Theatre', stayed on the board until 2001 although he started to participate much less after 1991.

The works of everyone affiliated with Red Sky Poetry Theatre or nine muses books is being archived at the University of Washington.&lt;ref name=UoW/&gt; Most of this growing body of works by various authors, musicians, and artists has not yet been digitized. (A History about Red Sky Poetry Theatre written for that collection, contains inaccuracies which are corrected in this document.)

Red Sky Poetry Theatre went through many venues after it left the Five-O Tavern in the late 1980s. It moved to the Cause Celebre Cafe, also on Capitol Hill, for a few months, then moved to the Still Life Cafe in Fremont, '[[The Center of the Universe]]'. It moved to Anna's Cafe briefly.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian G. Gaar, "Scratches" Builds Explosive Outburst,'' Arts Focus Volume 3 Number 4'', December 1988, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; From there Red Sky Poetry Theatre moved around but landed at Squid Row in the late 1980s. It showed in other venues, as well, moving in 1990 to the Ditto Tavern in Belltown, Seattle. Once the Ditto Tavern folded, Red Sky Poetry Theatre moved back up to Capitol Hill to the Globe Cafe. Robin Schultz, owner of the Globe Cafe, also published Poetry Around Press which published many Red Sky Poetry Theatre authors.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Schultz, ''Seattle Poems By Seattle Poets'', Poetry Around Press, https://books.google.com/books/about/Seattle_Poems_by_Seattle_Poets.html?id=3rQ4HAAACAAJ accessed June 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Globe changed hands and the last continuous Red Sky Poetry Theatre reading was on October 23, 2005.

Hundreds of poets, musicians, and performers appeared on Red Sky Poetry Theatre stages or in  Red Sky Poetry Theatre publications and productions so listing them all is unwieldy and unnecessary. Any Red Sky Poetry Theatre venue listed above can be found in a calendar listing somewhere and is likely mentioned in one of the cited articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1982">In philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Either/Or]]'', the '''rotation method''' is the mechanism used by higher level aesthetes in order to avoid [[boredom]]. The method is an essential [[hedonism|hedonistic]] aspect of the aesthetic way of life.

==Overview==
Kierkegaard likens the rotation method to the [[crop rotation]] used in [[agriculture]], in which the soil is constantly rotated in order to maximize the use of nutrients for the crops. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.

A consequence of the rotation method would be the aesthete's lack of commitment to any one thing. Commitment requires one to constantly repeat an activity; however, for the aesthetic, repeating an activity leads to boredom, as this activity is no longer novel.

The rotation method, Kierkegaard argues, would eventually lead aesthetes to a state of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], because all activities, no matter how unique or new, will eventually become boring:

:''I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding – the motion is too powerful; I don't feel like walking – it is too tiring; I don't feel like lying down, for either I have to stay down, and I don't feel like doing that or I would have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. ''Summa Summarum'': I don't feel like doing anything.'' – ''Either/Or'', p. 4&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Either/Or''. Princeton, 1985. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthete, Kierkegaard predicts, realizing and responding to the futility of one's hedonistic finite aims, will yearn to experience a more meaningful life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard''. Oneworld, 2003. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5574">'''Edgar Schneider's dynamic model''' of postcolonial Englishes adopts an evolutionary perspective emphasizing [[Ecolinguistics|language ecologies]]. It shows how language evolves as a process of 'competition-and-selection', and how certain linguistic features emerge. The Dynamic Model illustrates how the histories and ecologies will determine language structures in the different varieties of English, and how linguistic and [[Social identity|social identities]] are maintained.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Kirkpatrick, Andy (2007). ''World Englishes: implications for international communication and English language teaching''. Cambridge UP. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying principles ==
Five underlying principles underscore the Dynamic Model: &lt;ref name="textbk"&gt;Schneider, Edgar (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge UP. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The closer the [[Language contact|contact]], or higher the degree of [[bilingualism]] or [[multilingualism]] in a community, the stronger the effects of contact.
# The structural effects of language contact depends on social conditions. Therefore, history will play an important part.
# Contact-induced changes can be achieved by a variety of mechanisms, from [[code-switching]] to code alternation to [[language acquisition|acquisition strategies]].
# [[Language evolution]], and the emergence of contact-induced varieties, can be regarded as speakers making selections from a pool of linguistic variants made available to them.
# Which features will be ultimately adopted depends on the complete “ecology” of the contact situation, including factors such as demography, [[social relationships]], and surface similarities between languages etc.

The Dynamic Model outlines five major stages of the evolution of [[world Englishes]]. These stages will take into account the perspectives from the two major parties of agents – [[settlers]] (STL) and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous residents]] (IDG). Each phase is defined by four parameters:&lt;ref name="textbk" /&gt; 
# Extralinguistic factors (e.g. historical events)
# Characteristic [[Cultural identity|identity]] constructions for both parties
# [[Sociolinguistic]] determinants of [[language contact|contact]] setting
# Structural effects that emerge
&lt;br&gt;

In early 1947, Mahmassani founded a law firm in Beirut and became an attorney.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} That career continued until his death in 1986.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} During that period, Mahmassani was appointed to lead a number of international arbitrations, some in highly visible cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20692245?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102766952983 Arbitral tribunal: award in dispute between libyan american oil company (LIAMCO) and the government of the libyan arab republic relating to petroleum concessions] ''International Legal Materials'', Vol. 20(1), American Society of International Law, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biicl.org/files/3939_1977_liamco_v_libya.pdf Case summary: Libyan American Oil Company (LIAMCO) v The Libyan Arab Republic], in ''Damages in International Investment Law''. British Institute of International and Comparative Law, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public life and political career ==

The Mahmassani family is noted for its contributions to public life. On May 6, 1916 ([[Martyrs' Day (Lebanon and Syria)|Martyrs' Day]]), Sobhi's first cousins Mohammad and Mahmoud Mahmassani were publicly executed in what is now called [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut]] by [[Djemal Pasha|Jamal Pasha]], the Ottoman [[wāli]] of Greater Syria, because of their nationalist activities.

In 1944, Mahmassani was appointed as member of the Lebanese delegation to the founding of the [[Arab League]] in Alexandria, Egypt, in the capacity of legal advisor.

In 1945, he was appointed as member of the Lebanese delegation to the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|founding of the United Nations]] in San Francisco, USA, in the capacity of legal advisor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unalebanon.org/UNALebanon/aboutus.html United Nations Association of Lebanon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105142/http://www.unalebanon.org/UNALebanon/aboutus.html |date=2016-03-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His role was recognized in a 2013 exhibition at the [[American University of Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.aub.edu.lb/~webmgate/spring05/2.html Signs of Peace], ''Main Gate'', American University of Beirut, Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahmassani contributed to the modernization of Lebanese legislation and the creation of state institutions through his participation in the higher committee appointed for that purpose by President [[Fuad Chehab]] upon his election as President of the Republic in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0805MLN/08052502AGC.asp |title=Profiles of Lebanon's presidents since independence |publisher=Lebanonwire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120060845/http://lebanonwire.com/0805MLN/08052502AGC.asp |archivedate=2013-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Lebanese general election, 1964]], Mahmassani was elected to a four-year term as member of the Lebanese Parliament representing the capital city Beirut.  He did not seek re-election.

In 1966, he was appointed minister of national economy in the Lebanese government presided by [[Abdallah El-Yafi]], a position he occupied until 1968.

== Academic career ==

In parallel with his professional legal and political careers, Mahmassani had an academic career that spanned from the late 1930s to the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He joined the faculty of the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1936 and continued until 1964; over which period he taught several courses, namely Roman law, the laws of the Arab countries and Islamic law.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Around the same time, Mahmassani also joined the faculty of the law school of [[Saint Joseph University]] in Beirut where he taught the comparative legal systems of the Arab countries.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani was a founder of the [[Lebanese University]] and its law school in the early 1960s; he was thus among its first professors teaching Islamic law.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani also joined the faculty of the law school of the [[Beirut Arab University]] when it opened its doors in Beirut.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Finally, Mahmassani taught law courses at the Military Academy in Lebanon. During a certain period, Mahmassani was lecturing at five universities.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

As part of his academic career, Mahmassani visited a number of countries to give lectures as a visiting professor (such as in the US, the Netherlands, Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Tunisia) or as participant in international conferences (such as in the US, France, Italy, Egypt, Iraq). In particular, in the summer of 1966, he gave a series of lectures at the [[Hague Academy of International Law]] on International law and relations in Islam.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He was elected as a Member of the Arab Academies of Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

As a scholar of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Mahmassani was noted for being open-minded towards other cultures and faiths, and is frequently quoted in discussions of ''Liberal Islam''.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, C. [http://www.liberalinstitute.com/LiberalIslam.html Liberal Islam: Prospects and Challenges] The Liberal Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abou El Fadl, K.

''American University International Law Review'' 12(1), 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He actively participated in international conferences on cultural exchanges and inter-faith dialogue. Most notable were his participation in the [[UNESCO]] conferences in Florence, Italy (1950) and Paris, France (1953); the Colloquium on Islamic Culture in Princeton, US (September 1953);&lt;ref&gt;''Colloquium on Islamic Culture in its Relation to the Contemporary World''. Princeton University Press, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; the conferences on Muslim - Christian cooperation in Tehran, Iran (1957) and Bhamdoun, Lebanon (1954).

Citations to his work appear in many scholarly books and articles on Islamic law, e.g. ''Shari_a: Islamic Law in the Contemporary Context'',&lt;ref&gt;Opwis, F. Law and Legal Change: The Concept of Maslaha in Classical and Contemporary Islamic Legal Theory. Chapter 4 in Amanat, A. and Griffel, F. (eds.)

''An Introduction to Islamic Law'', 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, 1966. (Mahmassani is cited in the bibliographies of Chapters 1,15,17 and 20).&lt;/ref&gt;  His work on the legal aspects of human rights, from the perspective of different legal systems, is a source for scholars of international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, A.-E. ''Islam and Human Rights: Tradition and Politics''. Westview Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saeed, A. and Saeed, H. ''Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam''. Ashgate, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a review, published in the ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', of the first English translation of Mahmassani’s classic reference ''Falsafat Al-Tashri' Fi Al-Islām, The Philosophy of Jurisprudence in Islam'' (translated into English by Farhat Ziadeh),  Anderson refers to Mahmassani as a "leading Lebanese lawyer of the modern school", stating "Professor Mahmassani has … a wide knowledge both of European and Islamic law; he has provided a number of admirable examples of such phenomena as changes in the law authored by early Caliphs or approved by classical jurists; his statements are well-documented; and his remarks…-and indeed most of his summary of the law of evidence are admirable."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.N.D. Review of S. Mahmassani: ''Falsafat Al-Tashri' Fi Al-Islām, The Philosophy of Jurisprudence in Islam. Translated into English by Farhat J. Ziadeh.'' xii, 217 pp. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1961.

A number of honours have been awarded to Mahmassani in Lebanon and abroad in recognition of his contributions.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}  Upon his passing in 1986, he was posthumously awarded the [[National Order of the Cedar]] by the President of Lebanon.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Several obituaries and testimonials highlighting Mahmassani's influence as a legal scholar have appeared in Arabic publications; an English language biographical note appears in the ''Middle East Commercial Law Review''.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh, N. Biographical Notes on the Late Mahmassani. ''Middle East Commercial Law Review'' 2(6), 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 25th Anniversary obituary was published (in Arabic) in the ''[[Al Liwaa]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aliwaa.com/Article.aspx?ArticleId=123138 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105091805/http://www.aliwaa.com/Article.aspx?ArticleId=123138 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-11-05 |title=حافظ تراث الإسلام وتراث لبنان وتراث بيروت |publisher=Aliwaa.com |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{seealso|South Street (Philadelphia)}}Originally the southern border of William Penn's 1682 city plan and officially named Cedar Street until 1854&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/philadelphia/formerstreets.htm|title=Philadelphia History: Old Street Names.|website=www.ushistory.org|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eastern South Street has been the center of local Swedish, Dutch, Jewish, Irish, and Italian immigrant culture as well as a vibrant [[African-American neighborhood]] beginning in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/south-street/|title=South Street {{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Quaker doctrine opposed live performances within the city limits, the first permanent theater in America was built on the south side of the street at Leithgow Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hiddencityphila.org/2012/01/hippest-street-in-town-circa-1766/|title=Hippest Street In Town, Circa 1766 {{!}} Hidden City Philadelphia|website=hiddencityphila.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, giving birth to a tradition of Philadelphians seeking out entertainment on South Street that continues today.

In 1854, the same year that South Street officially became South Street, the city boundaries were redrawn to expand the area of Philadelphia to 130 square miles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/consolidation-act-of-1854/|title=Consolidation Act of 1854 {{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite no longer being a literal border, South Street remained a liminal space where cultures collided. The African-American theater district of western South Street, the Jewish shops, nearby Italian businesses, and visitors from other parts of the city combined to create a place described by [[William Gardner Smith]] in his 1954 book ''South Street'' as a lively zone of contact between many different ethnicities. [[File:NW Corner South St and Front Philly.JPG|220px|right|thumb|Corner of South and Front]]
From the early 1960s to the 1970s, South Street was filled with clubs and bars that fostered a growing nightlife. During this time, the neighborhood also served as an artists' haven and a hub of [[Beat Generation|Beat subculture]] and, later, [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], [[bohemianism]], and the [[hippie movement]] in Philadelphia, establishing a lasting association of South Street with [[avant-garde]] and [[alternative culture|alternative subcultures]].&lt;ref name="icons"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6Iii1MNkXoC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDyuqXqu7LAhXIZCYKHXmWB2A4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false|title=Philadelphia Icons: 50 Classic Views of the City of Brotherly Love|last1=Ivory|first1=Karen|date=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frommers"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WR5OAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=south+street+philadelphia+artists+bohemian&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+artists+bohemian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbyJLarO7LAhWEMSYKHecyDf8Q6AEIOzAF|title=Frommer's Philadelphia &amp; the Amish Country|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lauren|date=2009|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keech"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beMxAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=The Best Flea, Antique, Vintage, and New-Style Markets in America|last1=Keech|first1=Pamela|date=2013|publisher=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASTKVQDpbYYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=Blinded by the Lyrics: Behind the Lines of Rock and Roll's Most Baffling Songs|last1=Mann|first1=Brett|date=2005|publisher=Citadel Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMHcDciM3kMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIUTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=Black Citymakers: How The Philadelphia Negro Changed Urban America|last1=Hunter|first1=Marcus Anthony|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was not uncommon for South Philadelphians to "[[bar hopping|bar-hop]]" across the clubs, listening to live bands along the way. This community of fans helped attract recording contracts for many artists, including [[Kenn Kweder]], the "bard of South Street"; [[George Thorogood]]; and [[Robert Hazard]]. From the mid to late 1970s into the 1980s, South Street's reputation as a musical, artistic, and [[countercultural]] hub was further solidified as it became the center of Philadelphia's [[punk scene]] and [[punk rock|punk]] and [[alternative rock]] music communities, with venues such as JC Dobbs and stores such as Zipperhead catering to the burgeoning scene.&lt;ref name="amorosi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amorosi|first1=A.D.|title=Where They Were Then|url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2002-10-17/cover3.shtml|website=Philadelphia City Paper|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laird"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laird|first1=R.F.|title=The Boomer Bible|date=1991|publisher=Workman Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-IT-INLWzkC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTp4n1qO7LAhUDQyYKHXGeArwQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ivory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivory|first1=Karen|title=Philadelphia Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places|date=2007|publisher=Globe Pequot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7VhpHPjcscC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTp4n1qO7LAhUDQyYKHXGeArwQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, [[Jim's Steaks]] of [[West Philadelphia]]  expanded to 400 South Street, becoming the notable restaurant's first franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimssteaks.com/jim-s-steaks--history.html|title=Jim's Steaks History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, South Street became one of the city's main tourist attractions anchored by the [[Theatre of Living Arts]] (TLA) which began as an [[Art film|arthouse]] theater and then was reborn as a live music venue. Tourists flocked to the South Street's nightlife and the "neighborhood" community aspect was gradually lost.

South Street remains a popular hangout area for teens, college students, and [[twentysomething (term)|twentysomethings]] with its assortment of bars, [[take-out]] eateries, [[sex shop]]s, gift shops, and retailers catering to [[hip hop fashion]], [[punk fashion]], and/or [[urban culture]].  A few restaurants and independent [[boutique]]s targeting a slightly more mature clientele are interspersed with these businesses, such as Accent on Animals, a pet supply store, and South Street Souvlaki, a Greek restaurant. Starting in the late 1990s, the street saw the establishment of various [[chain store]]s, including [[Johnny Rockets]], two [[Starbucks]] locations, [[Häagen-Dazs]], [[Rita's Italian Ice]], [[Super Fresh]], [[Whole Foods]], [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]], and [[Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board|Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits]].  South Street is adjacent to [[Headhouse Square]], a notable plaza with various shops and restaurants.

Artist [[Isaiah Zagar]] has made South Street his home since the late 1960s and his mosaic work can be seen in multiple places along South Street including his large installation [[Philadelphia's Magic Gardens]] between 10th Street and 11th Street.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Zipperhead south street philly.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Zipperhead (now relocated and changed name) was mentioned in the song "Punk Rock Girl" by the [[Dead Milkmen]].]]
[[The Orlons]], a music group from Philadelphia, released a 1963 song based on (and entitled) South Street, which begins with the line "Where do all the hippies meet?"  Another Philadelphia-area band, [[The Dovells]] also mentioned South Street in their 1963 hit "[[You Can't Sit Down]]".

Philadelphia band [[Need New Body]] has a song called "So St RX" which is about South Street.

[[Fear (band)|Fear]]'s 1982 song "[[The Record (album)|I Don't Care About You]]", which name-checks the neighborhoods associated with the punk movement in the United States in the early 1980s, begins with the line, "I'm from South Street Philadelphia" (also relevant to writer/vocalist [[Lee Ving]] who was born in the city).

[[The Dead Milkmen]]'s 1988 song "Punk Rock Girl" makes references to Zipperhead (a punk rock/alternative clothing and accessories store) and The Philadelphia Pizza Company., Ltd, both of which were located on South Street. Portions of the video for this song were filmed on South Street. Zipperhead has since relocated to South 4th St. and been renamed to Crash Bang Boom. A few years after Zipperhead founder and building landlord Rick Millan sold the business to local musician Rob Windfelder of the rock band Live Not On Evil and his business partner Stefanie Jollis, the store was relocated and renamed.

[[Green Day]] made their Philadelphia debut on January 23, 1993 at J.C. Dobbs on the 300 block of South Street. The band had not yet signed with Reprise and the club oversold the 125-capacity venue. Late arrivals paid to enter the second floor and watch the live video feed. During the third song of the set, a young woman had a seizure, the show was halted, and police ended the concert and cleared the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pearn Jr.|first=Frank |date=January 23, 1993|title=Philadelphia Police Seize The Moment At Dobbs |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1993-01-23/entertainment/2906403_1_green-day-dobbs-punk-rock|newspaper=The Morning Call|location=Allentown|publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boyz II Men]]'s debut song and video "[[Motownphilly]]" was partially filmed on South Street and the location is referenced in the song.

Singer songwriter Jake Laufer's 2009 rockabilly song, "Center City," about a guy from Tennessee coming north to meet up with his Philly-based girlfriend, features several South Street landmarks, including Lorenzo's Pizza and Famous 4th Street Deli.

[[File:WTP C20 AMP 1.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The Theater of the Living Arts]]
The [[Home Box Office|HBO]] comedy special ''[[The Diceman Cometh]]'', starring comedian [[Andrew Dice Clay]], was recorded at South Street's [[Theater of the Living Arts]] (and was mentioned in the special by Clay).

The block of South Street between 5th and 6th Street is shown in the opening credits of the FX Network show "[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]".

Philadelphia native [[Will Smith]] makes mention in his song "Getting Jiggy with it" in the lyric "livin' that life some consider a myth,
rock from south street to one two fifth".

==Education==
South Street is served by the [[William M. Meredith School]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5879">{{italic title}}'''''The History of Cities and Villages of the Ukrainian SSR''''' ({{lang-uk|Історія міст і сіл Української РСР}}) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] encyclopedia, published in 26 volumes. It provides knowledge about the history of all [[populated places in Ukraine]].

It was approved by the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] in 1962 and published for the first time the very same year. The chief editor was the noted scholar and historian [[Petro Tronko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbuv.gov.ua/people/tronko.html|script-title=uk:Тронько Петро Тимофійович|publisher=NBUV|accessdate=September 11, 2010|language=Ukrainian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820081620/http://www.nbuv.gov.ua/people/tronko.html|archivedate=August 20, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the first thorough historical work of its kind. Each volume covered the history of all populated places in different regions of Ukraine, and at that time they numbered almost 40,000. The encyclopedia played an important role in collecting materials for writing essays about the villages. The encyclopedia was compiled by the [[State Historical Library of Ukraine]] together with the [[NASU Institute of History of Ukraine]] (part of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]], NASU). The publication of ''History of towns and villages of the Ukrainian SSR'' was also published in Russian.

There were published 26 volumes of the encyclopedia (one for each region of Ukraine). In addition, there are also 10 more volumes were published separately in the [[Russian language]].

'''''The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective''''' is a book by Old Testament scholar [[Terence E. Fretheim]].  In 1984 it appeared as number 14 in the Overtures to Biblical Theology series published by [[Fortress Press]].

== Summary and review ==

Most Christians believe the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] of God is an exclusively [[New Testament]] idea, but in ''The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective'', Terence E. Fretheim argues that incarnation has always been God's standard method of interaction with humanity.  Through exegesis and a [[Literary criticism|literary]] and philosophical [[Hermeneutics|approach to Scripture]], Fretheim draws the elusive [[Yahweh|God of the Old Testament]] close.  Indeed, the author seeks to balance the common images of God as wrathful [[Last Judgment|judge]] or cold [[Divine law|lawgiver]] with an image of God in relationship with humanity.  According to Fretheim, God suffers because He has completely and intimately bound Himself in relation to the created world, especially [[Chosen people|His people Israel]].

Fretheim defends his thesis by claiming that "[[metaphor]]s matter" and appealing to biblical images of an [[Immanence|immanent deity]].   For him, the most significant metaphors for God in the Old Testament are [[anthropomorphic]].  If man is created in the [[image of God]], he argues, then we have "permission to reverse the process and, by looking at the human, learn what God is like" (p.&amp;nbsp;11).  The human metaphor is presented as the dominant expression of God's nature and character.  The author says that many aspects of humanity are not appropriate for describing God.  [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]], [[death]], [[sinfulness]], etc. are aspects of human nature that should not be ascribed to God.  These "ungodly" aspects of humanity have moved some Christians to dismiss anthropomorphic descriptions of God out of hand, but Fretheim argues that the human metaphor is so pervasive and appropriate that it acts as a sort of guide, directing the reader as to the proper way to understand all non-human metaphors.

The human metaphor has been long neglected in Fretheim's opinion, but he sees [[feminist theology]], [[Liberation theology|liberation]] / [[Black theology]], and the [[Holocaust theology|theological response to catastrophic events]] of the twentieth century as positive responses to this neglect.  The problem, he says, is that too many theologians are doing their own exegesis, and they are bringing ideas to the text which cannot be supported.  He argues that [[Biblical studies|biblical scholars]], biased by their theology, have largely ignored texts concerning God's [[repentance]], downplayed anthropomorphic descriptions of God, and misunderstood issues relating to [[divine foreknowledge]].  Fretheim believes that an unbiased view will be more pluralistic and more willing to incorporate the relational aspects of the Old Testament God.

=== Summary ===

The first traditional view that Fretheim seeks to undermine, or perhaps more accurately to bring balance to, is the idea of [[divine transcendence]].  He argues that both the monarchical and organismic views are present in scripture, but that the organismic, [[Immanence|immanent]] image is dominant.  This “relationship of reciprocity” (p.&amp;nbsp;35) between God and the world is the foundation for all of Fretheim's conclusions.   God affects and is affected by the world He has created, and this relationship is key to understanding what kind of God He is.

The second widely held position that Fretheim challenges is the doctrine of divine [[omniscience]]. (chapter 4) Fretheim uses solid biblical exegesis to argue compellingly against a view (at least in the Old Testament) which classifies omniscience as one of God's fundamental characteristics. Divine foreknowledge, he believes, is limited because of God's relationship with creation.  There is no doubt, he says, that God always knows what He will do in the future, but He does not always know what free moral agents outside of Himself will do.  For Fretheim, the widespread use of  words like “perhaps” and “if” in divine speech point to a lack of certainty in God's mind about the future.  God's bargain with Abraham over Sodom is an excellent example of God's mind being open to change depending on the unforeseen actions of human beings.  The issue of foreknowledge is not presented as complex or difficult.  Rather, Fretheim quickly lays out his argument and in less than fifteen pages and moves on to the addresses the issue of [[Divine presence|God's presence]] in the world. (chapter 5) While acknowledging that God is everywhere at all times in a structural or general presence, Fretheim describes what he calls, the “intensification of the divine presence.”  This intensity of presence can be affected positively or negatively by human beings.  Fretheim argues that [[sin]] drives away God (as in Ezekiel 8:6) and actually results in the intensification of divine presence in the form of [[Divine wrath|God's wrath]].  Conversely, [[righteousness]] or “[[receptiveness]]” can move God to draw near.

The most intense experience of God's presence occurs in the form of [[theophany]].  In what is probably Fretheim's most controversial chapter (chapter 6), he describes the appearances of God in the Old Testament and the human reaction to them.  To Fretheim, the spoken word delivered by God is no more important than the appearance itself, the visible word, as he calls it.  He suggests that modern theologians need to broaden their understanding of the Word of God to include the visual aspects of revelation as well as the spoken/written word.
Fretheim makes a thorough examination of several different Old Testament theophanies noting their similarities and differences before coming to his surprising conclusion:  All theophanies involve God taking on human form (chapter 6).  Theologically, this is key for Fretheim.  The consistent use of human form shows God's [[vulnerability]].  It proves that there is nothing fundamentally ungodly about the human form, and it shows that “the finite form is capable of the infinite.” (p.&amp;nbsp;102)  In wrestling with the theological implications of such a statement, Fretheim questions whether God uses the human form for the sake of appearances or whether there is a fundamental continuity between the two.  Not surprisingly, he argues for the latter position, and from the argument establishes that God is fundamentally connected to His creation and that He is fundamentally vulnerable because of this relationship.  This leads to his actual discussion of the suffering of God.

In three short chapters Fretheim describes God as suffering because of His creation (chapter 7), for His creation (chapter 8), and with His creation (chapter 9) .  These chapters flow logically out of the groundwork established in the first one hundred pages of the text.  Each chapter is neatly summarized in numbered points making it easy to review and synthesize.
The final chapter of Fretheim's book deals with the special relationship between the suffering God and His suffering servants, [[the prophets]].  In men like [[Jeremiah]], the [[Logos (Christianity)|divine word]] is incarnated to the point that the prophet shares in the divine suffering and God shares in the prophets suffering. The lives of the prophets are tied up in the [[Affective Theology|divine life]] to the point that they embody the word of God in their lives as well as their words.  The [[suffering servant]] in Isaiah experiences the same phenomenon as prophets like [[Moses]] and Jeremiah, but in him, Fretheim sees another level intensification of presence.  Despite his strong claims about the shared suffering of the prophets and God, Fretheim acknowledges that in the Old Testament God Himself did not become completely incarnate in an entire human life.  That act is reserved for the [[incarnation of Jesus Christ]], but Fretheim sees it, not as something radically new, but as “the culmination of a long-standing relationship of God with the world that is much more widespread in the OT than is commonly recognized.”

Fretheim's work is incredibly successful at accomplishing its stated purpose of bringing balance to the church's image of God in the Old Testament.  He powerfully synthesizes the work of feminist, liberation, and [[process theologian]]s while relying firmly on his expertise as a biblical exegete.   The real strength of this work is that Fretheim manages to make many of the same critiques common to these movements without sounding like a feminist or a liberation theologian.  While he acknowledges their influence on him, the author's tone and focus remain overtly biblical throughout the book.

Fretheim brings an air of authority and experience in the task of exegesis that is missing in the works of [[systematic theologian]]s addressing the same issues.   Influences like [[Abraham Heschel]] help him keep Christian bias to a minimum when approaching the Old Testament text.   Furthermore, he does not limit himself to one or two proof texts to support his position.  On the contrary, I found myself flipping through my Bible constantly while reading his work.  He challenges the reader to draw theology from the biblical text rather than to allow our preconceived ideas about God to distort our reading of the Old Testament.
Fretheim's book is a marvelous example of [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] logical organization and rational approach to a complex topic.  His argument is well-formed and easy to follow.  The reader may be confused as to why a book called ''The Suffering of God'' takes over one hundred pages to actually discuss any pain endured by the deity, but Fretheim is not rushed into embracing a position before laying the biblical and philosophical groundwork necessary to support that position.   Indeed, laying the foundation is the difficult part.  After chapter six, the reader already anticipates the conclusion.

The author is conversant with a wide range of modern scholarship as evidenced by his excellent endnotes and bibliography.   The relative brevity of the book is amazing considering the wide range of topics addressed.  Here again, Fretheim's organizational skills are at work.  When a related but unessential issue arises, he usually adds a note to refer the reader to good sources on the topic and continues on without interrupting his argument.
One of the nicest things about this work is its energetic and engaging style.  Fretheim hopes this book will change the church's view of God in the Old Testament, and readability is essential to influencing preachers and teachers within churches.  The provocative nature of the topic and Fretheim's willingness to make bold claims leads the reader into dialogue with the text.  Ward characterizes it as “bold and challenging, inviting vigorous response,” saying that the margins of his review copy are “filled with comments”   While the content is too technical for direct use in most [[church congregation|church settings]], the ideas that Fretheim lays out can easily be transferred to a [[sermon]] or [[Sunday School|Bible class]].  Certainly, The Suffering of God is not a popular level book, but it is also not so technical as to exclude ministers or [[seminary]] students from its audience.

=== Critiques ===
While reviews have been very positive, they have raised three serious critiques of the work.  First, in his effort to emphasize the imminent and relational nature of God, Fretheim neglects to adequately address themes like [[holy|holiness]] as a balance to his relational theology.  Without the tension provided by God's holiness, relational theology can be pushed too far, and Fretheim sometimes is guilty of this.   [[Dale Patrick]] points out that while Fretheim does not deny that much of the God-talk in the Old Testament does fit into the traditional paradigms which emphasize holiness, [[sovereignty]], and transcendence he ignores these elements claiming that the organismic is predominant.  Patrick argues that the task of biblical theology is to present a comprehensive image of God rather than simply a prominent one.   Some have claimed that Fretheim's process theology (a term Fretheim himself never embraces) is to blame for the lack of material on holiness.   However, given Fretheim's presupposition that transcendence and sovereignty have been overemphasized, it is easy to see why he doesn’t spend time affirming them.  His stated goal is not to replace ideas of holiness, but to bring balance to them.
As previously stated, Fretheim uses a wide variety of texts to support his position, but the vast majority of these come from the [[Psalms]] and the prophetic literature.  As Elizabeth Bellefontaine notes, Israel's [[wisdom literature|wisdom traditions]] are conspicuously absent.   Despite his heavy criticism of those who “remove certain materials from the OT theological repertoire” for the purposes of theological convergence (p.&amp;nbsp;20), Fretheim himself offers a nod to the [[wisdom literature]] and then completely ignores it.  This would be less relevant were it not for the fact that much of the wisdom literature stands in tension if not opposition to his own theology.

While Fretheim's catch phrase, “Metaphors matter,” can be universally affirmed, he is sometimes guilty of thinking that they matter too much.  This leads him at time to engage in an overly literal reading of scripture.  Metaphors reveal God to us, but they are not God himself.  “The modern interpreter’s challenge, which is not adequately confronted in this book, is to discern how the Old Testament understood its metaphors.”    He overstates his case when discussing incarnational metaphor and [[theodicy]].   White says, “There is no need for Fretheim to argue (as he does) that all theophanies were in human form in order to substantiate the interrelationship between theophanic motif and the prophet.” Saying that a human figure can be inferred within the [[pillar of cloud]] or the [[burning bush]] (p.&amp;nbsp;94–95) is speculative at best, and Fretheim doesn’t need it to advance his argument.

'''Theodor Anton Max Ippen''' (November 29, 1861 – January 31, 1935) was an [[Albanology|Albanologist]] and [[diplomat]] from [[Austria-Hungary]]. Ippen belonged to the group of Albanologists who published their works on Albania through the state-financed institutes of Austria-Hungary in order to create the Albanian national consciousness which he believed would be beneficial for Dual Monarchy. Ippen supported the establishment of an independent nation-state of Albanians. He served as diplomat in [[Shkoder]], [[Pljevlja]], [[Istanbul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Athens]] and [[London]] where he advised ambassador of Austria-Hungary during [[London Conference of 1912–1913|London Conference]] which ended with signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|London treaty]] and a decision to establish the [[Principality of Albania]] reached on 29 July 1913. During the period between 1921 and 1927, he was a member of the [[Commissions of the Danube River|International Danube Commission]].

It was Ippen who asserted that [[Skanderbeg]] was buried within the fortifications of [[Lezhë]]. His opinion was based on the work of [[Marin Barleti|Barletius]] who wrote that Skanderbeg was buried in the Church of St. Nicholas, without explanation if the church's building was inside or outside the castle. Ippen assumed that such notable person like Skanderbeg would have been buried in the best place of the city, in its castle. He also speculated that the [[Ottomans]] transformed this church into a [[mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Deuxième Conférence des études albanologiques | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=2FXhULT8BpDE4gSVtIGABQ&amp;id=t0PRAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Celui+qui+a+voulu+prouver+pourquoi+la+s%C3%A9pulture+du+h%C3%A9ros+devait+%C3%AAtre+cherch%C3%A9e+%C3%A0+l%27int%C3%A9rieur+du+mur+de+ceinture+du+ch%C3%A2teau+fort+a+%C3%A9t%C3%A9+Th.+Ippen.+On+sait+de+l%27histoire+de+Barletius%2C+soutient+Ippen%2C+que+Skanderbeg+a+%C3%A9t%C3%A9+enseveli+dans+l%27%C3%A9glise+de&amp;q=%22Celui+qui+a+voulu+prouver+pourquoi+la+s%C3%A9pulture+du+h%C3%A9ros+devait+%C3%AAtre+cherch%C3%A9e+%C3%A0+l%27int%C3%A9rieur+du+mur+de+ceinture+du+ch%C3%A2teau+fort+a+%C3%A9t%C3%A9+Th.+Ippen.+On+sait+de+l%27histoire+de+Barletius%2C+soutient+Ippen%2C+que+Skanderbeg+a+%C3%A9t%C3%A9+enseveli+dans+l%27%C3%A9glise+de%22#search_anchor | publisher=Université d'état de Tirana, Institut d'histoire et de linguistique | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | year=1969 | conference=Deuxième Conférence des études albanologiques: à l'occasion du 5e centenaire de la mort de Georges Kastriote-Skanderbeg | location=Tirana | page=298 | quote=Celui qui a voulu prouver pourquoi la sépulture du héros devait être cherchée à l'intérieur du mur de ceinture du château fort a été Th.

D'autre part, Ippen  exprime l'opinion qu'un haute personnalité, comme l'était Skanderbeg, doit avoir été inhumé dans la meilleure place de la ville, c'est-à-dire dans son château. De même, en partant du fait que ce château doit avoir eu en ces temps-là un temple chrétien, Ippen ajoute qu'il ne serait pas superflu de conjecturer que l'église de Saint-Nicolas, c'est-à-dire le lieu de sépulture de Skanderbeg, doive se trouver dans le château fort de Lesh, et précisément dans les ruines de sa mosquée qui peut avoir été construite sur les fondations de quelque église préturque.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ippen's estimations around 20,000 Albanians fled parts of Ottoman Empire captured by Serbia during Serbian-Ottoman War (1877-1878).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Kosovsko-metohijski zbornik | publisher=Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti | author=Isaković, Antonije| authorlink= Antonije Isaković| year=1990 | location=Belgrade | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKAMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BD+%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0&amp;dq=%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BD+%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lADgUPrFNoKYtQbK5ICgAw&amp;redir_esc=y | quote=(Ипен наводи да je двадесет хшьада арбанашких исел&gt;еника-мухацира отишло из ослобог)ених Kpajena Cpônje у рату са Турском 1877/78. године}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vladimir Nazor Award''' ({{lang-hr|Nagrada Vladimir Nazor}}) is an annual award given by the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Culture]] to Croatian artists for highest achievements in various artistic fields. It was established in 1959 and is named for poet [[Vladimir Nazor]]. {{As of|2016}}, the award is given in the following six categories:

*[[Architecture]] and [[urbanism]]
*[[Film]]
*[[Literature]]
*[[Music]]
*[[Theatre]]
*[[Visual arts]] and [[applied arts]]

Two awards are given in each category every year - a life achievement award (for overall contributions to their respective field) and an annual award (for notable works in the field in the past twelve months). The winners for the preceding year are announced every year on 19 June, the anniversary of Nazor's death.

==List of Life Achievement Award winners==
Awards marked with † denote shared wins.
