{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}
An '''interpretation''' in [[philosophy of art]], is an [[explanation]] of the meaning of some [[work of art]]. An '''aesthetic interpretation''' expresses a particular emotional or experiential [[understanding]] most often used in reference to a poem, or piece of literature, and may also apply to a work of visual art, or performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://generaleducation.fas.harvard.edu/aesthetic-interpretive-understanding|title=Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims of interpretation==
Readers may approach reading a text from different starting points. A student assigned to interpret a poem for class comes at reading differently from someone on the beach reading a novel for escapist pleasure. "Interpretation" implies the conscious task of making sense out of a piece of writing that may not be clear at first glance or that may reward deeper reading even if it at first appears perfectly clear. The beach reader will probably not need to interpret what she or he reads, but the student will.  Professor [[Louise Rosenblatt]], a specialist in the study of the reading process, distinguished between two reading ''stances'' that occupy opposite ends of a spectrum. ''Aesthetic reading'' differs from ''efferent reading'' in that the former describes a reader coming to the text expecting to devote attention to the words themselves, to take pleasure in their sounds, images, connotations, etc. ''Efferent reading'', on the other hand, describes someone, "reading for knowledge, for information, or for the conclusion to an argument, or maybe for directions as to action, as in a recipe..., reading for what [one is] going to carry away afterwards. I term this efferent reading."(L. Rosenblat) That is what ''efferent'' means, leading or conducting away from something, in this case information from a text. On this view, poems and stories do not offer the reader a message to carry away, but a pleasure in which to participate actively—aesthetically.

== One or many ==
There are many different theories of interpretation. On the one hand, there may be innumerable interpretations for any given piece of art, any one of which may be considered valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/If-art-can-be-interpreted-in-any-way-that-you-want-doesnt-that-make-art-meaningless?ref=rss#!n=36|title=Art can be interpreted in any way that you want|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may also be claimed that there really is only one valid interpretation for any given piece of art. The aesthetic theory that says people may approach art with different but equally valid aims is called "pluralism." But the aim of some of interpretations is such that they claim to be true or false. 

A "relativistic" kind of claim - between "All readings are equally good" and "Only one reading is correct" - holds that readings that tie together more details of the text and that gain approval of practiced readers are better than ones that do not. One kind of relativistic interpretation is called "formal," referring to the "form" or shape of patterns in the words of a text, especially a poem or song. Pointing to the rhymes at the ends of lines is an objective set of resemblances in a poem. A reader of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=The Raven}}&lt;/ref&gt; cannot help but hear the repetition of "nevermore" as a formal element of Poe's poem. Less obvious and a bit subjective would be an interpreter's pointing to the resemblance tying together all the mentions of weariness, napping, dreaming, and the drug [[nepenthe]].

In the early 20th Century the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] explored questions of formal philosophical analysis verses personal interpretations of aesthetic experience, preferencing the direct subjective experience of a work of art as essential to an individual's aesthetic interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger-aesthetics/#SymSub|title=Heideggar Aesthetics|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary theory informed by awareness that an ever-expanding exposure to ideas made possible by the internet has changed both the act of creation, and the experience of perception, is known as ''Multi Factorial Apperception'' (MFA). This approach seeks to integrate a wide range of cultural variables to expand the contextual frame for viewing the creation, and perception, of aesthetic experience. Emphasis is on a dynamic mulit-layerd cultural framing of the act of creation at a particular moment in time, and admits that the meaning of a particular work will be in flux from that moment onward.[citation needed]

== Intended interpretation ==
Some students of the reading process advocate that a reader should attempt to identify what the artist is trying to accomplish and interpret the art in terms of whether or not the artist has succeeded. Professor [[E. D. Hirsch]] wrote two books arguing that "the author's intention must be the ultimate determiner of meaning." (E. D. Hirsch) In this controversial view, there is a single correct interpretation consistent with the artist's intention for any given art work.

The phrase '''anthropic units''' (from Greek ''anthropos'' meaning [hu]man) is used with different meanings in [[archaeology]], in [[measurement|mensuration]] and in [[social studies]].

==In archaeology==
In archaeology anthropic units are strata or deposits of material containing a high proportion of man-made detritus. For example:&lt;ref name=vidale&gt;Massimo Vidale (1990). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29756938 Study of the Moneer South East Area A Complex Industrial Site of Moenjodaro]. ''East and West''. Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente (IsIAO). '''40'''(1/4): 301-314. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"… 'degraded anthropic units', i.e., deposits produced by weathering and decay of fired bricks and mixed fill with non-selected inclusions …"|Massimo Vidale (1990)}}

==In mensuration==
Following the coinage of the term "[[anthropic principle]]" by [[Brandon Carter]] in 1973–4,&lt;ref name=carter&gt;Brandon Carter (1974). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1974IAUS...63..291C Large number coincidences and the anthropic principle in cosmology]. ''Confrontation of cosmological theories with observational data; Proceedings of the Symposium, Krakow, Poland, September 10–12, 1973.'' Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing. pp. 291-298.&lt;/ref&gt; units of measurement that are on a human scale are occasionally referred to as "anthropic units", as for example here:&lt;ref name=petley&gt;Brian William Petley (1985). ''The fundamental physical constants and the frontier of measurement''. Bristol; Boston: A. Hilger. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"… the metre and kilogram occupy a reasonably central position as far as symmetry in positive and negative powers of ten is concerned, emphasising that the SI units are natural anthropic units …"|Brian William Petley (1985)}}

==In social studies==
In fields of study such as sociology and ethnography, anthropic units are identifiable groupings of people. For example:&lt;ref name=thomson&gt;J. J. Thomson (1896). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1625562 Address by the President to the Mathematical and Physical Section]. ''Science''. American Association for the Advancement of Science. New Series, '''4'''(90): 392-402. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"Ethnographers have been accustomed to deal with the 'race', the 'tribe' and the 'nation' as social or anthropic units …"|J. J. Thomson (1896)}}
and:&lt;ref name=kantor&gt;Jacob Robert Kantor (1944 [1929]). ''An outline of social psychology''. Ann Arbor, Michigan: Edwards Brothers. p. 120. Accessed June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|"... among the more primitive anthropic units it seems a grave ineptitude for the Chukchees not to adopt the snowhouse building complex from the neighboring Eskimos"|Jacob Robert Kantor (1944)}}

The '''Brokpa language''' ({{lang-dz |དྲོག་པ་ཁ།, དྲོགཔ་ཁ།}}, ''Dr˚okpakha'', ''Dr˚opkha''), also called the '''Mera-Sakteng language''' after its speakers' home regions, is a [[Tibetic languages|Southern Tibetic language]] spoken by about 5000 people mainly in [[Merag Gewog|Mera]] and [[Sakteng Gewog]]s in the Sakteng Valley of [[Trashigang District]] in Eastern [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name=SIL1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=sgt |title=Brokpake |work=[[Ethnologue]] Online |publisher=[[SIL International]] |location=[[Dallas]] |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanDriem93&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |authorlink=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brokpa is spoken by descendants of pastoral [[yak]]herd communities.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;

The word brokpa has two parts. 'brok' and 'pa'. In Tibetic 'Brok' means mountain and 'pa' means native people, so the word 'Brokpa' refers to the language spoken by the people living on the mountains. 
[[Roger Blench]] has also recently named a language complex called Senge spoken in three villages northwest of [[Dirang]] in [[West Kameng district]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/South%20Asia/NEI/Bodish/Senge%20cluster/Sengres.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Dondrup (1993:3) lists the following Brokpa villages.
*[[West Kameng district]]
**Lubrung
**Dirme
**Sumrang
**Nyokmadung
**Undra &lt;ref&gt;first letter missing in book&lt;/ref&gt;
**Sengedrong
*[[Tawang district]]
**Lagam
**Mago
**Thingbu
**Lakuthang
*[[Bhutan]]
**Saklang

The 1981 census counted 1855 Brokpa people in [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5192">The term '''cotton ceiling''' refers to the difficulty [[transgender|trans people]] experience when seeking [[lesbian]] and [[gay]] relationships, and in lesbian and gay [[social space]]s more generally.

== Controversy ==

Some [[Transgender rights|trans rights activists]] have described this as [[transphobic]] [[social exclusion|exclusion]]. In 2014, [[Julia Serano]] wrote that "when the overwhelming majority of [[cisgender|cis]] [[Dyke (slang)|dykes]] date and fuck cis women, but are not open to, or are even turned off by, the idea of dating or fucking trans women, how is that not transphobic?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-struggle-to-find-trans-love-in-san-francisco|title=The Struggle To Find Trans Love In San Francisco|website=thedailybeast.com|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cisgender]] lesbian Andrea Zanin wrote in 2013 that "a lot of cis and otherwise non-trans gals need to ... take the opportunity to really examine how much of our desire rests on [[cissexism]], and how much of the sexual culture we create and consume excludes trans women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transadvocate.com/if-trans-women-arent-welcome-neither-am-i_n_10232.htm|title=If trans women aren't welcome, neither am I|website=transadvocate.com|date=25 September 2013|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other trans activists consider the concept problematic. Journalist [[Paris Lees]] wrote in 2015 that "there's a huge difference between denying someone a job versus not desiring someone sexually. Sexual attraction may be the one area that it's OK to 'discriminate' in—after all, it's up to you who you want to fuck—but you don't need to be a dick about your preference."&lt;ref name="paris" /&gt; Meanwhile, a 2013 [[Everyday Feminism]] article, written by an anonymous trans woman, stated that "the 'cotton ceiling' should be considered an unhelpful concept for this type of discussion and should be set aside by trans activists moving forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/05/getting-with-girls-like-us/|title=Getting With Girls Like Us: A Radical Guide To Dating Trans Women For Cis Women|website=everydayfeminism.com|date=12 May 2013|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is almost universally condemned by [[Feminist views on transgender topics|anti-trans activists]]. Academic [[Sheila Jeffreys]] wrote in her 2014 book "Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism" that '[t]he campaign relies on guilt-tripping, in which women who resist are accused of transphobia or transmisogyny, in an attempt to induce them to admit unwanted penises to their bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kLhwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=cotton+ceiling+trans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4AwdJgbb6J&amp;sig=QLAzz2Shhs-MFvujIEQmAcpWWHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijsZ_gvObYAhVRZlAKHQiFCIk4HhDoATAHegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cotton+ceiling+trans&amp;f=false|title=Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism|first=Sheila|last=Jeffreys|date=24 April 2014|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=22 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while in the same year blogger Julian Vigo wrote on [[CounterPunch]] that "[w]hile many are sympathetic to the fact that trans women wish to be accepted within social circles as women, they find it preposterous that lesbians are now being asked to deny their sexuality as proof of their solidarity with trans women, least (sic) they be labelled a bigot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2013/06/07/the-left-hand-of-darkness/|title=The Left Hand of Darkness|website=counterpunch.org|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|de|Rat für deutsche Rechtschreibung}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁaːt fyːɐ̯ ˈdɔʏtʃə ˈʁɛçtˌʃʁaɪbʊŋ}}, "'''Council for German Orthography'''" or "'''Council for German Spelling'''"&lt;ref name=goethe&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/mag/20802137.html|title=German Spelling Reform - Nearly a Culture War|last=Dittrich|first=Monika|date=July 2016|publisher=[[Goethe-Institut]]|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or '''{{lang|de|RdR}}''', is the main international body regulating [[German orthography]].

With its seat being in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]], the RdR was formed in 2004 as a successor to the ''{{lang|de|Zwischenstaatliche Kommission für deutsche Rechtschreibung}}'' ("Intergovernmental Commission for German Orthography") in order to include supporters as well as opponents of the [[German orthography reform of 1996]] (and subsequent reforms).&lt;ref name=goethe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rechtschreibrat.com/DOX/statut.pdf Official statute of the Council for German Orthography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the RdR is composed of 41 members from those states and regions in the [[German Sprachraum]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rechtschreibrat.com/der-rat/ueber-den-rat/|title=Die Mitglieder|publisher=Council for German Orthography|language=de|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|Germany}}: 18 councillors
* {{flag|Austria}}: 9 councillors
* {{flag|Switzerland}}: 9 councillors
* {{flag|South Tyrol}} ([[Italy]]): 1 councillor
* {{BE-DE}} of [[Belgium]]: 1 councillor
* {{flag|Liechtenstein}}: 1 councillor
* {{flag|Luxembourg}}: 1 observer (no voting right)

Despite having German as one of its official languages, [[Luxembourg]], which was not involved in devising the reform of 1996, is not a full member of the council. The government of Luxembourg unilaterally adopted the reform.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

According to the duchy's largest newspaper, the ''{{lang|de|[[Luxemburger Wort]]}}'', Luxembourg does not perceive itself as a "German-speaking country" (the only national language is [[Luxembourgish]]) and thus had no right to take part in the council.&lt;ref&gt;''Luxemburger Wort'', 9 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, Luxembourg participates in {{lang|fr|[[La Francophonie]]}} and has members in the {{lang|fr|[[Académie française]]}}, despite [[French language|French]] being only a co-official language, just like German.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|[http://www.francophonie.org/Carte-interactive-des-Etats-et.html Carte interactive des Etats et gouvernements membres], Organisation internationale de la Francophonie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chairman of the ''{{lang|de|[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]}}'' ({{lang|de|GfdS}}) is a member of the council. In 2003, the RdR, the GfdS, the ''{{lang|de|[[Goethe-Institut]]}}'' and the Institute of the German Language, founded the German Language Council (''{{lang|de|Deutscher Sprachrat}}''), which was later also joined by the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD).

'''Doba''' is a [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic language]] of Chad. It is traditionally considered three languages, because it is spoken by three ethnicities with separate identities, the Bedjond, the Mango, and the Gor. However, all have a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]], and so by that standard are a single language. 

Doba is the name of the town which is the center of the Mango people, and is used by linguists as a cover term for the three dialects.

The number of speakers is uncertain, as the latest figure for the Bedjond, 36,000, dates from 1969. Figures for the Gor (87,000) and Mango (52,000) date from 2006. 

Bedjond is also spelled ''Bediondo'' and ''Bejondo,'' and is also known as ''Bediondo Mbai, Mbay Bejondo,'' and ''Nangnda''. Dialects are Bedjond, Bébote, and Yom.

Gor is also known as ''Bodo''; Bodo and Yamod are dialects. 

Mango is also known and ''Mongo, Doba,'' and ''Mbay Doba.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2940">Nothing is known for certain of an alleged [[pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphical]] '''Epistle to the Alexandrians''' — purportedly by [[Paul the Apostle]] — that is mentioned in the [[Muratorian fragment]], one of the earliest lists of the [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|canonical texts of the New Testament]]. The anonymous author of the Muratorian canon considered spurious the letters claiming to have Paul as author, and that claim to be written [[Epistle to the Laodiceans|to the Laodiceans]] and this one to the Alexandrians, which are specifically said to be "forged in Paul's name to [further] the [[Marcionism|heresy of Marcion]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/muratorian-metzger.html |title=The Muratorian fragment |author=[[Bruce Metzger]] (translator) |publisher=EarlyChristianWritings.com |date= |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LC21"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfkKCyLoinQ |title=21: Formation Of The New Testament Canon |author=[[Bart D.

Theologian [[Theodor Zahn]] believed himself to have found a fragment of the Epistle to the Alexandrians in the shape of a lesson – a liturgical Epistle – in the (eighth century) Sacramentary and Lectionary of Bobbio (Paris Bib cat., Lat. 13246). It is headed Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians, but it is not from [[Epistle to the Colossians|that letter]] or any other known Pauline epistle.&lt;ref name="Hahneman"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hahneman |first=Geoffrey Mark |date=1992 |title=The Muratorian Fragment and the Development of the Canon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HKOJt33wLYC&amp;pg=PA196 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=196–197 |isbn=9780198263418 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars consider that it is simply an alternative title to the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], but they have been unable to convince their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Hahneman"/&gt; [[M. R. James]] argued that the word 'fincte' might be a scribal error, as many others in the Muratorian Fragment, and that it should be singular instead of plural, and so only the letter to the Alexandrians should be associated with the Marcionites, not the one to the Laodiceans.&lt;ref name="Hahneman"/&gt; [[Joseph Lightfoot]] suggested there was hiatus after 'Pauli nomine', and that 'fincte' does not apply to the epistles to the Laodiceans nor the Alexandrians, but to mutilated epistles of Marcion, so that the author considered neither to be a forgery.&lt;ref name="Hahneman"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9204">'''Flarf poetry''' was an ''[[avant-garde]]'' poetry movement of the early 21st century. The term '''Flarf''' was coined by the poet Gary Sullivan, who also wrote and published the earliest Flarf poems.&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Publishers Weekly|date=November 2001|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-9710371-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first practitioners, working in loose collaboration on an email listserv, used an approach that rejected conventional standards of quality and explored subject matter and tonality not typically considered appropriate for poetry. One of their central methods, invented by Drew Gardner, was to mine the [[Internet]] with odd search terms then distill the results into often hilarious and sometimes disturbing poems, plays and other texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pw.org/content/can_flarf_ever_be_taken_seriously?cmnt_all=1/|title=Can Flarf Ever Be Taken Seriously?|author=Shell Fischer|date=1 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pioneers of the movement include [[Jordan Davis (poet)|Jordan Davis]], Katie Degentesh, Drew Gardner, [[Nada Gordon]], Mitch Highfill, [[Rodney Koeneke]], Michael Magee, [[Sharon Mesmer]], Mel Nichols, Katie F-S, [[K. Silem Mohammad]], [[Rod Smith (poet)|Rod Smith]], Gary Sullivan and others.

==Overview==

[[Joyelle McSweeney]] wrote in the ''Constant Critic'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constantcritic.com/joyelle_mcsweeney/petroleum_hat/|title=Constant Critic – Joyelle McSweeney – Petroleum Hat|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|Jangly, cut-up textures, speediness, and bizarre trajectories … I love a movement that’s willing to describe its texts as "a kind of corrosive, cute, or cloying awfulness". This is utterly tonic in a poetry field crowded by would-be sincerists unwilling to own up to their poems’ self-aggrandizing, sentimental, bloviating, or [[sexist]] tendencies.}}

[[Joshua Clover]] wrote in ''The Claudius App'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theclaudiusapp.com/1-clover.html|title=Joshua Clover – Generals and Globetrotters – The Claudius App|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|If both (conceptual poetry and flarf) are compelled by what we might term impoetic language, flarf seems interested in discovering the poetic within that field, finding the excess and alterity that once defined poetic language but now must be found elsewhere, within the circuits of ersatz fame and junkspeech, within the anonymized and reshuffled errancies of various machinic protocols (whether it is the Google search algorithm, or  a purported human adapting herself to the imperatives of a virtual chatroom.}}

In 2007, [[Barrett Watten]], a poet and cultural critic, long associated with the so-called [[Language poets]] observed that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/index.html How ''The Grand Piano'' Is Being Written].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|It is precisely, however, to the degree that Flarf does something new performatively and with its use of the detritus of popular cultural and the internet, treading the high/low distinction until it breaks under the weight, that it reinvents the avant-garde. In a larger aesthetic economy, it seems, "the truth will out". Flarf's recent productivity shows how the injunction against the sentence, paragraph, narrative, and even discourse from some sectors of the [[Language poetry|Language school]] intersects with actual conditions of language use. Any such thing as stylistic norms in the avant-garde must inevitably intersect with "life". }}

Discussion about Flarf has been broadcast by the [[BBC]] and [[NPR]] and published in magazines such as [[The Atlantic]], [[Bookforum]], ''The Constant Critic'', ''Jacket'', [[The Nation]], ''Rain Taxi'', ''The Wall Street Journal'' and [[The Village Voice]]. Further discussion has taken place on dozens of [[blogs]] and [[listservs]] across the United States, and in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Holland, Mexico, and elsewhere.

A "'''flip-flop'''" (used mostly in the United States), '''U-turn''' (used in the [[politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Pakistan]]), or '''backflip''' (used in Australia and New Zealand) is a sudden real or apparent change of policy or opinion by a public official, sometimes while trying to claim that both positions are consistent with each other. Often it will occur during the period prior to or following an election in order to maximize the candidate's popularity.

==History==

In his "On Language" column in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[William Safire]] wrote in 1988 that "flip-flop" has a long history as a synonym for "somersault". (He cited George Lorimer in 1902: "...when a fellow's turning flip-flops up among the clouds, he's naturally going to have the farmers gaping at him.") In the late 19th century, a US politician was called "the Florida flopper" by an opponent, Safire noted. The "fl" sound appearing twice is an indication of ridicule, he wrote. Citing grammarian Randolph Quirk, Safire pointed out that the doubling of the sound is also a feature in other two-word phrases used to disparage the actions or words of others, including "[[mumbo jumbo (phrase)|mumbo jumbo]]", "wishy-washy", and higgledy-piggledy".&lt;ref name="wsonnyt"&gt;Saffire, William, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3D6113DF930A25750C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Phantom of the Phrases "], "On Language" column, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', March 13, 1988 (comment from Wicker is as quoted by Safire), retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the archives of ''The New York Times'', which go back to 1851, the earliest unequivocal mention of "flip-flop" as a change in someone's opinion, is in an October 23, 1890, report of a campaign speech in New York City. John W. Goff, candidate for district attorney, said of one of his opponents: "I would like to hear Mr. Nicoll explain his great flip-flop, for three years ago, you know, as the Republican candidate for District Attorney, he bitterly denounced [[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] as a party run by bosses and in the interest of bossism.... Nicoll, who three years ago was denouncing Tammany, is its candidate to-day."&lt;ref&gt;No byline, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/10/23/103273441.pdf "Mighty cheers for Scott / A great meeting in Cooper Union last night."], news article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 23, 1890, retrieved from ''Times'' subscription archives June 23, 2008 (sometimes accessible without subscription)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used in 1967, when a ''New York Times'' editorial and ''Times'' columnist [[Tom Wicker]] used it in commenting on different events. It was also in the [[U.S. Presidential election, 1976|1976 election]], when President [[Gerald Ford]] used the phrase against his opponent [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=flip-flop&amp;srchst=p Search results for "flip-flop"], ''[[New York Times]]'' archives, 1850–1981, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 U.S. presidential election]], [[Michael Dukakis]] used the term against opponent [[Richard Gephardt]], saying, "There's a flip-flopper over here" about Gephardt.&lt;ref name="wsonnyt" /&gt;

The term also was used extensively in the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]] campaign. It was used by critics as a catch-phrase attack on [[John Kerry]], claiming he was "flip-flopping" his stance on several issues, including the ongoing war in Iraq. Famously, on March 16, 2004, during an appearance at [[Marshall University]] Kerry tried to explain his vote for an $87 billion supplemental appropriation for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan by telling the crowd, "I actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it." After the remark became controversial, he explained that he had supported an earlier Democratic measure that would have paid for the $87 billion in war funding by reducing Bush's tax cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry discusses $87 billion comment |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/kerry.comment/ |publisher=CNN |id= |date=September 30, 2004 |accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FactCheck]] stated that "Kerry has never wavered from his support for giving Bush authority to use force in Iraq, nor has he changed his position that he, as President, would not have gone to war without greater international support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/bush_ad_twists_kerrys_words_on_iraq.html FactCheck.org: Bush Ad Twists Kerry's Words on Iraq] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209150357/http://www.factcheck.org/bush_ad_twists_kerrys_words_on_iraq.html |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "U-turn" in the United Kingdom was famously applied to [[Edward Heath]], the [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1974. Prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] compiled a [[manifesto]] that highlighted [[free-market]] economic policies. Heath abandoned such policies when his government nationalised [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] (hence the actual "U-turn"). The Conservative government was later attacked for such a move because [[nationalisation]] was seen (by the [[Thatcherism|Thatcher era]]) as antithetical to Conservative beliefs. This later led to one of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s most famous phrases: "[[The lady's not for turning|you turn [U-turn] if you want to. The lady's not for turning]]". The Conservatives would adopt the free market under her.

==Exculpatory, ameliorating and aggravating circumstances affecting public reaction==

The circumstances surrounding the flip-flop and its larger context can be crucial factors in whether or not a politician is hurt or helped more by a change in position. "Long hailed as a conservative champion, [[Ronald Reagan]] could shrug off his support of a tax increase in 1982 to curb the budget deficits his 1981 tax cut had exacerbated," according to an analysis of flip-flopping in ''The New York Times''. "Long suspect on the Republican right, [[George H. W. Bush|George [H. W.] Bush]] faced a crippling 1992 primary challenge after abandoning his 'no new taxes' campaign pledge in the White House."&lt;ref name="jhnyt"&gt;Harwood, John, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/us/politics/23caucus.html "Flip-Flops Are Looking Like a Hot Summer Trend"], "The Caucus" feature, ''The New York Times'', June 23, 2008, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry's perceived equivocation on the Iraq war damaged his 2004 campaign, according to both Democratic and Republican political operatives. "It spoke to a pattern of calculation and indecisiveness that make him look like a weak commander in chief compared to [George W.] Bush", said Jonathan Prince, a strategist for 2008 presidential candidate [[John Edwards]], Kerry's running mate in 2004. In the 2008 primary season, Edwards simply stated that "I was wrong" when he had voted in the U.S. Senate to authorize the Iraq War. "Progressives loved it because it was taking responsibility, not abdicating it," according to Prince.&lt;ref name="jhnyt" /&gt;

United States commentator [[Jim Geraghty]] has written that politicians need to be allowed some leeway in changing their minds as the result of changing conditions. "I actually think that a candidate can even change his position in response to a changing political environment, as long as they're honest about it. 'The votes just aren't there, public support isn't there, so I have to put this proposal on the back burner for a while,' is a perfectly legitimate response to a difficult position."&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, Jim, [http://campaignspot.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmVmYzM2NTEwZWI5MTI1ODgyNmUyZGMzMDU0ZTgyNzU= "Measuring the Flip-Flops"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} post at "The Campaign Spot" blog at the "National Review Online" website, June 23, 2008, 12:32&amp;nbsp;pm post, accessed same day{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same general point was made in 1988 by ''New York Times'' editorial columnist [[Tom Wicker]], writing shortly after Dukakis' charge against Gephardt. Wicker commented that the accusation was not necessarily fair: "What's wrong with a Presidential candidate changing his position – though his opponents call it 'flip-flopping' – in order to improve his chances of winning? Nothing's wrong with it [...] unless the flipper [...] denies having done it," Wicker added that the charge can be "a tortured or dishonest interpretation of an opponent's record".&lt;ref name="wsonnyt" /&gt;

"[T]here's a difference between changing your policy position and breaking a promise," [[John Dickerson (journalist)|John Dickerson]], wrote in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' online magazine. "Breaking a promise is a problem of a higher order than changing a policy position. Our mothers told us not to break promises [...]"&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, John, [http://www.slate.com/id/2194083?nav=wp "The Flip-Flop Brothers: Both McCain and Obama wobbled. Who will pay the price?"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, June 20, 2008, 6:32&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern Time, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

James Pethokoukis, the "money and politics blogger" for ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' online, referring to 2008 presidential candidate [[John McCain]], noted that in changing a position a candidate can "trot out that famous [[John Maynard Keynes]] line, 'When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?'"&lt;ref&gt;Pethoukoukis, James, [https://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/6/16/7-ways-mccain-can-use-energy-to-beat-obama.html "7 Ways McCain Can Use Energy to Beat Obama"], "Capital Commerce" blog, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' online, June 16, 2008, 01:02&amp;nbsp;pm ET, retrieved June 23, 2008{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Keynes quote also has been mentioned by other commentators with regard to flip-flops, including James Broder, in a 2007 article in the ''[[International Herald-Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="jbiht"&gt;Broder, John M., [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=140971 "In past, clues to way Fed chief met mortgage crisis"], ''[[The International Herald-Tribune]]'', August 19, 2007, retrieved June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-political use==
Outside politics the use of the term is not as pejorative. A scientist or mathematician can often obtain some experimental results or logical proofs which causes one to flip flop on a previously held belief. Example: "I always assumed that there was an infinity, that all infinite numbers were equal, but I have flip flopped on that since I saw Georg Cantor's proof." Lewis Eigen, in his essay on the cultural difference between politics and scientists, observes, "To the scientist, failure to flip-flop in the face of contradictory evidence is irrational and dangerous behavior. And scientists will often flip-flop at almost light speed. Often it takes only a single observation to flip-flop thousands of scientifically learned people."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D. Eigen, "Flip-Flop: Political Vice–Scientific Virtue". ''Scriptamus'', 2009, http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/flip-flop-political-vice-scientific-virtue/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
'''Forensic linguistics''', '''legal linguistics''', or '''language and the law''', is the application of [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge, methods and insights to the [[forensic]] context of law, language, crime investigation, trial, and judicial procedure. It is a branch of [[applied linguistics]].

There are principally three areas of application for linguists working in forensic contexts:&lt;ref name=Aston&gt;{{Cite web |title=Centre for Forensic Linguistics |publisher=Aston University |url=http://www.forensiclinguistics.net/cfl_fl.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927010829/http://www.forensiclinguistics.net/cfl_fl.html |archivedate=27 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* understanding language of the written law,
* understanding language use in forensic and judicial processes, and
* the provision of linguistic evidence.

The discipline of forensic linguistics is not homogenous; it involves a range of experts and researchers in different areas of the field.

==History==

The phrase ''forensic linguistics'' first appeared in 1968 when Jan Svartvik, a professor of [[linguistics]], used it in an analysis of statements by [[Timothy John Evans]].&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"&gt;John Olsson (2008), ''Forensic Linguistics, Second Edition''. London: Continuum {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was in regard to re-analyzing the statements given to police at [[Notting Hill]] police station in 1949 in the case of an alleged murder by Evans. Evans was suspected of murdering his wife and baby and was tried and hanged for the crime. Yet, when Svartvik studied the statements allegedly given by Evans, he found that there were different stylistic markers involved, and Evans did not actually give the statements to the police officers as had been stated at the trial.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Olsson, John. “What Is Forensic Linguistics?” ''[http://www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Sparked by this case, early forensic linguistics in the UK were focused on questioning the validity of police interrogations. As seen in numerous famous cases (e.g. the convictions of Derek Bentley, the Guildford Four, the Bridgewater Three, etc.), many of the major concerns were of the statements police officers used. Numerous times, the topic of police register came up – this meaning the type of stylist language and vocabulary used by officers of the law when transcribing witness statements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Moving to the US and the beginnings of the field of forensic linguistics, the field really began with the 1963 case of Ernesto Miranda. His case led to the creation of Miranda Rights and pushed focus of forensic linguistics on witness questioning rather than police statements. Various cases came about that challenged whether or not suspects truly understood what their rights meant – leading to a distinction of coercive versus voluntary interrogations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

During the early days of forensic linguistics in the United Kingdom, the legal defense for many criminal cases questioned the authenticity of police statements. At the time, customary police procedure for taking suspects' statements dictated that it be in a specific format, rather than in the suspect's own words. Statements by witnesses are very seldom made in a coherent or orderly fashion, with speculation and backtracking done out loud. The delivery is often too fast-paced, causing important details to be left out.

Forensic linguistics can be traced back as early as a 1927 to a ransom note in Corning, New York. As the Associated Press reported&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [http://nyshistoricnewspapers.org/lccn/sn84031094/1927-09-09/ed-1/seq-2/# "Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note"]&lt;/ref&gt; in "Think Corning Girl Wrote Ransom Note" "Duncan McLure, of Johnson City uncle of the (kidnapped) girl, is the only member of the family to spell his name 'McLure' instead of 'McClure.' The letter he received, supposedly from the kidnappers, was addressed to him by the proper name, indicating that the writer was familiar with the difference in spelling."  Other work of forensic linguistics in the United States concerned the rights of individuals with regard to understanding their [[Miranda rights]] during the interrogation process.&lt;ref&gt;Olsson, John. "What Is Forensic Linguistics?" ''[http://www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf www.thetext.co.uk/what_is.pdf]'' (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of forensic linguistics in the United States was related to the status of trademarks as words or phrases in the language. One of the bigger cases involved fast food giant [[McDonald's]] claiming that it had originated the process of attaching unprotected words to the 'Mc' prefix (referred to as [[McWords]]) and was unhappy with Quality Inns International's intention of opening a chain of economy hotels to be called 'McSleep'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Ayres, Jr | first = B. Drummond | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/22/us/mcdonald-s-to-court-mc-is-ours.html | title = McDonald's, to Court: 'Mc' Is Ours | date=22 July 1988 | accessdate = 19 March 2012 | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Australian linguists discussed the application of linguistics and sociolinguistics to legal issues.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They discovered that a phrase such as {{'}}''the same language''{{'}} is open to interpretation. Aboriginal people have their own understanding and use of 'English', something that is not always appreciated by speakers of the dominant version of English, i.e., 'white English'. The Aboriginal people also bring their own culturally-based interactional styles to the interview.

The 2000s saw a considerable shift in the field of forensic linguistics, which has been described as a coming-of-age of the discipline. Not only does the field have professional associations such as the International Association of Forensic Linguistics (IAFL) founded in 1993, and the Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics (AALL) founded in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics. 2017. "Gründung der Österreichischen Gesellschaft für Rechtslinguistik. Abendgymnasium Wien. http://wien.abendgymnasium.at/gruendung-der-oesterreichischen-gesellschaft-fuer-rechtslinguistik/&lt;/ref&gt; it can now provide the scientific community with a range of textbooks such as Coulthard and Johnson (2007), Gibbons (2003) and Olsson (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Alison Johnson, Malcolm Coulthard. 2010. "Current debates in forensic linguistics". The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics. London: Routledge, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of study==
The range of topics within forensic linguistics is diverse, but research occurs in the following areas:

===The language of legal texts===
The study of the language of legal texts encompasses a wide range of forensic texts. That includes the study of text types and forms of analysis. Any text or item of spoken language can potentially be a forensic text when it is used in a legal or criminal context.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; This includes analysing the linguistics of documents as diverse as Acts of Parliament (or other law-making body), private wills, court judgements and summonses and the statutes of other bodies, such as States and government departments. One important area{{Original research inline|date=November 2010}} is that of the transformative effect of [[Norman French]] and [[Latin|Ecclesiastic Latin]] on the development of the English common law, and the evolution of the legal specifics associated with it.  It can also refer to the ongoing attempts at making [[legal writing|legal language]] more comprehensible to laypeople.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A forensic linguistics understanding of the relationship between language and law has been voiced by Leisser who states that 
* "It is indeed hard to deny that the rule of law is in fact the rule of language. It seems that there cannot be law without language. Kelsen (1945: 161) wrote that '[j]ust as everything King Midas touched turned into gold, everything to which the law refers becomes law, i.e. something legally e x i s t i n g'. The concept of law is conveyed and mediated entirely through the structures of human language and it is thus plausible to assume that everything the law touches is therefore also touched by language. This is particularly evident in the fact that all processes of legal meaning-making and meaning-seeking are inextricably tied to the language system. ... [L]aw is defined as a set of linguistic signs which is ascribed the societal power to control human conduct."&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Leisser]] (2017) ''„Adjectival Vagueness in Legal Language: The Case of the Austrian Civil Code“'' Vienna: University of Vienna, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The language of legal processes===
Among other things, this area examines language as it is used in cross-examination, evidence presentation, judge's direction, police cautions, police testimonies in court, summing up to a jury, interview techniques, the questioning process in court and in other areas such as police interviews.

Police officers use specific language to elicit certain responses from civilians. Because of a police officers' social stature, and the way they often phrase "requests" as "commands", people may be confused as to what their rights are when they are being questioned by police. Officers use linguistic tactics including putting the blame onto the victim and asking questions with ambiguous phrasing to elicit specific responses from people (Solan, L. &amp; Tiersma, P, 2005).

A defendant using ambiguity in the courtroom may present issues and be deemed unacceptable. Specifically, when a victim is invoking their right to a lawyer, there are directions stating that the request may not come off as ambiguous. In fact, if the request is not stated in a way that the officer deems to be clear, the victim may not receive their request for counsel at all. Refer to the following link to explore an example through the ''Louisiana vs. Demesme'' case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasc.org/news_releases/2017/2017-052.asp|title=2017-052.asp|website=www.lasc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the examination process, language plays a substantial role in the presentation of a story to the courtroom. Specifically, the language used by the lawyer to construct the story to the courtroom elicits specific responses from the witness, and specific emotions from the jury. For example, in an instance where a lawyer is examining a hostile witness, they will often use language to limit the response of the witness, in order to avoid having the witness present conflicting evidence. In this instance, yes/no questions will be targeted, and questions with room for elaboration, such as wh-formation questions, will likely be avoided. In a situation where a lawyer interviews a friendly witness whose testimony could potentially strengthen the story constructed by the lawyer, the opposite may occur where wh-questions are targeted to allow for elaboration (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

Lawyers employs specific tactics for both themselves and their witnesses to come off as more or less truthful to the jury and the people of the courtroom. For example, the lawyer may refer to the witness by their first name or a nickname to humanize the witness, or they may speak using slang in order to create less social distance between himself and the courtroom. The lawyer may also avoid using slang, and instead use complicated law terminology to set himself apart from the courtroom and define his status (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

The lawyer works in constructing the language of the legal process of the courtroom, and specific witnesses may respond to the lawyer's questions in different ways, eliciting new language tactics and opinions from the jury. For example, witnesses may use direct or indirect speech based on their previous societal experiences, gender differences, socioeconomic differences, or differences in education level. Using particular dialects, slang, or sentence formations could assist in making the witness more or less truthful to the jury (Olsson, Luchjenborers, 2013).

==Forensic text types==

===Emergency call===
In an emergency call, the recipient or emergency operator's ability to extract primarily linguistic information in threatening situations and to come up with the required response in a timely manner is crucial to the successful completion of the call. Intonational emphasis, voice pitch and the extent to which there is cooperation between the caller and the recipient at any one time are also very important in analysing an emergency call. Full cooperation includes frank and timely responses.

Urgency plays a role in emergency calls, so hesitations, signs of evasiveness, and incomplete or overly short answers indicate that the caller might be making a false or hoax call. A genuine call has distinctive interlocking and slight overlap of turns. The recipient trusts the caller to provide accurate information and the caller trusts the recipient to ask only pertinent questions. If the caller uses a rising pitch at the end of every turn, it might represent a lack of commitment; the recipient's use of a rising pitch indicates doubt or desire for clarification. The call ideally moves from nil knowledge on the part of the recipient to a maximum amount of knowledge in a minimum possible period of time. This makes the emergency call unlike any other kind of service encounter.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;

===Ransom demands or other threat communication===
Threat is a counterpart of a promise and is an important feature in a ransom demand. Ransom demands are also examined to identify between genuine and false threats. An example of a ransom note analysis can be seen in the case of the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], where the first ransom note (sometimes referred to as the Nursery Note) stated: "We warn you for making anyding public or for notify the Polise the child is in gut care" (''sic'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/lindbergh/sfeature/crime.html|title=The Kidnapping|work=PBS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the sentence, the kidnapper makes the claim that the child is in good hands but to make such a claim, the note would have to be written before the perpetrator enters the premises. Therefore, the claim is false (at the time of writing) since the kidnapper had not even encountered the child when he wrote the note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ransom Notes: An Analysis of Their Content &amp; "Signature"|author=Falzini, Mark W.|work=Archival Ramblings|url=http://njspmuseum.blogspot.com/2008/02/one-of-most-fascinating-areas-of-study.html|date=9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kidnappers may write statements that later end up being true, such as "your child is being held in a private location" being written ahead of time.

===Suicide letters===
A suicide note is typically brief, concise and highly propositional with a degree of evasiveness.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; A credible suicide letter must be making a definite unequivocal proposition in a situational context. The proposition of genuine suicide is thematic, directed to the addressee (or addressees) and relevant to the relationship between them. Suicide notes generally have sentences alluding to the act of killing oneself, or the method of suicide that was undertaken.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2004" /&gt; The contents of a suicide note could be intended to make the addressee suffer or feel guilt. Genuine suicide letters are short, typically less than 300 words in length.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; Extraneous or irrelevant material is often excluded from the text.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2004"&gt;John Olsson (2004). ''An Introduction to Language Crime and the Law''. London: Continuum International Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death row statements===
Death row statements either admit the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of honesty and forthrightness; or deny the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of innocence. They may also denounce witnesses as dishonest, critique law enforcement as corrupt in an attempt to portray innocence or seek an element of revenge in their last moments (Olsson 2004). Death row statements are within the heavily institutionalized setting of death row prisons.
The Forensic Linguistics Institute holds a corpus of these documents and is conducting research on them.

===Social media===
Social media statements are often context specific, and their interpretation can be highly subjective. Forensic application of a selection of stylistic and stylometric techniques in a simulated authorship attribution case involving texts has been done in relation to [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author=C.S. Michell|year=2013|title=Investigating the use of forensic stylistic and stylometric techniques in the analysis of authorship on a publicly accessible social networking site (Facebook)|degree=MA in Linguistics|publisher=University of South Africa|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/13324/dissertation_michell_cs.pdf?sequence=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of social media postings can reveal whether they are illegal (e.g. sex trade) or unethical (e.g. intended to harm) or whether they are not (e.g. simply provocative or free speech).&lt;ref&gt;C. Hardaker (2015). The ethics of online aggression: Where does “virtual” end, and “reality” begin? BAAL Conference on The Ethics of Online Research Methods. Cardiff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of linguistic evidence in legal proceedings==
These areas of application have varying degrees of acceptability or reliability within the field. Linguists have provided evidence in:
* [[Trademark]] and other intellectual property disputes
* Disputes of meaning and use
* Author identification (determining who wrote an anonymous text by making comparisons to known writing samples of a suspect; such as threat letters, mobile phone texts or emails)

Specialist databases of samples of spoken and written natural language (called [[text corpus|corpora]]) are now frequently used by forensic linguists. These include corpora of suicide notes, mobile phone texts, police statements, police interview records and witness statements. They are used to analyse language, understand how it is used, and to reduce the effort needed to identify words that tend to occur near each other (collocations or collocates).

===Author identification===
The identification of whether a given individual said or wrote something relies on analysis of their [[idiolect]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard, M. (2004). Author identification, idiolect and linguistic uniqueness. ''Applied Linguistics'', 25(4), 431-447.&lt;/ref&gt; or particular patterns of language use (vocabulary, collocations, pronunciation, spelling, grammar, etc). The idiolect is a theoretical construct based on the idea that there is linguistic variation at the group level and hence there may also be linguistic variation at the individual level. [[William Labov]] has stated that nobody has found a "homogenous data" in idiolects,&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William (1972) ''Sociolinguistic patterns''. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, p192.&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many reasons why it is difficult to provide such evidence.

Firstly, language is not an inherited property, but one which is socially acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, pp 151-167&lt;/ref&gt; Because acquisition is continuous and life-long, an individual's use of language is always susceptible to variation from a variety of sources, including other speakers, the media and macro-social changes. Education can have a profoundly homogenizing effect on language use.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt; Research into authorship identification is ongoing. The term authorship attribution is now felt to be too deterministic.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, T. D. (2008). Approaching questions in forensic authorship analysis. In J. Gibbons &amp; M. T. Turell (Eds.), ''Dimensions of Forensic Linguistics''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paucity of documents (ransom notes, threatening letters, etc) in most criminal cases in a forensic setting means there is often too little text upon which to base a reliable identification. However, the information provided may be adequate to eliminate a suspect as an author or narrow down an author from a small group of suspects.

Authorship measures that analysts use include word length average, average number of syllables per word, [[Article (grammar)|article]] frequency, type-token ratio, punctuation (both in terms of overall density and syntactic boundaries) and the measurements of [[hapax legomena]] (unique words in a text). Statistical approaches include [[factor analysis]], [[Bayesian statistics]], [[Poisson distribution]], [[multivariate analysis]], and [[discriminant function analysis]] of function words.

The Cusum (Cumulative Sum) method for text analysis has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, A.Q., and S. Michaelson (1990) ''The Qsum Plot''. Internal Report CSR-3-90, Department of Computer Science, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; Cusum analysis works even on short texts and relies on the assumption that each speaker has a unique set of habits, thus rendering no significant difference between their speech and writing. Speakers tend to utilize two to three letter words in a sentence and their utterances tend to include vowel-initial words.

In order to carry out the Cusum test on habits of utilizing two to three letter words and vowel-initial words in a sentential clause, the occurrences of each type of word in the text must be identified and the distribution plotted in each sentence. The Cusum distribution for these two habits will be compared with the average sentence length of the text. The two sets of values should track each other. Any altered section of the text would show a distinct discrepancy between the values of the two reference points. The tampered section will exhibit a different pattern from the rest of the text.

===Forensic stylistics===
This discipline subjects written or spoken materials (or both), to scientific analysis for determination and measurement of content, meaning, speaker identification, or determination of authorship, in identifying [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does forensic linguistics/stylistics work in criminal issues? Answers|website=enotes.com|url=http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/linguistics-forensic-stylistics|date=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} cases where forensic stylistics was used to detect [[plagiarism]] was the case of [[Helen Keller]]'s short story "[[The Frost King]]", in which the blind American author was accused of [[plagiarism]] in 1892. An investigation revealed that [[The Frost King]] had been plagiarised from Margaret Canby's ''Frost Fairies'' which had been read to Keller some time earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamenjivarblog.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/when-helen-froze-over/|title=WHEN HELEN FROZE OVER|accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that Keller had made only minute changes to common words and phrases and used less common words to say the same thing, suggesting mere alterations to original ideas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Keller used 'vast wealth' instead of 'treasure' (approximately 230 times less common in the language) 'bethought' instead of 'concluded' (approximately 450 times less common), 'bade them' instead of 'told them' (approximately 30 times less common). Keller used the phrase 'ever since that time' whilst Canby chose 'from that time' (the latter 50 times more common than the former). Keller also used ' I cannot imagine' whereas Canby used ' I do not know'. 'Know' is approximately ten times more common than 'imagine'. Keller relied on a lexis that is less common when compared to Canby's. The Flesch and [[Flesch-Kincaid]] readability test showed that Canby's text showing more originality compared to Keller's. Canby's text obtained a higher grade on the reading ease scale compared to Keller's. The distinctions between Keller and Canby's text are at the lexical and phrasal level.

Other examples of plagiarism include the cases between [[Richard Condon]], author of [[The Manchurian Candidate]] and English novelist [[Robert Graves]] and between [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and Archibald Carey. Judging by the text in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'', Condon's work is seen to be rich in clichés such as ''"in his superstitious heart of hearts."'' While [[Helen Keller]] took pride in using rare phrases and avoids common source words, Condon was fond of expanding existing words into phrases and existing phrases into more extensive ones. Condon was also found to have borrowed from a wide range of Graves' work.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"/&gt; However, in the plagiarism case between [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and Archibald Carey, almost half of King's doctoral dissertation was discovered to have been copied from another theology student. King simply changed the names of the mountains and used much more [[alliteration]] and [[assonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Boston U. Panel Finds Plagiarism by Dr. King | date= 11 October 1991|accessdate=2008-06-14|work=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD61030F932A25753C1A967958260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carey's and Graves' texts (source texts) were noticeably shorter, pithier and simpler in structure while Condon's and King's texts relied on 'purple' devices, extending the existing text and flourish their language significantly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Another famous example is the case of [[Theodore Kaczynski]], who was eventually convicted of being the "Unabomber", family members recognized his writing style from the published 35,000-word ''[[wikisource:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'' (commonly called the "Unabomber Manifesto"), and notified the authorities. FBI agents searching Kaczynski's hut found hundreds of documents written by Kaczynski but not published anywhere. An analysis produced by FBI Supervisory Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald identified numerous lexical items and phrases common to the two documents.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, J. R. (2004). "Using a forensic linguistic approach to tracking the Unabomber." In J. Campbell, &amp; D. DeNevi (Eds.)''Profilers: Leading investigators take you inside the criminal mind'' (pp. 193-222). New York: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some were more distinctive than others, but the prosecution argued that even the more common words and phrases being used by Kaczynski became distinctive when used in combination with each other.&lt;ref name="Coulthard &amp; Johnson:2007" /&gt;

===Discourse analysis===
[[Discourse analysis]] deals with analyzing written, oral, or sign language use, or any significant [[semiotic]] event. According to the method, the close analysis of a covert recording can produce useful deductions. The use of 'I' instead of 'We' in a recording highlights non-complicity in a conspiracy. The utterance of 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' as responses indicate that the suspect understands the suggestion, while feedback markers such as 'yeah' and 'uh-huh' do not denote the suspect's agreement to the suggestion. Discourse analysts are not always allowed to testify but during preparation for a case they are often useful to lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Linguistic dialectology===
This refers to the study of dialects in a methodological manner based on anthropological information. It is becoming more important to conduct systematic studies of dialects, especially within the English language, because they are no longer as distinct as they once were due to the onslaught of mass media and population mobility. Political and social issues have also caused languages to straddle geographical borders resulting in certain language varieties spoken in multiple countries, leading to complications when determining an individual's origin by means of his/her language or dialect.

Dialectology was used during the investigations into the [[Wearside Jack|Yorkshire Ripper tape hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Fido (1994), ''The Chronicle of Crime: The infamous felons of modern history and their hideous crimes''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic phonetics===
The forensic phonetician is concerned with the production of accurate transcriptions of what was being said. Transcriptions can reveal information about a speaker's social and regional background. Forensic phonetics can determine similarities between the speakers of two or more separate recordings.  Voice recording as a supplement to the transcription can be useful as it allows victims and witnesses to indicate whether the voice of a suspect is that of the accused, i.e., alleged criminal.

A man accused of manufacturing the drug [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] was mis-heard by the police transcriber as 'hallucinogenic'&lt;ref name="Coulthard &amp; Johnson:2007"&gt;Coulthard, M., &amp; Johnson, A. (2007). ''An introduction to forensic linguistics: Language in evidence''. Oxford: Routledge:162-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The police transcriber heard ''"but if it's as you say it's hallucinogenic, it's in the Sigma catalogue."'' However, the actual utterance was ''"but if it's as you say it's German, it's in the Sigma catalogue."''

Another disputed utterance was between a police officer and a suspect. One of the topics of conversation was a third man known as 'Ernie'. The poor signal of the recording made 'Ernie' sound like 'Ronnie'. The surveillance tape presented acoustic problems: an intrusive electronic-sounding cackle, the sound of the car engine, the playing of the car radio, the movement of the target vehicle, and the intrusive noise coincided with the first syllable of the disputed name.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008"/&gt;

[[Forensic speechreading]] is the complement of forensic voice identification. Transcripts of surveilled video records can sometimes allow expert speechreaders to identify speech content or style where the identity of the talker is apparent from the video record.

===Examples===
Evidence from forensic linguistics has more power to eliminate someone as a suspect than to prove him or her guilty.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Linguistic expertise has been employed in criminal cases to defend an individual suspected of a crime, and during government investigations. Forensic linguists have given expert evidence in a wide variety of cases, including abuse of process, where police statements were found to be too similar to have been independently produced by police officers; the authorship of [[hate mail]]; the authorship of letters to an Internet child pornography service; the contemporaneity of an arsonist's diary; the comparison between a set of mobile phone texts and a suspect's police interview, and the reconstruction of a mobile phone text conversation. Some well-known examples include an appeal against the conviction of [[Derek Bentley]] the identification of [[Subcomandante Marcos]], the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]]' charismatic leader by [[Max Appedole]] and the identification of [[Theodore Kaczynski]] as the so-called "[[Unabomber]]" by [[James R. Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/manhunt-unabomber-fbi-ted-kaczynski-james-fitzgerald-643594|title='Manhunt: Unabomber' explores how a federal investigator caught Ted Kaczynski and changed FBI profiling forever|date=2017-07-29|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal laboratories ''Bundeskriminalamt'' (in Germany) and the ''Nederlands Forensisch Instituut'' (in the [[Netherlands]]) both employ forensic linguists.&lt;ref name="Tiersma, Peter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageandlaw.org/FORENSIC.HTM|title=forensic linguistics|first=peter|last=tiersma|website=www.languageandlaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguistics contributed to the overturning of [[Derek Bentley]]'s conviction for murder in 1998 although there were other non-linguistic issues. Nineteen-year-old Bentley, who was [[Functional illiteracy|functionally illiterate]], had been hanged in 1953 for his part in the murder of PC Sidney Miles; he had been convicted partly on the basis of his statement to police, allegedly transcribed verbatim from a spoken [[monologue]]. When the case was reopened, a forensic linguist found that the frequency and usage of the word "then" in police transcripts suggested the transcripts were not verbatim statements but had been partially authored by police interviewers; this and other evidence led to Bentley's posthumous pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard, R.M. (2000). " ''Whose text is it? On the linguistic investigation of authorship'' ", in S. Sarangi and R.M. Coulthard: ''Discourse and Social Life''. London, Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the investigative stage to identify Subcomandante Marcos, the [[Mexican government]] speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante, Salvador Morales Garibay, gave away the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas to the Mexican government, among them Marcos' identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf «El otro subcomandante»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111100/http://www.letraslibres.com/sites/default/files/pdfs_articulos/pdf_art_5673_5540.pdf |date=2013-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They all were indicted for terrorism, arrest warrants were issued and arrests were made in a military action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5tZRlQk_8s»]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government alleges some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressures claiming for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On February 9, 1995, in a televised special Presidential broadcast, President [[Ernesto Zedillo]] announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, born June 19, 1957, in [[Tampico]], [[Tamaulipas]] to [[Spain|Spanish]] immigrants, an [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]] School of Sciences and Arts for the Design former Professor. And after the government revealed Marcos' identity in January 1995, when Max Appedole, old friend, classmate with the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] at the [[Instituto Cultural Tampico]], made direct intervention in the conflict. Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a Military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, by demonstrating that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzUQqpDptm8»]&lt;/ref&gt; Rafael Guillén, was no terrorist. Max Appedole identified Marcos' linguistic fingerprint based on Marcos' specific, unique way of speaking, recognized his literary style in all Marcos' manifestos that were published in the media, linked them to their literary tournaments organized by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in which they competed in Mexico. Everyone has an [[idiolect]], encompassing vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, that differs from the way other people talk. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, a pacifist. Max Appedole closed the first successful linguistic profiling confirmation case in the history of law enforcement. Based on these achievements this new science was developed, giving way to what is now called forensic linguistics. This motivated a new Division of forensic linguistics called Criminal Profiling in Law Enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=243839|title=Marcos, en la mira de Zedillo - Proceso|date=5 August 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://enlineadirecta.info/?option=view&amp;article=12183«Marcos Sí es Sebastián Guillén»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzos.com.mx/images/pdf/buzos195.pdf«La Otra Campana Pintada de Azul»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&amp;a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&amp;rl=wh« Maestros y condiscípulos de Tampico recuerdan a Rafael Guillén»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguistic evidence also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 disappearance of Julie Turner, a 40-year-old woman living in [[Yorkshire]]. After she was reported missing, her partner received several [[text message]]s from Julie's mobile phone, such as "Stopping at jills, back later need to sort my head out", and "Tell kids not to worry. sorting my life out. (sic) be in touch to get some things".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/science/12file-text.html Speech Patterns in Messages Betray a Killer], Elizabeth Svoboda, ''[[New York Times]]'' May 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators found that letters written by Turner's friend Howard Simmerson shared several unusual orthographic and punctuation features with the text messages, suggesting that Simmerson had been aware of the contents of the messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197187/Dear-Garry-Ive-decided-end-The-stop-trapped-killer.html Dear Garry.

19-year old [[Murder of Jenny Nicholl|Jenny Nicholl]] disappeared on 30 June 2005. [[Murder conviction without a body|Her body was never found]], giving police and forensic scientists little information to go on about what might have happened to Jenny. After looking through her phone for clues, forensic linguists came to the conclusion that the texts sent from her phone around the time that she disappeared seemed very different than her usual texting style, and soon started looking to her ex-boyfriend, David Hodgson, for clues of what happened to her, including looking through his phone and studying his texting style. The forensic linguists found a number of stylistic similarities between David's texting style and the messages sent from Jenny's phone around the time she went missing. Using the timeframe of when she went missing, combined with the differences in texting styles and other forensic details, Jenny's [[Murder|murderer]], David Hodgson, was convicted. The analysis of the text messages and their submission in court helped to pave the way for forensic linguistics to be acknowledged as a science in UK law, rather than opinion. To this day, her body has not been found, but justice was still served for her and her family because of forensic linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Elizabeth|title=The case for forensic linguistics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7600769.stm|work=BBC News|date=8 September 2008|access-date=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic linguist John Olsson gave evidence in a murder trial on the meaning of 'jooking' in connection with a stabbing.&lt;ref&gt;Trial of Rehan Asghar, Central Criminal Court, London, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the appeal against the conviction of the [[Bridgewater Four]], the forensic linguist examined the written confession of Patrick Molloy, one of the defendants&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a confession which he had retracted immediately&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and a written record of an interview which the police claimed took place immediately before the confession was dictated. Molloy denied that the interview had ever taken place, and the analysis indicated that the answers in the interview were not consistent with the questions being asked. The linguist came to the conclusion that the interview had been fabricated by police. The conviction against the Bridgewater Four was quashed before the linguist in the case, Malcolm Coulthard, could produce his evidence.

In an Australian case reported by Eagleson, a "farewell letter" had apparently been written by a woman prior to her disappearance. The letter was compared with a sample of her previous writing and that of her husband. Eagleson came to the conclusion that the letter had been written by the husband of the missing woman, who subsequently confessed to having written it and to having killed his wife. The features analysed included sentence breaks, [[markedness|marked]] [[Thematic relation|themes]], and deletion of [[preposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleson, Robert. (1994). 'Forensic analysis of personal written texts: a case study', John Gibbons (ed.), ''Language and the Law'', London: Longman, 362&amp;ndash;373.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there was a horrible house fire where a father was able to save his children, but his wife died in the house. The police thought that the fire was actually not an accident, but instead was a cover-up of the father murdering the mother. The forensic linguists were able to obtain the phone of both the father and mother, and realized that there were texts still being sent from the mother's phone the whole day – long after the police thought she had died. Using information from the two phones, the linguists were able to study the texting styles of both parents to see if they could obtain any more information about what happened that day. It turned out that the texts sent from the wife's phone were actually the husband pretending to be the wife so that no one would know she was murdered, and everyone would believe that she perished in the house fire. The forensic linguists were able to figure this out by studying the husband's texting style, spelling errors, and more, and were able to come to the conclusion that the texts sent after the wife was thought to be deceased, was actually the husband texting off her phone pretending to be her. Without this knowledge, it would have been much more difficult to convict the husband of [[Murder|murder]] and get justice for the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yvxmbk/forensic-linguists-use-spelling-mistakes-to-help-convict-criminals|title=Forensic Linguists Use Spelling Mistakes to Help Convict Criminals|date=9 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional concepts==

===Linguistic fingerprinting===
A linguistic fingerprint is a concept put forward by some scholars that each human being uses language differently, and that this difference between people involves a collection of markers which stamps a speaker/writer as unique; similar to a fingerprint. Under this view, it is assumed that every individual uses languages differently and this difference can be observed as a fingerprint.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;  It is formed as a result of merged language style. A person's linguistic fingerprint can be reconstructed from the individual's daily interactions and relate to a variety of self-reported personality characteristics, situational variables and physiological markers (e.g. blood pressure, cortisol, testosterone).&lt;ref&gt;Pennebaker, J. W. (1990). 'Physiological factors influencing the reporting of physical symptoms'. ''The Science of Self-report: Implications for Research and Practice.'' Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum Publishers, pp. 299-316&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of an investigation, the emphasis should be on the relative rather than absolute difference between the authors and how investigators can classify their texts. John Olsson, however, argues that although the concept of linguistic fingerprinting is attractive to law enforcement agencies, there is so far little hard evidence to support the notion.&lt;ref name="Olsson:2008" /&gt;

===Variation===
Intra-author variations are the ways in which one author's texts differ from each other. Inter-author variations are the ways in which different authors' writing varies. Two texts by one author do not necessarily vary less than texts by two different authors.
*'''Genre:''' When texts are being measured in different genres, considerable variation is observed even though they are by the same author.
*'''Text Type:''' Personal letters contain more inter-relationship bonding strategies than academic articles or term papers.
*'''Fiction vs. Non-Fiction:''' Some fiction writers are journalists. Due to the different demands of each medium, they can be completely different from one another and this results in intra-author variation.
*'''Private vs Public:''' A politician writing a political speech, which is a public text,  will differ greatly from a private text to a friend or family member.
*'''Time lapse:''' The greater the time lapse between two works, the greater the likely variation. Language changes more than we realize in a relatively short span of time, influencing our susceptibility to language changes around us.
*'''Disguise:''' A writer can publish pseudonymously or anonymously, disguising output to prevent recognition.

===Forensic transcription===
The two main types of transcriptions are written documents and video and audio records. Accurate, reliable text transcription is important because the text is the data which becomes the available evidence. If a transcription is wrong, the evidence is altered. If there is failure to transcribe the full text, evidence is once again altered unwittingly. There must be emphasis on the text being the evidence. A transcription of an audio file should never be assumed to be completely accurate. Each type of transcription contains its own problems. A handwritten document might contain unusual spellings which may result in ambiguous meanings, illegible handwriting and illustrations that are difficult to comprehend. A scanned document is tricky, as it may alter the original document. Audio and video documents can include repetitions, hesitation, nonsensical talk, jargon which can be hard to understand and speakers mumbling incoherently and inaudibly. Non-linguistic sounds such as crying and laughing may also be included in the audio and video text which cannot be transcribed easily.  Because of this, civil libertarians argued that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded and the recordings kept, as well as transcribed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/15/opinion/recording-police-questioning.html | work=The New York Times | title=Recording Police Questioning | date=15 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13731">'''Genre criticism''', a method within [[rhetorical criticism]], analyzes texts in terms of their genre: the set of generic expectations, conventions, and constraints that guide their production and interpretation. In [[rhetoric]], the theory of [[genre]] provides a means to classify and compare artifacts in terms of their formal, substantive and contextual features. By grouping artifacts with others which have similar formal features or rhetorical exigencies, rhetorical critics can shed light on how authors use or flout conventions for their own purposes. Genre criticism has thus become one of the main methodologies within rhetorical criticism. 

Literary critics have used the concepts of genres to classify speeches and works of literature since the time of [[Aristotle]], who distinguished three rhetorical genres: the [[Forensic rhetoric | legal or judicial]], the [[Deliberative rhetoric | deliberative]] or political, and the ceremonial or [[epideictic]].  Since then, rhetorical approaches to genre and understanding of the term "genre" have evolved in several ways. New genres have been studied for their rhetorical effectiveness - like sermons, letters, and (more recently) non-verbal genres like political cartoons, film, and public monuments.  Further contemporary genre criticism has revised understanding of genre in several ways. The first [[turn (disambiguation) | turn]], represented by [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin]] (1895-1975), among others, focused on the formal features of communication. The second turn, represented by Carolyn Miller, among others, focused on recurring socio-cultural circumstances. In the latest turn, critics have begun applying formalist and socio-cultural concepts to [[new media | new-media]] artifacts that tend to resist classification into traditional genre-categories.

== Emphasis on formal features in speech genres==
The first group of rhetorical critics, following the example of theorists like [[M. M. Bakhtin]], used formal features to analyze texts. For these critics, language is formed through a series of utterances that reflect specific conditions and goals of certain linguistic aspects. These aspects include thematic content, style, and compositional structure which form speech genres. Speech genres are diverse because of the various possibilities of human activity. In "The Problem of Speech Genres" (1986), Mikhail Bakhtin draws attention to the very significant difference between primary (simple) and secondary (complex) speech genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, M. M. (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LO_agE_GTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Problem of Speech Genres"]. ''Speech genres and other late essays''. Trans. V. W. McGee. University of Texas Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bahktin, primary speech genres form secondary speech genres and examples of secondary speech genres include novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, and major genres of commentary. Since these secondary genres involve complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication that is artistic and scientific, they absorb and digest various primary genres that have taken form in mediated speech communion. Bakhtin continues to explain that there are three factors of the whole utterance which include semantic exhaustiveness of the theme, the speaker’s plan or speech will, and the typical compositional and generic forms of finalization.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; The first factor refers to the way utterances are used within speech which is linked to the second factor of how the speaker determines to use the utterance.The third factor explains that all our utterances have definite and stable typical forms of construction, but that these forms can change when needed. As Bahktin writes, "These genres are so diverse because they differ depending on the situation, social position, and personal interrelations of the participants in the communication".&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical approaches to genre==
The word “[[genre]]” is derived from the [[Latin]] term ''genus'', to mean “kind”, “class” or "sort".

[[Aristotle]] was one of the first scholars to develop a rhetorical approach to genre. He divided the art of rhetoric into three genres: [[deliberative]], [[forensic]], and [[epideictic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, F.I (1995). "The Rhetoric of Aristotle". ''A Synoptic History of Classical Rhetoric'' (2nd rev. ed.), Davis, CA. Hermagoras Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberative genre of rhetoric involves speeches or writing meant to persuade an audience to take action. Deliberative rhetoric thus includes rhetoric that is used for political persuasion, discusses matters of public policy in order to determine what is advantageous or disadvantageous, and is usually concerned with the future. Rhetoric of the [[forensic]] genre questions guilt or innocence, is concerned with legalities, and concentrates on events that occurred in the past. The [[epideictic]] genre of rhetoric encompasses all rhetoric used for ceremonial and commemorative purposes. Epideictic rhetoric praises and blames, acknowledging that which is noble or shameful, honorable or dishonorable. 

The [[rhetorical situation]] is a concept important for understanding rhetorical approaches to genre and the creation of new genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L.F. (1968). "The rhetorical situation". ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'', vol. 1, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign speeches are an example of how rhetorical situations recur, producing sedimented genres. As a result of the institutions that execute the [[U.S. Constitution]], every four years at the time of presidential elections, candidates deliver campaign speeches. Campaign speeches have become a distinct genre because they respond to highly similar situations that recur because of a structural or institutional basis.

U.S. rhetoricians [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] and [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] refer to genre as a “constellation of elements."&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"&gt;Karlyn Kohrs Campbell and Kathleen Hall Jamieson (1978), ''Form and Genre: Shaping Rhetorical Action''. The Speech Communication Association. Falls Church, VA. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They say, “A genre is a group of acts unified by a constellation of forms that recurs in each of its members.” Genres are formed when examined constituents are similar. The metaphors of genres as “constellations” serves to explain how genres, like constellations of stars, are constructed of individual members, but are under the influence of each other and outside elements. As a result they move together and remain in a similar relation to each other despite their ever-changing positions.&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt; According to Campbell and Jamieson, “when a generic claim is made, the critical situation alters significantly because the critic is now arguing that a group of discourses has a synthetic core in which certain significant rhetorical elements, e.g., a system of belief, lines of argument, stylistic choices, and the perception of the situation, are fused into an indivisible whole".&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt;

Many contemporary scholars refer to the fusion of traits from different genres in speeches and texts as a "generic [[Hybrid genre|hybrid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, K.M.; Campbell, K.K. (1982). "Rhetorical hybrids: "'Fusion of generic elements'". ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (68), pp. 146-157.&lt;/ref&gt; These generic hybrids can be formed from a blend of the three rhetorical genres.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', (Trans. W.R. Roberts, 1954), New York: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be explained through an example of a generic hybrid of deliberative and epideictic elements, in which a newly elected President delivers an inaugural address. The President is speaking at a formal ceremony recognizing the current state of the nation (characteristic of the epideictic genre), while simultaneously announcing his policy plans for the upcoming four years. 

U.S. rhetorician Carolyn R. Miller is the author of the article "Genre as Social Action" (1984). She argues, “Rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish.” &lt;ref name="Miller 1984"&gt; Miller, C. R. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (70), pp. 151-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also argues that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional, written genres. She is among other rhetoricians who have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. They argue that because genre theory originally was developed for describing written texts, the theory should be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Miller and colleague Dawn Shepherd illustrate an example of applying socio-cultural theories to genre studies in "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog". They explain how the weblog may be establishing a new genre because of its integration of current social and cultural trends.&lt;ref name ="blogging"&gt;Miller, C. R.; Shepherd, D.(2004). [http://blog.lib.umn.edu/blogosphere/blogging_as_social_action.html "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog"], Into the Blogosphere. Retrieved 10 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-cultural approach to genre studies==
In the 1980s, scholarship in genre theory and criticism has turned towards a socio-cultural approach to the study of genre by actively interrogating the rhetorical situation of a given communication artifact in light of its particular generic form. In this mode of inquiry, the rhetorical artifact is examined as a social response to a set of recurrent rhetorical exigencies rather than a collection of formal, generic elements. In the rhetorical tradition of genre criticism, Carolyn R. Miller's work on the socio-cultural approach to genre theory has been influential. Again in her 1984 journal article, Miller argues that “rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and that a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish”.&lt;ref name="Miller 1984"/&gt; Later, when Miller and Shepherd engaged the socio-cultural approach to genre criticism in “Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog” (2004), they exposed some of the difficulties of applying genre theory to new media. In their analysis, Miller and Shepherd examine the extent to which the weblog might constitute a genre in light of its interaction with current social and cultural trends.

==Genres studies in new media==
Recently scholars and researchers in [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], and [[information sciences]] have begun to explore the relationships between new media and socio-contextual genre theories (like those of Carolyn Miller, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Charles Bazerman). These researchers have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. Some scholars have argued that since genre theory was originally developed to describe written texts, the theory needs to be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Linguist and semiotician Gunter Kress suggested that much of the vocabulary of generic analysis is ill-equipped to address non-written communication, arguing that “there are no genre terms for describing what [a] drawing is or does…” &lt;ref&gt;Kress, G. &amp; Van Leeuwen, T (1996). ''Multimodal Discourse''. London: Routledge. p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, rhetoricians Miller and Shepherd have argued that traditional written genre theory does not appropriately address the visual features of a genre’s format.&lt;ref name="blogging"/&gt;

Rhetoricians and [[Information science|information scientists]] have also pointed out that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional written genres. The authors of the article "Genres and the web" argue that the personal home page is functioning as a new and discrete genre, and they explore the entirely digital nature of home pages, suggesting that home pages “have no obvious paper equivalent”.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Andrew; Gushrowski, Barbara A. (2000). "Genres and the web: Is the personal home page the first uniquely digital genre?" ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science]]'', 51(2), pp. 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally recent work in new media genre theory has explored how new communication technologies allows for forms of “genre [[hybridity]].” Spinuzzi, for example, explores what can happen when multiple related genres are [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediated]] into a single new media artifact.&lt;ref name="Clay Spinuzzi 2003"&gt;Spinuzzi, C. (2003). ''Tracing genres through organizations: A sociocultural approach to information design''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Idalaka''' is a [[dialect chain]] spoken in [[East Timor]]. The dialects are spoken in the [[Ramelau]] mountains with the exception of endangered Lolein, which is spoken in Dili.  Idalaka resembles the [[Kemak language]] in that there are archaic features such as personal prefixes in verbs. Idalaka is one of 15 recognized national languages of East Timor. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of Idaté and Lakalai.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14100">{{other uses|Intermission (disambiguation)}}
An '''intermission''', also known as an '''interval''' in British and Indian English, is a recess between parts of a [[performance]] or production, such as for a [[play (theatre)|theatrical play]], [[opera]], [[concert]], or [[film screening]]. It should not be confused with an [[entr'acte]] (French: "between acts"), which, in the 18th century, was a sung, danced, spoken, or musical performance that occurs between any two acts, that is unrelated to the main performance, and that thus in the world of opera and [[musical theatre]] became an orchestral performance that spans an intermission and leads, without a break, into the next act.{{sfn|Charlton|1986|p=128}}

[[Jean-François Marmontel]] and [[Denis Diderot]] both viewed the intermission as a period in which the action did not in fact stop, but continued off-stage. "The interval is a rest for the spectators; not for the action," wrote Marmontel in 1763. "The characters are deemed to continue acting during the interval from one act to another." However, intermissions are more than just dramatic pauses that are parts of the shape of a dramatic structure. They also exist for more mundane reasons, such as that it is hard for audience members to concentrate for more than two hours at a stretch, and actors and performers (for live action performances at any rate) need to rest.{{sfn|Pavis|Shantz|1998|p=187}}{{sfn|Andrews|2011|p=59}} They afford opportunity for scene and costume changes.{{sfn|Goodridge|1999|p=85}} Performance venues take advantage of them to sell food and drink.{{sfn|Goodridge|1999|p=85}}

Psychologically, intermissions allow audiences to pause their [[suspension of disbelief]] and return to reality, and are a period during which they can engage critical faculties that they have suspended during the performance itself.{{sfn|Pavis|Shantz|1998|p=187}}{{sfn|Goodridge|1999|p=85}}

== Plays ==
The term "Broadway Bladder" names "the alleged need of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] audience to urinate every 75 minutes".{{sfn|Holland|1997|p=3}} Broadway Bladder, and other considerations (such as how much revenue a theatre would lose at its bar if there were no intermissions), govern the placement of intermissions within performances, and their existence in performances, such as plays, that were not written/created with intermissions in mind.{{sfn|Holland|1997|p=3}}

=== William Shakespeare ===
The plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were originally intended for theatre performance without intermissions.  The placement of intermissions within those plays in modern performances is thus a matter for the play's director.{{sfn|Dessen|2002|p=95}}  Reviewer Peter Holland analysed the placement of intermissions in 1997:
* Of ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' he noted that there was "as natural a break as anyone could wish for" before the speech of Time as Chorus, and that he had never seen a production that placed an intermission other than at that point.{{sfn|Holland|1997|p=3}}
* [[Trevor Nunn]]'s production of ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' in 1991 is given as an example of intermissions placed in the middle of a scene.  It stopped halfway through act 3 scene 1, moving some of the lines from later in the scene to before the intermission.{{sfn|Holland|1997|p=3}}
* Performances of ''[[King Lear]]'', he observed, often place the intermission "disproportionately late", after the blinding of Gloucester.{{sfn|Holland|1997|p=3}}
* The 1991 RSC production of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' directed by [[Stephen Pimlott]] is pointed out as noteworthy for its extraordinary intermission length. Pimlott had placed the intermission after act 4 scene 1, after the action leaves Rome. This allowed the striking of the scenery. But it took sometimes as much as forty minutes for stage crew to remove the scenery, which comprised a "massive set of columns and a doorway" designed by [[Tobias Hoheisel]], a period that was longer than the remaining length of the performance, some thirty-five minutes.{{sfn|Holland|1997|p=4}}

Many modern productions of Shakespeare plays have thus eschewed the introduction of an intermission, choosing instead to perform them straight through, as originally intended.{{sfn|Dessen|2002|p=95}}

=== Kabuki ===
The intermissions in [[Kabuki]] theatre can last up to an hour.  Because this often results in people returning to their seats several minutes after the performance has resumed, playwrights generally take to writing "filler" scenes for the starts of acts, containing characters and dialogue that are not important to the overall story.{{sfn|Brandon|1992|p=29}}

== Films ==
Intermissions in early films had a practical purpose: they were needed to facilitate the changing of [[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cliftextheatre.com/history.htm |title=History: Intermission |publisher=Cliftex: Texas' Oldest, Continuously Operating Movie Theatre |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201183644/http://www.cliftextheatre.com/history.htm |archivedate=February 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth]]'' (''The Loves of Queen Elizabeth''), starring [[Sarah Bernhardt]], opened on July 12, 1912, in the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] in [[New York City]], the four reel film was shown in four acts, with an intermission at each reel change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemasightlines.com/showmanship_roadshow.php |title=The Roadshow Era |publisher=Cinema Sightlines |accessdate=May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology improved, but as movies became progressively longer, the intermission fulfilled other needs. It gave the audience a breather, and provided the theatre management an opportunity to entice patrons to its profitable [[concession stand]]. A 1957 animated musical [[Snipe (theatrical)|snipe]] suggested, before the main feature in theatres and during intermission at [[Drive-in theater|drive-ins]], "[[Let's All Go to the Lobby|let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat]]".  And during the [[3D film]] golden era of the early 1950s, intermissions were a necessity because even though many theaters used two projectors that could skip intermission by shifting from one reel to the other, 3D films required the use of both projectors - one for each stereoscopic image - and so needed an intermission to change the reels on both projectors.

The built-in intermission has been phased out of Hollywood films; the victim of the demand to pack in more screenings, advances in projector technology which make reel switches either unnoticeable or non-existent (such as [[Digital cinema|digital projection]], in which reels do not exist).&lt;ref name=SFC&gt;{{cite news |title=Longer movies, bigger drinks and no intermissions equal a new kind of epic struggle in the theater: one bowl to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them |author=Peter Hartlaub |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=December 19, 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/12/19/DDG353NNMT32.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian cinema ===
Despite the phasing out of intermissions in the West, they have remained prevalent in India, and especially with [[Bollywood]] films. There is a mass reluctance to abolish intermissions as they bring a large revenue to cinemas through customers buying snacks during these periods. Indian films are also typically longer compared to films from other parts of the world. In 2011, a Bollywood film, ''[[Dhobi Ghat (film)|Dhobi Ghat]]'', was released without an intermission and was cited as a first in Indian cinema. Forced intermissions are common during screenings of western films in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma|title=Do we need the intermission?|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/news-interviews/28369961_1_interval-bollywood-movies-hindi-movies|publisher=THE TIMES OF INDIA|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steph|title=Intermission|url=http://www.20yearshence.com/intermission/|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood films shown in cinemas in the [[United Kingdom]] also commonly include intermissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Movies UK|url=http://www.fmuk.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=17195&amp;p=208115|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Bollywood films released on DVD include the "intermission" card for cinematic screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blase|title=Music paste up: MIA and terrifying things to do with cars, Clean Bandit provide some local sauce, and the dance film season is upon us|url=http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2012/04/music_paste_up_10|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keiese''' is an [[Austronesian]] language spoken in a small region of the [[Moluccas]], a province of [[Indonesia]].

==Geography==
Keiese is mainly spoken in the [[Kai Islands|Kei]] archipelago in [[Maluku Tenggara]] (The Southeast Moluccas), belonging to the province of [[Maluku, Indonesia]]. It has a population of around 140.000 people (source unknown), half of which lives in the only two cities, [[Tual, Indonesia|Tual]] and [[Langgur]]: respectively the [[Islamic]] and [[Christian]] capitals of the archipelago. Both cities belong to the [[Kei Kecil]] district. The other half of the population lives in the coastal villages of the archipelago.

==Classification==
Keiese is an [[Austronesian]] language, traditionally grouped in the [[Central Malayo-Polynesian]] (CMP) language family that knows several subgroups, one of which is Kei-Tanimbar. This tiny family splits up one more time into Yamdena-Onin and Kei-Fordata, the latter of which contains Keiese. The main dialects are the Northern and Southern Mainland dialects, spoken on Kei Besar, and the Islands Dialect, spoken on the other islands. The Islands Dialect has some sub dialects, of which the Kei Kecil dialect has the most speakers and prestige. All grammatical descriptions in this article are derived from the Kei Kecil dialect.

==Name==
Keiese is referred to with different names derived from at least three backgrounds. “Kei” is assumed to be coined by Portuguese colonists. They called it stone (“kayos”) for its rocky bottom. However, whereas the most inhabited island (Kei Kecil) is indeed a rocky atoll, the biggest island of the archipelago ([[Kei Besar]]) is a fertile volcanic island. Dutch missionaries would call the language “Keiees” (lit. “Keiese”). Indonesians know the language today, as “Bahasa Kei/Kai”, always pronounced as [ke]. Ethnologue mentions a second way to refer to the language: “Saumlaki”. Saumlaki is a small island that belongs to the [[Tanimbar]] archipelago, of which its languages are not proven to be directly historically related to Kei. The third way to talk about the language is in the language itself. The pronunciation is best transcribed as [eʋa:v], which cannot be translated for simply being a proper name. Spellings that are used by scholars are Eiwav, Eivav, Ewaw, Ewab, Ewaf, Evav, Ewav and Evaf, for it is arguable whether the two consonants are phonemically distinct or not.

==Status==
It is difficult to estimate the number of speakers of Keiese. According to Ethnologue, the number lies around 85,000, out of a total of 140,000 inhabitants. In 1985, Tetelepta et al. write that the total number of Keiese speakers in the two capitals of Kei Kecil and the capital of Kei Besar was 12,353 people. It is likely that this number must be doubled when including the speakers in coastal villages. Ma Kang Yuen&lt;ref&gt;Yuen, M.K. (Felix Ma). 2012. Kamus Bahasa Kei – Indonesia [Dictionary Kei – Indonesian].&lt;/ref&gt; however, who studied the language in 154 villages (out of a bit more than 200) on Kei Kecil for several years in the first decade of the 21st century, claims to have never met a fluent speaker. This was later confirmed by Yuri Villa Rikkers,&lt;ref&gt;Villa Rikkers, Y. 2014. Topics in Evaf Morphology: a Comparative Analysis of Inflectional Categories in an Austronesian Language of the Southeast Moluccas. Universiteit Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt; who visited the archipelago for a brief linguistic study in 2014.

==Linguistic features==

===Phonology===
Keiese knows approximately 16 [[consonants]], 8 [[vowels]] and 4 [[diphthong]]s. The Keiese people have not yet concluded on an official spelling system.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! [[Consonants]] !! !! [[Vowels]] and [[Diphthong]]s !!
|-
! [[Phoneme]] !! [[Allophones]] !! [[Phoneme]] !! [[Allophones]]
|-
| /b/ || [b] || /i/ || [i], [ɪ], [ə]
|-
| /t/ || [t] || /u/ || [u]
|-

|-
| /s/ || [s]
|-
| /j/ || [j]
|-
| /w/ || [w]
|-
| /l/ || [l]
|}

As is common among Austronesian languages, consonant clusters are usually avoided. [[Word stress]] is usually found on the last [[syllable]].

===Verbal inflection===
Verbal [[Inflection]] in Keiese is about [[grammatical agreement|agreement]] marking on the verb, based on the [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] of the [[grammatical subject|subject]] of a sentence. These subjects may be formed by [[nouns]] or by free [[personal pronouns]] that know a [[clusivity]] distinction as is common in Austronesian languages.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Person/number !! Pronoun !! Person/number !! Pronoun
|-
| 1SG || ''jaʔau'' || 1PL (inclusive)|| ''it''
|-
| 2SG || ''ɔ'' || 2PL || ''im''
|-
| 3SG || ''i'' || 3PL || ''hir''
|-
| 1PL (exclusive) || ''am'' || || 
|}

They each correspond to a verbal [[prefix]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Person/number !! Prefix!! Person/number !! Prefix
|-
| 1SG || ''u-'' || 1PL (inclusive)|| ''t-''
|-
| 2SG || ''m-'' || 2PL || ''m-''

The sentences below (Villa Rikkers, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;Villa Rikkers, Y. 2014. Topics in Evaf Morphology: a Comparative Analysis of Inflectional Categories in an Austronesian Language of the Southeast Moluccas. Universiteit Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt; show how these forms combine.

'''First person singular'''
 ''jɑʔau	u-	baŋil	umɑt	hoɑrrəbran	 vut-	ru	ma      umɛɑk''
 1SG	1SG	hit	person  husband:3PL.POSS ten	two	ADDR	shy
 “So I  hit twenty shy husbands.”	

'''Second person singular'''
 ''o m-  fɪd	i   ni	     wɑrat waid''
 2SG 2SG  sell	3SG 3SG.POSS rope  NEG
 “You don’t sell his rope.”

'''Third person singular'''
 ''i  ʔn-  ba ʔn-	tun	manut	insjɛn	ʔntɪl''	
  3SG  3SG-  go 3SG	shoot	chicken	lazy	three	
 “He’s going to shoot three lazy chickens again.”	

'''First person plural (addressee excluded)'''
 ''ɑm	bɪsbisa	m-	fɔklɔi	lar	jaʔanuŋ''
 1PL.EX	all	1PL.EX-	hang	sail	1SG.POSS
 “So we(excl.) hang my sail.”

'''Second person plural'''
 ''im	m-	ŋis	bəlabɑ	bərbir	ʔnru''	
 2PL	2PL	pinch	spider	blue	two
 “You   pinch two blue spiders.”

'''Third person plural'''
 ''hir	ʔr-	foi	ŋunit	kətkut		ʔntɪl	məhɛ''
 3PL	3PL	plant	bamboo	short		three	 only
 “They only  plant three small bamboo plants.”

===Possession===
Keiese discriminates between alienable and unalienable nouns by using different strategies to express possession. Alienable nouns select possessive pronouns.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Person/number !! Prefix!! Person/number !! Prefix
|-
| 1SG || ''nɪŋ~(a)nuŋ'' || 1PL (inclusive)|| ''did~din''
|-
| 2SG || ''mu'' || 2PL || ''bir''
|-
| 3SG || ''ni'' || 3PL || ''rir''
|-
| 1PL (exclusive) || ''mam' || || 
|}

For example, "my boat" must be translated as "nɪŋ habo", for boats may have different owners at different times. Unalienable nouns select possessive suffixes.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Person/number !! Suffix !! Example !! Meaning
|-
| 1SG || ''-ŋ'' || ''limaŋ'' || "my hand"
|-
| 2SG || ''-m'' || ''limam'' || "your hand"
|-
| 3SG || ''-n'' || ''liman'' || "the/its/him/her hand"
|-
| 1PL (exclusive) || ''-b'' || ''limab'' || "our hand" (ex.)
|-
| 1PL (inclusive)|| ''-d'' || ''limad'' || "our hand" (in.)
|-
| 2PL || ''-b'' || ''limab'' || "your hand"
|-
| 3PL || ''-r'' || ''limar'' || "their hand"
|}

===Numerals===
The numeral system uses numeral roots (NR) that combine with both numeral classifiers (CLF) and autonomous numerals (NUM). The numeral roots are given below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Root !! Meaning !! Root !! Meaning
|-
| ''ain'' || "one" || ''nean~nɛan~nɛ:n'' || "six"
|-
| ''ru'' || "two" || ''fit~fid'' || "seven"
|-
| ''til~tɪl~tel'' || "three" || ''ʋau~wau'' || "eight"
|-
| ''fak~fa:k'' || "four" || ''siw'' || "nine"
|-
| ''lim~lɪm'' || "five" || || 
|}

The formation of numbers is illustrated in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Range !! Structure !! Illustration !! Meaning
|-
| 1|| CLF-(NUM) || ''ain(mehe)'' || 1
|-
| 2-9|| CLF-NR || ''ainru'' || 2

'''Kĕnaboi''' is an extinct unclassified language of [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaysia]] that may be a [[language isolate]] or an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language belonging to the [[Aslian languages|Aslian]] branch. It is attested in what appear to be two dialects,[http://multitree.linguistlist.org/codes/0m1-kdo][http://multitree.linguistlist.org/codes/0m1-kdt] based on two word lists of about 250 lexical items collected around 1880 by D.F.A. Hervey that are cited in Blagden (1906).

==Locations==
Around 1880, Hervey collected his Kenaboi lexicon in [[Alor Gajah]], [[Melaka]] from speakers living in Gunung Dato', [[Rembau District]], which is a small inland mountainous area in southern [[Negeri Sembilan]]. Based on the ethnonym, the Kenaboi may have originated from the Kenaboi River valley of [[Jelebu District]], northern Negeri Sembilan (Hajek 1998). Today, the [[Orang Asli]] of Negeri Sembilan are primarily [[Temuan language|Temuan]] speakers.

==Classification==
Hajek (1998)&lt;ref name="Hajek1998"&gt;Hajek, John. 1998. "[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/hajek1998kenaboi.pdf Kenaboi: An extinct unclassified language of the Malay Peninsula]." ''Mon–Khmer Studies: A Journal of Southeast Languages'' 28: 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that Kenaboi is a mixed language of both [[Aslian languages|Aslian]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] origins, with Kenaboi (dialect 1) having a higher proportion of Austroasiatic words than Kenaboi (dialect 2). Kenaboi (dialect 1) also has many words of unknown origin, such as ''mambu'' 'white' and ''par'' 'water'. Hajek (1998) speculates that the lexical aberrancy of Kenaboi 1 may due to the fact that Kenaboi 1 was a special [[argot|taboo language]], while Kenaboi 2 was the regular non-taboo language. The lexicon of Kenaboi 1 is 47% Austroasiatic, 27% Austronesian, and 26% unclassified out of a total of 216 words.&lt;ref name="Hajek1998"/&gt;

Hammarström, et al.&lt;ref&gt;http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/kena1236&lt;/ref&gt; note in [[Glottolog]] that Kenaboi is best considered to be a [[language isolate]], and do not consider arguments of Kenaboi as a taboo-jargon ([[argot]]) to be convincing. Blagden (1906) considers Kenaboi as an isolate unrelated to Austroasiatic and Austronesian.

Rasa, another extinct language documented in Skeat &amp; Blagden (1906) near Rasa in [[Ulu Selangor]], also has many words of uncertain origin (Phillips 2012: 257-258).&lt;ref name="Phillips2012"&gt;Phillips, Timothy C. 2012. ''Proto-Aslian: towards an understanding of its historical linguistic systems, principles and processes''. Ph.D. thesis, Institut Alam Dan Tamadun Melayu Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kichwa''' (''Kichwa shimi,'' ''Runashimi,'' also [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Quichua'') is a [[Quechuan languages|Quechuan language]] that includes all Quechua varieties of [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]] (''[[Inga Kichwa|Inga]]''), as well as extensions into [[Peru]]. It has an estimated 1,000,000 speakers. 

The most widely spoken dialects are Chimborazo Highland and Imbabura Highland Kichwa, with 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 speakers.&lt;!--How can there be more speakers of the dialects than the language? What does that even mean? Sounds as if two sources were used without reconciliation.--&gt; Cañar Highland Quechua has 100,000–200,000 speakers; the other dialects have from 10,000 to 20,000 speakers each. Kichwa belongs to the [[Northern Quechua]] group of [[Quechua II]], according to linguist [[Alfredo Torero]].

==Overview==
Kichwa syntax has undergone some grammatical simplification compared to [[Southern Quechua]], perhaps because of partial creolization with the pre-Inca languages of Ecuador.

A standardized language, with a unified orthography (Kichwa Unificado, ''Shukyachiska Kichwa''), has been developed. It is similar to Chimborazo but lacks some of the phonological peculiarities of that dialect.

The earliest grammatical description of Kichwa was written in the 17th century by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest Hernando de Alcocer.&lt;ref&gt;Ciucci, Luca &amp; Pieter C. Muysken 2011. ''Hernando de Alcocer y la Breve declaración del Arte de la lengua del Ynga. El más antiguo manuscrito de quichua de Ecuador.'' Indiana 28: 359-393.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First efforts for language standardization and bilingual education===

According to linguist Arturo Muyulema, the first steps to teach Kichwa in public schools dates to the 1940s, when Dolores Cacuango founded several indigenous schools in [[Cayambe (canton)|Cayambe]]. Later, indigenous organizations initiated self-governed schools to provide education in Kichwa in the 1970s and 1980s (Muyulema 2011:234). 

Muyulema says that the creation of literary pieces such as "Caimi Ňucanchic Shimuyu-Panca", "Ňucanchic Llactapac Shimi," "Ňucanchic Causaimanta Yachaicuna," and " Antisuyu-Punasuyu" provided the catalysts for the standardization of Kichwa language. This was initiated by DINEIB (National Board of Intercultural Bilingual Education).&lt;ref&gt;(Muyulema 2011:234)&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward a new alphabet was created by ALKI (Kichwan Language Academy). It comprises 21 characters; including three vowels (a, i, u); two semi-vowels (w, y); and 16 consonants (ch, h, k, l, ll, m, n, ñ, p, r, s, sh, t, ts, z, zh), according to Muyulema's article "Presente y Futuro de la lengua Quichua desde la perspectiva de la experiencia vasca (Kichwa sisariy ňan)" (Muyulema 2011:234).

Later, the bigger and much more comprehensive dictionary ''Kichwa Yachakukkunapa Shimiyuk Kamu'' was published in 2009 by the linguist Fabián Potosí, in conjunction with other scholars sponsored by the Ministry of Education of Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;(Muyulema 2011:234-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Laura Resau's book, The Queen of Water, a true story about the main character, Maria Virginia Farinango, mentions the language. Virginia is an Ecuadorian indigena born into a poor family, speaking Quichwa. Virginia is sold to a wealthy mestizo family, who are abusive. She learns Spanish, and eventually forgets most of her home tongue. Please read the book to learn more about Virginia and her language.

==Characteristics==

In contrast to other regional varieties of Quechua, Kichwa does not distinguish between the original ("Proto Quechua") {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/q/}}, which are both pronounced {{IPA|[k]}}. {{IPA|[e]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}, the [[allophone]]s of the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} near {{IPA|/q/}}, do not exist. ''Kiru'' can mean both "tooth" (''kiru'' in [[Southern Quechua]]) and "wood" (''qiru'' {{IPA|[qero]}} in Southern Quechua), and ''killa'' can mean both "moon" (''killa'') and "lazy" (''qilla'' {{IPA|[qeʎa]}}).

Additionally, Kichwa in both Ecuador and Colombia has lost possessive and bidirectional suffixes (verbal suffixes indicating both subject and object), as well as the distinction between the exclusive and inclusive first person plural:

*Instead of ''yayayku / taytayku'' ("Our Father", the Lord's Prayer) Kichwa people say ''ñukanchik yaya / ñukanchik tayta.''
*In Kichwa, you do not say ''suyayki'' ("I wait for you"), but ''kanta shuyani.''

On the other hand, other particularities of Quechua have been preserved. As in all Quechuan languages, the words for 'brother' and 'sister' differ depending on to whom they refer. There are four different words for siblings: ''ñaña'' (sister of a woman), ''turi'' (brother of a woman), ''pani'' (sister of a man), and ''wawki'' (brother of a man). A woman reading "Ñuka wawki Pedromi kan" would read aloud ''Ñuka turi Pedromi kan''.

==Dialects==

The missionary organization FEDEPI (2006) lists eight dialects of Quechua in Ecuador, which it illustrates with "The men will come in two days." (''Ethnologue'' 16 (2009) lists nine, distinguishing Cañar from Loja Highland Quechua.) Below are the comparisons, along with Standard (Ecuadorian) Kichwa and [[Southern Quechua|Standard (Southern) Quechua]]:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1744">'''Koalang''' is a term coined by [[Janusz A. Zajdel]], a Polish [[science fiction]] writer. It is a language used by people in a totalitarian world called ''[[Paradyzja]]'' in his 1984 novel of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,2459055.html "Sztuczne języki przeżywają renesans"], ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The "''ko-al''" in "''koalang''" derives from the Polish words ''''kojarzeniowo-aluzyjny'''' ("associative-allusive").&lt;ref name=nk&gt;[http://www.mbp.lublin.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1138&amp;Itemid=1&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=9 "Noc Kultury 2009"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Paradyzja is a [[space station]], and activity is tracked by automatic cameras and analysed, mostly, by computers, its people created an [[Aesopian language]], which is full of [[metaphor]]s that are impossible for computers to grasp. The meaning of every sentence depended on the context. For example, "I dreamt about blue angels last night" means "I was visited by the police last night."

The software that analyzes sentences is [[machine learning|self-learning]]. Thus, a phrase that is used to describe something metaphorically should not be used again in the same context.

Zajdel paid a tribute to [[George Orwell]]'s [[newspeak]] and to [[Aldous Huxley]], by naming one of the main characters ''Nikor Orley Huxwell''.

In the 1980s, the youth magazine ''[[Na Przełaj]]'' (Short Cut) printed [[rock music|rock]] lyrics in a column titled ''KOALANG'', hinting that the songs' texts contained content camouflaged from [[censorship]].&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3623">{{nihongo|'''''Kotobagari'''''|言葉狩り||"word hunting"}} refers to the reluctance to use words that are considered [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] in the [[Japanese language]]. For instance words such as {{nihongo|''rai''|癩||"[[leper]]"}}, {{nihongo|''mekura''|盲||"blind"}}, ''tsunbo'' (聾 "deaf"), ''oshi'' (唖 "deaf-mute"), ''kichigai'' (気違い or 気狂い "crazy"), ''tosatsujō'' (屠殺場 "slaughter house"), and ''hakuchi'' (白痴 "moron/retard") are currently not used by the majority of Japanese publishing houses; the publishers often refuse to publish writing which includes these words.

Another example is a school janitor in [[Japan]] used to be called a ''kozukai-san'' (小使いさん "chore person"). Some felt that the word had a derogatory meaning, so it was changed to ''yōmuin'' (用務員 "task person"). Now ''yōmuin'' is considered demeaning, so [[euphemism treadmill|there is shift]] to use ''kōmuin'' (校務員 "school task member") or ''kanrisagyōin'' (管理作業員 "maintenance member") instead.

Other examples of words which have become unacceptable include the replacement of the word ''hyakushō'' (百姓) for farmer with ''nōka'' (農家). Since World War II, the word ''[[Shina (word)|shina]]'' (支那) for [[China]] written in [[kanji]] has been recognized as derogatory, and has been largely superseded by the Japanese pronunciation of the endonym, ''Chūgoku'' (中国) or with "Shina" written in [[katakana]] (シナ). In the 1960s, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] word {{nihongo||蒙古|Mōko}} meaning "[[Mongols|Mongol]]" was recognized for its connotation of a "stupid, ignorant, or immature" person (c.f. [[Mongoloid]]), and the ethnic group is now called by the katakana {{nihongo||モンゴル|Mongoru}}.&lt;ref&gt;Bulag, Uradyn E. "Contesting the Words that Wound: Ethnicity and the Politics of Sentiment in China." ''Inner Asia'' 10.1 (2008): 87-111.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95}}

==Kotobagari and ideology==
Kotobagari has led to some confusing terminology.

[[NHK]], the Japanese Broadcasting Company, runs a [[Korean language]] study program, but the language is called "[[Hangul]]" to avoid being politically incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.nhk.or.jp/gogaku/hangeul/|title=ハングルのテレビ番組・ラジオ番組 {{!}} NHKゴガク |author=NHK |website=www2.nhk.or.jp |language=ja |access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a result of both the North and South Korean governments demanding that the program be called by the [[names of Korea|name of one country]]. [[North Korea]] wanted the show to be called "Chōsen language" (朝鮮語) taken from its full name, 朝鮮民主主義人民共和国 or Democratic People's Republic of Korea. [[South Korea]] wanted "Kankoku language" (韓国語) from 大韓民国 or Republic of Korea. As a compromise, "Hangul" was selected and Korean is referred to as "the language on this program" or "this language", but this has led to the use of the neologism "Hangul language" (ハングル語) to refer to the Korean language; which is technically incorrect since [[hangul]] itself is a writing system, not a language, and the writing system has also been used for other languages.

'''''Lal Salam''''' ({{lang-ml|ലാൽസലാം}}, {{lang-hi|लाल सलाम}}, {{lang-bn|লাল সেলাম}}, {{lang-ur|لال سلام}}, {{lang-kn|ಕೆಂಪು ವಂದನೆ}}; translation: "[[red salute (disambiguation)|Red Salute]]") is a salute, greeting, or code word used by [[communist|communists]] in [[South Asia]]. The word ''lal'' means "red"; ''[[S-L-M|salam]]'' is an Arabic loanword for a greeting.

In some cases the equivalent phrase ''Surkh Salam'' ({{lang-ur|سرخ سلام}}) is used interchangeably.{{Citation needed|reason=a reference / citation is needed for this statement|date=May 2018}} 

The tribute arranged by comrades after the death of a [[Naxalite]] is also called a ''Lal Salam''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/11/22/stories/2004112211990300.htm Anti-naxal operations streamlined], ''The Hindu'' (newspaper), Published 22 Nov 2004, Retrieved 13 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

A 1990 [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam]] feature film called ''[[Lal Salam (1990 film)|Lal Salam]]'' deals with the growth and deterioration of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|Communist]] government of the state of [[Kerala]], India.

[[File:Maria Petronella Woesthoven2.jpg|thumb|Maria Woesthoven, by [[Leonardus Temminck]]]]

'''Maria Petronella Woesthoven''' (25 October 1760 – 26 January 1830) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[poet]].

==Life==
Woesthoven was born in [[Dantumawoude]], the daughter of military Johannes Woesthoven. 

She was a member of the academy ''[[Amsteldamse Dicht- en Letteroefenend Genootschap]]'' (1786), and the ''[[Kunst Wordt door Arbeid Verkregen]]''. She participated in the board meetings in 1790–94 and was a member of the [[executive committee]] in 1793–94 and as such she received the highest position in the hierarchy awarded to any non-royal Dutch woman at the time. 

She was awarded a gold [[medal]] for her poem ''Amsteldamse'' (1787), and [[silver]] medals for ''Kunstliefde Spaart Geen Vlijt'' (1788), and ''De invloed van een vast geloof aan de voorzienigheid'' (1789).

She was married in 1785 to the [[clerk]] Samuel Elter; at the [[divorce]] in 1803 she was judged as the guilty party after her husband claimed she had intercourse with other men, but was awarded custody of their son, which was unusual for similar cases. She died, aged 69, in [[Amsterdam]].

{{refimprove|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Marquee Sign.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Marquee sign in [[Chapel Hill, NC|Chapel Hill, N.C.]]]]
A '''marquee''' is most commonly a structure placed over the entrance to a [[hotel]] or [[theatre]]. It has signage stating either the name of the establishment or, in the case of theatres, the [[play (theatre)|play]] or [[film|movie]] and the artist(s) appearing at that venue. The marquee is often identifiable by a surrounding cache of light bulbs, usually yellow or white, that flash intermittently or as [[Chase (lighting)|chasing lights]].

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|marquee}}
The current usage of the modern English word ''marquee,'' that in US English refers specifically to a canopy projecting over the main entrance of a theater, which displays details of the entertainment or performers, was documented in the academic journal ''[[American Speech]]'' in 1926: "''Marquee'', the front door or main entrance of the big top."  In British English "marquee" refers more generally to a large tent, usually for social uses. The English word ''marquee'' is derived from the Middle French word ''[[marquise]]'' (the final /z/ probably being mistaken as -s plural), the feminine form corresponding to ''marquis'' ('nobleman').  The word ''marquise'' was also used to refer to various objects and fashions regarded as elegant or pleasing, hence: a kind of pear (1690), a canopy placed over a tent (1718), a type of [[settee]] (1770), a canopy in front of a building (1835), a ring with an elongated stone or setting, a diamond cut as a [[navette]] (late 19th century), and a style of woman's hat (1889).  The oldest form of the word's root ''*merg-'' meant "boundary, border." Other words that descended from this [[Proto-Indo-European root]] include ''margin'', ''margrave'', and ''mark''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00302386?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=marquee&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |title="marquee" |website=dictionary.oed.com |dead-url=yes}} {{dead url|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early examples of the modern use of ''marquee'' include
*'''1931''', ''[[The American Mercury]]'': "''Marquee'', the canopy at the main entrance [of a circus]."
*'''1933''', ''Billboard'', The marquee of the Rivoli, where ''Samarang'' is playing, reads: 'One of the most exciting films ever shown.'
*'''1967''', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'': "British actors mean little on an American movie marquee and Sherlock Holmes always seems old-fashioned."

==History==
[[File:Exterior_of_Earl's_Court_Station,_London,_1973.jpg|thumb|upright|Marquee outside [[Earl's Court tube station]], London, 1973.]]
Movie marquee designs in the United States are closely related to the social, political, and economic forces of the 20th century. The invention of the [[automobile]] influenced many elements of theater architecture.  The marquee in particular became larger, and stood out from the street to serve as a physical and aesthetic landmark from other businesses along the sidewalk. The shape also evolved from a small rectangle to a trapezoid, making it more readable to automobile traffic. The text also became less detailed but larger.  The larger size of the sign and text, combined with the flashing lights and color, made the façade easily visible to fast-passing cars. Movie marquee designs in the 1930s prompted theater historian [[Ben M. Hall]] to call them "electric tiaras."

During [[World War II]], aesthetic considerations of the marquee were dictated by the availability of labor and materials. Building materials such as steel, copper, bronze, and aluminum were limited.  Even in the postwar years, these building materials were mostly dedicated to building civilian housing for returning soldiers and their families. Concrete and glass, two building materials that were not restricted, became essential to movie theater architects. Light was also an unrestricted resource for architects, and combined with glass it produced striking visual effects.  The mild climate of certain locations, such as the American West Coast, also permitted the use of lightweight materials such as porcelain and plastics in marquees. Another benefit of using light and glass together (besides the dramatic appearance it created) was the economic bonus of it being cheap.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, Maggie. ''The Show Starts on the Sidewalk: An Architectural History of the Movie Theatre, Starring S. Charles Lee''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marquees are also used to illuminate the name of an [[arcade game]] at the top of its cabinet.

'''Old Korean''' is the historical variety of the [[Korean language]] or [[Koreanic languages]] dating from the beginning of [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to the latter part of [[Later Silla]],&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|ko|최기호, 국어사 서설}} "The History of the Korean Language", {{lang|ko|제8회 국외 한국어교사 연수회}} "8th Research Conference of Korean Language Teachers Abroad", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; roughly from the fourth to tenth centuries CE.

Old Korean is distinct from [[history of Korean|proto-Korean]] ({{lang|ko|원시 한국어}}), the ancestral language reconstructed from comparison of [[Korean dialects]].

Some linguists had proposed that Old Korean may have been one of the now discredited [[Altaic languages]], although this claim has been controversial and is not accepted by modern linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Kim (2004), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory says that Old Korean is related to the [[Japonic languages]] and to the [[Dravidian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chin-Wu (1974). ''The Making of the Korean Language''. Center of Korean Studies, University of Hawai'i.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources and dating ==
The extent of Old Korean is unclear. It is generally accepted as including [[Sillan language|Sillan]], which is thought to be the direct ancestor of [[Middle Korean|Middle]] and Modern Korean, and may also have included the languages of [[Buyeo language|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo language|Goguryeo]], and [[Baekje language|Baekje]]. If so, Old Korean was a language family, not a single language. (See [[Buyeo languages]], [[Koreanic languages]].)&lt;ref&gt;It has not been proven that during the age of Three Kingdoms of Korea that all three kingdoms used the same language, but it is accepted by many scholars that the Three Kingdoms utilized similar languages, and that these may have been dialects of a single language. {{lang|ko|김수경(1989), 세나라 시기 언어 력사에 관한 남조선 학계의 견해에 대한 비판적 고찰}} ("Criticism about the language opinion during three kingdoms of Korea)&lt;/ref&gt;

Only some literary records of Unified Silla, changed into Goryeo text, are extant and some texts (written in their native Writing system) of the Three Kingdoms period are mostly available in form of inscriptions at present.

Thus, the languages of the Three Kingdoms period are generally examined through official government names and local district names. The point at which Old Korean became Middle Korean is assessed variously by different scholars. The line is sometimes drawn in the late [[Goryeo]] dynasty and sometimes around the 15th century in the early [[Joseon]]. It is usually thought that Middle Korean started with the establishment of a new capital at the foundation of the state of Goryeo.
 
== Writing system ==
The first texts in Old Korean date from the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period.  They are written using Chinese characters ([[hanja]]) to represent the sound and grammar of the native language.  Various systems were used, beginning with ''ad hoc'' approaches and gradually becoming codified in the [[Idu script]] and the [[hyangchal]] system used for poetry, and in a later phase, [[gugyeol]].

Additional information about the language is drawn from various proper nouns recorded in Korean and Chinese records, and from etymological studies of the Korean pronunciations of Chinese characters, which are believed to have been first adapted into Korean in the late Three Kingdoms period.

{{Place of articulation}}
In [[phonetics]], '''palatalization''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|l|ə|t|ə|l|aɪ|ˈ|z|eɪ|ʃ|ən}}, also {{IPAc-en|US|-|l|ᵻ|ˈ|z|eɪ|ʃ|-}}) or '''palatization''' refers to a way of pronouncing a consonant in which part of the tongue is moved close to the [[hard palate]]. A consonant pronounced this way is called a '''palatalized consonant'''. Palatalized consonants have [[secondary articulation]] in the hard palate, or two [[place of articulation|places of articulation]], one of which is palatal. They contrast with [[palatal consonant]]s, which have palatal primary articulation.

Palatalized consonants are pronounced as if followed very closely by the [[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j]}}, the sound of ''y'' in ''yellow''. For example, in the [[Polish language|Polish]] word {{lang|pl|kiedy}} "when", the letters ''ki'' represent a palatalized {{IPA|[k]}}, transcribed as {{IPA|[kʲ]}}. This is a very similar sound to the {{angbr|c}} in the English ''cube''.

==Types==
In technical terms, palatalization refers to the [[secondary articulation]] of [[consonant]]s by which the body of the [[tongue]] is raised toward the [[hard palate]] and the [[alveolar ridge]] during the articulation of the consonant. Such consonants are phonetically palatalized.

"Pure" palatalization is a modification to the articulation of a consonant, where the middle of the tongue is raised, and nothing else. It may produce a [[laminal consonant|laminal]] articulation of otherwise [[apical consonant|apical]] consonants such as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/s/}}.

Phonetically palatalized consonants may vary in their exact realization. Some languages add [[semivowel]]s before or after the palatalized consonant (onglides or offglides). In [[Russian language|Russian]], both plain and palatalized consonant phonemes are found in words like {{lang|ru|большой}} {{IPA-ru|bɐlʲˈʂoj||Ru-большой.ogg}}, {{lang|ru|царь}} {{IPA-ru|tsarʲ||Ru-царь.ogg}} and {{lang|ru|Катя}} {{IPA-ru|ˈkatʲə||Ru-Катя.ogg}}.  Typically, the vowel (especially a non-front vowel) following a palatalized consonant has a palatal onglide. In [[Hupa language|Hupa]], on the other hand, the palatalization is heard as both an onglide and an offglide.  In some cases, the realization of palatalization may change without any corresponding phonemic change.  For example, according to Thurneysen,{{Full|date=February 2011}} palatalized consonants at the end of a syllable in [[Old Irish]] had a corresponding onglide (reflected as {{angbr|i}} in the spelling), which was no longer present in [[Middle Irish]] (based on explicit testimony of grammarians of the time).

In a few languages, including [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]] and many of the [[Central Chadic languages]], palatalization is a [[suprasegmental feature]] that affects the pronunciation of an entire syllable, and it may cause certain vowels to be pronounced [[front vowel|more front]] and consonants to be slightly palatalized. In Skolt Sami and its relatives ([[Kildin Sami language|Kildin Sami]] and [[Ter Sami language|Ter Sami]]), suprasegmental palatalization contrasts with segmental palatal articulation (palatal consonants).

==Transcription==
In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), palatalized consonants are marked by the [[Phonetic symbols in Unicode#Spacing Modifier Letters (U+02B0–02FF)|modifier letter]] {{angbr|ʲ}}, a [[subscript and superscript|superscript version]] of the symbol for the [[palatal approximant]] {{angbr|{{IPA|j}}}}. For instance, {{angbr|{{IPA|tʲ}}}} represents the palatalized form of the [[voiceless alveolar stop]] {{IPA|[t]}}.

[[Obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet|Prior to 1989]], several palatalized consonants were represented by curly-tailed variants in the IPA, e.g., {{angbr|{{IPA|ʆ}}}} for {{IPA|[ʃʲ]}} and {{angbr|{{IPA|ʓ}}}} for {{IPA|[ʒʲ]}}: see [[palatal hook]].

The [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]] marks palatalized consonants by an [[acute accent]], as do some Finnic languages using the Latin alphabet, as in [[Võro language|Võro]] {{angbr|[[ś]]}}. Others use an apostrophe, as in [[Karelian language|Karelian]] {{angbr|s’}}; or digraphs in ''j'', as in the [[Savonian dialects]] of [[Finnish language|Finnish]], {{angbr|sj}}.

==Phonology==
Palatalization has varying [[phonological]] significance in different languages. It is [[allophonic]] in English, but [[phonemic]] in others. In English, consonants are palatalized when they occur before front vowels or the palatal approximant, and no words are distinguished by palatalization ([[complementary distribution]]), but in other languages palatalized consonants appear in the same environments ([[contrastive distribution]]) as plain consonants and [[distinctive feature|distinguish]] words.

===Allophonic===
{{listen

| description4 = phonemically {{IPA|/tiː/}},&lt;br&gt;phonetically {{IPA|[tʲʰi]}}
}}
In some languages, palatalization is [[allophonic]]. Some [[phoneme]]s have palatalized allophones in certain contexts, typically before [[front vowel]]s, and unpalatalized allophones elsewhere. Because it is allophonic, palatalization of this type does not [[distinctive feature|distinguish]] words and often goes unnoticed by native speakers.

Phonetic palatalization occurs in American English. Stops are palatalized before the front vowel {{IPA|/i/}} and not palatalized in other cases.&lt;!-- Palatalization might occur after /eɪ/ as well. --&gt;

===Phonemic===
In some languages, palatalization is a [[distinctive feature]] that distinguishes two consonant [[phoneme]]s. This feature occurs in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Irish language|Irish]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]].

Phonemic palatalization may be contrasted with either plain or [[velarization|velarized]] articulation. In many of the [[Slavic languages]], and some of the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Finnic languages]], palatalized consonants contrast with plain consonants, but in [[Irish language|Irish]] they contrast with velarized consonants.
* Russian {{wikt-lang|ru|нос}} {{audio-IPA|Ru-нос.ogg|/nos/|help=no}} "nose" (unpalatalized {{IPA|/n/}})
: {{wikt-lang|ru|нести|нёс}} {{audio-IPA|Ru-нёс.ogg|/nʲos/|help=no}} "(he) carried" (palatalized {{IPA|/nʲ/}})
* Irish {{wikt-lang|ga|bó}} {{audio-IPA|ga-bó.ogg|/bˠoː/|help=no}} "cow" (velarized ''b'')
: {{wikt-lang|ga|beo}} {{audio-IPA|ga-beo.ogg|/bʲoː/|help=no}} "alive" (palatalized ''b'')

Some palatalized phonemes undergo change beyond phonetic palatalization. For instance, the unpalatalized sibilant (Irish {{IPA|/sˠ/}}, Scottish {{IPA|/s̪/}}) has a palatalized counterpart that is actually [[postalveolar]] {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, not phonetically palatalized {{IPA|[sʲ]}}, and the velar fricative {{IPA|/x/}} in both languages has a palatalized counterpart that is actually palatal {{IPA|/ç/}} rather than palatalized velar {{IPA|[xʲ]}}. These shifts in primary [[place of articulation]] are examples of the sound change of [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].

===Morphophonemic===
{{listen |type=speech
|filename=Ro-ban-bani.ogg |title=Romanian {{lang|ro|ban}}, {{lang|ro|bani}} "coin, coins"|description={{IPA|[ban banʲ]}}}}
In some languages, palatalization is used as a [[morpheme]] or part of a morpheme.

In some cases, a vowel caused a consonant to become palatalized, and then this vowel was lost by [[elision]]. Here there appears to be a [[phonemic contrast]] when analysis of the [[deep structure]] shows it to be allophonic.

In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], consonants are palatalized before {{IPA|/i/}}.  Palatalized consonants appear at the end of the word, and mark the plural in nouns and adjectives, and the second person singular in verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Chițoran|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the surface, it would appear then that {{lang|ro|ban}} {{IPA|[ban]}} "coin" forms a [[minimal pair]] with {{lang|ro|bani}} {{IPA|[banʲ]}} The interpretation commonly taken, however, is that an underlying morpheme {{IPA|{{!}}-i{{!}}}} palatalizes the consonant and is subsequently deleted.

Palatalization may also occur as a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] feature.  For example, although Russian makes phonemic contrasts between palatalized and unpalatalized consonants, alternations across morpheme boundaries are normal:&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvcoltxt|Lightner|1972|pp=9–11, 12–13}} for a fuller list of examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound changes==
{{main|Palatalization (sound change)}}
In some languages, allophonic palatalization developed into phonemic palatalization by [[phonemic split]]. In other languages, phonemes that were originally phonetically palatalized changed further: palatal secondary place of articulation developed into changes in manner of articulation or primary place of articulation.

Phonetic palatalization of a consonant sometimes causes surrounding vowels to change by [[coarticulation]] or [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]. In Russian, "soft" (palatalized) consonants are usually followed by vowels that are relatively more [[front vowel|front]] (that is, closer to {{IPA|[i]}} or {{IPA|[y]}}), and vowels following "hard" (unpalatalized) consonants are further [[back vowel|back]]. See {{section link|Russian phonology|Allophony}} for more information.

==Examples==

===Slavic languages===
In the [[Slavic languages]], palatal or palatalized consonants are called '''soft''' and others are called '''hard'''.

Russian has pairs of palatalized and unpalatalized consonant phonemes. The vowel letters {{angbr|{{lang|ru|[[е]]}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|ru|[[ё]]}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|ru|[[ю]]}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|ru|[[я]]}}}}, and {{angbr|{{lang|ru|[[и]]}}}} indicate that the consonant preceding them is soft. The [[soft sign]] {{angbr|{{lang|ru|ь}}}} also indicates that the previous consonant is soft.

===Goidelic languages===
{{main|Irish phonology#Consonants|Scottish Gaelic phonology#Consonants}}
[[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] have pairs of palatalized (''slender''), and unpalatalized (''broad'') consonant phonemes. In Irish, most broad consonants are [[velarized]]. In Scottish Gaelic, the only velarized consonants are {{IPA|[n̪ˠ]}} and {{IPA|[l̪ˠ]}}; {{IPA|[r]}} is sometimes described as velarized as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Michael. ''Blas na Gàidhlig: The Practical Guide to Gaelic Pronunciation.'' Glasgow: Akerbeltz, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nance, C., McLeod, W., O'Rourke, B. and Dunmore, S. (2016), Identity, accent aim, and motivation in second language users: New Scottish Gaelic speakers’ use of phonetic variation. J Sociolinguistics, 20: 164–191. doi:10.1111/josl.12173&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mandarin Chinese===

Palatalized consonants occur in standard [[Mandarin Chinese]] in the form of the alveolo-palatal consonants, which are written in [[pinyin]] as {{transl|zh|ISO|j}}, {{transl|zh|ISO|q}}, and {{transl|zh|ISO|x}}.

==Other uses==
There are local or historical uses of the term ''palatalization''.

In Slavic linguistics, the "palatal" fricatives marked by a [[háček]] are really [[postalveolar consonant]]s, which historically arose from palatalization. There are also phonetically palatalized consonants, marked with an [[acute accent]], which contrast with that. Thus, a distinction is made between "palatal" (postalveolar) and "palatalized". Such "palatalized" consonants are not always phonetically palatalized. For example, when Russian "soft" consonants appear before front vowels (particularly {{IPA|[i]}}), they are not palatalized and contrast with "hard" consonants (which are typically not palatalized) that are velarized in the same context.

In [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] linguistics, "palatalization" has the standard phonetic meaning: {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/sʲ/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} are distinct phonemes, as they are in Slavic languages, but {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} are not considered either palatal or palatalized sounds. Also, the Uralic palatalized {{IPA|/tʲ/}}, unlike in Russian, is a stop with no frication.

'''''Personal Shorthand''''', originally known as '''''Briefhand''''' in the 1950s, is a completely [[alphabetic]] [[shorthand]].

There are three basic categories of written shorthand.  Best known are pure ''symbol'' (stenographic) shorthand systems (e.g., [[Gregg Shorthand|Gregg]], [[Pitman Shorthand|Pitman]]).  Because the complexity of symbol shorthands made them time-consuming to learn, a variety of newer, ''alphabetic'' shorthands were created, with the goal of being easier to learn– e.g., [[Speedwriting]], [[Stenoscript]], [[Stenospeed]], and [[Forkner shorthand]].  These systems used normally written letters of the alphabet, but also some number of symbols, alphabetic characters changed in shape or position, or special marks for punctuation; and so they are more accurately described as ''hybrid'' shorthand systems. In contrast, Personal Shorthand uses only the 26 letters of the alphabet, without any special symbols, positioning, or punctuation, and it can therefore be written cursively, printed, typed, or even entered in a computer without special typefaces or graphics.

Given years of practice, symbol shorthand writers could sometimes acquire skills of 150 or even 200 words per minute, which might have qualified them for demanding positions such as court reporting, typically dominated today by machine shorthands.  Due to the extensive time necessary, few achieved such a level.  Most symbol shorthand writers in secretarial positions wrote between 80 and 140 words per minute.  Hybrid shorthand systems with higher symbol content generally could be written faster than those with fewer symbols.  In common with most hybrid shorthands, Personal Shorthand cannot be written as fast as symbol shorthands.  However, like some hybrids, learning time is drastically reduced.  Students of Personal Shorthand can acquire a useful shorthand skill (50 to 60 wpm) in a single school term, compared to the year or more for symbol system students to reach that same level.

Without the complexity of symbols to memorize and practice writing, Personal Shorthand theory is relatively simple.  There are six '''Theory Rules'''.  Slightly more than a hundred high-frequency business vocabulary words are represented by a single written letter known as a '''Brief Form''' ("a" for "about", "t" for "time", "v" for "very", etc.).  High-frequency letter groupings within words ("g" for "-ing", "s" for "-tion", etc.), known as '''Phonetic Abbreviations''', are also written with a single letter.  In most Personal Shorthand textbooks, the entire Theory is presented in just ten lessons, after which review and practice can lead to writing speeds of 60 to 100 words per minute.

Authors of the contemporary version of Personal Shorthand are [[Carl W. Salser]], [[C. Theo Yerian]], and [[Mark R. Salser]].

Some play parties have open invitations, others are restricted to members of a BDSM club or people known to the organizers. There may also be a dress code (such as no street clothes), or restrictions on admission such as couples only or no unattached males. Some charge an admission fee, while laws in some areas may not allow a fee, but may take donations, or payment in advance (by some prior date.){{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The amount and kind of sexual contact allowed varies from party to party and city to city, depending on local laws regarding sexual contact, "bawdy houses" and [[public nudity]]. At some parties, penetrative sex may be allowed, while at others full nudity may be banned.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} In 2000, A party in [[Attleboro, Massachusetts]] was invaded by police for alleged violations of [[assault]] and [[Public morality|morality laws]].&lt;ref name=Paddleboro&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171111130315/http://www.nerve.com/Dispatches/Chihara/paddleboro/ Paddleboro by Michelle Chihara - Nerve.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title | This link went dead some time around 2017; It's been replaced with a link to the article in internet archive's Wayback Machine --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10720">In the [[North American Numbering Plan]], a '''rate center''' ('''rate centre''' in [[Canada]]) is a geographically-specified area used for determining mileage and/or usage dependent rates in the [[public switched telephone network]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northern911.com/pdf/NENA-Acronyms.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a [[wire center]] (which is the actual physical [[telephone exchange]] building), a rate center is a regulatory construct created primarily for billing purposes.

Each rate center is associated with:
* a geographical place name (city, province/state)
* a nominal physical location (V and H co-ordinates) for distance calculations for billing purposes
* one or more prefixes, in the form +1-NPA-NXX, which each identify a block of ten thousand [[telephone number|directory numbers]]
* a specified local calling area, identified as a list of other individual rate centers to which local or flat-rate landline calling is provided

A rate center may contain one or multiple physical wire centers; conversely, it may merely be a [[legal fiction]] retained for billing purposes with its actual subscribers served from the same physical switch as an adjacent community.

A telephone number prefix (1+6 digits) normally suffices to uniquely identify a rate center; if [[number pooling]] and [[local number portability]] were not in use, it would also uniquely identify a wire center.

For instance, [[BUtterfield 8]] (+1-212-288-xxxx) identifies a specific office ([[CLLI code]] NYCMNY79DS1, [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]]'s building at 208 E 79th St, New York NY) as its default wire center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telcodata.us/view-switch-detail-by-clli?clli=NYCMNY79DS1|title=TelcoData.US: View switch detail by CLLI|author=|date=|work=TelcoData.us|access-date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but identifies "New York City, Zone 1" as a rate center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localcallingguide.com/lca_prefix.php?npa=212&amp;nxx=288|title=Local calling guide: NPA-NXX search for (212) BUtterfield-8|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "New York City, Zone 1" includes multiple competing telephone companies operating various wire centers (for land line, [[voice over IP]] and [[mobile phone]] service) at multiple central offices across all of Manhattan's [[area codes 212 and 646|212]]. These facilities are in multiple locations throughout the borough.

== Implications ==
[[Local number portability]] allows a number to be moved to a different carrier or a different wire center within the same rate center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npac.com/number-portability/how-lnp-works|title=How LNP Works|work=NPAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landline provider typically will not allow a cross-town move to a different rate center under the same number at standard rates; possible alternatives include expensive [[foreign exchange service (telecommunications)|foreign exchange service]] or a nomadic class of service such as [[voice over IP]] or a [[mobile phone]].

The choice of rate center determines the inbound local calling area for a number, an important consideration in markets where local calls are flat-rated but toll calls are expensive. A number in [[Area codes 416, 647, and 437|area code 416]] is in the [[Toronto]] rate center, so local to everything between [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] and [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]]; the suburban rate centers are less valuable as one suburb to another on the other side of the same city ([[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] to [[Malton, Ontario|Malton]], for example) is often a toll call.

Mobile phones are usually assigned to a downtown rate center in order to obtain a better inbound local calling area. This will cause attempts to port from wireless to wireline service to fail if the wireline is outside the city center and therefore in a different rate center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pipelinepub.com/pdfs/ads/evolving/WNP_Overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of large numbers of relatively geographically-small rate centers allows relatively short haul connections to be long distance, with the local calling area varying arbitrarily from one portion of the same town to another. ([[Mississauga]] has five rate centers, left over from individual villages pre-dating its 1974 incorporation, with a different local calling area for each. Some are local to [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]], some are not.) Occasionally, an adjacent pair of locations will be a toll call just by being located on opposite sides of an arbitrary rate center boundary. In some cases, multiple rate centers within the same newly amalgamated municipality are long distance to each other, as was the case when [[Hull, Quebec]] and its suburbs [[Aylmer, Quebec|Aylmer]] and [[Gatineau]] were amalgamated in 2002. The suburb of Gatineau remained long distance to Aylmer until August 16, 2007, five years post-annexation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/communities-abandoned-by-crtc-says-commissioner/41294|title=Communities abandoned by CRTC, says commissioner|work=IT World Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rate center boundaries do not necessarily align with county or municipal boundaries; this is an issue for some [[9-1-1]] deployments which assume the correct [[public-safety answering point]] (PSAP) can be chosen merely by inspecting the first few digits of the calling number.&lt;ref&gt;http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.nena.org/resource/collection/1F053CE7-3DCD-4DD4-9939-58F86BA03EF7/NENA_03-505-v1_Rate_Center_Consolidation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They also occasionally cross geographic area code boundaries, such as [[Ottawa]]-[[Hull, Quebec|Hull]]&lt;!-- do *not* change this to Gatineau, the rate center is still named Ottawa-Hull. Gatineau is a suburb. --&gt; in [[area code 613|613]]/[[area code 819|819]]; carriers often maintain numbers in inventory in each area code in these rate centers, tying up more prefixes.

Often, the rationale for a separate rate center is arbitrary or based on historical factors which no longer apply. Some tiny place used to be a separate village or used to have a small manual switchboard, but was swallowed by urban or suburban sprawl years ago — yet the rate center (and a restrictive local calling area) still exists.

[[Incumbent local exchange carrier]]s, such as the regional Bell operating companies, have typically resisted rate center consolidation because "[[local access and transport area|intraLATA]] toll calls", relatively short-haul US domestic long distance calls handled by the local carrier instead of an interexchange carrier, represent $2.7 billion per year for which they can bill subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/ptech/03/09/rate.center.consolidation.idg/index.html|title=Complex calling plans jeopardize phone numbers|date=March 9, 2001|author=David Rhode|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, incumbent carriers will threaten small communities with substantial increases in the monthly cost of an individual line if rate center consolidation expands local calling areas. The rare exceptions have been small groups of suburbs which each already have the same local calling area; one unified rate center would allow wire-line subscribers to keep existing numbers if they move from one of the communities to another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhpioneerdaily.com/archive/2010/may/05_03_10.pdf Qwest files a request with PUC for Northern Hills consolidation], Bob Mercer, Black Hills Pioneer (South Dakota) May 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, a proliferation of multiple small rate centers increases the quantity of wasted numbers as multiple [[competitive local exchange carrier]]s each obtain blocks of 10,000 numbers (1000 numbers if [[number pooling]] is in effect) in each area code in each of the multiple rate centers in which they plan to offer new service. A new entrant with just a handful of initial subscribers in each rate center will be left with many vacant numbers. This inefficient use of numbering resources leads to shortages of available prefixes, which then prematurely require introduction of [[split plan]] or [[overlay plan]] area codes.

A few rate center consolidations have been made in the interest of number conservation. Scarce 1-212 numbers are more efficiently allocated now that [[Manhattan]], New York, is entirely "NYC Zone 1" instead of being split into Zones 1, 2, and 3; various [[area code 612]] rate centers have been amalgamated into "[[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]], [[Minnesota]]". These rare efforts normally operate in parallel with other conservation measures, such as [[number pooling]] and aggressive reclamation of unused central office codes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">{{Canadian Charter}}
'''Section 14''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is the last section under the "Legal rights" heading in the ''Charter''.  It provides anyone in a court the right to an [[Interpreter (communication)|interpreter]] if the person does not speak the [[language]] being used or is [[Deafness|deaf]].

==Text==
The section states:

{{cquote|14. A party or witness in any proceedings who does not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted or who is deaf has the right to the assistance of an interpreter.}}


Before the ''Charter'' was enacted in 1982, the right to an interpreter in a trial existed under the [[common law]], because it was believed to be necessary for [[natural justice]].  The right was incorporated into the ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'' in 1960.  Section 2(g) of this Act read that a person has a right to "the assistance of an interpreter in any proceedings in which he is involved or in which he is a party or a witness, before a court, commission, board or other tribunal, if he does not understand or speak the language in which such proceedings are conducted."

Unlike the ''Charter'', the ''Bill of Rights'' was a [[statute]] and not part of the [[Constitution of Canada]].  The ''Bill of Rights'' also did not guarantee this right to the deaf community.  The language right was included in an early draft of the ''Charter'', and the rights belonging to the deaf later appeared in April 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 1149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has said the right also has a basis in Canada's [[multiculturalism]].  Canadians' "multicultural heritage" is recognized in [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 27]] of the ''Charter''.&lt;ref name="Tran"&gt;''R. v. Tran'', 1994 CanLII 56 (S.C.C.), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The rights implied by section 14 were defined by the Supreme Court in the case ''[[R. v. Tran]]'' (1994), which involved an interpreter for a defendant who spoke [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] in an [[English language]] trial.  The Supreme Court found that section 14 requires the translation to be of consistent quality ("continuity") and unbiased accuracy.  However, not everything in the trial must be translated if it is not truly important to the defendant's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, page 1150.&lt;/ref&gt;  The finding on the required quality came from the purpose of the right, which, based in natural justice and multiculturalism, emphasized that a defendant must fully understand the trial.  Natural justice means a defendant can respond to accusations.  The Court also stated that the quality of the translation must not be so high that the defendant is actually more informed than those who speak the court's language.&lt;ref name="Tran"/&gt;

Usually a person who wishes to have an interpreter must ask for his or her section 14 rights to be fulfilled and carries the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that he or she actually does not understand the court's language.  The court itself is also responsible for satisfying the right, and sometimes a section 14 request does not have to be made by a defendant in order for an interpreter to be provided under section 14.&lt;ref name="Tran"/&gt;

'''Selma Ottilia Lovisa Lagerlöf''' ({{IPA-sv|²sɛlːma ²lɑːɡɛrˌløːv|lang|sv-Selma Lagerlöf.ogg}}; 20 November 1858 – 16 March 1940) was a Swedish author and teacher. She published her first novel, ''[[Gösta Berling's Saga]]'', at the age of 33. She was the first female writer to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], which she was awarded in 1909. Additionally, she was the first female to be granted a membership in The [[Swedish Academy]] in 1914.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Swedish Women's Writing 1850-1995|last=Forsas-Scott|first=Helena|publisher=The Athlone Press|year=1997|isbn=0485910039|location=London|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Selma Lagerlöf in 1881.jpg|thumb|left|Anna Ollson, Karlstad: Photograph of future writer Selma Lagerlof, taken in 1881]]

Born  at [[Mårbacka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=36 |title=The American-Scandinavian review |volume=4 |editor=Henry Goddard Leach |publisher=American-Scandinavian Foundation |year=1916 |chapter=Miss Lagerlöf at Marbacka |author=H. G. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now in [[Sunne Municipality]]) an [[Estate (house)|estate]] in [[Värmland]] in western Sweden, Lagerlöf was the daughter of Erik Gustaf Lagerlöf, a lieutenant in the Royal Värmland Regiment, and Louise Lagerlöf ''née'' Wallroth, whose father was a well-to-do merchant and a [[foundry]] owner (''brukspatron'').&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Saga of Gosta Berling|last=Lagerlof|first=Selma|last2=Schoolfield|first2=George|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2009|isbn=9781101140482|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagerlöf was the couple's fifth child out of six. She was born with a [[Hip dysplasia (human)|hip injury]], which was caused by detachment in the hip joint. At the age of three and a half, a sickness left her lame in both legs, although she later recovered.  

She was a quiet child, more serious than others her age, with a deep love for [[Reading (process)|reading]]. She was constantly writing poetry as a child, but did not publish anything officially until later in life. Her grandmother helped raise her, often telling stories of fairytales and fantasy. Growing up, she was plain and slightly lame, and an account stated that the cross-country wanderings of the majoress and Elisabet in ''The Saga of Gosta Berling'' could be the author's compensatory fantasies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As many other children of the upper class, the children of the family received their education at home, since the [[Volksschule]] system, compulsory education system, was not [[Education in Sweden#History of education in Sweden|fully developed yet]]. Their teacher thus came to Mårbacka and the children received education in [[English language|English]], as well as [[French language|French]]. Selma finished reading her first novel at the age of seven. The novel was ''Osceola'' by [[Thomas Mayne Reid]]. After completing the novel, Selma is said to have decided on becoming an author when she grew up.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marbacka.com/selma_lagerlof.php&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 10, 1868, Selma completed reading the [[Bible]]. At this time her father was very ill, and she hoped that God would heal her father if she read the Bible from cover to cover. Her father lived for another 17 years. In this manner, Selma Lagerlöf became accustomed to the language of Scripture from an early age. 

The sale of Mårbacka following her father's illness in 1884 had a serious impact on her development. Selma's father is said to have been an alcoholic, something she rarely discussed.&lt;ref name="Selma Lagerlöf: Surface and Depth"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/01/11/selma-lagerlof-surface-and-depth/|title=Selma Lagerlöf: Surface and Depth|website=The Public Domain Review|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father did not want Selma to continue an education, or remain involved with the women's movement.{{Clarify|reason=How did this involvement start?|date=September 2018}} Later in life, she would buy back her father's estate with the money she received for her Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Selma-Lagerlof|title=Selma Lagerlof {{!}} Swedish author|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagerlöf lived there for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1909/lagerlof/facts/|title=Selma Lagerlöf - Facts - NobelPrize.org|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also completed her studies  at the [[Royal Seminary]] to become a teacher the same year as her father passed away.

== Career ==
Lagerlöf was educated at the [[Högre lärarinneseminariet]] in Stockholm from 1882 to 1885. She worked as a country schoolteacher at a high school for girls in [[Landskrona]] from 1885 to 1895,&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Lagerlof, Ottilia Lovisa Selma}}&lt;/ref&gt; while honing her story-telling skills, with particular focus on the legends she had learned as a child. She liked the teaching profession and appreciated her students. She had a talent for capturing the children's attention through telling them stories about the different countries about which they were studying or stories about [[Jesus]] and his disciples. During this period of her life, Selma lived with her aunt Lovisa Lagerlöf.

Through her studies at the Royal Women's Superior Training Academy in [[Stockholm]], Lagerlöf reacted against the realism of contemporary Swedish-language writers such as [[August Strindberg]]. She began her first novel, ''[[Gösta Berling's Saga]],'' while working as a teacher in Landskrona. Her first break as a writer came when she submitted the first chapters to a literary contest in the magazine'' [[Idun (magazine)|Idun]]'', and won a publishing contract for the whole book. At first, her writing only received mild reviews from critics.  Once a popular male critic, George Brandes, gave her positive reviews of the Danish translation, her popularity soared.&lt;ref name="Selma Lagerlof"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://authorscalendar.info/lagerlof.htm|title=Selma Ottiliana Lovisa Lagerlöf (1858–1940)|website=authorscalendar.info|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received financial support of [[Fredrika Limnell]], who wished to enable her to concentrate on her writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Selma Lagerlof Megapack: 31 Classic Novels and Stories|last=Lagerlof|first=Selma|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|year=2013|isbn=9781434443441|location=Rockville|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sophie Elkan &amp; Selma Lagerlöf.jpg|thumb|Sophie Elkan (right) and Selma Lagerlöf (left)]]

In 1894, she met the Swedish writer [[Sophie Elkan]], who became her friend and companion; their letters suggest Lagerlöf fell deeply in love with her.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;{{citation |last=Munck |first=Kerstin |title=Lagerlöf, Selma |periodical=[[glbtq.com]] |year=2002 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/lagerlof_s.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116195125/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/lagerlof_s.html |archivedate=16 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over many years, Elkan and Lagerlöf critiqued each other's work. Lagerlöf wrote that Elkan strongly influenced her work and that she often disagreed sharply with the direction Lagerlöf wanted to take in her books.  Selma's letters to Sophie were published in 1993, titled ''Du lär mig att bli fri'' (''You Teach me to be Free'').&lt;ref name="Selma Lagerlof" /&gt; 

[[File:Selma Lagerlof nobel prize illustration.png|thumb|left|Selma Lagerlöf receives the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], illustration from [[Svenska Dagbladet]], 11 December 1909.]]

A visit in 1900 to the [[American Colony (Jerusalem)|American Colony]] in [[Jerusalem]] became the inspiration for Lagerlöf's book by that name.&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{citation |url=http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/TimesOfChange/book_ch1_3.html |title=Times of Change |first=Heike |last=Zaun-Goshen |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617050146/http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/TimesOfChange/book_ch1_3.html |archivedate=17 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The royal family and the Swedish Academy gave her substantial financial support to continue her passion&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1909/lagerlof-bio.html|title=Selma Lagerlöf – Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jerusalem'' was also acclaimed by critics, who began comparing her to Homer and Shakespeare, so that she became a popular figure both in Sweden and abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1895, she gave up her teaching to devote herself to her writing. With the help of proceeds from ''Gösta Berlings Saga'' and a scholarship and grant, she made two journals, which were largely instrumental in providing material for her next novel. With Elkan, she traveled to Italy, and she also traveled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and other parts of the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Lagerlöf, Selma}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, a legend of a Christ Child figure that had been replaced with a false version inspired Lagerlöf's novel ''Antikrists mirakler'' (''The Miracles of the Antichrist''). Set in [[Sicily]], the novel explores the interplay between Christian and socialist moral systems.  However, most of Lagerlöf's stories were set in Värmland.

In 1902, Lagerlöf was asked by the National Teacher's Association to write a geography book for children. She wrote ''Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige'' (''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''), a novel about a boy from the southernmost part of Sweden, who had been shrunk to the size of a thumb and who travelled on the back of a goose across the country. Lagerlöf mixed historical and geographical facts about the provinces of Sweden with the tale of the boy's adventures until he managed to return home and was restored to his normal size.&lt;ref name="Selma Lagerlöf: Surface and Depth" /&gt; The novel is one of Lagerlöf's most well-known books, and it has been translated into more than 30 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.lu.se/en/sites/ub.lu.se.en/files/2006_nils_holgersson_100_ar.pdf |title=100 år med Nils Holgersson |publisher=Lund University Library |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She moved in 1897 to [[Falun]], and met [[Valborg Olander]], who became her literary assistant and friend, but Elkan's jealousy of Olander was a complication in the relationship. Olander, a teacher, was also active in the growing [[women's suffrage movement]] in Sweden. Selma Lagerlöf herself was active as a speaker for the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]], which was beneficial for the organisation because of the great respect which surrounded Lagerlöf, and she spoke at the International Suffrage Congress in Stockholm in June 1911, where she gave the opening address, as well as at the victory party of the Swedish suffrage movement after women suffrage had been granted in May 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Hedwall, Barbro (2011).

About women's struggle for suffrage) Förlag Bonnier. {{ISBN|978-91-7424-119-8}} (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Selma Lagerlöf was a friend of the German-Jewish writer [[Nelly Sachs]]. Shortly before her death in 1940, Lagerlöf intervened with the Swedish royal family to secure the release of Sachs and Sachs' aged mother from Nazi Germany, on the last flight from Germany to Sweden, and their lifelong asylum in Stockholm.

== Literary adaptations ==
[[File:Selma Lagerlof.jpg|thumb|A street in [[Jerusalem]], named for Lagerlöf]]
In 1919, Lagerlöf sold all the movie rights to all of her as-yet unpublished works to Swedish Cinema Theatre ({{lang-sv|Svenska Biografteatern}}), so over the years, many movie versions of her works were made. During the era of Swedish silent cinema, her works were used in film by [[Victor Sjöström]], [[Mauritz Stiller]], and other Swedish film makers.&lt;ref&gt;Furhammar, Leif (2010), "Selma Lagerlöf and Literary Adaptations", Mariah Larsson and Anders Marklund (eds), "Swedish Film: An Introduction and Reader", Lund: Nordic Academic Press, pp. 86–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Sjöström's retelling of Lagerlöf's tales about rural Swedish life, in which his camera recorded the detail of traditional village life and the Swedish landscape, provided the basis of some of the most poetic and memorable products of silent cinema. [[Jerusalem (novel)|''Jerusalem'']] was adapted in 1996 into an internationally acclaimed film ''Jerusalem''.

In the story, she asks her father for help with the debt she owes and her father explains the debt is from all the people who supported her throughout her career.&lt;ref name="Selma Lagerlöf: Surface and Depth" /&gt; In 1904, the Academy had awarded her its great gold medal, and in 1914, she also became a member of the academy. For both the academy membership and her Nobel literature prize, she was the first woman to be so honored.&lt;ref name=ea /&gt;
In 1991, she became the first woman to be depicted on a Swedish banknote, when the first 20-kronor note was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbanknotescoins.com/2015/04/20-swedish-krona-banknote-2008-selma-lagerlof.html 20 Swedish Krona banknote 2008 Selma Lagerlöf]. worldbanknotescoins.com (20 April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, she received the degree of [[LL.D.|doctor of letters]] from Uppsala University.&lt;ref name=ea /&gt; In 1928, she received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Greifswald]]'s [[University of Greifswald Faculty of Arts|Faculty of Arts]]. At the start of [[World War II]], she sent her Nobel Prize medal and gold medal from the Swedish Academy to the government of Finland to help raise money to fight the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="magiczone"&gt;{{citation |page=36 |title=The magic zone: sketches of the Nobel Laureates |first=Ralph |last=Gunther |periodical=Scripta Humanistica |year=2003 |volume=150 |isbn=1-882528-40-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish government was so touched that it raised the necessary money by other means and returned her medal to her.

Two hotels are named after her in Östra Ämtervik in Sunne, and her home, Mårbacka, is preserved as a museum.

'''Sharad Gogate''' (Sharadchandra Prabhakar Gogate {{lang-mr|शरद्चन्द्र प्रभाकर गोगटे}}) (born 27 June 1936) is a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] publisher and writer from [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

==Biography==
'''Sharad Prabhakar Gogate''' is the youngest son of Mr. Prabhakar Gopal Gogate and Mrs. Sumati Prabhakar  Gogate of Bhusawal. He comes from a family of lawyers; his father as well as both his grandfathers were practicing lawyers.

He went to Pune for education in 1953. He received his college education at [[Fergusson College]] and ILS Law College at [[Pune]].
After L.L.B., though he had thought of practicing in the [[Mumbai]] High court, he discovered his love for books and got into the book selling business instead.

In 1966, Gogate married [[Shubhada gogate|Pushpa Ranade]] of Nasik, who herself went on to become a well-known writer in Marathi.

Gogate has been associated with Book selling and publishing since 1963. He worked in a big book shop on Deccan Gymkhana called “Deccan Book Stall” in Pune, before starting his own book shop – '''Saraswat''' ({{lang-mr|सारस्वत}}), in 1968. He started a publishing company in 1975 called '''Shubhada – Saraswat''' ({{lang-mr|शुभदा – सारस्वत}}).

==Notable works published by Shubhada Saraswat==

===Important reference works===

* Marathi – English Dictionary by Moleswarth
* English-Marathi Dictionary by N. B. Ranade
* Vyutpatti Kosh (व्युत्पत्तिकोश) by K.P. Kulkarni
* Gomantak: Prakruti Ani Sanskruti (3 Volumes) by B. D. Satoskar
* Bharatiya Tatwadnyanacha Bruhad Itihaas (12 Volumes) by G. N. Joshi

===Other award-winning publications===

* Khandalyachya Ghatasaathi  By Shubhada Gogate
* Aaranyak by Milind Vatwe
* Sanskrit Va Prakrit Bhasha by Madhav Deshpande

=== Other notable publication===
And a very notable publication of Shubhada – Saraswat which created quite a storm when it was first published in 1983, is '''Yes, I am Guilty!''' by [[Munawwar Shah]].

==Beyond publishing==

Sharad Gogate retired from active book publishing in 2001 and turned to writing. All his writing has been about his passion – book publishing.
His most notable writing is '''Marathi GranthPrakashanachi 200 Varshe''' ({{lang-mr|मराठी ग्रन्थप्रकाशनाची 200 वर्षे}}), which is a comprehensive study of first 200 years of Marathi Publishing from 1805 to 2005. This has been a very difficult work to complete and needed a lot of research. Not a whole lot of material was easily available and not many publishers of present day were able to help to put together the journey of Marathi publishing over the 200 years. He explains this in detail in the preface of the book.

He has been a guest lecturer at various courses and workshops on publishing conducted by University of Pune as well as other well-known educational institutes.

{{redirect|Slanguage}}

'''Slang''' is language (words, [[Phrase|phrases]], and usages) of an [[Register (sociolinguistics)|informal register]] that members of special groups like teenagers, musicians, or criminals favor (over a [[standard language]]) in order to establish group identity, exclude outsiders, or both. 

Slang is used in a way that sometimes people of higher social status will criticize people who use it.

==Etymology of the word ''slang''==
In its earliest attested use (1756), the word ''slang'' referred to the vocabulary of "low or disreputable" people. By the early nineteenth century, it was no longer exclusively associated with disreputable people, but continued to be applied to usages below the level of standard educated speech.&lt;ref name ="oed"&gt;{{cite web | title = Slang | work = Oxford English Dictionary | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50226993?query_type=word&amp;queryword=slang | accessdate = 4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the word is uncertain, although it appears to be connected with [[thieves' cant]]. A Scandinavian origin has been proposed (compare, for example, Norwegian ''slengenavn'', which means "nickname"), but based on "date and early associations" is discounted by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. Jonathan Green, however, agrees with the possibility of a Scandinavian origin, suggesting the same root as that of ''sling'', which means "to throw", and noting that slang is thrown language - a quick, honest way to make your point.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of slang|url=http://digital.films.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?aid=19267&amp;xtid=6547|website=Films on Demand|publisher=Films Media Group|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web | title = Slang| work = Online Etymological Dictionary
 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slang
 | accessdate = 4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining slang ==
[[Linguist]]s have no simple and clear definition of slang, but agree that it is a constantly changing linguistic phenomenon present in every subculture worldwide. Some argue that slang exists because we must come up with ways to define new experiences that have surfaced with time and modernity.&lt;ref name="Dumas&amp;Lighter"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dumas | first1 = Bethany K. | last2 = Lighter | first2 = Jonathan | year = 1978 | title = Is Slang a Word for Linguists? | url = | journal = American Speech | volume = 53 | issue = 5| pages = 14–15 | doi = 10.2307/455336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempting to remedy the lack of a clear definition, however, Bethany K. Dumas and Jonathan Lighter argue that an expression should be considered "true slang" if it meets at least two of the following criteria:&lt;ref name="Dumas&amp;Lighter"/&gt;

:* It lowers, if temporarily, "the dignity of formal or serious speech or writing"; in other words, it is likely to be considered in those contexts a "glaring misuse of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]".
:* Its use implies that the user is familiar with whatever is referred to, or with a group of people who ''are'' familiar with it and use the term.
:* "It's a taboo term in ordinary discourse with people of a higher social status or greater responsibility."
:* It replaces "a well-known conventional synonym." This is done primarily to avoid discomfort caused by the conventional synonym or discomfort or annoyance caused by having to elaborate further.

Michael Adams remarks that, "[Slang] is liminal language... it is often impossible to tell, even in context, which interests and motives it serves... slang is on the edge."&lt;ref name="People's Poetry"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Adams | first1 = Michael | year = 2009 | title = Slang: The People's Poetry | url = http://site.ebrary.com/lib/berkeley/docDetail.action?docID=10597107 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slang dictionaries, collecting thousands of slang entries, offer a broad, empirical window into the motivating forces behind slang".&lt;ref name="new partridge dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|title=A dictionary of slang and unconventional English (Slang itself being slang for Short Language) : colloquialisms and catch phrases, fossilized jokes and puns, general nicknames, vulgarisms and such Americanisms as have been naturalized|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-29189-7|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many forms of language may be considered "sub-standard", slang remains distinct from [[colloquial]] and [[jargon]] terms because of its specific social contexts. While considered inappropriate in formal writing, [[Colloquialism|colloquial terms]] are typically considered acceptable in speech across a wide range of contexts, while slang tends to be considered unacceptable in many contexts. [[Jargon]] refers to language used by personnel in a particular field, or language used to represent specific terms within a field to those with a particular interest.  Although jargon and slang can both be used to exclude non–group members from the conversation, the intention of jargon is to optimize conversation using terms that imply technical understanding. On the other hand, slang tends to emphasize social and contextual understanding.

While colloquialisms and jargon may seem like slang because they reference a particular group, they do not fit the same definition, because they do not represent a particular effort to replace standard language. Colloquialisms are considered more standard than slang, and jargon is often created to talk about aspects of a particular field that are not accounted for in the standard lexicon.&lt;ref name="topical dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=Slang: The Topical Dictionary of Americanisms|year=2010|isbn=0802718493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often difficult to differentiate slang from colloquialisms and even more standard language, because slang generally becomes accepted into the standard lexicon over time. Words such as "spurious" and "strenuous" were once slang, though they are now accepted as standard, even high register words. The literature on slang even discusses mainstream acknowledgment of a slang term as changing its status as true slang, because it has been accepted by the media and is thus no longer the special insider speech of a particular group. Nevertheless, a general test for whether a word is a slang word or not is whether it would be acceptable in an academic or legal setting, as both are arenas in which standard language is considered necessary and/or whether the term has been entered in the Oxford English Dictionary, which some scholars claim changes its status as slang.&lt;ref name="topical dictionary" /&gt;

== Formation of slang ==
It is often difficult to collect etymologies for slang terms, largely because slang is a phenomenon of speech, rather than written language and etymologies which are typically traced via [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]].

[[Eric Partridge]], cited as the first to report on the phenomenon of slang in a systematic and linguistic way, postulated that a term would likely be in circulation for a decade before it would be written down.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt;  Nevertheless, it seems that slang generally forms via deviation from a standard form. This "spawning" of slang occurs in much the same way that any general [[semantic change]] might occur. The difference here is that the slang term's new meaning takes on a specific social significance having to do with the group the term indexes.

Coleman also suggests that slang is differentiated within more general semantic change in that it typically has to do with a certain degree of “playfulness". The development of slang is considered to be a largely “spontaneous, lively, and creative” speech process.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Julie|title=Life of slang|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199571996|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, while a great deal of slang takes off, even becoming accepted into the standard lexicon, much slang dies out, sometimes only referencing a group. An example of this is the term "groovy" which is a relic of 1960's and 70's American "hippy" slang. Nevertheless, for a slang term to become a slang term, people must use it, at some point in time, as a way to flout standard language.&lt;ref name="topical dictionary" /&gt;  Additionally, slang terms may be borrowed between groups, such as the term "gig" which was originally coined by jazz musicians in the 1930s and then borrowed into the same hippy slang of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="topical dictionary" /&gt; 'The word "groovy" has remained a part of subculture lexicon since its popularization. It is still in common use today by a significant population. The word "gig" to refer to a performance very likely originated well before the 1930s, and remained a common term throughout the 1940s and 1950s before becoming a vaguely associated with the "hippy slang of the 1960s". The word "gig" is now a widely accepted synonym for a concert, recital, or performance of any type. "Hippy" is more commonly spelled "hippie".

Generally, slang terms undergo the same processes of [[semantic change]] that words in the regular lexicon do.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt;

Slang often will form from words with previously differing meanings, one example is the often used and popular slang word "lit", which was created by a generation labeled "Generation Z". The word itself used to be associated with something being on fire or being "lit" up until 1988 when it was first used in writing to indicate a person who was drunk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Warbirds: Diary of an Unknown Aviator|last=Girder|first=John|publisher=Texas A &amp; M University Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the book "Warbirds: Diary of an Unknown Aviator". Since this time "lit" has gained popularity through Rap songs such as ASAP Rocky's "Get Lit" in 2011. As the popularity of the word has increased so too has the number of different meanings associated with the word. Now "lit" describes a person who is drunk and/or high, as well as an event that is especially awesome and "hype".

Words and phrases from popular [[Hollywood films]] and [[television series]] frequently become slang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merry|first1=Stephanie|title=‘As if’: 40 comedies from the past 40 years that changed the way we talk|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/classic-apps/as-if-40-comedies-from-the-past-40-years-that-changed-the-way-we-talk/2018/03/28/affa2e04-2889-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?wpisrc=nl_rainbow&amp;wpmm=1|website=Washington Post|accessdate=9 April 2018|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social implications ==

=== Indexicality ===
Slang is usually associated with a particular group and plays a role in constructing our identities. While slang outlines social space, attitudes about slang partly construct group identity and identify individuals as members of groups. Therefore, using the slang of a particular group will associate an individual with that group. Using [[Michael Silverstein|Silverstein's]] notion of different orders of [[indexicality]], it can be said that a slang term can be a second-order index to this particular group. Employing a slang term, however, can also give an individual the qualities associated with the term's group of origin, whether or not the individual is actually trying to identify as a member of the group. This allocation of qualities based on abstract group association is known as third-order indexicality.

As outlined by Elisa Mattiello in her book,&lt;ref name="Mattiello"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattiello|first=Elisa|title=An introduction to English slang: a description of its morphology, semantics and sociology|year=2008|publisher=Polimetrica|location=Milano|isbn=8876991131}}&lt;/ref&gt; a slang term can take on various levels of identification. Giving the examples of the terms "foxy" and "shagadelic", Mattiello explains that neither term makes sense given a standard interpretation of English:
* "foxy", although clearly a "denominal adjective" from its -y suffix, does not make sense semantically, as it is a synonym with sexy and has nothing to do with foxes;&lt;ref&gt;It should, perhaps, be pointed out that the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''foxy'' as 'foxlike; of the nature or appearance of a fox; esp. crafty, cunning' and cites an example from [[Tennyson]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* "shagadelic" is a combination of a slang term with a slang [[suffix]] and therefore is considered an "extra-grammatical" creation.

Nevertheless, Matiello concludes that those [[Agency (sociology)|agents]] who identify themselves as "young men" have "genuinely coined" these terms and choose to use them over "canonical" terms —like beautiful or sexy—because of the indexicalized social identifications the former convey.

==== First and second order indexicality ====
In terms of first and second order indexicality, the usage of speaker-oriented terms  by male adolescents indicated their membership to their age group, to reinforce connection to their peer group, and to exclude outsiders.&lt;ref name=Mattiello /&gt;

==== Higher-order indexicality ====
In terms of higher order indexicality, anyone using these terms may desire to appear fresher, undoubtedly more playful, faddish, and colourful than someone who employs the standard English term "beautiful". This appearance relies heavily on the hearer's third-order understanding of the term's associated social nuances and presupposed use-cases.&lt;ref name=Mattiello /&gt;

=== Subculture associations ===
Often, distinct subcultures will create slang that members will use in order to associate themselves with the group, or to delineate outsiders.

Slang terms are often known only within a [[clique]] or [[ingroup]]. For example, [[Leet]] ("Leetspeak" or "1337") was originally popular only among certain Internet subcultures, such as [[Software cracking|software crackers]] and online video gamers. During the 1990s, and into the early 21st century, however, Leet became increasingly more commonplace on the Internet, and it has spread outside Internet-based communication and into spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Anthony|title=A Leet Primer|date=December 6, 2005|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/47607.html#|accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of slang include [[SMS language]] used on mobile phones, and "chatspeak", (e.g., "[[LOL]]", an acronym meaning "laughing out loud" or "laugh out loud" or [[ROFL]], "rolling on the floor laughing"), which are widely used in instant messaging on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slang Dictionary|url=http://slang-dictionary.weebly.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As subcultures are also often forms of counterculture and counterculture itself can be defined as going against a standard, it follows that slang has come to be associated with counterculture.

=== Social media and Internet slang ===
Slang is often taken from social media as a sign of social awareness and shared knowledge of [[popular culture]]. This particular branch of slang has become more prevalent since the early 2000s as a result of the rise in popularity of social networking services, including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Instagram]]. This has created new vocabularies associated with each new social media venue, such as the use of the term “friending” on Facebook, which is a [[verbification]] of “friend” used to describe the process of adding a new person to one's list of friends on the website, despite the existence of an analogous term “befriend“. This term is much older than Facebook, but has only recently entered the popular lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=Megan|title='Friend,' as a Verb, Is 800 Years Old|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/friend-as-a-verb-is-800-years-old/278109/|website=https://www.theatlantic.com/|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the slang found in social media include a general trend toward shortened words or acronyms. These are especially associated with services such as Twitter, which now has a 280 character limit for each message and therefore requires a briefer, more condensed manner of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Caroline|title=Our Updated Guide To Twitter Slang, Lingo, Abbreviations And Acronyms|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-guide-to-twitter-slang-lingo-abbreviations-and-acronyms-2013-9|website=http://www.businessinsider.com/|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the use of [[hashtags]] which explicitly state the main content of a message or image, such as #food or #photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fortunato|first1=Joe|title=The Hashtag: A History Deeper than Twitter|url=http://www.copypress.com/blog/the-hashtag-a-history-deeper-than-twitter/|website=www.copypress.com|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debates about slang ===

Some critics believe that when slang language becomes more commonplace it effectively eradicates the proper use of a certain language. However, other linguists believe that language is not static but ever-changing and that slang terms are valid words within a language's lexicon. While prescriptive linguists study and analyze the so-called "correct" ways to speak, according to a language's grammar and syntactical words, descriptive linguists tend to study language to further understand the subconscious rules of how individuals speak, which makes slang important in understanding such rules. Noam Chomsky, a founder of anthropological linguistic thought, challenged structural and prescriptive linguistics and began to study sounds and morphemes functionally, as well as their changes within a language over time.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Bruce M., and Diane P. Levine. 2012. A Concise Introduction to Linguistics 3rd edition. Boston: Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|978-0205051816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surtitles''', also known as '''supertitles''', are translated or transcribed [[lyrics]]/[[dialogue]] projected above a stage or displayed on a screen, commonly used in [[opera]] or other musical performances. The word "surtitle" comes from the [[French language]] "sur", meaning "over" or "on", and the [[English language]] word "title", formed in a similar way to the related [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]]. The word ''Surtitle'' is a [[trademark]] of the [[Canadian Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Surtitles™: An Introduction |url=http://www.surtitles.com/intro.html |accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surtitles are used either to translate the meaning of the lyrics into the audience's language, or to transcribe lyrics that may be difficult to understand in the sung form. The two possible types of presentation of surtitles are as projected text, or as the [[electronic libretto]] system. Titles in the theatre have proven a commercial success in areas such as opera, and are finding increased use for allowing [[hearing impaired|hearing-impaired]] patrons to enjoy theatre productions more fully. Surtitles are used in live productions in the same way as subtitles are used in [[movie]] and [[television]] productions.

==Projected titles or translations==
Generally projected above the theatre's [[proscenium arch]] (but, alternately, on either side of the stage), surtitles are usually displayed using a supertitling machine. The text must be prepared beforehand as in [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]]s. These machines can be used for events other than artistic performances, when the text is easier to show to the audience than it is to vocalize.

Surtitles are different from [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]]s, which are more often used in [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]]. Originally, translations would be broken up into small chunks and photographed onto slides that could be projected onto a screen above the stage, but most companies now use a combination of video projectors and computers.

John Leberg developed the Surtitle system for the [[Canadian Opera Company]] when he was the company's director of operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The COC launches surtitles |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-coc-launches-surtitles |website=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) |date=27 March 1983 |access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Lotfi Mansouri]], then general director of the company, first used the system in the January 1983 staging of ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]''.&lt;ref name=WhoWhoMansouri&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New York City Opera]] was the first American opera company to use supertitles, in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/arts/music/22tomm.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5124&amp;en=17bccce51d5712e9&amp;ex=1342756800&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink&lt;/ref&gt;

The surtitle is given an insertion point in the score (piano score) for the surtitle's entry and exit. An operator will push a button at the marked point when following the music.

==Personal titling systems==
Surtitles can be a distraction, focusing attention on the titles instead of the stage.  Therefore, several systems have been developed to provide captions visible only to those individual viewers who wish to see them.

===Electronic libretto system===
The [[electronic libretto]] system uses individual screens placed in front of each seat allowing patrons either to view a translation or to switch them off during the performance.  [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Metropolitan Opera]] installed the [[patent]]ed ''Met Titles'', becoming the first house in the [[United States]] to use this system.

The [[Vienna State Opera]] and [[Santa Fe Opera]] use such a system.  It allows the patron to choose among several different languages.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
&lt;!-- 
Many people believe that surtitles can interfere with the enjoyment of a show, because they tend to find themselves following the titles and not giving their full attention to the stage. 
This problem was solved by the development of an [[electronic libretto]] system, which uses individual screens placed in front of each seat allowing patrons either to view a translation or to switch them off during the performance.  New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]] installed the [[patent]]ed ''Met Titles'', was the first house in the [[United States]] to use this system.

 --&gt;

===Rear Window Captioning System===
The [[Rear Window Captioning System]] is a method for presenting, through captions, a transcript of the audio portion of a film in theatres. The system was co-developed by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] and Rufus Butler Seder and initially targeted at people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

On the way into the theatre, viewers pick up a reflective plastic panel mounted on a flexible stalk. The panel sits in a seat cupholder or on the floor adjacent to the seat. A large LED display is mounted on a rear wall that displays caption characters in mirror image. Viewers move the panels into position (usually below the movie screen or stage) so they can read the reflected captions and watch the presentation. Others seated alongside do not watch, or usually even see, the captions.

'''Syndeton''' (from the Greek συνδετόν "bound together with") or '''syndetic coordination''' in [[grammar]] is a form of [[syntax|syntactic]] [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] of the elements of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (conjuncts) with the help of a [[coordinating conjunction]].

In a simple syndeton, two conjuncts are joined by a conjunction: "I will have eggs '''and''' ham".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/rs/g/Syndeton.htm |title=syndeton - definition and examples of syndeton and syndetic |publisher=Grammar.about.com |date=2013-11-13 |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In syndetic coordination with more than two conjuncts, the conjunction is placed between the two last conjuncts: "I will need bread, cheese and ham". The [[serial comma]] is not usually used in front of the conjunction between the last two items in [[British English]], while [[American English]] generally suggests a comma: "I will need bread, cheese, and ham".

The '''Tatar language''' ({{lang-tt|татар теле}}, {{lang|tt-Latn|tatar tele}}; {{lang|tt-Cyrl|татарча}}, {{lang|tt-Latn|tatarça}}) is a [[Turkic language]] spoken by [[Tatars]] mainly located in modern [[Tatarstan]], [[Bashkortostan]] ([[European Russia]]), as well as [[Siberia]]. It should not be confused with the [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] language which is closely related, but belongs to another, the [[Cuman]] subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages]].

==Geographic distribution==
The Tatar language is spoken in [[Russia]] (about 5.3 million people), [[Ukraine]], [[China]], [[Finland]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]], the [[United States|United States of America]], [[Romania]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Israel]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], and other countries. There are more than 7 million speakers of Tatar in the world.

Tatar is also native for several thousand [[Mari people|Maris]]. [[Mordva]]'s [[Qaratay]] group also speak a variant of Kazan Tatar.

In the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 census]], 69% of Russian Tatars who responded to the question about language ability claimed a knowledge of the Tatar language.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Census 2010. [http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol4/pub-04-06.pdf Владение языками населением] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tatarstan, 93% of Tatars and 3.6% of [[Russians]] did so. In neighbouring Bashkortostan, 67% of Tatars, 27% of Bashkirs, and 1.3% of Russians did.&lt;ref&gt;Russian Census 2010.

===Official status===

Tatar, along with Russian, is the official language of the [[Republic of Tatarstan]]. The [[official script]] of Tatar language is based on the [[Cyrillic script]] with some additional letters. The Republic of Tatarstan passed a law in 1999, which came into force in 2001, establishing an official Tatar Latin alphabet. A Russian federal law overrode it in 2002, making Cyrillic the sole official script in Tatarstan since. Unofficially, other scripts are used as well, mostly Latin and Arabic. All official sources in Tatarstan must use Cyrillic on their websites and in publishing. In other cases, where Tatar has no official status, the use of a specific alphabet depends on the preference of the author.

The Tatar language was made a ''de facto'' official language in Russia in 1917, but only within the [[Tatar ASSR|Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Tatar is also considered to have been the official language in the short-lived [[Idel-Ural State]], briefly formed during the [[Russian Civil War]].

The usage of Tatar declined from during the 20th century. By the 1980s, the study and teaching of Tatar in the public education system was limited to rural schools. However, Tatar-speaking pupils had little chance of entering university because higher education was available in Russian almost exclusively.

As of 2001 Tatar was considered a potentially endangered language while Siberian Tatar received "endangered" and "seriously endangered" statuses, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education in Tatar can only be found in [[Tatarstan]], and is restricted to the [[humanities]]. In other regions Tatar is primarily a spoken language and the number of speakers as well as their proficiency tends to decrease. Tatar is popular as a written language only in Tatar-speaking areas where schools with Tatar language lessons are situated. On the other hand, Tatar is the only language in use in rural [[administrative divisions of the Republic of Tatarstan|districts of Tatarstan]].

Since 2017 Tatar language classes are no longer mandatory in the schools of Tatarstan.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Russia, [http://www.bbc.com/russian/features-42186885 Без языка: Казань отказалась от обязательных уроков татарского], 01.12.2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to the opponents of this change, it will further endanger the Tatar language and is a violation of the Tatarstan Constitution which stipulates the equality of Russian and Tatar languages in the republic.&lt;ref&gt;БИЗНЕС Online, [https://www.business-gazeta.ru/article/358446 Татарский язык становится «ящиком Пандоры»], 22.09.2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;БИЗНЕС Online, [https://www.business-gazeta.ru/article/363554 Исмагил Хуснутдинов: «Под лозунгом добровольности татарский язык пытаются изгнать из школ»], 12.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects of Tatar===
There are two main dialects of Tatar:
* Central or Middle (Kazan)
* Western (Mişär or Mishar)

All of these dialects also have subdivisions. Significant contribution to the study of the Tatar language and its dialects, were made by a  scientist [[Gabdulkhay Akhatov]], who is considered to be the founder of the modern Tatar dialectological school.

Spoken idioms of Siberian Tatars, which differ significantly from the above two,  are often considered as the third dialect group of Tatar by some, but as an independent language on its own by others.

====Central or Middle====
The Central or Middle dialectal group is spoken in Kazan and most of Tatarstan and is the basis of the standard literary Tatar language.

====Mişär====
{{Main article|Mishar Tatar dialect}}
In the Western (Mişär) dialect ''ç'' is pronounced {{IPAblink|tɕ}} (southern or Lambir Mişärs) and as {{IPAblink|ts}} (northern Mişärs or Nizhgars). ''C'' is pronounced {{IPAblink|dʑ}}. There are no differences between ''v'' and ''w'', ''q'' and ''k'', ''g'' and ''ğ'' in the Mişär dialect. (The Cyrillic alphabet doesn't have special letters for ''q'', ''ğ'' and ''w'', so Mişär speakers have no difficulty reading Tatar written in Cyrillic.)

This is the dialect spoken by the [[Finnish Tatars|Tatar minority of Finland]].

====Siberian Tatar====
{{Main article|Siberian Tatar language}}
Two main isoglosses that characterize Siberian Tatar are ''ç'' as {{IPAblink|ts}} and ''c'' as {{IPAblink|j}}, corresponding to standard {{IPAblink|ɕ}} and {{IPAblink|ʑ}}. There are also grammatical differences within the dialect, scattered across Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/nasia_report.html#SibTatar Information about Siberian Tatar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many linguists claim the origins of Siberian Tatar dialects are actually independent of Volga–Ural Tatar; these dialects are quite remote both from Standard Tatar and from each other, often preventing mutual comprehension. The claim that this language is part of the modern Tatar language is typically supported by linguists in Kazan and denounced by Siberian Tatars.

Over time, some of these dialects were given distinct names and recognized as separate languages (e.g. the [[Chulym language]]) after detailed linguistic study. A brief linguistic analysis shows that many of these dialects exhibit features which are quite different from the Volga–Ural Tatar varieties, and should be classified as Turkic varieties belonging to several sub-groups of the Turkic languages, distinct from [[Kipchak languages]] to which Volga–Ural Tatar belongs.

===Vowels===
[[File:Tatar vowels F1 F2.png|thumb|Tatar vowel formants F1 and F2]]
There exist several interpretations of the Tatar vowel phonemic inventory. In total Tatar has nine or ten native vowels, and three or four loaned vowels (mainly in Russian loanwords).&lt;ref name="Harrison&amp;Kaun"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdI5AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|title=Current Trends in Caucasian, East European and Inner Asian Linguistics|last=Harrison|first=K.

According to [[Nikolai Baskakov (linguist)|Baskakov]] (1988) Tatar has only two vowel heights, [[high vowel|high]] and [[low vowel|low]]. There are two low vowels, [[front vowel|front]] and [[back vowel|back]], while there are eight high vowels: front and back, [[roundedness|round]] (R+) and unround (R-), normal and short (or reduced).&lt;ref name="Harrison&amp;Kaun" /&gt;

According to Makhmutova (1969) Tatar has three vowel heights: [[high vowel|high]], [[Mid-centralized vowel|mid]] and [[low vowel|low]], and four tongue positions: front, front-central, front-back and back.&lt;ref name="Harrison&amp;Kaun" /&gt;

The mid back unrounded vowel ''''ë'' is usually transcribed as ''[[ı]]'', though it differs from the corresponding Turkish vowel.

The tenth vowel ''ï'' is realized as the diphthong ''ëy'' ({{IPA-all|ɯɪ}}), which only occurs word-finally, but it has been argued to be an independent phoneme.&lt;ref name="Harrison&amp;Kaun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt;

Phonetically, the native vowels are approximately thus (with the Cyrillic letters and the usual Latin romanization in angle brackets):

|

In polysyllabic words, the front-back distinction is lost in reduced vowels: all become mid-central.&lt;ref name="Harrison&amp;Kaun" /&gt; The mid reduced vowels in an unstressed position are frequently elided, as in кеше ''keşe'' {{IPA|[kĕˈʃĕ]}} &gt; {{IPA|[kʃĕ]}} 'person', or кышы ''qışı'' {{IPA|[qɤ̆ˈʃɤ̆]}} &gt; {{IPA|[qʃɤ̆]}} '(his) winter'..&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt; Low back {{IPAslink|ɑ}} is rounded {{IPAblink|ɒ}} in the first syllable and after {{IPAblink|ɒ}}, but not in the last, as in бала ''bala'' {{IPA|[bɒˈlɑ]}} 'child', балаларга ''balalarğa'' {{IPA|[bɒlɒlɒrˈʁɑ]}} 'to children'.&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt; In Russian loans there are also {{IPAblink|ɨ}}, {{IPAblink|ɛ}}, {{IPAblink|ɔ}}, and {{IPAblink|ä}}, written the same as the native vowels: '''ы, е/э, о, а''' respectively.&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt;

====Historical shifts====
Historically, the Old Turkic mid vowels have [[Raising (phonetics)|raised]] from mid to high, whereas the Old Turkic high vowels have become the Tatar reduced mid series. (The same shifts have also happened in [[Bashkir language|Baskir]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Turkic languages|last=Johanson|first=Lars|chapter=The History of Turkic|year=1998|editor-last=Johanson|editor-first=Lars |editor-last2=Csató|editor-first2=Éva Á.|publisher=Routledge|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Notes
:{{note|loan|*}} The phonemes {{IPAslink|v}}, {{IPAslink|ts}}, {{IPAslink|tɕ}}, {{IPAslink|ʒ}},  {{IPAslink|h}}, {{IPAslink|ʔ}} are only found in loanwords. {{IPAslink|f}} occurs more commonly in loanwords, but is also found in native words, e.g. ''yafraq'' 'leaf'.&lt;ref name="Berta" /&gt; {{IPAslink|v}}, {{IPAslink|ts}}, {{IPAslink|tɕ}}, {{IPAslink|ʒ}} may be substituted with the corresponding native consonants {{IPAslink|w}}, {{IPAslink|s̪|s}}, {{IPAslink|ɕ}}, {{IPAslink|ʑ}} by some Tatars. 

:{{note|dialect|†}} {{IPAslink|dʑ}} and {{IPAslink|tɕ}} are the dialectal Western (Mişär) pronunciations of '''җ'''{{nbsp}}⟨'''c'''⟩{{nbsp}}{{IPAslink|ʑ}} and '''ч'''{{nbsp}}⟨'''ç'''⟩{{nbsp}}{{IPAslink|ɕ}}, the latter are in the literary standard and in the Central (Kazan) dialect. {{IPAslink|ts}} is the variant of '''ч'''{{nbsp}}⟨'''ç'''⟩{{nbsp}}{{IPAslink|ɕ}} as pronounced in the Eastern (Siberian) dialects and some Western (Mişär) dialects. Both {{IPAslink|tɕ}} and {{IPAslink|ts}} are also used in Russian loanwords (the latter written '''ц''').
:{{note|uvular|‡}} {{IPAslink|q}} and {{IPAslink|ʁ}} are usually considered allophones of {{IPAslink|k}} and {{IPAslink|ɡ}} in the environment of back vowels, so they never written in the Tatar Cyrillic orthography in native words, and only rarely in loanwords with '''къ''' and '''гъ'''. However, {{IPAslink|q}} and {{IPAslink|ʁ}} also appear before front {{IPAslink|æ}} in Perso-Arabic loanwords which may indicate the phonemic status of these uvular consonants.

====Palatalization====
Tatar consonants usually undergo slight [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] before front vowels. However, this [[allophony]] is not significant and does not constitute a phonemic status. This differs from Russian where palatalized consonants are not [[allophone]]s but [[phoneme]]s on their own. There are a number of Russian loanwords which have a palatalized consonants in Russian and thus written the same in Tatar (often with the "soft sign" '''[[ь]]'''). The Tatar standard pronunciation also requires palatalization in such loanwords, however, some Tatar may pronounce them non-palatalized.

===Syllables===
In native words there are six types of syllables ('''C'''onsonant, '''V'''owel, [[sonorant|'''S'''onorant]]):
* V ('''ı'''-lıs, '''u'''-ra, '''ö'''-rä)
* VC ('''at'''-law, '''el'''-geç, '''ir'''-kä)
* CV ('''qa'''-la, '''ki'''-ä, '''su'''-la)
* CVC ('''bar'''-sa, '''sız'''-law, '''köç'''-le, '''qoş'''-çıq)
* VSC ('''ant'''-lar, '''äyt'''-te, '''ilt'''-kän)
* CVSC ('''tört'''-te, '''qart'''-lar, '''qayt'''-qan)

Loanwords allow other types: CSV ('''gra'''-mota), CSVC (käs-'''trül'''), etc.

===Prosody===
Stress is usually on the final syllable.  However, some suffixes cannot be stressed, so the stress shifts to the syllable before that suffix, even if the stressed syllable is the third or fourth from the end. A number of Tatar words and grammatical forms have the natural stress on the first syllable. Loanwords, mainly from Russian, usually preserve their original stress (unless the original stress is on the last syllable, in such a case the stress in Tatar shifts to suffixes as usual, e.g. ''sovét'' &gt; ''sovetlár'' &gt; ''sovetlarğá'').

===Phonetic alterations===
Tatar [[phonotactics]] dictate many pronunciation changes which are not reflected in the orthography.

* Unrounded vowels ''ı'' and ''e'' become rounded after ''o'' or ''ö'':
::коры/''qorı'' &gt; [qoro]
::борын/''borın'' &gt; [boron]
::көзге/''közge'' &gt; [közgö]
::соры/''sorı'' &gt; [soro]

* Nasals are [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]] to the following stops:
::унбер/''unber'' &gt; [umber]
::менгеч/''mengeç'' &gt; [meñgeç]

* Stops are [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]] to the preceding nasals (this is reflected in writing):
::урманнар/''urmannar'' ( &lt; ''urman'' + ''lar'')
::комнар/''komnar'' ( &lt; ''kom'' + ''lar'')

* Voicing may also undergo [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]:
::күзсез/''küzsez'' &gt; [küssez]

* Unstressed vowels may be [[syncope (phonetics)|syncopated]] or [[vowel reduction|reduced]]:
::урыны/''urını''&gt; [urnı]
::килене/''kilene'' &gt; [kilne]

* Vowels may also be [[elision|elided]]:
::кара урман/''qara urman'' &gt; [qarurman]
::килә иде/''kilä ide'' &gt; [kiläyde]
::туры урам/''turı uram'' &gt; [tururam]
::була алмын/''bula almım'' &gt; [bulalmım]

* In [[consonant cluster]]s longer than two [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]], '''ı''' or '''e''' (whichever is dictated by [[vowel harmony]]) is inserted into speech as an [[epenthetic vowel]].
::банк/''bank'' &gt; [bañqı]

* Final [[consonant cluster]]s are simplified:
::артист/''artist'' &gt; [artis]

* [[Final devoicing]] is also frequent:
::табиб/''tabib'' &gt; [tabip]

[[File:Tatar guide in Latin.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|Some guides in [[Kazan]] are in [[Latin]] script, especially in fashion boutiques]]
[[File:Nizhny-Novgorod-Mosque-inscription-C0274.jpg|thumb|Tatar sign on a [[madrasah]] in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], written in both Arabic and Cyrilic Tatar scripts]]

During its history Tatar has been written in [[Arabic script|Arabic]], [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script]]s.

Before 1928, Tatar was mostly written with in Arabic script (Иске имля/[[İske imlâ]], "Old orthography", to 1920; Яңа имла/[[Yaña imlâ]], "New orthography", 1920–1928).

During the 19th century Russian Christian missionary [[Nikolay Ilminsky]] devised the first Cyrillic alphabet for Tatar. This alphabet is still used by Christian Tatars ([[Kryashens]]).

In the [[Soviet Union]] after 1928, Tatar was written with a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] called [[Yañalif|Jaᶇalif]].

In 1939, in [[Tatarstan]] and all other parts of the Soviet Union a [[Cyrillic script]] was adopted and is still used to write Tatar. It is also used in [[Kazakhstan]].

The Republic of Tatarstan passed a law in 1999 that came into force in 2001 establishing an official Tatar Latin alphabet. A Russian federal law overrode it in 2002, making Cyrillic the sole official script in Tatarstan since. In 2004, an attempt to introduce a Latin-based alphabet for Tatar was further abandoned when the [[Constitutional Court of Russia|Constitutional Court]] ruled that the federal law of 15 November 2002 mandating the use of Cyrillic for the state languages of the republics of the Russian Federation&lt;ref name="FederalLaw"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spolsky|first=Bernard|title=Language Policy|ISBN=978-0-521-01175-4|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not contradict the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian constitution]].&lt;ref name="RussianConstitutionalCourt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4016571.stm|title=Russia court sticks to letter law|date=16 November 2004|accessdate=20 February 2012|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with this Constitutional Court ruling, on 28 December 2004, the Tatar Supreme Court overturned the Tatarstani law that made the Latin alphabet official.&lt;ref name="TatarSupremeCourt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usefoundation.org/view/517|title=The Tatar language will continue to be written through the Cyrillic alphabet|date=February 2005|accessdate=20 February 2012|work=U.S. English Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430044601/http://www.usefoundation.org/view/517|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the Tatarstan government adopted a new Latin alphabet but with the limited usage (mostly for Romanization).

==History==
{{Main article|Turkic languages#Vocabulary comparison}}
[[File:Хальфин Азбука татарского языка 1778.pdf|thumb|upright=0.9|right|First printed Tatar [[alphabet book]] (1778)]]

Tatar's ancestors are the extinct [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] and [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] languages.

The literary Tatar language is based on the Middle Tatar dialect and on the [[Old Tatar language]] (''İske Tatar Tele''). Both are members of the Volga-Ural subgroup of the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] group of [[Turkic languages]], although they also partly derive from the ancient Volga [[Bulgar language]]. 

Most of the [[Uralic languages]] in the [[Volga River]] area have strongly influenced the Tatar language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~turkish/aatt/tatar.htm Tatar language – Princeton University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213002624/http://www.princeton.edu/~turkish/aatt/tatar.htm |date=13 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as have the [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;
{{ru icon}} [http://www.languages-study.com/tatar.html Татарский язык в Интернете: информация о методах и средствах обучения]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], although similar by name, belongs to another subgroup of the Kipchak languages, usually called [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Pontic]], [[Cuman]] or [[Polovtsi]]an. Unlike Kazan Tatar, Crimean Tatar is heavily influenced by [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

==Examples==
[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 1:

;Cyrillic
Барлык кешеләр дә азат һәм үз абруйлары һәм хокуклары ягыннан тиң бупып туапар. Аларга акыл һәм вөҗдан бирелгән һәм бер-берсенә карата туганнарча мөнасәбәттә булырга тиешләр.

;Romanization
Barlıq keşelär dä azat häm üz abruyları häm xoquqları yağınnan tiñ bulıp tualar. Alarğa aqıl häm wöcdan birelgän häm ber-bersenä qarata tuğannarça mönasäbättä bulırğa tieşlär

Designed for use in [[telemarketing]] and outbound call centers, TeleBlock is applied to a subscriber's telephone carrier, provided voice lines, or delivered through their predictive dialing and [[Customer relationship management|Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM) software. The system triggers all predetermined outbound calls to query a proprietary customer specific DNC database in real-time.

==History==

On November 9, 1999, Alison (Garfinkel) Andrews, president and inventor of Call Compliance, and Dean Garfinkel, CEO of Call Compliance, Inc., filed a patent&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=UsgIAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent No. 6,330,317]&lt;/ref&gt; for a "call blocking system". The patent describes a call blocking system as:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The integration of various federally required and state mandated do-not-call lists for telemarketers into a system that automatically blocks outgoing calls from a number of companies ("Customer Companies") taking into account factors such as preexisting customers which may legally be contacted is disclosed. The system reviews outgoing calls by a telemarketer, compares it to the general do-not-call lists and the specific customer company do-not-call list and override permitted call list to make a determination if the call should be completed. This integration is due to the incorporation of a general purpose computer in a central location that is connected to all the major telephone carriers switch cluster locations and operated by a service provider. The "do-not-call" database of originating/destination pairs, as well as the logic for blocking or permitting telephone calls, is stored in this computer. This computer makes all blocking decisions in real-time based on the originating and destination number combinations of the call."&lt;ref name="abstract"&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6330317.html Patent Abstract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612192240/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6330317.html |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The patent was issued on December 11, 2001.&lt;ref name="patent" /&gt;

In 2010, Teleblock was acquired by Gryphon Networks.

==Government testimony==

In a statement to the [[United States]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regarding Do Not Call regulations in the US, [[Steve Carter (Indiana politician)|Steve Carter]], Attorney General of [[Indiana]], commented on the effectiveness of TeleBlock. In his comments, Carter stated that TeleBlock has "supplied a cost-effective, straightforward tool for telemarketers to comply with the Commission's Rules, the Federal Trade Commission's Rules, and the various state rules governing telephone solicitations."&lt;ref name="INAG"&gt;[http://www.callcompliance.com/media/2005/11-16-05.htm STATE OF INDIANA'S COMMENTS], Comments from Steve Carter, Attorney General of Indiana&lt;/ref&gt;  Carter went on to say, "TeleBlock has yet to see one of its customers fined."&lt;ref name="INAG" /&gt;

==State DNC rules==

Some companies, such as Call Compliance, Inc., offer a list of all state DNC regulations in one area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.callcompliance.com/regulations/state-regulations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14436">[[Honorifics (linguistics)|Honorifics]] are a class of [[word]]s or grammatical [[morpheme]]s that encode a wide variety of social relationships between interlocutors or between interlocutors and referents.&lt;ref name= "Foley"&gt;Foley, William.  ''Anthropological Linguistics: An Introduction''. Oxford: Blackwell, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Honorific phenomena in [[Thai language|Thai]] include honorific [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], honorific [[pronominal]]s, and honorific [[Grammatical particle|particles]].

==Historical development==
'''Thai honorifics''', although not as extensive as Japanese honorifics, date back to the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], a period which lasted from 1238 to 1420 CE&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;Khanittanan, Wilaiwan. "An aspect of the origins and development of linguistic politeness in Thai". ''Broadening the horizon of linguistic politeness''. Ed. Robin T. Lakoff and Sachiko Ide. Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing, 2005. 315-335.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Sukhothai period, honorifics appeared in the form of [[Kinship terminology|kinship terms]].&lt;ref name="JSS_071_0g"/&gt;  The Sukhothai period also saw the introduction of many [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Pali]] loanwords to Thai.  Later, in the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] (1351 to 1767 CE), a new form of honorific speech evolved.  While kinship terms continued to be used, a royal [[vocabulary]] known as "raja-sap" ({{lang-th|ราชาศัพท์}}; {{RTGS|Rachasap}}) emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url= http://thai-language.com/id/590084/|title= Royal Words ||date= October 9, 2013|website= Internet resource for the Thai language 
|publisher=  thai-language.com|accessdate= 4 October 2013|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Raja-sap, an honorific register, was created as a way for commoners and aristocrats alike to talk to and about the [[Monarchy of Thailand|king of Thailand]].  Soon after its creation, the use of royal vocabulary was extended to address all members of the royal family as well as aristocrats. At the same time, a [[cleric]]al vocabulary used to talk to or about monks arose, very similar to the raja-sap.  With the development of royal and clerical vocabularies, means for honorific speech increased significantly.  The [[Bangkok]] period, from 1782 to the present, saw even greater expansion of the raja-sap as it became the formal, or polite, way to address all peoples or topics.  Specifically, [[lexical item]]s from honorific registers replaced native Thai [[pronoun]]s, resulting in an entirely new set of pronominal forms.  Kinship terms continued to be used as honorifics, and a new type of honorific emerged as well, polite particles.

==Honorific registers==
&lt;!-- "Merit (Buddhism)" links here --&gt;
The roots of Thai honorific registers lie in Khmer and Khmero-Indic (Pali or [[Sanskrit]] words borrowed first into Khmer, then from Khmer into Thai) [[loanword]]s.&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt;  Khmer and Khmero-Indic words were originally borrowed into Thai by an educated, Thai upper class, specifically kings and monks, in order to discuss [[Buddhism]].  When the need for honorific registers arose, the Thai people turned again to Khmer.  Borrowing heavily from Khmer, the Thai constructed a royal vocabulary, a large [[lexicon]] of Khmer and Khmero-Indic words, appropriate for addressing the monarchy.  At the same time, a clerical vocabulary emerged, much smaller but similar in function and origin to the royal vocabulary.  The clerical vocabulary, also composed mainly of borrowings from Khmer, enabled the common people to communicate with and about monks.  Lexical items from standard Thai, royal vocabulary, and clerical vocabulary are shown side by side in the table below:

==Honorific pronominals==
===Personal pronouns===
[[Personal pronoun]]s are the most numerous and complex of pronominal forms in Thai.  Personal pronouns may make the following [[Semantics|semantic]] distinctions:&lt;ref name= "Cooke"&gt;Cooke, Joseph R. "Pronominal Reference in Thai, Burmese, and Vietnamese." ''University of California Publications in Linguistics 52'' (1968): 1-68.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Grammatical number|Number]]: singular, plural, ambiguous
#[[Grammatical person|Person]]: first person, second person, third person, ambivalent
#[[Grammatical gender|Gender]]
##Primary distinctions are distinctions of gender that are inherent to pronouns: male, female
##Secondary distinctions are distinctions of gender that depend on the presence or absence of other semantic features like status, intimacy, or non-restraint: male orientation, female orientation, neutral orientation
#Age: absolute, relative
#Speaker-addressee-referent relationship
##Primary distinctions
###Status-the status of the speaker relative to an addressee or referent. Status may be determined by relative age (elders have higher status), rank (king&gt;royalty&gt;monks&gt;government and military&gt;professionals&gt;white collar&gt;blue collar), or non-intimacy (strangers are treated as at least equals)
###Intimacy - the kind and degree of close, day-by-day association
###Non-restraint
##Secondary distinctions
###Deference
###[[Politeness]]
###Assertiveness

===Kinship terms===
Kinship terms are used pronominally to elevate or demonstrate solidarity with an addressee.&lt;ref name= "Khan"/&gt;  To address a listener as kin is, in effect, to confer the listener with the same status as the aforementioned kin.  Generally, kinship terms contain both literal and displaced meanings.&lt;ref name= "Cooke"/&gt;  Kinship terms are considered literal in cases of blood kin, [[affinal kin]], and [[teknonymy]].  They are considered displaced when used with kinlike individuals: intimate friends of kin or kin of intimate friends.  When using kinship terms, age is critical.&lt;ref name= "Khan"/&gt;  Speakers must estimate the age of an addressee to determine his or her generation and choose an appropriate kinship term.  
Kinship terms commonly used as honorific pronominals are summarized in the table below.&lt;ref name= "Smyth"&gt;Smyth, David. ''Thai: An Essential Grammar''. London: Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}
Speakers may demonstrate additional respect by adding the polite title ''khun'' before any kinship term.  Kinship terms are commonly followed by personal names or nicknames.

===Status terms===
Status terms denote referents in terms of occupation or status.&lt;ref name= "Khan"/&gt;  While some status terms are used as first, second, or third person pronouns, others are restricted to second and third person only.  Many pronominal status terms are preceded by titles, such as [[Thai royal and noble titles#Khun|''khun'' or ''thân'']].  Status terms may also be used as titles before given names.&lt;ref name="JSS_071_0g"&gt;{{cite journal

|}

===Names===
In Thai, a person's full name consists of a [[given name]] followed by a [[surname]] or [[family name]].&lt;ref name= "Cooke"/&gt;  In addition, most individuals have a nickname.  As pronominals, given names are used most frequently in second person form.  Given names are often preceded by the [[Thai royal and noble titles#Khun .28courtesy title.29|courtesy title ''khun'']] when addressing friends or acquaintances.  Given names are sometimes truncated to convey mild informality.  Nicknames, like given names, are used most often in second person.  They generally do not take titles.  Nicknames are a friendly, affectionate way to show intimacy between interlocuters.

==Honorific particles==
Honorific particles are added to the end of an [[utterance]] or [[clause]] to show respect to the addressee.&lt;ref name= "Kummer"&gt;Kummer, Manfred. "Politeness in Thai". ''Politeness in Language: Studies in its History, Theory, and Practice''. Ed. Richard J. Watts, Sachiko Ide, and Konrad Ehlich. Berlin: Moutun de Gruyter, 1992. 325-336.&lt;/ref&gt;  Honorific particles may exhibit the following semantic distinctions:
#Sex: male, female, neutral
#Status: superior, equal, inferior
#Social mood: a continuum ranging from formal at one end to extremely intimate at the other
#[[Illocutionary act|Illocutionary force]]: affirmative, imperative, interrogative
Polite particles are not used in conjunction with honorific registers or in written language.&lt;ref name= "Khan"/&gt;  Two commonly used polite particles&lt;ref name= "Smyth"/&gt; are summarized in the table below.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Thai 
! Sex
! Status of addressee
! Social mood
! Illocutionary force
|-
| ครับ ''khráp''
| male
| equal/superior
| formal
| affirmative/imperative/interrogative
|-
| ค่ะ ''khá''
| female
| equal/superior
| formal
| affirmative/interrogative
|}

==Other==
===Thao===
'''Thao  ({{lang|th|ท้าว}})''' "'''[[Lord]]'''" or "Lady", was formerly used as synonymous with [[Thai royal and noble titles#Phraya|Thai royal and noble title ''phraya'']], as made clear in expressions such as ''thao phraya'' ({{lang|th|ท้าวพระยา}})  and ''pen thao pen phraya'' ({{lang|th|เป็นท้าวเป็นพระยา}}).&lt;ref name="JSS_071_0g"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RID 1999 select ท and enter ท้าว&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Chan and Mook|Thao Thepkrasattri]], [[Chan and Mook|Thao Seesunthon]], and [[Thao Suranaree]] are famous [[heroine]]s in Thai history, but theirs is an honorific, not a feudal title. Pronounced with a high tone, it is similar in sound to falling tone ''thao'' ({{lang|th|เฒ่า phonemic Thai /เท่า/}}), "elder".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/133190 Thai-language.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter may be used as a pronoun when speaking to or about an elder, but should not be confused with the former.

===Si/Sri===
'''Sri''' ({{lang|th|ศรี}}) is pronounced '''Si''' and usually so transcribed. ''Sri'' and ''Si'' derive from the Sanskrit honorific [[Sri]], but occur in Thai as a part of a personal name, such as [[Worawongsathirat|Bun Si]] ({{lang|th|บุญศรี}}); or as part of a place name such as [[Ayutthaya (city)|Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya]].

'''Fr. Vasco do Rego SJ''' (born 8 January 1925) is a [[nonagenarian]] [[Jesuit]] priest from the region of [[Goa]], who has played a significant role in the promotion of [[Konkani]] language, literature and music, particularly  after the end of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] rule in the area, post-1961. He has been editor of the religious monthly [[Dor Mhoineachi Rotti]] for a long stint.

==Role played==
Rego is credited with playing an important role in translating the [[Old Testament]] into Konkani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A priest for all seasons|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/A-priest-for-all-seasons/articleshow/23065723.cms|website=TimesOfIndia.indiatimes.com|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Konkani sacred music==
{{see also|Konkani liturgical music}}
Writing in the ''Herald'' newspaper, journalist Melvyn Misquita says it was a "humiliating experience" that led Rego to compose "Goa's first Konkani Carol in 1963 and hundreds of original Konkani hymns, including a lengthy 18-verse hymn on St [[Francis Xavier]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Misquita|first1=Melvyn|title=The Sound Of Konkani Gospel Music|url=http://www.heraldgoa.in/Review/The-Sound-Of-Konkani-Gospel-Music/82173.html|website=heraldgoa.in|publisher=Herald|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fr. Rego contributed many hymns in the [[Gaionancho Jhelo]].

In January 2015, at the time of the canonisation of [[Joseph Vaz]], the first [[Goan]] saint, in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]], Rego was credited with writing the lyrics to the hymn ''Jose Vaza, Amchea Bhava'' (Jose Vaz, Our Brother), which was put to music by Fr. Joaquim Loiola Pereira. This hymn was sung&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernandes|first1=Paul|title=Konkani hymn ends multilingual ceremony|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Konkani-hymn-ends-multilingual-ceremony/articleshow/45892116.cms|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Mass where [[Pope Francis]] elevated the [[Goan]] missionary who worked in [[Ceylon]] to the altar and which can be heard at about 2:30:48 into this recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass for Canonisation of Joseph Vaz, with Pope Francis 14 January 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7_9mr_Ehg|website=YouTube|publisher=Catholic Sat|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site song-from-goa.at&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Noronha|first1=Lourenço|title=GOENCHIM KOKNNI GAIONAM, CANÇÕES GOESAS EM KONKANI, SONGS FROM GOA IN KONKAN|url=http://www.songs-from-goa.at/info14-music-with-staffnotation.html|website=songs-from-goa.at|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a number of sheet-music versions of the work of Rego.

In March 2016, the [[nonagenarian]] Rego was credited with being one of the four - two priests, and as many musicians: Fr Ubald Fernandes, Fr Vasco Rego SJ, [[Schubert Cotta]] and [[Roque Lazarus]] - responsible for writing the lyrics of the [[Konkani]] film ''Enemy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goanews|first1=Newsdesk|title=Bhosle's 'Enemy?' bags National Award for Konkani film|url=http://www.goanews.com/news_disp.php?newsid=7104|website=Goanews|publisher=Goanews (Sandesh Prabhudesai)|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In [[Goa]], he is credited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paladka|first1=Ancy|title=Rev. Fr. Vasco do Rego, S.J baggs Dalgado Puroskar 2005|url=http://www.konkanuae.com/home/displaynews.asp?id=1062|website=konkanuae.com|publisher=KonkanUAE|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with playing a major role in the fields of [[Bible translations into Konkani]] and liturgical translation, building a [[Konkani]] religious vocabulary, composing hymns both in lyrics and music for [[Konkani]], and developing the world of [[Konkani]] preaching and writing in the [[Konkani in the Roman script|Roman script of Konkani]].

==Long-time Jesuit==
He has been a member of the [[Society of Jesus]], or the [[Jesuits]] since 1945, was ordained priest in [[Belgium]] in 1955, and was inspired by his [[theologian]]-[[teacher]] Fr [[Pierre Charles]], S.J. to use the [[Konkani]] language and music in the liturgy of the people in [[Goa]], where [[Konkani]] is a widely spoken language.

Rego was the Rector of Goa's famed [[Bom Jesus Basilica]], where the remains of [[saint]] [[Francis Xavier]] reside, during which period many prominent global figures visited this shrine, among them being [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]], [[President]] [[Mario Soares]] of [[Portugal]], [[Russia]]n and [[India]]n [[cosmonaut]]s and [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref name="Brother"&gt;{{cite web|last1=do Rego|first1=Fernando|title=A Tribute at Eighty-Eight|url=http://goanet-news.goanet.narkive.com/HxTPv005/goanet-reader-a-tribute-at-eighty-eight-fernando-do-rego-panjim|website=Goanet News|publisher=Goanet Reader|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rego is the grandson of Roque and Claudina Correia Afonso, a couple who had seven priests among their 52 grandchildren.&lt;ref name="Brother" /&gt; His brother is Fernando do Rego.

==First awardee==
He was the first awardee, in 2005, of the [[Dalgado Konknni Akademi]]'s Mgrs. [[Sebastião Rodolfo Dalgado|Dalgado]] Puroskar, an award for serving the [[Konkani]] language for some four years.

'''William of Ockham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|k|əm}}; also '''Occam''', from {{lang-la|Gulielmus Occamus}};&lt;ref&gt;[[John Jortin|Jortin, John]]. ''Remarks on Ecclesiastical History, Volume 3''. p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Jacob Hofmann]]. ''Lexicon universale, historiam sacram et profanam omnis aevi omniumque...'' p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; {{circa}} 1287 – 1347) was an [[England|English]] [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]] and theologian, who is believed to have been born in [[Ockham, Surrey|Ockham]], a small village in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;There are claims also that he was born in Ockham, Yorkshire but it is now accepted that his birth place was in Surrey. See {{Cite book | publisher = [[Purdue University]] Press | isbn = 978-1-55753-097-4 | last = Wood | first = Rega | title = Ockham on the Virtues | year = 1997| pages = 3, 6–7n1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be one of the major figures of [[Medieval philosophy|medieval thought]] and was at the centre of the major intellectual and political controversies of the 14th century. He is commonly known for [[Occam's razor]], the methodological principle that bears his name, and also produced significant works on [[logic]], [[physics]], and [[theology]]. In the [[Church of England]], his day of commemoration is 10 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx | title=Holy Days | publisher=Church of England |work=Liturgical Calendar | accessdate= May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
William of Ockham was born in [[Ockham, Surrey]] in 1285 and joined the [[Franciscan]] order at an early age.&lt;ref name="English Literature p 735"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that he studied theology at the [[University of Oxford]]&lt;ref name=Spade20&gt;Spade, Paul Vincent (ed.). ''The Cambridge Companion to Ockham''. Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merton&gt;He has long been claimed as a [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] alumnus, but there is no contemporary evidence to support this claim and as a Franciscan, he would have been ineligible for fellowships at Merton (see G. H. Martin and J. R. L. Highfield, ''A History of Merton College'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 53). The claim that he was a pupil of [[Duns Scotus]] at Oxford is also disputed (see Philip Hughes, ''History of the Church: Volume 3: The Revolt Against The Church: Aquinas To Luther'', Sheed and Ward, 1979, p. 119 n. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; from 1309 to 1321,&lt;ref&gt;During that time (1312–1317) [[Henry Harclay]] was the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of Oxford and it is believed that William was his pupil (see John Marenbon (ed.), ''Medieval Philosophy'', Routledge, 2003, p. 329).&lt;/ref&gt; but while he completed all the requirements for a master's degree in theology, he was never made a [[regent master]].&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/| title=William of Ockham| publisher=Stanford University |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Spade, Paul Vincent | accessdate=2006-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, he acquired the honorific title ''Venerabilis Inceptor'', or "Venerable Beginner" (an ''inceptor'' was a student formally admitted to the ranks of teachers by the university authorities).&lt;ref name="Brundage"&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Middle Ages]], theologian [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]'' (1150) had become a standard work of theology, and many ambitious theological scholars wrote commentaries on it.&lt;ref name="Roger Olson p. 350"&gt;Olson, Roger E. (1999). ''The Story of Christian Theology'', p. 350. {{ISBN|0-8308-1505-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; William of Ockham was among these scholarly commentators. However, William's commentary was not well received by his colleagues,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} or by the Church authorities.  In 1324, his commentary was condemned as unorthodox by a [[synod]] of bishops,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and he was ordered to [[Avignon]], France, to defend himself before a papal court.&lt;ref name="Roger Olson p. 350"/&gt;

An alternative understanding, recently proposed by George Knysh, suggests that he was initially appointed in Avignon as a professor of philosophy in the Franciscan school, and that his disciplinary difficulties did not begin until 1327.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knysh |first=George |title=Biographical rectifications concerning William's Avignon period |journal=Franciscan Studies |volume=46 |year=1986 |pages=61–91 |jstor=41975065 |doi=10.1353/frc.1986.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally believed that these charges were levied by [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Oxford chancellor]] [[John Lutterell]].&lt;ref name="hundersmarck"&gt;{{cite book

A theological commission had been asked to review his ''Commentary on the Sentences'', and it was during this that William of Ockham found himself involved in a different debate. Michael of Cesena had asked William to review arguments surrounding [[Apostolic poverty]]. The Franciscans believed that [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] and his [[apostles]] owned no property either individually or in common, and the Rule of Saint Francis commanded members of the order to follow this practice.&lt;ref name="mcgrade"&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
  | year = 1974
  | isbn = 0-521-20284-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought them into conflict with [[Pope John XXII]].

Because of the pope's attack on the Rule of Saint Francis, William of Ockham, [[Michael of Cesena]] and other leading Franciscans fled Avignon on 26 May 1328, and eventually took refuge in the court of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis IV of Bavaria]], who was also engaged in dispute with the papacy, and became William's patron.&lt;ref name="Roger Olson p. 350"/&gt; After studying the works of John XXII and previous papal statements, William agreed with the Minister General. In return for protection and patronage William wrote treatises that argued for emperor Louis to have supreme control over church and state in the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Roger Olson p. 350"/&gt; "On June 6, 1328, William was officially excommunicated for leaving Avignon without permission,"&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; and William argued that John XXII was a heretic for attacking the doctrine of Apostolic poverty and the Rule of Saint Francis, which had been endorsed by previous popes.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; However it should be noted that William of Ockham's philosophy was never officially condemned as heretical.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

He spent much of the remainder of his life writing about political issues, including the relative authority and rights of the spiritual and temporal powers. After [[Michael of Cesena]]'s death in 1342, William became the leader of the small band of Franciscan dissidents living in exile with Louis IV. William of Ockham died (prior to the outbreak of the plague) on 9 April 1347.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gál |first=Gedeon |year=1982 |title=William of Ockham Died 'Impenitent' in April 1347 |journal=Franciscan Studies |volume=42 |pages=90–95 |jstor=41974990 |doi=10.1353/frc.1982.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially rehabilitated by [[Innocent VI]] in 1359{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.

==Faith and reason==
William of Ockham espoused [[fideism]], stating that "only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover."&lt;ref&gt;Dale T. Irvin and Scott W. Sunquist. ''History of World Christian Movement'' Volume I: Earliest Christianity to 1453, p. 434. {{ISBN|9781570753961}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that science was a matter of discovery and saw God as the only ontological necessity.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; His importance is as a theologian with a strongly developed interest in logical method, and whose approach was critical rather than system building.&lt;ref name="English Literature p 735"/&gt;

==Philosophical thought==
[[File:Guillelmus - Quaestiones in quattuor libros sententiarum - 4417303 Carta 25r.tif|thumb|''Quaestiones in quattuor libros sententiarum'']]
In [[scholasticism]], William of Ockham advocated reform in both method and content, the aim of which was simplification. William incorporated much of the work of some previous theologians, especially [[Duns Scotus]]. From Duns Scotus, William of Ockham derived his view of divine omnipotence, his view of grace and justification, much of his epistemology{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and ethical convictions&lt;ref&gt;Lucan Freeport, ''Basis of Morality According to William Ockham'', {{ISBN|0819909181}}, {{ISBN|9780819909183}}, Franciscan Herald Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, he also reacted to and against Scotus in the areas of predestination, penance, his understanding of universals, his formal distinction {{lang|la|ex parte rei}} (that is, "as applied to created things"), and his view of parsimony which became known as [[Occam's Razor]].

===Nominalism===
William of Ockham was a pioneer of [[nominalism]], and some consider him the father of modern [[epistemology]], because of his strongly argued position that only individuals exist, rather than supra-individual [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]], essences, or forms, and that universals are the products of abstraction from individuals by the human mind and have no extra-mental existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann  | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied the real existence of metaphysical universals and advocated the reduction of [[ontology]]. William of Ockham is sometimes considered an advocate of [[conceptualism]] rather than nominalism, for whereas nominalists held that universals were merely names, i.e. words rather than extant realities, conceptualists held that they were mental [[concept]]s, i.e. the names were names of concepts, which do exist, although only in the mind. Therefore, the universal concept has for its object, not a reality existing in the world outside us, but an internal representation which is a product of the understanding itself and which "supposes" in the mind the things to which the mind attributes it; that is, it holds, for the time being, the place of the things which it represents. It is the term of the reflective act of the mind. Hence the universal is not a mere word, as [[Roscellinus|Roscelin]] taught, nor a ''sermo'', as [[Peter Abelard]] held, namely the word as used in the sentence, but the mental substitute for real things, and the term of the reflective process. For this reason William has sometimes also been called a "terminist", to distinguish him from a nominalist or a conceptualist.&lt;ref name="Turner1913"&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia| year=1913|wstitle = William of Ockham | author =William Turner|inline=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William of Ockham was a theological [[Voluntarism (theology)|voluntarist]] who believed that if God had wanted to, he could have become incarnate as a donkey or an ox, or even as both a donkey and a man at the same time. He was criticized for this belief by his fellow theologians and philosophers.&lt;ref name="grenz"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Named God and the Question of Being: A Trinitarian Theo-Ontology|author= Stanley J. Grenz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficient reasoning===
One important contribution that he made to modern science and modern intellectual culture was efficient reasoning with the principle of parsimony in explanation and theory building that came to be known as [[Occam's Razor]]. This maxim, as interpreted by [[Bertrand Russell]],&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Russell
  | first = Bertrand
  | title = History of Western Philosophy
  | publisher = [[Allen &amp; Unwin]]
  | year = 2000
  | pages = 462–463
  | isbn = 0-415-22854-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that if one can explain a phenomenon without assuming this or that hypothetical entity, there is no ground for assuming it, i.e. that one should always opt for an explanation in terms of the fewest possible causes, factors, or variables. He turned this into a concern for ontological parsimony; the principle says that one should not multiply entities beyond necessity – {{lang|la|Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate}} – although this well-known formulation of the principle is not to be found in any of William's extant writings.&lt;ref name="thorburn"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Occam%27s_Razor | title=The Myth of Occam's Razor| journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] | author=W. M. Thorburn | volume = 27 | issue = 107 | pages = 345–353 | year = 1918 | doi = 10.1093/mind/XXVII.3.345 | accessdate=2006-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formulates it as: "For nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;Spade, Paul Vincent (ed.). ''The Cambridge Companion to Ockham''. Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; For William of Ockham, the only truly necessary entity is God; everything else is contingent. He thus does not accept the [[principle of sufficient reason]], rejects the distinction between essence and existence, and opposes the [[Thomism|Thomistic doctrine]] of active and passive intellect. His scepticism to which his ontological parsimony request leads appears in his doctrine that human reason can prove neither the immortality of the soul; nor the existence, unity, and infinity of God. These truths, he teaches, are known to us by revelation alone.&lt;ref name="Turner1913"/&gt;

===Natural philosophy===
William wrote a great deal on [[natural philosophy]], including a long commentary on [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'']]&lt;ref&gt;André Goddu, ''The Physics of William of Ockham'', {{ISBN|9004069127}}, {{ISBN|9789004069121}}, Brill Academic Pub., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the principle of ontological parsimony, he holds that we do not need to allow entities in all ten of Aristotle's categories; we thus do not need the category of quantity, as the mathematical entities are not "real". Mathematics must be applied to other categories, such as the categories of substance or qualities, thus anticipating modern scientific renaissance while violating Aristotelian prohibition of ''metabasis''.

===Theory of knowledge===
In the theory of knowledge, William rejected the scholastic theory of species, as unnecessary and not supported by experience, in favour of a theory of abstraction. This was an important development in late medieval [[epistemology]]. He also distinguished between intuitive and abstract cognition; intuitive cognition depends on the existence or non-existence of the object, whereas abstractive cognition "abstracts" the object from the existence predicate. Interpreters are, as yet, undecided about the roles of these two types of cognitive activities.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

===Political theory===
William of Ockham is also increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to the development of Western constitutional ideas, especially those of government with limited responsibility.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;William of Ockham (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy): [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ockham/#8 Stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first medieval authors to advocate a form of church/state separation,&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; and was important for the early development of the notion of property rights. His political ideas are regarded as "natural" or "secular", holding for a secular absolutism.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; The views on monarchical accountability espoused in his ''Dialogus'' (written between 1332 and 1347)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/ockdial.html|title=British Academy – William of Ockham: Dialogus|website=www.britac.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; greatly influenced [[Conciliarism|the Conciliar movement]] and assisted in the emergence of liberal democratic ideologies.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

William argued for complete separation of spiritual rule and earthly rule&lt;ref&gt;Takashi Shogimen, ''Ockham and Political Discourse in the Late Middle Ages'' [1 ed.], {{ISBN|0521845815}}, {{ISBN|9780521845816}}, Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. He thought that the pope and churchmen have no right or grounds at all for secular rule like having property, citing 2 Tim. 2:4. That belongs solely to earthly rulers, who may also accuse the pope of crimes, if need be.&lt;ref name=vm&gt;Virpi Mäkinen, ''Keskiajan aatehistoria'', Atena Kustannus Oy, Jyväskylä, 2003, {{ISBN|9517963106}}, {{ISBN|9789517963107}}. Pages 160, 167–168, 202, 204, 207–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Fall God had given men, including non-Christians, two powers: private ownership and the right to set their rulers, who should serve the interest of the people, not some special interests. Thus he preceded [[Thomas Hobbes]] in formulating [[social contract]] theory along with earlier scholars.&lt;ref name=vm/&gt;

William of Ockham said that the Franciscans avoided both private and common ownership by using commodities, including food and clothes, without any rights, with mere ''usus facti'', the ownership still belonging to the donor of the item or to the pope. Their opponents such as pope [[John XXII]] wrote that use without any ownership cannot be justified: "''It is impossible that an external deed could be just if the person has no right to do it.''" &lt;ref name=vm/&gt;

Thus the disputes on the heresy of Franciscans led William of Ockham and others to formulate some fundamentals of economic theory and the theory of ownership.&lt;ref name=vm/&gt;

===Logic===
In [[logic]], William of Ockham wrote down in words the formulae that would later be called [[De Morgan's Laws]],&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Summa Logicae'', part II, sections 32 and 33.Translated on page 80 of ''Philosophical Writings'', tr. P. Boehner, rev. S. Brown, (Indianapolis, IN, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and he pondered [[ternary logic]], that is, a [[logical system]] with three [[truth values]]; a concept that would be taken up again in the [[mathematical logic]] of the 19th and 20th centuries. His contributions to [[semantics]], especially to the maturing theory of [[supposition]], are still studied by logicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Graham |last1=Priest |authorlink1=Graham Priest |last2=Read |first2=S. |title=The Formalization of Ockham's Theory of Supposition |journal=Mind |volume=LXXXVI |pages=109–113 |year=1977 |doi=10.1093/mind/LXXXVI.341.109 |url=http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/LXXXVI/341/109.full.pdf+html?sid=c98343a3-49ab-4711-83ce-8418cc417280 |issue=341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink1=John Corcoran (logician) |first1=John |last1=Corcoran |first2=John |last2=Swiniarski |year=1978 |title=Logical Structures of Ockham's Theory of Supposition |journal=Franciscan Studies |volume=38 |pages=161–83 |jstor=41975391 |doi=10.1353/frc.1978.0010}}&lt;/ref&gt; William of Ockham was probably the first logician to treat empty terms in Aristotelian syllogistic effectively; he devised an empty term semantics that exactly fit the syllogistic. Specifically, an argument is valid according to William's semantics if and only if it is valid according to ''Prior Analytics''.&lt;ref&gt;John Corcoran (1981). "Ockham's Syllogistic Semantics", ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', '''46''': 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary Ockhamism/nominalism==
William of Ockham and his works have been discussed as a possible influence on several late medieval literary figures and works, especially [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], but also [[Jean Molinet]], the [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|''Gawain'']] poet, [[François Rabelais]], [[John Skelton]], [[Julian of Norwich]], the York and Townely Plays, and Renaissance romances. Only in very few of these cases is it possible to demonstrate direct links to William of Ockham or his texts. Correspondences between Ockhamist and Nominalist philosophy/theology and literary texts from medieval to postmodern times have been discussed within the scholarly paradigm of [[literary nominalism]].&lt;ref&gt;William H. Watts and Richard J. Utz, "Nominalist Influence on Chaucer's Poetry: A Bibliographical Essay," ''Medievalia &amp; Humanistica'' 20 n.s. (1993), 147–73; Helen Ruth Andretta, ''Chaucer's 'Troilus and Criseyde.' A Poet's Response to Ockhamism'' (New York: Lang, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmus, in his ''Praise of Folly'', criticized him together with Duns Scotus as fuelling unnessary controversies inside the Church.

==Works==
The standard edition of the philosophical and theological works is: ''William of Ockham: Opera philosophica et theologica'', Gedeon Gál, et al., eds. 17&amp;nbsp;vols. St. Bonaventure, N. Y.: The [[Saint Bonaventure University|Franciscan Institute]], 1967–88.

The seventh volume of the ''Opera Philosophica'' contains the doubtful and spurious works.

The political works, all but the ''Dialogus'', have been edited in H. S. Offler, et al., eds. ''Guilelmi de Ockham Opera Politica'', 4 vols., 1940–97, Manchester: Manchester University Press [vols. 1–3]; Oxford: Oxford University Press [vol. 4].

'''Yoruba''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|j|ɒr|ʊ|b|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;Yor.&lt;/small&gt; ''{{lang|yo|èdè Yorùbá}}'') is a language spoken in [[West Africa]]. The number of speakers of Yoruba is approaching 30 million.&lt;ref name="NE100" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Metzler Lexikon Sprache'' (4th ed. 2010) estimates roughly 30 million based on earlier estimates and population growth figures&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[pluricentric language]] spoken principally in [[Benin]] and [[Nigeria]], with communities in Sierra Leone, Liberia other parts of Africa, the [[Americas]], and [[Europe]]. The non-vernacular remains of the language, [[Lucumi language|Lucumi]], is the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Santería]] religion of the [[Caribbean]]. Many Yoruba words are used in the Afro-Brazilian religion known as [[Candomblé]]. Yoruba is also used in many other [[Afro-American religions]] in the [[Americas]] and the [[Caribbean]]. Yoruba is most closely related to the [[Itsekiri language|Itsekiri]] language (spoken in the Niger Delta) and to [[Igala language|Igala]] (spoken in central Nigeria).&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|yor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{further|Volta–Niger languages|Benue–Congo languages}}
Yoruba is classified among the [[Edekiri languages]], which together with [[Itsekiri language|Itsekiri]] and the isolate [[Igala language|Igala]] form the [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] group of languages within the [[Volta–Niger languages|Volta–Niger]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family.
The linguistic unity of the Niger–Congo family dates to deep prehistory, estimates ranging around 15,000 years ago (the end of the [[Upper Paleolithic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Heine|first1=Bernd|authorlink1=Bernd Heine|last2=Nurse| first2=Derek|authorlink2=Derek Nurse|title=African Languages: An Introduction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=C7XhcYoFxaQC&amp;pg=PA294|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66629-9|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; In present-day Nigeria, it is estimated that there are over 40 million Yoruba primary and secondary language speakers as well as several other millions of speakers outside Nigeria, making it the most widely spoken African language outside Africa.

The Yoruba group is assumed to have developed out of undifferentiated Volta–Niger populations by the 1st millennium BC. Settlements of early Yoruba speakers are assumed to correspond to those found in the wider Niger area from about the 4th century BC, especially at [[Ife]]. 
The North-West Yoruba dialects show more linguistic innovation than the Southeast and Central dialects. This, combined with the fact that the latter areas generally have older settlements, suggests a later date for migration into Northwestern Yorubaland.&lt;ref&gt;Adetugbọ 1973:192-3. (See also the section [[#Dialects|Dialects]].)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Kay Williamson]] Scale, the following is the degree of relationship between Itsekiri and other Yoruboid dialects, using a compiled word list of the most common words. A similarity of 100% would mean a total overlap of two dialects, while a similarity of 0 would mean two speech areas that have absolutely no relationship.

|}

The result of the wordlist analysis shows that Itsekiri bears the strongest similarity to the SEY dialects and most especially Ilaje and Ikale, at 80.4% and 82.3% similarity. According to the language assessment criteria of the international Language Assessment Conference (1992), only when a wordlist analysis shows a lexical similarity of below 70% are two speech forms considered to be different languages. An overlap of 70% and above indicates that both speech forms are the same language, although dialect intelligibility tests would need to be carried out to determine how well speakers of one dialect can understand the other speech form.
Thus while the analysis shows that Igala, with an overlap of 60% is a completely different language, all other Yoruboid speech forms are merely dialects of the same Language.

== Varieties ==
The Yoruba [[dialect continuum]] itself consists of several dialects. The various Yoruba dialects in the Yorubaland of Nigeria can be classified into five major dialect areas: Northwest, Northeast, Central, Southwest and Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;This widely followed classification is based on Adetugbọ's (1982) dialectological study; the classification originated in his 1967 PhD thesis ''The Yoruba Language in Western Nigeria: Its Major Dialect Areas''. See also Adetugbọ 1973:183-193.&lt;/ref&gt; Clear boundaries cannot be drawn, peripheral areas of dialectal regions often having some similarities to adjoining dialects.

North-West Yoruba is historically a part of the [[Oyo Empire|Ọyọ Empire]]. In NWY dialects, Proto-Yoruba velar fricative {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and labialized voiced velar /gʷ/ have merged into /w/; the upper vowels /ɪ/ and /ʊ/ were raised and merged with /i/ and /u/, just as their nasal counterparts, resulting in a vowel system with seven oral and three nasal vowels.

South-East Yoruba was probably associated with the expansion of the [[Benin Empire]] after c. 1450.&lt;ref&gt;Adetugbọ 1973:185.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to NWY, lineage and descent are largely [[lineal descendant|multilineal]] and [[cognatic]], and the division of titles into war and civil is unknown. Linguistically, SEY has retained the /ɣ/ and /gw/ contrast, while it has lowered the nasal vowels /ĩ/ and /ʊ̃/ to /ɛ̃/ and /ɔ̃/, respectively. SEY has collapsed the second and third person plural pronominal forms; thus, ''àn án wá'' can mean either 'you (pl.) came' or 'they came' in SEY dialects, whereas NWY for example has ''ẹ wá'' 'you (pl.) came' and ''wọ́n wá'' 'they came', respectively. The emergence of a plural of respect may have prevented coalescence of the two in NWY dialects.

Central Yoruba forms a transitional area in that the lexicon has much in common with NWY, and it shares many ethnographical features with SEY. Its vowel system is the least innovating (most stable) of the three dialect groups, having retained nine oral-vowel contrasts and six or seven nasal vowels and an extensive vowel harmony system. Peculiar to Central and Eastern (NEY, SEY) Yoruba also, is the ability to begin words with the vowel [ʊ:] which in Western Yoruba has been changed to [ɪ:]

== Literary Yoruba ==
Literary Yoruba, also known as ''Standard Yoruba'', ''Yoruba koiné'', and ''common Yoruba'', is a separate member of the dialect cluster. It is the written form of the language, the standard variety learned at school and that spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when [[Samuel A. Crowther]], the first African Bishop, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. Though for a large part based on the Ọyọ and Ibadan dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for example the following remark by Adetugbọ (1967, as cited in Fagborun 1994:25): "While the orthography agreed upon by the missionaries represented to a very large degree the phonemes of the Abẹokuta dialect, the morpho-syntax reflected the Ọyọ-Ibadan dialects".&lt;/ref&gt; It also has some features peculiar to itself, for example the simplified [[vowel harmony]] system, as well as foreign structures, such as [[calque]]s from English which originated in early translations of religious works.

Because the use of Standard Yoruba did not result from some deliberate linguistic policy, much controversy exists as to what constitutes 'genuine Yoruba', with some writers holding the opinion that the Ọyọ dialect is the most "pure" form, and others stating that there is no such thing as genuine Yoruba at all. Standard Yoruba, the variety learnt at school and used in the media, has nonetheless been a powerful consolidating factor in the emergence of a common Yoruba identity.

== Writing system ==
{{see also|Nigerian braille#Yoruba Braille}}

In the 17th century{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Yoruba was written in the [[Ajami script]], a form of [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref&gt;"Yoruba...written in a version of the Arabic script known as Ajami (or Ajamiyya)."[https://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/afs/NigerianSurveyTour2007/NigerianSurveyTour.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Yoruba orthography originated in the early work of [[Church Mission Society]] missionaries working among the ''Aku'' (Yoruba) of Freetown. One of their [[informant (linguistics)|informants]] was Crowther, who later would proceed to work on his native language himself. In early grammar primers and translations of portions of the English Bible, Crowther used the Latin alphabet largely without tone markings. The only diacritic used was a dot below certain vowels to signify their [[open vowel|open]] variants {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, viz. {{angbr|ẹ}} and {{angbr|ọ}}. Over the years the orthography was revised to represent tone among other things. In 1875, the Church Missionary Society (CMS) organised a conference on Yoruba Orthography; the standard devised there was the basis for the orthography of the steady flow of religious and educational literature over the next seventy years.

The current orthography of Yoruba derives from a 1966 report of the Yoruba Orthography Committee, along with Ayọ Bamgboṣe's 1965 ''Yoruba Orthography'', a study of the earlier orthographies and an attempt to bring Yoruba orthography in line with actual speech as much as possible. Still largely similar to the older orthography, it employs the [[Latin alphabet]] modified by the use of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|gb}} and certain [[diacritic]]s, including the traditional vertical line set under the letters {{angbr|e̩}}, {{angbr|o̩}}, and {{angbr|s̩}}. In many publications the line is replaced by a dot {{angbr|ẹ}}, {{angbr|ọ}}, {{angbr|ṣ}}. The vertical line had been used to avoid the mark being fully covered by an [[underline]].

|}

The Latin letters {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|q}}, {{angbr|v}}, {{angbr|x}}, {{angbr|z}} are not used.

The pronunciation of the letters without diacritics corresponds more or less to their [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] equivalents, except for the [[labial–velar consonant]] {{IPA|[k͡p]}} (written {{angbr|p}}) and {{IPA|[ɡ͡b]}} (written {{angbr|gb}}), in which both consonants are pronounced simultaneously rather than sequentially. The diacritic underneath vowels indicates an [[open vowel]], pronounced with the [[advanced and retracted tongue root|root of the tongue retracted]] (so {{angbr|ẹ}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ̙]}} and {{angbr|ọ}} is {{IPA|[ɔ̙]}}). {{angbr|ṣ}} represents a [[postalveolar consonant]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}} like the English {{angbr|sh}}, {{angbr|y}} represents a [[palatal approximant]] like English {{angbr|y}}, and {{angbr|j}} a [[voiced palatal stop]] {{IPA|[ɟ]}}, as is common in many African orthographies.

In addition to the vertical bars, three further diacritics are used on vowels and syllabic [[nasal consonant]]s to indicate the language's tones: an [[acute accent]] {{angbr|'''´'''}} for the high tone, a [[grave accent]] {{angbr|'''`'''}} for the low tone, and an optional [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] {{angbr|'''¯'''}} for the middle tone. These are used in addition to the line in {{angbr|ẹ}} and {{angbr|ọ}}. When more than one tone is used in one syllable, the vowel can either be written once for each tone (for example, *{{angbr|òó}} for a vowel {{IPA|[o]}} with tone rising from low to high) or, more rarely in current usage, combined into a single accent. In this case, a [[caron]] {{angbr|ˇ}} is used for the rising tone (so the previous example would be written {{angbr|ǒ}}) and a [[circumflex]] {{angbr|ˆ}} for the falling tone.

In Benin, Yoruba uses a different orthography. The Yoruba alphabet was standardized along with other Benin languages in the [[National Languages Alphabet (Benin)|National Languages Alphabet]] by the National Language Commission in 1975, and revised in 1990 by the National Center for Applied Linguistics.

== Phonology ==
The three possible syllable structures of Yoruba are consonant+vowel (CV), vowel alone (V), and syllabic nasal (N). Every syllable bears one of the three tones: high {{angle bracket|◌́}}, mid  {{angle bracket|◌̄}} (generally left unmarked), and low {{angle bracket|◌̀}}. The sentence ''n̄ ò lọ'' (''I didn't go'') provides examples of the three syllable types:
*n̄ — {{IPA|[ŋ̄]}} &amp;mdash; ''I''
*ò &amp;mdash; {{IPA|[ò]}} — ''not'' (negation)
*lọ &amp;mdash; {{IPA|[lɔ̄]}} — ''to go''

=== Vowels ===
Standard Yoruba has seven oral and five nasal vowels. There are no diphthongs in Yoruba; sequences of vowels are pronounced as separate syllables. Dialects differ in the number of vowels they have; see [[#Varieties|above]].

[[File:Yoruba vowel chart.svg|thumb|Yoruba [[vowel#Articulation|vowel]] diagram, adopted from Bamgboṣe (1969:166). Oral vowels are marked by black dots, while the coloured regions indicate the ranges in possible quality of the nasal vowels.]]

* In some cases, the phonetic realization of these vowels is noticeably different from what the symbol suggests:
** The oral {{IPA|/i/}} is close front {{IPAblink|i}}, and the nasal {{IPA|/ĩ/}} varies between close front {{IPAblink|i|ĩ}} and near-close front {{IPAblink|ɪ|ĩ̞}}.&lt;ref name="bam166"&gt;Bamgboṣe (1969:166)&lt;/ref&gt;
** The oral {{IPA|/u/}} is close back {{IPAblink|u}}, and the nasal {{IPA|/ũ/}} varies between close near-back {{IPAblink|u|ũ̟}}, close back {{IPAblink|u|ũ}}, near-close near-back {{IPAblink|ʊ|ũ̟˕}} and near-close back {{IPAblink|ʊ|ũ̞}}.&lt;ref name="bam166"/&gt;
** The oral {{IPA|/e, o/}} are close-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|e}}, {{IPA link|o}}]}}, and do not have nasal counterparts.&lt;ref name="bam166"/&gt;
** The oral {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is open-mid {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɛ}}]}}, and the nasal {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} varies between mid {{IPAblink|ɛ̝|ɛ̝̃}} and open-mid {{IPAblink|ɛ|ɛ̃}}.&lt;ref name="bam166"/&gt;
** The oral {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is near-open {{IPAblink|ɒ|ɔ̞}}, and the nasal {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} varies between open-mid {{IPAblink|ɔ|ɔ̃}} and near-open {{IPAblink|ɒ|ɔ̞̃}}.&lt;ref name="bam166"/&gt;
** The oral {{IPA|/a/}} is central {{IPAblink|ä}}.&lt;ref name="bam166"/&gt;

The status of a fifth nasal vowel, {{IPA|[ã]}}, is controversial. Although the sound occurs in speech, several authors have argued it to be not phonemically contrastive; often, it is in free variation with {{IPA|[ɔ̃]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Notably, Ayọ Bamgboṣe (1966:8).&lt;/ref&gt; Orthographically, nasal vowels are normally represented by an oral vowel symbol followed by {{angle bracket|n}} ({{angle bracket|in}}, {{angle bracket|un}}, {{angle bracket|ẹn}}, {{angle bracket|ọn}}), except in case of the {{IPA|[n]}} allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} (see [[#Consonants|below]]) preceding a nasal vowel: ''inú'' 'inside, belly' is actually pronounced {{IPA|[īnṹ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, in his ''Dictionary of Modern Yoruba'', deviates from this by explicitly indicating the nasality of the vowel; thus, ''inú'' is found under ''inún'', etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- vowel harmony should be treated --&gt;

The voiceless plosives {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are slightly aspirated; in some Yoruba varieties, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are more dental. The [[rhotic consonant]] is realized as a flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or, in some varieties (notably Lagos Yoruba), as the [[alveolar and postalveolar approximants|alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}}.

Like many other languages of the region, Yoruba has the [[voiceless labial–velar stop|voiceless]] and [[voiced labial–velar stop]]s {{IPA|/k͡p/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ͡b/}}: ''pápá'' {{IPA|[k͡pák͡pá]}} 'field', ''{{lang|yo|gbogbo}}'' {{IPA|[ɡ͡bōɡ͡bō]}} 'all'. Notably, it lacks the common [[voiceless bilabial stop]] {{IPA|/p/}} so {{IPA|/k͡p/}} is written as {{angle bracket|p}}.

Yoruba also lacks a [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/n/}}; the letter {{angle bracket|n}} is used for the sound in the orthography, but strictly speaking, it refers to an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/l/}} immediately preceding a nasal vowel.

There is also a [[syllabic consonant|syllabic nasal]], which forms a [[syllable#nucleus|syllable nucleus]] by itself. When it precedes a vowel, it is a velar nasal {{IPA|[ŋ]}}: ''n ò lọ'' {{IPA|[ŋ ò lɔ̄]}} 'I didn't go'. In other cases, its place of articulation is [[homorganic consonants|homorganic]] with the following consonant: ''ó ń lọ'' {{IPA|[ó ń lɔ̄]}} 'he is going', ''ó ń fò'' {{IPA|[ó ḿ fò]}} 'he is jumping'.

=== Tone ===
Yoruba is a [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]] with three level tones: high, low, and mid (the default tone.&lt;ref&gt;Several authors have argued that the mid-tone is [[underspecification|not specified underlyingly]] but rather is assigned by a ''default rule'' (Pulleyblank 1986, Fọlarin 1987, Akinlabi 1985): &lt;br /&gt;rí 'see'   aṣọ 'clothing' → ráṣọ 'see clothing', contrasted with rí 'see'   ọ̀bẹ 'knife' → rọ́&lt;sup&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt;bẹ 'see a knife'&lt;br /&gt;In the first example, the final vowel of the verb ''rí'' is deleted but its high tone easily attaches to the first syllable of ''aṣọ'', the mid tone of which disappears without a trace. In the second example, the Low tone of the first syllable of ''ọ̀bẹ'' is not as easily deleted; it causes a [[downstep]] (marked by {{angle bracket|&lt;sup&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt;}}, a lowering of subsequent tones. The ease with which the Mid tone gives way is attributed to it not being specified underlyingly. Cf. Bamgboṣe 1966:9 (who calls the downstep effect 'the assimilated low tone').&lt;/ref&gt;) Every syllable must have at least one tone; a syllable containing a long vowel can have two tones&lt;!-- this of course is just a more layman-friendly way of saying that the mora is the tone bearing unit --&gt;. Contour tones (i.e. rising or falling tone melodies) are usually analysed as separate tones occurring on adjacent tone bearing units ([[Mora (linguistics)|morae]]) and thus have no phonemic status.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bamgboṣe 1966:6: ''The so-called glides […] are treated in this system as separate tones occurring on a sequence of two syllables.''&lt;/ref&gt; Tones are marked by use of the acute accent for high tone ({{angle bracket|á}}, {{angle bracket|ń}}), the grave accent for low tone ({{angle bracket|à}}, {{angle bracket|ǹ}}); Mid is unmarked, except on syllabic nasals where it is indicated using a macron ({{angle bracket|a}}, {{angle bracket|n̄}}); 
see [[#Tone markings|below]]). Examples:
* H: ó bẹ́ [ó bɛ́] 'he jumped'; síbí [síbí]  'spoon'
* M: o bẹ [ó bɛ̄] 'he is forward'; ara [āɾā] 'body'
* L: ò bẹ̀ [ó bɛ̀] 'he asks for pardon'; ọ̀kọ̀  [ɔ̀kɔ̀] 'spear'.

=== Tonality effects and computer-coded documents ===
Written Yoruba includes [[diacritic|diacritical marks]] not available on conventional computer keyboards, requiring some adaptations. In particular, the use of the subdots and tone marks are not represented, so many Yoruba documents simply omit them. Asubiaro Toluwase, in his 2014 paper,&lt;ref&gt;Asubiaro, Toluwase V. (2014) Effects of Diacritics on Web Search Engines' Performance for Retrieval of Yoruba Documents. Journal of Library and Information Studies 12 (1), 1-19&lt;/ref&gt; points out that the use of these diacritics can affect the retrieval of Yoruba documents by popular search engines. Therefore, their omission can have a significant impact on online research.

==== Assimilation and elision ====
When a word precedes another word beginning with a vowel, assimilation or deletion ('[[elision]]') of one of the vowels often takes place.&lt;ref&gt;See Bamgboṣe 1965a for more details. See also Ward 1952:123–133 ('Chapter XI: Abbreviations and Elisions').&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, since syllables in Yoruba normally end in a vowel, and most nouns start with one, it is a very common phenomenon, and it is absent only in very slow, unnatural speech. The orthography here follows speech in that word divisions are normally not indicated in words that are contracted as a result of assimilation or elision: ''ra ẹja'' → ''rẹja'' 'buy fish'. Sometimes however, authors may choose to use an inverted comma to indicate an elided vowel as in ''ní ilé'' → ''n'ílé'' 'in the house'.

Long vowels within words usually signal that a consonant has been elided word-internally. In such cases, the tone of the elided vowel is retained: ''àdìrò'' → ''ààrò'' 'hearth'; ''koríko'' → ''koóko'' 'grass'; ''òtító'' → ''òótó'' 'truth'.

== Grammar ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Yoruba is a highly-[[isolating language]].&lt;ref&gt;Karlsson, F. ''Yleinen kielitiede.'' ("General linguistics") Helsinki: Helsinki University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Its basic constituent order is [[subject–verb–object]],&lt;ref name="RowlandsEvan"&gt;Rowlands, Evan Colyn. (1969). Teach Yourself Yoruba. English Universities Press: London.&lt;/ref&gt; as in ''ó nà Adé'' 'he beat Adé'. The bare verb stem denotes a completed action, often called perfect; tense and aspect are marked by preverbal particles such as ''ń'' 'imperfect/present continuous', ''ti'' 'past'. Negation is expressed by a preverbal particle ''kò''. [[Serial verb construction]]s are common, as in many other languages of West Africa.

Although Yoruba has no [[grammatical gender]],&lt;ref&gt;Ogunbowale, P. O. (1970). The Essentials of the Yoruba Language. University of London Press: London.&lt;/ref&gt; it has a distinction between human and non-human nouns. Probably a remainder of the noun class system of Proto-Niger–Congo, the distinction is only apparent in the fact that the two groups require different [[interrogative]] particles: ''tani'' for human nouns ('who?') and ''kini'' for non-human nouns ('what?'). The associative construction (covering [[possessive]]/genitive and related notions) consists of juxtaposing nouns in the order modified-modifier as in ''inú àpótí'' {inside box} 'the inside of the box', ''fìlà Àkàndé'' 'Akande's cap' or ''àpótí aṣọ'' 'box for clothes'.&lt;ref&gt;(Bamgboṣe 1966:110, Rowlands 1969:45-6)&lt;/ref&gt; More than two nouns can be juxtaposed: ''rélùweè abẹ́ ilẹ̀'' (railway under ground) 'underground railway', ''inú àpótí aṣọ'' 'the inside of the clothes box'. In the rare case that it results in two possible readings, disambiguation is left to the context.  Plural nouns are indicated by a plural word.&lt;ref name="RowlandsEvan" /&gt;

There are two 'prepositions': ''ní'' 'on, at, in' and ''sí'' 'onto, towards'. The former indicates location and absence of movement, and the latter encodes location/direction with movement.&lt;ref&gt;(Sachnine 1997:19)&lt;/ref&gt; Position and direction are expressed by the prepositions in combination with spatial relational nouns like ''orí'' 'top', ''apá'' 'side', ''inú'' 'inside', ''etí'' 'edge', ''abẹ́'' 'under', ''ilẹ̀'' 'down', etc. Many of the spatial relational terms are historically related to body-part terms.

==Arabic influence==
In his works such as ''Islam in Africa - West African in Particular, and Missionary and Colonization in Africa'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Abu-Abdullah Adelabu]] at [[AWQAF Africa]] Damascus titled: Islam in Africa - West African in Particular, and Missionary and Colonization in Africa see Al-Arab Daily Newspaper, London July, 1998 {{ISSN link|0140-010X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu-Abdullah Adelabu]] used assertions like these to argue that Islam had reached [[sub-Saharan Africa]], including the Yoruba territory in West Africa, as early as the first century [[Hijri year|Hijri]] through Muslim traders and expeditions during the reign of [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] (622–683) whose Islamic conquests under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] reached the [[Maghreb]], including present-day [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Morocco]].

The wide adoption of imported religions and civilizations such as Islam and Christianity has managed to lay impacts both on written and spoken Yoruba. In his ''Arabic-English Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Quran and Sunnah'', Adelabu argued Islam has enriched African languages by providing them with technical and cultural augmentations with [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Somali language|Somali]] in East Africa and [[Hausa language|Turanci Hausa]] and [[Wolof language|Wolof]] in West Africa the most beneficiaries. Adelabu, a Ph&amp;nbsp;D graduate from Damascus cited—among many other common usages—the following words to be Yoruba's derivatives of Arabic vocabularies:&lt;ref&gt;DELAB International Newsmagazine, November 2005 {{ISSN link|1465-4814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some loanwords===
*''alaafia'': Good, fine, or health(y), from {{lang-ar|العافي}}
*''Sanma'': Heaven or sky, from {{lang|ar|السماء}}
*''alubarika'': blessing, from {{lang|ar| البركة}}
*''wakati'': hour or time, from {{lang|ar|وقت}}
*''alubosa'': onion, from {{lang|ar|االبصل}}
*''adua'' or ''adura'': prayer or supplication, from {{lang|ar|الدعاء}}, see [[dua]]
*''asiri'': secret or hidden, from '{{lang|ar|السرّ}}
*''esin'': horse, from {{lang|ar|حصان}}
*''alumaani'': wealth, money, resources, from {{lang|ar|المال}}

Among commonly Arabic words used in Yoruba are names of the days such as ''Atalata'' ({{lang|ar|الثلاثاء}}) for Tuesday, ''Alaruba'' ({{lang|ar|الأربعاء}}) for Wednesday, ''Alamisi'' ({{lang|ar|الخميس}}) for Thursday, and ''Jimoh'' ({{lang|ar|الجمعة}}, [[Jumu'ah]]) for Friday. By far ''Ojo Jimoh'' is the most favourably used. It is usually preferred to the unpleasant word for Friday, ''Eti'', which means failure, laziness or abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;A lecture by Abu-Abdullah Adelabu of AWQAF Africa, London titled: The History Of Islam in 'The Black History' DELAB International Newsmagazine, April 2003 {{ISSN link|1465-4814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the standard words for the days of the week are Aiku, Aje, Isegun, Ojoru, Ojobo, Eti, Abameta, for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday respectively.
