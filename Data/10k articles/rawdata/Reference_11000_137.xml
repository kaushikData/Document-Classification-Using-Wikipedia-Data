Before being overturned, the ''Anastasoff'' decision was cited by multiple courts that used unpublished opinions in their decisions, such as ''United States v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1269">In '''''Anderson v Estate Anderson''''', an important case in the [[Law of succession in South Africa|South African law of succession]], the [[testator]] had [[bequeath]]ed a farm to his four sons, subject to a ''fideicommissum'' in favour of their eldest sons to the fourth generation, and subject to the limitation that any son selling his share was bound to sell to the remaining sons or son.

The court held that, where a son is given a [[fiduciary]] interest in property under his father's [[Will and testament|will]], the son's interest ceases upon his death and he cannot dispose of it by will. Furthermore, a sale of such share does not free it from the ''fideicommissum''. A clause disqualifying any son who became insolvent from obtaining a right under the will did not operate to disqualify an insolvent who was a fideicommissary under the will but who was rehabilitated before the right of succession accrued to him. Thus a condition that the bequest will lapse if the beneficiary becomes insolvent is not ''contra bonos mores''.

Based on [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, the '''Anima Sola''' or Lonely Soul is an image depicting a soul in [[purgatory]], popular in Latin America, as well as much of [[Andalusia]], [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]].

==Brief history==
While scholars have thus far not provided a history of the Anima Sola (or ''Ánimas del purgatorio'' in Spanish), the practice of praying for the souls in Purgatory extends at least as far back as the [[Council of Trent]] in which the following was determined:

"Whereas the Catholic Church, instructed by the [[Holy Ghost]], has from the Sacred Scriptures and the ancient tradition of the Fathers taught in Councils and very recently in this Ecumenical synod (Sess. VI, cap. XXX; Sess. XXII cap.ii, iii) that there is a purgatory, and that the souls therein are helped by the suffrages of the faithful, but principally by the acceptable [[Mass (liturgy)|Sacrifice of the Altar]]; the Holy Synod enjoins on the Bishops that they diligently endeavor to have the sound doctrine of the Fathers in Councils regarding purgatory everywhere taught and preached, held and believed by the faithful" (Denzinger, "Enchiridon", 983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Purgatory |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |first=Edward |last=Hanna |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |location=New York |year=1911 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various interpretations of the image==
The Anima Sola is taken to represent a soul suffering in purgatory. While in many cases chromolithographs depict a female soul, many other figures such as [[popes]] and other men are commonly depicted in chromolithographs, sculptures and paintings. In the most commonly known image of the Anima Sola, a woman is depicted as breaking free from her chains in a dungeon setting surrounded by flames, representing purgatory. She appears penitent and reverent, and her chains have been broken, an indication that, after her temporary suffering, she is destined for heaven.

Praying to the Anima Sola is a tradition in many ways unlike that of the more widespread [[cult of saints]]. In lieu of praying to a saint who then appeals to God, the Anima Sola represents souls in purgatory who require the assistance both of the living and the divine to ameliorate their sufferings in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the shadow of Vesuvius: a cultural history of Naples |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnM1g0oKkN0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+naples&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M1gjTIm8NcKSOJXu9bkF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=purgatory&amp;f=false |first=Jordan |last=Lancaster |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-85043-764-2 |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anima Sola is common throughout much of the Catholic world, though is perhaps strongest in Naples, where it is referred to as "the cult of the souls in Purgatory." In Latin America, one source reports,  the Anima Sola is "a belief still deeply rooted in the mass of the [[campesino (disambiguation)|campesino]]s. The devotion dates from the first colonizers, who probably brought the image in which the soul is represented as a woman suffering torments in purgatory with chains binding her hands. A legend concerning the 'thirst of Christ', about which Scripture seems to say nothing, passes from [[oral tradition|mouth to mouth]]: They say that in [[Jerusalem]], there were women who gave drink to those who were being [[crucifixion|crucified]]. On the afternoon of [[Good Friday]] it fell to a young woman, Celestina Abdenago, to go up [[Calvary]]. From a jar she gave a drink to [[Dismas]] and [[Gestas]], yet she despised the Saviour; and for that reason, he condemned her to suffer thirst and the constant heat of purgatory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cibertol.com/mitos/elanimasola.htm |title=El Anima Sola |publisher=Cibertol.com |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magical traditions==
As with many Catholic symbols, the image is also appears in spiritist traditions.  As described in ''The Element Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells'' by [[Judika Illes]]:

{{quote|Anima Sola translates as the "lone soul" or "lonely spirit" and refers to a very specific votive image. Based on Roman Catholic votive statues (but now a standardized chromolithograph), this image is particularly popular in Latin American magical traditions. It depicts a woman standing amidst flames, eternally burning yet never consumed. She gazes upwards, holding her chained hands towards heaven. Is her soul burning in the fire of Hell or does her heart burn with the fire of love?

Allegedly unrequited love is what drew this poor soul into her predicament: the Anima Sola traded eternal salvation for the joys of temporal love. She is invoked in only the most desperate love spells.&lt;ref name="5000 Spells"&gt;{{cite book |last=Illes |first=Judika |title=The Element Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells |year=2004 |publisher=Element Books|location=London |isbn=978-0-00-716465-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another interpretation is that the sacred figures most frequently invoked include the "Lonely Soul" [Anima Sola], who requires prayers because of her predicament; San Silvestre, magical because of the date of his feast day; and Santa Elena and San Onofre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft396nb1w0&amp;chunk.id=0&amp;doc.view=print |title=Cultural Encounters: The Impact of the Inquisition in Spain and the New World |editor1-last=Perry |editor1-first=Mary Elizabeth |editor2-last=Cruz |editor2-first=Anne J. |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-520-07098-1 |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santería and Lukumi==
In [[Santería]] or Lukumi, the Afro-Caribbean religion of [[Cuba]], there is a syncretization of the Anima Sola with the [[Eshu]] Alleguana.  The Eshus are the Divine Messengers, the Tricksters, The Masters of the Roads and the Doors that are necessary for all prayers to reach their intended point.  Eshu Allegwanna, one Eshu among hundreds, is thought to be the oldest of the Eshus, and to have existed on the Earth since a primordial time long before not only people, but before many of the gods of the religion, existed in the world.  Therefore, he is synchronized with The Lonely Spirit, as many of the African Gods were synchronized with Catholic saints, or hidden behind them, in the first centuries of slavery, when the practice of the African religions were oppressed.  Anima Sola is grouped in a triad in some traditions with The Intranquil Spirit and the Dominant Spirit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6578">'''Attributional ambiguity''' is a [[Social psychology|psychological]] [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] concept describing the difficulty that members of [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] or negatively [[stereotype]]d [[Social group|groups]] may have in interpreting [[feedback]]. According to this concept,  a person who perceives him- or herself as stigmatized can attribute negative feedback to prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Crocker |first1= Jennifer |authorlink1= |last2= Major |first2= Brenda |authorlink2= |last3= Stelle |first3= Claude |editor1-first= Daniel T. |editor1-last= Gilbert |editor1-link= |editor2-first= Susan T. |editor2-last= Fiske |editor3-first= Gardner |editor3-last= Lindzey |title= The Handbook of Social Psychology |url= |edition= 4th |series= |volume= Volume Two |year= 1998 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-521376-8 |page= |pages= 519&amp;ndash;521 |chapter= Social Stigma |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=w27pSuHLnLYC&amp;pg=PA519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead stigmatized group members to feel uncertainty about whether negative outcomes are due to discrimination against them or their own behavior. In comparison, they might discredit positive feedback as a form of sympathy rather than seeing it as the result of their ability and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Whiteley |first1= Bernard E. |authorlink1= |last2= Kite |first2= Mary E. |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=mXSJEjl4uZYC&amp;pg=PA428 |edition= 2nd |series= |volume= |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth Cengage Learning]] |location= Belmont, CA |isbn= 978-0-495-59964-7 |page= |pages= 428&amp;ndash;435 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Jennifer Crocker]], [[Brenda Major]] and their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Crocker et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Crocker |first1= Jennifer |last2= Voelkl |first2= Kristin |last3= Testa |first3= Maria |last4= Major |first4= Brenda |year= 1991 |title= Social stigma: The affective consequences of attributional ambiguity |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume= 60 |issue= 2 |pages= 218&amp;ndash; 228|publisher= |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.218 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Attributional ambiguity can have unfortunate repercussions for members of stigmatized groups.&lt;ref name="Crocker et al."/&gt; Members of groups that are ‘stereotype-vulnerable’ or are often stereotyped are at greater risk of having less self-worth through the lens of attributional ambiguity. With this concept, when people of an often stigmatized group receive feedback, they are unsure what the basis is for that feedback and believe it could have been attributed to things other than performance alone. Whether it is positive or negative feedback they face uncertainty about how accurate that feedback was and thus feeling uncertain about how to interpret the responses.

In the absence of true feedback one cannot totally rely on that evaluation and thus cannot adjust their behavior or performance accordingly. Attributional ambiguity can be applied in a very broad sense, considering how often people seek feedback. In academics, athletics, relationships, etc. are all areas in which feedback can be pivotal. For example, if it is known that a manager is very sensitive to his/her subordinates’ feelings, and he/she gives positive feedback, it is unclear if that feedback was true or simply an action of sensitivity.

==Empirical support==
In an experiment conducted by Jennifer Crocker, Brenda Major and colleagues, women who were evaluated unfavorably by a blatantly prejudiced evaluator experienced less negative affect than women who were rated unfavorably by an unbiased evaluator. With [[African American]] participants, it was found that when reviewed negatively African Americans were more likely to attribute the evaluator's negativity to prejudice than were white participants. Furthermore, African Americans were likely to attribute both negative and positive reviews to prejudice if they could be seen by the evaluator. Being visible (and thus vulnerable to being stereotyped based on race) helped African Americans cope with negative reviews, but also made them more likely to discredit positive reviews.&lt;ref name="Crocker et al."/&gt;

The same concept can be applied not only to race, ethnicity, gender, etc., but appearance as well. The extent to which one views his/herself as attractive can affect how they perceive feedback. A study by Major, Carrington &amp; Carnevale (1984) found that, as described above, the attractive participants were less likely to believe positive feedback given to them, believing that the observer had an [[ulterior motive]]. When the observer could see the attractive participant, they doubted the true motive behind their positive feedback. Unattractive participants were more likely to believe positive feedback than were attractive participants. When an ulterior motive is possible, it is easier to discount the feedback whether it is positive or negative. (See also [[Lookism]].)

[[C. L. Hoyt]] and colleagues examined attributional ambiguity in [[Latino]] subjects as compared to white subjects. They found that when given a negative review Latino subjects were more likely to attribute this negativity to the prejudice of the examiner than white subjects. They also found that when given a positive review, Latino subjects were more likely to discredit the positivity of the reviewer and experience a lower sense of well being than their white counterparts. This research suggests that while attributional ambiguity can be used as a buffer to protect the self from negative reviews and biased thoughts, it can also prevent stigmatized groups from embracing reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hoyt, C.L.|author2= Aguilar, L.|author3=Kaiser, C.

A '''''bomoh''''' is a Malay [[Shamanism|shaman]] and traditional medicine practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Graham Harvey|author2=Robert J. Wallis|title=Historical Dictionary of Shamanism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQOyAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|date=5 February 2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6459-7|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used mainly in [[Malaysia]] and parts of [[Sumatra]], whereas most [[Indonesia]]ns use the word ''[[dukun]]''. It is often mistranslated into English as [[medicine man]] or [[witch doctor]]. In colloquial usage, the term ''bomoh'' is often interchangeable with another type of shaman, the [[pawang]], but they generally serve different functions. The ''bomoh'' is primarily a healer, herbalist, geomancer, and sorcerer. The ''pawang'' on the other hand usually specialises in rituals involving weather, nature, animals, and a good harvest. Their roles do overlap however, and both act as an intermediary for the spirits and gods.

==Etymology==
The word ''bomoh'' (at times spelled ''bomo'' or ''bomor'') has been in common usage since at least classical times. It is a [[cognate]] of the [[Thai language|Thai]] term ''maw'' or ''mohr''. This word can mean either doctor or a sorcerer, as in terms like ''mawpii'' (spirit doctor) and ''mawduu'' (fortune-teller). Prior to the later introduction of the English-derived "doktor" or the Arabic word "tabib", the ''bomoh'' served as healers and physicians in Malay society. Thai shamans or ''bomoh Siam'' are traditionally held in high regard in Malaysia. Malay texts such as the Hikayat Aceh (1600-1625) record the word ''bomoh'' simply as ''mo'' or ''moh''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcp.anu.edu.au/N/Aceh_bib.html Hikayat Aceh]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
::Hikayat Aceh 127:7 "... gajah tuanku ini. Diperhamba suruh ubati kepada [bo]mo gajah tuanku. Berilah makanannya."

::Hikayat Aceh 127:7 "... this king's elephant. The king asked it to be treated by the elephant [bo]moh. Give it food."

==Background==
Shamanism in [[Southeast Asia]] can be traced to the region's prehistoric tribal people. The ''bomoh's'' original role was that of a healer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edwin R. Van Teijlingen|author2=George W. Lowis|author3=Peter McCaffery|author4=Maureen Porter|title=Midwifery and the Medicalization of Childbirth: Comparative Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DHrH08bl5YC&amp;pg=PA243|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-59454-031-8|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their expertise was first and foremost an in-depth knowledge of medicinal herbs and [[tajul muluk]] or Malay geomancy. This was supplemented by [[Sanskrit]] ''mantera'' ([[mantra]]) owing to the ancient [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] influence in the region. Before European colonisation, ''bomoh'' - along with [[bhikku|Buddhist monks]] and Hindu holymen - were often exempt from paying taxes, due to the fact that many of them had few material belongings.

===Modern era===
The ''bomoh's'' craft remained largely unchanged even after Islam became dominant until the [[Islamic revival]] in the 1970s and 80s. ''Bomoh'' were then seen as deviant from the Muslim faith because of their invocation of spirits and the potentially harmful black magic they were accused of practicing. This period saw a drastic decline in traditional herbalism and many fraudulent practitioners filled the void. As a result, ''bomoh'' are today looked at with suspicion even though they are still commonly consulted for personal reasons. Many ''bomoh'' today have tried to adapt their practice in the context of modern Islam, such as reciting verses of the Quran or invoking the names of Allah, but this is viewed as shallow by conservative shamans.

==Cosmology and function==
Malay metaphysical theory holds that the body, and in fact the universe itself, is made up of the four [[classical element]]s of fire, water, earth, and wind. Illnesses are often said to be caused by an imbalance of these elements. To restore this balance, patients are advised to bathe in cool water to which lime juice is added. The ''bomoh'' also works with rituals and incantations, called ''jampi''.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Malayan Medicine, {{ISBN|0-19-638149-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirits===
Some ''bomoh'' use [[cemetery|cemeteries]] to summon spirits to fulfill requests by supplicants, while others only deal with a single spirit. It is said that sometimes the ''bomoh'' selects the spirit, while other times, it is the spirit who selects the ''bomoh''. Spirits are said to be able to heal the sick, seek missing persons or even investigate reasons for bad luck. Spirits can also be used to attack people, cause sickness and misery and many other bad things. ''Bomo''h who have a particular religion may incorporate their religious practices into their craft.

Traditionally, healing rituals of some ''bomoh'' involved music and dance, such as the ''main puteri'' or ''main peteri'' (a trance-dance from [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]] often connected to [[mak yong]]), the ''main lukah'' (a fisherman's dance from [[Pahang]]), and the ''main saba'' (which re-enacts the heavenly princesses [''puteri kayangan''] dancing around a saba tree). The music is played by an assistant called the ''tuk minduk''.

==In popular culture==

=== The bomoh of the flight MH370 ===
In 2014, shortly after the disappearance of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]], Dato Mahaguru Ibrahim Mat Zin, who proclaimed himself as the ''Raja Bomoh'' (King of ''Bomoh'') with his male assistant, appeared in public offering to locate the missing plane by conducting a series of rituals at the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/raja-bomoh-at-klia-to-help-find-missing-plane-bernama|title=‘Raja Bomoh’ at KLIA to help find missing plane – Bernama|work=[[Bernama]]|publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]]|date=10 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022125538/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/raja-bomoh-at-klia-to-help-find-missing-plane-bernama|archivedate=22 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual involved using a pair of [[bamboo]] binoculars to view the inside of a traditional fish trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/03/10/missing-mh370-bomoh-vows-result-with-fish-trap-hook-bamboo-binocular/|title=Missing MH370: Bomoh vows result with fish trap hook, bamboo binocular|work=Bernama|publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|date=10 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim claimed that the plane was suspended in the air amongst three locations which were the [[Philippines]], [[South China Sea]] and on an unidentified country and it was hidden by the [[orang bunian|''orang-orang bunian'']] ("the Bunian", a supernatural race resembling humans, akin to elves in Malay legend).&lt;ref name="bomoh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/semasa/raja-bomoh-turut-bantu-cari-mh370-1.258857|title='Raja Bomoh' turut bantu cari MH370|author=Hasniza Hussain|language=Malay|publisher=[[Sinar Harian]]|date=10 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/missing-mas-flight-shaman-arrives-help-find-missing-plane|title=Missing MAS flight: Shaman arrives to help find missing plane|author1=Lavanya Lingan|author2=Hashini Kavishtri Kannan|work=[[New Straits Times]]|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|date=10 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside the ritual, Ibrahim Mat Zin also stated that 100,000 [[seni gayong]] martial artists had performed prayers for the missing plane and its passengers.&lt;ref name="bomoh" /&gt;

A few days later he and his four assistants, three males and one female came to KLIA, bringing along a water gourd, holy [[Zamzam Well|Zamzam water]] from [[Mecca]], a small surat [[Ya Sin]] book and several other items to conduct another ritual.&lt;ref name="bomoh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/mh370-malaysian-shaman-performs-ritual-help-find-missing-malaysian-airlines-flight-islamic-religious|title=MH370: Malaysian Shaman Performs Ritual To Help Find Missing Malaysian Airlines Flight, Islamic Religious Department Shuts It Down [VIDEO]|author=Dennis Lynch|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=13 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time, Ibrahim Mat Zin used two [[coconut]]s and knocked them against each other with his two bare hands while shouting [[takbir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/13/with-satellites-unsuccesful-in-plane-search-malaysian-shaman-tries-coconuts/|title=With satellites unsuccessful in plane search, Malaysian shaman tries coconuts|author=Terrence McCoy|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=13 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-26564562|title=#BBCtrending: Malaysia's 'Bomoh' and the superstitious search for MH370|author=Sam Judah|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=13 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, his three male assistants sat on the "magic carpet" and using a number of "magical artifacts" such as a walking stick, a basket and two coconuts, and thus started the infamous scene, while local and international photographers took a few shots. Ibrahim Mat Zin claimed that the purpose of the ritual is to weaken the spirits' hold on the plane.

The incidents drew international ridicule until it became a subject of an online game application called "Bomoh: Rescue Run" developed by a company named Triapps, which has surpassed more than 100,000 downloads in [[Google Play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/bomoh-inspired-app-gets-more-than-100000-downloads|title=Bomoh-inspired app gets more than 100,000 downloads|author=Pathma Subramaniam|publisher=[[The Malay Mail]]|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Youth and Sports (Malaysia)|Minister for Youth and Sports]] [[Khairy Jamaluddin]], who was not amused by the antics of the ''bomoh'', tweeted in regards to the incident: "Somebody should arrest those magic carpet bomohs.

He even resorted to contacting [[Jamil Khir Baharom|Jamil Khir]], The Minister for Islamic Affairs, to deal with the bomoh.&lt;ref name="cb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/03/12/Missing-MH370-arrest-bomoh-kj/|title=Missing MH370: Someone should arrest 'magic carpet bomohs', says Khairy|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Islam in Malaysia#Official religion|Malaysian Department of Islamic Advancement]] had issued a [[fatwa]] that Ibrahim Mat Zin's methods contradict Islamic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/03/12/Missing-MH370-Bomoh-not-islamic/|title=Missing MH370: Bomoh's methods contradict Islam, says Jakim|publisher=The Star|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some netizens had also pointed out the similarities of the antics of the ''bomoh'' with a scene in the [[P. Ramlee]] movie ''[[Laksamana Do Re Mi]]'' where the main characters ride on a flying mat, while the bamboo binoculars session once held by Ibrahim Mat Zin to locate the missing plane mimic Re's magic single vision binocular in the movie.&lt;ref name="cb" /&gt;

A '''browser speed test''' is a [[computer benchmark]] that scores the performance of a [[web browser]], by measuring the browser's efficiency in completing a predefined list of tasks. In general the testing software is available online, located on a website, where different algorithms are loaded and performed in the browser client. Typical test tasks are rendering and animation, [[Document Object Model|DOM]] transformations, string operations, mathematical calculations, [[sorting algorithms]], graphic performance tests and memory instructions.
Browser speed tests have been used during [[browser wars]] to prove superiority of specific web browsers. The popular [[Acid3]] test is no particular speed test but checks browser conformity to web standards (though it checks whether a general performance goal is met).

==General tests==

===Peacekeeper===
Peacekeeper is a platform-independent benchmark by [[Futuremark]] that tests rendering, mathematical and memory operations. It takes approx. 5 minutes for execution and tells the results of other browsers with different CPUs. Futuremark stopped maintaining Peacekeeper in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghacks.net/2015/07/23/futuremark-ends-support-for-peacekeeper-benchmark/|title=Futuremark ends support for Peacekeeper benchmark|last=Brinkmann|first=Martin|date=23 July 2015|publisher=Ghacks|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was taken offline in March 2018 and is no longer available.

===Speed-Battle===

{{italic title}}
'''''Cum universi'''''{{#tag:ref|The full title of the bull is ''Cum universe Christi jugo subjecti'' (Latin: ''With the yoke of Christ to all those subject'').&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson ||first=A. O. |date=July 1923 |title=The Bull "Cum Universi |journal=The Scottish Historical Review |volume=25 |issue=100 |pages=335–341 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]  |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} ({{lang-la|With the yoke}}) is a [[papal bull]] written by [[Pope Celestine III]], issued on 13 March 1192.{{#tag:ref|Some historians, such as Anderson, state that the authorship of the bull could also be attributed to [[Pope Clement III]].&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;|group=note}} The bull ended the claim of the [[Archbishop of York]] to metropolitan jurisdiction in [[Scotland]] and established an independent national church, albeit one with no figurehead.

== Background ==

{{See also|Christianity in Medieval Scotland}}

Before the bull's publication, the church in Scotland had no [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] authority by way of an [[archbishop]].&lt;ref name=Furguson&gt;{{cite book |last=Furguson |first=William |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=The Identity of the Scottish Nation: A Historic Quest |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |date=1 May 1998 |pages= |chapter= |isbn=0748610715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts had been made by [[Pope Paschal II]] in 1100 to attach the metropolitan authority of the Archbishop of York to Scotland&lt;ref name=Barrell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barrell |first1=A. D. M. |last2= |first2= |date=Autumn 1995 |title=The background to ''Cum universe'': Scoto-papal relations, 1159-1192 |journal=The Innes Review |volume=48 |issue=2|pages=116–138 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press  |doi=10.3366/inr.1995.46.2.116 |url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/pdfplus/10.3366/inr.1995.46.2.116|url-access=subscription |accessdate=30 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in his letter ''Noscat dilectio'',{{#tag:ref|Latin: ''He knows the love''.|group=note}} which he addresses "to the [[suffragans]] of the metropolis of York ''per Scotiam''".&lt;ref name=Cushnie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cushnieent.force9.co.uk/New%20Diocese/diocese_independance.htm |title=Independence of the Early Medieval Church |author=Cushnie Enterprises |date= |work= |publisher=Cushnie Enterprises |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Noscat dilectio'' was written on the promotion of [[Gerard (archbishop of York)|Gerard, Bishop of Hereford]] to the archbishopric of York, commanding the Scottish bishops to obey Gerard and accept his authority, which the Scottish bishops refused to do.&lt;ref name=Furguson /&gt;

On the consecration of [[Thurstan|Archbishop Thurstan of York]] by [[Pope Calixtus II]], a more vigorous campaign was mounted insisting York’s authority be recognised in Scotland. Although both Calixtus and successive popes commanded the obedience of the Scottish bishops to York, the bishops of [[Archbishop of St Andrews|St. Andrews]] and [[Archbishop of Glasgow|Glasgow]] refused, abetted by both King [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander]] and King [[David I of Scotland|David]].&lt;ref name=Cushnie /&gt;

In April 1125, [[Pope Honorius II]] wrote to King David commanding him to receive [[John of Crema|Cardinal John of Crema]] as [[papal legate]] to investigate the matter of the continued controversy with the metropolitan authority of the Archbishop Thurstan and the Scottish bishops.&lt;ref name=Barrell /&gt; The inquiry was fruitless and in 1126, the pope summoned the Scottish bishops to [[Rome]] during [[Lent]] 1127 for an inquiry on their relationship with York. The meeting was, however, aborted.&lt;ref name=Cushnie /&gt;

== Consecration of Scottish Bishops ==

During the controversy, when a Scottish bishop required [[consecration]] it should have been performed by the Archbishop of York.{{#tag:ref|This was by virtue of the Archbishop of York having metropolitan authority over the Scottish bishop's sees.|group=note}} Due to vacancies arising in both [[Episcopal see|sees]] concurrently, however, [[John Capellanus|Bishop John]] and his successor [[Herbert of Selkirk|Herbert]] were consecrated by the pope himself.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite book |last=|first=|editor-first=Anderson Allan |editor-last=Orr |title=Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers: A.D. 500 to 128 |publisher=BiblioLife, LLC |date=18 July 2009 |pages= |chapter= |isbn= 978-1-113-21606-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern then continued even when the See of York was not vacant, when Hubert’s successor, [[Enguerrand (bishop of Glasgow)|Engelram]], was consecrated by [[Pope Alexander III]]. Engelram’s successor, [[Jocelin of Glasgow|Jocelyn]] was consecrated at [[Clairvaux Abbey|Clairvaux]] by a papal legate.&lt;ref name=Dowden&gt;{{cite book |last=Dowden |first=John |editor-first= |editor-last=|title=The Bishops of Scotland |publisher=James Maclehose &amp; Sons |year=1912|edition=1st |pages=220 ''et seq''. |chapter= |asin=B0006AGIO6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rights established by the bull ==

The bull arose as a result of the controversy, and for the first time in the ecclesiastical history of Scotland, the church is referred to an entity (''Scotticana ecclesia''&lt;ref name=Barrell /&gt;), comprising the dioceses of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Dunkeld, Dunblane, Brechin, Aberdeen, Moray, Ross and Caithness.&lt;ref name=Barrell /&gt; The bull then goes on to outline the rights attached to the church:

* The church was a ‘special daughter’&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; of the [[apostolic see]] with no intermediary.&lt;ref name=Barrell /&gt;
* No one could impose an [[interdict]] in the kingdom of Scotland except the pope or his legate.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt; 
* No foreigner could be a legate in Scotland unless specifically sent by the pope.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;
* The liberties and realm and churches granted by previous popes were confirmed by Celestine.&lt;ref name=Barrell /&gt;
* Disputes which rose within the realm of Scotland could not be heard outside it, unless there was a direct appeal to the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name=Barrell /&gt;

The bull is viewed as a pivotal moment in the history of the [[mediæval Scottish church]] and instrumental in the removal of English influences in Scottish ecclesiastical affairs.&lt;ref name=Dowden /&gt;

'''David Hall''' (born December 16, 1916 in [[New Rochelle, New York]]; died April 10, 2012 in [[Castine, Maine]]) was a sound archivist and writer.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hall's parents were Fairfax and Eleanor Raeburn (Remy) Hall. He married Bernice Dobkin on June 8, 1940. Their children are Marion Hall Hunt, Jonathan Hall, [[Peter Dobkin Hall]], and Susannah Hall.

===Education===
After graduating from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], Hall received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Yale University]] in 1939. He was a postgraduate student at [[Columbia University]] from 1940-41.

===Career===
At the urging of family friend, ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]'' Editor [[Norman Cousins]], Hall abandoned his graduate studies to write an annotated discography of [[recorded sound]]. The book instructed record collectors on "how to lay a solid foundation for a record library, what pitfalls to avoid in the buying of records, whether or not it is advisable to specialize, and how to distinguish between fair and excellent recordings of the same composition" (Hall 1940). The book also provided tips on playback equipment and offered detailed commentary on the whole range of recorded music, from classical through experimental music, jazz, folk, and spoken word. ''The Record Book'' appeared in 1940 and was followed by a series of supplements, and international edition (1948). The last supplement appeared in 1950. The series was an immediate hit, selling more than 100,000 copies.

In 1940, Hall began a lifelong involvement with the record business, taking a job as an advertising copywriter with Columbia Records, then located in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1942, he became music program annotator for the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] -- the all-star orchestra conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]. In 1948, Hall joined forces with fellow Yale graduate [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] on a quest to post-war Europe on behalf of [[Mercury Records]], then a Chicago-based produced of "pop" material. 

Wishing to enter the growing classical music market, Mercury executives realized that radio stations and governments in formerly Nazi-occupied countries held a gold mine in superb performances by Europe's top musicians. Hammond's and Hall's objective was to acquire these assets for Mercury. Hammond had hired Hall, "a well-known authority on classical recording, to handle the considerable job of cataloging Czech and German material. He was known and respected by the Czechs, who were interested in establishing an international records archive. David would be an asset in delicate negotiations" (Hammond 1977, 282). Hall and Hammond left Prague one step ahead of Soviet forces as they crushed Czechoslovakia's democratic government.

Hall remained at Mercury Records until 1956 as classic music director. Under his leadership, Mercury began releasing its notable "Living Presence" series of classical recordings. Hall worked closely with sound engineering pioneer, C. Robert Fine. Fine's mobile sound studio toured the midwest, recording performances by the Detroit, Louisville, and Minneapolis symphonies and musical groups at the Eastman School at the University of Rochester. A 1955 recording of the Minneapolis Symphony performing [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' under the baton of [[Antal Doráti]] became the best selling classical record of the decade. 

In 1956, Hall was awarded a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Teaching Fellowship]], which enabled him to spend a year at the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) teaching advanced recording techniques to Danish engineers and musicians. Hall had long been interested in Scandinavian music, having directed the music center at New York's American Scandinavian Foundation from 1950 to 1957. 

On returning to the United States in the fall of 1957, Hall became music editor of ''Hi-Fi/Stereo Review'' (later ''Stereo Review''). Hall contributed reviews of classic music and articles to the magazine until it folded in 1998. In his writings, Hall championed [[contemporary music]]. His 1964 article on [[Charles Ives]] included the first full discography of Ives's recordings.

In 1963, Hall became president of Composers' Recordings, Inc., a nonprofit record label devoted to recording and distributing the work of contemporary composers. Among the notable recordings produced under his leadership were a series of performances by avant garde composer [[Harry Partch]]. 

In 1967, Hall was appointed curator of the [http://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa/rodgers-and-hammerstein-archives-recorded-sound Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound], one of the units of the New York Public Library's performing arts collections at Lincoln Center. There he pioneered new techniques of cataloging recorded material as one of the initiatives of the Research Libraries Group, a consortium of the nation's leading research libraries. Hall and his associates also released an important collection of historic sound recordings, ''The [[Mapleson Cylinders]]'', which captured the singing of [[Metropolitan Opera]] stars of the early twentieth century. This recording was given a [[Grammy Award]] by the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences in 1986. 

During this period, Hall helped to found the [[Association for Recorded Sound Collections]] (ARSC) in 1966. He served as the group's president, 1980-1982. In 2002, he received the ARSC Award for Distinguished Service to Historical Recordings. 

In 1986, Hall retired to the seaside village of Castine, Maine, where he continued to write record reviews and consult on recording projects.  Through the 1990s, he chaired the classical records awards committee for the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences. Late in life, Hall was at work on a biography of the twentieth century American composer, [[Roy Harris]].

In addition to introducing American audiences to the remarkable riches of recorded music in the years following the second World War, Hall played an especially important role as a champion of contemporary music. At least half the composers listed in the 1940 Record Book were still living. They included such notables as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Roy Harris]], [[Charles Ives]], [[Harry Partch]], [[William Schuman]],  and others. His writings also helped garner attention for jazz and folk musicians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13235">The '''destruction of Mosul Museum artifacts''' became publicly known on February 26, 2015 when the group known as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] released a video showing their destruction.

==Mosul Museum==
The [[Mosul Museum]], opened in 1952, is the second largest museum in Iraq, with the first being the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. The museum is split into four areas of focus: The Assyrian hall, the Hatrene hall, the Islamic hall, and the Prehistoric hall.

===Importance of the region===
Iraq's present day borders overlap with the historic extent of [[Mesopotamia]]. Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the first areas in which urbanization evolved, beginning around the 4th millennia B.C. The "city" became the center of the new social system, resulting in the need of centralized power.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistically, the land of Iraq holds evidence of the switch from stylized and schematic figures to more realistic representations of the human form. Writing evolved during this time period as well, allowing people to describe divine figures and conceptualize religion.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological efforts uncovered evidence of Mesopotamia as a world contemporary with the Bible, with many stories on cuneiform tablets describing versions of similar biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 22) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's understanding of Iraq and its history comes from the archaeological efforts that have taken place on its land. Because of a lack of visible architectural remains in the area, Mesopotamia, and Iraq in particular, are where the "treasure hunting" of old transformed into the beginnings of  the real archaeological research we know today. Archaeologists have been researching in Iraq for over a century and a half, lending us a great amount of time to truly understand the region's impact on those who live there and ultimately, the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[Huot, J. Louis (2008). The Importance of Iraq's Cultural Heritage. In P.G. Stone &amp; J.F. Bajjaly (Eds.), ''The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq'' (pp. 20) The Boydell press.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction (2015)==

===Contents of ISIL video===
In a video shared on February 26, 2015, ISIL entered the Mosul Museum with the purpose of destroying artifacts they deemed "idolatrous". Members of the group can be seen pushing over many statues, while using jackhammers and sledgehammers to damage the faces of others. A spokesperson appears in the beginning of the video, explaining the rationale behind the group's actions. The rationale pertains to the assumption that these objects (statues, figurines, etc.) were once worshiped instead of Allah.

A translation from the video is as follows: "These ruins that are behind me, they are idols and statues that people in the past used to worship instead of Allah. The so-called Assyrians and Akkadians and others looked to gods for war, agriculture and rain to whom they offered sacrifices…The Prophet Mohammed took down idols with his bare hands when he went into Mecca. We were ordered by our prophet to take down idols and destroy them, and the companions of the prophet did this after this time, when they conquered countries." &lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damage===
Not all of the museum's collection was damaged by ISIL. However, the most impacted were the Assyrian and Hatrene areas of the museum. The Islamic hall, which still held many priceless antiquities, was not shown in the video. The Prehistoric hall was also never shown, though most of those artifacts had been removed prior to the destruction.

====Assyrian====
*Nergal Gate: The Nergal Gate is located on the north side of [[Nineveh]], an ancient Mesopotamian city located in present-day Mosul. The gate was built sometime between 704 and 690 BC, which was a time of expansion for Nineveh under the ruler [[Sennacherib]]. The gate is related to the ancient Mesopotamian god [[Nergal]], who was associated with the summer solstice, war, destruction, and the netherworld.   
*Lamassu: At the Nergal Gate's entrance, and just within the entrance, stand the [[lamassu]]. These mythological figures first began appearing in art and architecture during the first half of the second millennium B.C., and are described as large winged human-headed bulls. Aside from being decoration, the lamassu are protective figures, more specifically described as "a benevolent spirit attached to an individual, group, a place or an entrance." The lamassu erected at the entrance of the Nergal Gate at Nineveh are surrounded by relief sculpture that depicts the stages of transport of the human-headed bulls from quarries in Balatai.&lt;ref&gt;[Danrey, V. (2004). Winged Human-Headed Bulls of Ninevah: Genesis of an Iconographic Motif. Papers of the 49th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale. Vol. 66, Ninevah.]&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 13 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + -Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's) &amp; Full Projection.2.JPG|thumb|Lamassu and Balawat Gate in the British Museum]]

Before the release of the ISIL video on February 26, 2015, the lamassu were in various states of preservation. Of the two figures at the entrance of the gate, one still had its upper portion preserved. The video shows an ISIL member jackhammering face of the lamassu at the right side of the gate. The left one was probably untouched, as it has been missing its upper portion since the late 19th century. The ones located inside the gates were less well-preserved than their counterparts at the entrance. However, both were seen being damaged by jackhammers and sledgehammers. The Assyrian section within the Mosul Museum also holds other lamassu of an earlier style. These may also have become damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Balawat Gates====
The Mosul Museum holds in its collection numerous bronze bands of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC). The bands are decorated with scenes of Assyrian war, hunt, and tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[J.E. Curtis &amp; N. Tallis. (2009). The Balawat gates of Ashurnasirpal II. In ''Journal of the American Oriental Society''. American Oriental Society. Vol. 129, No. 3. pp. 552-554.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Balawat Gates are of archaeological and historical significance because they are considered a "'major' find from a 'minor'" site.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt; Tell-Balawat, the site from which the Balawat Gates originate, was considered a small site in comparison to the neighboring Assyrian sites of Nineveh and Nimrud. Through further research, Tell-Balawat (also known as the city of Igmur-Enlil), was found to be within a "hollow-way" between Nineveh and Nimrud, suggesting that its purpose included defending these two cities.&lt;ref&gt;[Tucker, D.J. (1994). Representations of Igmur-Enlil on the Balawat Gates. In ''Iraq''. Vol. 56. pp. 107-116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The displayed bands are shown on ISIL's video, but it is unknown whether they were destroyed at that time. Because the Mosul Museum was previously looted in 2003, some of the bands were already missing. Since the bands are considered portable, it is assumed that some were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-1-the-assyrian-artifacts/ Assessing the Damage at the Mosul Museum, Part 1: The Assyrian Artifacts]&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum holds a second pair of the Balawat Gates, built during the reign of Shalmaneser III. These are well documented, and can be used to aid in the identification of the Ashurnasirpal's bands if they arise.

====Hatrene statues====
Hatra was an ancient city located between the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire, to the south of present-day Mosul. Its significance is great, as its historical and archaeological record indicate it was a wealthy trading city, influenced heavily by its neighboring peoples and empires. Hatra's artworks are of interest to scholars because they have been analyzed as hybrids of artistic styles from the West and East of the city. For example, a Hatrene statue of a seated goddess is described as having drapery consistent with Buddhist style, while also having the large, protruding eyes typical of Mesopotamian works.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, S. Said (1972). Hatra, Iraq. In ''Archaeology''. Archaeological Institute of America. Vol. 25, No. 2. pp. 103-111.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hercules Hatra Iraq Parthian period 1st 2nd century CE.jpg|thumb|Hatrene statue of Hercules]]

The Mosul Museum was home to a variety of Hatra's sculptures. Most of the sculptures were images of Hatrene kings or noblemen. The ISIL video shows many of these sculptures being hit with sledgehammers and toppled to the ground. Of the 27 known Hatrene sculptures of kings, 4 were seen damaged in the ISIL video. This represents a 15% loss of these sculptures that are known to be in existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gatesofnineveh.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/assessing-the-damage-at-the-mosul-museum-part-2-the-sculptures-from-hatra/ Assessing the Damange at the Mosul Museum, Part 2: The Sculptures from Hatra]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Questioned authenticity of damaged artifacts====
According to Iraqi archaeologists, some of the collection belonging to the Mosul Museum was moved to the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad six months prior to the release of the ISIL video. This spared many priceless artifacts from becoming damaged. Additionally, sources have suggested that a portion of the artifacts shown being damaged in the video were in fact reproductions or reconstructions. However, Iraqi archaeologists state this may not be the case entirely. Some artworks known to have been genuine were not shown in the video, leading archaeologists to believe that the portable objects were looted, while larger, non-portable objects were the only ones to be damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/full-story-isil-takeover-mosul-museum-150309053022129.html/ The full story behind ISIL's takeover of Mosul Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===

The 2003 looting of the National Museum of Iraq showed the cultural heritage community the extreme importance of documentation within a museum or archaeological setting. The National Museum of Iraq lacked a complete inventory, which includes photographs of all objects. The problem became exacerbated when salvaged archaeological materials came into the museum in the late 1990s until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The influx of artifacts made it very difficult for the staff to keep up with its documentation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajaonline.org/online-review-museum/364 Learning from the Iraq Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://professorhistoryx.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/what-isis-destroys-why-and-why-we-must-document-it-hyperallergic/ What ISIS Destroys, Why, and Why We Must Document It]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosul Museum may be in this same situation, though information on its documentation processes has not come to light. If photographs of their artifacts are in existence, they will be useful in identifying and recovering the looted artifacts.

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Dispute resolution''' is the process of resolving disputes between [[Party (law)|parties]]. The term ''dispute resolution'' may also be used interchangeably with ''[[conflict resolution]]'', where conflict styles can be used for different scenarios. 

==Methods==
Methods of dispute resolution include:
* [[lawsuit]]s (litigation)
* [[arbitration]]
* [[collaborative law]]
* [[mediation]]
* [[conciliation]]
* [[negotiation]]
* [[Facilitator|facilitation]]
One could theoretically include [[violence]] or even [[war]] as part of this spectrum, but dispute resolution practitioners do not usually do so; violence rarely ends disputes effectively, and indeed, often only escalates them. 

Dispute resolution processes fall into two major types:
# [[adjudication|Adjudicative]] processes, such as litigation or arbitration, in which a judge, jury or arbitrator determines the outcome.
# Consensual processes, such as collaborative law, mediation, conciliation, or negotiation, in which the parties attempt to reach agreement.

Not all disputes, even those in which skilled intervention occurs, end in resolution. Such [[intractable conflict|intractable]] disputes form a special area in dispute resolution studies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Dispute resolution is an important requirement in international trade, including negotiation, mediation, arbitration and litigation.&lt;ref&gt;''Global Business Environment'' (Fifth Edition) by FITT,

The [[legal system]] provides resolutions for many different types of disputes. Some disputants will not reach agreement through a collaborative process. Some disputes need the coercive power of the state to enforce a resolution. Perhaps more importantly, many people want a professional advocate when they become involved in a dispute, particularly if the dispute involves perceived legal rights, legal wrongdoing, or threat of legal action against them.

The most common form of judicial dispute resolution is litigation. Litigation is initiated when one party files suit against another. In the United States, litigation is facilitated by the government within federal, state, and municipal courts. The proceedings are very formal and are governed by rules, such as rules of evidence and procedure, which are established by the legislature. Outcomes are decided by an impartial [[judge]] and/or [[jury]], based on the factual questions of the case and the application law. The verdict of the court is binding, not advisory; however, both parties have the right to appeal the judgment to a higher court. Judicial dispute resolution is typically adversarial in nature, for example, involving antagonistic parties or opposing interests seeking an outcome most favorable to their position.   

Retired judges or private lawyers often become arbitrators or mediators; however, trained and qualified non-legal dispute resolution specialists form a growing body within the field of [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR). In the United States, many states now have mediation or other ADR programs annexed to the courts, to facilitate settlement of lawsuits.

==Extrajudicial dispute resolution==
Some use the term ''dispute resolution'' to refer only to [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR), that is, extrajudicial processes such as arbitration, collaborative law, and mediation used to resolve conflict and potential conflict between and among individuals, [[business]] entities, governmental agencies, and (in the [[public international law]] context) [[Sovereign state|states]]. ADR generally depends on agreement by the parties to use ADR processes, either before or after a dispute has arisen. ADR has experienced steadily increasing acceptance and utilization because of a perception of greater flexibility, costs below those of traditional litigation, and speedy resolution of disputes, among other perceived advantages. However, some have criticized these methods as taking away the right to seek redress of grievances in the [[court]]s, suggesting that extrajudicial dispute resolution may not offer the fairest way for parties not in an equal bargaining relationship, for example in a dispute between a [[consumer]] and a large [[corporation]]. In addition, in some circumstances, arbitration and other ADR processes may become as expensive as litigation or more so.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

A '''ditloid''' is a type of [[word puzzle]],&lt;ref name="Ditloids" /&gt; in which a phrase, quotation, date, or fact must be deduced from the numbers and abbreviated letters in the clue. Common words such as 'the', 'in', 'a', 'an', 'of', 'to', etc. are not normally abbreviated.&lt;ref name="Ditloids"&gt;http://www.ditloids.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2013}} The name 'ditloid' was given by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper,&lt;ref name=Ditloids /&gt; originating from the clue: 1 = DitLoID ≡ ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich|1 Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.

==History==
[[Will Shortz]] originated the current form of this puzzle and first published it in the May–June 1981 issue of [[Games Magazine|''Games'' magazine]], calling it the Equation Analysis Test. In its annual 1981 issue of "What's hot and what's not," [[Us Magazine|''Us'' magazine]] named the Equation Analysis Test in the "what's hot" category – the only nonperson so recognized. Shortz reports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some anonymous person had retyped the puzzle from ''Games'' (word for word, except for my byline),
photocopied it, and passed it along. This page was then rephotocopied ad infinitum, like a chain letter,
and circulated around the country. ''Games'' readers who hadn't seen the original even started sending
it back to ''Games'' as something the magazine ought to consider publishing!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortz based the puzzle on the Formula Analysis Test - Revised Form published in [[Morgan Worthy]]'s 1975 book ''AHA! A Puzzle Approach to Creative Thinking'' (Chicago: Nelson Hall). Worthy's equations were in a different format, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
!style="width:250px;text-align:left"|&lt;u&gt;Puzzle&lt;/u&gt;
!style="text-align:left"|&lt;u&gt;Solution&lt;/u&gt;
|-
|M. + M. + N.H. + V. + C. + R.I = N.E.
|[[Maine]] + [[Massachusetts]] + [[New Hampshire]] + [[Vermont]] + [[Connecticut]] + [[Rhode Island]] = [[New England]]
|-
|"1B. in the H. = 2 in the B."
|"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" (a [[proverb]])
|-
|N. + V. + P. + A. + A. + C. + P. + I. = P. of S.
|[[noun]] + [[verb]] + [[pronoun]] + [[adjective]] + [[adverb]] + [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] + [[preposition]]  + [[interjection]] = [[Parts of Speech]]
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Worthy gives the source of his inspiration and speculates about the perennial popularity
of this puzzle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I got the idea for linguistic equations from graffiti someone had
written in the form of an obscene formula on a restroom wall at the
University of Florida. When the answer suddenly came to me, I realized
the format was a good one for eliciting the "aha effect". After that I
used such items as exercise material when teaching workshops on
creative thinking.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My guess is that one reason a person enjoys linguistic equations is
that the answer hits him or her all at once rather than being solved in
an incremental fashion. It is similar to what happens when we suddenly
see an embedded figure pop into focus; the satisfaction is visceral
rather than just intellectual. My experience was that people often had
the answer to an item come to them when they were not consciously
thinking about the puzzles, but relaxed, such as in the shower or about
to fall asleep.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another factor is that with well-written items, success does not hinge
on obscure information. Ideally, a person should never have to feel, "I
could never have gotten that one no matter how long I worked on it."
There is something ego enhancing about knowing you have the answer
inside and just need to find it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">In '''''Dukes v Marthinusen''''', the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] held it to be consistent with principles of the law of [[South African law of delict|delictual liability]] that a duty cast upon a [[defendant]] might be such that it is discharged only if reasonable precautions to avoid harm are actually taken, and that the defendant who appoints another to take those steps, and fails to do, will be liable for the failure.&lt;ref&gt;18.&lt;/ref&gt; In casu, the defendant had employed an [[independent contractor]] to demolish certain buildings. In a claim for [[damages]] arising from the [[negligence|negligent]] performance of the work, Stratford ACJ said the following after considering various cases in South Africa and in England:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The English law on the subject as I have stated it to be is in complete accord with our own, both systems rest the rule as to the liability of an employer for any damage caused by work he authorises another to do upon the law of negligence. It follows from the law as I have stated it to be that the first and crucial question in this case is to ascertain on the facts of the case whether there was a duty on the employer who authorised the demolition of these buildings to take precautions to protect the public using the highway from possible injury. If there was such duty it could not be delegated and the employment of an independent contractor is an irrelevant consideration.&lt;ref&gt;23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''''Eastern Morning News''''' was a [[newspaper]] based in [[Kingston upon Hull]], UK Founded by [[William Saunders (Liberal politician)|William Saunders]] in 1864, it ceased publication in November 1929.

==History==
The ''Eastern Morning News'' was founded in 1864 by Liberal politician [[William Saunders (Liberal politician)|William Saunders]], it was Hull's first daily paper.&lt;ref name="pub2"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1976|loc = pp.138–9; also Table 2. The English Provincial Daily Press 1856–1870, p.275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was a substantial and serious publication, independent but with Liberal leanings,&lt;ref name="pub2"/&gt; covering  both local and world news, with coverage of finance and shipping, and with editorial comment, intended for an informed or professional audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.hullhistorycentre.org.uk/discover/hull_history_centre/our_collections/sourceguides/newspapers1.aspx| title = History of Hull Newspapers| publisher  = [[Hull History Centre]]| accessdate  =30 August 2012| at = Part 1: The early years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the [[BBC]]'s radio news service as well as the [[Great Depression|1930s recession]] contributed to the end of publication of the paper and its Saturday sister publication the ''Hull News'' on 8 November 1929; the publishing company re-focused on the publication of an enlarged edition of the ''Hull Evening News'', which ceased publication in 1930, taken over by a rival; the more financially secure and Conservative biased ''Daily Mail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.hullhistorycentre.org.uk/discover/hull_history_centre/our_collections/source_guides/hull_newspapers_part_2.aspx| title = History of Hull Newspapers| publisher  = [[Hull History Centre]]| accessdate  =30 August 2012| at = Part 1: The Twentieth Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, while she was working as a temporary legal secretary in [[Los Angeles]], this interest overlapped into the early [[multiplayer]] games, such as ''[[British Legends]]'' on [[CompuServe]] and [[Simutronics]]' ''[[GemStone II]]'' on [[GEnie]].&lt;ref name=RiverfrontTimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/issues/2002-06-19/news_full.html |title=When Dragons Escape |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |author=Batz, Jeannette |date=June 19, 2002 |publisher=''[[Riverfront Times]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814222239/http://www.riverfronttimes.com/issues/2002-06-19/news_full.html |archivedate=August 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryptography ===
[[File:Elonka Dunin.jpg|right|in St. Louis, 2006|180px|thumb]]
Dunin has written books and articles about [[cryptography]], and been interviewed on radio and television about related subjects such as ''[[Kryptos]]'', the [[Smithy Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Countdown with Keith Olbermann for April 28|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12578325/|date=May 1, 2006|accessdate=August 13, 2011|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ricky McCormick's encrypted notes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kplr11.com/news/ktvi-cracking-code-could-help-solve-st-charles-murder-case-20110330,0,7253504.story|title=FBI seeks help cracking cold case code|author=Jaco, Charles|authorlink=Charles Jaco|publisher=[[KPLR-TV|KPLR]]|date=March 30, 2011|accessdate=August 13, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821020901/http://www.kplr11.com/news/ktvi-cracking-code-could-help-solve-st-charles-murder-case-20110330,0,7253504.story|archivedate=August 21, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with GIGnews.com, Dunin said that in the year 2000 she cracked the [[PhreakNIC]] v3.0 Code, an amateur cryptographic puzzle created by a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker group]], and that this launched her public interest in high-profile ciphers.&lt;ref name="GIGnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gignews.com/goddess/dunin.htm |title=A Chat with Elonka Dunin |work=GIGnews.com |first=Melanie |last=Cambron|date=May 2002 |accessdate=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pn6"&gt;[http://phreaknic.info/pn6/schedule.html PhreakNIC 6 schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201114053/http://www.phreaknic.info/pn6/schedule.html |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the location of ''Kryptos'' on [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] grounds, physical access to the sculpture is restricted. According to ''[[Wired News]]'', in 2002, Dunin gave a presentation to CIA analysts about [[steganography]] and [[Al-Qaeda]], and "[i]n 2002, Dunin was one of the lucky few who saw [Kryptos] in person", and "she also made [[rubbing]]s of the text".&lt;ref name="wired05"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/01/66334 |title=Solving the Enigma of Kryptos|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]] |first=Kim |last=Zetter |date=January 21, 2005 |accessdate=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on her visit, she launched the beginnings of what became a comprehensive website about the sculpture,&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired06&gt;{{cite news |title=Typo Confounds Kryptos Sleuths |author=Zetter, Kim |date=April 20, 2006 |publisher=[[Wired News]].

In 2003, Dunin organized a team which solved the ciphers on ''Kryptos'''s sister sculpture, the ''[[Cyrillic Projector]]''.&lt;ref name=stccbr/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science Now"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2003/1007/3|title=Cryptic Sculpture Cracked |journal=[[Science Now]]|first=Charles |last=Seife |date=October 7, 2003|archiveurl=http://elonka.com/kryptos/mirrors/ScienceMagazine.html|archivedate=2004-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol302/issue5643/r-samples.dtl Cyrillic Riddle Solved] ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', vol 302, 10 October 2003, page 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Post-Dispatch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/News/92251953766AB8FE86256DBA00139A45?OpenDocument |title=Woman sets sights on code on CIA sculpture |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |first=Eli |last=Kintisch|date=2003-10-08|archiveurl=http://www.elonka.com/mirrors/STL/sights.html |archivedate=2004-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Kryptos'' sculptor [[Jim Sanborn]] chose to release information about an error on the sculpture in 2006, he contacted Dunin to make the announcement.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired06/&gt; In July 2007, Dunin appeared on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program ''[[NOVA scienceNOW]]'', as an expert on ''Kryptos'', and in 2009, contributed two articles about the sculpture for the book ''Secrets of The Lost Symbol: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind The Da Vinci Code Sequel'',&lt;ref name=secrets&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Lost-Symbol-Unauthorized-Mysteries/dp/0061964956#reader_0061964956|accessdate=2009-12-30|title=Secrets of the Lost Symbol: The Unauthorized Guide to the Mysteries Behind The Da Vinci Code Sequel|editors=Daniel Burstein &amp; Arne de Keijzer (editors)|author=Dunin, Elonka|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-06-196495-4|chapter=Kryptos: The Unsolved Enigma|pages=319–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; a companion book to author [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Lost Symbol]]''. Dunin had assisted Brown with the research for the novel, and Brown named a character in the novel after her. The character "Nola Kaye" is an anagrammed form of "Elonka".&lt;ref name=secrets/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated Guide to the Lost Symbol|page=161|editor=John Weber (ed.)|author=Taylor, Greg|isbn=978-1-4165-2366-6|year=2009|chapter=Decoding ''Kryptos''|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to the Lost Symbol|page=35|author=Haag, Michael|isbn=978-1-84836-009-9|year=2009|publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Dunin compiled a book of several hundred exercises in [[classical cryptography]], which was published in the United States as ''The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms'', and in the UK as ''The Mammoth Book of Secret Code Puzzles''. The book also includes a few details about several unsolved codes, such as ''Kryptos''.&lt;ref name=wired06/&gt;

In 2013, in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request by Dunin, the [[NSA]] released documents which show the NSA became involved in attempts to solve the ''Kryptos'' puzzle in 1992, following a challenge by [[Bill Studeman]], Deputy Director of the CIA. The documents show that by June 1993, a small group of NSA cryptanalysts had succeeded in solving the first three parts of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=wired.com|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/nsa-cracked-kryptos-before-cia|title=Documents Reveal How the NSA Cracked the Kryptos Sculpture Years Before the CIA|first=Kim|last=Zetter|date=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=slate.com|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/11/nsa_cracked_kryptos_statue_before_the_cia.html|title=NSA Cracked Kryptos Before the CIA.

'''''Encyklopedie branné moci Republiky československé 1920 - 1938''''' (- in [[Czech language|Czech]], ''Encyclopedia of Czechoslovak Military 1920 - 1938'') is a printed [[Czech language]] encyclopedia covering the military of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]]. It was published in 2006 by publisher Libri, {{ISBN|80-7277-256-2}}.

The book was written by Jiří Fidler and Václav Sluka, both military historians specialized on [[World War II|prewar]] era. The book, with 768 pages and over 3,000 entries, covers:
* weapons,
* personalities (including weapon designers, military related details of Czechoslovak politicians and biographies of French generals serving in Czechoslovakia),
* units and their locations,
* armament industry and other infrastructure.

The encyclopedia uses traditional form and its entries are sorted alphabetically. Photographs, plans and layouts accompany the text entries. The period covered starts with 1920 unification of local military forces (former Austro-Hungarian units, volunteers and paramilitaries as [[Sokol]]) and the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] built abroad and ends with the general mobilization in 1938 (which was followed by the [[Munich Agreement]]). Some biographies also include later events. &lt;ref&gt;[http://armada.vojenstvi.cz/recenze_8.htm Book review] (in Czech).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Envelope Collective''' is an ongoing collaborative art project that uses mail as a medium. The Envelope Collective was founded by [http://heyitsgarrett.com%20 Garrett Miller] and Adam Morse on November 3, 2005. Anyone can send anything to the Envelope Collective; people from all over the world have sent in everything from boxes of Kraft Mac and Cheese to handmade paper [[envelope]]s.

On April 11, 2006 The Envelope Collective reached 300 submissions. The Envelope Collective is not accepting submissions any longer. Garrett and Adam have graduated from Oberlin College and moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

The Envelope Collective is one of the largest online collectives of [[Mail art]] with over 1000 submissions from hundreds of artists.

==Summary==

The prologue is a letter from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, addressed "To my lawyer, Saxonberg", accompanied by a drawing of her writing at her office desk. It serves as the cover letter for the 162-page narrative, and provides background for changes to her last will and testament.

&lt;!-- Mrs F narrates in past tense but we don't summarize thus --&gt;
Twelve-year-old Claudia Kincaid decides to run away from her home in [[suburban]] Connecticut, because she thinks her parents do not appreciate her and she doesn't like it. She takes refuge in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (the Met) in [[New York City]], with her brother Jamie. She chooses Jamie as her companion partly because he has saved all his money. With the help of an unused adult train fare card that she found in a wastebasket, Claudia finds a way to get to the museum for free using the commuter train and a very long walk.

Early chapters depict Claudia and Jamie settling in at the Met: hiding in the bathroom at closing time, as security staff check to see that all the patrons have departed; blending in with school groups on tour; bathing in the fountain, and using "wishing coins" for money; and sleeping in [[Irwin Untermyer]]'s antique bed.

A new exhibit draws sensational crowds and fascinates the children: the marble statue of an angel, the sculptor unknown but suspected to be [[Michelangelo]]. It was purchased at auction, for only a few hundred dollars, from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, a collector who recently closed her showcase Manhattan residence. The children research it on site and at the [[Donnell Library Center|Donnell Library]], and give their conclusion to the museum staff anonymously.

After learning they have been naive, the children spend the last of their money on travel to Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler's home in Connecticut. She recognizes them as runaways but sets them briefly to the task of researching the angel from files in her long bank of cabinets. Despite the idiosyncratic organization of her files, they do discover the angel's secret&amp;mdash;Mrs. Frankweiler has purposefully "given away" a virtually priceless Michelangelo to the Met. In exchange for a full account of their adventure, she will leave the crucial file to them in her will, and send them home in her [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]]. 
Claudia learns her deep motive for persisting in the crazy search: she wanted a secret of her own to treasure and keep. Mrs. Frankweiler may get "grandchildren" who delight her. Her lawyer gets a luncheon date at the Met, to revise her will.

== Characters ==
The Kincaids live in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. Mrs. Frankweiler lives on a "country estate" in [[Farmington, Connecticut]], closer to [[Hartford]].

* Claudia Kincaid, 11, is the oldest of four children and the only girl, so she both sets the table and empties the dishwasher. She is a straight-A [[sixth grade]] student, a critic of [[English grammar]], and a good planner, except about money in which she spends largely on sweets. She feels unappreciated at home, plans to run away with her brother Jamie, and recruits him. They run to the Metropolitan Museum and there discover a mystery of the art world, which fascinates her and overwhelms the adventure.
* Jamie Kincaid, 9, is the third child and the middle boy, in fourth grade, quiet and frugal. He complements his sister perfectly: "adventurous (about everything but money) and rich"&lt;ref&gt;''[[#first|Mixed-Up Files]]'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; —from their viewpoint, an American suburb in the mid‑1960s. He cheats at the card game [[War (card game)|War]], playing with his best friend for money on the school bus daily. From that and his weekly allowance he has saved $24.43, and he has a transistor radio, his one purchase.
* Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, 82, is smart, insightful, eccentric, and rich. She is the [[narrator]], telling the story of Claudia and Jamie Kincaid to her [[lawyer|attorney]]. She is a commentator, providing insight into the children's actions. She is the plot facilitator, for her election to allow sale of an extraordinary sculpture at auction, for only $225, set the book's mystery in motion.
*Saxonberg is Mrs. Frankweiler's lawyer, and is revealed to be Claudia and Jamie's grandfather.

==Origins==
When Konigsburg submitted ''Mixed&amp;#8209;Up Files'' to Jean Karl at Atheneum in 1966, she was an unpublished mother of three children living in the suburbs of New York City.&lt;ref name=afterword&gt;
[[#35th|''Mixed-Up Files'', 35th anniversary ed.]], Afterword. Unnumbered [pp. 163–74].&lt;/ref&gt;

One inspiration for the novel was a page-one story in the ''New York Times'' on October 26, 1965.{{efn|Konigsburg later cited October 25, which was Monday. The page one story was published Tuesday, concerning a Friday auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Esterow|first=Milton|title=A $225 Sculpture May Be a Master's Worth $500,000|work=The New York Times|date=October 26, 1965|pages=1, 42|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|last=Glueck|first=Grace|title=Museum Shows $225 'Bargain': Metropolitan to Test Bust To Determine Its Sculptor|work=The New York Times|date=October 29, 1965|page=50|postscript=none}};
{{cite news|last=Knox|first=Sanka|title=Museum's $225 Bust Credited to Leonardo|work=The New York Times|date=April 10, 1969|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Konigsburg recalled years later that the Metropolitan Museum had purchased for only $225 a [[plaster#In art|plaster]] and [[stucco]] statue from the time of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. "They knew they had an enormous bargain."&lt;ref name=afterword/&gt;&lt;ref name=autobiography/&gt;

Another inspiration was complaints by Konigsburg's children in [[Yellowstone National Park]], about a picnic with many amenities of home. She inferred that if they ever ran away "[t]hey would certainly never consider any place less elegant than the Metropolitan Museum of Art".&lt;ref name=autobiography&gt;[http://cms2.westport.k12.ct.us/cmslmc/resources/authorstudy/authors/konigauto.htm "Konigsburg, E.

The author's two younger children Laurie and Ross (who turned eleven and nine in 1967) posed for the illustrations of Claudia and Jamie. Anita Brigham, a neighbor in their [[Port Chester, New York]], apartment house posed as Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Frankweiler.&lt;ref name=transcript&gt;[http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/collateral.jsp?id=1488_type=Contributor_typeId=3412 "E.

The character of Mrs.&amp;nbsp;Frankweiler was based on [[Headmistress]] Olga Pratt at Bartram's School for Girls in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], where Konigsburg once taught [[chemistry]]. "Miss Pratt was not wealthy, but she was a matter-of-fact person. Kind, but firm."&lt;ref name=transcript/&gt;

On February 21, 2014, family and friends of E.L. Konigsburg gathered in a private space at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to pay tribute to the author, who died on April 19, 2013 at age 83. One of the speakers was Paul Konigsburg, the author's son. He told a story.&lt;ref name=event&gt;Burnett, Matia (February 25, 2014).

Retrieved 2014-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During the mid-1960s, [Konigsburg] would drop off [her young son] Paul and his siblings, Laurie and Ross, at the museum, while [Konigsburg] attended her own art classes. By the time the children made their routine visits to the knights in armor, the mummy, and the Impressionists (at Laurie's request), Konigsburg's class would be finished and she would return to explore the museum with them.

On one such occasion, Paul recalled, his mother spotted a single piece of popcorn on the floor next to an ornate piece of royal furniture, which was completely blocked off from public access. He remembers his mother wondering aloud, where did that popcorn come from? And it was that moment, "burned into shrapnel memory", that he believes formed the kernel of the story that would become ''From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler''. She was "a very special lady", he said, whose passion for art drew her to this "very special place".&lt;ref name=event/&gt;}}

The '''''Grete Herball''''' (The Great Herbal) is an [[Early Modern]] [[encyclopedia]] and the first illustrated [[herbal]] produced in English. It is preceded by Richard Banckes's unillustrated ''Herball'' ([[1525 in science|1525]]), which was the first printed English herbal ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arber|first1=Agnes|title=Herbals: Their Origin and Evolution|date=1970|publisher=Halfner Publishing|location=Darien|page=41|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Grete Herball'' is a single volume compendium which details the medicinal properties (or [[virtues]]) of plants and some non-botanical items according to the system of [[humoralism]]. Confirmed editions were printed between 1526 and 1561, with many still in existence today. Its full title is ''"The grete herball : whiche geueth parfyt knowlege and under standyng of all maner of herbes &amp; there gracyous vertues whiche god hath ordeyned for our prosperous welfare and helth : for they hele &amp; cure all maner of dyseases and sekenesses that fall or mysfortune to all maner of creatoures of god created : practysed by many expert and wyse maysters, as Aucienna &amp; other &amp;c."''

===Text===
Like most medieval and early modern herbals, the ''Grete Herball'' is made up of information taken from earlier works. This literary tradition can be traced back to the second millennium b.c.e., but the number of herbals grew most in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Minta|title=Medieval Herbals: The Illustrative Traditions|date=2000|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[De Materia Medica]] is considered one of the most important encyclopedias of plant knowledge from the time, but herbals became numerous and wholesale lifting of information common and expected. Authors and printers borrowed freely, often without the addition of any original content. Instead, the ''Grete Herball'' is considered the only known translation from French of ''Le Grant Herbier'' (1498).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Frank J.|title=An Illustrated History of the Herbals|date=1912|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like contemporary herbals, ''Le Grant Herbier'' exhibits heavy borrowing. Over half of its chapters are lifted from ''Circa instans'', a Salernitan work created between approximately 1130 and 1150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Frank J.|title=An Illustrated History of the Herbals|date=1912|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later botanists, such as [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]] and [[Nicholas Culpeper]], would begin to break this tradition and put their own observations, research, and theories into their herbals alongside older knowledge. Turner was disdainful of previous efforts, it is believed he is referring to the ''Grete Herball'' when he states "...as yet there was no English Herbal but one, all full of unlearned cacographees (bad spelling) and falsely naming of herbs..." in the preface to his own ''Herbal'' (1568).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=William|title=The first and seconde partes of the herbal of William Turner Doctor in Phisick...|date=1568|publisher=Arnold Birchman|location=Collen|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pulteney|first1=Richard|title=Historical and biographical sketches of the progress of botany in England, from its origin to the introduction of the Linnæan system|date=1790|publisher=printed for T.

===Images===
[[File:The Grete Herball, woodcut image of a musk deer, 1526.jpg|thumb|right|Woodcut image, Grete Herball, 1526]]
Similarly, the ''Grete Herball'''s numerous woodcuts are taken from ''Le Grant Herbier'', but like the text these images are not original to the French ''Herbier''. They are in fact copies of a series of woodcuts which first appeared in the German ''Herbarius zu Teutsch'' (also known as ''Der Gart'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arber|first1=Agnes|title=Herbals: Their Origin and Evolution|date=1970|publisher=Halfner Publishing|location=Darien|page=45|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Frank J.|title=An Illustrated History of the Herbals|date=1912|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Grete Herball'' the same woodcut image is often reused for multiple entries. By most accounts, these images became much degraded between their original use in ''Herbarius'' and their subsequent recycling in the ''Grete Herball''. Woodcuts were expensive to acquire, and like other printers of his time [[Peter Treveris]] would reuse them in later books. One such book is "''The vertuose boke of Distillacyon of the waters of all maner of Herbes'' (1527), translated by Laurence Andrew from the ''Liber de arte distillandi'' by Hieronymus Braunschweig, [which] is illustrated with cuts from the same wood-blocks as the ''Grete Herball''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohde|first1=Eleanor Sinclaire|title=The Old English Herbals|date=1922|publisher=Longman, Greens &amp; Co.|location=London|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print History==

===Format===
The book is printed in a double column format with [[black letter]] typeface and contains a variety of [[woodcuts]] depicting plants, animals, people, and garden scenes. Though the order varies by edition, many feature a list of chapters at the beginning and an index at the end. The ''Grete Herball'' contains extensive information on plant life as well as entries on animals, [[comestibles]], and minerals. Each entry features an image of the plant or item, its Latin name, any known alternate names, its [[humoral]] categorization, any associated folklore, a list of its medical and practical applications, and instructions for use. Editions and surviving copies vary in length. Botanist [[Richard Pulteney]]'s description of a 1526 copy states that "...if printed with numbered pages, [it] would make three hundred and fifty, exclusive of the Preface and Index."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pulteney|first1=Richard|title=Historical and biographical sketches of the progress of botany in England, from its origin to the introduction of the Linnæan system|date=1790|publisher=printed for T. Cadell|location=London|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printers===
[[File:Personal device of printer Peter Treveris from the Grete Herball July 27 1526.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Treveris's personal device of a wild man and wild woman, Grete Herball, 1526]]
[[Peter Treveris]], printer, is widely believed to be responsible for the first productions of the ''Grete Herball''. His dates of birth and death are unknown, but it is estimated that he died in the mid-1530s. Though there is some evidence suggesting Treveris first printed the ''Grete Herball'' in 1516, the earliest verifiable edition dates to July 27, 1526.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amherst|first1=Alicia|title=A History of Gardening in England|date=1896|publisher=Bernard Quaritch|location=London|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was printed at Southwark, as was the second edition in 1529. Treveris was active as a printer between approximately 1525 and 1532, during which time he printed such works as Hieronymus Braunschweig's ''Noble Handiwork of Surgery'' (1525), the ''Grete Herball'' (1526, 1529), and the ''Polychronicon'' (1527). The ''Grete Herball'''s translation from French may have been performed by his associate Lawrence Andrewe, a fellow printer and bookseller, but this is as yet unconfirmed. Some copies of the ''Herball'' contain an image of Treveris's personal device, a shield bearing his initials held up by a wild man and woman. Some copies also contain Andrewe's device, confirming their collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=N. F.|title=Treveris, Peter (fl. 1525–1532), printer|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27720|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Grete Herball proved popular enough to be reprinted several times after Treveris's death. Thome Gybson printed an updated edition "''The grete herbal newly corrected''" in 1539,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The grete herball newly corrected|url=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:20495|website=Early English Books Online|publisher=Thome Gybson|date=1539}}&lt;/ref&gt; and printer John Kyng produced the final Early Modern edition in 1561.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grete Herball|url=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:21426|website=Early English Books Online|publisher=John Kyng|location=London|date=1561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Gybson and Kyng use fewer images and different [[Book frontispiece|frontispieces]] than Treveris's editions.

===Rarity===
The first and second editions of the ''Grete Herball'' are extremely rare. Only three  "complete and perfect" copies of the 1529 edition are known to exist, though fragments of other copies have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sims|first1=Liam|title=Peter Treveris' Grete Herball of 1529|url=https://specialcollections.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=4311#_ftn2|website=Cambridge University Library Special Collections|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that do exist usually show signs of repair, such as being rebound or having replaced spines and added pages. One such copy, a 1529 edition transferred to Cambridge University in 2013, exhibits repair work done over many centuries.
[[Christie's]] auction listing of a 1526 ''Grete Herball'' claims there are only three complete copies of the first edition as well, with incomplete copies held by Yale and in the Marshall Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sale 2170, Lot 97|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/the-grete-herball-which-geveth-parfyte-knowledge-5217161-details.aspx|website=Christie's, the art people|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provenance of these books can be difficult to trace, and records of ownership often reach only to the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot 29., The Grete Herball|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/travel-atlases-maps-natural-history-l15401/lot.29.html|website=Sotheby's|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sale 2170, Lot 97|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/the-grete-herball-which-geveth-parfyte-knowledge-5217161-details.aspx|website=Christie's, the art people|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sims|first1=Liam|title=Peter Treveris' Grete Herball of 1529|url=https://specialcollections.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=4311#_ftn2|website=Cambridge University Library Special Collections|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their scarcity, copies of the ''Grete Herball'' are of interest to rare book collectors. Early editions have been valued in the thousands at auction. [[Sotheby's]] auction house valued one 1526 copy (bound together with Treveris's printing of the ''Noble Handiwork of Surgery'' (1525)) between £50,000 and £70,000 GBP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot 29., The Grete Herball|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/travel-atlases-maps-natural-history-l15401/lot.29.html|website=Sotheby's|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1526 copy sold by [[Christie's]] fetched $5,625 USD on June 24, 2009, and was valued between $4000 – $6000 USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sale 2170, Lot 97|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/the-grete-herball-which-geveth-parfyte-knowledge-5217161-details.aspx|website=Christie's, the art people|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Mandrake roots with human forms, from the Grete Herball 1526.jpg|thumb|left|Human formed mandrake roots, Grete Herball, 1526]]
As an herbal text, the book's content is primarily on the medicinal uses and properties of the materials described. Exceptions to this rule are suggestions for cosmetic use or folklore associated with the item. One well-known entry concerns the [[Mandrake]], an herb with the mythical human form of a  man and a woman. Accompanying woodcuts demonstrate this belief, but the ''Grete Herball'''s entry text dismisses the myth outright: "Some say that the male hath figure or shape of a man. And the female of a woman, but that is false. For nature never gave forme or shape of mankynde to an herbe. But it is of trough (truth) that some hath shaped such figures by craft." Entries can also hold warnings for those seeking to use the items, such as the entry for Spodium (elephant ivory), which describes dog bones sometimes being passed off as ipodium (elephant bones) by unscrupulous physicians. Each plant and non-botanical is also described as being either hot or cold, dry or wet, and the "degree" of each. This categorization allowed doctors to prescribe a corresponding medicine for diseases, which were defined by the same system in a separate section of the book.

Copies of this herbal are not consistent in their current form, many having been rebound or bound with other books. The following arrangement is taken from the 1526 edition of the Grete Herball at Special Collections, The Claremont Colleges Library, Claremont, California.

=== Title Page and Frontispiece ===
The title page is dominated by the printed full title of the Grete Herball, with a large frontispiece depicting a man and woman working in a garden. In each corner a mandrake root of each gender is depicted. The title is printed in both red and black ink.

=== Anatomical Chart ===
This full-page image is a frontal view of a human skeleton, with labels describing the major bones of the body.mohanty bira kishore

=== Main Text ===
There are approximately 400 entries for plants and non-botanical items. Of these, 150 plants are English natives. Some plant entries are [[mugwort]], [[cypress]], [[mandrake root]], [[grapes]], [[chamomile]], [[Muscat (grape)|muscat]], and marrubium ([[Marrubium|horehound]]). Animals recommended for their medicinal value include [[hare]], [[fox]] (fox grease is recommended for muscle cramps), [[goat]], [[ox]], [[elephant ivory]], and [[beaver]]. Some of the minerals and liquids listed are [[Lime (material)|lyme]], [[glass]], [[magnets]], [[pearls]], [[amber]], [[sulpher]], water, and vinegar. Foods that double as remedies are also present, with cheese prescribed for purgation, butter, [[honey]], and zipules (a type of heavy fritter) recommended for toothaches. Some of the entries feature truly unusual remedies, such as a lengthy section on the use of [[mummy]] (spelled as mommie), the powdered version of which is described as a remedy for stopping nosebleeds. Besides medical uses, these entries also provide information on cosmetic applications of items, such as the bones of [[sepia (genus)|sepia]] (cuttlefish) for whitening the teeth and complexion.

=== Additional Chapters ===
An addendum to the previous section, with the same style and format.

=== Diagnosis Guide ===
This section contains information on physician's classifications of the humors and types of illness. This is according to the [[Galen]]ic system of humors, with the [[four temperaments]] described according to the state of their "bryne" or humors. This is followed by instructions for diagnosis of illnesses, again by referencing the state of a person's "bryne".

=== Catalogue of Aliments ===
A catalogue of illnesses and their symptoms. Some examples are [[alopecia]], [[asthma]], worms, cramps, flesh wounds, [[flux]]es, and [[gout]].

=== Index ===
The final index is an alphabetically organized list of various maladies, with reference to the entry number and first letter of appropriate medicines for each. The headings are often specific, such as "For wormes in the bely of chyldren" or "For broken synews."

==Scholarship==

Usually, the ''Grete Herball'' is not the sole focus of scholarly work itself, but is mentioned in larger examinations of the history of herbals and botany. One exception is ''The English Plant Names in The Grete Herball (1526) A contribution to the Historical Study of English Plant-Name Usage'' by Swedish author Mats Rydén.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryden|first1=Mats|title=The English Plant Names in The Grete Herball (1526) A contribution to the Historical Study of English Plant-Name Usage|date=1984|publisher=Almqvist &amp; Wiksell|location=Stockholm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a philological study focused on the herbal's English plant names, "...their frequency of use, provenance, typology, and synonymy (i.e. identity)...and changes in groups of names." It has been praised as filling a "shocking gap in English-language scholarship", but its potential use as a historical work has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Getz|first1=Faye Marie|title=Book Reviews|journal=Medical History|date=January 1988|volume=32|issue=01|pages=101–102|doi=10.1017/S0025727300047761|PMC=1139833|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8620984&amp;previous=true&amp;jid=MDH&amp;volumeId=32&amp;issueId=01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermine "Erminia" Speier''' (28 May 1898 in [[Frankfurt am Main]] – 12 January 1989 in [[Montreux]]) was a German [[classical archaeology|archaeologist]]. One of the few female archaeologists of her time, she was the first female employee of the [[Vatican Museums]] and one of the first professional women to be employed by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. She was a pioneering contributor to the collections of archaeological photographs and is often credited as being the first archaeological photo-archivist.

==Biography==
Hermine Speier was born on 28 May, 1898, in Frankfurt am Main into a wealthy Jewish family.{{sfn|Zanker|2014|p=123}} She attended Frankfurt's [[Bettinaschule|Viktoriaschule]], passing her matriculation examination in [[Wiesbaden]] after attending a private school.{{sfn|Fries|Gutsmiedl-Schümann|2013|p=151}} In the winter semester of 1918/19 she enrolled at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], studying history, German literature and philosophy. In the summer semester of 1919 she transferred to the [[University of Giessen]], and in the winter semester 1919/20 continued at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. In Giessen, she also attended a teachers' training course and was introduced to classical archaeology at the college run by [[Gerhart Rodenwaldt]]. In Heidelberg she changed her major to archaeology.&lt;ref name="Brown University bio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daltrop|first1=Georg|title=Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology-Hermine Speier|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/results.php?d=1&amp;first=Hermine&amp;last=Speier|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=12 December 2015|location=Providence, Rhode Island|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied under teachers such as [[Eberhard Gothein]], [[Friedrich Gundolf]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Hermann Oncken]],{{sfn|Zanker|2014|p=123}} [[Hans Driesch]] and [[Karl Hampe|Karl Ludwig Hampe]]. After 1920, when [[Ludwig Curtius]] was appointed to the university, he became her most important teacher and patron, helping her to focus on archaeology. Besides Curtius, teachers such as [[Franz Boll (philologist)|Franz Boll]], [[Alfred von Domaszewski]], [[Karl Meister]] and especially [[Bernhard Schweitzer]] gave her a broad-based knowledge of antiquity.&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daltrop|first1=Georg|title=Hermine Speier (1898-1989)|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:e1og_4cldoYJ:www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Speier_Hermine.pdf|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=12 December 2015|location=Providence, Rhode Island|language=German|date=2004|quote=Note: document is not a pdf and must be opened with Microsoft Word.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Speier graduated with a doctorate in archaeology and a double minor in ancient history and classical philology in 1925 under Curtius&lt;ref name="Brown University bio" /&gt; with a dissertation titled ''Die Gruppen angelehnter Figuren im V. und IV. Jahrhundert''. The work was published seven years later in Rome under the title ''Two figure groups in the fifth and fourth century BC''. The work contrasts differences in images between the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] periods of Greek art. Working in the tradition of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]'s methodology, she used scientific analysis to show that art reflected the historical development of culture and government. Curtius was so impressed with her work, that he stated: "If it were possible, I would give her the best mark for this excellent performance, but it is reserved for those of the male nature".&lt;ref&gt;Ich würde ihr das beste Prädikat geben, wenn nicht dieses ausgezeichneten Leistungen, die eben doch nur männlichen Naturen gelingen, vorbehalten bleiben müßte"&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only woman to achieve a doctorate under Curtius.&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; After graduating she began working as an assistant to Bernhard Schweitzer in [[Königsberg]] until 1928, when Curtius recruited her to help with the photographic archive at the [[German Archaeological Institute]] ({{lang-de|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut}}) (DAI) in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="Brown University bio" /&gt; 

Curtius was at that time the Director of the Institute and was still in the process of constructing the photographic archive.&lt;ref name="Brown University bio" /&gt; Speier was entrusted with organizing the photographic archive ("Fotothek"), with her assistant [[Adolf Greifenhagen]].{{sfn|Bittel|Deutsches Archäologisches Institut|1979|p=4}} The initial collection was based on a gift of photographs by [[Walther Amelung]]. Her work, which systematically ordered the photos, has earned her the distinction as the first archaeological photo-archivist and earned her wide professional recognition at the time from other libraries.&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; When [[Hitler]] came to power, he removed all Jews from civil service positions with the passage of the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], and precipitously she was offered the chance to build a photographic archive at the Vatican by the Director-General of the [[Vatican Museums]], Bartolomeo Nogara. She left the DAI in 1934, joining the staff at the Vatican and becoming the first woman employed by the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref name="Apostolico &amp; Nardi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apostolico|first1=Palazzo|last2=Nardi|first2=Giuseppe|title=Hermine Speier, eine jüdische Archäologin, die als erste Frau für einen Papst im Vatikan arbeitete|url=http://www.katholisches.info/2011/04/19/hermine-speier-eine-judische-archaologin-die-als-erste-frau-fur-einen-papst-im-vatikan-arbeitete/|accessdate=12 December 2015|publisher=Katholisches Magazin für Kirche und Kultur|date=19 April 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius XI]] signed her contract,&lt;ref name="Apostolico &amp; Nardi" /&gt; though initially it was for no fixed term and at a daily rate,&lt;ref name=Vian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vian|first1=Paolo|title=In 1934 the Pope Hired a German Jew|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/germjew34.htm|publisher=Eternal Word Television Network|accessdate=12 December 2015|location=Irondale, Alabama|date=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as both a statement against [[Nazi]] [[antisemitism]] and the taboo of employing women.&lt;ref name="Apostolico &amp; Nardi" /&gt; The timing of her hiring coincided with the first administration of the Museum's collections by a scientist. Prior to Nogaras, the collections were jointly managed by Guido Galli, who was a sculptor and the painter [[Biagio Biagetti]].&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt;

===Vatican archivist===
The first task was to divide the 20,000 photographic negatives into three separate collections named Classical Archaeology, Medieval and Modern Times, and Ethnographic Missions. Then she and her colleagues, archaeologist Filippo Magi and the art historian [[Deoclecio Redig de Campos]], began to classify the images, and deal with the constant flow of incoming new photographs.&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt;  In 1935, the Marchese Benedetto Guglielmo donated a private [[Etruscan art]] collection to Pope Pius XI. Speier was assigned to organize the collection. Of particular importance, she established two halls with 17 original Greek sculptures from the collection&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; and worked on the Roman refurbishment of the Greek vase collection and the Antiquarium.{{sfn|Fries|Gutsmiedl-Schümann|2013|pp=154-156}} During the mid-1930s, Speier spent considerable time in Germany traveling annually to visit her family. In 1937, her letters to her lover, Italian General, airship pioneer and Arctic explorer [[Umberto Nobile]], indicated that she was in [[Frankfurt]] for an extended period, and then in 1938, she spent time in [[Basel]] and [[Geneva]] before returning to Frankfurt.&lt;ref name="Online Archive of California"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kemp|first1=Zoe|title=Finding aid for the Hermine Speier papers 6078|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8r215ss/entire_text/|publisher=Online Archive of California|accessdate=13 December 2015|location=USC Libraries Special Collections, Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's first meeting with [[Mussolini]] took place in Rome in May 1938,{{sfn|Fattorini|2011|pp=10-11}}&lt;ref name="Timeline Pope Pius XI"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eisner|first1=Peter|title=Pope Pius XI's Last Crusade|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-eisner/popes-last-crusade_b_3071556.html|accessdate=13 December 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Speier was not back in Rome until July. Then in September, she was in the Tuscan town of [[Chianciano Terme]].&lt;ref name="Online Archive of California" /&gt; Pope Pius XI died on 10 February, 1939{{sfn|Fattorini|2011|p=14}} and Speier converted to Catholicism later that year with [[Pope Pius XII]] immediately renewing her employment.&lt;ref name="Apostolico &amp; Nardi" /&gt; Although she was intensely occupied with her work at the Vatican, she often considered emigrating to the United States, where her mother and sister lived, or to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.br.de/manuskripte-katholosche-welt-440.pdf |title='Monsignora': Hermine Speier: Eine deutsche Jüdin im Vatikan |author=Dechert, Antje |publisher=BR Bayern |date=28 June 2015 |accessdate=13 December 2015 |language=German }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this early period of his papacy, Pius XII granted 3,000 visas to Jews, if they had been baptized, to emigrate to Brazil,{{sfn|Rozett|Spector|2013|p=169}} though the only evidence found linking Speier and Pius XII at this time was, in her correspondence, his congratulatory telegram on her conversion. Throughout 1939 and 1940, Nobile was in the United States and Speier remained in Rome until the summer of 1940, when she took a retreat to Chianciano. After 1940, correspondence between the two was sparse as they feared censors and writing had become increasingly impractical.&lt;ref name="Online Archive of California" /&gt; 

Nobile returned to Rome in May 1942{{sfn|Ermolaev|Dibner|2009|p=398}} and her family severed communication with Speier after learning of her Catholic baptism, effectively ending her reasons for emigration.&lt;ref name="Apostolico &amp; Nardi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zenit /&gt; During the German occupation of Rome 1943/1944 [[Pope Pius XII]] made arrangements for [[Giulio Belvederi]], nephew of the former Pontifical Master of Ceremonies [[Pietro Respighi]], to hide Speier in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla|Catacombs of St. Priscilla]], under the nunnery.&lt;ref name="Independent Catholic News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope Pius XI’s Jewish archeologist|url=http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=18175|publisher=Independent Catholic News|accessdate=13 December 2015|location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zenit&gt;{{cite news|title=Honoring History: Jewish Woman Built Vatican Photo Archive|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/honoring-history-jewish-woman-built-vatican-photo-archive|accessdate=13 December 2015|publisher=Zenit|date=20 April 2011|location=Rome, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiding in the catacombs saved Speier from the [[Raid of the Ghetto of Rome]] on 16 October 1943 in which more than 1,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz and all save 16 were killed.&lt;ref name="Getto murders"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laskin|first1=David|title=Echoes From the Roman Ghetto|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/travel/echoes-from-the-roman-ghetto.html?_r=0|accessdate=13 December 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=12 July 2013|location=New York City, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this part of the war, the Museum was closed, until the end of September 1944, and many artworks from war-torn areas were shipped to the Vatican for storage.{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|Schultz|1982|p=23}} When it reopened, she continued with her work creating a detailed monuments inventory of the Vatican holdings, which resulted in several important finds. In 1946,&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; in an antiquities storage facility, she found a horse head sculpted by [[Phidias]]&lt;ref name=Freschi /&gt; which was originally from one of the pediments of the [[Parthenon]].{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|Schultz|1982|p=23}} On further examination, it was established from its weathering that it was in fact the second horse of Athena's chariot on the western gable, where the dispute between Athena and Poseidon&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; over the land of [[Attica]] is depicted.{{sfn|Palagia|1998|p=40}} Speier also discovered the two so-called ancient [[Aurai]] statues that decorated the exterior of the Sala Rotonda when it was built in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; She published ''Die Skulpturen des Vaticanischen Museums'' (The Sculptures of the Vatican Museums) in 1956 about the find of the Parthenon horse's head, and earlier in 1950 had published a distinguished report concerning the excavations of [[St. Peter's Basilica]]&lt;ref name="Independent Catholic News" /&gt; in Herbig's ''Vermächtnis der Antiken Kunst'' (Legacy of Ancient Art) entitled "Die neuen Ausgrabungen unter der Peterskirche in Rom".{{sfn|De Marco|1964|p=238}}

Speier was solely responsible for the collection of antiquities in the Vatican Museums, from 1961,{{cn|date=December 2015}} and all of the photo-archives before 1966 were under her direction.&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; With her appointment, a tradition was established of including one member from Germany in the central administration.{{cn|date=December 2015}} She retired as archivist and director in 1967, being succeeded by Francesco Roncalli and [[Georg Daltrop]].&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; As a result of her immense knowledge of ancient monuments, from the mid-1950s until the early 1970s Speier was entrusted by the [[German Archaeological Institute]] with the publication of the fourth edition of [[Wolfgang Helbig]]'s guide to the public collections of classical antiquities in Rome (''Führer durch die öffentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertümer in Rom''), which had not been updated in half a century.&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt; She expanded the guide's coverage, classifying the works into various groupings. She brought in several young experts to assist her, in particular [[Helga von Heintze]], [[Klaus Parlasca]], [[Erika Simon]], [[Hans von Steuben]], [[Dietrich Willers]] and [[Paul Zanker]]. She also translated the guide from Italian into German.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Roma CST SMaria della C.JPG|thumb|Grave of Hermine Speier in the Collegio Teutonico.]]
Speier was never married despite several betrothals.{{cn|date=December 2015}}  She lived near the Vatican on the [[Janiculum]] in a comfortable apartment with a roof terrace which had been put at her disposal by her lifelong patron Erich Boehringer.{{sfn|Fries|Gutsmiedl-Schümann|2013|p=153}}&lt;ref name=Freschi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freschi|first1=Marino|title=Speier, la prima ebrea in Vaticano|url=http://www.avvenire.it/Cultura/Pagine/SPEIER-.aspx|accessdate=13 December 2015|publisher=Av Venire|date=4 July 2015|location=Milan, Italy|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held a cultural salon there, inviting guests such as [[Marie Luise Kaschnitz]], who dedicated a poem to Speier; [[:de:Engelbert Kirschbaum|:de:Engelbert Kirschbaum]], a noted archaeology professor; [[Paul Augustin Mayer]], a German [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] and Oriol Schädel, head of the Library of the [[Piazza di Monte Citorio]], among others of the German and Italian [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref name=Freschi /&gt; Speier was an active member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]] and the [[Pontifical Academy of Archaeology]]. In 1973, she was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Cross of Merit of Germany]]. She received the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] medal from the Vatican.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

Speier died on 12 January 1989 in [[Montreux]], Switzerland,{{cn|date=December 2015}} and was buried in the Campo Santo Teutonico, the Vatican's [[Teutonic Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Vian /&gt; Her grave bears a piece of a [[Taranto|Tarentum]] clay relief which she had wanted to publish about as early as 1937 in the ''Festschrift Corolla Ludwig Curtius''. She had been unable to do so as Jews were excluded from the publication. Finally in 1955 she exhibited the piece from her private collection and published ''Fragment eines tarentinischen Tonreliefs in römischem Privatbesitz'' (Fragment of a Roman Tarentum clay relief in private property). Her gravestone also bears the inscription ''Leben ist Liebe'' (Life is Love).&lt;ref name="Daltrop long bio, German" /&gt;

'''''KC Colour Pages''''' and '''''KC White Pages''''' are the classified and residential [[telephone directory|telephone directories]] provided specifically for the [[Kingston Communications]] service area. ''KC Colour Pages'' became the [[UK]]'s first classified telephone directory when it was first published in 1954 to celebrate KC's 50th anniversary as Hull's telephone company. ''The Golden Pages'', as the first ''KC Colour Pages'' was initially called, carried advertising from a wide range of customers including [[taxicab|taxi]]s, [[sail]] makers, [[driver's education|driving school]]s, [[house painter and decorator|painters and decorators]] and [[office supplies|office machinery suppliers]] amongst others.

By 1992 the ''Hull Yellow Pages'' had become so popular with both telephone subscribers and advertisers that it was necessary to split the directory into two separate books, business and residential. ''Hull Colour Pages'' continued to grow and in 1998 produced the UK's first full-colour business directory, changing the directory's name from ''Hull Yellow Pages'' to '''''Hull Colour Pages''''' in the process. After a rebrand of Kingston Communications to KC in 2010 the ''Hull Colour Pages'' was renamed ''KC Colour Pages''.

==Online directory==
In 1999 ''Hull Colour Pages'' launched its Online Directory&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hullcolourpages.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; which, whilst not the UK's first online directory, set the scene for further innovation when, in 2004, ''Hull Colour Pages'' launched the UK's first online directory advertising proofing system, enabling its advertisers to review and either accept or amend their advertisements via a web interface. In the same year, ''Hull Colour Pages'' introduced the recycling programme Re:fresh, an initiative operated in partnership with local schools encouraging recycling of old directories.

==Competition==
Contemporaneously with this in July 2004 [[Yell Group|Yell]] announced that they were directly entering the Hull classified directory marketplace for the first time, thereby creating the classic David &amp; Goliath scenario where Yell, as the national Goliath, took on Hull Colour Pages' regional David.

To counter Yell's move into the Hull and [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East Riding]] advertising marketplace, Hull Colour Pages launched the 'Proud to be a Part of Local Life' brand initiative, emphasising the central role in local life Hull Colour Pages has played since 1954.

Despite particularly high levels of advertising spend Yell were not able to gain more than a toehold in the Hull marketplace as Hull Colour Pages not only retained customers and revenue but in a positive response to the national threat posed by Yell, introduced new sales strategies that were successful in maintaining and growing the customer base and advertising revenues.

The success of this sales strategy was recognised in 2005 when the Hull Colour Pages sales team was declared 'Sales Team of the Year' at the [[Data Publishers Association]] (DPA) Awards and the Hull Colour Pages was highly commended in the Directory of the Year section.

==Sponsorship==
Hull Colour Pages was a founder sponsor of the [[Hull Comedy Festival]] when it launched in 2007.  Making the most of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]'s promotion to the [[Premier League]] Hull Colour Pages are sponsoring KCFM's Away Game commentaries during the 2008-09 season.

==Local promotions==
In the same year, Hull Colour Pages was the first UK directory to provide each home and business across Hull and the East Riding with a unique personalised copy of the directory, using inkjet numbering techniques to give each directory an individual number which allowed directory users to participate in local promotions, competitions and loyalty schemes.

==Showroom sites==
For 2008 Hull Colour Pages has also introduced showroom sites&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourlocalmenus.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; a three-page entry-level [[website]] given free to its advertisers, listing menus from local [[restaurant]]s and [[Take-out|takeaways]], brand search allowing consumers to search for brand stockists through Hull Colour Pages Online and full-colour advertising in the residential telephone directory - ''Hull White Pages''.

==Awards==
These developments combined with the continued high performance on advertising sales has resulted in Hull Colour Pages being recognised by the UK trade-body for directories, The DPA (Data Publishers Association) with short-listings in five categories for the DPA AWards in October 2008.

==Personnel==
The KC Colour Pages leadership team comprises

* Director:                     Anita Pace
* Sales Manager:                Richard Moore

'''java.net''' was a [[Java (software platform)|Java technology]] related community website. It also offered a web-based [[source code repository]] for [[Java (programming language)|Java]] projects. It was shut down in April 2017.

==History==
java.net was announced by [[Sun Microsystems]] during [[JavaOne]] 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Javapedia==
The '''Javapedia''' project was launched in June 2003 during the [[JavaOne]] developer conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2003-06/sunflash.20030611.4.xml Sun Microsystems unveils java.net, the ultimate destination for developers and focal point for open source collaboration] (press release mentioning Javapedia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbcafe.com/iBLOGthere4iM/?guid=20030612091505 The Source for Java Technology Collaboration - iBLOGthere4iM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045028/http://www.kbcafe.com/iBLOGthere4iM/?guid=20030612091505 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of java.net.

The project aims at creating an online encyclopedia covering all aspects of the [[Java platform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitepapers.zdnet.co.uk/0,1000000651,260270588p,00.htm The Javapedia Project from Sun Microsystems White Papers at ZDNet UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Javapedia project is openly inspired by Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=javanet2003/&gt;

The prominent differences between ''Wikipedia'' and ''Javapedia'' include feature restrictions (for example, editing is open to registered users only), software used ([[TWiki]]), links ([[CamelCase]] is used), and content licensing ([[Creative Commons License|Creative Commons 1.0 Attribution license]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2815">'''Kabayan''' is a popular character from [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] culture, which eventually became also accepted as an [[Indonesia]]n character. His stories were considered funny and humble, but also smart. Kabayan stories has been carried since ancient times by [[oral tradition]]. His stories mostly depict the Sundanese people lives in the developed world around it. Kabayan is somehow similar to the role of middle eastern character such as [[Abu Nuwas]] or [[Nasreddin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5454">'''Life Science Identifiers'''&lt;ref&gt;Clark T., Martin S., Liefeld T. Briefings in Bioinformatics 5.1:59-70, March 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://xml.coverpages.org/lsid.html Technology Report on OMG Life Sciences Identifiers Specification (LSID)]&lt;/ref&gt; are a way to name and locate pieces of information on the web. Essentially, an LSID is a unique identifier for some data, and the LSID protocol specifies a standard way to locate the data (as well as a standard way of describing that data). They are a little like [[Digital object identifier|DOI]]s used by many publishers. 

An LSID is represented as a [[uniform resource name]] (URN) with the following format:
* urn&amp;#x3A;lsid:&lt;Authority&gt;:&lt;Namespace&gt;:&lt;ObjectID&gt;[:&lt;Version&gt;]
The ''lsid:'' namespace, however, is not registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), and so these are not strictly URNs or URIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/GUID/LSID | title=Archive of the TDWG wiki. Contribute to tdwg/wiki-archive development by creating an account on GitHub| date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LSIDs may be resolved in URLs, e.g. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:CDC8D258-8F57-41DC-B560-247E17D3DC8C 
==Controversy over the use of LSIDs==
There has been a lot of interest in LSIDs in both the [[bioinformatics]] and the [[biodiversity]] communities, with the latter continuing to use them as a way of identifying species in global catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/2/1/7/abstract Andrew C Jones, Richard J White and Ewen R Orme, Identifying and Relating Biological Concepts in the Catalogue of Life. Journal of Biomedical Semantics 2011, 2:7]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, more recently, as understanding has increased of how [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] [[uniform resource identifier|URI]]s can perform a similar naming task,&lt;ref name="converting"&gt;[http://dbooth.org/2006/urn2http/#lsid Booth, David: "Converting New URI Schemes or URN Sub-Schemes to HTTP"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-semweb-lifesci/2006Jul/0206.html Thompson, Henry S.: "A precedent suggesting a compromise for the SWHCLS IG Best Practices", publicly archived email message]&lt;/ref&gt; the use of LSIDs as identifiers has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2006Jul/0041 Mendelsohn, Noah: "My conversation with Sean Martin about LSIDs", public email to W3C TAG mailing list 25-Jul-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; as violating the [http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#pr-reuse-uri-schemes Web Architecture] good practice of reusing existing URI schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#pr-reuse-uri-schemes W3C Architecture of the World Wide Web]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the explicit separation of data from metadata; specification of a method for discovering multiple locations for data-retrieval; and the ability to discover multiple independent sources of metadata for any identified thing were crucial parts of the LSID and its resolution specification that have not successfully been mimicked by an HTTP-only approach.

The [[World Wide Web]] provides a globally distributed communication framework that is essential for almost all scientific collaboration, including bioinformatics. However, several limits and inadequacies were thought to exist, one of which was the inability to programmatically identify locally named objects that may be widely distributed over the network.  This perceived shortcoming would have limited our ability to integrate multiple knowledgebases, each of which gives partial information of a shared domain, as is commonly seen in bioinformatics. The Life Science Identifier (LSID) and LSID Resolution System (LSRS) were designed to provide simple and elegant solutions to this problem, consistent with next-generation [[Semantic Web]] and [[semantic grid]], based on the extension of existing internet technologies.  However, it has more recently been pointed out that some of these perceived shortcomings are not intrinsic to HTTP URIs, and much (though not all) of the functionality that LSIDs provide can be obtained using properly crafted HTTP URIs.&lt;ref name="converting"/&gt;

      <comment>Correct false information. The method for how a President should resign was passed by Congress March 1, 1792. David Gergen, acting as council to President Nixon mentions this fact in his book, Eyewitness To Power: The Essence of Leadership Nixon to Clinton. The citation to the law can be found via HeinOnline.</comment>

[[Image:Letter of Resignation of Richard M. Nixon, 1974.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Nixon]]'s Resignation Letter to his [[Secretary of State]], August 9, 1974]]
A '''letter of resignation''' is written to announce the author's intent to leave a position currently held, such as an office, employment or commission.  

Such a letter will often take legal effect to terminate an appointment or employment, as notice under the relevant terms of the position; many appointments and contractual employments are terminable by unilateral notice, or advance notice of a specified period of time, with or without further conditions. Even where an oral notice would be effective, the [[effective date]] or time of termination may be directly or indirectly fixed on delivery of a written letter or email, for the sake of clarity and record. In response, different arrangements may be made or agreed, such as an earlier effective date, or improved terms and conditions of appointment upon withdrawal of the letter.

It should normally be delivered in advance to the appropriate supervisor or superior, and contain such information as the intended last day at work. A period of notice may be required expressly by contract, impliedly by the pay interval, or otherwise. Nevertheless, in practice, some resignations can be effective immediately.

For courtesy's sake, a letter of resignation may thank the employer for the pleasure of working under them and the opportunities and experience gained thereby, and also offer to assist with the transition by, for example, training the replacement. A more hostile letter may assert other sentiments or claims, particularly that the contract or terms of employment have been broken. In any case, the terms of the letter and its consequences may often be negotiated, either before or after delivery.

A formal letter with minimal expression of courtesy is then-[[President of the United States]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s letter of resignation, under the terms of a relatively unknown law passed by Congress March 1, 1792, likely drafted as the Constitution spelled out no direct procedure for how a president might resign. Delivered to then-[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] on 9 August 1974, it read simply, "I hereby resign the Office of President of the United States." It was simply dated, but the recipient also recorded upon it the time of receipt, at which it took effect with important consequences under the Constitution.

It is advisable to write a resignation letter in order to leave a good impression on one's employer or boss. The reason must be mentioned in a concise manner so that it catches the hiring managers attention. Such a resignation letter paves way for a smooth [[exit interview]] later.

'''Molecular/Genomic reference standards''' are a class of ‘controls’ or standards used to check the performance of molecular [[Diagnostic test|diagnostic assays]]. Molecular/Genomic Reference Materials (RMs) are selected or engineered to model a specific genetic [[biomarker]] as it occurs in a patient [[biopsy]]. Reference materials (RM) are used for a calibration of the measuring system, for assessment of a measurement procedure, for assigning values to materials, or for [[quality control]].

==Molecular reference materials==

Molecular reference standards are available in a variety of formats, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. These materials range from synthetic DNA [[oligonucleotide]]s or patient-derived genomic DNA, to actual patient tissue biopsies with known [[mutation]] status.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Reference Material !! Benefit !! Drawback
|-
| Recombinant [[plasmid]]s or synthesized oligonucleotides || Cheap and easy to synthesize. Can control for multiple [[allele]]s in a single reaction || Do not resemble complexity of the whole [[genome]]. Risk of [[false positive]]s
|-
| Cell Line Genomic DNA (gDNA)|| Mimics complexity of the whole genome  || Can only control for one or a few alleles/[[genotype]]s or targets at a time. 
|-
| Cell Line Mixtures || Mimics complexity of the whole genome. Can control for multiple alleles in a single reactions
|| Does not mimic the ‘[[isogenic human disease models|isogenic]]’ or similar genetic background between different cells in a tumour. 
|-
| Genetically modified cell line gDNA || Mimics complexity of the whole genome. Ability to dilute modified [[gDNA]] with unmodified gDNA  || Can only control for one or a few alleles/genotypes or targets at a time
|-
| Genetically modified cell line mixtures|| Mimics complexity of the whole genome. Ability to dilute modified gDNA with unmodified gDNA. Mimics the ‘isogenic’ background of tumour cells || ----
|-
| Patient biopsy samples|| Completely representative|| Not a sustainable source
|}

==Proficiency schemes==

Proficiency schemes involve the distribution of blinded reference materials to subscription laboratories, and the subsequent scoring and assessment of the proficiency of those labs in their molecular diagnostic testing.

Proficiency schemes are usually organized by not-for-profit organizations, usually government affiliated, to which hundreds of laboratories may subscribe. These schemes are funded with the [[subscription]] fees paid by each member laboratory.

Proficiency schemes have historically relied upon patient biopsies with known mutation status for distribution to member laboratories. However, due to the significant rise in the number of labs performing molecular testing (in turn caused by the increase in the number of available targeted drugs whose prescription is linked to the presence or absence of a particular biomarker), patient samples are becoming an unsustainable source of reference material. Increasingly, proficiency scheme organizers are turning to genetically modified cell lines as a sustainable and well defined source of reference material.

Some of the largest proficiency scheme organizers in the world include:

The '''Museumplein''' ({{IPA-nl|myˌzeːjʏmˈplɛin}}; {{Lang-en|Museum Square}}) is a [[public space]] in the [[Museumkwartier (Amsterdam)|Museumkwartier]] neighbourhood of the [[Amsterdam-Zuid]] [[stadsdeel|borough]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. Located at the Museumplein are three major museums – the [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Van Gogh Museum]], and [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]] – and the concert hall [[Concertgebouw]].&lt;ref name="mdist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum District|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/areas/amsterdam-neighbourhoods/centre/museum-quarter|website=iamsterdam.com|publisher=Amsterdam Marketing|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was originally a wax candle factory and marshy meadows. Construction began following the completion of the Rijksmuseum in 1885, with a street plan based on the design of [[Pierre Cuypers]], the museum’s celebrated architect.&lt;ref name="mdist"/&gt; The area was the location of the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|International Colonial and Export Exhibition]] in 1883.

The Museumplein was reconstructed after a design by the [[Sweden|Swedish]]/[[Denmark|Danish]] [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] [[Sven-Ingvar Andersson]] in 1999. It now includes underground parking spaces and an underground supermarket. In the winter, the pond can be transformed into an artificial [[ice skating]] area.

The space is also used for (mass) events such as [[festival]]s, [[Party|celebration]]s, and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s and  [[Armin Van Buuren]] honoured [[Netherlands national football team|The Dutch Team]] at Museumplein in 2010 by playing [[Swedish House Mafia]]. 

In July 2017 the [[2017 FIBA 3x3 Europe Cup]], the European [[3x3 basketball]] tournament, was held at the Museumplein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiba.basketball/nl/3x3europecup/2017/bereikbaarheid]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main "I amsterdam" sign is also located here in front of the Rijksmuseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/rebranding-amsterdam-and-what-it-means-to-rebrand-a-city-19539392/|title=Rebranding Amsterdam and What It Means to Rebrand a City|last=Stamp|first=Jimmy|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The sculpture "Self Portrait of a Dreamer" by Joseph Klibansky is exhibited within the pond from 26 June 2018 to 28 Aug 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://josephklibansky.com/news/13-meter-tall-self-portrait-of-a-dreamer-sculpture-on-museum-square-amsterdam|title=News: 13 meter tall “Self Portrait of a Dreamer” sculpture on Museum Square Amsterdam|website=Joseph Klibansky|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8516">The '''National Space Science Data Center''' serves as the permanent archive for [[NASA]] space science mission data. "[[Space science]]" pertains to [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]], solar and space plasma physics, and [[planetary science|planetary]] and [[lunar science]]. As the permanent archive, NSSDC teams with NASA's discipline-specific space science "active archives" which provide access to data to researchers and, in some cases, to the general public. NSSDC also serves as NASA's permanent archive for space physics mission data. It provides access to several geophysical models and to data from some non-NASA mission data.

NSSDC supports active [[space physics]] and [[astrophysics]] researchers. Web-based services allow the NSSDC to support the general public. This support is in the form of information about spacecraft and access to digital versions of selected imagery. NSSDC also
provides access to portions of their database contains information about data archived at NSSDC (and, in some cases, other facilities), the spacecraft which generate space science data and experiments which generate space science data. NSSDC services also included are data management standards and technologies.&lt;ref name=overview-about/&gt;

NSSDC is part of the Solar System Exploration Data Services Office (SSEDSO) in the Solar System Exploration Division at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. NSSDC is sponsored by the Heliophysics Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. NSSDC acts in concert with various NASA discipline data systems in providing certain data and services.&lt;ref name=overview-about/&gt;

==Overview==
NSSDC was first established at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in 1966. NSSDC's staff consists largely of physical scientists, computer scientists, analysts, programmers, and data technicians. Staffing level, including civil service and onsite contractors, has ranged between 15 and 100 over the life of NSSDC. Early in its life, NSSDC accumulated data primarily on 7-track and 9-track tape and on various photoproducts, and all data dissemination was via media replication and mailing. Starting in the mid-1980s, NSSDC received and disseminated increasing data volumes via electronic networks. Dissemination formats are presently via the internet, either via HTTP or FTP.&lt;ref name=overview-about&gt;{{Cite web

==Astrophysics ==
''Data Services'' contains data and mission information: The Multiwavelength Milky Way, the Multimedia Catalog and the NSSDC Photo Gallery.

''Flight Mission Information'' contains lists of flight missions and information about them; this is where the NSSDC Master Catalog is along with mission-specific access. A graphical interface to mission information is in this area as well.
 
''Related Information Services'' have detailed information about data held at NSSDC via the Master Catalog, NSSDC Lunar and Planetary Science, and NSSDC Heliophysics.

There are also ''NASA Astrophysics Data Archive/Service Centers''. These include HEASARC (High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center), IRSA (Infrared Science Archives), LAMBDA (Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis), MAST ([[Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes]]).

There are also other NASA archives/service centers; MSC (Michelson Science Center), NASA ADS (Astrophysics Data System), NED (NASA Extragalactic Database).&lt;ref name="astrophysics"&gt;{{Cite web

==Master Catalog==
The NSSDC Master Catalog is available for the queries pertaining to information about data that are archived at the NSSDC as well as for supplemental information via the following query mechanisms:

*Spacecraft Query. This interface allows queries to our database of orbital, suborbital, and interplanetary spacecraft.
*Experiment Query. This interface allows queries for information about scientific experiments that flew on-board various space missions.
*Data Collection Query. This interface allows queries for data that are tracked by NSSDC, primarily those that are currently archived here.
*Personnel Query. This interface allows queries for locator information for personnel that were associated with various missions and/or data collections submitted to NSSDC.
*Publication Query. This interface allows queries information about publications that are relevant to the data NSSDC archives or to the experiments and/or missions that accumulated the data. The publications so captured are not intended to be comprehensive bibliographies.
*Lunar and Planetary Map Query. This interface allows queries of the lunar and planetary maps that NSSDC currently has in stock.
*New and Updated Data Query. This interface allows queries for those data collections for which the NSSDC has recently acquired new data, either additions to existing collections or entirely new collections.

'''eDirectory''' is an [[X.500]]-compatible [[directory service]] software product from [[NetIQ]]. Previously owned by [[Novell]], the product has also been known as '''Novell Directory Services''' ('''NDS''') and sometimes referred to as ''NetWare Directory Services''. NDS was initially released by Novell in 1993 for Netware 4, replacing the Netware bindery mechanism used in previous versions, for centrally managing access to resources on multiple [[Server (computing)|servers]] and [[computer]]s within a given [[computer network|network]].  eDirectory is a hierarchical, object oriented database used to represent certain assets in an organization in a logical tree, including organizations, organizational units, people, positions, servers, volumes, workstations, applications, printers, services, and groups to name just a few.

== Features ==
[[Image:CWorthy3.png|left|400px|thumb|NetWare eDirectory [[CWorthy]] Management Tool]]
eDirectory uses dynamic rights inheritance, which allows both global and specific access controls. Access rights to objects in the tree are determined at the time of the request and are determined by the rights assigned to the objects by virtue of their location in the tree, any security equivalences, and individual assignments.  The software supports partitioning at any point in the tree, as well as replication of any partition to any number of servers. Replication between servers occurs periodically using deltas of the objects. Each server can act as a master of the information it holds (provided the replica is not read only). Additionally, replicas may be filtered to only include defined attributes to increase speed (for example, a replica may be configured to only include a name and phone number for use in a corporate address book, as opposed to the entire directory user profile).

The software supports [[referential integrity]], [[multi-master replication]], and has a modular authentication architecture. It can be accessed via [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], [[Directory Service Markup Language|DSML]], [[SOAP]], [[ODBC]], [[JDBC]], [[JNDI]], and [[Active Directory Service Interfaces|ADSI]].

== Network configuration stored in the directory ==
[[File:Netware stores server config data in eDirectory.PNG|thumb|300px|Novell stores a large amount of network and server configuration data within eDirectory. In this example, the server name is "ADMIN1". Shown is an organizational unit, user groups, print queues, disk volumes, the server itself, print servers, Novell licensing, user template, secure authentication service, encryption key pairs, service location protocol, LDAP server, DNS configuration, DHCP configuration, Bordermanager server config, Novell installation service, SNMP config]]
When Novell first designed their directory, they decided to store large amounts of their operational server data within the directory in addition to just user account information. As a result, a typical Novell directory contains a large pool of additional objects representing the servers themselves and any software services running on those servers, such as LDAP or email software.

Microsoft's [[Active Directory]] is fairly simple by comparison, typically storing only user and machine objects in their directory. Other Windows network configuration information is scattered across other databases such as the [[Windows registry]], the [[domain name server]], and specialized services such as the [[global catalog]]. NetWare integrated all these functions into eDirectory. Even file system information is stored in the directory as ''volume objects''.

== Storage ==
Versions of eDirectory prior to version 8 (then called Novell Directory Services) used a record-based database management engine called Recman, which relied on the Transaction Tracking System built into the [[NetWare]] operating system. Since version 8, eDirectory (along with the [[GroupWise]] collaboration suite, starting with version 5) uses the FLAIM (FLexible Adaptable Information Management) [[database engine]].  FLAIM is an open source embeddable database engine developed by Novell and released under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license in 2006. This change allowed for it to be ported to other platforms such as Windows, Linux, and Unix.

King’s line art for the Religious Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Chronicles Concerning Early Babylonian Kings: Vol. 2 Texts and Translations | author = [[Leonard William King|L. W. King]] | publisher = Luzac &amp; Co. | year = 1907 | pages = 157–179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Religious Chronicle''' is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n register of portents such as the straying of wild animals into urban areas and extraordinary natural phenomena which presaged the disruptions which interfered with the [[Akitu|Akītu]] or new year festival and the performance of its regular cultic activities which included the transport of the idols of the gods to the city of [[Babylon]] during the tumultuous years of chaos caused by the incursions of [[Arameans|Aramean]] nomads.

==The text==

It seems to have drawn its sources from the [[Protasis (linguistics)|protases]] of omen literature in contrast to the [[Chronicle of Early Kings]] which drew them from their [[Apodosis (linguistics)|apodoses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Predicting the past in the ancient Near East : mantic historiography in ancient Mesopotamia, Judah, and the Mediterranean world  | author = Matthew Neujahr | place = Providence, Rhode Island | series = Brown Judaic Studies | year = 2012 | page = 91 }} footnote 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet has two columns per side and is in poor condition, with the surface severely abraded and most of the left-hand side (columns I and IV) gone. It may have been part of a series as there is part of a catch-line evident on line 8 of column IV.&lt;ref name=pkb&gt;{{ cite book | title = A political History of Post-Kassite Babylonia, 1158–722 B.C. | author = J. A. Brinkman | publisher = Pontificium Institutum Biblicum | year = 1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} It is designated BM 35968 (Sp III, 504) and is held in the [[British Museum]]. Written during the [[Seleucid era]], it was acquired by the Museum from [[Spartali &amp; Co]], sponsors of much of the unofficial tablet gathering in Iraq under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] jurisdiction, in 1880, and consequently its find spot is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Chronicles Concerning Early Babylonian Kings: Vol. 1 Introductory Chapters | author = L. W. King | publisher = Luzac &amp; Co. | year = 1907 | pages = 212–240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest king to appear in the text is [[Nabu-shum-libur|Nabû-šumu-libūr]] (ca. 1033 – 1026 BC) on line 16 of the first column and the work also name-drops [[Nabû-mukin-apli]] (ca. 978 – 943 BC). The intervening text describes a reign or reigns of up to seventeen years. Only [[Simbar-shipak|Simbar-Šipak]] (ca. 1025 - 1008 BC) and [[Eulmash-shakin-shumi|Eulmaš-šākin-šumi]] (ca. 1004 – 987 BC) reigned so long during this period. The historical era covered was a period of great turmoil.

Column II, in a passage ascribed to Simbar-Šipak's reign,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Second Dynasty of Isin According to a New King-list Tablet (AS 15) | author = A. Poebel | publisher = Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago | year = 1955 | pages = 23–24 }} n. 80&lt;/ref&gt; includes a possible reference to a solar eclipse: “On the twenty-sixth day of the month Sivan, in the seventh year, day turned to night and there was a fire in the sky.” Rowton identified this with May 9, 2012 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = Mesopotamian Chronology and the 'Era of Menophres' | author = M.

'''''Road Users' Code''''' is a [[road user guide]] in [[Hong Kong]]. It is published by the [[Transport Department (Hong Kong)|Transport Department]].

There is not a single law governing the rules of the road like other jurisdictions. Licensing and road maintenance are under the purview of the Transport Department and the Highways Department respectively.

There are several motoring laws in Hong Kong:

* [[Third party insurance#Hong Kong|Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance]] - governs third party insurance for drivers
* [[Point system (driving)#Hong Kong|Road Traffic (Driving-Offence Points) Ordinance]] - sets up a point system for breach of rules of the road
* [[Road Traffic Ordinance]] - regulates road traffic and use of vehicles

'''Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle''', designated '''SA-500D''', is a prototype [[Saturn V]] rocket used by [[NASA]] to test the performance of the rocket when vibrated to simulate the shaking which subsequent rockets would experience during launch.  It was the first full-scale Saturn V completed by the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC).  Though SA-500D never flew, it was instrumental in the development of the Saturn V rocket which propelled the first men to the [[Moon]] as part of the [[Apollo program]].  Built under the direction of Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]], it served as the test vehicle for all of the Saturn support facilities at MSFC.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msfc-3SV"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Mike |title=Three Saturn Vs on Display Teach Lessons in Space History |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/display.html |publisher=Marshall Space Flight Center History Office |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DynamicTestPlan"/&gt;

SA-500D is the only Saturn V on display that was used for its intended purpose, and the only one to have been assembled prior to museum display. It is on permanent display at the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]], [[Huntsville, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="msfc-3SV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CSRestoration"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://americanspacecraft.com/pages/booster/sv-asrc.html | title=Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle | work=Field Guide to American Spacecraft | accessdate=January 4, 2016 | author=Gerard, James H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A19750674000 | title=Rocket, First Stage, S-1C-D-1C Dynamic Test Stage, Saturn V | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A19750676000 | title=Second Stage, S-II-F/D, Saturn V Launch Vehicle, Dynamic Test Version | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A19750677000 | title=S-IVB-D Dynamic Test Stage, or Third Stage, Saturn V Launch Vehicle | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Saturn | publisher=Collector's Guide Publishing, Inc. | author=Lawrie, Alan | year=2005 | pages=328 | isbn=978-1894959193 | series=Apogee Books Space Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-flight configurations==
[[File:Saturn V Vehicle Configuration.jpg|125px|left|thumb|Saturn V configurations]]
Before a [[Saturn V]] could launch, engineers needed to verify that their design had accounted for everything the rocket would encounter on its journey, from assembly to the launchpad and from Earth to the Moon.  To validate the Saturn V design and procedures, they created five pre-flight configurations for testing.  These configurations were subjected to tests simulating all aspects of flight preparations and flight itself, and all the tests needed to demonstrate satisfactory results before MSFC would certify the Saturn V to fly.

SA-500D was one of the five pre-flight configurations of the Saturn V.  This configuration showed the Saturn V's "bending and vibration characteristics" and verified "the adequacy of guidance and control systems' design."&lt;ref name="QReport17"/&gt; The rocket's {{Convert|7610000|lbf|MN|lk=on}} of thrust would generate vigorous shaking and it was important to see that the rocket would not shake apart or vibrate itself off-course.&lt;ref name="FlightManual503§4"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750063889_1975063889.pdf |title=Saturn V Flight Manual - SA-503 |author=NASA |year=1968 |publisher=NASA – George C.

The Saturn V consisted of three stages and an [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] (IU).  The first stage, [[S-IC]], delivered {{Convert|7610000|lbf|MN|lk=on}} thrust and delivered the other stages to {{Convert|200000|ft|km}}.&lt;ref name="FlightManual503§4"/&gt;  Afterwards, it was jettisoned to fall into the Atlantic Ocean and the second stage continued acceleration.&lt;ref name="FlightManual503§4"/&gt;  The second stage, [[S-II]], was responsible for lifting the remaining parts nearly to Earth orbit.&lt;ref name="FlightManual503§5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750063889_1975063889.pdf |title=Saturn V Flight Manual - SA-503 |author=NASA |year=1968 |publisher=NASA – George C.

The [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand]] with "electrodynamic shakers"&lt;ref name="QReport17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M83ZO6rH40k |title=Saturn V Quarterly Report #17 Dec 1966-Feb 1967 part 1 of 2 |author=NASA |date = February 1967|publisher=NASA |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a table capable not only of holding the Saturn V fully assembled and fueled, but also able to simulate the vibrations that would be generated by rocket engines.&lt;ref name="QReport17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QReport8"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Saturn V Quarterly Report #8 September, October, November 1964 |author=NASA |date = December 1964|publisher=NASA MSFC|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The components used for testing were developed from 1964–66,&lt;ref name="QReport16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sp4009-ap6"/&gt; and the tests conducted in 1966-67.&lt;ref name="QReport17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QReport16"/&gt;  Because the Saturn V shared some components with the [[Saturn IB]], some of the components for SA-500D were initially used for dynamic testing with the [[Saturn IB]] stack.&lt;ref name="QReport12"/&gt;

In naming the individual stages, MSFC used the stage designation with a suffix indicating its purpose.  For example, S-IC-D was the first stage, S-IC, for dynamic testing, and S-IC-1 was the first flight model of the first stage.  Suffixes used were S, for structural, F for facilities, T for all-systems test, and D for dynamic testing.

Following is a history of each component of the dynamic test article in order of appearance.

[[File:BP-27 atop Saturn IB.jpg|right|thumb|150px|BP-27 sat atop the S-IB dressed with sensors for dynamic testing as seen here before it was used for Saturn V testing.]]

=== Apollo boilerplate ===
Development of the test article started from the top.  A [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]], BP-27 together with LTA-2, was used for all configurations of dynamic testing.&lt;ref name="DynamicTestPlan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://agentdc.uah.edu/homepages/dcfiles/USSRC/SatuVDynaTestVehiTestProjPlan_073108144451.pdf | title=Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle Test Project Plan | accessdate=March 28, 2011 | date=April 16, 1965 | publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSMContract"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/CSM27_CSM_Contract_pp257-264.pdf | title=CSM Contract | accessdate=March 28, 2011 | publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ApolloSourcebook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard W. Orloff|author2=David Michael Harland|title=Apollo: the definitive sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGaUOu7ah78C|year=2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business|isbn=978-0-387-30043-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boilerplate took the place of actual flight hardware.  Boilerplate size, shape, mass and center of gravity were the same, but it was not necessary for the entire Apollo spacecraft to be complete to commence dynamic testing.  The boilerplate was outfitted with instrumentation to record data for engineering study and evaluation.&lt;ref name="APSR-2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://history.nasa.gov/apsr/Apollopt2-2.pdf | title=Apollo Program Summary Report | accessdate=March 5, 2011 |date = April 1975| publisher=NASA JSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BP-27 consisted of hardware specifically built for that configuration and some hardware reassigned from other designations.  The [[Apollo Command Module|Command Module]] and [[Launch Escape System]] were unique to BP-27.  The [[Apollo Service Module|Service Module]] SM-010 (formerly SM-006) and the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter .28SLA.29|Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter]]s SLA #1 were also assigned to BP-27.&lt;ref name="CSMContract"/&gt;

BP-27 was accepted at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) in late September, 1964.&lt;ref name="sp4009-ap6"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4009/v2app6.htm |title=The Apollo Spacecraft: A Chronology.

Shortly thereafter, MSFC took delivery of the boilerplate [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]], called a Lunar Test Article and designated LTA-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/lmstural.htm | title=LM Structural | accessdate=March 29, 2011 | author=Wade, Mark | work=Encyclopedia Astronautica}}&lt;/ref&gt; LTA-2 is the only part of SA-500D to fly in space.  It was refurbished, designated LTA-2R, and flew on [[Apollo 6]].&lt;ref name="ApolloSourcebook"/&gt;

BP-27 was used for [[Saturn IB]] dynamic testing, shipped to [[Kennedy Space Center]] to be a component of [[SA-500F]], and shipped back to MSFC for full-stack testing with SA-500D.&lt;ref name="QReport9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QReport16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elchert"/&gt;

[[File:S-IVB-D arrives for testing.jpg|150px|thumb|left|S-IVB-D arrives at MSFC for testing.]]

=== Third stage ===
The third stage, [[S-IVB]]-D arrived at MSFC before any other Saturn V stages because it was destined for dynamic testing in the [[Saturn IB]] first.&lt;ref name="MHR-5p5"/&gt;  It was assembled by [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] near [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].  With ceremony and dignitaries for the first Douglas-built S-IVB stage, it set out by barge December 8, 1964, and made its way to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] via the [[Panama Canal]], the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Rivers to MSFC, where it arrived on January 4, 1965.  The same day, MSFC took delivery of the first stage of the Saturn IB for dynamic and facilities checkout testing, [[S-IB]]-D/F.&lt;ref name="msfc-3SV"/&gt;  The parts were assembled together with the instrument unit designated S-IU-200D/500D (see below) and BP-27 for dynamic testing in the Saturn IB configuration from February to September 1965 before it was allocated to the Saturn V configuration.&lt;ref name="QReport12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MHR-5p5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MHR-5p6"/&gt;

=== Instrument Unit ===
[[File:Saturn IB and V Instrument Unit.jpg|150px|thumb|The IU was the electronics hub for Saturn V.]]
The Saturn V [[Saturn V Instrument Unit|Instrument Unit]] served as the electronics hub for the first three stages of the rocket, controlling engine firing, guidance, stage separation, and climate for the three stages below.  It consisted of two main parts, a rigid ring for structure, and within that, electronics.&lt;ref name="sp-4206-ch8"/&gt;

Instrument units had a slightly different numbering scheme than the other parts.  S-IU-200D/500D was for use with the SA-200D dynamic test article - a [[Saturn IB]], and also for use with SA-500D, the Saturn V.

[[IBM]] won the contract to build electronics for the IU, and so, by 1964, constructed a $14 million four-building complex including a manufacturing facility with [[clean room]] in Huntsville.&lt;ref name="sp-4206-ch8"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch8.htm | title=Stages to Saturn | accessdate=March 4, 2011 | author=Bilstein, Roger E. | date=2004-08-06 | work=SP-4206 | publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IU's structural ring had two responsibilities: provide a mounting location for IBM's electronics and hold everything on top of it.  It needed to be structurally sound enough to hold the weight of the Lunar Module, Service Module, Command Module and the three astronauts during the acceleration provided by three mighty stages of rocket beneath.  The rings were all fabricated at MSFC.&lt;ref name="sp-4206-ch8"/&gt;

The IU for SA-500D was not the first built.  MSFC built S-IU-200V/500V for vibration testing from September to November 1964.&lt;ref name="MHR-5p5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/MHR-5/part-5.htm |title=Saturn Illustrated Chronology - Part 5: January 1964 through December 1964 |last1=Aikens | first1=David |work= |publisher=NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wyle Laboratories|Wyle Labs]] tested it as part of the Saturn I-B program.&lt;ref name="QReport9"/&gt;

S-IU-200D/500D was the second IU to be built, with the ring completed in January 1965 and electronic components from IBM installed by February 1.  It was the last piece necessary for dynamic testing in the Saturn IB program.  It was stacked together with S-IVB-D, S-IB-D, and BP-27 for Saturn IB testing through much of 1965. On October 8, 1965, it began dynamic testing for the Saturn V program as part of SA-500D.&lt;ref name="QReport9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MHR-5p6"/&gt;

[[File:Poseidon barge transporting Saturn V S-II.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The NASA's ''Poseidon'' ferried S-IC-D to MSFC on the barge's first trip.&lt;ref name="MHR-5p6"/&gt;]]

=== First stage ===
MSFC built the first three [[S-IC]] test first stages for the Saturn V: S-IC-T, the S-IC-S, and the S-IC-F.  They also built the first two flight stages, S-IC-1 and S-IC-2.  S-IC-D was the first to be built by [[Boeing]] at the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] using the tooling that had been developed in Huntsville.&lt;ref name="sp-4206-ch7"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch7.htm | title=Stages to Saturn | accessdate=March 4, 2011 | author=Bilstein, Roger E. | date=2004-08-06 | work=SP-4206 | publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S-IC-D, was under construction on September 9, 1965 when [[Hurricane Betsy]] struck the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]].  The building housing the stage sustained severe damage, but the stage itself was repaired promptly.&lt;ref name="QReport12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Saturn V Quarterly Report #12 September, October, November 1965 |author=NASA |date = December 1965|publisher=NASA MSFC|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

S-IC-D set out on the maiden voyage of NASA barge ''Poseidon'' to [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] on October 6, 1965 and arrived at MSFC October 13.&lt;ref name="MHR-5p6"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/MHR-5/part-6.htm |title=Saturn Illustrated Chronology - Part 6: January 1965 through December 1965 |last1=Aikens | first1=David |work= |publisher=NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage was lifted into place in the Dynamic Test Stand January 13, 1966 in the picture top right. Said one observer, "Fog and clouds hovered around the top of the {{convert|360|foot}} tall test stand most of the day while the {{convert|300000| lb}} stage was being lifted from its transporter into place inside the stand, said to be the tallest building in Alabama."&lt;ref name="Star6601"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=MSFC |newspaper=Marshall Star |date=January 19, 1966 | title=Dynamics S-IC Moved (photo caption) | page=8 }} quoted in {{cite web |last=Wright |first=Mike |title=Three Saturn Vs on Display Teach Lessons in Space History |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/display.html |publisher=Marshall Space Flight Center History Office |accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second stage ===
[[File:Apollo Saturn V Test Vehicle - GPN-2000-000615.jpg|150px|thumb|S-II-F/D rolled out to the launch pad as part of SA-500F.]]
The second stage of SA-500D had a complex history. The second stage, [[S-II]]-D had been on order, but that part was cancelled February 19, 1965.  The plan was to use another test article for dynamic testing as well as its other purpose.  Two such test articles were destroyed during testing after having been designated for the dynamic test phase.  The actual article used in SA-500D was named in the third re-allocation, when S-II-F, the facilities checkout article, was designated S-II-F/D.&lt;ref name="MHR-5p6"/&gt;

S-II-S, which [[North American Aviation]]'s Space and Information Systems Division (S&amp;ID) at [[Seal Beach, California|Seal Beach]] had completed by January 31, was re-designated as S-II-S/D to be used for dynamic testing.  S-II-S/D would not survive its final structural test on September 29, 1965, but the test was exercising considerable margin above the structural integrity required for flight.&lt;ref name="QReport12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MHR-5p6"/&gt;

In January 1966, the all-systems test S-II-T was re-designated S-II-T/D, so that it might be used for dynamic testing as well as engine firing.  S-II-T/D completed integrated checkout of ground support facilities at [[John C. Stennis Space Center|MTF]] on February 3, 1966.  S-II-T/D's engines were fired five times at MTF from April to May, including a full-duration test.  On May 28, 1966, S-II-T/D was undergoing a pressure test to find a hydrogen leak, but the hydrogen pressure sensors and switches had been disconnected unbeknownst to the second-shift crew when they tried to pressurize the tank. Five technicians sustained minor injuries.  MSFC convened an investigation that night, and the team completed the report in two days.&lt;ref name="MHR-5p7"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/MHR-5/part-7.htm |title=Saturn Illustrated Chronology - Part 7: January 1966 through December 1966 |last1=Aikens | first1=David |work= |publisher=NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center |accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the S-II-T/D destruction, a third article was assigned to dynamic test duties.  Facilities checkout article S-II-F became the dynamic test article designated S-II-F/D.  S-II-F was shipped from S&amp;ID, [[Seal Beach, California]] on February 20, 1966, to [[Kennedy Space Center]] where it arrived March 4.  It filled in the final part of [[SA-500F]] to check out facilities for processing the Saturn V, replacing a dumbbell-shaped temporary stage of the same length and weight as an S-II stage. SA-500F was assembled in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] where it was mated to S-IC-F on March 28 and S-IVB-F the next day.

SA-500F was completed in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|VAB]], tested for stability against swaying in the wind,&lt;ref name="sneakerTest"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-010708a.html |title=Untold Apollo:How tennis shoes and tug-of-war toppled the mighty Saturn V |last1=Lawrie |first1=Alan |last2=Pearlman |first2=Robert |date=January 7, 2008  |publisher=CollectSpace.com |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rolled out to the launch pad May 25, 1966, on [[Mobile Launcher Platform|Mobile Launcher 1]].

[[File:S-II-F arrives at MSFC.jpg|150px|right|thumb|S-II-F/D arrives at MSFC.]]
[[Hurricane Alma (1966)|Hurricane Alma]] interrupted exercises as SA-500F was rolled back to the VAB on June 8, though the ground crew supposed the rollback was more of an exercise than necessity because winds remained below critical for the entire storm.&lt;ref name="sneakerTest"/&gt;  It was returned to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|pad 39]]-A two days later and finally returned to the VAB October 14, 1966 for disassembly.&lt;ref name="msfc-3SV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QReport16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIJ-fNSNYXY |title=Saturn V Quarterly Report #16 Sep-Nov 1966 Part 1 of 2 |author=NASA |date = February 1967|publisher=NASA |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MHR-5p7"/&gt;

After facilities checkout at KSC was completed, the remaining components of SA-500F were then transferred to MSFC for inclusion in SA-500D: the Apollo boilerplate BP-27 and S-II-F/D.  The second stage was modified for dynamic testing, and shipped by ''Posideon'' from KSC on October 29 to arrive at MSFC November 10, 1966.&lt;ref name="QReport16"/&gt;

== Dynamic testing ==
[[File:Saturn V Dynamic Test Configurations.png|300px|right|thumb|Dynamic testing involved three vehicle configurations with various fuel loads.&lt;ref name="DynamicTestPlan"/&gt;]]
Engineers needed a detailed knowledge of the space vehicle's dynamic flight characteristics to design structural, guidance, and flight control systems.  They initially used analytical data that had not been substantiated by test for design criteria.  The Dynamic Test Vehicle test project determined the dynamic characteristics of the space vehicle and verified earlier analyses.&lt;ref name="DynamicTestPlan"/&gt;

The objectives of the dynamic tests were to:

{{quote|
# Determine the space vehicle structural dynamic characteristics under conditions simulating flight configuration and environment insofar as practicable.
# Determine the optimum location for flight sensors and obtain experimental transfer functions for the control system.
# Determine the physical mating capability of stages and modules.
# Compare dynamic test results with subsequent flight test results for continuous development of dynamic test techniques and facilities to assure the highest possible degree of accuracy in the development of future vehicle structures prior to flight.
# Determine the space vehicle dynamic characteristics under conditions simulating transport from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad insofar as practicable.
|NASA|Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle Test Project Plan&lt;ref name="DynamicTestPlan"/&gt;|}}

Dynamic tests came in three configurations, one for each phase of Saturn V-powered flight.  Configuration I focused on testing the entire stack, as if the vehicle had just launched.  Configuration II exercised the stack as if the first stage had jettisoned and the second stage were firing, and configuration III tested just the third stage and Apollo spacecraft.  Tests began with Configuration III in the Saturn IB Dynamic Test Facility, while the [[Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand]], first, and second stages were still under construction.  Configuration I testing followed in the Saturn V Dynamic Test Stand, then Configuration II in the same place.&lt;ref name="DynamicTestPlan"/&gt;

Configuration III testing took place in late 1965.&lt;ref name="DynamicTestPlan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QReport12"/&gt;

[[File:SA-500D in Dynamic Test Stand Configuration I.jpg|150px|right|thumb|In Configuration One, SA-500D was fully assembled inside the Dynamic Test Facility.]]
Configuration I dynamic tests required the first stage of the Saturn V, which was loaded into the test stand January 13, 1966.  Testing would have to wait for the last piece, the second stage, to arrive.&lt;ref name="Star6601"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MHR-5p8"/&gt;

With all the components at MSFC as of November 10, 1966,&lt;ref name="QReport16"/&gt; the second stage was stacked atop the first inside the Dynamic Test Stand on November 23.  The third stage was added to the stack November 30, and the Instrument Unit and boilerplate Apollo were installed in December.  The rocket was stacked and ready for "Configuration One" testing.&lt;ref name="QReport16"/&gt;

Configuration One Testing ran from January through March.  Testing produced "several minor irregularities indicating the need for possible engineering changes" which were addressed during March, 1967.&lt;ref name="QReport17"/&gt;

Configuration Two testing followed, in which the first stage was removed from the stack to simulate conditions after the first stage had jettisoned.&lt;ref name="QReport16"/&gt;

Dynamic testing examined "the vehicle's response to lateral, longitudinal, and torsional excitation, simulating those that would be experienced in flight.  The vehicle was "mounted on a hydrodynamic support system made up of four hydraulic/pneumatic pedestals to permit a simulated unrestrained reaction."  Engineers tested vibrations in one plane at a time with different amounts of ballast simulating "fuel load at critical time points in the flight trajectory." &lt;ref name="DynamicTestPlan"/&gt;

NASA historian Mike Wright summarizes the testing:

{{quote|Combined, the tests involved 450 hours of shaking to gather data from some 800 measuring points. A simulated Apollo capsule with the same weight and same center of gravity as the spacecraft being checked out for launch at Kennedy Space Center were placed on top of the rocket. Forces were applied to the tail of the rocket to simulate engine thrusting, and various other flight factors were fed to the vehicle to test reactions. During some of the shaking tests, the rocket moved as much as 6 inches at the top and up to 3 inches at the bottom. The tests were mandatory before the Center could certify that the guidance system would hold the rocket on course when it was launched.&lt;ref name="msfc-3SV"/&gt;}}

On August 3, 1967, MSFC announced the successful completion of the dynamic test program, thereby declaring dynamics and structures of the Saturn V ready for its first launch later in the year. The dynamic testing resulted in "several slight modifications" to the final flight vehicle.&lt;ref name="MHR-5p8"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/MHR-5/part-8.htm |title=Saturn Illustrated Chronology - Part 6: January 1967 through December 1967 |last1=Aikens | first1=David |publisher=NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PAO67-161"&gt;PAO Press Release No. 67-161, August 3, 1967; Press Release No. 67-162, August 4, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Saturn V launch came three months later, with [[Apollo 4]]. The dynamic test article LTA-2 was refurbished and flown on the next Saturn V launch, [[Apollo 6]].&lt;ref name="ApolloSourcebook"/&gt;

After dynamic testing, the second stage returned to KSC for a time for launchpad B checkout.&lt;ref name="QReport16"/&gt;

SA-500D was added to the [[List of Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks]] by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] in 1980 and declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[National Park Service]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Saturn V Launch Vehicle|url={{NHLS url|id=78000500}} |date=August 23, 1977|first=Edward O.|last=Buckbee|publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=78000500|title=Accompanying photos, exterior and interior, from 19 and 19.|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(664&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asme.org/about-asme/who-we-are/engineering-history/landmarks/53-saturn-v-rocket|title=Saturn V Rocket #53|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the museum assumed its current name, [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/search?q=us+space+and+rocket+center&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5pt1Tea3AYLE0QGfxdniBg&amp;ved=0CBYQpwUoCw&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=nws:1,cdr:1,cd_min:3/13/1989,cd_max:6/4/1989&amp;tbm=#q=us+space+and+rocket+center&amp;hl=en&amp;tbs=nws:1,cdr:1,cd_min:3/13/1989,cd_max:6/4/1989&amp;ei=aJx1TauHIeW_0QHBp7HVBg&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N&amp;bav=on.2,or.&amp;fp=ac56f9c8492699d3 | title=Google news search showing old and new names | accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration ===
After decades of the vehicle resting unprotected outdoors, the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]] commissioned the restoration of the vehicle in 2005.  Analysis by Conservation Solutions, Incorporated determined significant damage from both weather and pest infestations.  Various materials comprising the vehicle, including metal alloys and non-metal materials such as polyurethane foam and fiberglass, exhibited significant deterioration.  After conducting the analysis, full restoration of the Saturn V vehicle began in June 2005.&lt;ref name="CSRestoration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturn V Rocket, US Space and Rocket Center|url=https://conservationsolutionsinc.com/projects/view/529/saturn-v-rocket-conservation-us-space-and-rocket-center/|publisher=Conservation Soltutions, Inc.|accessdate=4 January 2016|archivedate=4 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104202146/https://conservationsolutionsinc.com/projects/view/529/saturn-v-rocket-conservation-us-space-and-rocket-center/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davidson Center-27527-2.jpg|center|400px|Saturn V in Davidson Center for Space Exploration]]
Restoration culminated in July 2007 when the Saturn V was moved into a building designed as protection for the artifact and to provide additional museum facilities. The move took place from July 10 to approximately July 17, starting with the first stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum41/HTML/000136.html | title=Topic:   Davidson Center for Space Exploration (AL) | accessdate=March 6, 2011 | publisher=CollectSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Davidson Center for Space Exploration]] opened in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huntsville.about.com/od/photogallery/ig/Saturn-V/ |title= Saturn V: National Historic Landmark |author=Jean Brandau |date = July 2007|publisher=About.com |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huntsville.about.com/b/2008/02/07/davidson-center-for-space-exploration.htm |title= Saturn V: National Historic Landmark |author=Jean Brandau |date=February 7, 2008 |publisher=About.com |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2012, an unknown person fired three [[.308 Winchester|.308 caliber bullets]] from [[Interstate 565]] at the Davidson Center, breaking three windows. Two bullets struck SA-500D's third stage marring paint and leaving dents.

}}'''Schema.org''' is a collaborative community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.w3.org/community/meat/2016/02/04/more-about-our-mission/ |title = About schema.org initiative |publisher = W3C |accessdate = 28 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webmasters use this shared vocabulary to structure metadata on their websites and to help search engines understand the published content.

== History ==

'''Schema.org''' is an initiative launched on June 2, 2011 by [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[Google]] and [[Yahoo!]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/introducing-schemaorg-search-engines.html Introducing schema.org: Search engines come together for a richer web], Google blog, 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.bing.com/search/2011/06/02/introducing-schema-org-bing-google-and-yahoo-unite-to-build-the-web-of-objects/ Introducing Schema.org: Bing, Google and Yahoo Unite to Build the Web of Objects], Bing blog, 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (operators of the world's largest [[search engine]]s at that time)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://gs.statcounter.com/#search_engine-ww-monthly-201010-201012 |title = Top 5 Search Engines from Oct to Dec 10 |publisher = StatCounter |accessdate = 17 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to create and support a common set of schemas for structured data markup on web pages. In November 2011, [[Yandex]] (whose search engine is the largest in Russia) joined the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/01/yandex-joins-google-yahoo-and-bing-to-collaborate-on-schema-org/|title=Yandex joins Google, Yahoo! and Bing to collaborate on Schema.org - TechCrunch|first=|last=nate451|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.schema.org/2011/11/yandex-now-supports-schemaorg-markup.html|title=Yandex now supports schema.org markup|website=blog.schema.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They propose using the schema.org vocabulary along with the [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]], [[RDFa]], or [[JSON-LD]] formats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schema.org/docs/gs.html|title=Getting Started - schema.org|website=schema.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mark up website content with [[metadata]] about itself. Such markup can be recognized by [[search engine spider]]s and other [[parsers]], thus granting access to the meaning of the sites (see [[Semantic Web]]). The initiative also describes an extension mechanism for adding additional properties.&lt;ref name="Extension"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.schema.org/docs/extension.html |title = Extending Schemas |date = 2011-06-02 |work = schema.org |accessdate = 2 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public discussion of the initiative largely takes place on the W3C public vocabularies mailing list.&lt;ref name="Discussion"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/ |title = W3C web vocabularies mailing list |date = 2013-07-22 |work = w3.org |accessdate = 22 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[GoodRelations]] ontology was integrated into Schema.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.schema.org/2012/11/good-relations-and-schemaorg.html|title=Good Relations and Schema.org|website=blog.schema.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the vocabulary on Schema.org was inspired by earlier formats, such as [[microformat]]s, [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]], and [[OpenCyc]].&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.schema.org/docs/faq.html |title = FAQ |work = schema.org |accessdate = 2 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microformats, with its most dominant representative [[hCard]], continue (as of 2015) to be published widely on the web, where the deployment of Schema.org has strongly increased between 2012 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata |date = 2015-04-13 |work = 3.1.

=== Microdata ===
The following is an example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schema.org/docs/gs.html#microdata_itemscope_itemtype|title=Getting Started - schema.org|website=schema.org|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of how to mark up information about a movie and its director using the Schema.org schemas and [[Microdata (HTML)|microdata]]. In order to mark up the data, the attribute &lt;code&gt;itemtype&lt;/code&gt; along with the [[URL]] of the schema is used. The attribute &lt;code&gt;itemscope&lt;/code&gt; defines the scope of the itemtype. The kind of the current item can be defined by using the attribute &lt;code&gt;itemprop&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="html5"&gt;
&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Movie"&gt;
  &lt;h1 itemprop="name"&gt;Avatar&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;div itemprop="director" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"&gt;
  Director: &lt;span itemprop="name"&gt;James Cameron&lt;/span&gt; 
(born &lt;time itemprop="birthDate" datetime="1954-08-16"&gt;August 16, 1954&lt;/time&gt;)
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;span itemprop="genre"&gt;Science fiction&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;a href="../movies/avatar-theatrical-trailer.html" itemprop="trailer"&gt;Trailer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== RDFa 1.1 Lite ===
&lt;source lang="html5"&gt;
&lt;div vocab="http://schema.org/" typeof="Movie"&gt;

  &lt;span property="genre"&gt;Science fiction&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;a href="../movies/avatar-theatrical-trailer.html" property="trailer"&gt;Trailer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

'''She-Hulk''' ('''Jennifer Walters''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Buscema]], she first appeared in ''Savage She-Hulk'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d February 1980). Following an injury, Walters received an emergency blood transfusion from her cousin, [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]], and acquired a milder version of his Hulk condition. As such, Walters becomes a large, powerful green-hued version of herself while still largely retaining her personality. In particular, she retains her intelligence and emotional control, although like Hulk, she still becomes stronger if enraged. In later issues of the comics, her transformation is permanent.

She-Hulk has been a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Heroes for Hire]], the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], [[Fantastic Force]], and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] As a highly skilled [[lawyer]], she has served as legal counsel to various superheroes on numerous occasions.&lt;ref name="mnyc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
[[File:shehulk1st.jpg|thumb|left|First appearance of the She-Hulk from issue #1 of her first title ''Savage She-Hulk''. Art by [[John Buscema]].]]
She-Hulk was created by [[Stan Lee]], who wrote only the first issue, and was the last character he created for [[Marvel Comics]]&lt;ref name=toonopedia&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/she-hulk.htm She-Hulk at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6oTqluFzk?url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-Hulk Archived] from the original on February 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; until his return to comics with ''[[Ravage 2099]]'' in 1992. The reason behind the character's creation had to do with the success of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (1977–82) and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' TV series. Marvel was afraid that the show's executives might suddenly introduce a female version of the Hulk, as had been done with ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', so Marvel decided to publish their own version of such a character to make sure that if a similar one showed up in the TV series, Marvel would own the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chipman |first=Bob "Moviebob" |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/9260-She-Hulk-Shaming |title=She-Hulk Shaming |website=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6892313.ece?token=null&amp;offset=24&amp;page=3 Jacko tried to buy Spider-Man: 70 facts you didn't know about Marvel]&lt;/ref&gt;

All but the first issue of ''The Savage She-Hulk'' were written by [[David Anthony Kraft]] and penciled by [[Mike Vosburg]], and most issues were inked by [[Frank Springer]]. Vosburg later remarked, "The oddest thing about that book was that Frank drew really beautiful women, I drew really beautiful women, and yet, the She-Hulk was never overly attractive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Aushenker|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Aushenker|date= August 2009|title= From Vixens to Villains: Mike Vosburg|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|pages= 32–38|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Savage She-Hulk'' series lasted until 1982 where it ended with #25 (March 1982). She-Hulk then made guest appearances in other characters' books. Her earliest guest-starring adventures followed no specific story line, besides her recurring bad luck with automobiles. She-Hulk also appeared in the limited series, ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]'' (June to August 1982), in which numerous superheroes are kidnapped from Earth to fight in [[outer space|space]].

She-Hulk becomes a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #221 (July 1982). Her early Avengers appearances continued the [[running gag]] about her car troubles.{{clarify|date=December 2017}} She-Hulk also made occasional guest appearances in ''The Incredible Hulk''. Her appearance in ''Avengers'' #233 (July 1983) was drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], who would later become strongly associated with the character. &lt;!--Perhaps someone could verify whether ''Avengers'' #233 was Byrne's very first She-Hulk art?--&gt;

At the conclusion of the first ''[[Secret Wars]]'' miniseries, She-Hulk joins the Fantastic Four (''Fantastic Four'' #265, April 1984). During She-Hulk's tenure with the Fantastic Four, she appeared in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #16: ''The Aladdin Effect'', ''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #17: ''Revenge of the Living Monolith'', and ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18: ''The Sensational She-Hulk''. All three graphic novels appeared in 1985. The last, #18, appearing in November 1985, was written and illustrated by then-Fantastic Four writer/artist John Byrne.

She-Hulk regained a solo series in 1989, ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' (maintaining the 1985 [[graphic novel]]'s title). ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' ran for sixty issues. Issues #1 to #8, #31 to #46, and #48 to 50 were written and drawn by Byrne. Byrne's She-Hulk stories [[satirized]] comic books and introduced She-Hulk's [[fourth wall|awareness that she is a comic book character]]. Two issues tested the limits of the [[Comics Code Authority|comics code]]: #34 makes reference to the 1991 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' cover in which actress [[Demi Moore]] appeared nude (and pregnant); in issue #40 She-Hulk is entirely [[Nudity|naked]] with her [[breast]]s and [[genital area]] covered by blur lines as she is depicted jumping rope in the nude. Other writers to contribute to this series include [[Steve Gerber]] (#10, 11, 13–23), [[Simon Furman]], and [[Peter David]].

During ''Sensational She-Hulk'', the character continued making numerous guest appearances. In 1990, She-Hulk appeared in the two-issue limited series ''She-Hulk: Ceremony''.

''The Sensational She-Hulk'' ran until issue #60 (February 1994), making it the longest-running solo title of any Marvel superheroine up to that point.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} After the cancellation of She-Hulk's second solo series, she continued making backup, one-shot, and team appearances in ''Fantastic Force'' (starting with issue #13 in November 1995), the 1996 miniseries ''[[Doc Samson]]'' #1–4 (January–April 1996), ''Heroes for Hire'' #8 to #19 (February 1998 through the series finale in January 1999), and ''The Avengers''. Her next major appearance was in the May 2002 one-shot titled ''Thing and She-Hulk: The Long Night''.

[[File:She-Hulk Vol 1 1.png|thumb|Cover of ''She-Hulk'' #1 (May 2004) by [[Adi Granov]]]]
In May 2004, ''She-Hulk'' was given a new title and launched in a wave of six new Marvel books. Despite favorable critical notices, the new series could not escape the low sales numbers that the titles received from their initial cluster-style launch.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Marvel brought the series to a close with #12 and promised a re-launch of the title (as a "second season") eight months later.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The eight-month gap is alluded to in the body of the story itself.

With the original creative team ([[Dan Slott]] and Juan Bobillo) from the previous series, the book returned eight months later as promised in October 2005. The third issue was billed as the 100th issue of a She-Hulk comic book, and had story art by numerous artists, including Vosburg. There was no new artwork by Buscema or Byrne, who were represented by reprints of ''Sensational She-Hulk'' #1 and ''Savage She-Hulk'' #1.

Dan Slott's last issue is #21; with 33 issues, Slott has written the most solo issues of She-Hulk. [[Peter David]] became the new writer with ''She-Hulk'' #22. Marvel Comics announced that ''She-Hulk'' #38 (February 2009) would be the final issue of the series. Peter David commented on his [[blog]] that sales of the book were hurt due to discrepancies between his book and [[Jeph Loeb]]'s ''Hulk'' series, caused by editorial error:

==Fictional character biography==

===Savage She-Hulk===
Jennifer Walters, the [[cousin]] of [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner (Hulk)]], is the small and somewhat shy daughter of [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Los Angeles County Sheriff]] William Morris Walters and [[Elaine Banner|Elaine (née Banner) Walters]] (who died in a car crash when Jennifer was seventeen).&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Walter's death was revealed much later in the letter pages of Sensational She-Hulk #47&lt;/ref&gt; Operatives of [[Nicholas Trask]], a [[crime boss]] who had crossed paths with her father, shot and seriously wounded her on a day that Bruce Banner happened to be in town for a visit. Since no other donors with her [[blood type]] were available, Banner provided his own blood for a transfusion; as they already shared the same blood type and [[DNA]], his [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] blood, combined with her anger transformed Jennifer into the green-skinned She-Hulk when the mobsters tried to finish her off at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage She-Hulk'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

As She-Hulk, Jennifer possessed [[metahuman|powers]] similar to those of her cousin, though at a reduced level. She also possessed a less monstrous, more [[female body shape|amazonian]] appearance. Initially, the transformation to her She-Hulk form was triggered (as with Bruce Banner's) by anger. Like her cousin Bruce, his counterpart, the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], [[Doc Samson]], and most other persons mutated by exposure to gamma radiation over the years, her mutated form was originally explained as being molded by her subconscious desire to look like the ideal woman. She eventually gains control of her transformations when [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] cures her of a lethal blood disease. As a criminal defense lawyer, she defended Dr. Michael Morbius in his trial for his vampiric killings.&lt;ref&gt;''Savage She-Hulk'' #11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Jennifer decides that she is going to retain her She-Hulk form permanently—preferring the freedom, confidence, and assertiveness that it gave her compared to her more timorous and fragile "normal" form. After her brief solo career, she joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #221&lt;/ref&gt; This led to her being transported to Battleworld by the [[Beyonder]] and her participation in the Secret Wars,&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; most notable for sparking her long-standing rivalry with the newly empowered [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; After the heroes returned to Earth, she temporarily replaced the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] as a member of the [[Fantastic Four]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #265&lt;/ref&gt;

During her tenure with the Fantastic Four, She-Hulk had to prevent a radiation leak in a downed [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]]. This radiation exposure had a drastic effect on Jennifer: she could no longer transform back into her original human form.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Graphic Novel #18: Sensational She-Hulk''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was an agreeable turn of events for her, since she preferred being She-Hulk, and it was revealed much later that the block was purely psychological.

Shortly after that, she appeared before the Supreme Court, where she battled Titania again.&lt;ref&gt;''Solo Avengers'' #14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensational She-Hulk===
After her Fantastic Four years, She-Hulk rejoined the Avengers for a while. She became hypnotized by the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]] into becoming a performer in his circus, and battled the [[Headmen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; With Spider-Man, she defeated the Headmen&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; and became an assistant District Attorney and began working for New York City [[district attorney]] Blake Tower. Here she met Louise "Weezie" Grant Mason, formerly the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroine the [[Blonde Phantom]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; She had a long series of unusual encounters including when she battled [[Doctor Bong]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; first contended against [[Xemnu|Xemnu the Titan]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #6–7&lt;/ref&gt; encountered "Nick St. Christopher",&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; and encountered "Spragg the Living Hill/Comet".&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #31&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sensational She-Hulk #15'' introduced a grey version of She-Hulk that appeared at night only and shared a lot in common with the Hulk, such as having a childlike mind, speaking in third person and divorcing from her Jennifer Walters identity, referering to Jennifer as "puny Jennifer", She-Hulk returned to normal in the following issue, with her green coloration returning in ''Sensational She-Hulk #17''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Huk'' #15-17&lt;/ref&gt; She-Hulk later discovered that Louise Mason had manipulated Tower into hiring her, so that Mason might again star in a comic book (and thus avoid dying of old age). Later, while doing legal work for [[Heroes for Hire]], She-Hulk spent some time dating [[Luke Cage]].

After a time, She-Hulk returns to the Avengers. Repeated exposure to the presence of her teammate [[Jack of Hearts]], who has the innate ability to absorb radiation that is around him, leads to She-Hulk being unable to control her changes, which resulted in her tearing the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] in half. It is then revealed that all of the events were caused by the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Now, when she is afraid, she not only turns into She-Hulk but her mind became maddened by paranoia and rage. Jennifer flees, fearing that she will endanger her friends and others, leading to the "Search for She-Hulk" storyline.

The other Avengers track her to the town of Bone, [[Idaho]], where Jennifer is lying low but the anxiety of being found prompts her to change, causing her to damage much of the town. Her cousin shows up but fails to reason with her; he "hulks out" and the two fight—the devastation to the town subsequently being blamed on the Hulk.

Psychological limitations inhibit her transformation between her two forms. For a time, as detailed in "She-Hulk" #4, March 2006, Jennifer works as a relief volunteer helping to repair Bone. She gains confidence after solving a murder mystery, reveals her green alter-ego to the entire town, and then uses her strength to make many more repairs. This, combined with Leonard Samson's new 'gamma-charger', gives her full control over her transformations for, as she said, 'the time being'.

===''JLA/Avengers''===
In the [[DC Comics|DC]]/Marvel crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', She-Hulk first appears being brainwashed by [[Starro]] when the Avengers battle her, grabbing a startled [[Ms. Marvel]] ([[Carol Danvers]]) by her leg, before the latter blasts her away with her powers.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; She later assists the Avengers in the subsequent hunt for the twelve artifacts needed to trap the DC villain [[Krona (DC Comics)|Krona]], first battling [[Aquaman]] in [[Asgard]], and later in the [[Savage Land]] with the rest of the heroes.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; During the final battle against Krona and his forces, she assists [[Wonder Woman]] in her battle against [[Surtur]], and eventually appears at the end as one of the heroes that started out the entire event.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single Green Female===
The events of ''The Search for She-Hulk'', combined with her own lack of personal responsibility and the potential legal ramifications of her saving the world swaying juries leads Jennifer back to the legal profession in a more full-time capacity, when she was asked to practice law in the Superhuman Law division of the New York firm of [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg &amp; Holliway]] (GLK&amp;H).{{Issue|date=October 2009}} This offer is dependent upon Jennifer remaining human while she worked for the firm.

While practicing at GLK&amp;H, Jennifer gradually becomes comfortable as both She-Hulk and Jennifer Walters, realizing that she has much to offer the world in both forms.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} During one of these adventures she realizes her strength as She-Hulk is dependent on her strength as Walters and works out in her human form. Thus, she exponentially increases her powers as She-Hulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |issue=8 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===
She-Hulk registered under the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], and is a supporter of Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]). However, as an attorney, she advised individuals on both sides of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. She agreed to file suit against Peter Parker for fraud on behalf of her father-in-law, ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Her intention is to keep the suit tied up in the courts indefinitely. She is also the lawyer for [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] in ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]''.

In ''She-Hulk'' #14 (2006), [[Clay Quartermain]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] informs Jennifer that she has been drafted into the organization as a result of her registration. Her mission is to fight various foes of the Hulk while training heroes under the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]]. She serves with the [[Hulkbusters]]: Clay Quartermain, Agent Crimson, [[Agent Cheesecake]] and Agent Beefcake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=2 |issue=18 |date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''World War Hulk''===
Due to her involvement in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], She-Hulk derives a bit of information suggesting that the organization knows of her cousin's whereabouts. Anticipating a problem, Tony Stark has She-Hulk secretly injected with [[S.P.I.N. (Super-Power-Inhibiting Nanobots) Technology|S.P.I.N. Tech]] that transforms her to human form. Enraged, she tells Stark that, although he may have taken She-Hulk out of the equation, he still has to face Jennifer Walters, one of the best lawyers in the country. Jennifer informs Stark that he's miscalculated: She-Hulk would have just pummeled him, but Jennifer Walters has the ability to destroy him.

On her way home, Jennifer runs into [[Amadeus Cho]], a young genius out looking for friends of the Hulk. Cho, whom the Hulk once saved, discovered what the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] had done to the Hulk, and he wants help in finding him. Cho temporarily restores Jennifer's powers so that she can take out Doc Samson, who came to apprehend Cho for [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and Tony Stark. Cho says he can permanently restore Jennifer's powers if she'll join him, but she politely refuses, instead directing him to [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]].

In ''World War Hulk'' #1, a re-powered She-Hulk assists in the evacuation of [[Manhattan]]; in #2, she tries to reason with her cousin, who has just destroyed [[Stark Tower]] during his battle with Iron Man. The Hulk warns her to leave, but she stands her ground. After she lands a punch squarely to his face, the Hulk smashes her into the ground, creating a crater around her body. As he moves on to his next confrontation, all Jennifer can say is: "God help us all."

Jennifer is held captive with the other defeated heroes at [[Madison Square Garden]], which the Hulk has converted into a gladiatorial arena. The heroes have been implanted with the same obedience discs that compelled the Hulk and his allies to fight one another during their time on the planet Sakaar.

In ''She-Hulk'' #19, Jennifer returns to the law firm to work on suing Tony Stark for stealing her powers. She is [[subpoena]]ed to give a testimony in a case in which [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg &amp; Holliway|Mallory Book]] is trying to prove that the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]'s criminal acts are the result of a shift of personality induced by his mutation, and an addiction to his gamma irradiated powers, and that he thus can't be held accountable for his actions. During her testimony, Jennifer realizes that she herself is "addicted" to being She-Hulk; Mallory forces her to admit that she's had a long list of sexual partners as She-Hulk. After the testimony, Pug appears and the two spend an evening together as friends, which cheers her up. She confronts Mallory the next day and tells her that she'll put a stop to her Leader case. However, in ''She-Hulk'' #20, it is revealed that the Leader has been acquitted of his crimes.

There is an apparent inconsistency between the ''She-Hulk'' and ''World War Hulk'' comics: in ''She-Hulk'' #19, the Leader is on trial in New York City, which is being cleaned up after the Hulk's recent attack. The action in the issue takes place during or after the events of World War Hulk. However, Jennifer appears as She-Hulk in the first and second issues of "World War Hulk," during which the Hulk is destroying New York City. The discrepancy is resolved in ''She-Hulk'' #20: Jennifer explains that Tony Stark temporarily disabled the nanobots to allow her to assist in the battle against her cousin, only to reactivate them when the battle was over. She amends her suit against Stark to demand the permanent deactivation of the nanobots.

===Post-World War Hulk===
At some point after ''World War Hulk'', Jennifer was brought before the [[Living Tribunal]]&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' #20&lt;/ref&gt; and asked to weigh her universe against a newer, better "cosmic [[trophy wife]]" version, described by Walters as "an '''[[Ultimate Marvel|ultimate]]''' universe." Her universe wins, and she resigns from the [[Living Tribunal#The Magistrati|Magistrati]].

After the Leader's trial, [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg &amp; Holliway#Employee Roster|Artie Zix]] reveals himself as [[Living Tribunal#The Magistrati|RT-Z9]] and holds the main staff of GLK&amp;H hostage while asking them questions at the behest of a group of aliens from a corner of the galaxy recently discovered by the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] Qyre. The aliens, called The Recluses, wish to keep their existence a secret. She-Hulk earlier decreed that Qyre not reveal knowledge of the Recluses' existence at the meetings of the Watchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=1 |issue=7 |date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had serious repercussions: it is revealed at the close of ''She-Hulk'' #20 that an evil being has conquered that portion of the galaxy, and is preparing an assault on all of creation. Qyre, who holds knowledge of the plan, is unable to speak of it to anyone else. At She-Hulk's time trial, it was revealed that her actions made a destructive event called the Reckoning War possible. However, comments made by the future [[Southpaw (comics)|Southpaw]], divulge that the war, though a terrible and dark time, will be favorably resolved.

A permanently depowered Jennifer Walters finds that tourists from an alternate universe&amp;nbsp;– designated the Alpha universe&amp;nbsp;– are crossing into her universe&amp;nbsp;– which they call Beta&amp;nbsp;– to gain access to superpowers and comes face to face with her own powered up doppelganger. Jennifer confirms that her Alpha counterpart slept with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] but her anger quickly turns to sorrow as she realizes that without her abilities, the Alpha Jennifer Walters&amp;nbsp;– while unfamiliar with superhuman law&amp;nbsp;– is far better suited to life in the Beta universe. Realizing this, she decides that she will go to the Alpha universe and let the other Jennifer Walters take over for her.

As she steps through the portal, Reed Richards realizes he can use the previously stored configuration of the Alpha She-Hulk to restore Jennifer's powers. Having regained her abilities, Jennifer remains in her home reality, while the Alpha Jen Walters returns to her own universe and reconciles with her boyfriend, the Alpha Augustus "Pug" Pugliese.

At an unspecified time after World War Hulk, She-Hulk assists [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] with [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]'s murder investigation.&lt;ref name="Hulk' #1 2008"&gt;{{cite comic|title=Hulk |issue=1 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Stark's Helicarrier she is attacked and beaten by the [[Red Hulk]], but vows to get even for the deliberate humiliation.&lt;ref name="King-Size Hulk #1 2008"&gt;{{cite comic|title=King-Size Hulk |issue=1 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later helps to prevent casualties in [[San Francisco]] after the Red Hulk caused an earthquake in the area,&lt;ref name="Hulk' #5 2008"&gt;{{cite comic|title=Hulk |issue=5 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assembles [[Thundra]] and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] together to capture him.&lt;ref name="Hulk' #7 2008"&gt;{{cite comic|title=Hulk |issue=7 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some months after regaining her abilities, Jennifer was tasked to defend an accused killer named Arthur Moore. While she was successful in defending him, immediately after his freedom was secured he claimed to be guilty and showed her images of the crimes he had been accused of. Jennifer's horror at what she was being shown, combined with Moore's gloating, was enough to push her rage so far that she became The Savage She-Hulk once again. She attacked him and threatened to kill him if he wasn't given the death penalty. She also told everybody within earshot that he was guilty and backed up her accusation by revealing [[attorney–client privilege|privileged information]]. This resulted in her being [[disbarment|disbarred]]. Jennifer later found out that Moore really was innocent; the images he had shown her had been false. It was also revealed, albeit not to Jennifer, that Moore had hoped to get her to react exactly the way she did since his employers wanted She-Hulk disbarred for purposes as yet unknown. Unable to practice law any more, Jennifer began working for Freeman Bonds Inc.&amp;nbsp;– a subsidiary of GLK&amp;B&amp;nbsp;– as a bounty hunter with her [[Skrull]] partner [[Jazinda]].

She was later recruited by Stark as a member of an [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]]-sponsored incarnation of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] for a short while until Tony Stark disbanded the team.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Defenders'': May–October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Afterwards, she continued to aid team leader [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] for a brief time.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} That was until she was fully able to join the team on Nighthawk's request and that it would be away from the Initiative.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Together they have several adventures, even encountering Hercules, but they soon ended up involved in the midst of [[Secret Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. ''X-Factor'' (vol 3) #33 &amp; 34; (September &amp; October 2008); ''She-Hulk'' #31–33 (September–November 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret Invasion===
During the Skrull takeover of Earth during [[Secret Invasion]], She-Hulk and Jazinda hunt down a member of the Skrulls who functions as their religious leader. [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] initially impedes her progress, but they part ways on uncertain terms. She-Hulk and Jazinda capture the Skrull and the two heroines take the Skrull to New York, where they encounter the [[Super-Skrull]], Kl'rt.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' Vol.2 #32&lt;/ref&gt; Kl'rt came to kill his daughter, Jazinda, going so far as to shoot her in the head. Due to her regenerative properties, Jazinda was still not fully dead. The Skrull religious leader wants to completely remove her regenerative ability but Kl'rt stops him after She-Hulk pleads to his fatherly nature, tapping into his guilt for not being able to save his son who had died in a previous war.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

===Lady Liberators===
Some time after the Skrull invasion is defeated the country of Marinmer suffers a devastating earthquake. Because the victims of the earthquake are members of a minority religious group the Marinmer government has confiscated all humanitarian aid packages, and because of Marinmer's strong ties to powerful countries such as China and Russia other nations refuse to intervene for fear of sparking a war. She-Hulk and several members of the [[Lady Liberators]] secretly enter Marinmer intending to steal the confiscated aid packages and distribute them to the earthquake victims.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' Vol.2 #34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Winter Guard]] attempts to stop them but gives up after seeing the plight of the earthquake victims.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' Vol.2 #35&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the US government attempts to arrest She-Hulk for her actions in Marinmer but drops the charges to avoid political embarrassment. With public opinion overwhelmingly in her favor She-Hulk seems poised to get her legal license back when Jazinda is captured by the Behemoth after he mistakenly attacks her, thinking she is the real She-Hulk.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' Vol.2 #36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Jazinda is then taken to a government lab and brutally experimented on when her ability to resurrect herself from the dead is discovered. Jazinda contacts She-Hulk telepathically through a secretly implanted mind reading device and warns her that the government will be coming to question her about their relationship. Jazinda tells She-Hulk to say she didn't know Jazinda was a Skrull and just before going dead/unconscious tells She-Hulk "I've always l...". She-Hulk tries to keep up the denial but when she sees Jazinda about to be vivisected she loses control and breaks Jazinda out. The Behemoth tries to stop her but She-Hulk defeats him with the help of the Lady Liberators. Later it is revealed that Mallory Book, her former boss, was behind all the bad things happening to She-Hulk along with a group called "Fourth Wall". Yet when she saw She-Hulk risk herself to save her Skrull friend Book "canceled" the plan.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' Vol.2 #38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark Reign===
In the 4-Part issue "All-New Savage She-Hulk", Jennifer fights [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]], the alternate reality daughter of Hulk and Thundra after she comes to the Earth-616 reality for the DNA of the strongest man.&lt;ref&gt;''All-New Savage She-Hulk'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; While Jennifer and Lyra were fighting, Sentry tosses her away believing the man Lyra is referring to is him.&lt;ref&gt;''All-New Savage She-Hulk'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; She-Hulk later returns, enraged, and pummels the Sentry into the ground. She then helps Lyra escape from the Avengers Tower.&lt;ref&gt;''All-New Savage She-Hulk'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===M.I.A.===
In ''Incredible Hulk'' #600, Jennifer tasks [[Ben Urich]] to discover the identity of [[Red Hulk|Rulk]]. She informs him that she is unable to as she has asked too many questions to the wrong people. She has Urich bring a photographer (Peter Parker), and meets him along with her insider, Doc Samson, and they venture into a S.H.I.E.L.D. Base that is actually a front for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and General Ross's Gamma Power Super Soldier Program. Leonard Samson then appears to have a breakdown but in reality he is changing into Samson. Samson claims to be stronger and faster (and is larger in size, has longer hair and a lightning-bolt scar) than Jennifer. The clashing duo are subdued by [[MODOK]] and the facility explodes in the aftermath of a fight between Rulk and Hulk; Jennifer, Samson (who has reverted to Leonard) and Rulk are caught in the explosion.

Jennifer's status is unknown and Rulk does not reveal anything to Urich when the two meet a second time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Incredible Hulk'' #600&lt;/ref&gt;

While She-Hulk is M.I.A., the [[Red She-Hulk]] makes her first appearance where she claims Jennifer Walters to be dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' #15–16&lt;/ref&gt;
It was later shown in a flashback that Red She-Hulk prevented Jennifer Walters from escaping from AIM custody. During this battle, Red She-Hulk brutally beat Jennifer and snapped her neck with a cable. In the last panel Jennifer Walters appeared to be dead with the Red She-Hulk standing over her body.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' 606&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Red She-Hulk claims she didn't know her own strength then questions Doc Samson whether it was the real She-Hulk or a Life-Model Decoy to which Samson answers "You're here to follow orders, not to ask questions".&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' 607&lt;/ref&gt; [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]] later infiltrates the Intelligencia, where she finds Jennifer in stasis.&lt;ref&gt;''Fall of the Hulks: The Savage She-Hulks'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Following a brief fight with the [[Red She-Hulk]], the three decide to team up to take down Intelligencia's forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Fall of the Hulks: The Savage She-Hulks'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incredible Hulks===
Following the defeat of Intelligencia, Jennifer begins travelling with her cousin Bruce, [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]], [[Korg (comics)|Korg]], [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and [[Betty Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulks'' #612&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the events of World War Hulks, Skaar becomes aware that his brother [[Hiro-Kala]] is approaching and that he intends to crash the planet K'ai into the Earth. She-Hulk is on the team as they manage to successfully avert disaster. Upon returning to Earth, they find the world in flames as it is in the grasp of the Chaos War. They journey to Hell, where they fight and defeat the Chaos King. Returning to a restored Earth, they are greeted as monsters.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

At some point before or after these events, Jennifer and [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]] settle in New York, where Lyra begins to attend high school in an attempt to gain an understanding of humanity as it occurs in this timeline. As well as helping to integrate Lyra into society, they are also involved in trying to round up the remaining members of the Intelligencia.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

They manage to round up the Intelligencia but the Wizard is able to escape imprisonment and goes after Lyra at her high school prom, almost killing her before She-Hulk intervenes, knocking out Wizard but not before Lyra's secret identity has been compromised. The rest of the pupils turn on Lyra as a result of her prom date being injured and the endangerment of everyone at the dance. She-Hulk explains to her afterwards that they have to leave and that despite being heroes, the life of a Hulk is often lonely.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===Fearsome Four===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, She-Hulk joins with [[Howard the Duck]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], and [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]] to form a four-person team called the Fearsome Four to stop the [[Man-Thing]] from its destructive path. They later discover a plot by [[Psycho-Man]] to use Man-Thing's volatile empathy to create a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;''Fear Itself: Fearsome Four'' #1–4 (Aug. – Nov. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future Foundation===
Prior to a time- and multiverse-spanning trip by the Fantastic Four and family, Thing asks She-Hulk to be a member of the [[Future Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;''FF'' Vol 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doc Green===
When the Hulk is elevated into "Doc Green" – a version of the Hulk possessing Bruce Banner's intellect – after he is treated for a shot to the head as Bruce Banner by use of the [[Extremis (comics)|Extremis]] virus, he sets out to attack and cure other gamma-based mutations. Steve Rogers attempts to order the Hulk to stop before he goes after She-Hulk,&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' vol.3 #14&lt;/ref&gt; but when Doc Green finally confronts her, he instead admits that he has come to recognize that he is coming dangerously close to the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]], as part of him enjoyed eliminating his 'rivals,' having decided instead to accept the eventual loss of his intellect as Extremis wore off rather than risk that persona emerging. Informing She-Hulk that she is the only gamma mutation whose life he felt had been legitimately enhanced by her condition, Doc Green provides her with the last injection of his cure, asking her to use it on him if he goes too far in his efforts to stop an A.I. version of himself that he created and unleashed.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' vol.3 #16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War II===
During the 2016 ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, after the Inhuman [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses]] predicts [[Thanos]]' arrival on Earth, She-Hulk was mortally wounded by a direct attack from the villain in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/08/10/war-machine-didnt-put-she-hulk-in-a-coma-and-other-civil-war-ii-revelations-today/|title=War Machine didn't put She-Hulk in a coma, and other Civil War revelations today|website=bleedingcool.com|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A-Force'' #8 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; When Iron Man learns that they used Ulysses' precognitive power to ambush Thanos, he vows to make sure that no one uses it again. Before She-Hulk goes into cardiac arrest she tells Captain Marvel to fight for the future.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil War II]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hawkeye was acquitted for shooting Bruce Banner, Captain Marvel visited She-Hulk who came out of her coma. When She-Hulk angrily demanded to know the verdict of Hawkeye's trial, Captain Marvel remained silent.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War II'' #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hulk (2016 series)===
Following Bruce Banner's funeral, Jennifer Walters left the superhero business and continued to work as a lawyer where she gained her first client Maise Brewn who was an Inhuman descendant. Due to the stress following the fight with Thanos, Jennifer started turning uncontrollably into her version of the Grey Hulk at different intervals where this form is larger and stronger. Jennifer helped Maise when she was recovering from the trauma and being evicted by her landlord Mr. Tick. When Maise got impatient with Jennifer and summoned a Fear Golem that killed Mr. Tick and some police officers, Jennifer is nearly killed by it and transforms into the Grey She-Hulk. She defeated the Fear Golem and prevented Maise from committing suicide where Maise was arrested for reckless endangerment afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' Vol. 4 #1-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, Jennifer transformed into the Grey She-Hulk inside a construction, where she found [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]]. After changing back, Jennifer told to Hellcat that she is worried over the fact that her grey color could mean that she is like Bruce (since Bruce also had a grey incarnation). Later, Jennifer was watching a live baking video on internet when a baker named Oliver turned into a Hulk-like creature on-camera.&lt;ref&gt;''Hulk'' Vol. 4 #7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gwenpool===

In Gwenpool's first Christmas special Howard the Duck invited her to She-Hulk's Christmas party on the provision that she has not killed any good guys recently. She shows up and karaokes with Ms. Marvel. Also there was a one shot image of her holding mistletoe over her head and inviting She-hulk to kiss her while Ms. Marvel looked on in girlish glee. There were dozens of super humans in attendance proving that whether she is acting as a hero or not She-hulk keeps strong ties to the super community.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

==Personality==
The character's personality has changed over the decades since her first appearance: originally ill-tempered and violent, she is now depicted as a fun-loving, kind, empathetic, yet still feisty woman who frequently uses humor when fighting. She has stated that she does not want to kill her foes, especially ones which she has already subdued.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #27. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also started and led her own disaster relief organization,&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'', Vol.2 #34–35&lt;/ref&gt; and felt great remorse for almost destroying a small town (due to her transformed state briefly turning uncontrollable from radiation), whereupon she helped construction workers to rebuild it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly idealistic lawyer, the character has a history of defending the rights of minorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Solo Avengers |issue=14 |date=1989}}. {{cite comic|title=Fantastic Four versus the X-Men |issue=1 |date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Order |volume=1 |issue=4 |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[civil liberties]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Solo Avengers |issue=14 |date=1989}}. ''World War Hulk: Prelude'' (2006). {{cite comic|title=Incredible Hulk |issue=106 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the right for criminals to not be unduly mistreated and get a proper defense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=3 |issue=9 |date=January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or individuals to not be victimised by certain less ethical corporations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=3 |issue=2 |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also a belief in the necessity of law and order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=4 &amp; 8 |date=January &amp; May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These priorities have sometimes made her personally conflicted, such as [[Registration acts (comics)#1990 Super-human Registration Act|reversing]] her stance regarding the [[Superhuman Registration Act]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Solo Avengers |issue=14 |date=1989}}. {{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=8 |date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being disillusioned when her more famous cousin (whom she considers as a brother)&lt;ref name="SearchforShe-Hulk"&gt;{{cite comic|title=Avengers |volume=3 |issue=75 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shot into space without [[due process]],&lt;ref&gt;''World War Hulk: Prelude'' (2006). {{cite comic|title=Incredible Hulk |issue=106 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when what she thought to be a torturer and murderer of children was cleared from all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=3 |issue=31–33 |date=September–November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, former ''She-Hulk'' writer [[Peter David]] describes her as follows: 

{{quote|She-Hulk has the potential to be our [[Wonder Woman]]. A powerful female with a strong moral center and a determination to do what's right. She's also a unique combination of brains and brawn. The ideal She-Hulk story is one that plays on both aspects of her make-up, the intelligence combined with her strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=116900 Peter David She-Hulk interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618223956/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=116900 |date=2007-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Powers and abilities==
A transfusion of gamma-irradiated blood from her cousin Bruce Banner (the Hulk) granted Jennifer Walters superhuman powers. In her She-Hulk form, she possesses enormous [[superhuman]] strength, that potentially makes her, by far, the physically strongest known woman in the [[Marvel Universe]] when her emotional state is sufficiently high.&lt;ref name="SearchforShe-Hulk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamma Files"&gt;''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' World War Hulk – Gamma Files (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Champion&amp;Herc"&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=2 |issue=8–9 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anger boost"&gt;{{cite comic|title=Solo Avengers |issue=14 |date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although She-Hulk's strength originally remained at a set level and did not increase, later in her history her strength has sporadically been stated to increase further from fear,&lt;ref name="SearchforShe-Hulk"/&gt; or anger,&lt;ref name="Anger boost"/&gt; similar to her cousin. In addition the character possesses superhuman speed, agility, stamina, and reflexes.&lt;ref&gt;''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition'' #6 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

As She-Hulk, Walters is exponentially stronger than she is in her Jennifer Walters form; therefore any extra strength gained as Jennifer Walters through intense physical training will be amplified, making her She-Hulk form even stronger. After being defeated by the [[Champion of the Universe]], She-Hulk exercised for several months in her Jennifer Walters form, resulting in a significant gain in strength and [[muscle|muscular mass]] in her She-Hulk form and allowing her to soundly defeat the Champion in a rematch. At this time she was able to effortlessly sustain the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s maximum weight with a single arm, while her strength was greatly restrained by a "Jupiter suit," and she was shown as considerably stronger than [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].&lt;ref name="Champion&amp;Herc"/&gt; Her calm strength level has since receded, but remains somewhat higher than, for example, [[Wonder Man]].&lt;ref name="Gamma Files"/&gt; Similarly to her cousin, her powers can also greatly increase by absorbing radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Incredible Hulks |issue=635 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Mighty Avengers |issue=9 |date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She-Hulk's body is superhumanly durable and nearly impervious to force, pain, and disease: her skin can withstand extremes of temperature, as well as tremendous stresses and impacts without puncture wounds or lacerations. Her enhanced physiology renders her immune to all terrestrial diseases. She-Hulk also possesses a healing factor, which enabled her to completely recover, within minutes, from a skewering by the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=2 |issue=16 |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Hulk, Jennifer's personality and intelligence are less affected when she transforms into She-Hulk, although she becomes more self-confident and assertive.{{issue|date=June 2018}} In court it was proven that her Gamma Mutant form also has fewer inhibitions as proven during a trial for The Leader; for example, while Jennifer Walters has only had a few sexual partners, reading back a list of She-Hulk's conquests took considerable time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=2 |issue=19 |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, She-Hulk could not revert to her original human form, but that turned out to be psychosomatic due to her not actually wanting to.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

Due to training from the alien Ovoids, She-Hulk is able to swap powers and physiques with other human women, but retains her green skin pigmentation, and only used it once.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational She-Hulk'' #45&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the Hulk's wish, Jennifer can now switch between her human and Hulk forms at will.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulks'' #635&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, thanks to a hex cast by the [[Scarlet Witch]], anyone who wished She-Hulk harm could not recognize her as Jennifer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but harmful side effects forced Jennifer to seek the assistance of [[Doctor Strange]] to remove the hex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=2 |issue=8 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skills===
She-Hulk is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by [[Captain America]] and [[Gamora]]. Even in her Jennifer Walters form, she possesses sufficient skill in the [[martial arts]] to dispatch several would-be muggers much larger than she is. She once displayed sufficient knowledge of [[acupressure]] to render the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] insensate by striking several nerve clusters after first using psychology to distract him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=15 |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character is also a skilled and experienced attorney who attended [[UCLA School of Law]], where she was a member of the [[Order of the Coif]], a national merit society for top legal scholars. She-Hulk had performed legal work as a member of the Magistrati, who had the power to compel her to adjudicate cases anywhere in creation. She ceased to operate in this function after successfully adjudicating the merits of her own Universe to continue existing (opposed by the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]]) before the [[Living Tribunal]].

She is a skilled pilot and has previously used a modified 1995 Dodge automobile equipped with technology enabling flight in Earth's atmosphere and in outer space for limited distances, although it is incapable of interstellar flight.

==Breaking the fourth wall==
[[File:Cover of The Sensational She-Hulk No. 31.png|right|thumb|Cover to ''Sensational She-Hulk'' #31, on which She-Hulk interacts with [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and editor [[Renée Witterstaetter]]]]
For a time, starting with the ''Sensational She-Hulk'' series by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] in 1989, She-Hulk was portrayed with a form of "cross-dimensional" or [[metafiction]]al awareness, to break the [[fourth wall]]. In some stories, she showed an awareness of being a comic book character, with visuals of her "tearing the page" or "walking through a page of advertisements" to reach an enemy's control centre. She sometimes engaged in arguments with the writer ([[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]), or appealed to the comic's editor, [[Renée Witterstaetter]]. ''Sensational She-Hulk'' #50 (Byrne's last issue) involved Renée locking a bound-and-gagged Byrne in a storage closet while she and Jen tried to find the book's new writer. This trend was briefly carried on during her tenure with the [[Heroes for Hire]], when she "spoke" to the book's narrator and "fired" him for losing the plot. Other Marvel characters that have been written to directly "address" the audience include She-Hulk's friend [[Blonde Phantom|Louise Mason]], [[Uatu the Watcher]] (who narrates a majority of the issues of ''What If'' by speaking directly to the reader) and [[Deadpool]]. On occasion, this practice has also been used for [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], [[Wyatt Wingfoot]], and [[Howard the Duck]]. The latest series has not acknowledged this primarily-humor-based quirk of She-Hulk's, save for a coda in Volume 2, #3 (#100), in which Stu Cicero, a law firm "researcher" asks Jen if she can "really do stuff like that." She somewhat wistfully replies "No. I can't" – however, the panel is drawn at a somewhat ambiguous angle that suggests She-Hulk may be looking "out" of the comic, at the reader. She-Hulk's most recent profile in the [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] continues to list this "ability" of hers, and confirms that she is simply downplaying it for the benefit of those around her.&lt;ref name="Gamma Files"/&gt;

The Dan Slott series took a different approach to the [[metafiction]] angle, making use of a concept dating back to Lee and Kirby's early ''Fantastic Four'' – that the heroes of the Marvel Universe permit licensed comic-book adaptations of their adventures to be published. Since all comics published before 2001 bear the seal of the [[Comics Code Authority]] of America (a federal agency in the Marvel Universe), they are considered legal documents admissible as evidence in the superhuman law cases on which She-Hulk works.

If She-Hulk defeats [[Deadpool]] as the final opponent in ''[[Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', she will say "You know, if this game were made in 1991, I'd be the one whacking YOU with a health bar." This references Deadpool's Fourth Wall-breaking hyper move, where he  attacks the opponent with his own life bar, as well as the character's rise in popularity in recent years. In the game's update ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3]]'', if Deadpool is her first opponent, before the match starts she will claim that she can break the fourth wall as well. If she defeats him as her last opponent She-Hulk will threaten to beat him in ''Marvel vs Capcom 4'' if the game is ever made.

==Relationships==
She-Hulk's relationships with men have been defined by her dual needs for independence and acceptance. These needs were evident in her often-tempestuous relationship with her father, Sheriff Morris Walters. A widower whose wife had been killed by mobsters, Walters was overprotective, controlling, and judgmental. In response, Jennifer sought independence from her father, while also desiring his acceptance.

Sheriff Walters felt that the best way for Jennifer to live was for her to follow his values. However, Jennifer grew up perceiving the gray areas of law enforcement (for example, she interpreted the events leading up to riots which occurred during her childhood differently from her father). Although Jennifer saw her decision to become a criminal defense attorney as a kind of homage to her father, Sheriff Walters instead interpreted her choice (to defend criminals) as a rejection of his values.

Jennifer worked at nurturing a supportive relationship with her father, and remained close to a childhood friend, Zapper, with whom she ultimately became romantically involved. Being She-Hulk allowed Jennifer to express emotions which she was not otherwise comfortable revealing. For example, although Jennifer Walters was restrained from dating a younger man, as She-Hulk she felt free to express her affection for Zapper. During that same time, Jennifer pursued a problematic relationship with the affable ne'er-do-well [[Richard Rory]] (a supporting character created by [[Steve Gerber]] for [[Man-Thing]] stories), who actually valued her for who she really was.

Ultimately, She-Hulk's relationship with Zapper fell apart, primarily due to her insistence on permanently remaining in her She-Hulk form, eschewing the Jennifer Walters persona that Zapper had grown up with. Zapper believed that Jennifer's preference represented a rejection of the character's true self. Although in actuality She-Hulk liberated much of Jennifer Walters' repressed personality, the She-Hulk persona also repressed certain aspects of Jennifer Walters' personality which She-Hulk found distasteful.

During her time as an Avenger, She-Hulk engaged in a relationship with [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Avengers |issue=234 |date=August 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this encounter was later retold in flashback,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=7 |date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in that storyline, Starfox was on trial, charged with sexually assaulting a married woman. The alleged victim testified that Starfox's euphoria power had forced her to be sexually forward, similarly to She-Hulk's own encounter with Starfox. Jennifer assumed that her interaction with Starfox had not been consensual after hearing this testimony, but she later discovered that he had not used his powers on her.

She-Hulk was briefly engaged to the younger [[Wyatt Wingfoot]], whom she first met during her tenure with the Fantastic Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Fantastic Four |issue=269 |date=August 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; She let her guard down with Wyatt, expressing her vulnerabilities as Wyatt supported her during a series of traumatic events. A paparazzo took photos of her sunbathing topless (but nobody ultimately knew it was She-Hulk due to an unwitting editor 'correcting' her green skin).&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four'' #275&lt;/ref&gt; Later, corrupt agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. forced her to strip naked and be medically examined as a "potential threat like her cousin". This was all filmed for personal arousal purposes, before [[Dum Dum Dugan]] put a stop to the harassment.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #18&lt;/ref&gt; Although She-Hulk put forward a brave exterior during those incidents, she was actually quite shaken and appreciated Wyatt's support.

Although She-Hulk deeply values close emotional ties with family, friends, and lovers, she seldom admits the depth of her need for these attachments. For example, years after her mother died, Jennifer could not move on from the family home. Even when her father moved out, Jennifer would not leave her family memories behind. The Avengers and Fantastic Four became surrogate families for her; she forged strong bonds with them.

She-Hulk was married to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], whom she first met while he was the Man-Wolf in a Microverse adventure in ''Savage She-Hulk''. The two precipitously eloped in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #9&lt;/ref&gt; The two shared an apartment with She-Hulk's colleague, Augustus "Pug" Pugliese, who holds an unspoken (but obvious) crush on her. Pug correctly deduced that both the suddenness of She-Hulk's strengthened feelings for Jameson as well as the pair's marriage were the result of manipulation by Starfox. Due to his efforts to prove this, She-Hulk and John became aware of Pug's crush just as John was forced to become the Man-Wolf once more.

She-Hulk's passion for John has cooled since Starfox's "love zap" was removed. However, John was never zapped, and his deep love for Jennifer Walters has been confirmed (John has stated a preference for She-Hulk in her human form). She-Hulk's reaction to John as the Man-Wolf/Stargod has not been positive. The marriage has been annulled.

She-Hulk had a date with [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] while both were on the Heroes for Hire team. She resisted dating an "ex-con" but after a scuffle with Titania and [[Absorbing Man]] where Cage aided her she reconsidered. The relationship never developed but a friendship between them was formed.

After Jennifer broke up with John Jameson (but before he signed the annulment) she had flings with [[Clay Quartermain]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], and even made a pass at [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Wolverine rebuffs her, saying he has no wish to "chase after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]'s [[wikt:sloppy seconds|sloppy seconds]]." She-Hulk repeatedly vehemently denies sleeping with the Juggernaut (as a wanted criminal who has attempted to murder her cousin), despite the two previously being shown in bed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=Uncanny X-Men |issue=435 |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is revealed that Juggernaut had, in fact, bedded a She-Hulk from an [[Earth-A|alternate universe]].&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #21&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Continuity (fiction)|out of continuity]] [[tongue-in-cheek]] mini-chapter later spoofs this, by jokingly showing the two characters as passionately in love.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #25&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps her longest crush is on [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], about whom she has repeatedly dreamt. However, after fighting demons together, she rebuffs Hercules' advances, seeing him as a muscle-bound oaf. After Hercules jovially smacks her bottom, She-Hulk sends him through a brick wall, and says she will relegate the idea of a relationship with him to fantasy, as she finds the reality disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;''She-Hulk'' vol.2, #25&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, years afterwards they eventually sleep together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|title=She-Hulk |volume=4 |issue=30 |date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She-Hulk has many friends in the superhuman community. Most of whom showed up for her Christmas party in ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool''.{{issue|date=June 2018}} Gwen used mistletoe to invite She-hulk to kiss her, much to Ms. Marvel's delight, but it is unknown if She-Hulk did so.{{issue|date=June 2018}}

==Costumes==
Due to her affiliation with different [[List of superhero teams and groups|supergroups]] over the years, She-Hulk has donned numerous [[costume]]s. She-Hulk's personality has also gone through significant changes: from aggressive and short-tempered to intelligent, free-spirited, and vivacious.

Because of her various outfit changes, no single costume can be considered [[secular icon|iconic]] (compared to [[Superman]]'s blue and red tights, or [[Spider-Man]]'s red and blue costume and [[mask]]). However, She-Hulk is immediately recognizable due to her size, green skin, and long, dark green, almost-black hair.

In her first appearance, She-Hulk was a massive, towering figure, with wild, untamed, waist-length [[hair]]. She wore a ragged white dress or blouse (the dress ripping and tearing as Walters turned into her giant [[alter ego]]). That white garment, which was often only the blouse that Walters had on before her transformation, always covered her upper body and midsection (in the same way that enough of the Incredible Hulk's pants survived to cover him after his transformations). When she was asked about this in an early issue of the second series, Jennifer responded that her clothes carry the label of the [[Comics Code]].

After her ''Savage'' era, She-Hulk wore appropriately sized clothes. For instance, she joined the Avengers and began dressing in a one-piece [[aerobics]] outfit. During the Avengers era, she wore a purple, one-piece [[swimsuit]] with a white belt.

After the first of the Secret Wars, She-Hulk took the place of the Thing and became a full-fledged member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Her costume kept the sleeveless/legless leotard design, incorporating the colors and style of the team's costumes, with a "4" prominently displayed across her chest and white gloves and boots. After leaving the Fantastic Four, she rejoined the Avengers, donning a white one-piece costume with the blue Avengers insignia emblazoned on it.

She-Hulk has then worn a purple and white one-piece [[leotard]], complemented by fingerless gloves. Her hair is long and straight, as opposed to the thick, curly tresses she sported in the past. After the events of World War Hulk, she has added baggy low-rise jeans to this look.

[[File:Siebmacher001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Emblem of the Holy Roman Emperor]]
'''''Siebmachers Wappenbuch''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈziːpmaxɐs ˈvapm̩buːx|lang}}) is a [[roll of arms]] first published in 1605 as two [[heraldry|heraldic]] multivolume book series of armorial bearings or [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of the [[nobility]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], as well as coats of arms of [[city state]]s and some [[Burgher arms|burgher families]]. Founded and compiled by '''Johann Ambrosius Siebmacher''' (1561 – 23 March 1611), a German [[Heraldry|heraldic artist]], [[Engraving|copperplate engraver]], [[Etching|etcher]] and [[Publishing|publisher]] from [[Nuremberg]], his works became an important source of heraldry of the German-speaking regions.

[[File:Siebmacher007.jpg|thumb|Page extract from ''Neuer Siebmacher'', illustrating the coat-of-arms of ducal families]]
;The Old Siebmacher
The ''Alter Siebmacher'' was compiled 1605–1806, and represents the contemporary heraldry during the [[Early Modern Germany|final two centuries]] of the Holy Roman Empire. 
Its two volumes were completed by Johann Sibmacher. His work was continued to six volumes with additional supplements by Paul Fürst, Wolfgang Gottlieb Fürst, Rudolf Johann Helmers, [[Christoph Weigel the Elder]] and Gabriel Nikolaus Raspe. The supplemented works were also published under the titles of their respective publishers, such as: ''Fürstsches Wappenbuch'', ''Helmersches Wappenbuch'', ''Weigelsches Wappenbuch'' or ''Raspes Wappenbuch''.

;The New Siebmacher 
The ''Neuer Siebmacher'', ''Siebmachers großes und allgemeines Wappenbuch'' was compiled 1854-1967 &lt;!-- 113 years? Is that a typo? --&gt; by [[Adolf Matthias Hildebrandt]], [[Maximilian Gritzner]], and Gustav A Seyler. The ''General-Index'' of the whole work has been edited by Hanns Jäger-Sunstenau. 
Later [[Ottfried Neubecker]] had published all burgher arms of the New Siebmacher without the text as a sort of illustrated glossary organized by the heraldic charges.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1975–1979) ===
Gordy started wrestling in 1975 at the age of 14 as '''Terry Mecca''' for the [[International Wrestling Association (1970s)|International Wrestling Association]]. In early 1979, he began wrestling under his real name and formed [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] with [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]].&lt;ref name=TagBook&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | chapter= Top 20: 7 The Fabulous Freebirds | pages= 46–52 | year=2005| isbn=978-1-5502-2683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dale Hey|Buddy Roberts]] was later added to the group.

=== Memphis CWA Wrestling and Mid South Wrestling (1979–1985) ===
The Freebirds came to Memphis the first time in 1979 and feuded mainly with [[Jerry Lawler]] &amp; [[Bill Dundee]]. When in mid South Wrestling, he formed [[The Fabulous Freebirds]] as the suggestion by [[Bill Watts]] with [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]] and [[Buddy Roberts]]. They returned in 1984 to feud with Lawler &amp; Austin Idol and later with Lawler &amp; Phil Hickerson.

===Universal Wrestling Federation (1986)===
In 1986, when the Freebirds were in the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], the former Mid South Wrestling, Gordy won the [[UWF Heavyweight Championship]] 
title and held it for six months, before losing it via forfeit to [[One Man Gang|The One Man Gang]], after an angle the same night in which Gordy was injured by [["Dr. Death" Steve Williams]].&lt;ref name=TagBook/&gt; During this time, Gordy and the Freebirds had an ongoing feud with the UWF fan favorite [[Hacksaw Jim Duggan]], in which Duggan and Gordy frequently squared off, usually ending in a disqualification because of outside interference.&lt;ref name=TagBook/&gt;

=== World Class Championship Wrestling (1982–1988) ===
In 1982, the Freebirds went to [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] and had a heated and memorable feud with the Von Erichs ([[David Von Erich|David]], [[Kevin Von Erich|Kevin]], [[Kerry Von Erich|Kerry]] and [[Mike Von Erich|Mike]]) that was famously kicked off when Gordy slammed the Cage door on Kerry during his Cage Match at [[WCCW Star Wars (1982)]] against [[Ric Flair]] where [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael Hayes]] was the special guest [[Referee]] inciting a riot among fans attending. They traded the six man title back and forth a few times over the years.&lt;ref name=TagBook/&gt; Gordy was also at one time one half of the WCCW American Tag Team champions.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1987–1994) ===
Gordy teamed with Stan Hansen beginning in 1987 in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]. Gordy later teamed with Steve Williams as [[The Miracle Violence Connection]].&lt;ref name=TagBookMVC&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | chapter= The National Era (Mid-1980s to present): The Miracle Violence Combination | pages= 284–285 | year=2005| isbn=978-1-5502-2683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time there, he also held the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] on two occasions.&lt;ref name=TagBookMVC/&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation (1984) ===
The Freebirds spent a very brief time in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1984, but left after management suggested splitting them up.&lt;ref name=WWF6389Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 1: WWF 1963 – 1989  | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2013 | isbn=1492825972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jim Crockett Promotions/NWA World Championship Wrestling (1987, 1989, 1992) ===
The Freebirds spent some time in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]'s [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] where they split to feud briefly, but later reunited.&lt;ref name=WCW8388Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 3:Jim Crockett and the NWA World Title 1983–1989  | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2013 |isbn=149480347X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Gordy helped Hayes to reform the Freebirds, with [[Jimmy Garvin]], in Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), which became [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=TagBook/&gt;&lt;ref name=WCW8994Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 4: World Championship Wrestling 1989–1994  | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2014 | isbn=1499656343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he alongside of Dr. Death Steve Williams defeated the Steiners to become World Tag Team Champions.&lt;ref name=WCWTag/&gt;

Gordy and Williams returned to [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1992 and won the WCW World Tag Team titles.&lt;ref name=TagBookMVC/&gt;&lt;ref name=WCWTag/&gt; They also won the NWA World Tag Team titles in a tournament at the Great American Bash card in [[Albany, Georgia]], one week later, and unified the titles.&lt;ref name=TagBookMVC/&gt; Their feud with [[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner]]; in Japan, this was hyped as a feud between the best foreign teams of the two top Japanese promotions (the Steiners were competing for rival [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] at the time).&lt;ref name=TagBookMVC/&gt; Despite advances by New Japan, Gordy and Williams, out of loyalty to the AJPW founder and promoter, [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]], refused to compete for the promotion (which had business ties with WCW at the time), leading to Gordy's departure from WCW before Halloween Havoc and Williams' departure after Starrcade.&lt;ref name=TagBookMVC/&gt;

In 1993 Gordy, while traveling from the United States to Japan for a tour, took an overdose of pain medication and slipped into a coma, ultimately suffering permanent brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick (1999). ''[[Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks]]''. [[ReganBooks]]. {{ISBN|0-06-039299-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to action later that year, but never received a shot at the Triple Crown again.  In 1994, Gordy had a small reunion with Hayes and Garvin as the Freebirds in the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] where he and Garvin won the GWF Tag Team titles.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996) ===
In 1996, Gordy showed up in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] to challenge [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] for the ECW World Heavyweight title, as the "internationally recognized #1 contender". He had been working for the [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]] promotion in Japan, wrestling [[Hardcore wrestling|deathmatches]]. He lost, but went on to team up with [[Tommy Dreamer]] and later to reunite with "Dr. Death" Steve Williams to wrestle [[The Eliminators]]. He also wrestled [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] in what was  the second ever "Battle Of The Bam Bams"(The first one happened on a Windy City Wrestling show). Gordy lost the match because of outside interference from The Eliminators.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1996–1997) ===
Gordy had a brief run in the WWF as '''The Executioner''' in 1996 and 1997. He teamed up with [[Mick Foley|Mankind]], both managed by [[Paul Bearer]], and feuded with [[The Undertaker]]. The Executioner came to the ring under a mask and carrying an axe.&lt;ref name=WWF9099Book&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Cawthon | title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 2: WWF 1990 – 1999  | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | year= 2013 | asin=B00RWUNSRS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his TV debut at the [[In Your House]] pay-per-view, ''[[In Your House 11: Buried Alive|Buried Alive]]'', where he interfered in The Undertaker's Buried Alive match with Mankind, hitting him with a shovel and burying him with the help of several other wrestlers.&lt;ref name=WWF9099Book/&gt; However, at ''[[In Your House 12: It's Time]]'', The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an Armageddon Rules match, and Gordy left the promotion shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1990s.html#12 | title=It's Time | date= December 15, 1996 | accessdate=June 17, 2015 | publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final televised appearance was on the January 12, 1997 episode of [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|''WWF Superstars'']], where he lost to [[Goldust]], after which Paul Bearer turned on him by hitting him with his urn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehistoryofwwe.com/96.htm | title=WWF 1996 | accessdate=December 7, 2016| publisher=The History of WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bruce Prichard on Something to Wrestle With (ep 41) The Executioner gimmick was because McMahon was not high on Gordy at the time and there were doubts that he could still compete. The Executioner's use of a mask was intended to protect Gordy so that if he could not prove himself then audiences would not know it was Gordy, and thus his legacy would not be tainted. Had Gordy been able to compete at a high level then there would have been the opportunity later for Gordy to unmask. It was mentioned that the hiring was mostly done as a favor for Michael Hayes. As part of the story, [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] and [[Paul Bearer]] were traveling to [[Japan]] in the month of September to locate The Executioner [[temperate rainforests|in the Rainforest]] as their "hitman" to take out [[The Undertaker]]

== Personal life ==
Gordy left behind 2 young daughters, Amber and Miranda Gordy, and a son, [[Ray Gordy]]. Ray Gordy wrestled for WWE as "Jesse" and "Slam Master J" before being released in 2010. His nephew is [[Richard Acelinger]], who competed for [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] as Richard Slinger.

== Death ==
Gordy died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused by a [[thrombus|blood clot]] on July 16, 2001. He was 40.

In 2014, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame]]. A year later, he was also posthumously inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]].

On April 2, 2016, Gordy was posthumously inducted by his son into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as part of [[The Fabulous Freebirds]].

[[Image:Webb Gallery, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Webb Gallery&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Webb Gallery''' is an exhibit building located at the [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. Webb Gallery is the Museum's primary showcase for American art and serves as a gallery for special exhibitions.

==History==
The [[Shelburne Museum]] constructed '''Webb Gallery''' in 1960 and designed the building to mimic the facades of its neighboring historic structures. Webb Gallery’s footprint, with a central gable and two flanking wings, echoes the symmetry and scale of adjacent [[The Dorset House]], while the red brick exterior, reflects the texture and color of nearby [[Vergennes Schoolhouse]] and [[The Charlotte Meeting House]]. Despite the historic references, behind the old-fashioned façade '''Webb Gallery''' possesses a modern truss-roof and technological systems that provide the proper environment for the preservation of artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
===American Paintings===
Shelburne's extensive collection of 19th-century American paintings features [[Hudson River School]] landscapes, [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminist]] [[seascapes]], portraits, still lifes, and genre scenes. Artists include [[Thomas Cole]], [[John Kensett]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Martin Johnson Heade]], [[Fitz Hugh Lane]], [[John Singleton Copley]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[John Peto]], [[Winslow Homer]], [[Eastman Johnson]], and [[John Quidor]].&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"&gt;[http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=6] {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

20th-century paintings include work by [[Grandma Moses]], [[Carl Rungius]], and [[Andrew Wyeth]]. Wyeth's ''Soaring'' is on view in Webb Gallery.&lt;ref name="shelburnemuseum.org"/&gt;
