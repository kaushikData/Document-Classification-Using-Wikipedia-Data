'''The Algatron''' was a proposed and prototyped waste filtration and recycling system to be implemented on [[NASA]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munns|first1=David|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed and built by a pair of sanitary engineers at the [[University of California, Berkley]] [[William J. Oswald]] and [[Clarence Golueke]], the Algatron relied on algae to provide carbon Dioxide absorption and oxygen generation as well as "microbiological waste conversion" for "humans sealed within an isolated capsule.".&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, Golueke, and Horning, "Closed Ecological Systems," 45&lt;/ref&gt; A working model was built by Oswald and Golueke in 1965 or 1966 under a contract by from the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid,. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of two stacked cylinders lined with Algae, the cylinders would spin in opposite directions. With ports to allow sunlight in, nutrients (the waste and urine) were introduced via some overflow mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Algatron|url=http://www.worldoftrons.com/blog/2017/2/21/algatron|website=World of Trons|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the promise that the Algatron represented, and the ways in which Oswald and Golueke "understood that the closed environment of the space capsule was itself just the a microcosm of the closed system of the earth's biosphere," the technology would never get past the prototype stage. NASA instead decided to go with fecal bags to deal with waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munns|first1=David|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians developed a similar system, the BIOS-3, which got as far enough as a successful test run with human occupants in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors''' ('''ALEXIS''') [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] [[telescope]]s feature curved mirrors whose multilayer coatings reflect and focus low-energy [[X-ray]]s or extreme [[ultraviolet]] light the way [[optical telescope]]s focus visible light. The satellite and payloads were funded by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and built by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in collaboration with [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and the [[University of California]]-Space Sciences Lab. The satellite bus was built by AeroAstro, Inc. of Herndon, VA.  The Launch was provided by the [[United States Air Force]] Space Test Program on a [[Pegasus rocket|Pegasus]] Booster on April 25, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ALEXIS satellite marks fifth anniversary of launch|url=http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/masint/98-062.html|accessdate=17 August 2011|newspaper=Los Alamos National Laboratory|date=23 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission is entirely controlled from a small groundstation at LANL.

==Features==
ALEXIS scans half the sky with its three paired sets of EUV telescopes, although it cannot locate any events with high resolution. Ground-based optical astronomers can look for visual counterparts to the EUV transients seen by ALEXIS by comparing observations made at two different times. Large telescopes, with their small fields of view, cannot quickly scan a large enough piece of the sky to effectively observe transients seen by ALEXIS, but amateur equipment is well suited to the task. Participants in the ALEXIS project comb the ALEXIS data for the coordinates of a likely current transient, then train their telescopes and observe the area.

There are six EUV telescopes which are arranged in three co-aligned pairs which cover three overlapping 33° fields-of-view. At each rotation of the satellite, ALEXIS monitors the entire anti-solar hemisphere. Each telescope consists of a spherical mirror with a Mo-Si layered synthetic microstructure (LSM) or Multilayer coating, a curved profile microchannel plate detector located at the telescope's prime focus, a UV background-rejecting filter, electron rejecting magnets at the telescope aperture, and image processing readout electronics. The geometric collecting area of each telescope is about 25 cm2, with spherical aberration limiting resolution to about 0.25°s. Analysis of the pre-flight x-ray throughput calibration data indicates that the peak on-axis effective collecting area for each telescope's response function ranges from 0.25 to 0.05 cm2. The peak area-solid angle product response function of each telescope ranges from 0.04 to 0.015 cm2-sr.

The spacing of the molybdenum and silicon layers on each telescope's mirror is the primary determinant of the telescope's photon energy response function. The ALEXIS multilayer mirrors also employ a "wavetrap" feature to significantly reduce the mirror's reflectance for He II 304 Angstrom geocoronal radiation which can be a significant background source for space borne EUV telescopes. These mirrors, produced by Ovonyx, Inc., are highly curved yet have been shown to have very uniform multilayer coatings and hence have very uniform EUV reflecting properties over their entire surfaces. The efforts in designing, producing and calibrating the ALEXIS telescope mirrors have been previously described in Smith et al., 1990.

ALEXIS weighs 100 pounds, uses 45 watts, and produces 10 kilobits/second of data. Position and time of arrival are recorded for each detected photon. ALEXIS will always be in a survey-monitor mode, with no individual source pointings. It is suited for simultaneous observations with ground-based observers who prefer to observe sources at opposition. Coordinated observations need not be arranged before the fact, because most sources in the anti-Sun hemisphere will be observed and archived. ALEXIS is tracked from a single ground station in Los Alamos. Between ground station passes, data are stored in an on-board solid state memory of 78 Megabytes. ALEXIS, with its wide fields-of-view and well-defined wavelength bands, complements the scanners on NASA's Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) and the ROSAT EUV Wide Field Camera (WFC), which are sensitive, narrow field-of-view, broad-band survey experiments. ALEXIS's results will also highly complement the data from EUVE's spectroscopy instrument.

ALEXIS's scientific goals are to:

*Map the diffuse background in three emission line bands with the highest angular resolution to date,
*Perform a narrow-band survey of point sources,
*Search for transient phenomena in the ultrasoft X-ray band, and
*Provide synoptic monitoring of variable ultrasoft X-ray sources such as cataclysmic variables and flare stars.

==End of mission==
In 2005, after 13 years in orbit, the ALEXIS satellite reached the end of its mission.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

'''Artificial intuition''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] capacity of an [[artificial]] software to function similarly to human [[consciousness]], specifically in the capacity of human consciousness known as [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]]. 

==Comparison of human and the theoretically artificial ==
Intuition is the function of the mind, the experience of which, is described as knowledge based on "a hunch", resulting (as the word itself does) from "contemplation" or "insight". &lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cVnNIB89_nIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBiMPq2sLdAhUIgVwKHYWqALAQ6AEIRDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false Inside Intuition] - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cVnNIB89_nIC p.3] Routledge, 6 Aug 2012 {{ISBN|1134121830}} Accessed 17th September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/intuition etymonline] Accessed 17th September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Jean Piaget]] showed that intuitive functioning within the normally developing human child at the ''Intuitive Thought Substage''  of the [[preoperational stage]] occurred at from four to seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour, Richard Gross  {{ISBN|978-1-4441-0831-6}}  see: [[Jean Piaget]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, John W. (2004). Life-Span Development (9th Ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill College - Chapter 8  ''from'' [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Carl Jung's concept of [[synchronicity]], the concept of "intuitive intelligence" is described as something like a capacity that transcends ordinary-level functioning to a point where information is understood with a greater depth than is available in more simple rationally-thinking entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?qt=wikipedia&amp;q=isbn%3A0670032921 worldcat] retrieved 11:03(GMT) 26.10.201&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/synchronicity  ''Farlex''] retrieved 11:08(GMT) 26.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung 1921"&gt;Jung, C.G.

Artificial intuition is theoretically (or otherwise) a sophisticated function of an artifice that is able to interpret data with depth and locate hidden factors functioning in  [[Gestalt psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487002002076 Herbert Simon.

Simon]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gestalt psychology'': [[Christian von Ehrenfels]], [[Kurt Koffka]] &amp;  [[Wolfgang Köhler]]&lt;/ref&gt; and that intuition in the artificial mind would, in the context described here, be a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up process]] upon a macroscopic scale identifying something like the [[archetypal]]&lt;ref name="Jung 1921"/&gt; (see [[Wikt:τύπος|τύπος]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%2Fpos Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon] retrieved 11:21(UTC) 27.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;).

To create artificial intuition supposes the possibility of the re-creation of a higher functioning of the human mind, with capabilities such as what might be found in [[semantic memory]] and learning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2WNIDwnKlDwC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;lpg=PA433&amp;dq=artificial+intuition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E-RCAO2jIZ&amp;sig=njxFJC5_vMLab6gfT742PSBQpck&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tPymTue9IMWY8QOpy-DTDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=artificial%20intuition&amp;f=false Fuzzy Information and Engineering Volume 1 Chapter titled ''Crime pattern study and fuzzy Information Analysis'' (Springer, 2008)] By Bing-Yuan Cao 19:17(GMT) 25.10.2011  ''see also'':[[Fuzzy logic]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://monicasmind.com/?page_id=2 Monica Anderson (research company website)] retrieved 12:23(GMT) 26.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goonth.posterous.com/?tag=artificialintuition website by Gunther Sonnenfeld] retrieved 19:36(GMT) 25.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The transferral of the functioning of a biological system to synthetic functioning is based upon modeling of functioning from knowledge of [[cognition]] and  the [[brain]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sulcus.berkeley.edu/FLM/SH/MDL/GAL/GalDisChapts/galdis.chapter1.html sulcus.berkeley.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331051928/http://sulcus.berkeley.edu/FLM/SH/MDL/GAL/GalDisChapts/galdis.chapter1.html |date=March 31, 2012 }} retrieved 20:57(GMT) 25.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itp.edu/about/carl_jung.php ITP] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025135704/http://www.itp.edu/about/carl_jung.php |date=October 25, 2011 }} retrieved 20:52(GMT) 25.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt; for instance as applications of models of [[artificial neural network]]s from the research done within the discipline of [[computational neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Eric (1990).

==In fiction==
[[Artificial intelligence in fiction]] often crosses the line to apparent artificial intuition, although it can't be shown if the intent of the fiction creator was to show a simulation of intuition or that real artificial intuition is part of the story's AI, because this depends on the internal structure of the programming of the AI, which is not usually shown in stories.

{{Atmospheric sciences}}
{{Weather}}
'''Atmospheric sciences''' are the study of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], its processes, the effects other systems have on the atmosphere, and the effects of the atmosphere on these other systems. [[Meteorology]] includes [[atmospheric chemistry]] and [[atmospheric physics]] with a major focus on [[weather forecasting]]. [[Climatology]] is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time, due to both natural and anthropogenic [[climate change|climate variability]]. [[Aeronomy]] is the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere, where [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] are important. Atmospheric science has been extended to the field of [[planetary science]] and the study of the atmospheres of the [[planet]]s of the [[solar system]].

Experimental instruments used in atmospheric sciences include [[satellite]]s, [[rocketsonde]]s, [[radiosonde]]s, [[weather balloon]]s, and [[laser]]s.

The term '''aerology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀήρ, ''aēr'', "[[air]]"; and -λογία, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is sometimes used as an alternative term for the study of Earth's atmosphere. Early pioneers in the field include [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] and [[Richard Assmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OlckxY7BA_0C&amp;pg=PA17 Ultraviolet radiation in the solar system] By Manuel Vázquez, Arnold Hanslmeier&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atmospheric chemistry ==

[[File:Atmosphere composition diagram-en.svg|left|thumb|250px]]
{{main|Atmospheric chemistry}}
Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets is studied. It is a multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as climatology.

The composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere has been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain, photochemical smog and global warming. Atmospheric chemistry seeks to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.

== Atmospheric dynamics ==
{{see also|Synoptic scale meteorology}}
Atmospheric dynamics involves the study of observations and theory dealing with all motion systems of meteorological importance. Common topics studied include diverse phenomena such as [[thunderstorms]], [[tornado]]es, [[gravity wave]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[extratropical cyclone]]s, [[jet stream]]s, and global-scale circulations. The goal of dynamical studies is to explain the observed circulations on the basis of fundamental principles from [[physics]]. The objectives of such studies incorporate improving [[weather forecasting]], developing methods for predicting seasonal and interannual climate fluctuations, and understanding the implications of human-induced perturbations (e.g., increased carbon dioxide concentrations or depletion of the ozone layer) on the global climate.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Washington]].

== Atmospheric physics ==
{{main|Atmospheric physics}}
Atmospheric physics is the application of physics to the study of the atmosphere. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model Earth's atmosphere and the atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations, chemical models, radiation balancing, and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere and underlying oceans. In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of scattering theory, [[wave propagation]] models, [[cloud physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and spatial [[statistics]], each of which incorporate high levels of mathematics and physics. Atmospheric physics has close links to meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including remote sensing instruments.

In the United Kingdom, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the Meteorological Office. Divisions of the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) oversee research projects and weather modeling involving atmospheric physics. The [[U.S. National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center]] also carries out studies of the high atmosphere.

The [[Earth's magnetic field]] and the [[solar wind]] interact with the atmosphere, creating the [[ionosphere]], [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, [[telluric current]]s, and [[radiant energy]].

== Climatology ==

[[File:El_Nino_regional_impacts.png|thumb|250px|Regional impacts of warm ENSO episodes (El Niño).]]
{{main|Climatology}}
In contrast to [[meteorology]], which studies short term [[weather]] systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. [[List of climate scientists|Climatologists]], those who practice climatology, study both the nature of climates&amp;nbsp;– local, regional or global&amp;nbsp;– and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help [[prediction|predict]] future [[climate change]].

Phenomena of climatological interest include the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], [[atmospheric circulation|circulation patterns]], [[heat transfer]] ([[thermal radiation|radiative]], [[convection|convective]] and [[latent heat flux|latent]]), interactions between the atmosphere and the [[oceans]] and [[Landform|land]] surface (particularly [[vegetation]], [[land use]] and [[topography]]), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere. Related disciplines include [[astrophysics]], [[atmospheric physics]], [[chemistry]], [[ecology]], [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[glaciology]], [[hydrology]], [[oceanography]], and [[volcanology]].

== Atmospheres on other celestial bodies ==

[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Earth's atmosphere]]
All of the Solar System's planets have atmospheres.  This is because their gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface.  Larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] close by, while the smaller planets lose these gases into [[space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sheppard |first1=S.

There is a thin atmosphere on [[Atmosphere of Triton|Triton]], and a trace of an atmosphere on the [[Atmosphere of the Moon|Moon]].

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying degrees of energy received from either the Sun or their interiors, leading to the formation of dynamic [[weather system]]s such as [[hurricane]]s, (on Earth), planet-wide [[dust storm]]s ([[Climate of Mars|on Mars]]), an Earth-sized [[Anticyclonic storm|anticyclone]] on Jupiter (called the [[Great Red Spot]]), and [[Great Dark Spot|holes in the atmosphere]] (on Neptune).&lt;ref name=Weather&gt;{{cite web |last=Harvey |first=Samantha |date=1 May 2006 |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere? |publisher=NASA |accessdate=9 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808201459/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |archivedate=8 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one extrasolar planet, [[HD 189733 b]], has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.&lt;ref name="knutson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knutson |first=Heather A. |author2=Charbonneau, David |author3=Allen, Lori E. |author4=Fortney, Jonathan J. |title=A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b |journal=Nature |year=2007 |volume=447 |pages=183–6 |doi=10.1038/nature05782 |pmid=17495920 |issue=7141 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..183K |arxiv=0705.0993}} (Related [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/2007/pr200713.html press release])&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Atomic Energy Research Establishment''', known as '''AERE''' or colloquially '''Harwell Laboratory''', near [[Harwell, Oxfordshire]], was the main [[Headquarters|centre]] for [[nuclear power|atomic energy]] [[research and development]] in the [[United Kingdom]] from the 1940s to the 1990s.

==Founding==
In 1945 [[John Cockcroft]] was asked to set up a research laboratory to further the use of [[nuclear fission]] for both [[military]] purposes and generating energy. The criteria for selection involved finding somewhere remote with a good water supply, but within reach of good transport links and a university with a [[nuclear physics]] laboratory. This more or less limited the choice to the areas around [[Oxford]] or [[Cambridge]]. It had been decided that an RAF airfield would be chosen, the aircraft hangars being ideal to house the large atomic piles that would need to be built. Although Cambridge University had the better [[nuclear physics]] facility (the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]), the RAF did not want to abandon any of its eastern airfields because of its potential involvement in the [[Cold War]], therefore Harwell was chosen when the RAF made the airfield available. [[RAF Harwell]] was sixteen miles south of [[Oxford]] near [[Didcot]] and [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]] (at this time in Berkshire), and on 1 January 1946 the Atomic Energy Research Establishment was formed, coming under the [[Ministry of Supply]]. The scientists mostly took over both accommodations and work buildings from the departing [[Royal Air Force|RAF]].

The early laboratory had several specialist divisions: Chemistry (initially headed by [[Egon Bretscher]], later by Robert Spence), General Physics (H.W.B. Skinner), Nuclear Physics (initially headed by [[Otto Frisch]], later E. Bretscher), Reactor Physics (John Dunworth), Theoretical Physics ([[Klaus Fuchs]], later [[Brian Flowers]] and [[Walter_Marshall,_Baron_Marshall_of_Goring|Walter Marshall]], Isotopes (Henry Seligmann), Engineering (Harold Tongue, later Robert Jackson), Chemical Engineering (A.S. White), and Metallurgy (Bruce Chalmers, later [[Monty Finniston]], FRS). Finniston was later to become chairman of the British Steel Corporation. Directors after Cockcroft included [[Basil Schonland]], Sir [[Arthur Vick]] and [[Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring|Walter Marshall]].

[[File:Aere harwell main gate.jpg|thumb|AERE main gate]]
The decision to site AERE at Harwell had huge implications for a rural area which had depended mainly on agriculture for employment before World War II. The site (which quickly became known colloquially amongst the local population as 'The Atomic') became one of the main employers in the post-war period. It also led to an influx of labour from outside the area, putting pressure on already scarce housing stocks. In response to the problem, hostels and temporary housing were established around the site. The hostels were named Icknield Way House ('B' mess, the RAF sergeants' mess), Portway House ('C' Mess, the RAF airmans' mess) and Ridgeway House ('A' Mess, the officers' mess) provided either single or double room accommodation for staff and were adopted from existing RAF structures on the site. The class distinction was maintained by the UKAEA. A-Mess housed visiting scientists, B-Mess scientific support staff and some post-graduate scientists, and C-Mess industrial support staff. The temporary housing stock consisted of several hundred '[[Prefabricated building|Prefabs]]', single storey structures manufactured in parts for quick erection, which were designed originally to help alleviate chronic housing shortages in the immediate post-war period in Britain. Two estates of 'Prefabs' were built to the north and south of the site perimeter, along with a road system and parade of shops. In later years, conventional housing was provided on estates built in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Grove, Oxfordshire|Grove]] (near [[Wantage]]) and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] for employees. A modern hostel (Rush Common House) was built in Abingdon. The houses were later sold (mainly to their occupants) in the 1980s and the hostels were demolished or adapted for other uses. The 'Prefab' estates lasted until the early 1990s when the residents were transferred to local authority housing. The RAF prewar NCO married quarter housing at Harwell together other UKAEA housing in Abingdon, Grove, Wantage and Newbury totaling 129 houses were sold in their entirety to the Welbeck Estate Group in 1995 and following extensive refurbishment were sold to local buyers.

Workers were bussed to the site from as far away as Reading in utilitarian grey buses marked 'AERE'.

==Early reactors==
{{main|DIDO (nuclear reactor)|GLEEP|PLUTO reactor}}
Such was the interest in nuclear power and the priority devoted to it in those days that the first reactor, [[GLEEP]], was operating by 15 August 1947. GLEEP (Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile) was a low-power (3 [[kilowatt]]) graphite-moderated air-cooled reactor. The first reactor in Western Europe, it operated until 1990. The engineers at Harwell eventually decided that this small reactor should be put to some use, so the air that flowed over it was directed through an underground trench, where there were some pipes filled with water that connected to a secondary group of water-filled pipes that were used by the nearby establishments to heat offices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Atomic Pile Heat Warms Buildings"] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1952, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

A successor to GLEEP, called [[BEPO]] (British Experimental Pile 0) was constructed based on the experience with GLEEP, and commenced operation in 1948. BEPO was shut down in 1968.

[[LIDO reactor|LIDO]] was an [[enriched uranium]] thermal swimming pool reactor which operated from 1956 to 1972 and was mainly used for shielding and nuclear physics experiments. It was fully dismantled and returned to a green field site in 1995. In the same building as LIDO, DAPHNE (Dido And Pluto Handmaiden for Nuclear Experiments) was constructed to test equipment used in experiments on the two larger reactors.

A pair of larger 26 [[megawatt|MW]] reactors, [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO]] and [[PLUTO reactor|PLUTO]], which used enriched [[uranium]] with a [[heavy water]] [[neutron moderator|moderator]] came online in 1956 and 1957 respectively. These reactors were used primarily for testing the behaviour of different materials under intense [[neutron]] irradiation to help decide what materials to build reactor components out of.   A sample could be irradiated for a few months to simulate the radiation dose that it would receive over the lifetime of a power reactor. Both reactors were also used for neutron scattering crystallography. They took over commercial [[isotope]] production from BEPO after that was shut down.  DIDO and PLUTO themselves were shut down in 1990 and the fuel, moderator and some ancillary buildings removed.  The GLEEP reactor and the hangar it was situated in were decommissioned 2005. The current plans are to decommission the BEPO, DIDO and PLUTO reactors by 2020.

==Zeta==
One of the most significant experiments to occur at AERE was the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] [[fusion power]] experiment. An early attempt to build a large-scale nuclear fusion reactor, the project was started in 1954, and the first successes were achieved in 1957. In 1968 the project was shut down, as it was believed that no further progress could be made with the kind of design that ZETA represented (see [[Timeline of nuclear fusion]]).

==Organisational history==
In 1954 AERE was incorporated into the newly formed [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA). Harwell and other laboratories were to assume responsibility for atomic energy research and development. It was part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI).

During the 1970s the slowdown of the British nuclear energy program resulted in a greatly reduced demand for the kind of work being done by the UKAEA. Pressures on government spending also reduced the funding available. Reluctant to merely disband a quality scientific research organisation, UKAEA was required to divert its research effort to the solving of scientific problems for industry by providing paid consultancy or services. For example, an Operations Research Group was set up at Harwell, and developed shipping fleet scheduling software that was used to provide a service to British and overseas shipping companies&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BAIlXPgcsHwC&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;ots=1aT_-RwA1c&amp;dq=%22Route%20program%20sends%20profits%20sailing%20ahead%22&amp;pg=PA268#v=onepage&amp;f=false "Route program sends profits sailing ahead"], New Scientist 3 Feb 1972 p268&lt;/ref&gt; and oil reservoir   simulation software to help in the development of the UK's North Sea oil interests&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aNRaAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=harwell+oil+reservoir+simulator&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Atomic+Energy+Authority+Research "Winning More Oil: Increasing Importance for Enhanced Oil Recovery"] auth. Ray Dafter, pub. Financial Times Business Information Limited, 1981, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;. UKAEA was ordered to operate on a [[Trading Fund]] basis, i.e. to account for itself financially as though it was a private corporation, while remaining fully government owned. After several years of transition, UKAEA was divided in the early 1990s. UKAEA retained ownership of all land and infrastructure and of all nuclear facilities, and of businesses directly related to nuclear power. The remainder was privatised as [[AEA Technology]] and floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. Harwell Laboratory contained elements of both organisations, though the land and infrastructure was owned by UKAEA.

[[File:Aere harwell national chemical landmark.jpg|thumb|right|Harwell Laboratory blue plaque]]
The name Atomic Energy Research Establishment was dropped at the same time, and the site became known as the ''Harwell International Business Centre''. The site incorporates the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] which is home to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (including the [[ISIS neutron source]] and [[Diamond Light Source]]). In 2006, the name [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] was introduced and management of the campus was passed to a Public / Private 50:50 Joint Venture partnership to take forward the management and redevelopment of the campus which has been re-branded as Harwell Oxford. In February 2009, part of the campus, the remaining nuclear licensed site, passed to the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]] and is being decommissioned by Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL, from 2015 part of [[Magnox Ltd]]), on their behalf.

The '''Bielefeld School''' is a group of German historians based originally at [[Bielefeld University]] who promote [[social history]] and [[political history]] using quantification and the methods of [[political science]] and [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lorenz, Chris "Wehler, Hans-Ulrich" pages 1289–1290 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 2 page 1289&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaders include [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Jürgen Kocka]] and [[Reinhart Koselleck]]. Instead of emphasizing the personalities of great historical leaders, as in the conventional approach, it concentrates on socio-cultural developments. History as "historical social science" (as Wehler described it) has mainly been explored in the context of studies of German society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The movement has published the scholarly journal ''{{ill|Geschichte und Gesellschaft: Zeitschrift fur Historische Sozialwissenschaft|de|Geschichte und Gesellschaft}}'' since 1975.

Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s–60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society"—''Gesellschaftsgeschichte''—has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by Wehler and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the [[modernization theory]] of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''German Studies Review'' 1984 7(3): 451-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte==
''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' (1987–) is Wehler's comprehensive 5-volume history of German society in the eighteenth-twentieth centuries. Each volume approaches historical processes from a social history perspective, organized under the themes of demographics, economics, and social equality.  His detailed structural analysis of developmental processes supported by a vast body of notes and statistics sometimes obscures the larger context. Nonetheless, patterns of continuity and change in the social fabric are emphasized.   More than a historiographical synthesis of Ranke and Marx (envisioned by some German historians after the catastrophe of World War I), Wehler's work incorporates [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of authority, economy, and culture and strives toward a concept of "total history."

Volumes 1–2 cover the period from feudalism through the Revolution of 1848. Volume 3 ''Von der "Deutschen Doppelrevolution" bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914'' (1995) employs Wehler's longtime emphasis on a German [[Sonderweg]] or "special path" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the twentieth century. Wehler places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s–1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  Wehler's ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914–1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society.  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernization of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's fourth volume is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the twentieth century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler.  The fifth volume will extend to 1990; none of the series has yet been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871–1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
British historian of Germany [[Richard J. Evans]] disagreed with the Bielefeld school regarding the Sonderweg thesis. Instead he argued for the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the twentieth century in a "[[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|failed bourgeois revolution]]" in 1848. Influenced by the [[New Left]], Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history in the Imperial period "from below."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow, "Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History" ''The American Historical Review'', February 1983, Volume 88#1 pages 53–72 quote on page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'', he launched a critique of the "top-down" approach of the Bielefeld School. Evans and the others wanted a perspective from the Left that stressed the importance of the working class by highlighting "the importance of the grass roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, "Introduction: Wilhelm II's Germany and the Historians" in Evans, ed. ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'' (1978) pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Along with historians [[Geoff Eley]] and [[David Blackbourn]], Evans emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;See Evans, ''In Defence of History,'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural turn===
From the 1980s, however, the Bielefeld school was increasingly challenged by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'? On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Modernization Theory for History." ''Rethinking History'' 2006 10(2): 171-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kocka responded by arguing that social history has become so all-pervasive that it has lost its position as the cutting edge within historiography. He says, "But: in the meantime social historians' approaches, viewpoints, topics and results have been accepted and incorporated by many other historians who would not call themselves social historians. Social history has successfully penetrated its opponents."  He expects to see a return to social history, this time with more cultural and linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Magnússon, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In biology, a '''blastomere''' is a type of [[Cell (biology)|cell]] produced by [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] (cell division) of the [[zygote]] after [[fertilization]] and is an essential part of [[blastula]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69084/blastomere Blastomere  Encyclopædia Britannica]. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 06 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human blastomere==

In humans, '''blastomere''' formation begins immediately following fertilization and continues through the first week of [[embryonic development]].  About 90 minutes after fertilization, the [[zygote]] divides into two cells.  These [[mitosis|mitotic division]]s continue and result in a grouping of cells called blastomeres. During this process, the total size of the [[embryo]] does not increase, so each division results in smaller and smaller cells.  When the zygote contains 16 to 32 blastomeres it is referred to as a "[[morula]]."

===Clinical disorders===

It is possible for errors to occur during this process of repetitive cell division.  Common among these errors is for the [[DNA|genetic material]] to not be divided evenly.  Normally, when a cell divides each daughter cell has the same genetic material as the parent cell.  If the genetic material does not split evenly between the two daughter cells, an event called "[[nondisjunction]]" occurs.  Since this event occurs in only one of the several cells that exist at this point, the embryo will continue to develop but will have some normal cells and some abnormal cells.  The people are "mosaics" of normal and abnormal cells, so this disorder is called "[[Mosaic (genetics)|numerical mosaicism]]".

'''Certified wood''' and paper products come from responsibly managed forests – as defined by a particular standard. With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore Forest Certification Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
'''Forest certification''' programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include:

Basic requirements of credible forest certification programs include:
* Protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration (e.g., replanting and reforestation).
* Third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies.
* Publicly available certification audit summaries.
* Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards development process.
* Complaints and appeals process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf National Association of State Foresters Policy Statement 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Today there are more than 50 certification programs worldwide &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Sustainable_Forests/Third_Party_Forest_Certification.pdf Third-Party Forest Certification in British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) and the [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC).

The PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 115] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between [[Environmental organizations|environmental]] [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]], forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including [[Jared Diamond]], have suggested that many competing standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== United States and Canada ===

In the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the [[American Tree Farm System]] (ATFS), the [[Canadian Standards Association]]’s [[Sustainable Forest Management Standard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ CSA International Forest Products Marking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019030053/http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ |date=2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] (SFI) Program. ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. The FSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsccanada.org/forestmanagementstd.htm Forest Stewardship Council Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fscus.org FSC United States]&lt;/ref&gt; program is applied throughout North America. SFI is the world’s largest regional forest certification program in terms of total certified forest area[1].

The [[National Association of State Foresters]] in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports ''all'' of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: “... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability.... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‘one size fits all’ approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs.”.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf Forest Certification as it Contributes to Sustainable Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Council of Forest Ministers]] issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: “In Canada, each jurisdiction’s forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an {{sic|hide=y|over-|arching}} framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada’s forest management laws, and to document the country’s world-class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccfm.org/pdf/CCFM_Statement_FRandEN.pdf#page=2 Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Statement on Forest Certification Standards in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain-of-custody certification==

Chain of Custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process – from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests.

The United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 118] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future expansion==

Forest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world’s forest under at least one certification program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 113] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification.

Third-party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers’ market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 114] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper, publishing, printing and packaging – commitments to increase the use of responsible paper sources by large publishers such as Time Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeinc.com/community/sustainability.php Time Inc. Sustainability Report 2009-2010 page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; has probably been the most significant factor driving growth in forest and chain-of-custody certification.
* Green public procurement – governments such as the UK and the Netherlands have adopted green timber procurement policies, including recognition of FSC and PEFC endorsed programs. An example is the UK’s Central Point of Expertise on Timber (set up by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and operated by ProForest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpet.org.uk/evidence-of-compliance/category-a-evidence/introduction Central Point of Expertise on Timber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Green building – standards for green building incentivize and reward the use of certified wood products.
*Illegal logging – new legislation designed to minimize the risk of illegal wood entering supply chains such as the amended Lacey Act in the United States has created a strong incentive to demand independently certified wood that can address illegal logging concerns.

The World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/stories/2009/12/fact-sheet-are-you-ready-lacey-act World Resources Institute fact sheet Are You Ready for the Lacey Act?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cytodeme''' is the total assembly of organisms that use an identical suite of chromosomes to carry their genes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term was first printed in the 1950s in a book by Heslop-Harrison.&lt;ref name="Heslop-Harrison"&gt;Heslop-Harrison,1953.''New Concepts in Flowering Plant Taxonomy'' Heineman, London&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the ''Deme Terminology''&lt;ref name="Gilmour &amp; Gregor"&gt;Gilmour &amp; Gregor, 1939. "Demes:a suggested new terminology" ''Nature, London'' '''144''':333-334&lt;/ref&gt; - he continued ''"cytodeme, a population differing in some distinctive cytological feature from others."'' In most cases the suite is composed of several pairs of [[homologous chromosome]]s with or without a pair of [[sex chromosome]]s. Since the only acceptable proof of the identity ([[homology (biology)|homology]]) of chromosomes lies in their ability to pair fully from end to end during [[meiosis]] it follows that:

#In asexual taxa membership of a cytodeme can only be presumed on such evidence as visual similarity of chromosomal ideotype, but never proved.
#In sexual taxa all of the members of one cytodeme are fully intercompatible (within the limits of sex and other genetical constraints like self-incompatibility mechanisms) yielding the fertile progeny which proves their membership.

As a general rule for most species all of its members are of the same cytodeme excepting only the infrequent [[aneuploid]] aberrants. However some species are known to include several chromosome races which must necessarily belong to different cytodemes. Although it is not intrinsic in the formal definition it is a matter of common observation that members of different cytodemes are essentially cross-incompatible and any hybrids that do arise are usually highly infertile.

==Significance==
The current surgance of interest in cytodemes stems from the realisation that membership of the cytodeme is not necessarily restricted to the members of one species: frequently two or more species are in fact of the same cytodeme. Although fully intercompatible and yielding fertile hybrids when they do cross these species never or rarely cross-breed in the natural environment because they are spatially isolated, geographically and/or ecologically. Typically the species involved are members of the same genus. There are now a substantial number of cases in which two or more species of the same cytodeme are clearly different and even in different genera. Thus all five [[diploid]] species recognised in the genus ''[[Brassicella]]'' and both species recognised in the genus ''[[Hutera]]'' (7spp. in total) are in the same cytodeme.&lt;ref name="Harberd"&gt;Harberd,1972. "A contribution to the cyto-taxonomy of ''Brassica''(Cruciferae) and its allies." ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society''.'''65''':1-23&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most extreme case on record concerns the wild grass, [[teosinte]], ''[[Euchlaena mexicana]]'' and the strikingly different Maize, or Indian Corn, ''[[Zea mays]]'', both 2n=20, fully interfertile and yielding fertile [[hybrid (genetics)|hybrids]].&lt;ref name="Beadle"&gt;Beadle, 1980. "The Ancestry of Corn". ''Scientific American'','''242''':112-119&lt;/ref&gt; There is perhaps a remote possibility that two such very different species could have evolved independently from distinct sources and converged in their chromosomal ideotype until they became members of the same cytodeme (including the capacity to cross-breed). It is more likely, though, that the cytodeme arose first complete with its suite of chromosomes and breeding patterns all intact and then, remaining constant in its fundamentals, it diversified into species sometimes so different as to merit generic distinction. Thus, in what may be termed the ''cytodeme adjunct'' to Darwinian theory, evolution becomes a two-stage process - first, the establishment of distinct cytodemes reproductively isolated both from one another and from all previously existing cytodemes; second, diversification within cytodeme to yield taxonomically recognisable (but not reproductively isolated) species.

Whereas the second stage is [[Natural Selection]] as expounded by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]],&lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;Darwin,1859.''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection''. John Murray, London&lt;/ref&gt; the first stage is not necessarily Darwinian{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. In the special case of [[polyploidy]] it is known that the first stage is not Darwinian. Doubling the chromosome number of the [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]] hybrid between two diploid cytodemes yields an [[allotetraploid]] which is both fertile within its bounds and essentially incompatible with all previous life forms.

As yet no mechanism is known which could account for the origin of new diploid cytodemes - nor is there any proof that there are any diploid cytodemes of recent origin. Indeed, the evidence is that cytodemes are remarkably long lived. Presumably the ''[[Platanus]]'' cytodeme existed on [[Pangaea]] before that land fragmented. The present day forms of ''Platanus'' - ''[[Platanus orientalis|P. orientalis]]'' in Europe and ''[[Platanus occidentalis|P. occidentalis]]'' in America - are fully intercompatible when brought together artificially in Botanic Gardens yielding fertile hybrids like the London plane,&lt;ref name="Santamour"&gt;Santamour, 1972. "Interspecific hybrids in ''Platanus''." ''Forest Science''.'''18''':236-239.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing not only that they are in the same cytodeme as one another but also that they are both in the same cytodeme as their common ancestor of approximately 200 million years ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8051">'''Feminist HCI''' is a subfield of [[human-computer interaction]] (commonly called HCI) that focuses on helping the field of  HCI build interactions that pay attention to [[gender]], [[Gender equality|equity]], and [[social justice]] in [[research]] and in the [[Design|design process]].

==Overview==
Feminist HCI sets a stage for the explicit inclusion of [[feminism]] in HCI. Starting with Shaowen Bardzell's 2010 article "Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design", feminist HCI looks to the design and evaluation of interactive computing systems from a [[feminism|feminist]] lens.&lt;ref name=Bardzell_1&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Shaowen|title=Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2010|pages=1301–1310|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753521|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753521|isbn=9781605589299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building off of the epistemology of [[Standpoint feminism|feminist standpoint theory]], feminist HCI is focused on highlighting the values feminism in HCI work, like equity, diversity, and social justice, as well as on understanding the relationship gender has to the design and evaluation of interactive systems. Given that feminism is a heterogeneous concept, there is no singular methodology for undertaking feminist HCI projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Shaowen|last2=Bardzell|first2=Jeffrey|title=Towards a Feminist HCI Methodology: Social Science, Feminism, and HCI|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2011|pages=675–684|doi=10.1145/1978942.1979041|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1979041|isbn=9781450302289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bridging the gap between feminism and HCI, Feminist HCI has applications in theory, methodology, user research, and evaluation that will allow practitioners to critique systems already in place as well as generate new HCI practices focused on gender, equity, and social justice. Theoretical contributions of feminism like the [[Feminist technoscience|masculinity of technology]] and the [[Social construction of gender|social production of gender]] point towards the importance of addressing gender and equity directly in HCI.&lt;ref name=Rode&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rode|first1=Jennifer A.|title=A theoretical agenda for feminist HCI|journal=Interacting with Computers|date=2011|volume=23|issue=5|pages=393–400|url=https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article-abstract/23/5/393/653472|doi=10.1016/j.intcom.2011.04.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualities of feminist interaction==
Building off of interaction design, Feminist HCI builds on six core qualities to feminist interaction:&lt;ref name="Bardzell_1" /&gt;
* '''[[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]]''': Building on [[Standpoint feminism|feminist standpoint theory]], this quality argues that human experience is too varied to be captured within the concept of [[universalism]], thus pluralism, or heterogeneity, in design is of critical importance to HCI work.  
* '''[[Participation (decision making)|Participation]]''': Engaging users as active contributors to the design process (e.g., [[participatory design]]) is important for understanding and respecting the full range of contributions users can make. Feminist HCI argues that this work should occur alongside traditional [[usability testing]].  
* '''[[Advocacy]]''': Articulating concerns with the values that get built into a design by championing for well-motivated of ideas for creating just design choices. For instance, a [[needs analysis]] may reinforce discriminatory design behavior like design choices criticized by [[Gender HCI]]. Participatory approaches, like [[participatory design]], support advocacy.
* '''[[Human ecology|Ecology]]''': Maintaining a focus on the larger social structures (ecosystems) that a design impacts throughout the process of development. For example, the way a house is designed has an impact on structuring the lives of people who live in it (see [[feminism and modern architecture]] for additional information). Likewise, HCI artifacts exist within a larger ecosystem that impacts both the design process and the user. 
* '''[[Embodied embedded cognition|Embodiment]]''': Contrasting from earlier HCI notions of a disembodied user (such as [[Human–computer interaction#Mental model principles|mental models]]), concentrating on the material attributes of human-computer interactions is essential for understanding the way differences and commonalities impact interaction. 
* '''[[Reflexivity (social theory)|Self-disclosure]]''': Bringing to light the foundational assumptions inherent in everyday design allows us to understand how well the design model of a user matches the actual users.

==Select feminist HCI findings==
The following presents a sampling of results from research utilizing feminist HCI:

*''Six qualities of feminist interaction in an activist [[online community]].''
** Jill Dimond et al.'s studies of [[Hollaback!]] outlines how activist [[Computer-supported cooperative work|CSCW]] systems embody Feminist HCI in concrete ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dimond|first1=Jill|title=Feminist HCI for real: Designing technology in support of a social movement|date=2012|url=https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/45778|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|hdl=1853/45778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dimond|first1=Jill P.|last2=Dye|first2=Michaelanne|last3=Larose|first3=Daphne|last4=Bruckman|first4=Amy S.|title=Hollaback!: The Role of Storytelling Online in a Social Movement Organization|journal=Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work|date=2013|pages=477–490|doi=10.1145/2441776.2441831|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2441831|isbn=9781450313315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, these studies examine feminist HCI through activist online communities describing how the six qualities of feminist interaction design play out in the work and experiences of site designers and site users.
*''Designing [[postpartum]] technologies by and for mothers using feminist HCI.''
** Catherine D'Ignazio et al.'s work highlights participation, advocacy, and ecology to improve [[breast pump]] technologies. By getting input from more than 1000 mothers, researchers put forth a number of improvements that could be made to the breast pump while discussing the wider impacts this type of research can make on improving postpartum technologies broadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=D'Ignazio|first1=Catherine|last2=Hope|first2=Alexis|last3=Michelson|first3=Becky|last4=Churchill|first4=Robyn|last5=Zuckerman|first5=Ethan|title=A Feminist HCI Approach to Designing Postpartum Technologies: "When I First Saw a Breast Pump I Was Wondering if It Was a Joke"|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2016|pages=2612–2622|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858460|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858460|isbn=9781450333627}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Exploring implementation feminist HCI qualities in design when the users of a site design it themselves.''
** Casey Fiesler et al.'s work details how an online [[fan fiction]] community, consisting mostly of women, designed their own site. This site, [[Archive of Our Own]], embedded the values most important to the community, such as [[accessibility]], an embodiment of the feminist design quality pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fiesler|first1=Casey|last2=Morrison|first2=Shannon|last3=Bruckman|first3=Amy S.|title=An Archive of Their Own: A Case Study of Feminist HCI and Values in Design|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=2016|pages=2574–2585|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858409|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858409|isbn=9781450333627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words.{{dubious|date=July 2016}} Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as figures of speech can introduce an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation.{{dubious|date=July 2016}}

== Four rhetorical operations ==
{{Main|Rhetorical operations}}

[[Classical rhetoric]]ians classified figures of speech into [[rhetorical operations|four categories]] or ''[[quadripartita]] ratio'':&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen, Jeroen (2008) ''[http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio Imitatio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714140654/http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio |date=2015-07-14 }}'' {{ISBN|978-90-8704-027-7}} [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205211147/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html |date=2008-12-05 }} translated to English by Kristine Steenbergh. Quote from the summary: &lt;blockquote&gt;Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring
* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation

These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (addition), ἔνδεια (omission), μετάθεσις (transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (permutation).&lt;ref&gt;Book V, 21.29, pp.303–5&lt;/ref&gt; Quintillian then mentioned them in ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38–41. And also in Book VI [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/6C*.html Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philo of Alexandria]] also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις), transposition (μετάθεσις), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4B*.html Rhetorica ad Herennium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Figures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:

* "Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran" is an example of [[alliteration]], where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.
:Whereas, "Sister Suzy sewing socks for soldiers" is a particular form of alliteration called [[sibilance]], because it repeats the letter ''s''.
:Both are commonly used in poetry.
* "She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains" is a variety of [[zeugma]] called a [[syllepsis]]. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a [[pun]], that she might be climbing up the curtains. The [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.
* "Painful pride" is an [[oxymoron]] where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.
*"An Einstein" is an example of [[synecdoche]], as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.
* "I had butterflies in my stomach" is a [[metaphor]], referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.
:To say "it was like having some butterflies in my stomach" would be a [[simile]], because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.
:To say "It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach", "It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach", or "I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach" could be a [[hyperbole]], because it is exaggerated.
*"That filthy place was really dirty" is an example of [[Tautology (grammar)|tautology]], as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.

Scholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. ''[[Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes]]'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|schēma}}, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, "John, my best friend" uses the scheme known as [[apposition]]. ''[[Trope (linguistics)|Tropes]]'' (from Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|trepein}}, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning ("For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men").

During the [[Renaissance]], scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book "Literature – Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay"&lt;ref&gt;Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-557112-9}}, pp.451&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense."

For simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., "Figures of Disorder"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience. Some of those listed may be considered [[rhetorical device]]s, which are similar in many ways.

Similarly, saying "She is not a beauty queen," means "She is ugly" or saying "I am not as young as I used to be" in order to avoid saying "I am old".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4018">'''GVA Consultants''' is a Swedish marine and offshore engineering company specialising in the design of [[oil platform|offshore structures]], and [[semi-submersible]] platforms.

==History==
The experience of GVA as a marine engineering company stretches back more than 25 years. There is an even longer history of building ships of various types, semi-submersibles, jack-ups and offshore modules at the shipyard [[Götaverken|Götaverken Arendal AB]] where GVA is based.&lt;ref name="GVA History"&gt;"[http://www.gvac.se/history/GVA Official Website-About us-History]" GVA Consultants. Retrieved 7 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1970s the yard focused mainly on the offshore industry. Thus, the company designed, constructed and delivered 14 semisubmersibles from its facilities in Gothenburg. Seven units of the GVA series have also been built by yards all over the world, in different sizes and for various requirements. The units built at the yard in Gothenburg were adapted for duties such as production, drilling, diving support and accommodation/service. The deliveries included six Pacesetter type units and eight GVA designs.

The shipyard closed down in 1989 and GVA Consultants AB was established from the shipyards technical departments. GVA started out as a small company focusing on engineering services and conceptual studies. The company grew considerably during the years when larger contracts such as [[Visund]], [[troll gas field|Troll C]], [[Åsgard B]] and [[Kristin Gas Field]] were awarded to them. The company has continued to grow and has taken on even larger projects such as the [[Thunder Horse Oil Field|Thunder Horse]] and [[Atlantis Oil Field|Atlantis]] oil fields.

In 2001, [[KBR (Company)|Halliburton KBR]] (KBR), formerly Kellogg Brown &amp; Root acquired GVA Consultants AB from [[BMT Limited|British Maritime Technology Ltd]] (BMT) for an undisclosed amount."&lt;ref name="GVA Acquired"&gt;"[http://www.icis.com/Articles/2001/11/19/151472/management-in-brief.html Halliburton Buys GVA]". ICIS.com, 19 November 2001, ''Management in Brief''. Retrieved 7 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Halliburton KBR was the engineering and construction segment of [[Halliburton]], the world's largest provider of products and services to the petroleum and energy industries.

GVA Consultant's range of products and services includes: 
*Conceptual designs
*Basic designs for the GVA Series of semi-submersibles 
*Basic designs for other vessels
*Basic design for conversions or upgrades
*Consultation and project management support
*Research &amp; development

GVA is a subsidiary to KBR but operates as a fully independent company providing specialized design services.

'''Geodetic astronomy''' or '''astro-geodesy''' is the application of [[astronomy|astronomical]] methods into [[Wiktionary:Network|network]]s and technical projects of [[geodesy]].

The most important topics are:
* Establishment of [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] systems (e.g. [[ED50]]) or at expeditions
* [[apparent places]] of stars, and their [[proper motion]]s 
* precise astronomical [[astro navigation|navigation]]
* astro-geodetic [[geoid]] determination
* modelling the rock [[density|densities]] of the topography and of [[geological]] layers in the [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]]
* [[Satellite geodesy]] using the background of [[star]]s
* Monitoring of the [[Earth rotation]] and polar wandering
* Contribution to the [[time system]] of physics and [[geosciences]]

Important '''measuring techniques''' are:
* [[Latitude]] and [[longitude]] determination by [[theodolite]]s, tacheometers, [[astrolabe]]s or [[zenith camera]]s
* [[time]] and [[star position]]s by observation of [[star transit]]s, e.g. by [[meridian circle]]s (visual, photographic or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]])
* [[Azimuth]] measurements 
** for the exact orientation of [[geodetic network]]s
** for mutual [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]]s between terrestrial and space methods
** for improved accuracy by means of "[[Laplace point]]s" at special fixed points
* [[Vertical deflection]] measurements and their use
** in geoid determination
** in mathematical [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]] of very precise networks
** for geophysical and [[geological]] purposes (see above)
* Modern [[space|spatial]] methods
** [[VLBI]] with radio sources ([[quasar]]s)
** [[Astrometry]] of stars by scanning satellites like [[Hipparcos]] or the future [[Gaia probe|Gaia]].

The [[accuracy]] of these methods depends on the [[measuring instrument|instrument]] and its spectral wavelength, the measuring or scanning method, the time amount (versus economy), the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] situation, the stability of the surface resp. the satellite, on mechanical and [[temperature]] effects to the instrument, on the experience and skill of the [[observation|observer]], and on the accuracy of the physical-mathematical [[mathematical model|models]].

Therefore, the accuracy reaches from 60" (navigation, ~1 mile) to 0,001" and better (a few cm; satellites, VLBI), e.g.:
* [[angle]]s ([[vertical direction|vertical]] deflections and [[azimuth]]s) ±1" up to 0,1"
* geoid determination &amp; height systems ca. 5&amp;nbsp;cm up to 0,2&amp;nbsp;cm
* [[astrometry|astronomical]] lat/long and star positions ±1" up to 0,01"
* [[HIPPARCOS]] star positions ±0,001"
* [[VLBI]] quasar positions and [[Earth's rotation]] poles 0,001 to 0,0001" (cm...mm)

[[File:Carp gill defect.jpg|thumb|right|The red gills of this [[common carp]] are visible as a result of a [[operculum (fish)|gill flap]] [[birth defect]].]]
A '''gill''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-gill.ogg|ɡ|ɪ|l}}) is a [[respiration organ|respiratory organ]] found in many [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] organisms that extracts dissolved [[oxygen]] from [[water]] and excretes [[carbon dioxide]]. The gills of some species, such as [[hermit crab]]s, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large [[surface area]] to the external environment. '''Branchia''' (pl. branchiae) is the zoologists' name for gills (from Ancient Greek).

With the exception of some aquatic [[insect]]s, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain [[blood]] or [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]], from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. The blood carries oxygen to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water. Gills or gill-like organs, located in different parts of the body, are found in various groups of aquatic animals, including [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s, insects, fish, and [[amphibian]]s. [[Semiaquatic|Semiterrestrial]] marine animals such as [[crab]]s and [[mudskipper]]s have gill chambers in which they store water, enabling them to use the dissolved oxygen when they are on land.

== History ==
[[Galen]] observed that fish had multitudes of openings (''foramina''), big enough to admit gases, but too fine to give passage to water. [[Pliny the Elder]] held that fish respired by their gills, but observed that [[Aristotle]] was of another opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''branchia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|βράγχια}}, "gills", plural of {{lang|grc|βράγχιον}} (in singular, meaning a [[fin]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Branchia". ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. 2nd Ed. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Many microscopic aquatic animals, and some larger but inactive ones, can absorb sufficient oxygen through the entire surface of their bodies, and so can respire adequately without gills. However, more complex or more active aquatic organisms usually require a gill or gills. Many invertebrates, and even amphibians, use both the body surface and gills for gaseous exchange.&lt;ref name=Dorit&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=273-276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gills usually consist of thin filaments of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[Lamella (surface anatomy)|lamellaee]] (plates), branches, or slender, tufted [[Process (anatomy)|processes]] that have a highly folded surface to increase [[surface area]]. The delicate nature of the gills is possible because the surrounding water provides support. The blood or other body fluid must be in intimate contact with the respiratory surface for ease of diffusion.&lt;ref name=Dorit/&gt;

A high surface area is crucial to the [[gas exchange]] of aquatic organisms, as water contains only a small fraction of the [[dissolved oxygen]] that [[air]] does. A [[cubic meter]] of air contains about 250 [[grams]] of oxygen at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]. The concentration of oxygen in water is lower than in air and it diffuses more slowly. In [[fresh water]], the dissolved oxygen content is approximately 8&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/L compared to that of air which is 210&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/L.&lt;ref name="Advanced Biology"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Biology|author1=M. b. v. Roberts |author2=Michael Reiss |author3=Grace Monger |pages=164–165|publisher=Nelson|year=2000|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is 777 times more dense than air and is 100 times more viscous.&lt;ref name="Advanced Biology"/&gt; Oxygen has a diffusion rate in air 10,000 times greater than in water.&lt;ref name="Advanced Biology"/&gt; The use of sac-like lungs to remove oxygen from water would not be efficient enough to sustain life.&lt;ref name="Advanced Biology"/&gt; Rather than using lungs, "[g]aseous exchange takes place across the surface of highly vascularised gills over which a one-way current of water is kept flowing by a specialised pumping mechanism. The density of the water prevents the gills from collapsing and lying on top of each other, which is what happens when a fish is taken out of water."&lt;ref name="Advanced Biology"/&gt;

Usually water is moved across the gills in one direction by the current, by the motion of the animal through the water, by the beating of cilia or other appendages, or by means of a pumping mechanism. In fish and some molluscs, the efficiency of the gills is greatly enhanced by a [[countercurrent exchange]] mechanism in which the water passes over the gills in the opposite direction to the flow of blood through them. This mechanism is very efficient and as much as 90% of the dissolved oxygen in the water may be recovered.&lt;ref name=Dorit/&gt;

== Vertebrates ==
[[File:FreshwaterFishGill400x7.jpg|thumb|right|Freshwater Fish Gills magnified 400 times]]
The gills of [[vertebrate]]s typically develop in the walls of the [[pharynx]], along a series of gill slits opening to the exterior. Most species employ a [[countercurrent exchange]] system to enhance the diffusion of substances in and out of the gill, with blood and water flowing in opposite directions to each other. The gills are composed of comb-like filaments, the '''gill lamellae''', which help increase their surface area for oxygen exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Manual Of Fish Health |last= Andrews |first= Chris |author2=Adrian Exell |author3=Neville Carrington  |year= 2003 |publisher= Firefly Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a fish breathes, it draws in a mouthful of water at regular intervals. Then it draws the sides of its throat together, forcing the water through the gill openings, so it passes over the gills to the outside. Fish gill slits may be the evolutionary ancestors of the [[tonsil]]s, [[thymus gland]]s, and [[Eustachian tube]]s, as well as many other structures derived from the embryonic [[branchial pouch]]es.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Fish===
{{main|Fish gill}}
The gills of fish form a number of slits connecting the pharynx to the outside of the animal  on either side of the fish behind the head. Originally there were many slits, but during evolution, the number reduced, and modern fish mostly have five pairs, and never more than eight.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite book|author=Hughes, George Morgan|title=Comparative Physiology of Vertebrate Respiration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yy99QtoPEToC&amp;pg=PA8 |year=1963 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-15250-2 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cartilaginous fish====
[[Shark]]s and [[ray (fish)|rays]] typically have five pairs of gill slits that open directly to the outside of the body, though some more primitive sharks have six pairs and the [[Broadnose sevengill shark]] being the only cartilaginous fish exceeding this number. Adjacent slits are separated by a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] gill arch from which projects a cartilaginous '''gill ray'''. This gill ray is the support for the sheet-like interbranchial [[septum]], which the individual lamellae of the gills lie on either side of. The base of the arch may also support [[gill raker]]s, projections into the pharyngeal cavity that help to prevent large pieces of debris from damaging the delicate gills.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Alfred Romer|Romer, Alfred Sherwood]]|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977|title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International|location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 316–327|isbn= 0-03-910284-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller opening, the [[spiracle]], lies in the back of the first [[gill slit]]. This bears a small '''pseudobranch''' that resembles a gill in structure, but only receives blood already oxygenated by the true gills.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; The spiracle is thought to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the ear opening in [[higher vertebrates]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurin M. (1998): The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution. Part I-systematics, middle ear evolution, and jaw suspension. ''Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Zoologie, Paris'', 13e Série 19: pp 1-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most sharks rely on ram ventilation, forcing water into the mouth and over the gills by rapidly swimming forward. In slow-moving or bottom-dwelling species, especially among skates and rays, the spiracle may be enlarged, and the fish breathes by sucking water through this opening, instead of through the mouth.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

[[Chimaera]]s differ from other cartilagenous fish, having lost both the spiracle and the fifth gill slit. The remaining slits are covered by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], developed from the septum of the gill arch in front of the first gill.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

====Bony fish====
[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ cut.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The red gills inside a detached [[tuna]] head (viewed from behind)]]
In [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]], the gills lie in a branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum. The great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some over the course of evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

The gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum, so the gills alone project from the arch, supported by individual gill rays. Some species retain gill rakers. Though all but the most primitive bony fish lack spiracles, the pseudobranch associated with them often remains, being located at the base of the operculum. This is, however, often greatly reduced, consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gill-like structure.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

Marine [[teleost]]s also use gills to excrete [[electrolyte]]s. The gills' large surface area tends to create a problem for fish that seek to regulate the [[osmolarity]] of their internal fluids. Salt water is less dilute than these internal fluids, so saltwater fish lose large quantities of water osmotically through their gills. To regain the water, they drink large amounts of [[sea water]] and excrete the [[salt]]. Fresh water is more dilute than the internal fluids of fish, however, so freshwater fish gain water [[osmosis|osmotically]] through their gills.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

[[Lamprey]]s and [[hagfish]] do not have gill slits as such. Instead, the gills are contained in spherical pouches, with a circular opening to the outside. Like the gill slits of higher fish, each pouch contains two gills. In some cases, the openings may be fused together, effectively forming an operculum. Lampreys have seven pairs of pouches, while hagfishes may have six to fourteen, depending on the species. In the hagfish, the pouches connect with the pharynx internally and a separate tube which has no respiratory tissue (the pharyngocutaneous duct) develops beneath the pharynx proper, expelling ingested debris by closing a valve at its anterior end.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; [[Lungfish]] larvae also have [[external gills]], as does the primitive [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] ''[[Polypterus]]'', though the latter has a structure different from amphibians.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

===Amphibians===

[[Tadpole]]s of [[amphibian]]s have from three to five gill slits that do not contain actual gills. Usually no spiracle or true operculum is present, though many species have operculum-like structures. Instead of internal gills, they develop three feathery external gills that grow from the outer surface of the gill arches. Sometimes, adults retain these, but they usually disappear at [[metamorphosis]]. Examples of salamanders that retain their external gills upon reaching adulthood are the [[olm]] and the [[mudpuppy]].

Still, some extinct tetrapod groups did retain true gills. A study on ''[[Archegosaurus]]'' demonstrates that it had internal gills like true fish.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Witzmann; Elizabeth Brainerd (2017). "Modeling the physiology of the aquatic temnospondyl Archegosaurus decheni from the early Permian of Germany". Fossil Record. 20 (2): 105–127. doi:10.5194/fr-20-105-2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invertebrates ==
[[File:Pleurobranchaea meckelii.jpg|thumb|A live [[sea slug]], ''[[Pleurobranchaea meckelii]]'': The gill (or [[Ctenidium (mollusc)|ctenidium]]) is visible in this view of the right-hand side of the animal.]]
[[Crustacean]]s, [[mollusc]]s, and some aquatic insects have tufted gills or plate-like structures on the surfaces of their bodies. Gills of various types and designs, simple or more elaborate, have evolved independently in the past, even among the same class of animals. The segments of [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] bear [[Parapodium|parapodia]] many of which carry gills.&lt;ref name=Dorit/&gt; Sponges lack specialised respiratory structures, and the whole of the animal acts as a gill as water is drawn through its spongy structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Choudhary, S.|title=Teaching of Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIfw9sxcxDIC&amp;pg=PA269 |publisher=APH Publishing |isbn=978-81-7648-524-1 |page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic arthropods usually have gills which are in most cases modified appendages. In some crustaceans these are exposed directly to the water, while in others, they are protected inside a gill chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saxena, Amita|title=Text Book of Crustacea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uH7t82WQ1J0C&amp;pg=PA180 |year=2005 |publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=978-81-8356-016-0 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horseshoe crab]]s have [[Book lung#Book gills|book gills]] which are external flaps, each with many thin leaf-like membranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sekiguchi, K.|title=Biology of Horseshoe Crabs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXk_AAAAYAAJ|year=1988 |publisher=サイエンスハウス|isbn=978-4-915572-25-8|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many marine invertebrates such as [[Bivalvia|bivalve molluscs]] are [[filter feeder]]s. A current of water is maintained through the gills for gas exchange, and food particles are filtered out at the same time. These may be trapped in [[mucus]] and moved to the mouth by the beating of cilia.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberts, M.B.V.|title=Biology: A Functional Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASADBUVAiDUC&amp;pg=PA139 |year=1986 |publisher=Nelson Thornes |isbn=978-0-17-448019-8 |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respiration in the [[echinoderm]]s (such as [[starfish]] and [[sea urchin]]s) is carried out using a very primitive version of gills called papulae. These thin protuberances on the surface of the body contain [[diverticulum|diverticula]] of the [[water vascular system]]. 

[[File:Hermit Crab Gills.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caribbean hermit crab]]s have modified gills that allow them to live in humid conditions.]]
The gills of [[aquatic insect]]s are [[Trachea#Invertebrates|tracheal]], but the air tubes are sealed, commonly connected to thin external plates or tufted structures that allow diffusion. The oxygen in these tubes is renewed through the gills. In the [[larva]]l [[dragon fly]], the wall of the caudal end of the [[Gastrointestinal tract|alimentary tract]] ([[rectum]]) is richly supplied with tracheae as a rectal gill, and water pumped into and out of the rectum provides oxygen to the closed tracheae.

=== {{anchor|Plastron}} Plastrons ===
A '''plastron''' is a type of structural adaptation occurring among some aquatic arthropods (primarily insects), a form of inorganic gill which holds a thin film of atmospheric oxygen in an area with small openings called [[spiracle]]s that connect to the tracheal system. The plastron typically consists of dense patches of [[hydrophobic]] [[setae]] on the body, which prevent water entry into the spiracles, but may also involve scales or microscopic ridges projecting from the cuticle. The physical properties of the interface between the trapped air film and surrounding water allow gas exchange through the spiracles, almost as if the insect were in atmospheric air. [[Carbon dioxide]] diffuses into the surrounding water due to its high [[solubility]], while oxygen diffuses into the film as the concentration within the film has been reduced by [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], and nitrogen also diffuses out as its tension has been increased. Oxygen diffuses into the air film at a higher rate than nitrogen diffuses out. However, water surrounding the insect can become oxygen-depleted if there is no [[water movement]], so many such insects in still water actively direct a flow of water over their bodies.

The inorganic gill mechanism allows aquatic insects with plastrons to remain constantly submerged. Examples include many [[beetle]]s in the family [[Elmidae]], aquatic [[weevil]]s, and [[true bug]]s in the family [[Aphelocheiridae]], as well as at least one species of [[Ricinulei|ricinuleid arachnid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joachim Adis, Benjamin Messner &amp; [[Norman Platnick]] |year=1999 |title=Morphological structures and vertical distribution in the soil indicate facultative plastron respiration in ''Cryptocellus adisi'' (Arachnida, Ricinulei) from Central Amazonia |journal=[[Studies in Neotropical Fauna and Environment]] |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1076/snfe.34.1.1.8915}}&lt;/ref&gt; A somewhat similar mechanism is used by the [[diving bell spider]], which maintains an underwater bubble that exchanges gas like a plastron. Other diving insects (such as [[backswimmer]]s, and [[Hydrophilidae|hydrophilid beetles]]) may carry trapped air bubbles, but deplete the oxygen more quickly, and thus need constant replenishment.

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

The '''history of the [[Church–Turing thesis]]''' ("thesis") involves the [[history]] of the development of the study of the nature of functions whose values are effectively calculable; or, in more modern terms, functions whose values are algorithmically computable. It is an important topic in modern mathematical theory and computer science, particularly associated with the work of [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]].

The debate and discovery of the meaning of "computation" and "recursion" has been long and contentious.  This article provides detail of that debate and discovery from [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] in 1889 through recent discussion of the meaning of "[[axiom]]".

==Peano's nine axioms of arithmetic==
In 1889, [[Giuseppe Peano]] presented his ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'', based on the work of [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]]. [[Robert Soare|Soare]] proposes that the origination of "primitive recursion" began formally with the axioms of Peano, although
:"Well before the nineteenth century mathematicians used the principle of defining a function by induction. Dedekind 1888 proved, using accepted axioms, that such a definition defines a unique function, and he applied it to the definition of the functions m+n, m x n, and m&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;. Based on this work of Dedekind, Peano 1889 and 1891 wrote the familiar five [sic] axioms for the positive integers. As a companion to his fifth [sic] axiom, mathematical induction, Peano used definition by induction, which has been called ''primitive'' recursion (since [[Rózsa Péter|Péter]] 1934 and Kleene 1936) ... ."&lt;ref&gt;Soare 1996:5&lt;/ref&gt;

Observe that ''in fact'' [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] are ''9'' in number and axiom ''9'' is the recursion/induction axiom.&lt;ref&gt;cf: van Heijenoort 1976:94&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Subsequently the 9 were reduced to 5 as "Axioms 2, 3, 4 and 5 which deal with identity, belong to the underlying logic. This leaves the five axioms that have become universally known as "the Peano axioms ... Peano acknowledges (1891b, p. 93) that his axioms come from Dedekind ... ."&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1976:83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hilbert and the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]==
At the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in 1900 in Paris the famous mathematician [[David Hilbert]] posed a set of problems – now known as [[Hilbert's problems]] – his beacon illuminating the way for mathematicians of the twentieth century. Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems introduced the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (the "decision problem"). In his 2nd problem he asked for a proof that "arithmetic" is "[[consistent]]". [[Kurt Gödel]] would prove in 1931 that, within what he called "P" (nowadays called [[Peano Arithmetic]]), "there exist undecidable sentences [propositions]".&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1931a in (Davis 1965:6), 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:596)&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, "the consistency of P is unprovable in P, provided P is consistent".&lt;ref&gt;Gödel’s theorem IX, Gödel 1931a in (Davis 1965:36)&lt;/ref&gt;  While Gödel’s proof would display the tools necessary for [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] to resolve the Entscheidungsproblem, he himself would not answer it.

It is within Hilbert's [[Hilbert's tenth problem|10th problem]] where the question of an "Entscheidungsproblem" actually appears.   The heart of matter was the following question: "What do we mean when we say that a function is 'effectively calculable'"?  The answer would be something to this effect: "When the function is calculated by a ''mechanical'' procedure (process, method)."  Although stated easily nowadays, the question (and answer) would float about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely.

Hilbert's original description of problem 10 begins as follows:
:"'''10. Determination of the solvability of a [[Diophantine equation]]'''.  Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with [[Integer|rational integral]] [[coefficient]]s: To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.&lt;ref&gt;This translation, and the original text in German, appears in (Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007:1-2)&lt;/ref&gt;"
&lt;!--:"The Entscheidungsproblem [decision problem for [[First-order logic|first-order logic]]] is solved when we know a procedure that allows for any given [[logical expression]] to decide by finitely many operations its validity or satisfiability ... The Entscheidungsproblem must be considered the main problem of [[Mathematical logic|mathematical logic]]. ... The solution of the Entscheidungsproblem is of fundamental significance for the theory of all domains whose propositions could be developed on the basis of a finite number of [[Axiom|axioms]]"--&gt;
By 1922, the specific question of an "Entscheidungsproblem" applied to Diophantine equations had developed into the more general question about a "decision method" for ''any'' [[Formula|mathematical formula]]. &lt;!--, and H. Behmann stated that
:"... most general form of the Entscheidungsproblem [is] as follows:
::"A quite definite generally applicable prescription is required which will allow one to decide in a finite number of steps the truth or falsity of a given purely logical assertion ..."&lt;ref&gt;Gandy 1994:57 quoting Behmann&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Behmann remarks that ... the general problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding which mathematical propositions are true." (Gandy 1994:57) --&gt;
[[Martin Davis]] explains it this way: Suppose we are given a "calculational procedure" that consists of (1) a set of axioms and (2) a logical conclusion written in [[first-order logic]], that is—written in what Davis calls "[[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] rules of deduction" (or the modern equivalent of [[Boolean logic]]).  Gödel’s doctoral dissertation&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:592ff)&lt;/ref&gt; proved that Frege's rules were ''complete'' "... in the sense that every valid formula is provable".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:582&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that encouraging fact, could there be a generalized "calculational procedure" that would tell us whether a conclusion can be derived from its premises?  Davis calls such calculational procedures "[[algorithm]]s".  The Entscheidungsproblem would be an algorithm as well.  "In principle, an algorithm for [the] Entscheidungsproblem would have reduced all human deductive reasoning to brute calculation".&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:146&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words: Is there an "algorithm" that can tell us if ''any'' formula is "true" (i.e. an algorithm that always correctly yields a judgment "truth" or "falsehood"?)
:" ... it seemed clear to Hilbert that with the solution of this problem, the Entscheidungsproblem, that it should be possible in principle to settle all mathematical questions in a purely mechanical manner.  Hence, given unsolvable problems at all, if Hilbert was correct, then the Entscheidungsproblem itself should be unsolvable".&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1965:108&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed: What about our Entscheidungsproblem algorithm itself?  Can it determine, in a finite number of steps, whether it, itself, is “successful” and "truthful" (that is, it does not get hung up in an endless "circle" or "[[Control flow#Condition-controlled loops|loop]]", and it correctly yields a judgment "truth" or "falsehood" about its own behavior and results)?

==Three problems from Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems==
At the 1928 [[International Congress of Mathematicians|Congress]] [in [[Bologna|Bologna, Italy]]] [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] refines the question very carefully into three parts. The following is [[Stephen Hawking|Stephen Hawking's]] summary:
*"1. To prove that all true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the '''completeness''' of mathematics.
*"2. To prove that only true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the '''consistency''' of mathematics,
*"3. To prove the decidability of mathematics, that is, the existence of a '''decision procedure''' to decide the truth or falsity of any given mathematical proposition." &lt;ref&gt;Hawking 2005:1121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simple arithmetic functions irreducible to primitive recursion==
[[Gabriel Sudan]] (1927) and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] (1928) display [[Computable function|recursive functions]] that are not ''primitive'' recursive:

:"Are there [[recursion]]s that are not reducible to [[primitive recursion]]; and in particular can recursion be used to define a function which is not primitive recursive?

:"This question arose from a conjecture of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] in 1926 on the [[continuum problem]], and was answered [yes: there are recursions that are not primitive recursive] by Ackermann 1928."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:271&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. Kleene 1952:272-273&lt;/ref&gt; observes that [[Rózsa Péter]] (1935) simplified Ackermann's example ("cf. also Hilbert-[[Bernays]] 1934") and [[Raphael Robinson]] (1948). Péter exhibited another example (1935) that employed [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]. Péter (1950) and Ackermann (1940) also displayed "[[transfinite recursion]]s", and this led Kleene to wonder:
:"... whether we can characterize in any exact way the notion of any "recursion", or the class of all "recursive functions."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:273&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene concludes&lt;ref&gt;cf. Kleene 1952:274&lt;/ref&gt; that all "recursions" involve (i) the formal analysis he presents in his §54 ''Formal calculations of [[primitive recursive function]]s'' and, (ii) the use of [[mathematical induction]]. He immediately goes on to state that indeed the Gödel-Herbrand definition does indeed "characterize all recursive functions" – see the quote in [[#Kleene 1935|1934, below]].

==Gödel's proof==
In 1930, mathematicians gathered for a mathematics meeting and retirement event for [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. As luck would have it,
:"at the very same meeting, a young Czech mathematician, [[Kurt Gödel]], announced results which dealt it &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Hilbert's opinion that all three answers were YES] a serious blow."&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 1983:92&lt;/ref&gt;

He announced that the answer to the first two of Hilbert's three questions of 1928 was NO.

Subsequently in 1931 Gödel published his famous paper [http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related {{nowrap|Systems I.}}''] In his preface to this paper Martin Davis delivers a caution:
:"The reader should be warned that [in this particular paper] what Gödel calls ''recursive functions''  are now called ''[[primitive recursive functions]]''. (The revised terminology was introduced by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1936 in (Davis 1965:237ff)&lt;/ref&gt;)."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1965:4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gödel  expansion of "effective calculation"==
To quote [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] (1952), "The characterization of all "recursive functions" was accomplished in the definition of 'general recursive function' by [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] 1934, who built on a suggestion of [[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]" (Kleene 1952:274). Gödel delivered a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Princeton NJ. In a preface written by [[Martin Davis]]&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1965:39–40&lt;/ref&gt; Davis observes that
:"Dr. Gödel has stated in a letter that he was, at the time of these lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions ..."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 1965:40&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawson states that these lectures were meant to clarify concerns that the "incompleteness theorems were somehow dependent on the particularities of formalization":&lt;ref&gt;(Dawson 1997:101)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Gödel mentioned [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann's]] example in the final section of his 1934 paper, as a way of motivating the concept of "general recursive function" that he defined there; but earlier in footnote 3, he had already conjectured (as "a heuristic principle") that all finitarily computable functions could be obtained through recursions of such more general sorts.

:"The conjecture has since elicited much comment. In particular, when Martin Davis undertook to publish Gödel's 1934 lectures [in Davis 1965:41ff] he took it to be a variant of [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]; but in a letter to Davis ...&lt;ref&gt;[246: "KG to Martin Davis, 15 February 1965, Quoted in Gödel 1986–, vol. I, p. 341"]&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel stated emphatically that that was "not true" because at the time of those lectures he was "not at all convinced" that his concept of recursion comprised "all possible recursions." Rather, he said, "The conjecture stated there only refers to the equivalence of 'finite (computation) procedure' and 'recursive procedure.'" To clarify the issue Gödel added a postscript to the lectures,&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1964 in (Davis 1965:247) also reprinted in (Gödel 1986, vol. I:369–371)&lt;/ref&gt; in which he indicated that what had finally convinced him that the intuitively computable functions coincided with those that were general recursive was [[Alan Turing|Alan Turing's]] work {{Harv|Turing|1937}}.
:"Gödel's reluctance to regard either general recursiveness or λ-definability as adequate characterization of the informal notion of effective computability has been examined in detail by several authors [Footnote 248: "See especially Davis 1982; Gandy 1980 and 1988; Sieg 1994"]. There is a consensus that, in fact, neither Gödel's nor [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] formalisms were so perspicuous or intrinsically persuasive as Alan Turing's analysis, and [[Wilfried Sieg]] has argued that the evidence in favor of Church's Thesis provided by the "confluence of different notions" (the fact that the systems proposed by Church, Gödel, [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and Alan Turing all turned out to have the same extension) is less compelling than has generally supposed. Hence, quite apart from Gödel's innate caution there were good reasons for his skepticism. But what, then, ''was'' he attempting to achieve through his notion of general recursiveness? ...

:"Rather, Gödel obtained his definition [of the class of general recursive functions] through modification of Herbrand's ideas ...; and Wilfried Sieg has argued that his real purpose in the final section of the 1934 paper [the lecture notes] was "''to disassociate recursive functions from &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Herbrand's] [[epistemological]]ly restricted notion of proof''" by specifying "''mechanical'' rules for deriving equations." What was more ''general'' about Gödel's notion of "general" recursiveness was, Sieg suggests, that Herbrand had intended only to characterize those functions that could be ''proved'' to be recursive by ''finitary'' means [250]."&lt;ref&gt;Italics in the original Dawson 1997:101–102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] and [[J. Barkley Rosser|Rosser]] transcribed [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] 1934 lectures in Princeton. In his paper ''General Recursive Functions of Natural Numbers''&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:236ff)&lt;/ref&gt; Kleene states:

:"A definition of general recursive function of natural numbers was suggested by [[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]] to Gödel, and was used by Gödel with an important modification in a series of lectures at Princeton in 1934 ...&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:237)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A recursive function (relation) in the sense of Gödel ... will now be called a [[primitive recursive function]] (relation).&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:239)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church definition of "effectively calculable"==
[[Alonzo Church|Church's]] paper ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936) proved that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] was undecidable within the λ-calculus and Gödel-Herbrand's general recursion; moreover Church cites two theorems of [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene's]] that proved that the functions defined in the λ-calculus are identical to the functions defined by general recursion:
:"Theorem XVI. Every recursive function of positive integers is λ-definable.&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;
:"Theorem XVII. Every λ-definable function of positive integers is recursive.&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;
::"&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; ... .  In the form here it was first obtained by Kleene... .
::"&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; This result was obtained independently by the present author and S. C. Kleene at about the same time.

The paper opens with a very long footnote, 3. Another footnote, 9, is also of interest. Martin Davis states that "This paper is principally important for its explicit statement (since known as [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's thesis]]) that the functions which can be computed by a finite algorithm are precisely the recursive functions, and for the consequence that an explicit unsolvable problem can be given":&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:88)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; As will appear, this definition of effective calculability can be stated in either of two equivalent forms, (1) ... λ-definable ... 2) ... recursive ... . The notion of λ-definability is due jointly to the present author and S. C. Kleene, successive steps towards it having been taken by the present author in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'', vol. 34 (1933), p. 863, and Kleene in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', vol. 57 (1935), p. 219. The notion of recursiveness in the sense of §4 below is due jointly to [[Jacques Herbrand]] and [[Kurt Gödel]], as is there explained. And the proof of equivalence of the two notions is due chiefly to Kleene, but also partly to the present author and to J. B. Rosser&lt;!-- , as explained below --&gt; ... . The proposal to identify these notions with the intuitive notion of effective calculability is first made in the present paper (but see the first footnote to §7 below).

:"With the aid of the methods of Kleene (''American Journal of Mathematics'', 1935), the considerations of the present paper could, with comparatively slight modification be carried through entirely in terms of λ-definability, without making use of the notion of recursiveness. On the other hand, since the results of the present paper were obtained, it has been shown by Kleene (see his forthcoming paper, "General recursive functions of natural numbers") that analogous results can be obtained entirely in terms of recursiveness, without making use of λ-definability. The fact, however, that two such widely different and (in the opinion of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability turn out to be equivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of it."&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:90)&lt;/ref&gt;

Footnote 9 is in section ''§4 Recursive functions'':
:" &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;This definition [of "recursive"] is closely related to, and was suggested by, a definition of recursive functions which was proposed by Kurt Gödel, in lectures at Princeton, N. J., 1934, and credited by him in part to an unpublished suggestion of Jacques Herbrand. The principal features in which present definition of recursiveness differs from Gödel's are due to S. C. Kleene.
:" In a forthcoming paper by Kleene to be entitled "General recursive functions of natural numbers," ... it follows ... that every function recursive in the present sense is also recursive in the sense of Gödel (1934) and conversely."&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:95)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time prior to Church's paper ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936) a dialog occurred between Gödel and Church as to whether or not λ-definability was sufficient for the definition of the notion of "algorithm" and "effective calculability".

In Church (1936) we see, under the chapter §7 ''The notion of effective calculability'', a footnote 18 which states the following:
:"&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;The question of the relationship between effective calculability and recursiveness (which it is here proposed to answer by identifying the two notions) was raised by Gödel in conversation with the author. The corresponding question of the relationship between effective calculability and λ-definability had previously been proposed by the author independently." &lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:100)&lt;/ref&gt;

By "identifying" Church means – not "establishing the identity of" – but rather "to cause to be or become identical", "to conceive as united" (as in spirit, outlook or principle) (vt form), and (vi form) as "to be or become the same".&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster 1983:identifying&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post and "effective calculability" as "natural law"==
[[Emil Leon Post|Post's]] doubts as to whether or not recursion was an adequate definition of "effective calculability", plus the publishing of [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] paper, encouraged him in the fall of 1936 to propose a "formulation" with "psychological fidelity": A worker moves through "a sequence of spaces or boxes"&lt;ref name=Post289&gt;Post 1936 in (Davis 1965:289)&lt;/ref&gt; performing machine-like "primitive acts" on a sheet of paper in each box. The worker is equipped with "a fixed ualterable set of directions".&lt;ref name="Post289"/&gt; Each instruction consists of three or four symbols: (1) an identifying label/number, (2) an operation, (3) next instruction j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;; however, if the instruction is of type (e) and the determination is "yes" THEN instruction j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;' ELSE if it is "no" instruction j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The "primitive acts"&lt;ref name="Post289"/&gt; are of only 1 of 5 types: (a) mark the paper in the box he's in (or over-mark a mark already there), (b) erase the mark (or over-erase), (c) move one room to the right, (d) move one room to the left, (e) determine if the paper is marked or blank. The worker starts at step 1 in the starting-room, and does what the instructions instruct them to do. (See more at [[Post–Turing machine]].)

This matter, mentioned in the introduction about "intuitive theories" caused Post to take a potent poke at Church:
:"The writer expects the present formulation to turn out to be logically equivalent to recursiveness in the sense of the Gödel-Church development.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Its purpose, however, is not only to present a system of a certain logical potency but also, in its restricted field, of psychological fidelity. In the latter sense wider and wider formulations are contemplated. On the other hand, our aim will be to show that all such are logically reducible to formulation 1. We offer this conclusion at the present moment as a ''working hypothesis''. And to our mind such is Church's identification of effective calculability with recursivness.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;" (italics in original)
::&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [he sketches an approach to a proof]
::&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; "Cf. Church, lock. cit, pp. 346, 356-358. Actually the work already done by Church and others carries this identification considerably beyond the working hypothesis stage. ''But to mask this identification under a definition hides the fact'' that a fundamental discovery in the limitiations of mathematicizing power of Homo Sapiens has been made ''and blinds us to the need of its continual verification''."&lt;ref&gt;italics added, Post 1936 in (Davis 1965:291)&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words Post is saying "Just because you ''defined'' it so doesn't ''make'' it truly so; your definition is based on no more than an intuition." Post was searching for more than a definition: "The success of the above program would, for us, change this hypothesis not so much to a definition or to an axiom but to a ''natural law''. Only so, it seems to the writer, can [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] theorem ... and Church's results ... be transformed into conclusions concerning all symbolic logics and all methods of solvability."&lt;ref&gt;Italics in original, Post in (Davis 1965:291)&lt;/ref&gt;

This contentious stance finds grumpy expression in [[Alan Turing]] 1939, and it will reappear with Gödel, [[Robin Gandy|Gandy]], and Sieg.

==Turing and computability==
[[Alan Turing|A. M. Turing's]] paper [http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/e-library/sources/tp2-ie.pdf ''On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem''] was delivered to the London Mathematical Society in November 1936. Again the reader must bear in mind a caution: as used by Turing, the word "computer" is a human being, and the action of a "computer" he calls "computing"; for example, he states "Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper" (p.&amp;nbsp;135). ''But'' he uses the word "computation"&lt;ref name=Turing118&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:118)&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of his machine-definition, and his definition of "computable" numbers is as follows:
:"The "computable" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means ... .According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:116)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is Turing's definition of his "machine?" Turing gives two definitions, the first a summary in ''§1 Computing machines'' and another very similar in §9.I derived from his more detailed analysis of the actions a human "computer". With regards to his definition §1 he says that "justification lies in the fact that the human memory is necessarily limited",&lt;ref name=Turing117&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:117)&lt;/ref&gt; and he concludes §1 with the bald assertion of his proposed machine with his use of the word "all"

:"It is my contention that these operations [write symbol on tape-square, erase symbol, shift ''one'' square left, shift ''one'' square right, scan square for symbol and change machine-configuration as a consequence of ''one'' scanned symbol] include all those which are used in the computation of a number."&lt;ref name="Turing118"/&gt;

The emphasis of the word one in the above brackets is intentional. With regards to §9.I he allows the machine to examine ''more'' squares; it is this more-square sort of behavior that he claims typifies the actions of a computer (person):
:"The machine scans B squares corresponding to the B squares observed by the computer. In any move the machine can change a symbol on a scanned square or can change any one of the scanned squares to another square distant not more than L squares from one of the other scanned squares ... The machines just described do not differ very essentially from computing machines as defined in §2 [sic], and corresponding to any machine of this type a computing machine can be constructed to compute the same sequence, that is to say the sequence computed by the computer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:138)&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing goes on to define a "computing machine" in §2 is (i) "a-machine" ("automatic machine") as defined in §1 with the added restriction (ii): (ii) It prints two kinds of symbols – figures 0 and 1 – and other symbols. The figures 0 and 1 will represent "the sequence computed by the machine".&lt;ref name="Turing118"/&gt;

Furthermore, to define the if the ''number'' is to be considered "computable", the machine must print an infinite number of 0's and 1's; if not it is considered to be "circular"; otherwise it is considered to be "circle-free":
:"A number is computable if it differs by an integer from the number computed by a circle-free machine." &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:119)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he doesn't call it his "thesis", Turing proposes a proof that his "computability" is equivalent to [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] "effective calculability":
:"In a recent paper Alonzo Church has introduced an idea of "effective calculability", which is equivalent to my "computability", but is very differently defined ... The proof of equivalence between "computability" and "effective calculability" is outlined in an appendix to the present paper."&lt;ref name="Turing117"/&gt;

The ''Appendix: Computability and effective calculability'' begins in the following manner; observe that he does ''not'' mention ''recursion'' here, and in fact his proof-sketch has his machine munch strings of symbols in the λ-calculus and the calculus munch "complete configurations" of his machine, and nowhere is recursion mentioned. The proof of the equivalence of machine-computability and recursion must wait for [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] 1943 and 1952:
:"The theorem that all effectively calculable (λ-definable) sequences are computable and its converse are proved below in outline."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:149)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandy (1960) seems to confuse this bold proof-sketch with [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]; see 1960 and 1995 below. Moreover a careful reading of Turing's definitions leads the reader to observe that Turing was asserting that the "operations" of his proposed machine in §1 are ''sufficient'' to compute ''any'' computable number, and the machine that imitates the action of a human "computer" as presented in §9.I is a variety of this proposed machine. This point will be reiterated by Turing in 1939.

==Turing identifies effective calculability with machine computation==
[[Alan Turing|Alan Turing's]] massive Princeton PhD thesis (under [[Alonzo Church]]) appears as ''Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals''. In it he summarizes the quest for a definition of "effectively calculable". He proposes a '''definition''' as shown in the boldface type that specifically identifies (renders identical) the notions of "machine computation" and "effectively calculable".

:"A function is said to be "effectively calculable" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematically expressible definition. Such a definition was first given by [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] at Princeton in 1934 ... . These functions are described as "general recursive" by Gödel ... .  Another definition of effective calculability has been given by Church ... who identifies it with λ-definability. The author has recently suggested a definition corresponding more closely to the intuitive idea (Turing [1], see also [[Emil Leon Post|Post's]] [1]). It was stated above that '''"a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process". We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine'''. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to '''the author's definition of a computable function''', and to '''an identification of computability † with effective calculability'''. It is not difficult, though somewhat laborious, to prove that these three definitions are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene [3], Turing [2]&lt;/ref&gt;
::"† We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions. We do not restrict the values taken by a computable function to be natural numbers; we may for instance have computable [[propositional function]]s."&lt;ref&gt;boldface added, Turing 1939 in (Davis 1965:160)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a powerful expression. because "identicality" is actually an unequivocal statement of necessary and sufficient conditions, in other words there are no other contingencies to the identification" except what interpretation is given to the words "function", "machine", "computable", and "effectively calculable":
:: For all functions: IF "this function is computable by machine" THEN "this function is effectively calculable" AND IF "this function is effectively calculable" THEN "this function is computable by a machine."

==Rosser: recursion, λ-calculus, and Turing-machine computation identity==
J. B. Rosser's paper ''An Informal Exposition of Proofs of Gödel's Theorem and Church's Theorem''&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:223-230)&lt;/ref&gt; states the following:

:"'Effective method' is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The simplest of these to state (due to [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and [[Alan Turing|Turing]]) says essentially that an effective method of solving a certain set of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer. All three definitions are equivalent, so it does not matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.

::&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; One definition is given by [[Alonzo Church|Church]] in I [i.e. Church 1936 ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number theory'']. Another definition is due to [[Jacques Herbrand]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. It is stated in I, footnote 3, p. 346. The third definition was given independently in two slightly different forms by E. L. Post ... and A. M. Turing ... . The first two definitions are proved equivalent in I. The third is proved equivalent to the first two by A. M. Turing, ''Computability and λ-definability'' [''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', vol. 2 (1937), pp. 153-163]." &lt;ref&gt;quote and footnote from Rosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:225-226)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleene and ''Thesis I''==
[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] defines "general recursive" functions and "partial recursive functions" in his paper ''Recursive Predicates and Quantifiers''. The representing function, mu-operator, etc make their appearance. He goes on in §12 ''Algorithm theories'' to state his famous Thesis I, what he would come to call '''[[Church–Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]''' in 1952:

:"This heuristic fact, as well as certain reflections on the nature of symbolic algorithmic processes, led [[Alonzo Church|Church]] to state the following thesis&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;. The same thesis is implicitly in [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] description of computing machines&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.

::"''Thesis I. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive.''

:"Since a precise mathematical definition of the term effectively calculable (effectively decidable) has been wanting, we can take this thesis, together with the principle already accepted to which it is converse, as a definition of it ... the thesis has the character of an hypothesis – a point emphasized by [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and by Church&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;.
:::&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Church [1] [''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'']&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936a in (Davis 1965:88ff)&lt;/ref&gt;
:::&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Turing [1] [''On Computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem''(1936)]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}, in (Davis 1965:115ff)&lt;/ref&gt;
:::&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Post [1, p. 105],&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1936, ''Finite combinatory processes - Formulation 1'', The Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 1, No. 3 (Sep., 1936), pp. 103-105&lt;/ref&gt; and Church [2]  &lt;ref&gt;Church, 1938, ''The constructive second number class'', Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. vol. 44, Number 4, 1938, pp. 224-232]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kleene and Church and Turing theses==
In his chapter §60, [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] defines the "[[Church–Turing thesis|Church's thesis]]" as follows:
:" ... heuristic evidence and other considerations led [[Alonzo Church|Church]] 1936 to propose the following thesis.
::"Thesis I. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive.
:"This thesis is also implicit in the conception of a computing machine formulated by [[Alan Turing|Turing]] 1936-7 and Post 1936."&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:300-301)&lt;/ref&gt;

On page 317 he ''explicitly'' calls the above thesis "Church's thesis":
:"§'''62. Church's thesis'''. One of the main objectives of this and the next chapter is to present the evidence for Church's thesis (Thesis I §60)." &lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:317)&lt;/ref&gt;

About Turing's "formulation", Kleene says:
:"Turing's formulation hence constitutes an independent statement of Church's thesis (in equivalent terms). [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] 1936 gave a similar formulation."&lt;ref&gt;Post 1936:321&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleene proposes that what Turing showed: "Turing's computable functions (1936-1937) are those which can be computed by a machine of a kind which is designed, according to his analysis, to reproduce all the sorts of operations which a human computer could perform, working according to preassigned instructions." &lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952 in (Davis 1965:321)&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation of Turing plays into [[Robin Gandy|Gandy's]] concern that a machine specification may not explicitly "reproduce all the sorts of operations which a human computer could perform" – i.e. his two examples are (i) massively symbol-parallel computation and two-dimensional computation e.g. [[Conway's Game of Life|Conway's "game of life"]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Gandy 1978 in (Barwise et al 1980:125)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore there may be processes that can "compute more" than a [[Turing machine]] can. See 1980 below.

Kleene defines Turing's Thesis as follows:
:"§'''70. Turing's thesis'''. Turing's thesis that every function which would naturally be regarded as computable under his definition, i.e. by one of his machines, is equivalent to Church's thesis by Theorem XXX."

Indeed immediately before this statement, Kleene states the Theorem XXX:
::"Theorem XXX (= Theorems XXVIII + XXIX). The following classes of partial functions are coextensive, i.e. have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions, (c) the 1/1 computable functions. Similarly with l [lower-case L] completely defined assumed functions Ψ."

==Gödel, Turing machines, and effectively calculability==
To his 1931 paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions'', [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]] added a ''Note added 28 August 1963'' which clarifies his opinion of the alternative forms/expression of "a [[formal system]]". He reiterates his opinions even more clearly in 1964 (see below):

:"''Note Added 28 August 1963''. In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that due to [[Alan Turing|A. M. Turing's]] work&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt; a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt; can now be given, a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible. That is, it can be proved rigorously that in every consistent formal system that contains a certain amount of finitary number theory there exist undecidable arithmetic propositions and that, moreover, the consistency of any such system cannot be proved in the system.

::"&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt; See ''{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}'', p. 249.

:::"&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt; In my opinion the term "formal system" or "formalism" should never be used for anything but this notion. In a lecture at Princeton (mentioned in ''Princeton University 1946'', p. 11 [see Davis 1965, pp. 84-88 [i.e. Davis p. 84-88] ]), I suggested certain transfinite generalizations of formalisms, but these are something radically different from formal systems in the proper sense of the term, whose characteristic property is that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1963 in (van Heijenoort 1976:616)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gödel 1964''' – In Gödel's ''Postscriptum'' to his lecture's notes of 1934 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study|IAS at Princeton]],&lt;ref&gt;Due to the language difference, Gödel refers to the IAS as "AIS"&lt;/ref&gt; he repeats, but reiterates in even more bold terms, his less-than-glowing opinion about the efficacy of computability as defined by [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] λ-definability and recursion (we have to infer that both are denigrated because of his use of the plural "definitions" in the following). This was in a letter to Martin Davis (presumably as he was assembling ''The Undecidable''). The repeat of some of the phrasing is striking:

:"In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact, that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given, the existence of undecidable arithmetical propositions and the non-demonstrability of the consistence of a system in the same system can now be proved rigorously for ''every'' consistent formal system containing a certain amount of finitary number theory.

:"Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of "mechanical procedure" (alias "algorithm" or "computation procedure" or "finite combinatorial procedure"). This concept is shown to be equivalent to that of a "[[Turing machine]]".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas ... the concept of formal system, whose essence it is that reasoning is completely replaced by mechanical operations on formulas. (Note that the question of whether there exist finite ''non-mechanical'' procedures ... not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of "formal system" and of "mechanical procedure.

:"... if "finite procedure" is understood to mean "mechanical procedure", the question raised in footnote 3 can be answered affirmatively for recursiveness as defined in §9, which is equivalent to general recursiveness as defined today (see S. C. Kleene (1936) ...)" &lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:71-73)&lt;/ref&gt;

::" * See {{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} ... and the almost simultaneous paper by [[Emil Leon Post|E. L. Post]] (1936) ... . As for previous equivalent definitions of computability, which however, are much less suitable for our purpose, see A. Church 1936 ..."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:72)&lt;/ref&gt;

Footnote 3 is in the body of the 1934 lecture notes:
:"&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The converse seems to be true, if besides recursions according to the scheme (2) recursions of other forms (e.g., with respect to two variables simultaneously) are admitted. This cannot be proved, since the notion of finite computation is not defined, but it serves as a heuristic principle."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis does observe that "in fact the equivalence between his [Gödel's] definition [of recursion] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene's]] [1936] is not quite trivial. So, despite appearances to the contrary, footnote 3 of these lectures is not a statement of [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's thesis]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1934 in (Davis 1967:40)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gandy: "machine computation", discrete, deterministic, and limited to "local causation" by light speed==

[[Robin Gandy]]'s influential paper titled ''Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms'' appears in [[Jon Barwise|Barwise]] et al. Gandy starts off with an unlikely expression of [[Church–Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]], framed as follows:

:"1. Introduction
:"Throughout this paper we shall use "calculable" to refer to some intuitively given notion and "computable" to mean "computable by a [[Turing machine]]"; of course many equivalent definitions of "computable" are now available.
:"''Church's Thesis. What is effectively calculable is computable.''
:" ... Both Church and Turing had in mind calculation by an abstract human being using some mechanical aids (such as paper and pencil)"&lt;ref&gt;Gandy in (Barwise 1980:123)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Soare]] (1995, see below) had issues with this framing, considering [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] paper (1936) published prior to [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] "Appendix proof" (1937).

Gandy attempts to "analyze mechanical processes and so to provide arguments for the following:
:"Thesis M. What can be calculated by a machine is computable." &lt;ref&gt;Gandy in (Barwise 1980:124&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandy "exclude[s] from consideration devices which are essentially analogue machines ... .The only physical presuppositions made about mechanical devices (Cf Principle IV below) are that there is a lower bound on the linear dimensions of every atomic part of the device and that there is an upper bound (the velocity of light) on the speed of propagation of change".&lt;ref name=Gandy126&gt;Gandy in (Barwise 1980:126)&lt;/ref&gt; But then he restricts his machines even more:
:"(2) Secondly we suppose that the progress of calculation by a mechanical device may be described in discrete terms, so that the devices considered are, in a loose sense, digital computers.
:"(3) Lasty we suppose that the device is deterministic: that is, the subsequent behavior of the device is uniquely determined once a complete description of its initial state is given."&lt;ref name="Gandy126"/&gt;

He in fact makes an argument for this "Thesis M" that he calls his "Theorem", the most important "Principle" of which is "Principle IV: Principle of local causation":
:"Now we come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depended only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the ''principle of local causation.'' Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance."&lt;ref&gt;Gandy in (Barwise 1980:135)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soare==
[[Robert Soare|Soare]]'s thorough examination of ''Computability and Recursion'' appears. He quotes [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] 1964 opinion (above) with respect to the "much less suitable" definition of computability, and goes on to add:
:"[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] wrote [1981b, p. 49], "[[Alan Turing|Turing's]] computability is intrinsically persuasive" but "λ-definability is not intrinsically persuasive" and "general recursiveness scarcely so (its author Gödel being at the time not at all persuaded) ... . Most people today accept Turing's Thesis"&lt;ref&gt;Soare 1996:13&lt;/ref&gt;

Soare's footnote 7 (1995) also catches [[Robin Gandy|Gandy's]] "confusion", but apparently it continues into Gandy (1988). This confusion represents a serious error of research and/or thought and remains a cloud hovering over his whole program:
:"&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Gandy actually wrote "Church's thesis" not "Turing's thesis" as written here, but surely Gandy meant the latter, at least intensionally, because Turing did not prove anything in 1936 or anywhere else about general recursive functions."&lt;ref&gt;Soare 1996:11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breger and problem of tacit axioms==
Breger points out a problem when one is approaching a notion "axiomatically", that is, an "axiomatic system" may have imbedded in it one or more ''tacit'' axioms that are unspoken when the axiom-set is presented.

For example, an active agent with knowledge (and capability) may be a (potential) fundamental axiom in any axiomatic system: "the know-how of a human being is necessary – a know-how which is not formalized in the axioms. ¶ ... Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how with the symbols is impossible ..."&lt;ref&gt;Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:221)&lt;/ref&gt;

He quotes [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]:
: "In a university lecture given in 1905, Hilbert considered it "absolutely necessary" to have an "axiom of thought" or "an axiom of the existence of an intelligence" before stating the axioms in logic. In the margin of the script, Hilbert added later: "the a priori of the philosophers." He formulated this axiom as follows: "I have the capacity to think of objects, and to denote them by means of simple symbols like ''a, b,..., x, y,...,'' so that they can be recognized unambiguously. My thought operates with these objects in a certain way according to certain rules, and my thinking is able to detect these rules by observation of myself, and completely to describe these rules" [(Hilbert 1905,219); see also (Peckhaus 1990, 62f and 227)]."&lt;ref&gt;brackets and references in original, Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:227)&lt;/ref&gt;

Breger further supports his argument with examples from [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) and [[Hermann Weyl]] (1930-1). He goes on to discuss the problem of then expression of an axiom-set in a particular language: i.e. a language known by the agent, e.g. German.&lt;ref&gt;Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, Breger gives a potent example of this in his paper (Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228-118))&lt;/ref&gt;

See more about this at [[Algorithm characterizations]], in particular [[John R. Searle|Searle]]'s opinion that outside any computation there must be an observer that gives meaning to the symbols used.

==Sieg and axiomatic definitions==
At the "Feferfest" – [[Solomon Feferman|Solomon Feferman's]] 70th birthday – [[Wilfried Sieg]] first presents a paper written two years earlier titled "Calculations By Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis", reprinted in (Sieg et al. 2002:390–409). Earlier Sieg published "Mechanical Procedures and Mathematical Experience"  (in George 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;71ff) presenting a history of "calculability" beginning &lt;!-- (approximately) --&gt; with [[Richard Dedekind]] and ending in the 1950s &lt;!-- (approximately) --&gt; with the later papers of [[Alan Turing]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]].  The Feferfest paper distills the prior paper to its major points and dwells primarily on [[Robin Gandy]]'s paper of 1980. Sieg extends Turing's "computability by string machine" (human "computor") as reduced to mechanism "computability by letter machine"&lt;ref&gt;Turing's thesis – cf drawing p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''parallel'' machines of Gandy.

Sieg cites more recent work including "Kolmogorov and Uspensky's work on algorithms" and (De Pisapia 2000), in particular, the [[Pointer machine|KU-pointer machine-model]]), and [[artificial neural network]]s&lt;ref name=Sieg399&gt;Sieig 2002:399&lt;/ref&gt; and asserts:
:"The separation of informal conceptual analysis and mathematical equivalence proof is essential for recognizing that the correctness of ''Turing's Thesis'' (taken generically) rests on two pillars; namely on the correctness of boundedness and locality conditions for computors, and on the correctness of the pertinent central thesis. The latter asserts explicitly that computations of a computor can be mimicked directly by a particular kind of machine. However satisfactory one may find this line of analytic argument, there are two weak spots: the looseness of the restrictive conditions (What are symbolic configurations? What changes can mechanical operations effect?) and the corresponding vagueness of the central thesis. We are, no matter how we turn ourselves, in a position that is methodologically still unsatisfactory ... ."&lt;ref name=Sieg399/&gt;

He claims to "step toward a more satisfactory stance ... [by] abstracting further away from particular types of configurations and operations ..."&lt;ref name=Sieg399/&gt;
:"It has been claimed frequently that Turing analyzed computations of machines. That is historically and systematically inaccurate, as my exposition should have made quite clear. Only in 1980 did Turing's student, Robin Gandy, characterize machine computations."&lt;ref name=Sieg399/&gt;

Whether the above statement is true or not is left to the reader to ponder. Sieg goes on to describe Gandy's analysis (see above 1980). In doing so he attempts to formalize what he calls "[[Gandy machine]]s" (with a detailed analysis in an Appendix). About the Gandy machines:
:"&lt;!-- Let me bring out the central points for Gandy machines. First, --&gt; ... the definition of a Gandy machine is an "abstract" mathematical definition that embodies &lt;!-- generally accepted --&gt;... properties of parallel computations&lt;!-- &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; ... Second, Gandy machines share with groups and topological spaces the general feature of '''abstract axiomatic definitions''', namely, that they '''admit a wide variety of different interpretations'''. Third, &lt;!-- the central fact, that --&gt;... the computations of any Gandy machine can be simulated by a letter machine, [and] is best understood as a representation theorem for the axiomatic notion. [boldface added]

&lt;!-- ::"&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;In (Lamport and Lynch) it is asserted that "the theory of sequential computing rests upon fundamental concepts of computability that are independent of any particular computational model." In contrast, it is claimed, no such fundamental concepts underlying distributed computing have yet been developed. That is followed by some informal observations (p. 1166): "Underlying almost all models of concurrent systems is the assumption that an execution consists of a set of discrete events, each affecting only part of the system's state. Events are grouped into processes, each process being a more or less completely sequenced set of events sharing some common locality in terms of what part of the state they affect. For a collection of autonomous processes to act as a coherent system, the processes must be synchronized ... .
 --&gt;
:"The axiomatic approach captures the essential nature of computation processes in an abstract way. The difference between the two types of calculators I have been describing is reduced to the fact that Turing computors modify one bounded part of a state, whereas Gandy machines operate in parallel on arbitrarily many bounded parts. The representation theorems guarantee that models of the axioms are computationally equivalent to [[Turing machines]] in their letter variety."&lt;ref&gt;Sieg 2002:404&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hormesis''' is any process in a cell or organism that exhibits a [[phase (pharmacology)|biphasic]] response to exposure to increasing amounts of a substance or condition.&lt;ref name="mattson"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2248601|year=2007|last1=Mattson|first1=M. P|title=Hormesis Defined|journal=Ageing Research Reviews|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.08.007|pmid=18162444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the '''hormetic zone''', there is generally a favorable biological response to low exposures to [[toxin]]s and other [[stressor]]s. Hormesis comes from Greek ''hórmēsis'' "rapid motion, eagerness", itself from ancient Greek ''hormáein'' "to set in motion, impel, urge on". Hormetics is the term proposed for the study and science of hormesis.

In [[toxicology]], hormesis is a [[dose response]] phenomenon characterized by a low dose stimulation, high dose inhibition, resulting in either a J-shaped or an inverted U-shaped dose response.&lt;ref name=mattson/&gt; Such environmental factors that would seem to produce positive responses have also been termed "[[eustress]]". The hormesis model of dose response is vigorously debated.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; The notion that hormesis is important for chemical risks regulations is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15473091 |year=2004 |last1=Axelrod |first1=Deborah |last2=Burns |first2=Kathy |last3=Davis |first3=Devra |last4=von Larebeke |first4=Nicolas |title='Hormesis'—An Inappropriate Extrapolation from the Specific to the Universal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=335–9 |journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1077-3525&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=335&amp;epage=339 |hdl=1854/LU-867581 |doi=10.1179/oeh.2004.10.3.335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biochemical mechanisms by which hormesis works remain under laboratory research and are not well understood.&lt;ref name=mattson/&gt;

==History==
German [[pharmacologist]] [[Hugo Schulz]] first described such a phenomenon in 1888 following his own observations that the growth of yeast could be stimulated by small doses of poisons. This was coupled with the work of German physician [[Rudolph Arndt]], who studied animals given low doses of drugs, eventually giving rise to the [[Arndt-Schulz rule]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.302.5644.376 |title=Sipping from a Poisoned Chalice |year=2003 |last1=Kaiser |first1=Jocelyn |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5644 |pages=376–9 |pmid=14563981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arndt's advocacy of [[homeopathy]] contributed to the rule's diminished credibility in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"/&gt; The term "hormesis" was coined and used for the first time in a scientific paper by [[Chester M. Southam]] and J. Ehrlich in 1943 in the journal: Phytopathology, volume 33, pp.&amp;nbsp;517–541.
Recently, [[Edward Calabrese]] has revived the concept of hormesis.&lt;ref name="Calabrese"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400222 |title=Hormesis: A revolution in toxicology, risk assessment and medicine |year=2004 |last1=Calabrese |first1=Edward J. |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |pages=S37–40 |pmid=15459733 |pmc=1299203 |issue=Suppl 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calabrese 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bethell | first = Tom | title = The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science | publisher = Regnery Publishing | location = USA | pages = 58–61 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xX4m7s7_4L0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA58,M1 | isbn = 978-0-89526-031-4 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Physical exercise===
Individuals with low levels of physical activity are at risk for high levels of [[oxidative stress]], as are individuals engaged in highly intensive exercise programs; however individuals engaged in moderately intensive, regular exercise experience lower levels of oxidative stress. High levels of oxidative stress have been linked by some with the increased incidence of a variety of diseases.&lt;ref name=pmid17869589&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.04.004 |title=Exercise, oxidative stress and hormesis |year=2008 |last1=Radak |first1=Zsolt |last2=Chung |first2=Hae Y. |last3=Koltai |first3=Erika |last4=Taylor |first4=Albert W. |last5=Goto |first5=Sataro |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |pages=34–42 |pmid=17869589 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that this relationship, characterized by positive effects at an intermediate dose of the stressor (exercise), is characteristic of hormesis.&lt;ref name=pmid17869589/&gt; However, it is important to point out that there is evidence that the oxidative stress associated with intensive exercise may have long-term health benefits. This would imply that oxidative stress, itself, provides an example of hormesis (see section on [[Mitochondrial hormesis]]), but physical exercise does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.03.014 |title=How increased oxidative stress promotes longevity and metabolic health: The concept of mitochondrial hormesis (mitohormesis) |year=2010 |last1=Ristow |first1=Michael |last2=Zarse |first2=Kim |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=410–8 |pmid=20350594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethanol|Alcohol]] is believed to be hormetic in preventing heart disease and stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.8606 |title=The Importance of Hormesis to Public Health |year=2006 |last1=Calabrese |first1=Edward J. |last2=Cook |first2=Ralph |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |pmid=17107845 |jstor=4091789 |volume=114 |issue=11 |pages=1631–5 |pmc=1665397}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the benefits of light drinking may have been exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/16066350500497983 |laysource=[[University of California, San Francisco]] |laysummary=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/uoc--isq032706.php |laydate=March 30, 2006 |title=Moderate alcohol use and reduced mortality risk: Systematic error in prospective studies |year=2006 |last1=Fillmore |first1=Kaye Middleton |last2=Kerr |first2=William C. |last3=Stockwell |first3=Tim |last4=Chikritzhs |first4=Tanya |last5=Bostrom |first5=Alan |journal=Addiction Research &amp; Theory |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2007.01.005 |title=Moderate Alcohol Use and Reduced Mortality Risk: Systematic Error in Prospective Studies and New Hypotheses |year=2007 |last1=Fillmore |first1=Kaye Middleton |last2=Stockwell |first2=Tim |last3=Chikritzhs |first3=Tanya |last4=Bostrom |first4=Alan |last5=Kerr |first5=William |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=S16–23 |pmid=17478320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, researchers at UCLA found that tiny amounts (1 mM, or 0.005%) of ethanol doubled the lifespan of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a round worm frequently used in biological studies, that were starved of other nutrients. Higher doses of 0.4% provided no longevity benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029984 |title=Caenorhabditis elegans Battling Starvation Stress: Low Levels of Ethanol Prolong Lifespan in L1 Larvae |year=2012 |editor1-last=Singh |editor1-first=Shree Ram |last1=Castro |first1=Paola V. |last2=Khare |first2=Shilpi |last3=Young |first3=Brian D. |last4=Clarke |first4=Steven G. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |pages=e29984 |pmid=22279556 |issue=1 |pmc=3261173 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...7E9984C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, worms exposed to 0.005% did not develop normally (their development was arrested). The authors argue that the worms were using ethanol as an alternative energy source in the absence of other nutrition, or had initiated a stress response. They did not test the effect of ethanol on worms fed a normal diet.

===Methylmercury and mallard eggs===
In 2010, a paper published in the journal ''Environmental Toxicology &amp; Chemistry'' showed that low doses of [[methylmercury]], a potent neurotoxic pollutant, improved the hatching rate of [[mallard]] eggs.&lt;ref name=pmid20821490&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/etc.64 |laysummary=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/56954/title/Fowl_surprise!_Methylmercury_improves_hatching_rate |laysource=Science News |laydate=March 5, 2010 |title=Enhanced reproduction in mallards fed a low level of methylmercury: An apparent case of hormesis |year=2010 |last1=Heinz |first1=Gary H. |last2=Hoffman |first2=David J. |last3=Klimstra |first3=Jon D. |last4=Stebbins |first4=Katherine R. |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=650–3 |pmid=20821490|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229166 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study, Gary Heinz, who led the study for the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] at the [[Patuxent Wildlife Research Center]] in [[Beltsville]], Md., stated that other explanations are possible. For instance, it is possible that the flock he studied might have harbored some low, subclinical infection and that mercury, well known to be antimicrobial, might have killed the infection that otherwise hurt reproduction in the untreated birds.&lt;ref name=pmid20821490/&gt;

===Effects in aging===
One of the areas where the concept of hormesis has been explored extensively with respect to its applicability is aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Le Bourg |editor2-first=Suresh |editor2-last=Rattan |editor2-link=Suresh Rattan |title=Mild Stress and Healthy Aging: Applying hormesis in aging research and interventions |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-6868-3}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0960327107083409 |title=Principles and practice of hormetic treatment of aging and age-related diseases |year=2008 |last1=Rattan |first1=S. I. |journal=Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=151–4 |pmid=18480141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the basic survival capacity of any biological system depends on its [[homeostatic]] ability, [[biogerontologist]]s proposed that exposing cells and organisms to mild stress should result in the adaptive or hormetic response with various biological benefits. This idea has now gathered a large body of supportive evidence showing that repetitive mild stress exposure has anti-aging effects.&lt;ref name="Rattan, S.I.S 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.03.002 |title=Hormesis in aging |year=2008 |last1=Rattan |first1=Suresh I.S. |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |pages=63–78 |pmid=17964227 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gems"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2008.01.001 |title=Stress-Response Hormesis and Aging: "That which Does Not Kill Us Makes Us Stronger" |year=2008 |last1=Gems |first1=David |last2=Partridge |first2=Linda |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=200–3 |pmid=18316025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise is a paradigm for hormesis in this respect.&lt;ref name = "Gems"/&gt; Some of the mild stresses used for such studies on the application of hormesis in aging research and interventions are [[heat shock]], irradiation, [[Pro-oxidant|prooxidants]], [[hypergravity]] and food restriction.&lt;ref name="Rattan, S.I.S 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gems"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Le Bourg |editor2-last=Rattan |title=Mild Stress and Healthy Aging: Applying hormesis in aging research and interventions |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-6868-3}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other natural and synthetic molecules, such as [[celastrol]]s from medicinal herbs and [[curcumin]] from the spice [[turmeric]] have also been found to have hormetic beneficial effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1196/annals.1354.056 |title=Curcumin's Biphasic Hormetic Response on Proteasome Activity and Heat-Shock Protein Synthesis in Human Keratinocytes |year=2006 |last1=Ali |first1=R.

===Mitochondria{{anchor|Mitohormesis}}===
[[Mitochondria]] are sometimes described as "cellular power plants" because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a source of chemical energy. [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) have been regarded as unwanted by-products of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in mitochondria by the proponents of the free-radical theory of aging promoted by [[Denham Harman]]. The [[free-radical theory]] suggests that the use of compounds which inactivate ROS, such as [[antioxidant]]s, would lead to a reduction of oxidative stress and thereby produce an increase in lifespan.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

ROS may perform an essential and potentially lifespan-promoting role as [[redox signaling]] molecules which transduce signals from the mitochondrial compartment to other compartments of the cell.&lt;ref name="pmid 20350594"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20350594 |year=2010 |last1=Ristow |first1=M |last2=Zarse |first2=K |title=How increased oxidative stress promotes longevity and metabolic health: The concept of mitochondrial hormesis (mitohormesis) |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=410–8 |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.03.014 |journal=Experimental Gerontology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased formation of ROS within the mitochondria may cause an adaptive reaction which produces increased stress resistance and a long-term reduction of oxidative stress. This kind of reverse effect of the response to ROS stress has been named mitochondrial hormesis or mitohormesis and is hypothesized to be responsible for the respective lifespan-extending and health-promoting capabilities of glucose restriction and physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid 20350594"/&gt;

Hormesis may also be induced by [[endogenous]]ly produced, potentially toxic agents. For example, [[mitochondria]] consume [[oxygen]] which generates [[free radical]]s ([[reactive oxygen species]]) as a by-product. It was previously proposed on a hypothetical basis that such free radicals may induce an endogenous response culminating in increased defense capacity against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.009 |title=Sublethal mitochondrial stress with an attendant stoichiometric augmentation of reactive oxygen species may precipitate many of the beneficial alterations in cellular physiology produced by caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary phytonutrients: "Mitohormesis" for health and vitality |year=2006 |last1=Tapia |first1=Patrick C. |journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=832–43 |pmid=16242247}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Recent experimental evidence strongly suggests that this is indeed the case, and that such induction of endogenous free radical production extends [[life expectancy|life span]] of a model organism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pinto |first1=Silas |last2=Sato |first2=Vitor N. |last3=De-Souza |first3=Evandro A. |last4=Ferraz |first4=Rafael C. |last5=Camara |first5=Henrique |last6=Pinca |first6=Ana Paula F. |last7=Mazzotti |first7=Diego R. |last8=Lovci |first8=Michael T. |last9=Tonon |first9=Guilherme |last10=Lopes-Ramos |first10=Camila M. |last11=Parmigiani |first11=Raphael B. |last12=Wurtele |first12=Martin |last13=Massirer |first13=Katlin B. |last14=Mori |first14=Marcelo A. |title=Enoxacin extends lifespan of  C. elegans  by inhibiting  miR-34-5p  and promoting mitohormesis |journal=Redox Biology |date=September 2018 |volume=18 |pages=84–92 |doi=10.1016/j.redox.2018.06.006|pmid=29986212 |pmc=6037660 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most importantly, this extension of life span is prevented by [[antioxidant]]s, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.08.011 |title=Glucose Restriction Extends Caenorhabditis elegans Life Span by Inducing Mitochondrial Respiration and Increasing Oxidative Stress |year=2007 |last1=Schulz |first1=Tim J. |last2=Zarse |first2=Kim |last3=Voigt |first3=Anja |last4=Urban |first4=Nadine |last5=Birringer |first5=Marc |last6=Ristow |first6=Michael |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=280–93 |pmid=17908557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mitochondrial activity was found to be increased in the previously mentioned studies, this effect cannot be explained by an excess of free radicals that might mark mitochondria for destruction by [[lysosome]]s, with the free radicals acting as a signal within the cell to indicate which mitochondria are ready for destruction, as proposed by [[Nick Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lane | first = Nick | authorlink = Nick Lane | title = Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = November 17, 2006 | isbn = 978-0-19-920564-6 }}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether this concept applies to humans remains to be shown, although recent [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] findings support the process of mitohormesis, and even suggest that some [[antioxidant]] supplements may increase disease [[prevalence]] in humans.&lt;ref name=Bjelakovic&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |title=Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis |year=2007 |last1=Bjelakovic |first1=Goran |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |pmid=17327526 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ionizing radiation{{anchor|Ionizing Radiation}}===
{{see also|Radiation hormesis}}
Hormesis has been observed in a number of cases in humans and animals exposed to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation. In Taiwan recycled [[Radiation contamination|radiocontaminated]] steel was inadvertently used in the construction of over 100 apartment buildings causing the long-term (10 years) exposure of 10,000 people. The average dose rate was 50 mSv/year and a subset of the population (1,000 people) received a total dose of over 4,000 mSv over ten years. In the widely used [[Linear no-threshold model|Linear No Threshold]] (LNT) theory used by regulatory bodies, the expected cancer deaths in this population would have been 302 with 70 caused by the extra ionizing radiation with the remainder caused by natural background radiation. However the observed cancer rate was quite low at 7 cancer deaths when 232 would be predicted by the LNT theory. Ionizing radiation hormesis appears to be at work. Described by Professor Charles L. Sanders, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sanders |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles L. Sanders |title=Radiation Hormesis and the Linear-No-Threshold Assumption |journal=Radiation Hormesis and the Linear-No-Threshold Assumption by Charles L Sanders |date=2010 |isbn=978-3-642-03719-1 |page=47|bibcode=2010rhln.book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan's National Cancer Registry (first study) ====
Cancer risks in a population with prolonged low dose-rate gamma-radiation exposure in radiocontaminated buildings, 1983–2002. The results suggest that prolonged low dose-rate radiation exposure appeared to increase risks of developing certain cancers in specific subgroups of this population in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hwang SL, Guo HR, Hsieh WA, Hwang JS, Lee SD, Tang JL, Chen CC, Chang TC, Wang JD, Chang WP |title=Cancer risks in a population with prolonged low dose-rate gamma-radiation exposure in radiocontaminated buildings, 1983-2002 |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=849–58 |year=2006 |pmid=17178625 |doi=10.1080/09553000601085980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan's National Cancer Registry (second study, two years later) ====
A significant radiation risk was observed for leukemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR(100mGy) 1.19, 90% CI 1.01-1.31). Breast cancer exhibited a marginally significant dose response (HR(100mGy) 1.12, 90% CI 0.99-1.21). The results further strengthen the association between protracted low-dose radiation and cancer risks, especially for breast cancers and leukemia, in this unique cohort population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hwang SL, Hwang JS, Yang YT, Hsieh WA, Chang TC, Guo HR, Tsai MH, Tang JL, Lin IF, Chang WP |title=Estimates of relative risks for cancers in a population after prolonged low-dose-rate radiation exposure: a follow-up assessment from 1983 to 2005 |journal=Radiation Research |volume=170 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18666807 |doi=10.1667/RR0732.1 |bibcode=2008RadR..170..143H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical and ionizing radiation combined{{anchor|Combined effects}}===
No experiment can be performed in perfect isolation. Thick lead shielding around a chemical dose experiment to rule out the effects of ionizing radiation is built and rigorously controlled for in the laboratory, and certainly not the field. Likewise the same applies for ionizing radiation studies. Ionizing radiation is released when an unstable particle releases radiation, creating two new substances and energy in the form of an [[electromagnetic wave]]. The resulting materials are then free to interact with any environmental elements, and the energy released can also be used as a catalyst in further ionizing radiation interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs371/en/|title=Ionizing radiation, health effects and protective measures|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting confusion in the low dose exposure field (radiation and chemical) arise from lack of consideration of this concept as described by Mothersill and Seymory.&lt;ref name=Mothersill&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mothersill C, Seymour C |title=Implications for environmental health of multiple stressors |journal=Journal of Radiological Protection |volume=29 |issue=2A |pages=A21–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19454807 |doi=10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S02 |bibcode = 2009JRP....29...21M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothersill and Seymory state "Most of the arguments about whether radiation is 'good for you' or 'bad for you' fail due to lack of consideration of the hierarchical level at which the effect occurs and because most of the arguments are [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]]. For example cell death is seen as a 'bad' effect but if it removes a potentially carcinogenic cell from the population of cells in a tissue it could prevent cancer starting and could be seen as 'good'."{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Controversy==
Whether hormesis is common or important is controversial. At least one peer-reviewed article accepts the idea, claiming that over 600 substances show a U-shaped [[dose-response]] relationship. Calaberese and Baldwin wrote: "One percent (195 out of 20,285) of the published articles contained 668 dose-response relationships that met the entry criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calabrese EJ, Baldwin LA |title=The frequency of U-shaped dose responses in the toxicological literature |journal=Toxicological Sciences |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=330–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11452146 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/62.2.330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that low dose effects may be (sometimes strikingly) different is accepted, but that the low dose effect is positive is questionable.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The hypothesis of hormesis has generated the most controversy when applied to [[ionizing radiation]]. This theory is called [[radiation hormesis]]. For policy making purposes, the commonly accepted model of dose response in radiobiology is the [[linear no-threshold]] model (LNT), which assumes a strictly linear dependence between the risk of radiation-induced adverse health effects and radiation dose.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The [[United States National Research Council]] (part of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, National Research Council |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog/11340.html |title=Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2 |year=2005 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-09156-5}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]])&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-929600-69-7"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ncrppublications.org/index.cfm?fm=Product.AddToCart&amp;pid=6714063164 |title=Evaluation of the Linear-Nonthreshold Dose-Response Model for Ionizing Radiation |publisher=National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-929600-69-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Ionizing Radiation (UNSCEAR) all agree that radiation hormesis is not clearly shown, nor clearly the rule for radiation doses.

A report commissioned by the French National Academy concluded that there is sufficient evidence for hormesis occurring at low doses and that LNT should be reconsidered as the methodology used to estimate risks from low level sources of radiation, like [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]] for [[nuclear waste]].&lt;ref name="french"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.06.013 |title=Dose–effect relationship and estimation of the carcinogenic effects of low doses of ionizing radiation: The joint report of the Académie des Sciences (Paris) and of the Académie Nationale de Médecine |year=2005 |last1=Tubiana |first1=Maurice |journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=317–9 |pmid=16168825}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the United States-based [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] states that there is insufficient evidence for radiation hormesis and that radiation protection authorities should continue to apply the LNT model for purposes of risk estimation.&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-929600-69-7"/&gt;

This should be moved to Radiation hormesis; however it would be good to find another source, since the NRCP report is not freely available and I can't verify what exactly it says about RH.

They conclude that the [[linear no threshold model]] that is effective at high doses, and which predicts that the chance of causing cancer is always linearly proportional to the amount of radiation an individual receives, should be used at low doses too. The report squarely rejects almost all research showing radiation induced hormesis as being flawed in some way (e.g. the cancer a study focuses on does not exist in humans, a clear threshold could not be established in humans, the assumptions are seriously flawed, the hormetic effect is too short to be useful).

Radiation hormesis is not generally accepted by The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), its U.S. counterpart, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), the National Research Council Committees on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (the BEIR Committees), or the U.S. regulatory agencies.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q299.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{dead link}} "Information on hormesis"]. Health Physics Society.  Retrieved 26-Feb-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|note: that ref is dead, and this: http://hps.org/documents/risk_ps010-1.pdf indicates that HPS does not accept LNT for estimation of risk for low doses; the document says that )

Reasons include:
*No well-documented long-term positive effects of hormetic concentrations of toxins.
*Hormesis is counterintuitive.
*Concern about [[publication bias]]; studies that show positive effects might be more likely to be published.
*While some toxins might indeed have different effects at low doses, it is not clear if the effects tend to be positive.}}
--&gt;

==Policy consequences==
Regulatory agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) traditionally use a [[linear no-threshold model]] for carcinogens (including radiation). In the linear model, the assumption is that there is no dosage that has no risk of causing cancer. While this linear approach remains the default {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}, with sufficient [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanistic evidence]] suggesting a non-linear dose-response, EPA allows for the derivation of a threshold dose (also known as reference dose) below which it is assumed that there is no risk for cancer.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

While proponents of hormesis argue that changing to a hormesis model would likely change exposure standards for these toxicants in [[air]], [[water]], [[food]] and [[soil]], making the standards less strict, other scientists point out that low dose stimulation can have extremely adverse effects. Similarly, low doses of the [[phthalate]] [[DEHP]] cause increased allergic responses to [[allergen]]s, while higher doses have no effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Wider use of the hormesis model would affect how scientists design and conduct studies and the selection of models that estimate risk. In all likelihood, recognizing that low dose effects can't be predicted from high dose experiments would force a strengthening of public health standards, not their weakening, as hormesis proponents would argue.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Hormesis remains largely unknown to the public. Any policy change ought to consider hormesis first as a public health issue (versus an industrial regulatory issue). This would include the assessment of the public concern regarding exposure to small toxic doses. In addition, impact of hormesis policy change upon the management of industrial risks should be studied.&lt;ref&gt;Poumadere, M. (2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5134">A '''musicologist''' is someone who studies music (see [[musicology]]). A '''historical musicologist''' studies music from a historical perspective. An '''ethnomusicologist''' studies music in its cultural and social contexts (see [[ethnomusicology]]). A '''systematic musicologist''' asks general questions about music from the perspective of relevant disciplines (psychology, sociology, acoustics, philosophy, physiology, computer science) (see [[systematic musicology]]). Systematic musicologists often identify more strongly with their non-musical discipline than with musicology.

'''Music [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]]''' is the copying and distributing of recordings of a piece of music for which the rights owners (composer, recording artist, or [[copyright]]-holding record company) did not give consent. In the contemporary legal environment, it is a form of [[copyright infringement]], which may be either a [[tort|civil wrong]] or a crime depending on jurisdiction. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw much controversy over the ethics of redistributing media content, how much production and distribution companies in the media were losing, and the very scope of what ought to be considered piracy — and cases involving the piracy of music were among the most frequently discussed in the debate.

==History==
The invention of the internet and digital media created music piracy in its modern form. With the invention of newer technology that allowed for the piracy process to become less complicated, it became much more common. Users of the web began adding media files to the internet, and prior potential risks and difficulties to pirating music, such as the physicality of the process, were eliminated. It was much easier for people with little to no knowledge of technology and old piracy methods to gather media files.&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Piracy-History|url=http://piracy.web.unc.edu/brief-history-of-online-piracy/|website=Online Piracy|publisher=UNC Digital Commons|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first application that demonstrated the implications of music piracy was [[Napster]]. Napster enabled users to exchange music files over a common free server without any regard for copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Piracy|url=http://www.csun.edu/~ch1842/piracy/index.html|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napster was quickly shut down after lawsuits filed by [[Metallica]] and [[Dr. Dre]] and a separate lawsuit in regards to the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Napster settles suits|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/07/12/news/napster/|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other music sharing services such as [[Limewire]] continued to be a resource to those searching for free music files. These platforms were also removed after a few years of service due to copyright laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. After finding some loopholes, piracy began to exist in more legal forms, an example being [[Pirate Bay]]. This technical legality was due to the format of the websites and their country of origin and administration. The websites were set up so that the site itself did not host any of the illegal files, but gave the user a map as to where they could access the files. Additionally, in Pirate Bay's case, the website was hosted under Swedish law, where this “map” was not illegal.&lt;ref name="Online Piracy-History"/&gt;

===Arguments over legality===
In face of the growing encroachment on potential sales from internet piracy, industry associations like the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) have lobbied for stricter laws and stricter punishment of those breaking copyright law. Record companies have also turned to technological barriers to copying, such as [[Digital rights management|DRM]], to some [[Digital right management#Controversy|controversy]]. These organizations have tried to add more controls to the digital copy of the music to prevent consumers from copying the music. For the most part, the industry has come to a consensus that, if not DRM, then some similar measures are necessary for them to continue to make a profit.

Critics of the record companies' strategy have proposed that the attempts to maintain sales rates are impeding the rights of legitimate listeners to use and listen to the music as they wish. When the US Congress passed the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], it deliberately gave less copyright control to music composers than that of novelists: "Its fear was the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that power would stifle follow-on creativity".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; According to the internationally established [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]],&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; "Existing laws and regulations may be too broad and general to deal adequately with the rapid technological developments that facilitate digital piracy, and policy makers may need to consider enacting some specific provisions to deal with these infringements. Such provisions should not unduly impede legitimate digital communications, nor unreasonably impact on the Internet as an effective communications platform, commercial channel and educational tool..."&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt;

There have been several means of free access to copyrighted music for the general public including Napster, Limewire, and Spotify. Napster was a free file sharing software created by college student Shawn Fanning to enable people to share and trade music files in mp3 format. Napster became hugely popular because it made it so easy to share and download music files. However, the heavy metal band Metallica sued the company for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2000/04/14/mu4.html | work=Forbes | first=Amy | last=Doan | title=Metallica Sues Napster}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to other artists following suit and shutting down Napster’s service. Likewise, Limewire was a free peer-to-peer file sharing software similar to that of Napster. The software enabled unlimited file sharing between computers and ended being one of the most popular sharing networks around. Like Napster, Limewire struggled through multiple legal battles and inevitably wound up being shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/27/limewire-shut-down|title=LimeWire shut down by federal court|author=Josh Halliday|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spotify and other on-demand streaming services are offering a way for consumers to still get their music for free while also contributing to the musician in a small way instead of simply illegally downloading the music, but it also moves customers away from buying hard copies of music or even legally downloading songs which is severely reducing artists' income. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wlömert|first=Nils|last2=Papies|first2=Dominik|date=2016-06-01|title=On-demand streaming services and music industry revenues — Insights from Spotify's market entry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811615001226|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|series=The Entertainment Industry|volume=33|issue=2|pages=314–327|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) since Shawn Fanning started the program file sharing program Napster in 1999 music revenue has gone down 53% from $14.6 billion to $7.0 billion in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = RIAA - Scope Of The Problem - June 14, 2015|url = https://www.riaa.com/physicalpiracy.php?content_selector=piracy-online-scope-of-the-problem|website = riaa.com|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done in 2007 by the Institute of Policy Innovation states that music piracy resulted in a loss of 71,060 U.S. jobs, out of which 23,860 would have been in the recording industry and 44,200 jobs in other unrelated industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipi.org/ipi_issues/detail/the-true-cost-of-sound-recording-piracy-to-the-us-economy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law enforcement===
The RIAA, a powerful lobby for the recording industry, is responsible for carrying out most of the lawsuits against music piracy in the United States. Some claim that the enforcement against music piracy, which may cost copyright violators up to $150,000 per infringement,&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; is unreasonable, and that it may even violate United States constitutional protections against [[cruel and unusual punishment]]. Some have accused the RIAA of outright bullying, as when one of their lawyers, Matt Oppenheimer, told the defendant in one lawsuit, “You don’t want to pay another visit to a dentist like me".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt; In that same case, according to Lawrence Lessig, "the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it took every penny [the defendant] had saved".&lt;ref name=lessig /&gt;

Further attempts at progress towards controlling the privacy of public media content by targeting the elimination of piracy were made when the highly anticipated yet often debated bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was passed in recent years. The bill was first introduced in October 2011 by the United States House representative Lamar S. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/house-introduces-internet-piracy-bill/2011/10/26/gIQA0f5xJM_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Cecilia | last=Kang | title=House introduces Internet piracy bill | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general scope of the law was to fulfill the goal of putting a stop to online piracy by expanding upon existing criminal laws regarding copyright violations. The essential goal of the bill was to protect intellectual property of content creators by raising awareness of the severity of punishments for copyright infringement. Naturally, the bill was met with considerable opposition from various parties. One instance of this was an article comment by Edward J. Black, president and CEO of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, who questioned the potential effectiveness of the bill by reasoning that the major pirate websites that SOPA attempts to eliminate could just as easily respawn under a different name if taken down as early as a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/edward-j-black/stop-online-piracy-act-vote_b_1145949.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Internet Users, Free Speech Experts, Petition Against SOPA | date=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, strong protest attempts were made across the internet when numerous high-profile online organizations including Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, and participating in American Censorship Day on January 18, with some sites including Reddit and Wikipedia going as far as completely blacking out all of their pages, redirecting the user to SOPA protest messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2011-11-16/-american-censorship-day-makes-an-online-statement-the-ticker|title='American Censorship Day' Makes an Online Statement: The Ticker|date=16 November 2011|work=BloombergView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, as a result of aggressive protests and lack of consenting opinions within the congress, SOPA was tabled on January 20 by its creator, House representative Lamar Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/01/20/sopa-is-dead-timeline-january-blackout/|title=The Week That Killed SOPA: A Timeline|author=Alex Fitzpatrick|date=20 January 2012|work=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic ramifications==
Piracy's real effect on music sales is difficult to accurately assess. In [[neoclassical economics]] prices are determined by the combination of the forces of [[supply and demand]], but the participators in the digital market do not always follow the usual motives and behaviors of the supply and demand system. First, the cost of digital distribution has decreased significantly from the costs of distribution by former methods. Furthermore, the majority of the filesharing community will distribute copies of music for a zero price in monetary terms, and there are some consumers who are willing to pay a certain price for legitimate copies even when they could just as easily obtain pirated copies,&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; such as with [[pay what you want]] vendors.

Another issue is that because many people in the world illegally download music because they cannot afford to purchase legitimate copies, not every illegal download necessarily equates to a lost sale. This has some effect on music sales, but as [[Lawrence Lessig]] points out, there is wide asymmetry between the estimated volume of illegal downloading and the projected loss of sales:

{{cquote|In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9 percent, from 882 million to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7 percent. This confirms a trend over the past few years. The RIAA blames Internet piracy for the trend, though there are many other causes that could account for this drop. SoundScan, for example, reports a more than 20 percent drop in the number of CDs released since 1999. That no doubt accounts for some of the decrease in sales... But let’s assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD sales is because of Internet sharing. Here’s the rub: In the same period that the RIAA estimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the RIAA estimates that 2.1 billion CDs were downloaded for free. Thus, although 2.6 times the total number of CDs sold were downloaded for free, sales revenue fell by just 6.7 percent... [So] there is a huge difference between downloading a song and stealing a CD.&lt;ref name=lessig&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Lawrence Lessig]]|year=2004 |title=Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity |location=New York |publisher=The Penguin Press |isbn=1-59420-006-8 |oclc=53324884 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Woolley's introduction each year It is estimated that 12.5 billion dollars are lost due to file sharing and music piracy, and 5 billion of that is profits lost from the music industry directly. Due to this dramatic loss in profits the music industry has been forced to cut down their staffing. Music piracy has become such an issue that the industry is encouraged to adapt to this new era and change.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, D. J. (2010). The cynical pirate: how cynicism effects music piracy. Academy of Information and Management Sciences Journal, 13(1), 31+. Retrieved from http://bi.galegroup.com.prxy4.ursus.maine.edu/essentials/article/GALE|A241861851/b8772514a705be025bdcd7edee6d5cdc?u=maine_orono&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital copies==
The article, "The Music Industry On (The) Line? Surviving Music Piracy In A Digital Era" By Jelle Janssens, Stijn Vandaele, and Tom Vander Beken presents an analysis of the prevalence of piracy in music trade, which has affected the global sales of CDs. This article points out that technological development such as file sharing, MP3 players, and CDRs have increased music piracy. The most common forms of music piracy are Internet Piracy and compact disc piracy. It also discusses the association between music piracy and organized crime, which is defined as profit-driven illegal activities. The fact that digital products are virtual instead of physical affects the economic mechanisms behind the production and distribution of content, and how piracy works for digital as opposed to physical products: "the main consequence of the non-physical form of digital products is their virtually negligible marginal cost of reproduction and their ability to be digitally delivered."&lt;ref name=oecd&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Stryszowski |editor1-first=Piotr |editor2-last=Scorpecci |editor2-first=Danny |year=2009 |title=Piracy of Digital Content |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Publishing |isbn=978-92-64-06543-7 |oclc=663833839 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of burning a CD drastically lowered the [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] for record companies, as well as for music pirates, and with the growing tendency toward [[online distribution]] among legitimate and illicit distributors alike, the expense of distributing shrunk further from the costs of printing and transporting CDs to merely the costs of maintaining a [[website]].&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; By sheer volume of file transfers, though, distributing music through traditional web servers and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers were not as popular as [[peer to peer]] (P2P) now, because the traditional [[Direct download link|direct download]] method is slower.

The 2008 British Music Rights survey&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Orlowski]]. ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/16/bmr_music_survey/ 80% want legal P2P - survey]''. [[The Register]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that 80% of people in Britain wanted a legal P2P service. This was consistent with the results of earlier research conducted in the United States, upon which the [[Open Music Model]] was based.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]. ''[http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438 Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models]''. [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the majority of filesharers in the survey preferred to get their music from "local sources" such as [[Local area network|LAN]] connections, [[email]], [[USB flash drive|flash drives]], sharing with other people they know personally.&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt; The other most common method of filesharing was with P2P technologies. By 2007, P2P networks' popularity had grown so much that they used as much as 39% of the total volume of information exchanged over the internet.&lt;ref name=oecd /&gt;

==Rights Holders Solution==
Alongside the RIAA and BPI's industry anti-piracy service sit a number of other independent companies offering anti-piracy solutions. 
These companies tend to have a better reach and success rate than the slower industry bodies and provide an alternative solution. Notable market leaders include [[Audiolock|AudioLock]], Web Sheriff, Topple Track, Detecnet, Muso and Attributor.

==Minimising Online Music Piracy==
There are ways to minimise music piracy on using the latest Google court decisions on the [[right to be forgotten]] as well as using some proven techniques relating to adding a watermark to the tracks and uploading the files yourself with promotional intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixingmastering.co.uk/music-piracy-how-to-avoid/|title=Music Piracy And How To Avoid It|work=Mixing Mastering Resources for Music, Media and Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper called the '''Music Anti-Piracy Best Practise Guidelines''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicindie.com/resources/document-library|title=Document library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been published by music anti-piracy specialists [http://www.audiolock.net AudioLock] and endorsed by the [[Association of Independent Music]], the Association For Electronic Music (AFEM), [[Digital distribution|music distributors]] Believe Digital and [[Judge Jules]] (DJ and Lawyer). These guidelines give advice on how to minimise exposure to music-piracy and how best to utilise the solutions that are available.

Statistics have shown that since the latter half the 2000s, there has been a decline in music piracy. According to a NPD survey, in 2012, approximately one in ten Internet users in the United States downloaded music through a file sharing service similar to BitTorrent or LimeWire. This number is significantly less than 2005, the peak of the piracy phenomenon, when one in five users used peer-to-peer networks to gather music files. The emergence of free streaming services has decreased the number of users who pirate music on the internet. Services such as [[Spotify]] and [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]] have easy-to-use interfaces and decrease the risk for computer viruses and spyware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luckerson|first1=Victor|title=Revenue Up, Piracy Down: Has the Music Industry Finally Turned a Corner?|url=http://business.time.com/2013/02/28/revenue-up-piracy-down-has-the-music-industry-finally-turned-a-corner/|accessdate=23 April 2015|publisher=Time Magazine|date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to the illegal software used by older music piracy networks such as Napster or Limewire, current music streaming services such as Spotify and Rdio offer cheap yet legal access to copyrighted music by paying the rights holders through money made off of payments made by premium users and through advertisements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/30081/13-streaming-music-services-compared-by-price-quality-catalog-size-and-more/ | work=Time | title=13 Streaming Music Services Compared by Price, Quality, Catalog Size and More | first=Matt | last=Peckham | date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neuronal self-avoidance''', or '''isoneural avoidance''', is an important property of [[neuron]]s which consists in the tendency of branches ([[dendrite]]s and [[axon]]s) arising from a single [[soma (biology)|soma]] (also called isoneuronal or sister branches) to turn away from one another. The arrangements of branches within neuronal arbors are established during development and result in minimal crossing or overlap&lt;ref name="kramer"&gt;Kramer AP, Stent GS. 1985.

In opposition, branches from different neurons can overlap freely with one another.

==History==
[[File:PSM V09 D734 Nervous system of the medicinal leech.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright=0.40|Figure 3. Nervous system of the medicinal leech (''H. medicilanis'')]]
The concept of neuronal self-avoidance emerged about 50&amp;nbsp;years ago. The pioneer studies were performed in the leech, focusing on the central nervous system and developing mechanosensory neurons. Leeches from two species: ''Hirudo medicinalis'' and ''Haementeria ghilianii'', remained the main organism for the study of the question of neuronal self-recognition and self-avoidance. In this animal, the repeating segmental pattern of the nervous system along with the fact that neurons are relatively few in number, and many are large enough to be recognized&lt;ref name="Baylor"&gt;Nicholls JG, Baylor DA. 1968. Specific modalities and receptive fields of sensory neurons in CNS of the leech. J. Neurophysiol. 31:740–56&lt;/ref&gt; allowed the experimental study of the general problem of neuronal specificity.
In 1968, through the mapping of mechanoreceptor axonal receptive fields in ''H. medicilalis'', Nicholls and Baylor&lt;ref name="Baylor"/&gt; revealed distinct types of boundaries between axons from the same or different types of neurons, and also between individual neurons. They observed that receptive fields were subdivided into discrete areas, innervated by the different branches of a single cell. These boundaries, unlike those between adjacent fields of different cells, were abrupt showing nearly no overlap. The authors then suggested a mechanism for the spatial arrangement of axons in which ''"a fiber might repel other branches more strongly if they arise from the same cell than if they come from a homologue, and not at all if they come from a cell with a different modality"''.
In 1976, Yau&lt;ref&gt;Yau KW. 1976. Receptive fields, geometry and conduction block of sensory neurons in the central nervous system of the leech. J. Physiol. 263:513–38&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed their findings and proposed that the branches of a cell recognized each other, therefore avoiding to grow into the same territory and establishing the discrete areas that Nicholls and Baylor observed. It was then clear that mechanosensory neurons, in leech, show self-avoidance: with the repulsion between branches originating from the same cell, but they did not showed class-avoidance, meaning that branches from the same type of neurons could overlap.

The phenomena was recognized but a lot remained unknown, including the term "Self-avoidance" which arises in 1982/1983 with the studies of Kramer.
In 1982, Kramer&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, AP. 1982. The development of neuronal arborizations in the leech. Neuronal Development: Cellular Approaches in Invertebrates. 882-885&lt;/ref&gt; postulated that isoneuronal axons (axons growing from the same neuron), contrarily to heteroneuronal axons, avoid each other when growing on the same substrate (see Movie).
This was further explored, by other authors, the fact that this self-avoidance would require neurites to be able to distinguish between self and non-self, reinforcing the ideas of Yau.
In 1983 Kramer and Kuwada&lt;ref name="Kramer"/&gt; propose that this self-recognition of two growing axonal processes might be mediated by their [[filopodia]], which appear to make mutual contacts. This idea was backed up by the studies of Goodman et al. (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Goodman CS, Raper JA, Ho RK, Chang S. 1982. Path-finding of neuronal growth cones in grasshopper embryos. Developmental Order: Its Origin and Regulation. 275-316&lt;/ref&gt; in insect neurons, which postulated that filopodia played an important role in the recognition and choice of axonal growth pathways.
The conservation of the mechanism in invertebrates together with the fact that adult morphology of many neurons appears to satisfy the rule, suggested that non-overlap of isoneuronal processes could be a general phenomenon of neuronal development.
In 1985 empirical data was added by Kramer and Stent&lt;ref name="kramer"/&gt; with the experimentally induced variations in the branching pattern through surgically preventing or delaying the outgrowth of the axon branches. As predicted by the proposal of self-avoidance, interference with the outgrowth of a field axon branch resulted in the spread of the axon branch of the other field into what normally was not a territory. Thus, neuronal self-avoidance does play a significant role in the development of mechanosensory receptive field structure.
[[File:Kramer and stent.png|thumbnail|Figure 4. Subfields of leech mechanosensory axons compete for territory.

If the growth cone of one branch is crushed (B) or delayed (C), the sibling subfields grow occupying the free territory.''Simplified diagrams, based on results in Kramer &amp; Stent, 1985)'']]
In the late 1980s, the molecular machinery that could be the basis of the phenomena started to be unveiled. Receptors such as cell adhesion molecules of the [[cadherin]] and [[immunoglobulin]] super families, which mediate interactions between opposing cell surfaces, and [[integrins]] acting as receptors for extracellular matrix components were widely expressed on developing [[neurite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer KM, Tomaselli KJ, Lilien J, Reichardt LF. 1988. N-cadherin, NCAM, and integrins promote retinal neurite outgrowth on astrocytes in vitro. J. Cell Biol. 107:1177–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomaselli KJ, NeugebauerKM, Bixby JL, Lilien J, Reichardt LF. 1988. N-cadherin and integrins: two receptor systems that mediate neuronal process outgrowth on astrocyte surfaces. Neuron 1:33–43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Macagno et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Macagno ER, Gao WO, Baptista CA, Passani MB. 1990. Competition or inhibition? Developmental strategies in the establishment of peripheral projections by leech neurons. J. Neurobiol. 21: 107-119&lt;/ref&gt; integrated the results from several studies, once again emphasizing the evolutionary conservation of the overall phenomena: Leech neurons, like those of other invertebrates and those of vertebrates, undergo specific interactions during development which allow the definition of the adult morphologies and synaptic connections. That morphology reflects the developmental compromise between the potential of the neuron to grow and the constraints placed upon that growth by internal and external factors. Thus, the self-recognizing mechanism would be useful not only to self-avoidance but also as a means of individualization. During development, competition among neurons of the same type for a limited supply required for process growth and maintenance would occur, with one cell gaining space at the expense of others. Inhibitory interactions were also invoked, and this placed the phenomena of self-recognition in the bigger picture of the [[axon guidance]] process. Together, these studies led to the view that neural circuit assembly emerged as a result of a relatively small number of different signals and their receptors, some acting in a graded fashion and in different combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Tessier-Lavigne M, Goodman CS. 1996. The molecular biology of axon guidance. Science 274:1123–3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, scientists became aware that self-avoidance was also present in non-neuronal cell types, such as leech comb cells, which might similarly form discrete domains.&lt;ref&gt;Jellies J, Kristan WB. 1991. The oblique muscle organizer in Hirudo medicinalis, an identified cell projecting multiple parallel growth cones in an orderly array. Devi Biol. 148: 334-354&lt;/ref&gt; Later, this was also observed in mammalian astrocytes.&lt;ref&gt;Bushong EA, Martone ME, Jones YZ, Ellisman MH. 2002. Protoplasmic astrocytes in CA1 stratum radiatum occupy separate anatomical domains. J Neurosci 22(1):183–92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogata K, Kosaka T. 2002. Structural and quantitative analysis of astrocytes in the mouse hippocampus. Neuroscience 113(1):221–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livet J, Weissman TA, Kang H, Draft RW, Lu J, Bennis RA, et al. 2007. Transgenic strategies for combinatorial expression of fluorescent proteins in the nervous system. Nature 450: 56–62&lt;/ref&gt;
Wang and Macagno,&lt;ref&gt;Wang H, Macagno ER. 1998. A detached branch stops being recognized as self by other branches of a neuron. J. Neurobiol. 35: 53-64&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998, again recurring to ''Hirudo medicinalis'' mechanosensory neurons, performed an elegant experiment in order to try to answer the still remaining question: "How does a cell recognize self and respond by not growing over or along itself?"
The authors then proposed two general types of mechanisms: I) External signals: Sibling neurites display surface identifying molecular factors, unique to each cell, that are capable of homotypic binding and therefore repel sibling neurites, or II) Internal signals: synchronous cell activity, such as voltage, which is transmitted within the cell mediating a dynamic mechanism of sibling growth inhibition.
Contrarily to the first hypothesis, the second would require the continuity and communication between all parts of the cell for self-avoidance to occur.
So the experiment consisted of detaching one of the neurons dendrites and see how the remaining attached dendrites reacted towards the detached fragment, "do they still avoid overlapping?"
The result was that the detached branch would stop being recognized as "self" by the other branches of the neuronal, leading to dendrite overlap.
The clear conclusion of the study was that continuity between all parts of the neuron is critical for self-avoidance to operate. The authors then suggest various mechanisms that require continuity and could function as recognition signal, and thus might be the responsible ones, such as "electrical activity, active or passive, as well as the diffusion of cytoplasmic signals either passively or by fast axonal transport".
In the late 1990s and beyond, model organisms started to be used in the studies and the molecular mechanisms of self-avoidance started to be unraveled. In 1999 Wu and Maniatis&lt;ref&gt;Wu Q, Maniatis T. 1999. A striking organization of a large family of human neural cadherin-like cell adhesion genes. Cell 97:779–90&lt;/ref&gt; discovered a striking organization of a large family of human neural protocadherin cell adhesion genes which formed a gene cluster encoding 58 protocadherins. The members of the protocadherin gene cluster were compelling candidates to provide the molecular code required for the maintenance of the self/non-self discrimination that led to self-avoidance. It was later (2012) confirmed, by Lefebvre et al.,&lt;ref name="Lef"/&gt; in a study with [[amacrine cells]] and [[Purkinje cells]] of ''Mus musculus'', that these proteins are expressed in different combinations in individual neurons, thus providing "barcodes" with that distinguish one neuron from another.

In 2000, Schmucker et al.,&lt;ref name="Schm"&gt;Schmucker D, Clemens JC, Shu H, Worby CA, Xiao J, et al. 2000. Drosophila Dscam is an axon guidance receptor exhibiting extraordinary molecular diversity. Cell 101:671–84&lt;/ref&gt; through [[cDNA]] and [[Genetic analysis|genomic analyses]] of ''Drosophila'' dendritic arborization sensory neurons, the existence of multiple forms of ''[[DSCAM|Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam)]]'' was revealed. The authors saw that alternative splicing could potentially generate more than 38,000 Dscam isoforms and hypothesized that this molecular diversity could contribute to the specificity of neuronal connectivity and thus, self-avoidance.

Together, the discoveries of the two large families of cell surface proteins encoded by the Dscam1 locus and the clustered [[protocadherin]] (Pcdh) loci opened the door to the numerous modern studies. The current studies take great advantage not only of the uprising of the molecular and genomic biology but also from the bioinformatics tools, developed since the 19th century.

==Models, structures and development of self-avoidance==

===Animal models===

Self-avoidance has been widely discussed amongst scientists and throughout time the experiments were done in several animal models.
The first experiments were done in leech. In 1981, Wässle tried to understand how [[retinal ganglion cell]]s establish their dendritic territories in cats. Processes like [[Neuronal tiling|dendritic tiling]] and self-avoidance are extremely important to correct development of neuronal structures, and in this specific case ganglion cells have to cover the [[retina]] to guarantee that every point of the visual space is actually "seen". He saw that cell bodies are arrayed in regular mosaic, and dendritic fields adapt to the available space. However, this hypothesis was based in mathematical models: [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet model]].

Perry and Linden (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Perry VH, Linden R, 1982. Evidence for Dendritic Competition in The Developing Retina. Nature 297:683–685&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to present clear evidence of the dendritic "competition" in mice retina. Destruction of ganglion cells gives the chance to their neighboring cells to extend their dendritic projections. They proposed competition for [[synapse]]s as the cause for equilibrium between growth and repulsion of dendrites.

Though mouse and Drosophila are the models currently used to construct a model of self-avoidance for vertebrates and invertebrates respectively, throughout time there are several examples of this phenomenon in other model and non-model species:

*Frog ''([[Xenopus laevis]])''

[[Trigeminal nerve|Trigeminal neurons]] in head skin exhibit a competitive behavior and only when one of them is completely removed, for example the left [[trigeminal ganglion]], allows the right ganglion neurites to cross midline and innervate left side of the head. The correct innervation is due to repulsive nature of interactions between these movement detector neurites reinforcing all the anterior models of self-avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson DL, Roberts A, 1983. Competition during Innervation of Embryonic Amphibian Head Skin. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 218:49–59&lt;/ref&gt;

*Goldfish ''([[Goldfish|Carassius spp.]])''

Retina grows throughout life by addition of new neurons at the margin and death of [[Ganglion|ganglion neurons]] in the center. Once again it is proved that each cell senses neighbor cells and can occupy space left by other.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock PF, 1989. Exclusionary dendritic interactions in the retina of the goldfish. Development 106:589–598&lt;/ref&gt;

*Zebra fish ''([[Zebrafish|Danio rerio]])''

Trigeminal neurons, developed 16hrs post fertilization, are part of the [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral sensory system]] and detect thermal and mechanical stimuli in the skin. The "growth-and-repulsion" model arose from complex topographic restriction of [[growth cone]]s between trigeminal and [[Rohon-Beard cell|Rohon-Beard neurons]].&lt;ref&gt;Sagasti A, Guido MR, Raible DW, Schier AF, 2005. Repulsive Interactions Shape the Morphologies and Functional Arrangement of ZebrafishPeripheral Sensory Arbors. Current Biology 15:804–814&lt;/ref&gt;

*Planaria ''(Dugesia japonica)''

[[DSCAM|Dscam]] mutants exhibit severely disorganized neural network and axon fasciculation.&lt;ref&gt;Fusaoka E, Inoue T, Mineta K, Agata K, Takeuchi K, 2006. Structure and function of primitive immunoglobulin superfamily neural cell adhesion molecules: a lesson from studies on planarian. Genes to Cells 11:541–555&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal structures for self-avoidance studies==

The two major structures used in self-avoidance studies are the [[Retinal ganglion cell|retinal ganglion cells (RGC)]] in mice and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory neurons]] in ''Drosophila''. These structures are pointed as different molecular models because the principal molecule involved in self-avoidance is Dscam in invertebrates and Protocadherins in vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Zipursky SL, Grueber WB, 2013. The Molecular Basis of Self-Avoidance. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 36:547–568&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mouse retina===

Correct assembly of the components in mice retina is dependent of [[DSCAM|Dscam]]/[[DSCAM|DscamL1]] correct expression to form mosaics of different cell type of RGC, soma spacing and dendrite arborization, thus ensuring the coverage of all visual area by each cell type and more specifically to inhibit excessive fasciculation and clumping of cell bodies in photoreceptors, rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and amacrine cells in visual system. The occurrence of correct stratification and connection with synapses tells us that Dscam [[knockout]] affects only the repulsive interactions and coverage of the dendritic arbors and functional bindings are maintained.&lt;ref&gt;Huberman AD, 2009. Mammalian DSCAMs: They Won't Help You Find a Partner, but They'll Guarantee You Some Personal Space. Neuron 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fu"&gt;Fuerst PG, Bruce F, Tiau M, Wei W, Elstrott J, Feller MB, Erskine L, Singer JH, Burgess RW, 2009. DSCAM and DSCAML1 Function in Self-Avoidance in Multiple Cell Types in the Developing Mouse Retina. Neuron 64:484–497&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual main conclusions are based in the identification of different types of retinal neurons, each one with a different coverage factor value revealing graded degrees of homotypic dendritic repulsion. Developmental sequence accepted is 1) define number and spacing of cells, 2) controlled growth of branches and 3) fine-tune of dendritic tiling for maximal coverage of the structure. Experiments with mutant mice for ''Math5'' and ''Brn3b'' (responsible of degeneration of 95% and 80% of retinal ganglion cells, respectively) shows that removal of ganglion cells doesn't decrease the retinal ganglion cell types and that position of these cells isnot defined by dendritic homotypic interactions only, but for some kind of intrinsic genetic program.&lt;ref name="linn"&gt;Lin B, Wang SW, Masland RH, 2004. Retinal Ganglion Cell Type, Size, and Spacing Can Be Specified Independent of Homotypic Dendritic Contacts. Neuron 43:475–485&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dendritic arborization neurons===

''Drosophila melanogaster'' is the model for experiments in [[Neuron|multiple dendritic (MD) neurons]] which compose the stereotyped pattern of peripheral nervous system. [[Dendrite|Dendritic arborization neurons]] are the major subtype of MD neurons group and presents highly branched dendrites underneath the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. Sugimura et al.&lt;ref name="Sugimura"&gt;Sugimura K, Yamamoto M, Niwa R, Satoh D, Goto S, Tanigushi M, Hayashi S, Uemura T, 2003. Distinct Developmental Modes and Lesion-Induced Reactions of Dendrites of Two Classes of Drosophila Sensory Neurons. J. Neurosci. 23:3752–3760&lt;/ref&gt; showed [[Dendrite|dendritic arborization (da) neurons]] that stabilize their branches shape in early larval stages and others that continue shaping throughout life cycle.

As other types of cells involved in processes dependent of self-recognition (like self-avoidance and tiling, See Figure-2) these da neurons can fill the empty spaces left by neighbor cells and this filling-in process is triggered by loss of local isoneural inhibitory contacts.

===Larval eye===

Since ''Drosophila'' is one of the best studied models in mechanisms of neuronal self-recognition, we can find several results obtained in larval stages. One of the most remarkable examples is the incorrect development of dendritic arbors in the larval eye ([[Arthropod eye|Bolwig's organ]]) due to Dscam knockout mutation.

==Development==

Numerous models and structures with different development timing and life cycles are used in studies of self-avoidance. Therefore, some conflicts arise when we try to define a strict development phase for the occurrence of these phenomena. The initial idea was that, in some early development point, neural cells contact with each other and organize their distribution, but several studies demonstrated that self-avoidance is also present in adult life.

To solve this question it would be ideal to monitor dendritic development of neurons from its birth till maturation inside [[In situ hybridization|whole-mount]] animals.&lt;ref name="Fu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="linn" /&gt;

In ''Drosophila'', studies comprise both larval and adult phases, and number of hours after egg layer is determinant for correct construction of dendritic tiling in sensory neurons.&lt;ref name="Sugimura" /&gt; Early in the pupal stage, those neurons prune all their dendrites. Later each neuron grows a completely new dendrite for adult function. While the dendrites are being remodeled, the axons stay largely intact&lt;ref&gt;Han S, Song Y, Xiao H, Wang D, Franc NC, Jan LY, Jan YN, 2013. Epidermal Cells Are the Primary Phagocytes in the Fragmentation and Clearance of Degenerating Dendrites in Drosophila. Neuron 81:544–560&lt;/ref&gt; and all these phases will be negatively impacted in case of interference with self-avoidance propriety.

[[Exon]]s of Dscam domains can be differently expressed according to the life cycle phase of the fly. Exon 9 [[RNA splicing|splicing]] is temporally regulated, with only a few exon 9 sequences contributing to early embryo isoforms and the remaining exon 9 possible sequences become more prevalent with age. These results prove that, independently of the thousands of [[Protein isoform|isoforms]] that could be generated, the diversity continues to be temporally and spatially controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Schmucker D, Chen B, 2009.Dscam and DSCAM: complex genes in simple animals, complex animals yet simple genes. Genes Dev. 23:147–156&lt;/ref&gt;

In mouse retina the majority of ganglion cells are born at [[Carnegie stages|E17 (embryonic stage/day 17)]]. At this age the retina has reached 25% of its mature size&lt;ref name="linn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grueber WB, Sagasti A, 2010. Self-Avoidance and Tiling: Mechanisms of Dendrite and Axon Spacing. Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular basis of self-avoidance==

Cellular studies of self-avoidance imply that any underlying molecular mechanism must enforce robust and selective contact-dependent cell surface recognition only between sister branches, and must link recognition to changes in [[growth cone]] behavior. Recent studies to define the molecular basis of contact-dependent homotypic interactions led to the identification of two large families of cell-surface proteins encoded by the Drosophila Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1 (''Dscam1'') locus and the clustered [[protocadherin]] (Pcdh) loci in mammals. These proteins, with diverse extracellular domains, and shared cytoplasmatic presumptive intracellular signaling domains, are able to provide diverse recognition specificities to a vast array of different [[neurite]]s, endowing neurons with a unique cell-surface identity that allows neurons to distinguish self from non-self.
Additional self-surface receptors implicated in self-avoidance include the immunoglobulin superfamily member Turtle, which functions in some ''Drosophila'' da neurons to enforce terminal branch spacing.&lt;ref&gt;Long H, Ou Y, Rao Y, vanMeyel DJ. 2009. Dendrite branching and self-avoidance are controlled by Turtle, a conserved IgSF protein in Drosophila. Development 136: 3475–3484&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invertebrates==

===DSCAM1===
Several studies have implicated ''Drosophila'' ''[[DSCAM|Dscam1]]'' in dendritic and axonal self-avoidance and process spacing in diverse neuronal populations, including [[mushroom bodies|mushroom body axons]], olfactory projection neuron (PN) dendrites, and [[Dendrite|dendritic arborization (da) neuron dendrites]]&lt;ref name="Hu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang J, ZugatesCT, Liang IH, LeeCH, LeeT. 2002a.

Dscam-mediated repulsion controls tiling and self-avoidance. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 18:84–89&lt;/ref&gt;
It is notable that the function of Dscam both invertebrates and invertebrates is context and species-dependent, as the molecule has been shown to regulate repulsion, outgrowth, attraction/ adhesion, and synapse formation in different systems.&lt;ref&gt;Fuerst PG, Koizumi A, Masland RH, Burgess RW. 2008. Neurite arborization and mosaic spacing in the mouse retina require DSCAM. Nature 451:470–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li HS, Chen JH, WuW, Fagaly T, Zhou L, et al. 1999. Vertebrate Slit, a secreted ligand for the transmembrane protein Roundabout, is a repellent for olfactory bulb axons. Cell 96:807–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Dscam1 encodes an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member which, in Drosophila, can generate up to 19,008 proteins with distinct [[ectodomain]]s.&lt;ref name="Schm" /&gt; In [[Ligand binding assay|binding assays]], Dscams show isoform-specific homophilic interactions, but little interaction occurs between different, yet closely related, [[Protein isoform|isoforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Wojtowicz WM, Flanagan JJ, Millard SS, Zipursky SL, Clemens JC. 2004. Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam generates axon guidance receptors that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding.

A vast repertoire of Dscam binding specificities arises from modular interactions of variable Ig domains. Cell 130:1134–45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dscam1 controls self-avoidance==

'''[[DSCAM|Dscam1]] mediated self-recognition is essential for self-avoidance between sister neurites'''
Hughes et al. (2007) reported that Dscam [[Mutation|loss-of-function]] in da neurons caused excessive self-crossing of dendrites from the same neuron. Dscam over-expression forced the respective dendrites to segregate from each other. Based on these data, Dscam results in a lack of self-avoidance of sister dendrites. Therefore, the direct isoform-specific homophilic Dscam-Dscam interactions must result in signal transduction events that lead to repulsion of dendrites expressing identical Dscam isoforms. This conversion of an initial Dscam-dependent cell-surface interaction into a repulsive response that leads to dendrite separation in da neurons is supported by Matthews et al. (2007) in a study that demonstrated that the ectopic expression of identical Dscam isoforms on the dendrites of different cells promoted growth away from each other. The authors also suggest that identical Dscam isoforms expressed in two cell populations ''in vitro'' induced their aggregation in an isoform-specific manner, showing that Dscam provides cells with the ability to distinguish between different cell surfaces.
Moreover, expression of single Dscam1 molecules lacking most of their cytoplasmic tail prevented ectopic branch segregation and instead led to apparently stable [[Role of cell adhesions in neural development|adhesion]] between dendrites.
Combined, these results support a simple model for a direct role for Dscam in self-recognition in which identical Dscam [[ectodomain]]s on the surfaces of isoneuronal dendrites recognize each other and induce a subsequent repulsive signal that is mediated by domains in the cytoplasmic tail (Figure 7).

'''Homophilic recognition provides the molecular basis for self-avoidance'''

To test whether homophilic binding of Dscam1 isoforms is required for self-avoidance, Wu and coworkers generated pairs of chimeric isoforms that bind to each other (heterophilic) but not to themselves (homophilic). These isoforms failed to support self-avoidance. By contrast, co-expression of complementary isoforms within the same neuron restored self-avoidance. These data establish that recognition between [[DSCAM|Dscam1]] isoforms on opposing surfaces of neurites of the same cell provides the molecular basis for self-avoidance.&lt;ref name="Wu" /&gt;

===Diversity at the Dscam1 locus is essential for self-recognition===

'''Diversity of Dscam isoforms in individual neurons is not required for self-avoidance ...'''

In 2004, Zhan et al. published a study in which the function of Dscam diversity was explored by assessing the isoforms of Dscam expressed by the developing [[Mushroom bodies|mushroom body (MB) neurons]], as well as the ability of individual isoforms to rescue the Dscam [[Mutation|loss-of-function phenotypes]] and the consequences of [[ectopic expression]] of single Dscam isoforms. They demonstrated that different subtypes of MB neurons express different arrays of Dscam isoforms and that loss of Dscam1 in these neurons leads to a failure in branch separation, a phenotype that can be rescued by the expression of single arbitrary isoforms in single neurons.
Also, in da neurons, single arbitrarily chosen isoforms rescued the Dscam1 null self-avoidance phenotype.&lt;ref name="Wu" /&gt; These results lead to the conclusion that Dscam1 diversity is not required in individual neurons for self-avoidance.

'''... but diversity of Dscam isoforms expressed by neurons of different types is essential for discriminating between self and non-self neurites'''

To test whether sister branch segregation requires neighboring [[Mushroom bodies|mushroom body axons]] to express different sets of Dscam isoforms, Hattori et al. (2009)&lt;ref name="Hat"&gt;Hattori D, Chen Y, Matthews BJ, Salwinski L, Sabatti C, et al. 2009. Robust discrimination between self and non-self neurites requires thousands of Dscam1 isoforms. Nature 461:644–48&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the entire repertoire of Dscam ectodomains to just a single isoform using [[homologous recombination]] and examined [[Mushroom bodies|mushroom body]] morphology in ''Dscam&lt;sup&gt;single&lt;/sup&gt;'' and control animals. In the majority of the [[mushroom bodies]] analyzed, one of the two lobes was completely absent and in the few remaining samples, one lobe was significantly thinner than the other. This dominant phenotype indicates that the defects do not result from the loss of any one isoform, but rather the presence of the same isoform on all axons.
These studies led to the conclusion that each neuron expresses a set of Dscam1 isoforms largely different from their neighbors and that it is crucial for neighboring neurons to express distinct Dscam isoforms, but the specific identity of the isoforms expressed in an individual neuron is unimportant, as long as sister branches express the identical set of isoforms to allow for the homotypic repulsion between them.

'''Thousands of isoforms are required for proper self-recognition'''

Later on, Hattori et al. (2009)&lt;ref name="Hat" /&gt; took a genomic replacement strategy to generate mutant animals in which the number of potential Dscam1 isoforms was limited. Their goal was to determine how many isoforms were necessary to ensure that neurites do not inappropriately recognize and avoid non-self-neurites. Branching patterns improved as the potential number of isoforms increased, independently of the identity of the isoforms. In conclusion, the size of isoform pool required for robust discrimination between self and non-self is in the thousands.

In sum, isoform identity between branches of the same neuron leads to recognition via the extracellular region and repulsion mediated by the intracellular tail of Dscam1. As the Dscam1 isoforms expressed in different da neurons are likely to be different, dendrites of different da neurons do not inappropriately recognize non-self as self. Thus, Dscam1 proteins are required for self-avoidance and provide the molecular code by which neurites discriminate between self-dendrites and those of neighboring cells (Figure 7).

==Vertebrates==

===DSCAM and DSCAML1===

Self-avoidance has only recently been explored in the vertebrate brain development and mainly in the context of patterning neurites in the [[Inner plexiform layer]]s (IPLs).&lt;ref name="Fu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fu9"&gt;Fuerst PG, Burgess RW. 2009. Adhesion molecules in establishing retinal circuitry. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 19:389–94&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to ''Drosophila'', mouse DSCAMs are typical cell surface molecules, lacking the massive [[alternative splicing]] of the fly Dscam1 orthologous undergoes. So although DSCAMs may retain a conserved function in mediating self-avoidance in vertebrates, the absence of molecular diversity makes it clear that they do not play a role in self-recognition.

'''[[DSCAM|Dscams]] act to negate cell-type-specific interactions rather than actively promoting repulsion in vertebrates' neurites'''

Considering that ''Dscam'' and ''Dscaml1'' have non-overlapping expression patterns in the mouse retina, with ''Dscam'' being expressed in a subset of [[Retina amacrine cell|amacrine cells]] and most [[Retinal ganglion cell|retinal ganglion cells (RGC)]] and ''Dscaml1'' expressed in the rod circuit, Fuerst et al. (2009) examined [[retinal ganglion cell]] populations in ''Dscam&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;'' mice and, in addition, assessed retinal anatomy in the rod circuit using a [[Gene trapping|gene-trap-knockout]] allele of ''Dscaml1''. In the absence of either gene, the cells that would normally express it showed excessive fasciculation of their dendrites and clumping of their cell bodies. These findings led to the conclusion that ''Dscam'' and ''Dscaml1'' prevent excessive adhesion, primarily by masking cell-type-specific adhesive interactions between dendrites of the same cell class, rather than actively promoting repulsion between them.
Thus, in the absence of diversity, mammalian DSCAMs do not provide cells with the ability to distinguish between their own processes and the processes of all other cells, including processes from cells of the same type. Instead, DSCAM acts to negate cell-type-specific interactions that are promoted by other recognition molecules.

===Protocadherin===
More recent studies demonstrated that mice use a different family of cell recognition molecules: clustered [[Protocadherin|Protocadherins (Pcdhs)]], in a fly Dscam1-like strategy to regulate self-avoidance. Although both clustered Pcdhs and Dscam1 genes generate families of proteins with diverse ectodomains joined to a common cytoplasmic domain, the mode of generating clustered Pcdhs and fly Dscam1 counterpart diversity is markedly different. Pcdhs diversity is largely generated by alternative promoter choice, as opposed to alternative splicing.&lt;ref&gt;Tasic B, Nabholz CE, Baldwin KK, Kim Y, Rueckert EH, et al. 2002. Promoter choice determines splice site selection in protocadherin αand γpre-mRNA splicing. Mol. Cell 10:21–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wa"&gt;Wang X, Su H, Bradley A. 2002b. Molecular mechanisms governing Pcdh-γ gene expression: evidence for a multiple promoter and cis-alternative splicing model. Genes Dev. 16:1890–905&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of Pcdhs isoforms varies between different vertebrate species, but in aggregate, there are typically on the order of 50 isoforms.&lt;ref name="wa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre JL, Zhang Y, MeisterM, Wang X, Sanes JR. 2008. γ-Protocadherins regulate neuronal survival but are dispensable for circuit formation in retina. Development 135:4141–51&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isoform-specific homophilic recognition'''

Compelling evidence for discrete binding specificities of different clustered [[Protocadherin|Pcdhs]] isoforms was uncovered in 2010 by Schreiner &amp; Weiner, who verified that Pcdhs promote isoform-specific homophilic recognition. While the number of Pcdhs isoforms pales in comparison to the number of Dscam1 isoforms, hetero-oligomerization of [[Protocadherin|Pcdhs]] markedly increases the number of discrete binding specificities encoded by the locus.
'''[[Protocadherin|Pcdhs]] are required for self-avoidance'''

To seek roles of [[Protocadherin|Pcdh-γs]] in self-avoidance, Lefebvre et al. (2012) focused on a [[Retina amacrine cell|retinal interneuron]], the [[Retina amacrine cell|starburst amacrine cell (SAC)]], which expresses [[Protocadherin|Pcdh-γs]] and exhibits dramatic dendritic self-avoidance. They used a [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-Lox system]] to delete all the variable domains of the [[Protocadherin|Pcdh-γ]] locus in the developing retina and verified that dendrites arising from a single [[Retina amacrine cell|SAC]] frequently crossed each other and sometimes formed loose bundles, similarly to the removal of [[DSCAM|Dscam1]] from da neurons (Figure 8).

'''Pcdhs diversity is essential for self-recognition'''

Furthermore, Lefebvre and colleagues assessed the requirement for isoform diversity in [[Protocadherin|Pcdh-γ]]-dependent self-avoidance. They demonstrated that single arbitrarily chosen isoforms rescued self-avoidance defects of [[Protocadherin|Pcdh-γ]] mutant and that expression of the same isoform in neighboring [[Retina amacrine cell|SACs]] reduced the overlap between them.
Their results indicate that diversity appears to underlie self/non-self discrimination, presumably because neighboring neurons are unlikely to express the same isoforms and are therefore free to interact. Therefore, isoform diversity enables [[Retina amacrine cell|SACs]] to distinguish isoneuronal from heteroneuronal dendrites. As with ''[[DSCAM|Dscam1]]'', self-avoidance in [[Retina amacrine cell|SACs]] does not rely on a specific isoform, but rather requires that isoform usage differs among neighboring cells.
Thus, two phyla appear to have recruited different molecules to mediate similar, complex strategies for self-recognition, thereby promoting self-avoidance.

The '''Ocean Biogeographic Information System''' ('''OBIS''') is a web-based access point to information about the distribution and abundance of living [[species]] in the [[ocean]]. It was developed as the information management component of the ten year [[Census of Marine Life]] (CoML) (2001-2010), but is not limited to CoML-derived data, and aims to provide an integrated view of all marine biodiversity data that may be made available to it on an open access basis by respective data custodians. According to its web site as at July 2018, OBIS "is a global open-access data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation and sustainable development." 8 specific objectives are listed in the OBIS site, of which the leading item is to "Provide [the] world's largest scientific knowledge base on the diversity, distribution and abundance of all marine organisms in an integrated and standardized format".&lt;ref name-"iobis"&gt;[http://www.iobis.org/ OBIS website (visited 18 July 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and current status==
Initial ideas for OBIS were developed at a CoML meeting on benthic (bottom-dwelling) ocean life in October 1997. Recommendations from this workshop led to a web site (http://marine.rutgers.edu/OBIS) at Rutgers in 1998 to demonstrate the initial OBIS concept.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/12-3_grassle.pdf Grassle, J.F. and Stocks, K.I., 1999. "A Global Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) for the Census of Marine Life." ''Oceanography'' 12(3): 12-14.]&lt;/ref&gt; An inaugural OBIS International Workshop was held on November 3–4 1999 in Washington, DC, which led to scoping of the project and outreach to potential partners, with selected contributions published in a special issue of ''Oceanography'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;''Oceanography'' Volume 13, no. 3, November 2000. Special Issue: Ocean Biogeographic Information System.&lt;/ref&gt; within which OBIS founder Dr. [[J. Frederick Grassle|J. F. Grassle]] articulated the vision of OBIS as "an on-line, worldwide atlas for accessing, modeling and mapping marine biological data in a multidimensional geographic context."&lt;ref&gt;[https://tos.org/oceanography/assets/docs/13-3_grassle.pdf Grassle, J.F. 2000. "The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS): an on-line, worldwide atlas for accessing, modeling and mapping marine biological data in a multidimensional geographic context." ''Oceanography'' 13(3): 5-7.]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000, US Government Agencies in the National Oceanographic Partnership Program together with the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] funded eight research projects to initiate OBIS. In May 2001, the US [[National Science Foundation]] funded [[Rutgers University]] to develop a global portal for OBIS. Also in 2001, an OBIS International Committee was formed and its first meeting was held in August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00322/43301/43037.pdf Zhang, Y. and Grassle, J.F. 2003. "A portal for the Ocean Biogeographic Information System." ''Oceanologica Acta'' 25(5): 193-197.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The production version of the OBIS Portal was launched at Rutgers University in 2002 as the web site http://www.iobis.org, serving 430,000 species-based georeferenced data records from 8 partner databases including fish records from [[FishBase]], cephalopods from [[CephBase]], corals from [[Biogeoinformatics of Hexacorals]], mollusks from the [[Indo-Pacific Mollusc Database]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020320133251/http://www.iobis.org:80/ www.iobis.org: archived version, 20 March 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2006, the OBIS Portal was able to access 9.5 million records of 59,000 species from 112 databases, &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060502051119/http://www.iobis.org:80/OBISPortal www.iobis.org: archived version, 2 May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; and by December 2010 (at the conclusion of the Census of Marine Life) provided access to 27.7 million records representing 167,000 taxon names.&lt;ref name="OBIS2010"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101213223407/http://www.iobis.org/ www.iobis.org: archived version, 13 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; As at July 2018, the OBIS website states that the system provides access to over 45 million observations of nearly 120,000 marine species (the reduced number of names cited being as a result of synonym resolution, i.e. reduction of taxa recorded under multiple names to a single accepted name), based on contributions from 500 institutions from 56 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180705054455/http://iobis.org/about/ About OBIS: archived version, 5 July 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 OBIS was adopted as a project by International Oceanographic Data and Information (IODE) programme of the [[Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission]] (IOC) of [[UNESCO]] and in 2011, with the cessation of funding for the Rutgers-based secretariat and portal from the Sloan Foundation, an offer of hosting by the [[Flanders Marine Institute]] (VLIZ) in [[Oostende]], [[Belgium]] was accepted to become the long term host for the system, from where OBIS is presently maintained and additional development is carried out, without change of web address. OBIS is thus now co-located with two taxonomic databases also maintained at VLIZ, the [[World Register of Marine Species]] and [http://www.irmng.org/ IRMNG], the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera, both of which feed into taxonomic decisions used to control the display of species-based information in OBIS and also provide the taxonomic hierarchy via which OBIS content can be navigated. OBIS is currently under the direction of IODE with advice from a steering group, the IODE Steering Group for OBIS (SG-OBIS); operational activities are directed by an OBIS Executive Committee (OBIS-EC) with support from 6 OBIS Task Teams. The OBIS secretariat, hosted at the UNESCO/IOC project office for IODE in Oostende (Belgium), includes the OBIS project manager and data manager provides training and technical assistance to its data providers, guides new data standards and technical developments, and encourages international cooperation to foster the group benefits of the network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iobis.org/about/governance/ About OBIS: Governance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Data available via OBIS cover all groups of organisms that have any association with marine or [[estuarine]] habitats, also including shorelines and the atmosphere above the ocean, such as marine [[vertebrates]] (fishes, marine mammals, turtles, seabirds, etc.); marine [[invertebrates]] (including [[zooplankton]]); marine [[bacteria]]; and marine [[plants]] (e.g. phytoplankton, seaweeds, mangroves).

==OBIS portal==
As available web technologies have developed, the [http://www.iobis.org OBIS Portal] has been through a number of iterations since its inception in 2002. Initially the system retrieved remote data in real time in response to a user query and used the [http://hercules.kgs.ku.edu/website/Specimen_Mapper/mxmapit.cfm KGS&amp;nbsp;Mapper] to visualize the results. In 2004, centralized metadata indexing and cacheing was introduced leading to faster and more reliable results, and the [http://www.marine.csiro.au/csquares/about-mapper.htm c-squares&amp;nbsp;mapper] was added to options for data visualization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oceandocs.org/bitstream/handle/1834/5643/202.pdf?sequence=1#page=167 Tony Rees and Phoebe Zhang, 2007.

IOC Workshop Report, 202, VLIZ Special Publication 37: pp. 167-176.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a full [[Geographic information system|web GIS]] based system was introduced for the first time along with a new version of the web site which resulted in considerably more detailed and flexible presentation of search results along with a number of new search options.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c7fa/69ef3658c0f4a9998f438e709372664502e3.pdf Ei Fujioka ''et al.'', 2012. "Advancing global marine biogeography research with open-source GIS software and cloud computing." ''Transactions in GIS'' 16(2): 143–160.]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, funding was announced to develop a new "2.0" version of OBIS with improved capabilities, expected around the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iobis.org/2018/04/17/obis2/ "IOC invests in OBIS2.0, a major re-engineering of the OBIS platform",]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional OBIS nodes==
Over the period 2004–present, an international network of [[Regional OBIS Nodes]] has also been established, that are facilitating the connection of data sources in their region to the master OBIS data network and also increasingly provide specialised services or views of OBIS data to users in their particular region.

'''''On the Track of Unknown Animals''''' is a cryptozoological book by the [[Belgium|Belgian]]-[[France|French]] [[zoologist]] [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] that was first published in 1955 under the title ''Sur la Piste des Bêtes Ignorées''. The English translation by Richard Garnett was published in 1958 with some updating by the author and with a foreword by [[Gerald Durrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Raymond |date=28 June 1959 |title=Time Blurred Their Trail |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/06/28/archives/time-blurred-their-trail-on-the-track-of-unknown-animals-by-bernard.html |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher= |location= |volume= |issue= |department=Book Review |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised and abridged edition was published in 1965, and a further edition in 1995. It is credited with introducing the term [[cryptozoology]]&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;George Gaylord Simpson, ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', Vol. '''128''', No. 1 (March 30, 1984), pp1-19 "Mammals and Cryptozoology"&lt;/ref&gt; and established its author as the "Father of Cryptozoology."&lt;ref name=Folklore&gt;Peter Dendle ''Folklore'' Vol 117, No. 2 (2006), pp 190-206 "Cryptozoology in the Medieval and Modern Worlds"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject== 
As one reviewer explained, it is a book "about animals that ''might'' exist."&lt;ref name=Science&gt;D. Johnson ''Science New Series'', Vol. 130, No. 3384 (Nov. 6, 1959), pp. 1245-1246 (book review)&lt;/ref&gt; ''On the Track of Unknown Animals'' cites animals that had only been discovered relatively recently, such as the [[bonobo|pygmy chimpanzee]], [[coelacanth]], [[Komodo dragon]] and [[giant panda]]; and those that are believed to have become extinct relatively recently, such as the [[moa]] and [[thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]]. A major theme is that these animals were generally known to local peoples, but their stories were dismissed by visiting zoologists, particularly the [[okapi]].&lt;ref name=AmSci&gt;C. J. Reed ''American Scientist'' Vol. 47, No. 4, 1959, p 378A (book review)&lt;/ref&gt;

The author then discusses evidence for mystery animals from all over the world including the [[Mokele-mbembe]], [[sea serpent]]s and the [[Yeti]], with an extensive bibliography. He begins by complaining that "The Press has made such a laughing-stock of the [[Loch Ness Monster]]... that no scientific commission has ever dared tackle the problem" and ends with the wish that any new species are not merely slaughtered for trophies: "Have pity on them all, for it is we who are the real monsters."

Reviewers praised the breadth of study, careful citation and the author's knowledge&lt;ref name=Science/&gt;&lt;ref name=AmSci/&gt; but it was criticized for being somewhat shallow and "overly long and rambling."&lt;ref name=Science/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall1958"&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">An '''open-ended question''' cannot be answered with a "yes" or "no" response, or with a static response. Open-ended questions are phrased as a statement which requires a response. The response can be compared to information that is already known to the questioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ackley | first = Betty | title = Nursing diagnosis handbook : an evidence-based guide to planning care | publisher = Mosby | location = Maryland Heights, Mo | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780323071505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of open-ended questions:
*Tell me about your relationship with your supervisor.  
*How do you see your future?
*Tell me about the children in this photograph.
*What is the purpose of government?
*Why did you choose that answer?
*Tap?

== Education: open questioning ==
The received wisdom in education is that open questions are broadly speaking ‘good’ questions. They invite students to give longer responses that demonstrate their understanding. They are preferable to [[Closed-ended question|closed questions]] (i.e. one that demands a yes/no answer) because they are better for discussions or enquiries, whereas closed questions are only good for knowledge testing. 

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are “grammatically closed, but conceptually open”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2016-12-03|title=Ariadne’s Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in standard parlance, ‘is it ever right to lie?’ would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes/no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes/no answer to it can be ‘opened up’ by the questioner (‘why do you think that?,’ ‘Could there be an instance where that’s not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry. 

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, “gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=2017-04-19|work=Tes|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Closed questions, simply require ‘opening up’ strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential. 

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention 'Open Questioning Mindset', or OQM. OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student’s contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls ‘guess what’s in my head’ teaching, that relies on [[Closed-ended question|closed]] and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=2015-11-29|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Nature of geography ==

=== Geography is  ===

* an [[academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; a body of knowledge given to − or received by − a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities − not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Bonnett|first= Alastair |title =  What is Geography?|location= London|publisher = Sage|date = 2008|isbn =9781412918688}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[fields of science|field of science]] &amp;ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals.
** a [[natural science]] &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of natural environment (physical geography).
** a [[social science]] &amp;ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography).
* an [[interdisciplinary field]] &amp;ndash; a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science.

== Branches of geography ==

As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches:
*human geography
*physical geography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|title = Geography: The Mother of Sciences|deadurl = yes|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030901102227/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|archivedate = 1 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html |title=Elements of Geography|last= Pidwirny|first= M.|date=2006|work = Fundamentals of Physical Geography|edition = 2nd |publisher=Physicalgeography.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other branches include:
*integrated geography
*geomatics
*regional geography

All the branches are further described below...

=== Physical geography ===

* [[Physical geography]] &amp;ndash; examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation &amp; life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.&lt;ref name="AAG"/&gt;

==== Fields of physical geography ====

* [[Geomorphology]] &amp;ndash; study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. Seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling.
* [[Hydrology]] &amp;ndash; study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability.
** [[Glaciology]] &amp;ndash; study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.
** [[Oceanography]] &amp;ndash; studies a wide range of topics pertaining to oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.
* [[Biogeography]] &amp;ndash; study of the distribution of species spatially and temporally. Over areal [[ecology|ecological]] changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living '[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live, and at what abundance.&lt;ref&gt;Martiny JBH et al. [http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf Microbial biogeography: putting microorganisms on the map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621194350/http://alrlab.pdx.edu/media/HughesBiogeoNature.pdf |date=2010-06-21 }} ''Nature: FEBRUARY 2006 | VOLUME 4''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Climatology]] &amp;ndash; study of [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of [[time]].&lt;ref&gt;Climate Prediction Center. [http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml#C Climate Glossary.] Retrieved on 2006-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meteorology]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology).
* [[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]] &amp;ndash; study of soils in their natural environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://natres.psu.ac.th/Link/SoilCongress/bdd/symp45/75-t.pdf | title = Soil Preservation and the Future of Pedology | author = Ronald Amundsen |accessdate = 2006-06-08|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; that deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], and [[soil classification]].
* [[Palaeogeography]] &amp;ndash; study of what the geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape, but also the human or cultural environment.
* [[Coastal geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast.
* [[Quaternary science]] &amp;ndash; focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period.
* [[Landscape ecology]] &amp;ndash; the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on a multitude of landscape scales and organizational levels.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and sustainability science. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Approaches of physical geography ====

* [[Quantitative geography]] &amp;ndash; [[Quantitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography. See also the [[quantitative revolution]].
* [[Systems approach]] &amp;ndash;

=== Human geography ===

* [[Human geography]] &amp;ndash; one of the two main subfields of geography, it is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes which have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the [[built environment]] and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.&lt;ref name="AAG"&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=Association of American Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fields of human geography ====

* [[Cultural geography]] &amp;ndash; study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant, from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Children's geographies]] &amp;ndash; study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterized experientially, politically and ethically. Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially, politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, family, and class. The range of focii within children's geographies include:
*** Children and the city
*** Children and the countryside
*** Children and technology
*** Children and nature,
*** Children and globalization
*** Methodologies of researching children's worlds
*** Ethics of researching children's worlds
*** [[Otherness of childhood]]
** [[Animal geographies]] &amp;ndash; studies the spaces and places occupied by animals in human culture, because social life and space is heavily populated by animals of many differing kinds and in many differing ways (e.g. farm animals, pets, wild animals in the city). Another impetus that has influenced the development of the field are ecofeminist and other environmentalist viewpoints on nature-society relations (including questions of animal welfare and rights).
** [[Language geography]] &amp;ndash; studies the geographic distribution of language or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language:
**# Geography of languages &amp;ndash; deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,&lt;ref&gt;Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.''

Subjects of interest include but are not limited to the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as "linkages"), transportation, international trade and development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.
** [[Marketing geography]] &amp;ndash; a discipline within marketing analysis which uses geolocation (geographic information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.&lt;ref name= "qr10"&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used in any aspect of the marketing mix – the product, price, promotion, or place (geo targeting).
** [[Transportation geography]] &amp;ndash; branch of economic geography that investigates spatial interactions between people, freight and information. It studies humans and their use of vehicles or other modes of traveling as well as how markets are serviced by flows of finished goods and raw materials.
* [[Health geography]] &amp;ndash; application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care, to provide a spatial understanding of a population's health, the distribution of disease in an area, and the environment's effect on health and disease. It also deals with accessibility to health care and spatial distribution of health care providers.
** [[Time geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the temporal factor on spatial human activities within the following constraints:
# Authority - limits of accessibility to certain places or domains placed on individuals by owners or authorities
# Capability - limitations on the movement of individuals, based on their nature. For example, movement is restricted by biological factors, such as the need for food, drink, and sleep
# Coupling - restraint of an individual, anchoring him or her to a location while interacting with other individuals in order to complete a task
* [[Historical geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past, and seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved, by understanding how a place or region changes through time, including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape.
* [[Political geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Basically, the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.
** [[Electoral geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the relationship between election results and the regions they affect (such as the environmental impact of voting decisions), and of the effects of regional factors upon voting behavior.
** [[Geopolitics]] &amp;ndash; analysis of geography, history and social science with reference to spatial politics and patterns at various scales, ranging from the level of the state to international.
** [[Strategic geography]] &amp;ndash; concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of nations.
** [[Military geography]] &amp;ndash; the application of geographic tools, information, and techniques to solve military problems in peacetime or war.
* [[Population geography]] &amp;ndash; study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places.
* [[Tourism geography]] &amp;ndash; study of travel and tourism, as an industry and as a social and cultural activity, and their effect on places, including the [[environmental impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.
* [[Urban geography]] &amp;ndash; the study of urban areas, in terms of concentration, infrastructure, economy, and environmental impacts.

* [[Qualitative geography]] &amp;ndash; [[qualitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography.

=== Integrated geography ===

* [[Integrated geography]] &amp;ndash; branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, ecology, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.

=== Geomatics ===

* [[Geomatics]] &amp;ndash; branch of geography and the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information. It is a widespread interdisciplinary field that includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, photogrammetry, and related forms of earth mapping.

=== Regional geography ===

[[Regional geography]] &amp;ndash; study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Regional geography breaks down into the study of specific regions.

[[Region]] &amp;ndash; an area, defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, or functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

==== Supercontinents ====

[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|300px|Earth may have had a single supercontinent called "[[Pangaea]]"]]

[[List of supercontinents]]
A ''supercontinent'' is a [[landmass]] comprising more than one [[continent]]al core, or [[craton]].

*[[Afro-Eurasia]] ''(formed 5 million years ago)
*[[Americas]] ''(formed 15 million years ago)
*[[Eurasia]] ''(formed 60 million years ago)

==== Continents ====

[[Continent]] &amp;ndash; one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]]. They are generally identified by [[Convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

* [[Afrotropic]] 22.1 mil. km² (including [[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
* [[Indomalaya]] 7.5 mil. km² (including the [[Indian subcontinent|South Asian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]])
* [[Australasia ecozone|Australasia]] 7.7 mil. km² (including [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], and neighboring islands). The northern boundary of this zone is known as the [[Wallace line]].
* [[Neotropic]] 19.0 mil. km² (including [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]])
* [[Oceania ecozone|Oceania]] 1.0 mil. km² (including [[Polynesia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Micronesia]])
* [[Antarctic ecozone|Antarctic]] 0.3 mil. km² (including [[Antarctica]]).

===== Ecoregions =====

[[Ecoregion]]
Ecozones are further divided into ecoregions. The World has over 800 [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. ''See [[Lists of ecoregions by country]].''

==== Natural geographic features ====

Natural geographic feature &amp;ndash; an ecosystem or natural landform.

===== Ecosystems =====

[[Ecosystem]] &amp;ndash; community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. 
* {{Annotated link|Biodiversity hotspot}}
* [[Ecozone]] &amp;ndash; broadest biogeographic division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. 
** [[Ecoprovince]] &amp;ndash; biogeographic unit smaller than an ecozone that contains one or more ecoregions.

{{See also|List of landforms}}

[[Landform|Natural landform]] &amp;ndash; terrain or body of water. Landforms are topographical elements, and are defined by their surface form and location in the landscape. Landforms are categorized by traits such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. Some landforms are artificial, such as certain islands, but most landforms are natural.

==== Artificial geographic features ====
Artificial geographic feature &amp;ndash; a thing that was made by humans that may be indicated on a map. It may be physical and exist in the real world (like a bridge or city), or it may be abstract and exist only on maps (such as the Equator, which has a defined location, but cannot be seen where it lies).

* {{annotated link|Human settlement|Settlement}}
** {{annotated link|Hamlet (place)}} &amp;ndash; rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill.
** {{annotated link|Village}} &amp;ndash; clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet with the population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand (sometimes tens of thousands).
** {{annotated link|Town}} &amp;ndash; human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size a settlement must be in order to be called a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many American "small towns" seem to British people to be no more than villages, while many British "small towns" would qualify as cities in the United States.
*** {{annotated link|Urban hierarchy}} &amp;ndash; ranks the structure of towns within an area.
**** {{annotated link|1st-order towns}} &amp;ndash; bare minimum of essential services, such as bread and milk.
**** {{annotated link|2nd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|3rd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|4th-order towns}}
** {{annotated link|City}} &amp;ndash; relatively large and permanent settlement. In many regions, a city is distinguished from a town by attainment of designation according to law, for instance being required to obtain articles of incorporation or a royal charter.
*** {{annotated link|Financial centre}}
*** {{annotated link|Primate city}} &amp;ndash; the leading city in its country or region, disproportionately larger than any others in the urban hierarchy.
*** {{annotated link|Metropolis}} &amp;ndash; very large city or urban area which is a significant economic, political and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections and communications.
*** {{annotated link|Metropolitan area}} &amp;ndash; region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, G. Ed. Urban Sprawl: Causes, Consequences, &amp; Policy Responses. The Urban Institute Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
*** {{annotated link|Global city}} &amp;ndash; city that is deemed to be an important node in the global economic system. Globalization is largely created, facilitated and enacted in strategic geographic locales (including global cities) according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade.
*** {{annotated link|Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolis}} &amp;ndash; chain of roughly adjacent metropolitan areas. An example is the huge metropolitan area along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. extending from Boston, Massachusetts through New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland and ending in Washington, D.C..
*** {{annotated link|Eperopolis}} &amp;ndash; theoretical "continent city". The world does not have one yet. Will Europe become the first one?
*** {{annotated link|Ecumenopolis}} &amp;ndash; theoretical "world city". Will the world ever become so urbanized as to be called this?
* Engineered construct &amp;ndash; built feature of the landscape such as a [[highway]], [[bridge]], [[airport]], [[railroad]], [[building]], [[dam]], or [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]. See also [[construction engineering]] and [[infrastructure]].
** Artificial landforms
*** {{annotated link|Artificial dwelling hill}}
*** {{annotated link|Artificial island}}
*** {{annotated link|Artificial reef}}
** {{annotated link|Airport}} &amp;ndash; place where airplanes can take off and land, including one or more runways and one or more passenger terminals.
** {{annotated link|Aqueduct (watercourse)|Aqueduct}} &amp;ndash; artificial channel that is constructed to convey water from one location to another.
** {{annotated link|Breakwater (structure)|Breakwater}} &amp;ndash; construction designed to break the force of the sea to provide calm water for boats or ships, or to prevent erosion of a coastal feature.
** {{annotated link|Bridge}} &amp;ndash; structure built to span a valley, road, body of water, or other physical obstacle such as a canyon, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle.
** {{annotated link|Building}} &amp;ndash; closed structure with walls and a roof.
** {{annotated link|Canal}} &amp;ndash; artificial waterway, often connecting one body of water with another.
** {{annotated link|Causeway}}

== Persons influential in geography ==
{{Main|Geographer|List of geographers|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

A [[geographer]] is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]]. They study the physical details of the environment and also its effect on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Farmer's High School and Old Main.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main c. 1855]]
The school was founded as a degree-granting institution on February 22, 1855, by act P.L. 46, No. 50 of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] as the '''[[Farmers' High School]] of Pennsylvania'''. [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], Pennsylvania, became the home of the new school when [[James Irvin]] of [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]], Pennsylvania, donated {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}} of land{{spaced ndash}}the first of {{convert|10101|acre|km2|0}} the school would eventually acquire. In 1862, the school's name was changed to the '''Agricultural College of Pennsylvania''', and with the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]], Pennsylvania selected the school in 1863 to be the state's sole [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] college. The school's name changed to the '''Pennsylvania State College''' in 1874; enrollment fell to 64 undergraduates the following year as the school tried to balance purely [[Agricultural science|agricultural studies]] with a more classic education.&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt;

[[George W. Atherton]] became president of the school in 1882, and broadened the curriculum. Shortly after he introduced [[Engineering|engineering studies]], Penn State became one of the ten largest engineering schools in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History Of Mechanical Engineering – Chapter 1: 1886–1907 (L. E. Reber) |publisher=Pennsylvania State University, Department of Mechanical &amp; Nuclear Engineering |url=http://www.mne.psu.edu/History/chapter1.html |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104200643/http://www.mne.psu.edu/History/chapter1.html |archivedate=November 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherton also expanded the [[liberal arts]] and agriculture programs, for which the school began receiving regular appropriations from the state in 1887.&lt;ref name=atherton&gt;{{cite web|title=George W. Atherton |url=http://www2.libraries.psu.edu/psul/speccolls/psua/pshistory/presidents/atherton.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}} {{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[U.S. Route 322|major road]] in [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] has been named in Atherton's honor. Additionally, Penn State's [[Atherton Hall (Penn State)|Atherton Hall]], a well-furnished and centrally located residence hall, is named not after George Atherton himself, but after his wife, Frances Washburn Atherton.&lt;ref name="intercom_atherton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Descendants of Atherton and Buckhout Discover Their Roots at University Park|url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/archives/intercom_2002/Oct10/atherton.html|work=Penn State Intercom, October 10, 2002 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave is in front of Schwab Auditorium near [[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]], marked by an engraved [[marble]] block in front of his statue.

=== Early 20th century ===
In the years that followed, Penn State grew significantly, becoming the state's largest grantor of baccalaureate degrees and reaching an enrollment of 5,000 in 1936.&lt;ref name="history_short"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania State University – Mission and Public Character|url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/about/historyshort.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, a system of commonwealth campuses was started by President [[Ralph Dorn Hetzel]] to provide an alternative for [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt;

In 1953, President [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], brother of then-[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], sought and won permission to elevate the school to university status as '''The Pennsylvania State University'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bezilla|first1=Michael|title=Penn State: An Illustrated History|date=1985|publisher=Pennsylvania State university Press |isbn=0-271-00392-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his successor [[Eric A. Walker (engineer)|Eric A. Walker]] (1956–1970), the university acquired hundreds of acres of surrounding land, and enrollment nearly tripled.&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt; In addition, in 1967, the [[Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center]], a college of medicine and hospital, was established in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] with a $50&amp;nbsp;million gift from the [[Hershey Trust Company]].&lt;ref name="history_short" /&gt;

=== Modern era ===
In the 1970s, the university became a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] institution. As such, it now belongs to the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]]. In 1975, the lyrics in Penn State's alma mater song were revised to be gender-neutral in honor of [[International Women's Year]]; the revised lyrics were taken from the posthumously-published autobiography of the writer of the original lyrics, Fred Lewis Pattee, and Professor Patricia Farrell acted as a spokesperson for those who wanted the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/about/almamater.html|title=For The Glory of Old State|website=psu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Pennsylvania College of Technology]] in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]] joined ranks with the university, and in 2000, so did the Dickinson School of Law.&lt;ref name="dickinson_history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Penn State Law – History |url=http://law.psu.edu/prospective_students/history|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609222249/http://law.psu.edu/prospective_students/history|archivedate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is now the largest in Pennsylvania, and in 2003, it was credited with having the second-largest impact on the state economy of any organization, generating an economic effect of over $17 billion on a budget of $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="economic_impact"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pennsylvania State University Economic Impact Statement|url=http://econimpact.psu.edu/|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To offset the lack of funding due to the limited growth in state appropriations to Penn State, the university has concentrated its efforts on philanthropy (2003 marked the end of the Grand Destiny campaign—a seven-year effort that raised over $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic Grand Destiny Campaign Raises $1.371 Billion for Penn State |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/219453/2003/07/11/historic-grand-destiny-campaign-raises-1371-billion-penn-state|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Child sex abuse scandal ====
{{Main|Penn State child sex abuse scandal}}

In 2011, the university and its football team garnered major international media attention and criticism due to a [[Penn State sex abuse scandal|sex abuse scandal]] in which university officials were alleged to have covered up incidents of [[child sexual abuse]] by former football team defensive coordinator [[Jerry Sandusky]]. Athletic director [[Timothy Curley]] and Gary Schultz, Senior Vice President for Finance and Business, were indicted for perjury.

A subcommittee of the Board of Trustees engaged former [[FBI]] director [[Louis Freeh]] to head an independent investigation on the university's handling of the incidents. Freeh released his findings in July 2012, announcing that Paterno, along with Spanier, Curley and Schultz "conceal[ed] Sandusky's activities from the Board of Trustees, the University community and authorities" and "failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade".&lt;ref name=FreehReport&gt;[http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/other/REPORT_FINAL_071212.pdf Report of the Special Investigative Counsel Regarding the Pennsylvania State University Related to the Child Sexual Abuse Committed by Gerald A.

Transportation access:

The University Park campus is centrally located at the junction of [[Interstate 99]] and [[U.S. Route 322]], and is due south of [[Interstate 80]]. Before the arrival of the Interstates, University Park was a short distance from the [[Lock Haven, PA|Lock Haven]] – [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] branch line of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The last run of long-distance trains from Buffalo or Harrisburg through Lock Haven was in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christopher T.|last=Baer|title=Named Trains of the PRR including Through Services|year=2009|url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20NAMED%20TRAINS.pdf|format=PDF|website=prrths.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the nearest passenger rail access is in [[Lewistown, PA|Lewistown]], 31 miles to the southeast. The [[University Park Airport]], serving four [[regional airlines]], is near University Park.

==== Special Mission Campuses ====
* [[Pennsylvania State University – Dickinson Law|Dickinson Law]], founded in 1834 as The Dickinson School of Law in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], is the oldest law school in Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=PA Historical Markers Program|last=|first=|date=October 20, 1949|publisher=Pennsylvania Historical &amp; Museum Commission|access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fifth oldest in the country. Over the years, its graduates have included the nation's finest attorneys, judges, government and corporate leaders, and legal educators. The Dickinson School of Law's 1997 merger with Penn State was completed in 2000 and expanded its reputation, network, and joint degree programs—complementing Dickinson Law's legacy as an innovative leader in experiential education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/experience/history |title=History|website=dickinsonlaw.psu.edu|language=en|access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 a second campus was opened at University Park.

==== World Campus ====
In 1998, the university launched [[Penn State World Campus]], or Penn State Online, which offers more than 60 online education programs, degrees, and certificates. Distance education has a long history at Penn State, one of the first universities in the country to offer a correspondence course for remote farmers in 1892. Examples of online programs include an MBA, master of professional studies in homeland security, a bachelor of science in nursing, and post-baccalaureate certificates in geographic information systems and applied behavior analysis. Penn State's World Campus offers 18 graduate degrees, 21 graduate certificates, 17 undergraduate degrees, and 11 undergraduate certificates. World Campus students come from all 50 U.S. states, more than 40 countries, and six continents.

== Organization and administration ==
Penn State is a "state-related" university, part of Pennsylvania's [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]]. As such, although it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, it is otherwise independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="state approps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp |title=Spanier Testifies for More Funding |last=Horan |first=Kevin |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031041834/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports concerning the 2007–2008 fiscal year indicated that Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]] is recommending a 1.6 percent increase in state appropriations.&lt;ref name="approps 0708"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp |title=Penn State To Receive Increased Appropriations |last=Boyer |first=Lauren |date=February 6, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031041856/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp |archivedate=October 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State's appropriation request, submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education in September, requested a 6.8 percent increase in funding.&lt;ref name="approp request 07-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.psu.edu/President/AppropRequest200708/Table2.asp |title=2007–08 Appropriation Request |accessdate=February 6, 2007 |publisher=University Budget Office.

In addition, the university's Board of Trustees voted in January 2007 to create a [[School of International Affairs]], with the first classes admitted in the fall 2008 semester.&lt;ref name="intl affairs announce"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/198805/2007/01/19/university-establish-school-international-affairs|title=University To Establish School of International Affairs |publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school is part of Penn State Law.&lt;ref name="intl affairs director"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/198805/2007/01/19/university-establish-school-international-affairs|title=Penn State Names Inaugural Director for School of International Affairs|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=March 28, 2007|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly the School of Nursing, on September 25, 2013, the Board of Trustees granted the nursing program college status.&lt;ref name="college of nursing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sn.psu.edu/Information/News/31766.htm |title=Nursing program granted college status by PSU Board of Trustees |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |date=September 25, 2013 |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |archivedate=October 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215358/http://www.sn.psu.edu/Information/News/31766.htm |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Board of Trustees ===
{{Main|Penn State Board of Trustees}}
The university is governed by the 32-member board of trustees. Its members include the university's president, the [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Governor of the Commonwealth]], and the state Secretaries of Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and Education. The other members include six trustees appointed by the Governor, nine elected by alumni, and six elected by Pennsylvania agricultural societies. Six additional trustees are elected by a board representing business and industry enterprises.&lt;ref name=trusteesmembership&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/selection.html|title=Membership Selection|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate students do not elect any trustees; the court case ''[[Benner v. Oswald]]'' ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the selection of trustees.

{{as of|2013}}, the chair of the board of trustees is Keith E. Masser, a graduate of Penn State and the Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer of Sterman Masser, Inc.&lt;ref name="trusteescommittees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/committees.html |title=Committee Memberships &amp; Other Assignments|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main responsibilities of the board are to select the president of Penn State, to determine the goals and strategic direction of the university, and to approve the annual budget.&lt;ref name=trusteesrole&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/governance.html |title=Role of the Board of Trustees in University Governance|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular meetings of the board are held bi-monthly and take place primarily on the University Park campus, although on occasion meetings are held at other locations within the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="trusteesmeetings"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/meetings.html|title=Meeting Dates, Agendas, and Minutes|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administration ===

[[File:Old Main - Penn State.png|300px|thumb|[[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]], the main administrative building of Penn State, located at University Park.]]

The president of the university is selected by the board and is given the authority for actual control of the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, part of this responsibility is delegated by the president to other departments of the administration, to the faculty, and to the student body.&lt;ref name=trusteesrole /&gt; [[Eric J.

=== Student government ===
[[File:Penn state hub building exterior.jpg|thumb|Penn State's student union building, the [[HUB-Robeson Center]]]]

Penn State has a long history of student governance. Elected student leaders remain directly involved in the decision-making of the university administration, as provided for in the Board of Trustee's Standing Orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/trustees/pdf/standingorders.pdf Standing Orders (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are three Student Governments recognized by the university administration: the University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA), the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), and the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG).

The University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA) is the representative student government of the 39,102&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Undergraduate and Graduate/First Professional Enrollment Fall Enrollment 2012 and 2011 |url=http://budget.psu.edu/factbook/StudentDynamic/UGGREnrollSummary.aspx?YearCode=2012Enr&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005035001/http://www.budget.psu.edu/FactBook/StudentDynamic/UGGREnrollSummary.aspx?YearCode=2012Enr&amp;FBPlusIndc=N |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; undergraduate students at Penn State's University Park campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Park Undergraduate Association|url=http://upua.psu.edu/|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was established in 2006 after the former student government, Undergraduate Student Government (USG), lost its recognition by way of a student referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UPUA History |url=http://upua.org/history/|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227101957/http://upua.org/history/|archivedate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UPUA is composed of an Assembly of Student Representatives, an Executive Board, and a Judicial Board. The Executive Board is the bureaucratic branch of the UPUA and is led by Student Body President Katie Jordan. The Assembly, which is led by Chair Brent Rice, is the [[legislative]] body of UPUA and is composed of elected representatives whose constituencies include the academic units of Penn State, Greek Life, Freshmen Representatives, and At-Large Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Assembly |url=http://pennstateupua.com/generalassembly|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222144/http://pennstateupua.com/generalassembly|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 4, 2013|publisher=The University Park Undergraduate Association|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UPUA meets every Wednesday at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm in 233A HUB.

The graduate and professional students of the university are governed by the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA), which is the oldest continuously existing student governance organization at Penn State.&lt;ref name=gpsa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpsa.psu.edu |title=GPSA – Home |website=GPSA.PSU.EDU |accessdate=July 24, 2012 |archivedate=August 6, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806081621/http://gpsa.psu.edu/ |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPSA "work[s] on the behalf of the students to make sure that the graduate voice is heard by all levels of the administration and faculty at Penn State and to put on events geared towards graduate and professional students."&lt;ref name=gpsa /&gt;

The 19 [[Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth campuses|commonwealth campuses]] of the university are governed by the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG), formerly known as the Council of Branch Campus Student Governments (CBCSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psuccsg.org/ |title=CCSG &amp;#124; Council of Commonwealth Student Governments |website=Php.scripts.psu.edu |accessdate=January 1, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929032127/http://php.scripts.psu.edu/clubs/up/ccsg/index.php |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
Penn State is [[regional accreditation|regionally accredited]] by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]].

{{as of|2009|September}}, only 24 Pennsylvania colleges and universities held [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] accreditation in business and only four in accounting. The [[Smeal College of Business]], The [[Sam and Irene Black School of Business]], [[Penn State Harrisburg]], and [[Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies|Penn State Great Valley]] were among the institutions accredited.&lt;ref name=aacsb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacsb.edu/General/InstLists.asp?lid=3 |title=Schools Accredited in Business – ordered by country, state, name |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222080454/http://www.aacsb.edu/General/InstLists.asp?lid=3 |archivedate=February 22, 2007 |accessdate=February 28, 2007 |publisher=The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university offers an accelerated [[Pre-medical|Premedical]]-[[Medical education in the United States|Medical]] Program in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson University|Sidney Kimmel Medical College]].&lt;ref name="pmm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.science.psu.edu/premed/6yrpremedprogram.html |title=Penn State's Accelerated Premedical-Medical Program |publisher=Penn State Eberly College of Science |accessdate=April 28, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414083712/http://www.science.psu.edu/premed/6yrpremedprogram.html |archivedate=April 14, 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the program spend two or three years at the university before attending medical school at Jefferson.

Recently, a joint venture between the [[Eberly College of Science]] and the [[Smeal College of Business]] created an integrated undergraduate/graduate program to give highly motivated students the opportunity to receive a bachelor's degree in Science and an MBA two to five years sooner than those pursuing a traditional path. The BS/MBA Program prepares individuals to be future leaders of the world's scientific organizations and is led by Mr. Peter Tombros and Dr. James Gardner.

=== Demographics ===
As of fall 2010, the racial makeup of the Penn State system including all campuses and special-mission colleges, was 75.4 percent white, 5.5 percent black, 4.3 percent Asian, 4.4 percent Hispanic, 0.2 percent Native American, 0.1 percent Native Hawaiian/Pac Island, 1.7 percent two or more races, 5.8 percent international students and 3.1 percent of an unknown race.

Penn State has been the subject of controversy for several issues of discrimination. Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main and demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus, as well as in the local community.  After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus.

The Materials Research Institute was created to coordinate the highly diverse and growing materials activities across Penn State's University Park campus. With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials. His vision for Interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute, and the establishment of Penn State as an acknowledged leader among major universities in materials education and research.&lt;ref name="aboutmri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mri.psu.edu/AboutMRI/index.asp |title=About MRI |author=Materials Research Institute |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912072004/http://www.mri.psu.edu/AboutMRI/index.asp |archivedate=September 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mri.psu.edu/|title=Materials Research Institute|author=Materials Research Institute|accessdate=August 27, 2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matse.psu.edu/ret/tresslerbio |title=Dr. Richard E.

==== THON ====
[[File:THON 2007 BJC.jpg|Penn State Dance MaraTHON|thumb|right]]
Every February, thousands of students participate in the [[Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon]] (THON), which has been "dubbed by supporters as the world's largest student-run philanthropy."&lt;ref name="THONam"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Hurst|title=PSU Gives Back with THON|date=September 22, 2009|work=[[Altoona Mirror]] |url=http://www.altoonamirror.com/page/content.detail/id/516354.html|accessdate=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous years, participants stood for 48 hours nonstop and performed a line dance at least once every hour to stay alert. In 2007, THON was moved to the Jordan Center and now lasts 46 hours. THON raises millions of dollars annually for pediatric cancer care and research, generally through the [[Four Diamonds Fund]]. In 2014, THON raised a program record of $13.3 million.

==== The Lion's Pantry ====

The Lion's Pantry is an undergraduate student-run on-campus food pantry (and a registered student organization). The Lion's Pantry serves undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. With increasing awareness of hunger on college campuses, the Lion's Pantry is one of the most successful startup food pantries in the nation. They partner with groups ranging from Boulevard, UPUA, Greek Life, and more to receive over 8,000 food donations a year. The club was also awarded the Class Gift of 2017 in the form of an endowment.&lt;ref name="2017 Class Gift"&gt;{{cite news|first=Laura|last=Waldhier|title=Class of 2017 Pledges Support to Lion's Pantry, the Student Food Bank|date=October 26, 2016|work=[[PSU News]]|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/434135/2016/10/26/campus-life/class-2017-pledges-support-lions-pantry-student-food-bank|accessdate=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student media ===
Student media groups on campus include ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]'', Penn State's student-run newspaper; ''[[Onward State]]'', a student-run blog; ''The Underground'', a multi-cultural student media site; [[WKPS|The LION 90.7 FM (WKPS-FM)]], a student-run radio station; CommRadio, a student-run, internet-based radio program; ''La Vie'', the university's annual student yearbook; ''Kalliope'', a student-produced literary journal; ''Valley'', a student-run style and life magazine; ''Phroth'', a student-run humor magazine; and ''Penn State Live'', the official news source of the university published by its public relations team. 

''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]'' has continuously been ranked as one of the top college newspapers by the Princeton Review. The paper, which was founded in 1904, provides news, sports and arts coverage, and produces long-form features. It publishes in print on Mondays and Thursdays while classes are in session. Since the summer of 1996, the traditional paper publication has been supplemented by an online edition. Online content is published everyday. Penn State's commonwealth campuses receive a weekly copy of the paper, titled ''The Weekly Collegian''.

''[[Onward State]]'' is a student-run blog geared towards members of the university's community. The blog, which was founded in 2008, provides news, event coverage and opinion pieces. ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' named the blog the "Best Alternative Media Outlet" in February 2009.   

The Underground is a multicultural student-run media site devoted to telling the untold stories within the Penn State community. The publication seeks to foster the multicultural student voice through creating an open forum of discussion and promoting diversity and community involvement. The media site was founded in 2015.

[[WKPS|The LION 90.7 FM (WKPS-FM)]] was founded in 1995 as a replacement for Penn State's original student radio station WDFM. The LION broadcasts from the ground floor of the [[HUB–Robeson Center]], serving the Penn State and State College communities with alternative music and talk programming, including live coverage of home Penn State football games. 

CommRadio is operated by the [[Penn State College of Communications]]. It was founded in the spring of 2003 as an internet-based audio laboratory and co-curricular training environment for aspiring student broadcasters. It airs both sports coverage and news. Other programming includes student talk shows, political coverage, AP syndicated news, and soft rock music. In recent years, ComRadio broadcasters have won numerous state awards for their on-air work. 

''La Vie'' (the Life), the university's annual student yearbook, has been in production documenting student life continuously since 1890.&lt;ref name="psu_lavie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://psulavie.org/|publisher=PSU Lavie|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Vie 1987,'' edited by David Beagin, won a College Gold Crown for Yearbooks award from the [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1988 Collegiate Crown Recipients |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cspa/docs/contests-and-critiques/crown-awards/recipients/1988-collegiate-crown.html |publisher=[[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]] |accessdate=August 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114110936/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cspa/docs/contests-and-critiques/crown-awards/recipients/1988-collegiate-crown.html |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kalliope'' is an undergraduate literary journal produced by students and sponsored by the university's English Department. It is published in the spring. ''Kalliope'' includes works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and visual art.&lt;ref name="Kalliope Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kalliope Magazine |url=http://english.la.psu.edu/kalliope/about.html |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |author=Kalliope |publisher=Penn State English Department |archivedate=December 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225033947/http://english.la.psu.edu/kalliope/about.html |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''Klio'', an online publication, provides students with literary pieces in the fall semester.

''Valley'' is Penn State's student-run life and style magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valley Magazine |url=http://www.valleymagazinepsu.com|work=Valley Magazine|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2007.

The student-run humor magazine is ''Phroth'', which publishes two to four issues each year. Its roots date back to 1909 when it was called ''Froth''. Several ''Froth'' writers and editors have gone on to win fame: [[Julius J. Epstein]] wrote the screenplay for the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) and won three [[Academy Award]]s; [[Jimmy Dugan]] wrote for the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', and ''The New York Times''; and [[Ronald Bonn]] was a producer with ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' and ''[[CBS Evening News]]''.&lt;ref name="Phroth Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phroth Magazine |url=http://www.phroth.com/history/ |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |author=Phroth |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611065006/http://www.phroth.com/history/ |archivedate=June 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Penn State's newspaper readership program provides free copies of ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', as well as local and regional newspapers depending on the campus location (for example, the ''[[Centre Daily Times]]'' in University Park). This program, initiated by then-President Graham Spanier in 1997,&lt;ref name="newspaper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newspapers.psu.edu/|title=Newspaper Readership Program|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; has since been instituted on several other universities across the country.&lt;ref name="newspaper2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collegiate Readership Program: Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://college.usatoday.com/the-collegiate-readership-program-frequently-asked-questions/|website=USAToday.com|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Penn State Nittany Lions}}

Penn State's mascot is the [[Nittany Lion]], a representation of a type of [[mountain lion]] that once roamed what is now University Park. The school's official colors, now blue and white, were originally black and dark pink.  Penn State participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I FBS]] and in the [[Big Ten Conference]] for most sports.&lt;ref name="ncaa directory"&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAA Members by Division|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/onlineDir/exec/divisionListing|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|quote=Select Division I and press Run Report|accessdate=August 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611161846/http://web1.ncaa.org/onlineDir/exec/divisionListing#|archive-date=June 11, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two sports participate in different conferences: men's volleyball in the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] (EIVA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EIVA, Penn State Member Page|url=http://www.eivavolleyball.com/members/penn_state/index|website=Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women's hockey in [[College Hockey America]] (CHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Women's Hockey Quick Facts|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/psu/sports/w-hockey/auto_pdf/2015-16/quick_facts/quick_facts.pdf|website=GoPSUsports.com|publisher=Penn State Athletics |format=PDF|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fencing teams operate as independents.

Athletic teams at Penn State have won 77 national collegiate team championships (49 [[NCAA]], 2 consensus [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|Division I football]] titles, 6 [[AIAW Champions|AIAW]], 3 USWLA, 1 [[Women's International Bowling Congress|WIBC]], and 4 national titles in boxing, 11 in men's soccer and one in wrestling in years prior to NCAA sponsorship).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/national-champions.html Penn State championship history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324043952/http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/national-champions.html# |date=March 24, 2009 }}". Penn State Athletics.&lt;/ref&gt; The 49 NCAA Championships ranks fifth all time in NCAA Division I, and is the most of any [[Big Ten]] school.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/champs_records_book/summaries/combined.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627170832/http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/champs_records_book/summaries/combined.pdf |archivedate=June 27, 2010}}" [[NCAA]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since joining the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] in 1991, Penn State teams have won 103 conference regular season and tournament titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/big-ten-champions.html|title=Penn State Has Won 103 Big Ten Regular Season and Tournament Championships|last=|first=|date=|website=GoPSUsports.com|publisher=Penn State Athletics|accessdate=April 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704120746/http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/big-ten-champions.html#|archive-date=July 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State has one of the most successful overall athletic programs in the country, as evidenced by its rankings in the [[NACDA Director's Cup]], a list compiled by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. From the Cup's inception in the 1993–1994 season, the Nittany Lions have finished in the top 25 every year.&lt;ref name=dcup&gt;{{cite web|title=Nittany Lions No. 9 in Final Directors' Cup Standings; Penn State Earns Eighth Top 10 Finish in the Survey's 15 Years|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/genrel/062608aab.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=June 26, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite widespread success in the overall athletic program, however, the school is best known for its [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|football team]], which draws a very large following. Penn State's Beaver Stadium has the second largest [[seating capacity]] of any stadium in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fortuna |first=Matt |accessdate=September 24, 2008 |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx |title=Beaver To Rule Arenas |date=March 17, 2008 |work=[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202110638/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx |archivedate=December 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an official capacity of 106,572 slightly behind Michigan Stadium with an official capacity of 107,601. For decades, the football team was led by coach [[Joe Paterno]]. Paterno was in a close competition with [[Bobby Bowden]], the head coach for [[Florida State]], for the most wins ever in Division I-A (now the FBS) history. This competition effectively ended with Paterno still leading following Bowden's retirement after the [[2010 Gator Bowl]]. In 2007, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paterno inducted into College Football Hall of Fame |url=http://news.psu.edu/story/192048/2007/11/30/paterno-inducted-college-football-hall-fame|publisher= Pennsylvania State University |date=November 30, 2007|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterno amassed 409 victories over his career, the most in NCAA Division 1 history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With Penn State wins restored, Joe Paterno the winningest coach again |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2015/01/16/ncaa-joe-paterno-wins-restored-penn-state-settlement/21867685/ |accessdate=November 27, 2015|publisher=USA Today|date=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterno died on January 22, 2012, at the age of 85.

The school's wrestling team has also become noticed. Under [[Cael Sanderson]], the Nittany Lions won six national titles in a seven-year span, from 2011 to 2017.

The university opened a new [[Penn State All-Sports Museum]] in February 2002. This two-level {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}} museum is located inside Beaver Stadium.&lt;ref name="sports museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=GoPSUsports.com – Official Home of Penn State Athletics |url=http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723052027/http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the school funded athletics, club sports also play a major role in the university, with over 68 club sport organizations meeting regularly to date. Many club teams compete nationally in their respective sports. The Penn State Ski Team, which competes as part of the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) in the Allegheny Conference, as well as the Penn State Swim Club, which competes in the American Swimming Association – University League (ASAU), are just a few examples. Some other clubs include baseball, [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[karate]], [[crew (sport)|crew]], and sailing.

Penn State's most well known athletic cheer is "We are...Penn State." Typically, the students and cheerleaders shout, "We are," followed by a response of "Penn State" from the rest of the fans. By tradition, this is done three times, and followed by "Thank you..." "... You're welcome!"

Since 2001, the university, along with all schools in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], has participated in the "Big Ten Challenge" website, which is a "competitive" clearinghouse of alumni donation statistics for member schools. Results are tracked to determine a percentage of each school's alumni from the previous decade who gave to their alma mater each calendar year (during the 2005–2006 year, alumni donations from 1996 to 2005 were tallied).

[[File:Phased array animation with arrow 10frames 371x400px 100ms.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Animation showing how a phased array works. It consists of an array of antenna elements ''(A)'' powered by a [[transmitter]] ''(TX)''.  The feed current for each antenna passes through a [[phase shifter]] ''(φ)'' controlled by a computer ''(C)''.  The moving red lines show the wavefronts of the radio waves emitted by each element.  The individual wavefronts are spherical, but they combine ([[Superposition principle|superpose]]) in front of the antenna to create a [[plane wave]], a beam of radio waves travelling in a specific direction.  The phase shifters delay the radio waves progressively going up the line so each antenna emits its wavefront later than the one below it.  This causes the resulting plane wave to be directed at an angle ''θ'' to the antenna's axis.  By changing the phase shifts the computer can instantly change the angle ''θ'' of the beam.  Most phased arrays have two-dimensional arrays of antennas instead of the linear array shown here, and the beam can be steered in two dimensions.  The velocity of the radio waves is shown slowed down enormously.]]

In [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] theory, a '''phased array''' usually means an '''electronically scanned array''', a computer-controlled [[Antenna array|array of antennas]] which creates a beam of radio waves that can be electronically steered to point in different directions without moving the antennas.&lt;ref name="Milligan"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an array antenna, the radio frequency current from the [[transmitter]] is fed to the individual antennas with the correct [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship so that the radio waves from the separate antennas add together to increase the radiation in a desired direction, while cancelling to suppress radiation in undesired directions.  In a phased array, the power from the transmitter is fed to the antennas through devices called ''[[phase shifter]]s'', controlled by a computer system, which can alter the phase electronically, thus steering the beam of radio waves to a different direction.  Since the array must consist of many small antennas (sometimes thousands) to achieve high gain, phased arrays are mainly practical at the high [[frequency]] end of the radio spectrum, in the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] and [[microwave]] bands, in which the antenna elements are conveniently small.

Phased arrays were invented for use in military [[radar]] systems, to scan the radar beam quickly across the sky to detect planes and missiles.  These '''phased array radar''' systems are now widely used, and phased arrays are spreading to civilian applications.  The phased array principle is also used in [[acoustics]], and phased arrays of [[transducer|acoustic transducers]] are used in medical [[ultrasound imaging]] scanners ([[phased array ultrasonics]]), [[hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas prospecting]] ([[reflection seismology]]), and military [[sonar]] systems.

The term is also used to a lesser extent for unsteered [[array antenna]]s in which the phase of the feed power and thus the radiation pattern of the antenna is fixed.&lt;ref name="Visser"&gt;{{cite book

== Types ==
A ''passive phased array'' or ''[[passive electronically scanned array]]'' (PESA) is a phased array in which the antenna elements are connected to a single [[transmitter]] and/or [[radio receiver|receiver]], as shown in the animation at top.  PESAs are the most common type of phased array. 

An ''active phased array'' or ''[[active electronically scanned array]]'' (AESA)  is a phased array in which each antenna element has its own transmitter/receiver unit, all controlled by the computer.  Active arrays are a more advanced, second-generation phased-array technology which are used in military applications; unlike PESAs they can radiate multiple beams of radio waves at multiple frequencies in different directions simultaneously.

A ''[[conformal antenna]]'' is a phased array in which the individual antennas, instead of being arranged in a flat plane, are mounted on a curved surface.  The phase shifters compensate for the different path lengths of the waves due to the antenna elements' varying position on the surface, allowing the array to radiate a plane wave.  Conformal antennas are used in aircraft and missiles, to integrate the antenna into the curving surface of the aircraft to reduce aerodynamic drag.

The relative [[amplitude]]s of—and constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects among—the signals radiated by the individual antennas determine the effective [[radiation pattern]] of the array. A phased array may be used to point a fixed radiation pattern, or to [[wikt:scan|scan]] rapidly in [[azimuth]] or elevation. Simultaneous electrical scanning in both azimuth and elevation was first demonstrated in a phased array antenna at [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], California in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph Spradley, "A Volumetric Electrically Scanned Two-Dimensional Microwave Antenna Array," IRE National Convention Record, Part I – Antennas and Propagation; Microwaves, New York: The Institute of Radio Engineers, 1958, 204–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Broadcasting ===
In [[broadcast engineering]], phased arrays are used by many [[AM broadcasting|AM broadcast]] [[radio stations]] to enhance [[signal strength]] and therefore coverage in the [[city of license]], while minimizing [[Interference (communication)|interference]] to other areas. Due to the differences between daytime and nighttime [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] [[radio propagation|propagation]] at [[mediumwave]] frequencies, it is common for AM broadcast stations to change between day ([[groundwave]]) and night ([[skywave]]) radiation patterns by switching the [[phase (waves)|phase]] and power levels supplied to the individual antenna elements ([[mast radiator]]s) daily at [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. For [[shortwave]] broadcasts many stations use arrays of horizontal dipoles. A common arrangement uses 16 dipoles in a 4×4 array. Usually this is in front of a wire grid reflector. The phasing is often switchable to allow [[Beam steering]] in azimuth and sometimes elevation.

More modest phased array longwire antenna systems may be employed by private radio enthusiasts to receive longwave, mediumwave (AM) and shortwave radio broadcasts from great distances.

On [[VHF]], phased arrays are used extensively for [[FM broadcasting]]. These greatly increase the [[antenna gain]], magnifying the emitted RF energy toward the [[horizon]], which in turn greatly increases a station's [[broadcast range]]. In these situations, the distance to each element from the transmitter is identical, or is one (or other [[integer]]) wavelength apart. Phasing the array such that the lower elements are slightly delayed (by making the distance to them longer) causes a downward [[beam tilt]], which is very useful if the antenna is quite high on a [[radio tower]].

Other phasing adjustments can increase the downward radiation in the [[far field]] without tilting the main [[Side lobe|lobe]], creating [[null fill]] to compensate for extremely high [[mountain]]top locations, or decrease it in the [[near and far field|near field]], to prevent excessive exposure to those workers or even nearby homeowners on the ground.  The latter effect is also achieved by half-wave spacing – inserting additional elements halfway between existing elements with full-wave spacing.  This phasing achieves roughly the same horizontal gain as the full-wave spacing; that is, a five-element full-wave-spaced array equals a nine- or ten-element half-wave-spaced array.

=== Radar ===
Phased array radar systems are also used by [[warships]] of many navies. Because of the rapidity with which the [[Beam steering|beam can be steered]], phased array radars allow a warship to use one [[radar]] system for surface detection and tracking (finding ships), air detection and tracking (finding aircraft and missiles) and missile uplink capabilities. Before using these systems, each [[surface-to-air missile]] in flight required a dedicated [[fire-control radar]], which meant that radar-guided weapons could only engage a small number of simultaneous targets. Phased array systems can be used to control missiles during the mid-course phase of the missile's flight. During the terminal portion of the flight, [[continuous-wave]] fire control directors provide the final guidance to the target. Because the radar beam is [[Beam steering|electronically steered]], phased array systems can direct radar beams fast enough to maintain a [[fire-control system|fire control quality]] track on many targets simultaneously while also controlling several in-flight missiles.

The [[AN/SPY-1]] phased array radar, part of the [[Aegis Combat System]] deployed on modern U.S. [[cruisers]] and [[destroyers]], "is able to perform search, track and missile guidance functions simultaneously with a capability of over 100 targets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AEGIS Weapon System MK-7 |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]] |date=2001-04-25 |url=http://www.janes.com/defence/naval_forces/news/misc/aegis010425.shtml |accessdate=10 August 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701055247/http://www.janes.com/defence/naval_forces/news/misc/aegis010425.shtml |archivedate=1 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Thales Herakles]] phased array multi-function radar used in service with [[France]], [[Russia]] and [[Singapore]] has a track capacity of 200 targets and is able to achieve automatic target detection, confirmation and track initiation in a single scan, while simultaneously providing mid-course guidance updates to the [[MBDA Aster]] missiles launched from the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Richard |date=April 2006 |title=Singapore Moves to Realise Its Formidable Ambitions|journal=Jane's Navy International |volume=111 |issue=4 |pages=42–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[German Navy]] and the [[Royal Dutch Navy]] have developed the [[Active Phased Array Radar]] System (APAR). The [[MIM-104 Patriot]] and other ground-based antiaircraft systems use phased array radar for similar benefits.

=== Weather research usage ===
[[File:Par installation.jpg|thumb|left|AN/SPY-1A radar installation at [[NSSL]], Norman, Oklahoma. The round dome primarily provides weather protection.]]
The [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] has been using a SPY-1A phased array antenna, provided by the US Navy, for weather research at its [[Norman, Oklahoma]] facility since April 23, 2003. It is hoped that research will lead to a better understanding of thunderstorms and tornadoes, eventually leading to increased warning times and enhanced prediction of tornadoes. Current project participants include the National Severe Storms Laboratory and National Weather Service Radar Operations Center, [[Lockheed Martin]], [[United States Navy]], [[University of Oklahoma]] School of Meteorology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and [[Atmospheric Radar Research Center]], Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], and Basic Commerce and Industries. The project includes [[research and development]], future [[technology transfer]] and potential deployment of the system throughout the United States.

==Mathematical perspective and formulas==

[[File:Phase array sweep.webm|thumb|Radiation pattern of phased array containing 7 emitters spaced a quarter wavelength apart, showing the beam switching direction.  The phase shift between adjacent emitters is switched from 45 degrees to −45 degrees]]

[[File:Phased array radiation pattern.gif|thumb|483x483px|The radiation pattern of a phased array in polar coordinate system.]]
Mathematically a phased array is an example of ''N''-slit [[diffraction]], in which the radiation field at the receiving point is the result of the coherent addition of ''N'' point sources in a line.  Since each individual antenna acts as a slit, emitting radio waves, their diffraction pattern can be calculated by adding the phase shift φ to the fringing term.

We will begin from the ''N''-slit diffraction pattern derived on the [[diffraction formalism]] page, with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; slits of equal size &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and spacing &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi = \psi_0\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta \right)}
         {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2}  kd \sin\theta \right)}
         {\sin\left(\frac{kd}{2}    \sin\theta \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, adding a φ term to the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;kd\sin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; fringe effect in the second term yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \psi = \psi_0\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
         {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}\,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2} \left(\frac{{2\pi d}}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi \right)\right)}
         {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the square of the wave function gives us the intensity of the wave.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  I &amp;= I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
                      {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}
           \right)^2
           \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{N}{2} \left(\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi\right)\right)}
                      {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda} \sin\theta + \phi \right)}
           \right)^2 \\
  I &amp;= I_0 \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\right)}
                                {\frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta}
           \right)^2
           \left(\frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi  }{\lambda} Nd \sin\theta + \frac{N}{2} \phi\right)}
                      {\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}    \sin\theta + \phi \right)}\right)^2  
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now space the emitters a distance &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d = \frac{\lambda}{4}&lt;/math&gt; apart.  This distance is chosen for simplicity of calculation but can be adjusted as any scalar fraction of the wavelength.

:&lt;math&gt;I = I_0{{\left(\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi a}{\lambda } \sin\theta \right)}{\frac{\pi a}{\lambda }
\sin\theta }\right)}^2}{{\left(\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi }{4} N \sin\theta+\frac{N}{2} \phi \right)}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi }{4}
\sin\theta+ \phi \right)}\right)}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

As sine achieves its maximum at &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we set the numerator of the second term = 1.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{\pi}{4}N\sin\theta + \frac{N}{2}\phi &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} \\
                                  \sin\theta &amp;= \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{N}{2}\phi \right)\frac{4}{N\pi} \\
                                  \sin\theta &amp;= \frac{2}{N} - \frac{2\phi}{\pi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus as ''N'' gets large, the term will be dominated by the &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{2\phi}{\pi}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; term.  As sine can oscillate between −1 and 1, we can see that setting &lt;math&gt;\phi=-\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{2}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; will send the maximum energy on an angle given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \sin^{-1} 1 = \frac{\pi}{2} = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, we can see that if we wish to adjust the angle at which the maximum energy is emitted, we need only to adjust the phase shift φ between successive antennas.  Indeed, the phase shift corresponds to the negative angle of maximum signal.

A similar calculation will show that the denominator is minimized by the same factor.

== Different types of phased arrays ==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
{{Main|Beamforming}}
There are two main types of beamformers. These are [[time domain]] beamformers and [[frequency domain]] beamformers.

A graduated attenuation window is sometimes applied across the face of the array to improve side-lobe suppression performance, in addition to the phase shift.

Time domain beamformer works by introducing time delays. The basic operation is called "delay and sum". It delays the incoming signal from each array element by a certain amount of time, and then adds them together. The most common kind of time domain beam former is serpentine waveguide. Active phased array designs use individual delay lines that are switched on and off. [[Yttrium iron garnet]] phase shifters vary the phase delay using the strength of a magnetic field.

There are two different types of frequency domain beamformers.

The first type separates the different frequency components that are present in the received signal into multiple frequency bins (using either a [[Discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) or a [[filterbank]]). When different delay and sum beamformers are applied to each frequency bin, the result is that the main lobe simultaneously points in multiple different directions at each of the different frequencies. This can be an advantage for communication links, and is used with the [[SPS-48]] radar.

The other type of frequency domain beamformer makes use of Spatial Frequency. Discrete samples are taken from each of the individual array elements. The samples are processed using a DFT. The DFT introduces multiple different discrete phase shifts during processing. The outputs of the DFT are individual channels that correspond with evenly spaced beams formed simultaneously. A 1-dimensional DFT produces a fan of different beams. A 2-dimensional DFT produces beams with a [[pineapple]] configuration.

These techniques are used to create two kinds of phased array.
:* Dynamic – an array of variable phase shifters are used to move the beam
:* Fixed – the beam position is stationary with respect to the array face and the whole antenna is moved

There are two further sub-categories that modify the kind of dynamic array or fixed array.
:* Active – amplifiers or processors are in each phase shifter element
:* Passive – large central amplifier with attenuating phase shifters

=== Dynamic phased array ===
Each array element incorporates an adjustable phase shifter that are collectively used to move the beam with respect to the array face.

Dynamic phased array require no physical movement to aim the beam. The beam is moved electronically. This can produce antenna motion fast enough to use a small pencil-beam to simultaneously track multiple targets while searching for new targets using just one radar set (track while search).

As an example, an antenna with a 2 degree beam with a pulse rate of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz will require approximately 8 seconds to cover an entire hemisphere consisting of 8,000 pointing positions. This configuration provides 12 opportunities to detect a {{convert|1000|m/s|mph km/h|abbr=on}} vehicle over a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which is suitable for military applications.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The position of mechanically steered antennas can be predicted, which can be used to create [[electronic countermeasures]] that interfere with radar operation. The flexibility resulting from phased array operation allows beams to be aimed at random locations, which eliminates this vulnerability. This is also desirable for military applications.

=== Fixed phased array ===
[[File:Antenna-tower-collinear-et-al.jpg|thumb|130px|An antenna tower consisting of a fixed phase collinear antenna array with four elements]]
Fixed phased array antennas are typically used to create an antenna with a more desirable form factor than the conventional [[parabolic reflector]] or [[cassegrain reflector]]. Fixed phased arrays incorporate fixed phase shifters. For example, most commercial FM Radio and TV antenna towers use a [[collinear antenna array]], which is a fixed phased array of dipole elements.

In radar applications, this kind of phased array is physically moved during the track and scan process. There are two configurations.
:* Multiple frequencies with a delay-line
:* Multiple adjacent beams

The [[SPS-48]] radar uses multiple transmit frequencies with a serpentine delay line along the left side of the array to produce vertical fan of stacked beams. Each frequency experiences a different phase shift as it propagates down the serpentine delay line, which forms different beams. A filter bank is used to split apart the individual receive beams. The antenna is mechanically rotated.

[[Semi-active radar homing]] uses [[monopulse radar]] that relies on a fixed phased array to produce multiple adjacent beams that measure angle errors. This form factor is suitable for [[gimbal]] mounting in missile seekers.

=== Active phased array ===
[[Active electronically scanned array|Active electronically-scanned array]]s (AESA) elements incorporate transmit amplification with [[phase shift]] in each [[Transceiver|antenna element]] (or group of elements). Each element also includes receive pre-amplification. The phase shifter setting is the same for transmit and receive.&lt;ref&gt;Active Electronically Steered Arrays – A Maturing Technology (ausairpower.net)&lt;/ref&gt;

Active phased array do not require phase reset after the end of the transmit pulse, which is compatible with [[Doppler radar]] and [[pulse-Doppler radar]].

=== Passive phased array ===
[[Passive phased array]]s typically use large amplifiers that produce all of the microwave transmit signal for the antenna. Phase shifters typically consist of waveguide elements controlled by magnetic field, voltage gradient, or equivalent technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5082&amp;context=etd_theses&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com|title=YIG-sphere-based phase shifter for X-band phased array applications|publisher=Scholarworks|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527212406/http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5082&amp;context=etd_theses&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com|archivedate=2014-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/phaseshifters_ferro.cfm|title=Ferroelectric Phase Shifters|publisher=Microwaves 101|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913014513/http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/phaseshifters_ferro.cfm|archivedate=2012-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase shift process used with passive phased arrays typically puts the receive beam and transmit beam into diagonally opposite quadrants. The sign of the phase shift must be inverted after the transmit pulse is finished and before the receive period begins to place the receive beam into the same location as the transmit beam. That requires a phase impulse that degrades sub-clutter visibility performance on Doppler radar and Pulse-Doppler radar. As an example, [[Yttrium iron garnet]] phase shifters must be changed after transmit pulse quench and before receiver processing starts to align transmit and receive beams. That impulse introduces FM noise that degrades clutter performance.

Passive phased array design is used in the AEGIS Combat System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a460426.pdf|title=Total Ownership Cost Reduction Case Study: AEGIS Radar Phase Shifters|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234942/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a460426.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Direction of arrival|direction-of-arrival]] estimation.

'''Pollen''' is a fine to coarse powdery substance comprising pollen grains which are male [[Gametophyte|microgametophytes]] of [[spermatophyta|seed plants]], which produce male [[gamete]]s (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of [[sporopollenin]] that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the [[stamen]]s to the [[gynoecium|pistil]] of flowering plants, or from the male [[Conifer cone|cone]] to the female cone of [[Pinophyta|coniferous plants]]. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it [[germinate]]s, producing a [[pollen tube]] that transfers the [[sperm]] to the [[ovule]] containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called [[palynology]] and is highly useful in [[paleoecology]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], and [[Forensic science|forensics]].

Pollen in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the [[Stamen|anther]] of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Pollination |volume=22 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case of self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Pollen itself is not the male gamete.&lt;ref name="facts_and_practice_for_a_level"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Johnstone | first1 = Adam | title = Biology: facts &amp; practice for A level| year =2001 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | isbn = 978-0-19-914766-3 | page = 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each pollen grain contains vegetative (non-reproductive) cells (only a single cell in most flowering plants but several in other seed plants) and a generative (reproductive) cell. In flowering plants the vegetative tube cell produces the [[pollen tube]], and the generative cell divides to form the two sperm cells.

=== Formation ===
Pollen is produced in the [[microsporangia]] in the male cone of a conifer or other [[gymnosperm]] or in the anthers of an [[Flowering plant|angiosperm]] [[flower]]. Pollen grains come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and surface markings characteristic of the species (see [[electron micrograph]], right). Pollen grains of [[pine]]s, [[fir]]s, and [[spruce]]s are winged. The smallest pollen grain, that of the [[forget-me-not]] (''Myosotis'' spp.),{{which|date=February 2017}} is around 6&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] (0.006&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter.{{citation  needed|date=February 2017}} Wind-borne pollen grains can be as large as about 90–100&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = 59743 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.211287498 | year = 2001 | title = Corn pollen deposition on milkweeds in and near cornfields | volume = 98 | issue = 21 | pages = 11919–24 | pmid = 11559840 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | last1 = Pleasants| first1 = J.

In angiosperms, during flower development the anther is composed of a mass of cells that appear undifferentiated, except for a partially differentiated dermis. As the flower develops, four groups of sporogenous cells form within the anther. The fertile sporogenous cells are surrounded by layers of sterile cells that grow into the wall of the pollen sac. Some of the cells grow into nutritive cells that supply nutrition for the microspores that form by meiotic division from the sporogenous cells.

In a process called '''microsporogenesis''', four haploid [[microspore]]s are produced from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or [[meiocyte]]), after [[meiotic division]]. After the formation of the four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed prior to [[cytokinesis]], whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the [[monocots]] is successive, but there are important exceptions.&lt;ref name=Furness2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furness|first1=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|authorlink2=Paula Rudall|title=Pollen and anther characters in monocot systematics|journal=Grana|date=January 2001|volume=40|issue=1–2|pages=17–25|doi=10.1080/00173130152591840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During microgametogenesis, the unicellular microspores undergo mitosis and develop into mature [[microgametophyte]]s containing the gametes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/twell/lab/pollenis/development Pollen Development — University of Leicester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In some flowering plants,{{which|date=February 2017}} [[germination]] of the pollen grain may begin even before it leaves the microsporangium, with the generative cell forming the two sperm cells.

=== Structure ===
Except in the case of some submerged aquatic plants, the mature pollen grain has a double wall. The vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered [[cellulose]] called the '''endospore''' or '''intine''', and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of [[sporopollenin]] called the '''exospore''' or '''exine'''. The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as '''spinulose''' (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as '''echinate'''. Various terms also describe the sculpturing such as '''reticulate''', a net like appearance consisting of elements (murus, muri) separated from each other by a lumen (plural lumina).

The pollen wall protects the sperm while the pollen grain is moving from the anther to the stigma; it protects the vital genetic material from drying out and solar radiation. The pollen grain surface is covered with waxes and proteins, which are held in place by structures called sculpture elements on the surface of the grain. The outer pollen wall, which prevents the pollen grain from shrinking and crushing the genetic material during desiccation, is composed of two layers. These two layers are the tectum and the foot layer, which is just above the intine. The tectum and foot layer are separated by a region called the columella, which is composed of strengthening rods. The outer wall is constructed with a resistant biopolymer called sporopollenin.

Pollen apertures are regions of the pollen wall that may involve exine thinning or a significant reduction in exine thickness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furness|first=Carol A.|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|date=2004-03-01|title=Pollen aperture evolution--a crucial factor for eudicot success?|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=9|issue=3|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2004.01.001|pmid=15003239|citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5084}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow shrinking and swelling of the grain caused by changes in moisture content. Elongated apertures or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: [[Sulcus (morphology)|sulcus]]). Apertures that are more circular are called pores. Colpi, sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/ppapertr.html|author=Davis, Owen |title=Aperture|work=geo.arizona.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollen may be referred to as '''inaperturate''' (apertures absent) or '''aperturate''' (apertures present).

The transfer of pollen grains to the female reproductive structure ('''''[[Carpel|pistil]]''''' in angiosperms) is called '''[[pollination]]'''. This transfer can be mediated by the wind, in which case the plant is described as '''[[Anemophily|anemophilous]]''' (literally wind-loving). Anemophilous plants typically produce great quantities of very lightweight pollen grains, sometimes with air-sacs. Non-flowering seed plants (e.g., pine trees) are characteristically anemophilous. Anemophilous flowering plants generally have inconspicuous flowers. '''[[Entomophily|Entomophilous]]''' (literally insect-loving) plants produce pollen that is relatively heavy, sticky and [[protein]]-rich, for dispersal by [[insect]] [[pollinator]]s attracted to their flowers. Many insects and some [[mite]]s are specialized to feed on pollen, and are called [[palynivore]]s.

In non-flowering seed plants, pollen germinates in the pollen chamber, located beneath the [[Ovule|micropyle]], underneath the integuments of the ovule. A [[pollen tube]] is produced, which grows into the [[nucellus]] to provide nutrients for the developing sperm cells. Sperm cells of [[Pinophyta]] and [[Gnetophyta]] are without [[flagella]], and are carried by the pollen tube, while those of [[Cycad]]ophyta and [[Ginkgophyta]] have many flagella.

When placed on the [[Carpel|stigma]] of a flowering plant, under favorable circumstances, a pollen grain puts forth a [[pollen tube]], which grows down the tissue of the style to the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]], and makes its way along the [[placenta]], guided by projections or hairs, to the micropyle of an [[ovule]]. The nucleus of the tube cell has meanwhile passed into the tube, as does also the generative nucleus, which divides (if it hasn't already) to form two sperm cells. The sperm cells are carried to their destination in the tip of the [[pollen tube]]. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise during [[pollen tube]] growth appear to be efficiently [[DNA repair|repaired]] in the generative cell that carries the male [[genome|genomic information]] to be passed on to the next plant generation.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirano T, Takagi K, Hoshino Y, Abe T |title=DNA damage response in male gametes of Cyrtanthus mackenii during pollen tube growth |journal=AoB Plants |volume=5 |issue= |pages=plt004 |year=2013 |pmid=23550213 |pmc=3583183 |doi=10.1093/aobpla/plt004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the vegetative cell that is responsible for tube elongation appears to lack this [[DNA repair]] capability.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213" /&gt;

==Pollen in the fossil record==
{{Main article|Palynology}}
Pollen's sporopollenin outer sheath affords it some resistance to the rigours of the fossilisation process that destroy weaker objects; it is also produced in huge quantities. There is an extensive fossil record of pollen grains, often disassociated from their parent plant. The discipline of palynology is devoted to the study of pollen, which can be used both for biostratigraphy and to gain information about the abundance and variety of plants alive — which can itself yield important information about paleoclimates. Also, pollen analysis has been widely used for reconstructing past changes in vegetation and their associated drivers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franco-Gaviria |first=Felipe et al. |title=The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |year=2018 |publisher=[[Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana 70, 1]] |pages=61–78 |url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Allergy to pollen==

}}
[[Allergic rhinitis|Nasal allergy]] to pollen is called [[pollinosis]], and allergy specifically to grass pollen is called [[hay fever]]. Generally, pollens that cause allergies are those of anemophilous plants (pollen is dispersed by air currents.) Such plants produce large quantities of lightweight pollen (because wind dispersal is random and the likelihood of one pollen grain landing on another flower is small), which can be carried for great distances and are easily inhaled, bringing it into contact with the sensitive nasal passages.

Pollen allergies are common in polar and temperate climate zones, where production of pollen is seasonal. In the tropics pollen production varies less by the season, and allergic reactions less.
In northern Europe, common pollens for allergies are those of [[birch]] and [[alder]], and in late summer [[Artemisia vulgaris|wormwood]] and different forms of [[hay]]. Grass pollen is also associated with [[Asthma|asthma exacerbations]] in some people, a phenomenon termed [[Thunderstorm asthma|thunderstorm asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erbas|first=B.|last2=Jazayeri|first2=M.|last3=Lambert|first3=K.

In the US, people often mistakenly blame the conspicuous [[goldenrod]] flower for allergies. Since this plant is entomophilous (its pollen is dispersed by animals), its heavy, sticky pollen does not become independently airborne. Most late summer and fall pollen allergies are probably caused by [[ragweed]], a widespread anemophilous plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oder|first1=Tom|title=Dear allergy sufferers: Don't blame goldenrod|url=http://www.mnn.com/health/allergies/stories/dear-allergy-sufferers-dont-blame-goldenrod|website=mnn.com|publisher=Mother Nature Network|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arizona]] was once regarded as a haven for people with pollen allergies, although several ragweed species grow in the desert. However, as suburbs grew and people began establishing [[irrigation|irrigated lawns and gardens]], more irritating species of ragweed gained a foothold and Arizona lost its claim of freedom from hay fever.

Anemophilous spring blooming plants such as [[oak]], [[birch]], [[hickory]], [[pecan]], and early summer [[grass]]es may also induce pollen allergies. Most cultivated plants with showy flowers are entomophilous and do not cause pollen allergies.

The number of people in the United States affected by hay fever is between 20 and 40 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skoner|first1=DP|title=Allergic rhinitis: definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, detection, and diagnosis.|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=July 2001|volume=108|issue=1 Suppl|pages=S2–8|pmid=11449200|doi=10.1067/mai.2001.115569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such allergy has proven to be the most frequent [[allergic response]] in the nation. There are certain evidential suggestions pointing out hay fever and similar allergies to be of [[Hereditary disease|hereditary origin]]. Individuals who suffer from [[eczema]] or are [[asthma]]tic tend to be more susceptible to developing long-term hay fever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/allergies/living-with-allergies-10/rhinitis Allergies and Hay Fever] WebMD. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], decades of rising temperatures cause pollen to appear earlier and in greater numbers, as well as introduction of new species such as ragweed.&lt;ref&gt;Siewertsen, Bjarne. "[http://www.dmi.dk/nyheder/arkiv/nyheder-2015/04/haard-nyser-for-allergikere-i-varm-fremtid/ Hård nyser for allergikere i varm fremtid]"  (English: Hard sneeze for allergic people in warm future) ''[[Danish Meteorological Institute]]'', 18 April 2015. Retrieved: 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most efficient way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first believe that they have a simple summer cold, but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear. The confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a [[General practitioner|general physician]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allergiesandtreatments.com/pollen-allergy/ Bee, grass pollen allergy symptoms]. allergiesandtreatments.com. Retrieved on 2010-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
{{main article|Allergic rhinitis#treatment}}
[[Antihistamines]] are effective at treating mild cases of pollinosis, this type of non-prescribed drugs includes [[loratadine]], [[cetirizine]] and [[chlorpheniramine]]. They do not prevent the discharge of [[histamine]], but it has been proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this [[biogenic amine]], which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.

[[Decongestants]] can be administered in different ways such as tablets and [[nasal spray]]s.

[[Allergen immunotherapy|Allergy immunotherapy]] (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to pollen, thereby inducing specific long-term tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Van Overtvelt L. et al. Immune mechanisms of allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy. Revue française d'allergologie et d'immunologie clinique. 2006; 46: 713–720.&lt;/ref&gt; Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Discovered by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911, allergy immunotherapy represents the only causative treatment for respiratory allergies.

==Nutrition==
Most major classes of [[predatory]] and [[parasitic]] [[arthropod]]s contain species that eat pollen, despite the common perception that [[bee]]s are the primary pollen-consuming arthropod group. Many other [[Hymenoptera]] other than bees consume pollen as adults, though only a small number feed on pollen as [[larva]]e (including some [[ant]] larvae). [[Spider]]s are normally considered [[carnivore]]s but pollen is an important source of food for several species, particularly for [[spider]]lings, which catch pollen on their [[spider web|webs]]. It is not clear how spiderlings manage to eat pollen however, since their mouths are not large enough to consume pollen grains.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some [[Acari|predatory mites]] also feed on pollen, with some species being able to subsist solely on pollen, such as ''[[Euseius tularensis]]'', which feeds on the pollen of dozens of plant species. Members of some beetle families such as [[Mordellidae]] and [[Melyridae]] feed almost exclusively on pollen as adults, while various lineages within larger families such as [[Curculionidae]], [[Chrysomelidae]], [[Cerambycidae]], and [[Scarabaeidae]] are pollen specialists even though most members of their families are not (e.g., only 36 of 40000 species of [[Carabidae|ground beetle]]s, which are typically predatory, have been shown to eat pollen—but this is thought to be a severe underestimate as the feeding habits are only known for 1000 species). Similarly, [[Ladybird]] beetles mainly eat insects, but many species also eat pollen, as either part or all of their diet. [[Hemiptera]] are mostly [[herbivore]]s or [[omnivore]]s but pollen feeding is known (and has only been well studied in the [[Anthocoridae]]). Many adult flies, especially [[Syrphidae]], feed on pollen, and three UK syrphid species feed strictly on pollen (syrphids, like all [[Fly|flies]], cannot eat pollen directly due to the structure of their mouthparts, but can consume pollen contents that are dissolved in a fluid).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| chapter = The Pollen Feeders| title = Relationships of Natural Enemies and Non-Prey Foods| volume = 7| pages = 87–11| year = 2009| isbn = 978-1-4020-9234-3| doi = 10.1007/978-1-4020-9235-0_6| last1 = Lundgren| first1 = Jonathan G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of fungus, including ''[[Fomes fomentarius]]'', are able to break down grains of pollen as a secondary nutrition source that is particularly high in nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fungal Strategies of Wood Decay in Trees|author= Schwarze, Francis W.

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has not found any harmful effects of bee pollen consumption, except from the usual allergies. However, FDA does not allow bee pollen marketers in the United States to make health claims about their produce, as no scientific basis for these has ever been proven. Furthermore, there are possible dangers not only from allergic reactions but also from contaminants such as pesticides and from fungi and bacteria growth related to poor storage procedures. A manufacturers's claim that pollen collecting helps the bee colonies is also controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AA158| archiveurl = http://ufdc.ufl.edu/IR00004421/00001| title = Producing Pollen | author = Sanford, Malcolm T. | publisher = University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences | accessdate=2007-08-30}}.

== Spiritual purposes ==
In some [[Native American religion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, pollen is used in [[prayer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and rituals to symbolize life and renewal by [[sanctifying]] objects, dancing grounds, trails, and [[sandpainting]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. It may also be sprinkled over heads or in mouths. Many [[Navajo]] people believe the body becomes [[holy]] when it travels over a trail sprinkled with pollen. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Native American Religions|last=Hirshfelder|first=Arlene|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=0816039496|location=|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "shoestring organization" with "offices mainly on [Joseph J. Mangano's] kitchen table"&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; was established to examine the relationships between low-level nuclear radiation and public health and question the [[Nuclear safety in the United States|safety of nuclear power]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

As of November 2010, Radiation and Public Health Project members have published 27 medical journal articles on health risks from radioactive exposures to nuclear reactors and weapons tests.  RPHP studies have claimed elevated rates of childhood, thyroid, and other cancers near reactors.

According to a 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the group's work has been controversial, and had little credibility with the scientific establishment.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Similarly the work of the Radiation and Public Health Project has been criticized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission:&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/tooth-fairy.html|title=Backgrounder on Radiation Protection and the "Tooth Fairy" Issue|publisher=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies do not support the RPHP's claims. NRC finds there is little or no credibility in the RHP's studies". In an April 2014 article in Popular Science, Sarah Epstein referred to the group's work as "[[junk science]]" and disputed the group's peer-reviewed publications as being insufficiently evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/what-can-we-do-about-junk-science-16674140|title=What Can We Do About Junk Science|date=2014-04-08|publisher=Popular Science|author=Sarah Epstein|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Baby teeth ==
A set of 85,000 teeth that had been collected by Dr. [[Louise Reiss]] and her colleagues as part of the [[Baby Tooth Survey]] were uncovered in 2001 and given to the Radiation and Public health Project. By tracking the individuals who had participated in the tooth-collection project, the RHPR published results in a 2010 issue of the ''International Journal of Health Service'' that claimed that those children who later died of cancer before the age of 50 had levels of [[strontium 90]] in their stored baby teeth that was twice the level of those who were still alive at 50.&lt;ref&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/science/10reiss.html "Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011. Accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Matthew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/health/14cancer.html "Study of Baby Teeth Sees Radiation Effects"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 13, 2010. Accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was criticized by Stephen Musolino, a health physicist and specialist in radiation protection at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], as it "confuses [[correlation]] with [[Causality|causation]]" and in their opinion the authors of the paper are "ice-cream [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/health/decades-later-baby-tooth-survey-legacy-lives-on/article_c5ad9492-fd75-5aed-897f-850fbdba24ee.html Decades later, Baby Tooth Survey legacy lives on By JEFFREY TOMICH  Aug 1, 2013. St.Louis Post-Dispatch]&lt;/ref&gt;

RPHP studied 5,000 [[baby teeth]], the results of which were published in 5 medical journal articles.  High and rising levels of [[strontium-90]] in baby teeth were found near reactors.

The [[National Cancer Institute]], [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and nuclear industry groups responded with statements that the study was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/safetyandsecurity/factsheet/scienceonradiationhealtheffectsdispelstoothfairyproject/|title=Peer-Reviewed Science on Radiation Health Effects Dispels ‘Tooth Fairy Project’|date=August 2010|publisher=[[Nuclear Energy Institute]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups stated that the study suffered from small sample sizes; no control populations; no other cancer risk factors considered; no environmental sampling and analysis; [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] of data to fit the conclusion; and an incorrect [[half-life]] used for strontium-90. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not changed its opinion that there is no excess cancer risk from living near nuclear facilities.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;

== Fukushima ==
After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]], Mangano and Sherman published several articles claiming detrimental health effects in America caused by fallout from Japan:

In a June 2011 article in [[CounterPunch]], they claimed a 35% increase in infant mortality on the West coast of the United States in the 10 weeks after the disaster, vs the 4 weeks prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/06/10/is-the-increase-in-baby-deaths-in-the-us-a-result-of-fukushima-fallout/print|title=Is the Increase in Baby Deaths in the US a Result of Fukushima Fallout?|website=CounterPunch.org|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Moyer of [[Scientific American]] stated that their claims are "critically flawed—if not deliberate mistruths", pointing out that this increase only appears [[Cherry picking|when choosing these specific time periods]], and there is no trend in the overall numbers for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/are-babies-dying-in-the-pacific-northwest-due-to-fukushima-a-look-at-the-numbers/|title=Are Babies Dying in the Pacific Northwest Due to Fukushima?

Only by explicitly excluding data from January and February were Sherman and Mangano able to froth up their specious statistical scaremongering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, they claimed that fallout from Fukushima resulted in 13,983 excess deaths in the United States in the 14 weeks following the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangano|first=Joseph J.|last2=Sherman|first2=Janette D.|date=2012-01-01|title=An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation?|journal=International Journal of Health Services: Planning, Administration, Evaluation|volume=42|issue=1|pages=47–64|issn=0020-7314|pmid=22403909|doi=10.2190/hs.42.1.f}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was criticized for including different numbers of cities in the "before" and "after" categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Körblein|first=Alfred|date=2012-01-01|title=Response to "An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation"?|journal=International Journal of Health Services: Planning, Administration, Evaluation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=553–555; discussion 561–570|issn=0020-7314|pmid=22993969|quote=The reason for the observed increase is that the data before and after Fukushima differ. ...

It assumes that the "excess" deaths after March 20 are a real signal, not just a statistical aberration, and that every one of them is due to Fukushima radiation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2013 article, published in the ''[[Open Journal of Pedriatrics]]'', they claimed a 16% increase in cases of [[congenital hypothyroidism]] (CH) in 5 US states in the 10 months following the disaster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12416">The '''Regional Center for Nuclear Studies''' in [[Kinshasa]] (CREN-K, {{lang-fr|Centre Régional d'Études Nucléaires de Kinshasa}}), prior to 1970 known as the Trico Center ({{lang-fr|Centre Trico}}), houses the TRICO I and TRICO II nuclear [[research reactor]]s. TRICO I was the first nuclear reactor on the African continent.

==History==
[[File:Congolese nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|Ceremony commemorating the activation of the first Congolese nuclear reactor with Lovanium University rector Luc Gillon, Governor-General of the Congo Hendrik Cornelis, and Minister of Colonies Maurice van Hemelrijck]]
In 1956, prior to the independence of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from [[Belgium]], Luc Gillon [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Lovanium University]] launched the idea of establishing a research reactor at the university.&lt;ref name=besenate&gt;{{cite web|title=Vraag: Kernreactor in Kinsjasa.|url=http://www.senate.be/www/webdriver?MItabObj=pdf&amp;MIcolObj=pdf&amp;MInamObj=pdfid&amp;MItypeObj=application/pdf&amp;MIvalObj=16780309|publisher=Belgian Senate|language=nl,fr|date=June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the government of [[Belgian Congo]], with the approval of the Belgian [[List of ministers of the Belgian Congo|minister of Congo and Ruanda-Urundi]] bought a TRIGA MARK I reactor from [[General Atomics]]. The Trico Center was constructed to house the reactor and opened in 1959. It was built on land belonging to the science and medical faculties of the Lovanium University (later [[University of Kinshasa]]).&lt;ref name=besenate/&gt;

Post independence, at the 1967 [[Organisation of African Unity]] summit in Kinshasa African heads of state decided to transform Trico Center into a regional study center. Despite OAU recommendations, the center has only been operated by Congolese.&lt;ref name=unikin&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre Régional d’Etudes Nucléaires de Kinshasa|url=http://www.unikin.cd/index.php?page=crn-k|publisher=UNIKIN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1970 onwards it is known as CREN-K, Regional Center for Nuclear studies ({{lang-fr|Centre Régional d'Études Nucléaires de Kinshasa}}). CREN-K purchased a new reactor, TRICO II, with a larger capacity.

In 1968 the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Belgium signed general agreements on continued technological and scientific cooperation. Five years later in 1973 a specific agreement on cooperation of peaceful nuclear research was signed between Belgium and then [[Zaire]]. The agreements after several extensions lasted until 1987.&lt;ref name=besenate/&gt; In practise it meant that [[SCK•CEN]] assisted CREN-K in the construction and yearly maintenance of TRICO II.&lt;ref name=IAEArr/&gt; The Institute for Radioactive Elements (IRE) in [[Fleurus]] Belgium assisted CREN-K in the production of medical isotopes. In return CREN-K agreed to also run research programs proposed by mutually recognized Belgian institutions.&lt;ref name=besenate/&gt;

The TRICO II reactor is subject to yearly [[IAEA]] inspections.&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite web|title=DR Congo’s lone nuclear reactor idle but safe: expert|url=http://en.starafrica.com/news/dr-congos-lone-nuclear-reactor-idle-but-155005.html|publisher=AFP|accessdate=27 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522071515/http://en.starafrica.com/news/dr-congos-lone-nuclear-reactor-idle-but-155005.html|archivedate=22 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988 IAEA started a project to deliver replacement parts and new [[nuclear fuel]]. Because the American company [[General Dynamics Corporation]], which had been contracted to deliver these parts, was unable to fulfil its obligations due to an embargo imposed on the [[Mobutu]] government.&lt;ref name=besenate/&gt; In exchange for spare parts and training seminars from the IAEA the Democratic Republic of the Congo participates in RAF and AFRA projects.&lt;ref name=unikin/&gt;

The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo stopped adequately funding the project in the late 1980s. In 1998 it was reported that despite the lack of funds dedicated personnel kept the reactor in good shape. By this time the IAEA cooperation still had trouble locating replacement parts. Because spent fuel was not being replaced the reactor was only capable of operating at reduced capacity.&lt;ref name=besenate/&gt;

In 2004 the reactor was shutdown for a scheduled stop and has been in a state of ''extended shutdown'' since.&lt;ref name=IAEArr&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Reactors in Africa|url=http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/NE/NEFW/Technical_Areas/RRS/documents/RR_in_Africa.pdf|publisher=IAEA|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010 there have been renewed campaigns to gather more support among the public opinion for CREN-K and utilizing the national resource that is uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=news photo video L’Adg du CREN-K/Unikin compte édifier l’opinion sur l’utilité de l’uranium de la République démocratique du Congo|url=http://www.digitalcongo.net/article/72173|publisher=digitalcongo.net|accessdate=27 December 2012|language=fr|date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The ''Commissariat Général à l’Energie Atomique'' (CGEA) is responsible for nuclear energy, CREN-K and its reactors. It was previously known as the ''Commissariat des Sciences Nucléaires''. It is a state-owned company under the supervision of the scientific research department of MESU, the Ministry of Higher Education ({{lang-fr|Ministère de L'Énseignement Superieur et Universitaire}}).&lt;ref name=unikin/&gt;&lt;ref name=law82&gt;{{cite journal|title=ORDONNANCE-LOI 82-040 du 5 novembre 1982 portant organisation de la recherche scientifique et technique|journal=Journal Officiel de la république du Zaire|date=11 May 1982|series=23ème Annee|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; As foreseen by law CGEA's [[articles of association]] describe three structures.&lt;ref name=law82/&gt; Namely a Board of directors, a management committee, and a committee of auditors. However currently only the management committee exists and it is identical to the management committee of CREN-K. The committee consists out of a [[Commissioner General]], director of science, [[CFO]] and a staff representative.&lt;ref name=unikin/&gt;

In 2010, CGEA/CREN-K employed 175 people.&lt;ref name=unikin/&gt; In June 2011 the Congolese government appointed Lukanda Mwamba Vincent as Commissioner General of CGEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ordonnance n° 11/045 du 11 mai 2011 portant nomination d’un Commissaire Général à l’Energie Atomique.|journal=Journal Official de la République Démocratique du Congo|date=6 January 2011|series=52e année|url=http://www.leganet.cd/Legislation/JO/2011/JO.01.06.2011.TII.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactors==
"TRICO" is a [[portmanteau]] of the names [[TRIGA]] − the type of reactor − and Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1952-2002 SCK•CEN|isbn=9076971056|url=http://www.sckcen.be/en/content/download/1259/27403/file/BrochureSCK50_UK.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TRICO I===
A 50&amp;nbsp;kW TRIGA MARK I reactor. Initial criticality June 6, 1959. The reactor was shut down June 29, 1970. It has been dismantled but not fully decommissioned.&lt;ref name=IAEArr/&gt;
The reactor was used for training, fundamental research and for the production of agricultural and [[medical isotopes]].

===TRICO II===
A 1 MW TRIGA MARK II reactor. Initial criticality March 24, 1972. The reactor has been in extended shutdown since 2004. The reactor was used for training, fundamental research, isotope production and [[Characterization|material characterization]]. TRICO II uses uranium fuel [[Highly enriched uranium|enriched]] to 20%. CGEA intends to restart the reactor in the future.&lt;ref name=IAEArr/&gt; However to do this replacement parts are needed among which a $3 million digital control bay.&lt;ref name=afp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.G.

==Security and safety==
[[Image:Kinshasa, érosion à la cité Mama Mobutu - 20090706.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Erosion in the city Mama Mobutu, [[Mont Ngafula]], near the University]]
International observers have long been concerned about the safety and security of the two nuclear reactors and the enriched uranium they contain.

In 1998, a wall in the Regional Center for Nuclear Studies collapsed when torrential rains undermined the building's foundation.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/congo/index.html | title =Congo Special Weapons | accessdate =December 15, 2010 | publisher =globalsecurity.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; International Atomic Energy Agency officials have voiced concerns that the ongoing issue with erosion could lead to an accident that might contaminate the city of Kinshasa's water supply. Further concerns about the site were raised when, in 1999, an object that might have been a missile, struck the building and caused light damage.&lt;ref name="missingkeys"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/23/congo.chrismcgreal | title =Missing keys, holes in fence and a single padlock: welcome to Congo's nuclear plant | accessdate =December 15, 2010 | publisher =The Guardian | location=London | first=Chris | last=McGreal | date=November 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program has also had an ongoing issue with the disappearance of nuclear material that could be used by terrorists or rogue states. Several rods of highly enriched uranium (HEU) have disappeared from the reactors since the late 1970s. In 1998, a sting operation led by the Italian police seized a rod of HEU that weighed 190&amp;nbsp;grams. It was built by [[General Atomics]] in the early 1970s and shipped to Zaire for use in the TRICO II reactor. The rod was in the possession of an Italian mafia group that was trying to sell it for $12.8 million, possibly to a Middle Eastern country.&lt;ref name="StingUnravels"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Fleishman | first = Jeffrey | title = Sting Unravels Stunning Mafia Plot | newspaper = Philadelphia Inquirer | location = Philadelphia | date = 12 January 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the research center's director Fortunat Lumu and an aide were arrested and questioned about the disappearance of a large quantity of nuclear material, which local media reported was as much as 100 bars of uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6430031.stm | title =Congo arrest over missing uranium | accessdate =December 16, 2010 | publisher =BBC News | date=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak (Africa)#Democratic Republic of the Congo|leaked diplomatic cables]] reported on the troublesome security and safety situation. Including [[manioc]] farming adjacent to a building storing nuclear waste.

In 2012, Vincent Lukanda (CGEA Commissar-General) declared that CREN-K was no longer threatened by erosion, and that the Congolese government was committed to protecting and modernizing the nuclear site, citing investments into a new perimeter fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selon le commissaire général du CREN-K|url=http://www.lobservateur.cd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6473:selon-le-commissaire-general-du-cren-k&amp;catid=47:nation&amp;Itemid=49|newspaper=lobservateur|date=February 28, 2012|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] expert team concluded that organisational and technical improvements were needed for the safety of the shutdown reactor "particularly considering the country's decision to bring the reactor back into operation".&lt;ref name=wnn-20180517&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-DR-Congo-research-reactor-requires-improvement-says-IAEA-17051801.html |title=DR Congo research reactor requires improvement, says IAEA |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=17 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The resource fragmentation hypothesis''' was first proposed by Janzen &amp; Pond (1975), and says that as [[species]] richness becomes large there is not a linear increase in the number of [[parasitoid]] species that can be supported.  The mechanism for this [[hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] relationship is suggested to be that each of the new host species are too rare to support the evolution of specialist parasitoids (Janzen &amp; Pond, 1975).  The resource fragmentation hypothesis is one of two hypotheses that seek to explain the distribution of the [[Ichneumonidae]].

'''Retroreflective sheeting''' is flexible [[Retroreflector|retroreflective]] material primarily used to increase the nighttime [[wikt:conspicuity|conspicuity]] of [[traffic sign]]s, [[high-visibility clothing]], and other items so they are safely and effectively visible in the light of an approaching driver's [[headlamp]]s. They are also used as a material to increase the scanning range of barcodes in factory settings. The sheeting consists of retroreflective glass beads, microprisms, or encapsulated lenses sealed onto a fabric or plastic substrate. Many different colors and degrees of reflection intensity are provided by numerous manufacturers for various applications. As with any retroreflector, sheeting glows brightly when there is a small angle between the observer's eye and the light source directed toward the sheeting, but appears nonreflective when viewed from other directions.

== Applications ==

Retroreflective sheeting is widely used in a variety of applications today, after early widespread use in road signage beginning in the 1960s.

=== For road signs ===
Retroreflective sheeting for road signs is categorized by construction and performance specified by technical standards such as [[ASTM]] D4956-11a.;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/D4956.htm ASTM Standard D4956-11a]&lt;/ref&gt; various types give differing levels of retroreflection, effective view angles, and lifespan.&lt;ref name=Moeursheeting&gt;[http://www.trafficsign.us/signsheet.html Retroreflective Sheetings Used for Sign Faces]&lt;/ref&gt; Sheeting has replaced [[button copy]] as the predominant type of retroreflector used in roadway signs.

There are several grades of retroreflective sheeting which include the three major grades—engineer grade, high intensity prismatic (HIP), and diamond grade.  Within these categories there are further delineations based on material used and visibility distance.  Diamond grade typically has the greatest distance for visibility of the three major categories.&lt;ref name="Traffic Safety Warehouse"&gt;[http://blog.trafficsafetywarehouse.com/sign-sheeting-info/ Retroreflective Sheeting for Safety Signs &amp; Equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For barcode labels ===
[[Barcodes]] can be printed onto retroflective sheeting to enable scanning up to 50 feet away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.midcomdata.com/reflective-labels/ Retroreflective Labels]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In motion pictures ===
The special effects technique of [[Front_projection_effect|Front Projection]] uses Scotchlite reflective screens to create false backgrounds for scenes shot in studios. Front projection was used in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' during the "Dawn of Man" sequence. Other films that have used front projection techniques include ''[[Silent Running]]'', ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'', and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. 

''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' episodes IV, V, and VI, used retroreflective sheeting for the [[lightsaber]] blades.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JTIMIDNIVg8C&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;f=false Special Effects: An Introduction to Movie Magic]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autonomous vehicle navigation ===
Reflective tape is used to provide an explicit way to do [[optical]] navigation of [[autonomous vehicles]].  For example, strips of retroreflective tape are used to provide [[navigation]] inputs to the prototype [[Hyperloop]] pod vehicles on the [[SpaceX Hypertube test track]].&lt;ref name=uw20160108&gt;{{cite web |url=https://badgerloop.com/documents/TubeSpecs.pdf |title=SpaceX Hyperloop Test-Track Specification |edition=4.0 |publisher=SpaceX |date=8 January 2016 |accessdate=2 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215070801/https://www.badgerloop.com/documents/TubeSpecs.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1474">'''Reverse sensitivity''' is a term from the [[New Zealand]] [[planning]] system.

It describes the impacts of newer uses on prior activities occurring in [[mixed-use]] areas. Some activities tend to have the effect of limiting the ability of established ones to continue. A key instance is the impact of new residential development on mixed use neighbourhoods as an area goes through a process of [[gentrification]]. Such prior uses might be entertainment, commercial or industrial uses. New residents tend to have expectations of a level of amenity comparable to suburban residential areas and will complain about noise from established uses. This has previously had the effect of imposing economic burdens or operational limitations on the prior uses that reduce their viability, forcing them to close down or move. The concept of reverse sensitivity suggests that a reversal of this approach is possible and that the burden of providing residential [[amenity]] in mixed-use environments should fall to the developers of new residential buildings in those areas. Planning schemes can regulate these issues via [[zoning]] ordinances.

The '''Santa Fe Institute (SFI)''' is an independent, nonprofit theoretical research institute located in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] ([[New Mexico]], [[United States]]) and dedicated to the multidisciplinary study of the fundamental principles of [[complex adaptive system]]s, including physical, computational, biological, and social systems. As of 2016, the Institute is ranked 20th among the world's "Top Science and Technology Think Tanks" and 23rd among the world's "Best Transdisciplinary Research Think Tanks" according to the ''Global Think Tank Report'' published annually by the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGann|first1=James G.|title=2016 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report|journal=TTCSP Global Go To Think Tank Index Reports|date=2017|volume=12|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute consists of a small number of resident faculty and postdoctoral researchers, a large group of external faculty whose primary appointments are at other institutions, and a number of visiting scholars. The Institute is advised by a group of eminent scholars, including several Nobel Prize–winning scientists. Although theoretical scientific research is the Institute's primary focus, it also runs several popular summer schools on complex systems, along with other educational and outreach programs aimed at students ranging from middle school up through graduate school.

The Institute's annual funding comes from a combination of private donors, grant-making foundations, government science agencies, and companies affiliated with its business network. The 2014 budget was just over $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santafe.edu/about/governance/annual-report/ |title=2014 Annual Report |publisher=Santa Fe Institute |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary theorist [[David Krakauer (scientist)|David Krakauer]] became the Institute's president on August 1, 2015.

== History ==
The Santa Fe Institute was founded in 1984 by scientists [[George Cowan]], [[David Pines]], [[Stirling Colgate]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], [[Nick Metropolis]], [[Herbert L. Anderson|Herb Anderson]], [[Peter A. Carruthers]], and [[Richard Slansky]]. All but Pines and Gell-Mann were scientists with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. In conceiving of the Institute, the scientists sought a forum to conduct theoretical research outside the traditional disciplinary boundaries of academic departments and government agency science budgets.&lt;ref name=Waldrop&gt;{{cite book | author = Mitchell M. Waldrop | year = 1993 | title = Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | url =https://books.google.com/books/about/Complexity.html?id=JTRJxYK_tZsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite book | author = George A. Cowan | year = 2010 | title = Manhattan Project to the Santa Fe Institute: The Memoirs of George A. Cowan | publisher = University of New Mexico Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SFI's original mission was to disseminate the notion of a new [[interdisciplinary]] research area called [[complex adaptive system|complexity theory]] or simply [[complex system]]s. This new effort was intended to provide an alternative to the increasing specialization the founders observed in science by focusing on synthesis across disciplines.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of the Santa Fe Institute: Institutional and Individual Qualities of Expert Interdisciplinary Work |first=Dan |last=Dillon |url=http://thegoodproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/GoodWork22.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the idea of interdisciplinary science increased in popularity, a [[Complex systems#Research centers, conferences, and journals|number of independent institutes and departments]] emerged whose focus emphasized similar goals.&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowan /&gt;

The Santa Fe Institute was created to be a visiting institution, with no permanent or tenured positions, a small group of resident faculty and postdoctoral researchers, a large visitors program, and a larger group of external faculty affiliated with the Institute but located at other institutions. The motivation of this structure was to encourage active turnover in ideas and people, allowing the research to remain on the cutting edge of interdisciplinary science.&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt; Today, the Santa Fe Institute continues to follow this organizational model.

== Organization ==
The Institute is composed of several distinct groups. The resident faculty are researchers whose primary appointment is at the Institute. Along with the Omidyar Fellows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pathwaystoscience.org/programhub.asp?sort=PDC-SantaFeInstitute-OmidyarFellowship |title=Omidyar Postdoctoral Fellowship – Program Info |publisher=Pathways to Science |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of postdoctoral scholars in residence, the resident faculty makes up the majority of the researchers physically present at the Institute. The external faculty is a group of roughly 100 affiliated researchers whose primary appointments are at other institutions, typically universities. These individuals form a large and distributed community of scholars who frequently visit the Institute and contribute to its overall research program. The Institute's Business Network is a group of private companies and government agencies interested in complex systems research. Members of the business network often send representatives to Institute meetings or to serve as research fellows in residence at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Santa Fe Institute Business Network |url=http://www.santafe.edu/network/ |publisher=Santa Fe Institute |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Business Network Members |url=http://www.santafe.edu/network/members/ |publisher=Santa Fe Institute |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's Science Board is a large group of eminent scholars who advise the Institute on important strategic matters. This group includes a number of Nobel Prize winners.&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt;

The Institute is headed by a president, currently evolutionary theorist David Krakauer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/new-sfi-president-sees-unique-opportunities-at-institute/article_80018249-4ae4-54fc-b9d4-0823a8e477a5.html |title=New SFI president sees new opportunities |publisher=Santa Fe New Mexican |accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Vice President for Science, currently network ecologist Jennifer Dunne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://events.stanford.edu/events/356/35663/ |title=The Morrison Institute Winter Colloquium presents Professor Jennifer Dunne of the Santa Fe Institute, "Structural and Dynamical Roles of Human Hunter-Gatherers in Northwest Pacific Marine Food Webs" |date=2013-01-17 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is governed by a Board of Trustees, which is chaired by [[Michael Mauboussin]] of [[Credit Suisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ladailypost.com/content/santa-fe-institute-elects-new-chair |title=Santa Fe Institute Elects New Chair |publisher=Los Alamos Daily Post |date=2012-11-24 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Research at the Institute focuses on systems commonly described as [[complex adaptive system]]s or simply [[complex system]]s. Recent research has included studies of [[evolutionary computation]], metabolic and ecological scaling laws, the fundamental properties of cities, the evolutionary diversification of viral strains, the interactions and conflicts of primate social groups, the history of languages, the structure and dynamics of species interactions including food webs, the dynamics of financial markets, and the emergence of hierarchy and cooperation in the human species, and biological and technological innovation.&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt;

Historically, researchers affiliated with the Institute played roles to varying degrees in the development and use of methods for studying [[complex system]]s, including [[agent-based model]]ing, [[network theory]], [[computational immunology]], the [[physics of financial markets]], [[genetic algorithm]]s, the physics of computation, and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;

The Institute also studies foundational topics in the physics and mathematics of complex systems, using tools from related disciplines such as [[information theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[computational complexity theory]] and [[condensed matter physics]]. Recent research in this area has included studies of phase transitions in [[NP-hard]] problems.

Some of the Institute's accomplishments include:
* Complexity research which led to efforts to create [[artificial life]] modeling real organisms and ecosystems in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=Waldrop /&gt;

== Educational programs ==
The Santa Fe Institute runs a number of education programs aimed at introducing students as young as middle school and as old as graduate school to the core ideas of complex systems. The longest running education program is the annual Complex Systems Summer School, held annually for 30 years in Santa Fe at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]]. The CSSS hosts 50-60 graduate students and early postdocs, along with select Business Network fellows, for four week course on complex systems. Lectures are provided by Institute researchers, and students work on a small collaborative project on complex systems.&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt;

The Institute also awards an annual High School Prize for Scientific Excellence to a local high school student and a local teacher.

The educational programs include:
* Complex Systems Summer School (graduate and postdoctoral level)&lt;ref name=Dillon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complex Systems Summer School|url=http://www.santafe.edu/education/schools/complex-systems-summer-schools/|publisher=Santa Fe Institute|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cleanup reorganize|date=March 2014}}
In [[music]], '''sharp''', '''dièse''' (from [[French language|French]]), or '''diesis''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]){{efn|For the etymology of the words diese and diesis, see [[Diesis]].}} means higher in pitch. More specifically, in [[musical notation]], sharp means "higher in [[pitch (music)|pitch]] by one [[semitone]] (half step)". Sharp is the opposite of [[Flat (music)|flat]], which is a lowering of pitch.

There is an associated sharp symbol which resembles "#", {{Music|sharp}}, which may be found in [[key signature]]s or as an [[accidental (music)|accidental]]. For instance, the music below has a key signature with three sharps (indicating either [[A major]] or [[F-sharp minor|F{{Music|sharp}} minor]], the [[Relative key|relative minor]]) and the note, [[A♯ (musical note)|A{{Music|sharp}}]], has a sharp accidental.

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key a \major \time 4/4 \hide Staff.TimeSignature ais1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
Moreover, under [[twelve-tone equal temperament]], B{{music|#}}, for instance, sounds the same as, or is [[enharmonically equivalent]] to, C [[natural sign|natural]] (C{{music|natural}}), and E{{music|#}} is enharmonically equivalent to F{{music|natural}}. In other [[Musical tuning#Tuning systems|tuning system]]s, such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist. To allow extended [[just intonation]], composer [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] uses a sharp to indicate a note is raised 70.6 [[cent (music)|cent]]s (ratio 25:24), or a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Fonville]]. "Ben Johnston's Extended Just Intonation – A Guide for Interpreters", p.109, ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 29, No. 2 (Summer, 1991), pp. 106-137. "...the [[just chromatic semitone|25/24 ratio]] is the sharp ({{music|#}}) ratio...this raises a note approximately 70.6 cents."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], sharp can also mean "slightly higher in pitch" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the higher-pitched one (assuming the lower one is properly pitched) is "sharp" with respect to the other. Furthermore, the verb ''sharpen'' means to raise the pitch of a note, typically by a [[Comma (music)|small musical interval]].

==Variants==
'''Double sharps''' are indicated by the symbol {{Music|x}} and raise a note by two [[semitone]]s, or one [[Major second|whole tone]]. They should not be confused with a [[ghost note]].

:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4 \hide Staff.TimeSignature bisis1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
Less often (in for instance [[microtonal music]] [[Accidental (music)#Microtonal notation|notation]]) a score indicates other types of sharps. A '''half sharp''' raises a note by a [[quarter tone]] = 50 [[cent (music)|cents]] ({{audio|Quarter tone on C.mid|Play}}), and may be marked with various symbols including {{music|t}}. A '''sharp-and-a-half''' (or '''three-quarter-tone sharp''') raises a note by three quarter tones = 150 cents ({{audio|Neutral second on C.mid|Play}}) and may be denoted {{music|#t}}.

:'''&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4 \hide Staff.TimeSignature dih1 eisih
} }

&lt;/score&gt;'''

Although very uncommon, a '''triple sharp''' ({{Music|#x}}) can sometimes be found. It raises a note by three semitones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayrton|first=William|year=1827|publisher=Samuel Leigh|ISBN=1276309457|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88IJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22double+sharp+major%22+scale#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|volume=V|page=47|title=The Harmonicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/CMNExtremes.htm|title=Extremes of Conventional Music Notation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correctly drawing and printing the sharp sign==
&lt;!--This section should have info about distinguishing the double sharp from the letter x. Please discuss this HTML comment on the talk page if there are any objections.--&gt;
The sharp symbol ({{music|sharp}}) resembles the [[number sign|number (hash or pound) sign]] (#). Both signs have two sets of parallel double-lines. However, a correctly drawn sharp sign has two slanted parallel lines that rise from left to right, to avoid obscuring the staff lines. The number sign, in contrast, has two completely horizontal strokes in this place. In addition, while the sharp also always has two perfectly vertical lines, the number sign (#) may or may not contain perfectly vertical lines (according to typeface and writing style).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Order of sharps==
{{Main|Circle of fifths}}
The order of sharps in [[key signature]] [[Modern musical symbols|notation]] is F{{music|sharp}}, C{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|sharp}}, A{{music|sharp}}, E{{music|sharp}}, B{{music|sharp}}, each extra sharp being added successively in the following sequence of major keys: C→G→D→A→E→B→F{{music|sharp}}→C{{music|sharp}}. (These are sometimes learned using an [[acrostic]] phrase as a [[mnemonic]], for example '''F'''ather '''C'''harles '''G'''oes '''D'''own '''A'''nd '''E'''nds '''B'''attle or '''F'''ather '''C'''hristmas '''G'''ave '''D'''ad '''A'''n '''E'''lectric '''B'''lanket.) Similarly the order of flats is based on the same natural notes in reverse order: B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}}, A{{music|b}}, D{{music|b}}, G{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}}, F{{music|b}} ('''B'''attle '''E'''nds '''A'''nd '''D'''own '''G'''oes '''C'''harles's '''F'''ather or '''B'''lanket '''E'''xploded '''A'''nd '''D'''ad '''G'''ot '''C'''old Feet.), encountered in the following series of major keys: C→F→B{{music|b}}→E{{music|b}}→A{{music|b}}→D{{music|b}}→G{{music|b}}→C{{music|b}}.

In the above progression, key of C{{music|sharp}} major (with seven sharps) may be more conveniently written as the harmonically equivalent key D{{music|b}} major (with five flats), and likewise C{{music|b}} major (with seven flats) written as B major (with five sharps). Nonetheless, it is possible to extend the order of sharp keys yet further, through C{{music|sharp}}→G{{music|sharp}}→D{{music|sharp}}→A{{music|sharp}}→E{{music|sharp}}→B{{music|sharp}}→F{{music|x}}→C{{music|x}}, adding the double-sharped notes F{{music|x}}, C{{music|x}}, G{{music|x}}, D{{music|x}}, A{{music|x}}, E{{music|x}} and finally B{{music|x}}, and similarly for the flat keys, but with progressively decreasing convenience and usage.

The '''size-change termination principle (SCT)''' guarantees [[Termination analysis|termination]] for a [[Program (machine)|computer program]] by proving that infinite computations always trigger infinite descent in data values that are well-founded.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chin Soon|last2=Jones|first2=Neil D.|last3=Ben-Amram|first3=Amir M.|last4=Lee|first4=Chin Soon|last5=Jones|first5=Neil D.|last6=Ben-Amram|first6=Amir M.|date=2001-01-01|title=The size-change principle for program termination, The size-change principle for program termination|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=360204.360210|journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices|volume=36|issue=3|pages=81–92|doi=10.1145/360204.360210|issn=0362-1340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Size-change termination analysis utilizes this principle in order to solve the [[halting problem#Halting on all inputs|universal halting problem]] for a certain class of programs.

== Overview ==
The size-change termination principle was introduced by Chin Soon Lee, Neil D. Jones, and Amir M. Ben-Amram in 2001.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It relies on intermediary objects called ''size-change graphs'' that describe the relationship between source and destination parameters in a given function call (for a functional program). The method analyzes these graphs to make conclusions about the existence of [[Monotonic function|monotonically decreasing]] sequences of parameters throughout the execution of a program. The size-change termination principle is stated as such:&lt;blockquote&gt;If every infinite computation would give rise to an infinitely decreasing value sequence (according to the size-change graphs), then no infinite computation is possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Size-change graphs express both the ''possible'' presence of a function call as well as whether parameters within function call decrease or do not increase. In order to derive termination from size-change graphs, Lee at al. formulate a sufficient condition in terms of the graphs (with no reference to the underlying program). This condition is decidable by an algorithm that operates solely on the graphs.

Size-change termination analysis is related to [[abstract interpretation]], in particular to a technique called ''predicate abstraction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-15769-1_4|chapter = Size-Change Termination and Transition Invariants|title = Static Analysis| volume=6337| pages=22–50|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year = 2010|last1 = Heizmann|first1 = Matthias| last2=Jones| first2=Neil D.| last3=Podelski| first3=Andreas| isbn=978-3-642-15768-4| citeseerx=10.1.1.167.8500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to the halting problem ==
The [[halting problem]] for Turing-complete computational models states that the decision problem of whether a program will halt on a particular input, or on all inputs, is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]]. Therefore, a general algorithm for proving any program to halt does not exist. Size-change termination is decidable because it only asks whether termination is provable from given size-change graphs.

In [[landscape ecology]], '''spatial configuration''' describes the spatial pattern of patches in a [[landscape]]. Most traditional spatial configuration measurements take into account aspects of patches within the landscape, including patches' size, shape, density, [[Landscape connectivity|connectivity]] and [[fractal dimension]]. Other measurements are [[pixel]]-based, such as contagion and [[lacunarity]]. Together with [[spatial composition]], spatial configuration is a basic component of landscape heterogeneity indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gustafson, E.J. |title=Quantifying landscape spatial pattern: what is the state of the art? |journal=Ecosystems |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–156 |year=1998 |pmid= |doi= 10.1007/s100219900011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10411">[[Image:Staff240.svg|frame|alt=Musical staff|right|A typical five-line staff]]
In [[Western culture|Western]] [[musical notation]], the '''staff''' (US) or '''stave''' (UK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/stave|title=stave Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Usage and etymology|(plural for either: '''staves''')]] is a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch or, in the case of a [[percussion staff]], different percussion instruments. Appropriate music symbols, depending on the intended effect, are placed on the staff according to their corresponding pitch or function. Musical notes are placed by pitch, percussion notes are placed by instrument, and rests and other symbols are placed by convention.

The absolute pitch of each line of a non-percussive staff is indicated by the placement of a [[clef]] symbol at the appropriate vertical position on the left-hand side of the staff (possibly modified by [[transposing instrument|conventions for specific instruments]]). For example, the [[treble clef]], also known as the G clef, is placed on the second line (counting upwards), fixing that line as the pitch first G above '[[middle C]]'.

The lines and spaces are numbered from bottom to top; the bottom line is the ''first line'' and the top line is the ''fifth line''.

The musical staff is analogous to a mathematical [[Graph of a function|graph]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] with respect to [[duration (music)|time]]. Pitches of notes are given by their vertical position on the staff and notes are played from left to right. Unlike a graph, however, the number of [[Semitone|semitones]] represented by a vertical step from a line to an adjacent space depends on the key, and the exact timing of the beginning of each note is not directly proportional to its horizontal position; rather, exact timing is encoded by the musical symbol chosen for each note in addition to the [[tempo]].

A [[time signature]] to the right of the [[clef]] indicates the relationship between timing counts and note symbols, while [[bar (music)|bar lines]] group notes on the staff into [[Bar (music)|measures]].

==Usage and etymology==

''Staff'' is more common in [[American English]], ''stave'' in [[British English]]. The plural is ''staves'' in either case; ''stave'' is, in fact, a [[back-formation]] from ''staves''. &lt;ref&gt;Pam Peters, The Cambridge Guide to English Usage, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff positions==
[[Image:Staff lines and spaces SVG.svg|400px|right|thumb|Staff, with staff positions indicated.]]
The vertical position of the notehead on the staff indicates which note to play: higher-pitched notes are marked higher on the staff. The notehead can be placed with its center intersecting a line (''on a line'') or in between the lines touching the lines above and below (''in a space''). Notes outside the range of the staff are placed on or between [[ledger line]]s&amp;mdash;lines the width of the note they need to hold&amp;mdash;added above or below the staff.

Which staff positions represent which [[Note (music)|notes]] is determined by a [[clef]] placed at the beginning of the staff. The clef identifies a particular line as a specific note, and all other notes are determined relative to that line. For example, the [[treble clef]] puts the G above [[middle C]] on the second line. The [[Interval (music)|interval]] between adjacent staff positions is one [[steps and skips|step]] in the [[diatonic scale]]. Once fixed by a clef, the notes represented by the positions on the staff can be modified by the [[key signature]] or [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]] on individual notes. A clefless staff may be used to represent a set of [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] sounds; each line typically represents a different instrument.

==Ensemble staves==

[[Image:Brace (music).png|right|240px|Musical brace.]]
[[Image:Bracket (music).png|right|240px|Musical bracket.]]
A '''vertical line''' drawn to the left of multiple staves creates a '''system''', indicating that the music on all the staves is to be played simultaneously. A '''bracket''' is an additional vertical line joining staves to show groupings of instruments that function as a unit, such as the string section of an orchestra. A '''brace''' is used to join multiple staves that represent an instrument, such as a piano, organ, harp, or marimba.&lt;ref name="IrvinePauly1999"/&gt; Sometimes a second bracket is used to show instruments grouped in pairs, such as the first and second oboes or first and second violins in an orchestra.&lt;ref name="Rachmaninoff1965"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rachmaninoff|first=Sergei|title=Piano concertos nos. 1, 2, and 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIXcT_ooWpoC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=18 October 2011|year=1965|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-26350-2|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a brace is used for this purpose.&lt;ref name="IrvinePauly1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irvine|first1=Demar|last2=Pauly|first2=Reinhard G.|last3=Radice|first3=Mark A.|title=Irvine's writing about music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RrYmediD2QC&amp;pg=PA213|accessdate=18 October 2011|year=1999|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-57467-049-3|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strauss1904"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strauss|first=Richard|title=Eine Alpensinfonie ; and, Symphonia domestica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FE08SeSZnYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA71|accessdate=18 October 2011|year=1904|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-27725-7|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When more than one system appears on a page, often two parallel diagonal strokes are placed on the left side of the score to separate them.&lt;ref name="Grove System"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=System|author=Richard Rastall|access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four-part [[SATB]] vocal settings, especially in [[hymnal]]s, use a ''divisi'' notation on a two-staff system with [[soprano]] and [[alto]] voices sharing the upper staff and [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] voices on the lower staff.

Confusingly, the German ''System'' (often in the combined forms ''Liniensystem'' or ''Notensystem'') and Italian ''sistema'' refer to a single staff; ''Akkolade'' (German) and ''accollatura'' (Italian) designate systems in the English sense.&lt;ref name="Grove System" /&gt;

==Great stave / Grand staff ==
[[Image:Grand staff.svg|thumb|The grand staff]]
When music on two staves is joined by a [[Bracket#Curly brackets or braces .7B .7D|brace]], or is intended to be played at once by a single performer (usually a [[keyboard instrument]] or [[harp]]), a '''grand staff''' ([[American English]]) or '''great stave''' ([[British English]]) is created. Typically, the upper staff uses a [[treble clef]] and the lower staff has a [[bass clef]]. In this instance, [[middle C]] is centered between the two staves, and it can be written on the first [[ledger line]] below the upper staff or the first ledger line above the lower staff. Very rarely, a centered line with a small alto clef is written, and usually used to indicate that B, C, or D on the line can be played with either hand (ledger lines are not used from a center alto as this creates confusion). When playing the [[piano]] or harp, the upper staff is normally played with the right hand and the lower staff with the left hand. In music intended for [[organ (music)|organ]] with [[Pedal keyboard|pedalboard]], a grand staff normally comprises three staves, one for each hand on the manuals and one for the feet on the pedalboard.
[[Image:Piano staff.png|400px|thumb|none|A simple grand staff.  Each of the staves shown above has seven notes and one rest.]]

==History==
[[Image:Beneventan music manuscript example.jpg|400px|thumb|12th-century Beneventan manuscript showing diastematic neumes and a single-line staff]]

Early Western medieval notation was written with [[neume]]s, which did not specify exact pitches but only the shape of the melodies, i.e. indicating when the musical line went up or down; presumably these were intended as mnemonics for melodies which had been taught by rote.

During the 9th through 11th centuries a number of systems were developed to specify pitch more precisely, including '''diastematic neumes''' whose height on the page corresponded with their absolute pitch level (Longobardian and Beneventan manuscripts from Italy show this technique around AD 1000). '''Digraphic''' notation, using letter names similar to modern [[note (music)|note names]] in conjunction with the neumes, made a brief appearance in a few manuscripts, but a number of manuscripts used one or more horizontal lines to indicate particular pitches.

[[File:Byrd manuscript sample.jpg|thumb|right|Excerpt from a keyboard work by [[William Byrd]] written on a six-line staff, 1591]]The treatise [[Musica enchiriadis]] (AD 900) uses [[Daseian]] notation for indicating specific pitches, but the modern use of staff lines is attributed to [[Guido d'Arezzo]] (AD 990–1050), whose four-line staff is still used (though without the red and yellow coloring he recommended) in [[Liber usualis|Gregorian chant publications]] today. Five-line staves appeared in Italy in the 13th century and it was promoted by [[Ugolino da Forlì]]; staves with four, five, and six lines were used as late as 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Dictionary of Music (2nd edition, 1972): Neume, Staff&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Systems art''' is [[art]] influenced by [[cybernetics]], and [[systems theory]], that reflects on natural systems, social systems and social signs of the [[art world]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aat-ned.nl/wwwopac.exe?database=aat&amp;language=1&amp;TAB=&amp;%250=2583 Systems art], Dutch Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus, retrieved March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems art emerged as part of the first wave of the [[conceptual art]] movement extended in the 1960s and 1970s. Closely related and overlapping terms are ''[[Anti-form movement]]'', ''[[Cybernetic art]]'', ''Generative Systems'', ''[[Process art]]'', ''Systems aesthetic'', ''Systemic art'', ''Systemic painting'' and ''Systems sculptures''.

==Related fields of systems art==

=== Anti-form movement ===
By the early 1960s Minimalism had emerged as an abstract movement in art (with roots in [[geometric abstraction]] via [[Malevich]], [[the Bauhaus]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]) which rejected the idea of relational, and subjective painting, the complexity of [[Abstract expressionist]] surfaces, and the emotional [[zeitgeist]] and polemics present in the arena of [[Action painting]]. Minimalism argued that extreme simplicity could capture all of the sublime representation needed in art. The term '''Systematic art''' was coined by [[Lawrence Alloway]] in 1966 as a description of the method artists, such as [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]] and [[Frank Stella]],  were using for composing [[abstract painting]]s.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 694. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with painters such as [[Frank Stella]], minimalism in painting, as opposed to other areas, is a modernist movement. Depending on the context, minimalism might be construed as a precursor to the postmodern movement. Seen from the perspective of writers who sometimes classify it as a postmodern movement, early minimalism began and succeeded as a modernist movement to yield advanced works, but which partially abandoned this project when a few artists changed direction in favor of the anti-form movement.

In the late 1960s the term [[Postminimalism]] was coined by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]]&lt;ref&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, [[Art &amp; Auction|Art+Auction]], March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe minimalist derived art which had content and contextual overtones which minimalism rejected, and was applied to the work of [[Eva Hesse]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Richard Serra]] and new work by former minimalists [[Robert Smithson]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Sol LeWitt]], and Barry Le Va, and others. Minimalists like [[Donald Judd]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]] and others continued to produce their [[Late modernism|late modernist]] paintings and sculpture for the remainder of their careers.

=== Cybernetic art ===
[[File:Tsai opticalpainting.jpg|thumb|right|''Optical Painting'' by [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] (1964)]] 
Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cybernetic art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cybernetic art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1966–67), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In ''Beyond Modern Sculpture'' from 1968 Burnham builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1968, curator Jasia Reichardt organized the landmark exhibition, Cybernetic Serendipity, at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.

=== Generative systems ===
{{main|Generative art}}
[[File:Dombis 1687.jpg|thumb|Installation view of ''Irrational Geometrics'' 2008 by [[Pascal Dombis]]]]
Generative art is [[art]] that has been generated, composed, or constructed in an [[algorithmic art|algorithmic]] manner through the use of systems defined by [[computer]] [[software]] [[algorithms]], or similar [[mathematical]] or mechanical or [[random]]ised autonomous processes. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted to bridge the gap between elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"/&gt;

=== Process art ===
{{main|Process art}}
[[File:Bolognini-CIMs.JPG|thumb|right|[[Maurizio Bolognini]], ''Collective Intelligence Machines'' series (CIMs, from 2000). These are generative and interactive installations using the mobile phone network and participation technologies taken from e-democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Bolognini]], "De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital" / [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], in ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique'', Edition L'Harmattan. Paris, 2011, pp. 229-239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Process art is an [[artistic movement]] as well as a creative sentiment and world view where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'', is not the principal focus. The 'process' in process art refers to the process of the formation of art: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, and patterning.  Process art is concerned with the actual ''doing''; art as a [[rite]], [[ritual]], and [[performance]]. Process art often entails an inherent motivation, rationale, and [[intentionality]]. Therefore, art is viewed as a creative journey or process, rather than as a deliverable or end product.
In the artistic discourse the work of [[Jackson Pollock]] is hailed as an antecedent. Process art in its employment of [[serendipity]] has a marked correspondence with [[Dada]]. Change and transience are marked themes in the process art movement. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] states that Robert Morris in 1968 had a groundbreaking exhibition and essay defining the movement and the Museum Website states as "Process artists were involved in issues attendant to the body, random occurrences, improvisation, and the liberating qualities of nontraditional materials such as wax, felt, and latex. Using these, they created eccentric forms in erratic or irregular arrangements produced by actions such as cutting, hanging, and dropping, or organic processes such as growth, condensation, freezing, or decomposition".&lt;ref&gt;Source:  {{cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200906/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_Process_art.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} (accessed: Thursday, March 15, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systemic art ===
According to Chilvers (2004) "earlier in 1966 the British art critic [[Lawrence Alloway]] had coined the term "Systemic art", to describe a type of abstract art characterized by the use of very simple standardized forms, usually geometric in character, either in a single concentrated image or repeated in a system arranged according to a clearly visible principle of organization. He considered the chevron paintings of [[Kenneth Noland]] as examples of Systemic art, and considered this as a branch of [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Systemic art." The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004. eNotes.com. 2006. 19 Mar, 2008 [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/ systemic-art]&lt;/ref&gt;

John G. Harries considered a common ground in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as [[Serial art]], Systems Art, [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[Kinetic art]]. These kind of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and of the relationship between them.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"&gt;John G. Harries, "Personal Computers and Notated Visual Art", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 14, No. 4 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 299-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more flexible frame of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to the institutionalization of the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.&lt;ref name = "JGH 81"/&gt;

=== Systemic painting ===
Systemic Painting, according to Auping (1989) "was the title of an highly influential exhibition at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in 1966 assembled and introduction written by [[Lawrence Alloway]] as curator. The show contained numerous works that many critics today would consider part of the [[Minimal art]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Auping (1989), ''Abstraction, Geometry, Painting: Selected Geometric Abstract Painting'', Albright-Knox Art Gallery, page 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue Alloway noted, that ... "paintings, such as those in this exhibition are not, as has been often claimed, impersonal. The personal is not expunged by using a neat technique: anonymity is not a consequence of highly finishing a painting".&lt;ref name = "LA 66"&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "Systemic Painting", in: ''Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology'', by Gregory Battcock (1995). p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "systemic painting" later on has become the name for artists who employ systems make a number of aesthetic decisions before commencing 
to paint.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker (1973), ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945: Terms and Labels'', p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systems sculpture ===
According to Feldman (1987) "[[serial art]], serial painting, systems sculpture and [[ABC art]], were art styles of the 1960s and 1970s in which simple geometric configurations are repeated with little or no variation. Sequences becomes important as in mathematics and linguistic context. These works rely on simple arrangements of basic volumes and voids, mechanically produced surfaces, and algebraic permutations of form. The impact on the viewer, however, is anything but simple".&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Burke Feldman (1987), ''Composition (Art)'', H.N. Abrams, {{ISBN|0-13-940602-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Origins of Christianity Within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East''''' is a 1970 book about the [[linguistics]] of early [[Christianity]] and [[fertility cult]]s in the [[Ancient Near East]]. It was written by [[John Marco Allegro]] (1923–1988).&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Flint, Peter  |author2=VanderKam, James  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA324 |year= 2005 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-567-08468-2 |pages=324–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllegroIrvin2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allegro, John M.  |author2=Irvin, J.

==Theories==
The book relates the development of language to the development of myths, religions, and cultic practices in world cultures. Allegro argues, through etymology, that the roots of [[Christianity]], and many other religions, lay in [[fertility cult]]s, and that cult practices, such as ingesting [[entheogen|visionary plants]] to perceive the mind of God, persisted into the early [[Christian]] era, and to some unspecified extent into the 13th century with reoccurrences in the 18th century and mid-20th century, as he interprets the fresco of the [[Plaincourault Chapel]] to be an accurate depiction of the ritual ingestion of ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' as the [[Eucharist]]. Allegro argued that Jesus never existed as a historical figure and was a mythological creation of early [[Christian]]s under the influence of [[psychoactive]] mushroom extracts such as [[psilocybin]].&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"/&gt;

His claims have often been subject to ridicule and scorn due to Allegro's unconventional theory. As ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine put it in an article headed "Jesus as mushroom",&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909327,00.html "Religion: Jesus as Mushroom"], ''Time'', 8 June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To some biblical scholars in Britain, the new book looked like the psychedelic ravings of a hippie cultist. To others, it was merely an outlandish hoax. One described it as reading "like a Semitic philologist's erotic nightmare".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reaction==
The book has been described as ''"notorious"'' and as ''"one of the strangest books ever published on the subject of [[religion]] and [[pharmacology]]"''.&lt;ref name="Taylor2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Joan E. |title=The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWIMFY4VnI4C&amp;pg=PA305 |year= 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-955448-5 |pages=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[media frenzy]] when it was published at the dawn of the 1970s. This caused the publisher to apologize for issuing it and forced Allegro's resignation from his university position.&lt;ref name="FlintVanderKam2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Judith Anne |title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXHf8qdq9kYC&amp;pg=PA291 |year=2005 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |isbn=978-0-8028-2849-1 |pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Anne Brown suggested that the book was ''"difficult to read and difficult to summarize, because he follows clues that criss-cross different cultures and lead into many-layered webs of association"''.&lt;ref name="Brown2005"/&gt; Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the scrolls all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mark. "Foreword", in Allegro, John M. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls &amp; the Christian Myth''. Prometheus 1992, first published 1979, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Jenkins writes that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them, and calls the ''Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' "possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic".&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv6x5kTHGvsC&amp;pg=PA180 "Hidden Gospels"]. Oxford University Press, p. 180, {{ISBN|0195156315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconsideration==
Some studies of Allegro's work have given new purported evidence and led to calls for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael (2006) [http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm "Wasson and Allegro on the Tree of Knowledge as Amanita"]. ''Journal of Higher Criticism''.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' was reprinted in a 40th anniversary edition with 30-page addendum by Prof. [[Carl A. P. Ruck]] of [[Boston University]].&lt;ref&gt;Allegro, John M. (2009) ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'', 40th anniversary edition, Gnostic Media, {{ISBN|978-0-9825562-7-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A more articulate exposition of Allegro's insights into early Christianity and his discoveries studying the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] was published in his 1979 book ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth]]''.

The work of Allegro also gained recognition and consideration by such late proponents of experiential psychedelia through pharmacological interaction as [[Terence McKenna]], who cited Allegro's claims of certain psychoactive fungi analogizing the [[Eucharist]], spoken in a live lecture in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Brown2005"/&gt;

'''Theology Digest''' (1953–2010) summarized selected recent articles from over 400 [[List of theological journals|theological journals]]. Some were in the form of formal summaries, approved by the authors of the articles, while some were briefer abstracts for whose accuracy the editors assumed responsibility. 
 
The digest was published quarterly.  In each year, three issues contained the abstracts and summaries, and the fourth contained selected lectures from the series of [[Bellarmine Lectures]] and elsewhere. All issues contained a book survey as well, covering over 200 books per issue. 

The  Digest was founded by Cyril A. Vollert, S.J., and Gerald F. Van Ackeren, S.J.,  at the Jesuit divinity school, [[St. Mary's College, Kansas|St. Mary's College]] in Kansas in 1953, but those of other denominations became involved as well.  

Theology Digest was based at Saint Louis University from 1967 until 2010.

'''Wastewater discharge standards''' protect [[Water supply|water sources]] from [[Water pollution|pollution]] and mismanagement. Each country in [[Latin America]] has its own set of standards, and these vary according to types of water use, agricultural, industrial or recreational use. [[Water quality]] is maintained by controlling the [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] and [[bacteriology|bacteriological parameters]]. The majority of water laws include fines for noncompliance. In many cases fines are inadequate and do not stop offending. In some cases the standards are lax and monitoring inadequate.

In this paper is presented a summary of the majority of [[wastewater]] discharge standards in Latin America, complemented with a country ranking considering the quantity and severity of their regulations. Also, a comparative analysis of relevant standards is made, and a real case description for each country when the regulation was not accomplished.

==Chile==

In this country, the [[Ministry of Public Works (Chile)|Ministry of Publics Works]] developed the standard, the decrete number 609,&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Chilean Ministry of Public Works, NORMA DE EMISION PARA LA REGULACION DE CONTAMINANTES ASOCIADOS A LAS DESCARGAS DE RESIDUOS INDUSTRIALES LIQUIDOS A SISTEMAS DE ALCANTARILLADO,1998&lt;/ref&gt; approved on May 7, 1998. This norm was created with the aim to control the effluents discharged into the [[Sewerage|sewer system]]. This norm establishes the maximum discharge concentration in sewer systems and also the different parameters that will be monitored, depending on the economic activity developed by each industry. It also establishes the methods that must be used for taking samples of each parameter.
The control of the norm is responsibility of the company that provides the service of recollection of wastewater, being the regulator of sanitary services companies the main responsible. If a company produces disruption in the service, in terms of quality or quantity of the recollection, the companies of recollection of wastewater could suspend the service to that company.

'''Case description'''

In May 2009 Aguas Andinas, controlled by the Spanish Enterprise [[Grupo Agbar|Agbar]], will pay a fine because of a lawsuit presented against it by a group of neighbours because of the foul smells coming from the "La Farfana", a [[Water treatment|waste water treatment plant]]. This is one of the waste water recycling plants of Aguas Andinas. This bad odours caused [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive]] and [[Psychology|psychological]] problems. The organization announced that it will appeal this judgement, based on the argument that it was due to a couple of precise episodes beyond its control that did not cause any environmental or personal harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Ediciones Financieras S.A. |url=http://df.cl/portal2/content/df/ediciones/20090505/cont_111663.html |title=Aguas Andinas deberá pagar multa por US$4 millones a vecinos |publisher=Diario Financiero Online |date=May 5, 2009 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, the Sanitary Services Superintedent's Office (SISS) started a lawsuit against the paper company Licancel after “not complying with the 90 Supreme Decrete, that regulates waste water disposals”.
As the Superintedent's Office said, this decision is based on the investigation been forwarded that confirmed that this organization discharged its waste water without complying with the norm. As legislation establishes this office can propose and apply the corresponding sanctions, such as fines between one and a thousand Annual Tributary Units (UTA). This means  around 392 Million Pesos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20070613/pags/20070613213522.html |title=Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios comenzó proceso de sanción contra Celco |publisher=La Nación |date=June 14, 2007 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolivia==

The norm for discharge, is under the law 1333, approved on April 27, 1992. This law is the general law of environment, and for the specific case was created a regulation for water pollution.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;CONGRESO NACIONAL DE BOLIVIA, LEY N°1333 DEL MEDIO AMBIENTE,REGLAMENTACIÓN DE LA LEY N°1333 DEL MEDIO AMBIENTE REGLAMENTO EN MATERIA DE CONTAMINACIÓN HÍDRICA, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

This regulation is applied to every entity that produces a contamination on the water. In the case of the discharge over sewer systems the regulation is under the Chapter IV. It's stated that every company must agree with the company that provides the service of recollection of wastewater, the limits of discharge. The limits presented in this article, are those for new companies and for companies in process of identification of the type of body water that the company will discharge.

'''Case description'''

In August 2003, all the mining producers working in the city of [[Potosí]] must discharge their waste waters to a specific dike; otherwise they will be obliged to stop their operations. This statement, made by the director of Environment and Sustainable development, Limbert Paredes, who pointed out that this agreement was taken between the Mining Engineers Association of Potosí, law representatives and authorities of the Potosí County.
These companies installed in the upper side of the city must build a pipeline to discharge their waste water by the end of June 2003, which was not done. Because of this, a new meeting was held and a new deadline was given; August 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Edgar A. Amador |last=Pinto |url=http://www.ops.org.bo/servicios/?DB=B&amp;S11=4831&amp;SE=SN |title=Contaminacion de rios |publisher=Organizacion Panamericana de la Salud – Bolivia |date=August 3, 2004 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009. The neighbors of the “Mercado Walter Khon” have demand attention from local authorities because streets were flooded with waste water coming out from the sewers. Because of this social pressure, the city council made the maintenance and cleaning of the sewers close by the area where waters arose.
Besides some maintenance facts that helped in the flooding, the city council does not restore the S-2 pumping station. Therefore, the wastewater is not properly pumped into the treatment plant.
According to the city's responsible, Marcelo Vidal, because of the constant rain added to garbage and plastic bags, the sewer system is not working properly. Even though he pointed that the main problem's origin is in the pumping station, the situation has not been solved up to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Edgar A. Amador |last=Pinto |url=http://www.ops.org.bo/servicios/?DB=B&amp;S11=15302&amp;SE=SN |title=Aún no funcionan estaciones elevadoras y provocan reflujos de aguas servidas |publisher=Organizacion Panamericana de la Salud – Bolivia |date=February 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peru==

In [[Peru]], the norm has only few parameters with limits.&lt;ref name=PE1&gt;Superintendencia de Agua Potable de Lima, REGLAMENTO DE DESAGÜES INDUSTRIALES DECRETO LEY N° 28-60-SAPL,1960&lt;/ref&gt; These parameters are: temperature (35&amp;nbsp;°C), fats and oil (100&amp;nbsp;mg/lt), PH (5 – 8.5), BOD (1000&amp;nbsp;mg/lt) and settleable solids.&lt;ref name=PE1 /&gt; However a more comprehensive norm was developed by the ministry of housing, which now is under review and analysis of the [[Ministry of Environment (Peru)|environment ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivienda.gob.pe/ambiente/OMA1.html |title=Oficina del Medio Ambiente |publisher=Ministerio de Vivienda, Construcción y Saneamiento, Peru |date= |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present article, the values presented are the ones under approval.&lt;ref name=PE2&gt;Ministry of Housing, APRUEBAN LÍMITES MÁXIMOS PERMISIBLES(LMP) A LAS DESCARGAS DE AGUAS RESIDUALES EN LOS SISTEMAS DE RECOLECCIÓN DE ALCANTARILLADO SANITARIO&lt;/ref&gt; This new regulation was developed because of the damage that industrial wastewater is causing to the sewer system. For example, in year 2006 a study showed that 58% of the sample (24 companies) surpassed the limit of BOD5 established in the current norm.&lt;ref name=PE2 /&gt; In the same year other study showed that 57% of the sample (9 companies) surpassed the same norm.&lt;ref name=PE2 /&gt;

'''Case description'''

On 2010, water quality is one of the main problems of this country. Only 25% of the domestic water is treated, and the rest of it is thrown into rivers and lakes. This is why a series of measures have been addressed by government. In April 2010, the “National Authority of Water”  will implement different laboratories in order to determine the pollution degree of wastewater from industries. Penalties of up to 36 million Soles have been announced for companies that not treat their residual waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://radio.rpp.com.pe/cuidaelagua/habra-multas-para-empresas-que-no-trate-sus-aguas-residuales/ |title=Habrá multas para empresas que no trate sus aguas residuales &amp;#124; Cuida el agua |publisher=GrupoRPP |date=March 26, 2010 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==

In the case of this country, the parameters presented correspond to the [[Federal District (Brazil)|federal district]]. The regulation of the parameters is under the decree N°18.328 of June 8, 1997.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;DO LANÇAMENTO DE EFLUENTES LÍQUIDOS NA REDE COLETORA DE ESGOTOS – DEC 18.328 DE 18.06.97, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In the norm is established the maximum limit for industrial effluents in the federal district. Also it's stated the fines applied in the case the companies surpass the norm. Also the decree indicates the type of industry and the types of parameters, that each of them must control.

==Ecuador==

The norm that regulates the limits of discharge in [[Ecuador]], is under the general law of environmental management,&lt;ref name=EC&gt;Congreso Nacional, CODIFICACIÓN 2004-019, LEY DE GESTIÓN AMBIENTAL&lt;/ref&gt; and was created with the aim of regulate the discharge over sewer systems, criteria of water quality for several uses and the procedures for measuring the parameters on the water.&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio del Medio Ambiente de Ecuador, Libro VI de la Calidad Ambiental, NORMA DE CALIDAD AMBIENTAL Y DE DESCARGA DE EFLUENTES : RECURSO AGUA&lt;/ref&gt; Also the norm establishes that companies must keep a record of the generated effluents with the main operational data related to the effluents.&lt;ref name=EC /&gt;

'''Case description'''

In December 2009, the Environment Ministry fined on November 25, five companies of [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]] and [[Montecristi, Ecuador|Montecristi]] with US$43,600 after the failure to execute the environmental policy. These companies: SEAFMAN C.A., Treatment plant IROTOP S.A., LA FABRIL S.A., EUROFISH S.A., Y GONDI S.A. have to pay immediately. The results of laboratory samples proved that levels of different substances were over the limits that were established in the Environment Quality and Waste Water Regulations. An action plan has been implemented to avoid the surpass of the limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.codeso.com/PrensaEcuador/091201-El-Ciudadano-Ministerio-Ambiente-multa-industrias-contaminar.html |title=Ministerio del Ambiente multó a cinco industrias por contaminar |publisher=El Ciudadano Ecuador |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, in "Manglares" of "El Salvado", the fauna and flora which are extremely variate, are being affected by households and companies, because of loads coming from thermal power plants. Such discharges generate high temperatures (more than 35℃) that exceed the accepted and established limits, and in consequence the ecosystem is suffering irreversible damages.
Companies like "Categ" and "Electroguayas" have been forced to pay US$1000 fine, but this has not stopped this situation. Other company called "Interagua" has announced a new project that considers water treatment system for this area. The same is planned for Puerto Azul and the rest of the nearby cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planamanecer.com/portada/Actualidad%20%7C%20Noticias/content/modo/view/id/85/Itemid/7 |title=La reserva Manglares de El Salado está en peligro |publisher=Planamanecer.com |date=December 18, 2007 |first=Marialuz |last=Albuja |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentina==

The national law that regulates water resource in Argentina is the Decree 674 of 1989,&lt;ref name=AR&gt;National Decree 674 of 1989. Decreto reglamentario de la Ley 13.577 de Obras Sanitarias de la Nación. http://www2.medioambiente.gov.ar/mlegal/agua/dec674_89.htm&lt;/ref&gt; established by the National Executive Power and applies to the Federal Capital and all the parties of [[Buenos Aires Province]] that are subscribed to the National Sanitary Works Entity regime. The aim of the law is to protect national water resources in means of good water usage, water pollution and the good functioning of the National Sanitary Works Entity installations.
As well, it's applied the Resolution 79179 of 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Disposición 79179/90. Disposiciones instrumentales para la aplicación del Decreto Nº674/89.http://www2.medioambiente.gov.ar/mlegal/agua/disp79179_90.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the instrumental arrangements for the Decree 674 implementation. This Resolution includes wastewater discharging parameters to sewer system, water course and rainwater collectors, which are included in Annex A of it.

'''Case Description'''

In June 2006, in Argentina the concentration of different natural heavy materials, bacteries, nitrates and hydrocarbons exceed by much the figures considered dangerous. It is not by chance that rivers like the Paraná, [[Salado del Norte]], [[Salado del Sur River|Salado del Sur]], [[Carcarañá River|Carcarañá]], [[De La Plata River|de la Plata]] and [[Colorado River|Colorado]] are among the most polluted of the earth. Argentina does not have control means for [[wastewater treatment]] or disposal. There is information that relates about important and numerous water bodies being affected by wastewater disposal, with intense [[eutrophication]] processes due to the lack of treatment.

One out of four hospital beds is occupied by someone with a water related illness. In some inner areas of the country, like [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], water bodies are so polluted that the work in the water treatment plants has been affected. There are some projects to build treatment plants in the main locations, but discharges keeps growing.
Disposals from companies added to the domestic ones in the Riachuelo-Matanza sum up to 368,000 cubic meters per day, which is the double of the minimum average flow of the river. The mud in it has great concentrations of Chrome, Copper, Mercury, Zinc, and Lead. In addition, the highest concentrations of Lead and Chrome are located in the border between the councils of [[Avellaneda]] and [[Lanús]], in the Buenos Aires province.
The given treatments are not sufficient by any means, moreover, the treatments done by companies to their waste water are between deficient and non existing. Most of the water consumed by population comes from the same water bodies in which waste and domestic water is dumped, and because of the lack of treatment these populations ends up drinking water of doubtful quality or at a high purification cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecoportal.net/content/view/full/69816 |title=Contaminación, Arsénico y posibles soluciones... |language=Spanish |publisher=EcoPortal |date=June 8, 2007 |first=Cristian |last=Frers |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, a report generated by the Nation's General Audit (AGN) states that the plants that produce water drinkable are also polluting with elements contained in their waste water, which are over the national and provincial legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=806648 |title=Contaminan el río las plantas que potabilizan agua |publisher=La Nacion |date=May 17, 2006 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==

Mexican Law of National Waters regulates water exploitation, use, distribution, control, and the preservation of water quantity and quality.&lt;ref&gt;CONGRESO DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS. 1992. Ley de Aguas Nacionales.http://www.cddhcu.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To manage the wastewater disposal and control water sources quality, it was created in 1996 by the Environmental, Natural Resources and Fishing Secretarial, the official norm NOM-002-ECOL that establishes the maximum permissible limits of pollutants in wastewater discharges in urban sewer system.  The norm specifies the permissible concentrations of pollutants per day, per month and instantaneous sampling, which are included in Chapter 4 of this norm.&lt;ref name=MX&gt;Secretaría de Medio Ambiente, Recursos Naturales y Pesca. 1996.Norma official mexicana NOM-002-ECOL-1996. http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/gacetas/216/cca31.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Case Description'''

In January 2010, members of the Ducks Unlimited Association of Mexico warned of the death of more than 5,000 migratory birds. The specialist from the association assured that the main cause of this episode was the non treated waste waters from industries. He pointed out the real problem of pollution existing in the "De Silva" dam, and in some others dams in the state. He demanded intervention of the National Water Commission (Conagua) and from SEMARNAR, in order to regulate the discharge of waste water that ends up in the Turbio river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionero.org/ecologia/mueren-mas-de-cinco-mil-aves-en-presa-de-silva/?searchterm=None |title=Mueren más de 5 mil aves en presa De Silva |language=Spanish |publisher=Bionero |date=January 12, 2010 |author=Gaby Bárcenas; Martín Diego |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Municipal Commission of Water and Sewer System of Altamira (COMAPA) was fined by the National Water Commission, between 40 and 50 thousand pesos, for not having a water treatment plant as stated by law for all municipalities of the state of Tataulipas. The next stage would be built a pumping station in "La Pedrera" and the facility must be finished this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laprensa.mx/notas.asp?id=10865 |title=Comisión Nacional del Agua multa a COMAPA por no tener una planta tratadora de aguas |publisher=La Prensa |date=April 23, 2010 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==

The main regulator norm for water management is the Decree 1594 of 1984,&lt;ref name=CO&gt;Decree 1594 of 1984.Water usages and wastewater disposal.http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=18617&lt;/ref&gt; which normalizes water usages and wastewater disposal through all the national territory.  The decree establishes water quality standards, which are guides to be used as a basis for decision making in assignation of water uses and determination of water characteristics for each application. Water discharging parameters to public sewage are described in Chapter VI of this decree.
Also, it was considered the Resolution 3957 of 2009&lt;ref name=CO2&gt;Environmental District Department. Resolution 3957 of 2009.Technical norm, for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district.http://www.secretariadeambiente.gov.co/sda/libreria/pdf/Resolucion_3957.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to enlarge the water parameters comparison in this country. This resolution establishes the technical norm, for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district.

'''Case Description'''

A report published by the [[National University of Colombia|National University]] confirms the presence of Lead, Cadmium, Mercury and Arsenic in plants watered with the polluted water of the [[Bogotá River|Bogotá river]]. According to it, vegetables have high levels of heavy metals that can be dangerous for human health.
For the Regional Autonomous Corporation (CAR) this is due to industrial downloads. In general, levels found in water, soil and vegetables of this area are much higher than the limits allowed by the [[World Health Organization]]. The authors, Soacha y Mosquera show figures much higher than the European Union limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/cundinamarca/hortalizas-regadas-con-aguas-del-rio-bogota-contienen-metales-perjudiciales-para-la-salud_6309887-1 |title=Hortalizas regadas con aguas del río Bogotá contienen metales perjudiciales para la salud |publisher=El Tiempo |date= |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the industrial firm "Coca-Cola Femsa" was fined with 111,000 US$ due to its illegal discharge of industrial water in Bogotá, as informed by the District Environmental of the Capital District of Columbia. A technical report conducted by the Aqueduct and Sewer system of Bogotá proved the existence of some waste water disposal that does not go through the company's treatment plant.

The former Administrative Environmental Department (Dama) has given to the company an allowance for having a downloading point in October 2006, but the Aqueduct and Sewer system of [[Bogotá]] found that place has already four discharge points, none of them registered or authorized.  Since January 2008, those four points were closed down and conducted to a treatment plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vtv.gov.ve/noticias-ciencia-y-salud/11164 |title=Colombia: Coca Cola deberá pagar multa millonaria por contaminación |publisher=Venezolana de Televisión |date=August 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venezuela==

The Environmental Organic Law of [[Venezuela]] gives the guidelines in terms of water management, as a duty of the state for the protection of watersheds. This in terms of classification and control of the quality of water bodies, control of effluent discharges or fluids susceptible of degrading the aquatic environment and alters the levels of quality required to preserve and improve the environment. The Decree 883 follows these guidelines, being Venezuela's national norm for water classification and control, created in 1995.

The Decree regulates the quality of water bodies and wastewater discharges. This law establishes the different types of water and the permissible parameters for water discharges in accordance to the final water use.  Wastewater discharging parameters to public sewer system are contained in section V of Decree 883.&lt;ref name=VE&gt;Decreto No. 883  de 1995. Normas para la clasificación y el control de la calidad de los cuerpos de agua y vertidos o efluentes líquidos. http://ws-01.ula.ve/ingenieria/jmayorga/agua.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paraguay==

[[Congress of Paraguay]] emitted the Law 1614 of 2000 as the general regulatory and tariff framework for drinking water and sanitary sewer supply.&lt;ref&gt;Ley N° 1.614/2000. LEY GENERAL DEL MARCO REGULATORIO Y TARIFARIO DEL SERVICIO DE AGUA POTABLE Y ALCANTARILLADO SANITARIO.

This regulation includes in its Title VI, all what refers to quality of the performance of sanitary sewer supply. In Annex 10 are shown the maximum limits for physicochemical parameters, specifying discharge values for the type of wastewater treatment applied.&lt;ref name=PA&gt;Reglamento de Calidad en la Prestación del Servicio Permisionarios.http://www.erssan.gov.py/marcolegal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison Analysis==
For purposes of having an idea of the requirements of the regulation, an index was created with the aim to rank the countries. This concept assumes that if a country has tighten limits than other, or if it declares explicitly a limit, then the regulation could be considered more stringent.

This index takes in account all the parameters listed in the table, assuming the following criteria. If a country doesn't have any regulation, then it will get 1, from a scale of 10. If the country has the minimum limit it will get 10 points, if it has the maximum then it will get 5 points. Later, an average is taken from all the parameters of the country, giving the index a relative position of all the countries. Afterwards, all the values are classified using quartiles.
A summary with the values of each country is presented below.

===pH===
The pH is a chemical parameter that measures the acidity or basicity of the water and is commonly measured in situ. Distilled water has a pH of 7,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water-research.net/ph]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where less than 7 is considered acid and greater than 7 is considered basic. In most cases, low pH is due to organic overloading and low oxygen conditions in the water. This characteristic is strictly controlled because it has a direct effect on water ecosystems and sewer systems materials.

Usually, pH standard is between 6 and 9 and can vary easily depending on the discharge content.   In this case, Peru was the country with the smallest range (6–8) and Argentina and Mexico were the ones with the widest range (5.5–10). No limit was found for Canada Regulation.

===Settleable Solids===
A low concentration of suspended solids in water or even complete removal after treatment is crucial to maintain water ecosystems development. High concentrations of suspended solids can slow down photosynthesis, reduce dissolved oxygen and increase water temperature.

That is why suspended solids is a relevant parameter in wastewater discharge, that can be attribute to both industrial and domestic wastewater. When comparing wastewater regulations, was found that Bolivia has the strictest limit for this parameter (60&amp;nbsp;mg/L) while Colombia presented the highest limit (600&amp;nbsp;mg/L). The value presented for Colombia was extracted from the technical norm for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district. Within these two limit values is shown a big difference among the two countries regulations for these standard, whereas for Canada was encountered an average value of 350&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;===
The BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; standard is also an indicator of solid's presence in water, but specifically for organic matter. BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;represents the amount of oxygen required by microorganism to stabilize organic material present in wastewater. A higher concentration of BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; means a high load of organic matter to be stabilized by microorganism.

Therefore, Chile has the stricter regulation for BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; permitting wastewater discharges with a value between 33 and 55&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Also, Chile was the only country that presented a range for the limit of this parameter. By the other hand, Colombia has the higher limit with 800&amp;nbsp;mg/L. In this case, is also taken the value from the Capital District Regulation, because there wasn’t a specific value presented in the national norm, just said that BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; removal must be greater than 80% for a new user. In comparison with Canada and the other countries, Chile's limit is a very strict value.

===Arsenic===
Arsenic is considered as a substance of sanitary interest and at the same time is one of the most toxic elements that exist. Arsenic can be found naturally in the environment and also be an essential trace element for some animals. Due to human activities, mainly through mining and melting, Arsenic can now be found on many more places than where they existed naturally.
World production of arsenic, in the form of its oxide, is around 50.000 ton per year. Chile and Mexico are primary exporters of Arsenic. Also, it is mainly emitted by the copper producing industries, but also during lead and zinc production and in agriculture. Arsenic can’t be destroyed once it has entered the environment, which causes severe health effects on humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/water/arsenic/arsenic-and-water.htm#ixzz0mflYN2Bk |title=Arsenic (As) and water : Arsenic and water: reaction mechanisms, environmental impact and health effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned before, Chile and Mexico are primary producers of Arsenic and when checking Arsenic limit values in their regulations aren’t the more severe ones.  Mexico and Brazil are the countries with a higher limit value and Ecuador stays with the lower limit. As Arsenic is also linked with agriculture, it is important to emphasize that the majority of the Latin-American countries are characterized by having an agricultural economy. As a result, limit values encountered for Arsenic in all the Regulations varies from a small range of 0,1 to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===Cadmium===
Cadmium is also considered as a substance of sanitary interest. Although, it can be found naturally in the environment and it always occurs in combination with zinc. In industry is a by-product of zinc, lead and copper extraction. Also is found in many manures and pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/as.htm#ixzz0mfjFkotg |title=Arsenic (As) – Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cadmium can easily end up in soils and transported to surface waters when using manures and pesticides.  Actually, regulations for Cadmium are strict, so little Cadmium enters the water through disposal of wastewater.

The main producing country is of zinc is Canada, with Mexico and Peru also being ones of the major suppliers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;CIA. The world Factbook. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In the regulations comparison, Cadmium standard was more severe in Ecuador with an acceptance of 0,02&amp;nbsp;mg/L, whilst Brazil was the laxer one with 1,5&amp;nbsp;mg/L. For the case of Canada, Mexico and Peru, the latter has the stricter limit among them with 0,2&amp;nbsp;mg/L, while the other two remain in the average with 0,7&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===Cyanide===
Cyanide, a substance of sanitary concern, is only due to use and discharge of the industrial sector. Cyanide has severe effects both in human health and ecosystems. The severity of the harmful effects following cyanide exposure depends in part on the form of cyanide, such as hydrogen cyanide gas or cyanide salts. It becomes more dangerous when exposure concentrations are high.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts8.html#bookmark03&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanide has been a major component of metal-plating solutions and is mainly produced for the mining of gold and silver mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php |title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide |publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of Latino-American regulations, Argentina is the country that presents the harshner limit value with 0,1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. By the contrary, Mexico was the one with the higher limit value with 1,5&amp;nbsp;mg/L.
Among the Latin-American countries, Colombia is the only one that is mentioned as having gold mining industry.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  The limit value for Cyanide is quite high (1&amp;nbsp;mg/L) to the limit value of Argentina. However, three more other countries have the same limit value for Cyanide.

===Hexavalent chromium===
This is a toxic component, that could cause allergic reactions on the skin and also several problems in the respiratory system.&lt;ref name =CR&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/cr.htm |title=Chromium (Cr) – Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a component present in the industries of chemicals, leather, textile, electro painting among others.&lt;ref name=CR /&gt;

The minimum requirement for this element is presented in Bolivia (0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/lt), and the maximum is presented in Mexico(0.75&amp;nbsp;mg/lt). Despite Brazil being one of the main producers of chromium, it doesn't have a maximum limit as do other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1935">'''Safe Working Load (SWL)''' sometimes stated as the '''Normal Working Load (NWL)''' is the maximum safe [[force]] that a piece of [[lifting equipment]], lifting device or accessory can exert to lift, suspend, or lower, a given [[mass]] without fear of breaking.  Usually marked on the equipment by the manufacturer. It is a calculation of the '''Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS)''' aka '''Minimum Breaking Load (MBL)''' divided by its risk factor, usually ten to one (10:1 or 1/10) for lifting equipment although depending on the application, other fractions may be used such as 1/4, 1/5 and 1/6.&lt;ref name="Working Load Limit Defined and Replaces Safe Working Load Terminology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Working Load Limit|title=Working Load Limit Defined and Replaces Safe Working Load Terminology|url=http://www.beyondrigging.com/2014/03/working-load-limit/}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="safe working load"&gt;nj{{cite web|last=SWL|title=safe working load|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/safe-working-load-SWL.html|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Working Load &amp; Safety Factors"&gt;{{cite web|last=Working Load|title=Working Load &amp; Safety Factors|url=http://amtecgrips.com/working-load-safety-factors|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other synonyms include '''Working Load Limit (WLL)''', which is the maximum working load designed by the manufacturer. This load represents a [[force]] that is much less than that required to make the lifting equipment fail or yield, also known as the '''SWL''' the '''WLL''' is calculated by dividing '''MBL''' by a [[safety factor]] ('''SF'''). An example of this would be a [[chain]] that has a '''MBL''' of 2000 [[lbf]] (8.89 [[Kilonewton|kN]]) would have a '''SWL''' or '''WLL''' of 400 lbf (1.78 kN) if a safety factor of 5 (5:1, 5 to 1, or 1/5) is used.

As such:

'''WLL''' = '''MBL / SF'''

[[File:Ill-2 O3.jpg|thumb|X-rays start at ~0.008 nm and extend across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to ~8 nm, over which the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]].]]
'''X-ray astronomy''' is an observational branch of [[astronomy]] which deals with the study of [[X-ray]] observation and detection from [[astronomical object]]s. [[X-radiation]] is absorbed by the [[Earth's atmosphere]], so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by [[Balloon-borne telescope|balloons]], [[sounding rocket]]s, and [[X-ray astronomy satellite|satellites]]. X-ray astronomy is the [[space science]] related to a type of [[space telescope]] that can see farther than standard light-absorption telescopes, such as the [[Mauna Kea Observatories]], via x-ray radiation.

[[X-ray generation|X-ray emission]] is expected from astronomical objects that contain extremely hot gases at temperatures from about a million [[kelvin]] (K) to hundreds of millions of kelvin (MK). Although X-rays have been observed emanating from the [[Sun]] since the 1940s, the discovery in 1962 of the first cosmic X-ray source was a surprise. This source is called [[Scorpius X-1]] (Sco X-1), the first X-ray source found in the [[constellation]] [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]]. The X-ray emission of Scorpius X-1 is 10,000 times greater than its visual emission, whereas that of the Sun is about a million times less. In addition, the energy output in X-rays is 100,000 times greater than the total emission of the [[Sun]] in all [[wavelength]]s. Based on discoveries in this new field of X-ray astronomy, starting with Scorpius X-1, [[Riccardo Giacconi]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2002. It is now known that such X-ray sources as Sco X-1 are [[compact star]]s, such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s. Material falling into a black hole may emit X-rays, but the black hole itself does not. The energy source for the X-ray emission is [[gravity]]. Infalling gas and dust is heated by the strong [[gravitational fields]] of these and other celestial objects.

Many thousands of X-ray sources are known. In addition, the space between [[galaxy|galaxies]] in [[galaxy clusters]] is filled with a very hot, but very dilute gas at a temperature between 10 and 100 megakelvins (MK). The total amount of hot gas is five to ten times the total mass in the visible galaxies.

==Sounding rocket flights==
{{main|Sounding rocket}}
The first sounding rocket flights for X-ray research were accomplished at the [[White Sands Missile Range]] in [[New Mexico]] with a [[V-2 rocket]] on January 28, 1949. A detector was placed in the [[nose cone]] section and the rocket was launched in a suborbital flight to an altitude just above the atmosphere.

X-rays from the Sun were detected by the U.S. [[Naval Research Laboratory]] Blossom experiment on board.&lt;ref name="rockooni"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology – Quarter 1 1949 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19491.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408082333/http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19491.htm |archivedate=April 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Aerobee]] 150 rocket was launched on June 12, 1962 and it detected the first X-rays from other celestial sources (Scorpius X-1).&lt;ref name=Giacconi&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Giacconi R |title=Nobel Lecture: The dawn of x-ray astronomy |journal=Rev Mod Phys|date=2003 |volume=75|issue=3|page=995|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.75.995 |bibcode=2003RvMP...75..995G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest drawback to rocket flights is their very short duration (just a few minutes above the atmosphere before the rocket falls back to Earth) and their limited [[field of view]]. A rocket launched from the United States will not be able to see sources in the southern sky; a rocket launched from Australia will not be able to see sources in the northern sky.

===X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) project===
[[File:Nike-Black Brant VC XQC launch.gif|thumb|right|A launch of the Black Brant 8 Microcalorimeter (XQC-2) at the turn of the century is a part of the joint undertaking by the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and [[NASA]]'s [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] known as the X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) project.]]
In astronomy, the [[interstellar medium]] (or '''ISM''') is the gas and [[cosmic dust]] that pervade interstellar space: the [[matter]] that exists between the [[star system]]s within a galaxy. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding [[intergalactic medium]]. The interstellar medium consists of an extremely dilute (by terrestrial standards) mixture of [[ion]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, larger dust grains, [[cosmic ray]]s, and (galactic) magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=Spitzer&gt;{{Cite book|author=Spitzer L |date=1978 |title=Physical Processes in the Interstellar Medium |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-471-29335-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy that occupies the same volume, in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], is the '''interstellar radiation field'''.

Of interest is the hot ionized medium (HIM) consisting of a [[coronal cloud]] ejection from star surfaces at 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; K which emits X-rays. The ISM is [[turbulence|turbulent]] and full of structure on all spatial scales. [[Star formation|Stars are born]] deep inside large complexes of [[molecular clouds]], typically a few [[parsec]]s in size. During their lives and deaths, [[star]]s interact physically with the ISM. [[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures are [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas. The Sun is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].

To measure the spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission from the interstellar medium over the energy range 0.07 to 1 keV, [[NASA]] launched a [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant 9]] from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico on May 1, 2008.&lt;ref name=McCammon&gt;{{cite web|author=Wright B |title=36.223 UH MCCAMMON/UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN |url=http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/news/story83.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511111524/http://sites.wff.nasa.gov/code810/news/story83.html |archivedate=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Principal Investigator for the mission is Dr. Dan McCammon of the [[University of Wisconsin]].

==Balloons==
{{main|Balloons for X-ray astronomy}}
Balloon flights can carry instruments to altitudes of up to 40&amp;nbsp;km above sea level, where they are above as much as 99.997% of the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike a rocket where data are collected during a brief few minutes, balloons are able to stay aloft for much longer. However, even at such altitudes, much of the X-ray [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] is still absorbed. X-rays with energies less than 35 keV (5,600 aJ) cannot reach balloons. On July 21, 1964, the [[Crab Nebula]] supernova remnant was discovered to be a hard X-ray (15 – 60 keV) source by a scintillation counter flown on a balloon launched from [[Palestine, Texas]], USA. This was likely the first balloon-based detection of X-rays from a discrete cosmic X-ray source.&lt;ref name=headates1&gt;{{cite web|author=Drake SA |title=A Brief History of High-Energy Astronomy: 1960–1964 |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/headates/1960.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-energy focusing telescope===
[[File:800crab.png|thumb|The [[Crab Nebula]] is a remnant of an exploded star. This image shows the Crab Nebula in various energy bands, including a hard X-ray image from the HEFT data taken during its 2005 observation run. Each image is 6′ wide.]]
The high-energy focusing telescope (HEFT) is a balloon-borne experiment to image astrophysical sources in the hard X-ray (20–100 keV) band.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Harrison FA|title=Development of the High-Energy Focusing Telescope (HEFT) balloon experiment|date=2000 |journal=Proc SPIE|volume=4012 |page=693 |doi=10.1117/12.391608|series=X-Ray Optics, Instruments, and Missions III|editor1-last=Truemper|editor1-first=Joachim E|last2=Boggs|first2=Steven E.|last3=Bolotnikov|first3=Aleksey E.|last4=Christensen|first4=Finn E.|last5=Cook Iii|first5=Walter R.|last6=Craig|first6=William W.|last7=Hailey|first7=Charles J.|last8=Jimenez-Garate|first8=Mario A.|last9=Mao|first9=Peter H.|displayauthors=8|editor2-last=Aschenbach|editor2-first=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maiden flight took place in May 2005 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The angular resolution of HEFT is ~1.5'. Rather than using a grazing-angle [[X-ray telescope]], HEFT makes use of a novel [[tungsten]]-silicon multilayer coatings to extend the reflectivity of nested grazing-incidence mirrors beyond 10 keV. HEFT has an energy resolution of 1.0 keV [[full width at half maximum]] at 60 keV. HEFT was launched for a 25-hour balloon flight in May 2005. The instrument performed within specification and observed [[SN 1054|Tau X-1]], the Crab Nebula.

===High-resolution gamma-ray and hard X-ray spectrometer (HIREGS)===
A balloon-borne experiment called the High-resolution gamma-ray and hard X-ray spectrometer (HIREGS) observed X-ray and gamma-rays emissions from the Sun and other astronomical objects.&lt;ref name="hiregs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/balloon/|title=HIREGS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feffer|first=Paul|year=1996|title=Solar energetic ion and electron limits from High Resolution Gamma-ray and Hard X-ray Spectrometer (HIREGS) Observations|url=|journal=Solar Physics|volume=171|issue=2|pages=419–445|doi=10.1023/A:1004911511905|bibcode=1997SoPh..171..419F}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched from [[McMurdo Station]], [[Antarctica]] in December 1991 and 1992.

==Rockoons==
{{main|Rockoon}}
[[File:Deacon Rockoon.jpg|thumb|Navy Deacon rockoon photographed just after a shipboard launch in July 1956.]]
The [[rockoon]] (a [[portmanteau]] of [[rocket]] and [[balloon]]) was a [[solid fuel rocket]] that, rather than being immediately lit while on the ground, was first carried into the upper atmosphere by a gas-filled balloon. Then, once separated from the balloon at its maximum height, the rocket was automatically ignited. This achieved a higher altitude, since the rocket did not have to move through the lower thicker air layers that would have required much more chemical fuel.

The original concept of "rockoons" was developed by Cmdr. Lee Lewis, Cmdr. G. Halvorson, S. F. Singer, and [[James A. Van Allen]] during the Aerobee rocket firing cruise of the {{USS|Norton Sound|AVM-1|6}} on March 1, 1949.&lt;ref name="rockooni"/&gt;

From July 17 to July 27, 1956, the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) shipboard launched eight [[Deacon (rocket)|Deacon]] rockoons for solar [[ultraviolet]] and X-ray observations at ~30° N ~121.6° W, southwest of [[San Clemente Island]], apogee: 120&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=nrl10&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology – Quarter 3 1956 |url=http://www.astronautix.com/chrono/19563.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-ray astronomy satellite==
{{main| X-ray astronomy satellite}}
X-ray astronomy satellites study X-ray emissions from celestial objects. Satellites, which can detect and transmit data about the X-ray emissions are deployed as part of branch of space science known as X-ray astronomy. Satellites are needed because X-radiation is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so instruments to detect X-rays must be taken to high altitude by balloons, sounding rockets, and satellites.

==X-ray telescopes and mirrors==
{{main|X-ray telescope}}
[[File:Xrtlayout.gif|thumb|The [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] contains a grazing incidence Wolter I telescope (XRT) to focus X-rays onto a state-of-the-art CCD.]]
X-ray telescopes (XRTs) have varying directionality or imaging ability based on glancing angle reflection rather than refraction or large deviation reflection.&lt;ref name=swift&gt;{{cite web |title=SWIFT X-ray mirrors |url=http://swift.sonoma.edu/about_swift/instruments/xrt.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chandra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/telescope_system.html |title=Chandra X-ray focusing mirrors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This limits them to much narrower fields of view than visible or UV telescopes. The mirrors can be made of ceramic or metal foil.&lt;ref name=xrayoptics&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astrophysics.gsfc.nasa.gov/xrays/MirrorLab/xoptics.html |title=X-ray optics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first X-ray telescope in astronomy was used to observe the Sun. The first X-ray picture (taken with a grazing incidence telescope) of the Sun was taken in 1963, by a rocket-borne telescope. On April 19, 1960 the very first X-ray image of the sun was taken using a pinhole camera on an Aerobee-Hi rocket.&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blake|first=R. L.|author2=Chubb, T. A. |author3=Friedman, H. |author4=Unzicker, A. E. |title=Interpretation of X-Ray Photograph of the Sun|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=January 1963|volume=137|page=3|doi=10.1086/147479|bibcode = 1963ApJ...137....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utilization of X-ray mirrors for extrasolar X-ray astronomy simultaneously requires:
* the ability to determine the location at the arrival of an X-ray photon in two dimensions and
* a reasonable detection efficiency.

==X-ray astronomy detectors==
[[File:Proportional Counter Array RXTE.jpg|thumb|right|Proportional Counter Array on the [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]] (RXTE) satellite.]]
{{main|X-ray astronomy detectors}}
X-ray astronomy detectors have been designed and configured primarily for energy and occasionally for wavelength detection using a variety of techniques usually limited to the technology of the time.

X-ray detectors collect individual X-rays (photons of X-ray electromagnetic radiation) and count the number of photons collected (intensity), the energy (0.12 to 120 keV) of the photons collected, wavelength (~0.008 to 8&amp;nbsp;nm), or how fast the photons are detected (counts per hour), to tell us about the object that is emitting them.

==Astrophysical sources of X-rays==
{{main|Astrophysical X-ray source}}

Several types of astrophysical objects emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays, from [[galaxy cluster]]s, through black holes in [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) to galactic objects such as [[supernova remnant]]s, stars, and [[binary star]]s containing a [[white dwarf]] ([[cataclysmic variable star]]s and [[super soft X-ray source]]s), neutron star or black hole ([[X-ray binaries]]). Some [[solar system]] bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the [[Moon]], although most of the X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed [[X-ray background]]. The X-ray continuum can arise from [[bremsstrahlung]], [[Thermal radiation|black-body radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], or what is called [[Compton scattering#Inverse Compton scattering|inverse Compton scattering]] of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Morrison P |title=Extrasolar X-ray Sources |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=1967 |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=325 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.05.090167.001545 |bibcode=1967ARA&amp;A...5..325M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[intermediate-mass X-ray binary]] (IMXB) is a binary star system where one of the components is a neutron star or a black hole. The other component is an intermediate mass star.&lt;ref name=Podsiadlowski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Podsiadlowski P |author2=Rappaport S |author3=Pfahl E |title=Evolutionary Binary Sequences for Low- and Intermediate-Mass X-ray Binaries |date=2001 |doi=10.1086/324686 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=565 |issue=2 |pages=1107 |arxiv=astro-ph/0107261|bibcode = 2002ApJ...565.1107P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hercules X-1]] is composed of a neutron star accreting matter from a normal star (HZ Herculis) probably due to Roche lobe overflow. X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline, {{Solar mass|~2|link=y}}, between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.&lt;ref name=Priedhorsky&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Priedhorsky WC|author2= Holt SS |title=Long-term cycles in cosmic X-ray sources |journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=45|date=1987|issue=3–4 |page=291|doi=10.1007/BF00171997 |bibcode=1987SSRv...45..291P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celestial X-ray sources==
{{main|Astrophysical X-ray source}}
The [[celestial sphere]] has been divided into 88 constellations. The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) constellations are areas of the sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be [[galaxies]] or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are [[pulsar]]s. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the [[universe]] as a whole, and how these affect us on [[Earth]]. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy has been around for a long time. Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends to focus on the physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.

[[File:Orion-Eridanus Bubble.gif|thumb|right|This [[ROSAT]] PSPC false-color image is of a portion of a nearby stellar wind superbubble (the [[Orion-Eridanus Superbubble]]) stretching across [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].]]
Within the constellations Orion and Eridanus and stretching across them is a soft X-ray "hot spot" known as the [[Orion-Eridanus Superbubble]], the '''Eridanus Soft X-ray Enhancement''', or simply the '''Eridanus Bubble''', a 25° area of interlocking arcs of Hα emitting filaments. Soft X-rays are emitted by hot gas (T ~ 2–3 MK) in the interior of the superbubble. This bright object forms the background for the "shadow" of a filament of gas and dust. The filament is shown by the overlaid contours, which represent 100 micrometre emission from dust at a temperature of about 30 K as measured by [[IRAS]]. Here the filament absorbs soft X-rays between 100 and 300 eV, indicating that the hot gas is located behind the filament. This filament may be part of a shell of neutral gas that surrounds the hot bubble. Its interior is energized by [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light and stellar winds from hot stars in the Orion OB1 association. These stars energize a superbubble about 1200 lys across which is observed in the visual (Hα) and X-ray portions of the spectrum.

==Proposed (future) X-ray observatory satellites==
{{main| X-ray astronomy satellite}}
There are several projects that are proposed for X-ray observatory satellites. See main article link above.

==Explorational X-ray astronomy==
[[File:Ulysses 2 orbit.jpg|thumb|right|Ulysses' second orbit: it arrived at [[Jupiter]] on February 8, 1992, for a [[swing-by maneuver]] that increased its inclination to the [[ecliptic]] by 80.2 degrees.]]
Usually observational astronomy is considered to occur on Earth's surface (or beneath it in [[neutrino astronomy]]). The idea of limiting observation to Earth includes orbiting the Earth. As soon as the observer leaves the cozy confines of Earth, the observer becomes a deep space explorer.&lt;ref name=Kawakatsu&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kawakatsu Y |title=Concept study on Deep Space Orbit Transfer Vehicle |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=Dec 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11–12 |pages=1019–28 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576507001300|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.12.019 |bibcode = 2007AcAau..61.1019K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for [[Explorer 1]] and [[Explorer 3]] and the earlier satellites in the series,&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|author=Smith W |title=Explorer Series of Spacecraft |url=https://history.nasa.gov/explorer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually if a probe is going to be a deep space explorer it leaves the Earth or an orbit around the Earth.

For a satellite or space probe to qualify as a deep space X-ray astronomer/explorer or "astronobot"/explorer, all it needs to carry aboard is an XRT or X-ray detector and leave Earth orbit.

[[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] was launched October 6, 1990, and reached Jupiter for its "[[Gravity assist|gravitational slingshot]]" in February 1992. It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 and crossed the ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. Ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its operating mode depending on (1) measured count rate, (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; erg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1 nJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution data, recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from the sum of the 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations). During 'wait' mode, the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels (with shortest integration time being 8 s). Again, the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed.

The Ulysses soft X-ray detectors consisted of 2.5-mm thick × 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area Si surface barrier detectors. A 100&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; beryllium foil front window rejected the low energy X-rays and defined a conical FOV of 75° (half-angle). These detectors were passively cooled and operate in the temperature range −35 to −55&amp;nbsp;°C. This detector had 6 energy channels, covering the range 5–20 keV.

==Theoretical X-ray astronomy==
Theoretical X-ray astronomy is a branch of [[theoretical astronomy]] that deals with the theoretical [[astrophysics]] and theoretical [[astrochemistry]] of [[X-ray generation]], emission, and detection as applied to [[astronomical object]]s.

Like [[theoretical astrophysics]], theoretical X-ray astronomy uses a wide variety of tools which include [[Mathematical model|analytical model]]s to approximate the behavior of a possible X-ray source and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulation]]s to approximate the observational data. Once potential observational consequences are available they can be compared with experimental observations. Observers can look for data that refutes a model or helps in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Most of the topics in [[astrophysics]], [[astrochemistry]], [[astrometry]], and other fields that are branches of [[astronomy]] studied by theoreticians involve X-rays and X-ray sources. Many of the beginnings for a theory can be found in an Earth-based laboratory where an X-ray source is built and studied.

===Dynamos===
{{main|Dynamo theory}}
{{See also|Solar dynamo}}
Dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating, convecting, and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a [[magnetic field]]. This theory is used to explain the presence of anomalously long-lived magnetic fields in astrophysical bodies. If some of the stellar magnetic fields are really induced by dynamos, then field strength might be associated with rotation rate.&lt;ref name=Trimble&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Trimble V |title=White dwarfs in the 1990s |journal=Bull Astron Soc India|date=1999 |volume=27 |page=549 |bibcode=1999BASI...27..549T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical models===
[[File:NASA-2015IYL-MultiPix-ChandraXRayObservatory-20150122.jpg|thumb|right|Images released to celebrate the [[International Year of Light|International Year of Light 2015]]&lt;br&gt;([[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]]).]]
From the observed X-ray spectrum, combined with spectral emission results for other wavelength ranges, an astronomical model addressing the likely source of X-ray emission can be constructed. For example, with Scorpius X-1 the X-ray spectrum steeply drops off as X-ray energy increases up to 20 keV, which is likely for a thermal-plasma mechanism.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; In addition, there is no radio emission, and the visible continuum is roughly what would be expected from a hot plasma fitting the observed X-ray flux.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; The plasma could be a [[coronal cloud]] of a central object or a transient plasma, where the energy source is unknown, but could be related to the idea of a close binary.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;

In the Crab Nebula X-ray spectrum there are three features that differ greatly from Scorpius X-1: its spectrum is much harder, its source diameter is in [[light-year]]s (ly)s, not [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), and its radio and optical synchrotron emission are strong.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt; Its overall X-ray luminosity rivals the optical emission and could be that of a nonthermal plasma. However, the Crab Nebula appears as an X-ray source that is a central freely expanding ball of dilute plasma, where the energy content is 100 times the total energy content of the large visible and radio portion, obtained from the unknown source.&lt;ref name=Morrison/&gt;

The [[Astrophysical X-ray source#X-ray dark stars|"Dividing Line"]] as [[giant star]]s evolve to become [[red giant]]s also coincides with the Wind and Coronal Dividing Lines.&lt;ref name=Kashyap&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kashyap V|author2= Rosner R|author3=Harnden FR Jr.|author4=Maggio A|author5=Micela G|author6=Sciortino S |title=X-ray emission on hybird stars: ROSAT observations of alpha Trianguli Australis and IOTA Aurigae |journal=Astrophys J|date=1994|volume=431 |page=402|doi=10.1086/174494 |bibcode=1994ApJ...431..402K}}&lt;/ref&gt; To explain the drop in X-ray emission across these dividing lines, a number of models have been proposed:
# low transition region densities, leading to low emission in coronae,
# high-density wind extinction of coronal emission,
# only cool coronal loops become stable,
# changes in a magnetic field structure to that an open topology, leading to a decrease of magnetically confined plasma, or
# changes in the magnetic dynamo character, leading to the disappearance of stellar fields leaving only small-scale, turbulence-generated fields among red giants.&lt;ref name=Kashyap/&gt;

==Analytical X-ray astronomy==
Analytical X-ray astronomy is applied to an astronomy puzzle in an attempt to provide an acceptable solution. Consider the following puzzle.

[[High-mass X-ray binaries]] (HMXBs) are composed of OB supergiant companion stars and compact objects, usually [[neutron stars]] (NS) or [[black holes]] (BH). Supergiant X-ray binaries (SGXBs) are HMXBs in which the compact objects orbit massive companions with orbital periods of a few days (3–15 d), and in circular (or slightly eccentric) orbits. SGXBs show typical the hard X-ray spectra of accreting [[pulsar]]s and most show strong absorption as obscured HMXBs. X-ray luminosity (''L''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) increases up to 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; watts).

The mechanism triggering the different temporal behavior observed between the classical SGXBs and the recently discovered [[X-ray transient#Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs)|supergiant fast X-ray transients]] (SFXT)s is still debated.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zurita Heras JA|author2= Chaty S |title=Discovery of an eccentric 30 day period in the supergiant X-ray binary SAX J1818.6–1703 with INTEGRAL |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2009 |volume=493|issue=1 |page=L1|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:200811179 |bibcode=2009A&amp;A...493L...1Z|arxiv = 0811.2941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aim: use the discovery of long orbits (&gt;15 d) to help discriminate between emission models and perhaps bring constraints on the models.

Method: analyze archival data on various SGXBs such as has been obtained by [[INTEGRAL]] for candidates exhibiting long orbits. Build short- and long-term light curves. Perform a timing analysis in order to study the temporal behavior of each candidate on different time scales.

Compare various astronomical models:
* direct spherical accretion
* Roche-Lobe overflow via an accretion disk on the compact object.

Draw some conclusions: for example, the SGXB SAX J1818.6-1703 was discovered by [[BeppoSAX]] in 1998, identified as a SGXB of spectral type between O9I−B1I, which also displayed short and bright flares and an unusually very low quiescent level leading to its classification as a SFXT.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras/&gt; The analysis indicated an unusually long orbital period: 30.0 ± 0.2 d and an elapsed accretion phase of ~6 d implying an elliptical orbit and possible supergiant spectral type between B0.5-1I with eccentricities e ~ 0.3–0.4.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras/&gt; The large variations in the X-ray flux can be explained through accretion of macro-clumps formed within the stellar wind.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras/&gt;

Choose which model seems to work best: for SAX J1818.6-1703 the analysis best fits the model that predicts SFXTs behave as SGXBs with different orbital parameters; hence, different temporal behavior.&lt;ref name=ZuritaHeras/&gt;

==Stellar X-ray astronomy==
Stellar X-ray astronomy is said to have started on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from [[Capella (star)|Capella]].&lt;ref name=Catura&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Catura RC|author2= Acton LW|author3=Johnson HM |title=Evidence for X-ray emission from Capella |journal=Astrophys J |date=1975 |volume=196|page=L47|doi=10.1086/181741 |bibcode=1975ApJ...196L..47C}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella (α Aur). During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor.&lt;ref name=Catura/&gt; The X-ray luminosity of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; W) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity.&lt;ref name=Catura/&gt;

X-ray emission from an enhanced solar-like corona was proposed for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mewe1/&gt; The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using [[HEAO 1]] required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

In 1977 [[Proxima Centauri]] is discovered to be emitting high-energy radiation in the XUV. In 1978, α Cen was identified as a low-activity coronal source.&lt;ref name=Telleschi&gt;{{cite web|author=Telleschi AS |title=Coronal Evolution of Solar-Like Stars in Star-Forming Regions and the Solar Neighborhood |url=http://www.astro.phys.ethz.ch/papers/atellesc/diss/diss.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the operation of the [[Einstein Observatory|Einstein]] observatory, X-ray emission was recognized as a characteristic feature common to a wide range of stars covering essentially the whole Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.&lt;ref name=Telleschi/&gt; The Einstein initial survey led to significant insights:
*X-ray sources abound among all types of stars, across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and across most stages of evolution,
*the X-ray luminosities and their distribution along the main sequence were not in agreement with the long-favored acoustic heating theories, but were now interpreted as the effect of magnetic coronal heating, and
*stars that are otherwise similar reveal large differences in their X-ray output if their rotation period is different.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

To fit the medium-resolution spectrum of UX Ari, subsolar abundances were required.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

Stellar X-ray astronomy is contributing toward a deeper understanding of
*magnetic fields in magnetohydrodynamic dynamos,
*the release of energy in tenuous astrophysical plasmas through various plasma-physical processes, and
*the interactions of high-energy radiation with the stellar environment.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

Current wisdom has it that the massive coronal main sequence stars are late-A or early F stars, a conjecture that is supported both by observation and by theory.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Young, low-mass stars===
{{main|pre-main-sequence star}}
[[File:Chandra_X-ray_View_of_Orion.jpg|thumb|right|A Chandra X-ray image of the [[Trapezium Cluster|Cluster]] of [[star formation|newly formed stars]] in the [[Orion Nebula]].]]
Newly formed stars are known as [[pre-main-sequence star]]s during the stage of stellar evolution before they reach the [[main-sequence]]. Stars in this stage (ages &lt;10 million years) produce X-rays in their stellar coronae. However, their X-ray emission is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; times stronger than for main-sequence stars of similar masses.&lt;ref name=preibisch05&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Preibisch | first = T. | display-authors = etal | year= 2005| title = The Origin of T Tauri X-Ray Emission: New Insights from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project | journal = Astrophysical Journal Supplement | volume = 160 | issue =2 | pages = 401–422 | doi = 10.1086/432891| bibcode = 2005ApJS..160..401P|arxiv = astro-ph/0506526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-ray emission as an indicator of stellar youth is important for studies of star-forming regions. Most star-forming regions in the Milky Way Galaxy are projected on [[Zone of Avoidance|Galactic-Plane fields]] with numerous unrelated field stars. It is often impossible to distinguish members of a young stellar cluster from field-star contaminants using optical and infrared images alone. X-ray emission can easily penetrate moderate absorption from molecular clouds, and can be used to identify candidate cluster members.&lt;ref name=feigelson13&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Feigelson | first = E.

===Unstable winds===
Given the lack of a significant outer convection zone, theory predicts the absence of a magnetic dynamo in earlier A stars.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; In early stars of spectral type O and B, shocks developing in unstable winds are the likely source of X-rays.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Coolest M dwarfs===
Beyond spectral type M5, the classical αω dynamo can no longer operate as the internal structure of dwarf stars changes significantly: they become fully convective.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; As a distributed (or α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) dynamo may become relevant, both the magnetic flux on the surface and the topology of the magnetic fields in the corona should systematically change across this transition, perhaps resulting in some discontinuities in the X-ray characteristics around spectral class dM5.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; However, observations do not seem to support this picture: long-time lowest-mass X-ray detection, VB 8 (M7e V), has shown steady emission at levels of X-ray luminosity (''L''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; W) and flares up to an order of magnitude higher.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; Comparison with other late M dwarfs shows a rather continuous trend.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===Strong X-ray emission from Herbig Ae/Be stars===
{{main|Herbig Ae/Be star}}
Herbig Ae/Be stars are pre-main sequence stars. As to their X-ray emission properties, some are
* reminiscent of hot stars,
* others point to coronal activity as in cool stars, in particular the presence of flares and very high temperatures.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

The nature of these strong emissions has remained controversial with models including
* unstable stellar winds,
* colliding winds,
* magnetic coronae,
* disk coronae,
* wind-fed magnetospheres,
* accretion shocks,
* the operation of a shear dynamo,
* the presence of unknown late-type companions.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

===K giants===
The FK Com stars are giants of spectral type K with an unusually rapid rotation and signs of extreme activity. Their X-ray coronae are among the most luminous (''L''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; erg·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; W) and the hottest known with dominant temperatures up to 40 MK.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; However, the current popular hypothesis involves a merger of a close binary system in which the orbital angular momentum of the companion is transferred to the primary.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

[[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] is the brightest star in the constellation [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], despite its Beta designation, and the 17th brightest in the sky. Pollux is a giant orange K star that makes an interesting color contrast with its white "twin", Castor. Evidence has been found for a hot, outer, magnetically supported corona around Pollux, and the star is known to be an X-ray emitter.&lt;ref name=Hatzes&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=8|author=Hatzes AP|author2=Cochran WD|author3=Endl M|author4=Guenther EW|author5=Saar SH|author6=Walker GAH|author7=Yang S|author8=Hartmann M|author9=Esposito M|author10=Paulson DB|author11=Döllinger MP |title=Confirmation of the planet hypothesis for the long-period radial velocity variations of β Geminorum |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2006 |volume=457|issue=1 |page=335|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20065445 |bibcode=2006A&amp;A...457..335H|arxiv = astro-ph/0606517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ECARmulticolor4.tnl.jpg|thumb|right|Classified as a [[Peculiar star]], Eta Carinae exhibits a superstar at its center as seen in this image from [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. Credit: Chandra Science Center and NASA.]]
New X-ray observations by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] show three distinct structures: an outer, horseshoe-shaped ring about 2 light years in diameter, a hot inner core about 3 light-months in diameter, and a hot central source less than 1 light-month in diameter which may contain the superstar that drives the whole show. The outer ring provides evidence of another large explosion that occurred over 1,000 years ago. These three structures around [[Eta Carinae]] are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds. The temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 MK in the central regions to 3 MK on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure. "The Chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense X-rays," says Prof. Kris Davidson of the [[University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=Horack&gt;{{cite web|title=Chandra Takes X-ray Image of Repeat Offender |url=https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast08oct99_1.htm |date=October 8, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson is principal investigator for the Eta Carina observations by the [[Hubble Space telescope]]. "In the most popular theory, X-rays are made by colliding gas streams from two stars so close together that they'd look like a point source to us. But what happens to gas streams that escape to farther distances? The extended hot stuff in the middle of the new image gives demanding new conditions for any theory to meet."&lt;ref name=Horack/&gt;

==Amateur X-ray astronomy==
{{main|Amateur X-ray astronomy}}
Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves.

There are major limitations to amateurs observing and reporting experiments in X-ray astronomy: the cost of building an amateur rocket or balloon to place a detector high enough and the cost of appropriate parts to build a suitable X-ray detector.

In 1927, E.O. Hulburt of the [[US Naval Research Laboratory]] and associates [[Gregory Breit]] and [[Merle A. Tuve]] of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] explored the possibility of equipping [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s rockets to explore the upper atmosphere. "Two years later, he proposed an experimental program in which a rocket might be instrumented to explore the upper atmosphere, including detection of ultraviolet radiation and X-rays at high altitudes".&lt;ref name=Spacelab2&gt;{{cite web|title=Spacelab 2 NRL Looks at the Sun |url=http://wwwsolar.nrl.navy.mil/sl2_pub.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1930s, the presence of a very hot, tenuous gas surrounding the Sun was inferred indirectly from optical coronal lines of highly ionized species.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; The Sun has been known to be surrounded by a hot tenuous corona.&lt;ref name=Grottian&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Grottian W |journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=27 |page=214|doi=10.1007/BF01488890|title=Zur Frage der Deutung der Linien im Spektrum der Sonnenkorona|date=1939|issue=13|bibcode = 1939NW.....27..214G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1940s radio observations revealed a radio corona around the Sun.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

The beginning of the search for X-ray sources from above the Earth's atmosphere was on [[Spaceflight before 1951|August 5, 1948 12:07]] GMT. A US Army (formerly German) [[V-2 rocket]] as part of [[Hermes project|Project Hermes]] was launched from [[White Sands Proving Grounds]]. The first solar X-rays were recorded by T. Burnight.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Keller CU |title=X-rays from the Sun |journal=Cell Mol Life Sci|date=1995 |volume=51|issue=7 |page=710|doi=10.1007/BF01941268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the sensitivity of detectors increased greatly during the 60 years of X-ray astronomy. In addition, the ability to focus X-rays has developed enormously—allowing the production of high-quality images of many fascinating celestial objects.

==Major questions in X-ray astronomy==
As X-ray astronomy uses a major spectral probe to peer into source, it is a valuable tool in efforts to understand many puzzles.

===Stellar magnetic fields===
Magnetic fields are ubiquitous among stars, yet we do not understand precisely why, nor have we fully understood the bewildering variety of plasma physical mechanisms that act in stellar environments.&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt; Some stars, for example, seem to have magnetic fields, [[fossil stellar magnetic field]]s left over from their period of formation, while others seem to generate the field anew frequently.

===Extrasolar X-ray source astrometry===
{{main|Extrasolar X-ray source astrometry}}
With the initial detection of an extrasolar X-ray source, the first question usually asked is "What is the source?" An extensive search is often made in other wavelengths such as visible or radio for possible coincident objects. Many of the verified X-ray locations still do not have readily discernible sources. X-ray [[astrometry]] becomes a serious concern that results in ever greater demands for finer [[angular resolution]] and [[Radiance|spectral radiance]].

There are inherent difficulties in making X-ray/optical, X-ray/radio, and X-ray/X-ray identifications based solely on positional coincidents, especially with handicaps in making identifications, such as the large uncertainties in positional determinants made from balloons and rockets, poor source separation in the crowded region toward the galactic center, source variability, and the multiplicity of source nomenclature.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Thomas RM|author2=Davison PJN |title=A comment on X-ray source identifications |journal=Astron Soc Australia, Proc|date=1974 |volume=2 |page=290|bibcode=1974PASAu...2..290T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X‐ray source counterparts to stars can be identified by calculating the angular separation between source centroids and position of the star. The maximum allowable separation is a compromise between a larger value to identify as many real matches as possible and a smaller value to minimize the probability of spurious matches. "An adopted matching criterion of 40" finds nearly all possible X‐ray source matches while keeping the probability of any spurious matches in the sample to 3%."&lt;ref name=Gaidos&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gaidos EJ |title=Nearby Young Solar Analogs.

===Solar X-ray astronomy===
{{Main|Solar X-ray astronomy}}
All of the detected X-ray sources at, around, or near the [[Sun]] appear to be associated with processes in the [[corona]], which is its outer atmosphere.

====Coronal heating problem====
In the area of solar X-ray astronomy, there is the [[Corona#Coronal heating problem|coronal heating problem]].

It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt; The first is [[wave]] heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt; These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat.&lt;ref name=Alfven&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Alfvén H |title=Magneto-hydrodynamic waves, and the heating of the solar corona |bibcode=1947MNRAS.107..211A|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=107|issue=2 |page=211 |date=1947 |doi=10.1093/mnras/107.2.211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is [[magnetic field|magnetic]] heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through [[magnetic reconnection]] in the form of large [[solar flare]]s and myriad similar but smaller events—[[nanoflares]].&lt;ref name=Parker2&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Parker EN |title=Nanoflares and the solar X-ray corona|journal=Astrophys J|volume=330 |page=474 |date=1988 |doi=10.1086/166485 |bibcode=1988ApJ...330..474P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except [[Alfvén wave]]s have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.&lt;ref name=Sturrock&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Sturrock PA|author2=Uchida Y |title=Coronal heating by stochastic magnetic pumping|journal=Astrophys J|volume=246|page=331 |date=1981 |doi=10.1086/158926 |bibcode=1981ApJ...246..331S|hdl=2060/19800019786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Erdelyi/&gt;

====Coronal mass ejection====
A [[coronal mass ejection]] (CME) is an ejected plasma consisting primarily of electrons and [[proton]]s (in addition to small quantities of heavier elements such as helium, oxygen, and iron), plus the entraining coronal closed magnetic field regions. Evolution of these closed magnetic structures in response to various photospheric motions over different time scales (convection, differential rotation, meridional circulation) somehow leads to the CME.&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gopalswamy N|author2=Mikic Z|author3=Maia D|author4=Alexander D|author5=Cremades H|author6=Kaufmann P|author7=Tripathi D|author8= Wang YM |title=The pre-CME Sun |journal=Space Science Reviews|date=2006 |volume=123|issue=1–3 |page=303|doi=10.1007/s11214-006-9020-2|bibcode = 2006SSRv..123..303G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale energetic signatures such as plasma heating (observed as compact soft X-ray brightening) may be indicative of impending CMEs.

The soft X-ray sigmoid (an S-shaped intensity of soft X-rays) is an observational manifestation of the connection between coronal structure and CME production.&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy/&gt; "Relating the sigmoids at X-ray (and other) wavelengths to magnetic structures and current systems in the solar atmosphere is the key to understanding their relationship to CMEs."&lt;ref name=Gopalswamy/&gt;

The first detection of a Coronal mass ejection (CME) as such was made on December 1, 1971 by R. Tousey of the US Naval Research Laboratory using [[OSO 7]].&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{cite web|title=R.A.Howard, A Historical Perspective on Coronal Mass Ejections |url=http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/summerschool/lectures/vourlidas/AV_intro2CMEs/additional%20material/corona_history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier observations of '''coronal transients''' or even phenomena observed visually during [[solar eclipses]] are now understood as essentially the same thing.

The largest geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a "prehistoric" CME, coincided with the first-observed solar flare, in 1859. The flare was observed visually by [[Richard Christopher Carrington]] and the [[geomagnetic storm]] was observed with the recording magnetograph at [[Kew Gardens]]. The same instrument recorded a '''crotchet''', an instantaneous perturbation of the Earth's ionosphere by ionizing soft X-rays. This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays (by [[Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen|Roentgen]]) and the recognition of the [[ionosphere]] (by [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly|Kennelly]] and [[Heaviside]]).

==Exotic X-ray sources==
{{main|Astrophysical X-ray source}}
{{See also|Be X-ray binaries}}
A [[microquasar]] is a smaller cousin of a [[quasar]] that is a radio emitting [[X-ray binary]], with an often resolvable pair of radio jets.
[[LS I +61 303|LSI+61°303]] is a periodic, radio-emitting binary system that is also the gamma-ray source, CG135+01.
Observations are revealing a growing number of recurrent [[X-ray transient]]s, characterized by short outbursts with very fast rise times (tens of minutes) and typical durations of a few hours that are associated with OB [[supergiant]]s and hence define a new class of massive X-ray binaries: Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs).
Observations made by [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] indicate the presence of loops and rings in the hot X-ray emitting gas that surrounds [[Messier 87]]. A '''[[magnetar]]''' is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field, the decay of which powers the emission of copious amounts of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, particularly X-rays and [[gamma ray]]s.

==X-ray dark stars==

During the solar cycle, as shown in the sequence of images at right, at times the Sun is almost X-ray dark, almost an X-ray variable. [[Betelgeuse]], on the other hand, appears to be always X-ray dark. Hardly any X-rays are emitted by red giants. There is a rather abrupt onset of X-ray emission around spectral type A7-F0, with a large range of luminosities developing across spectral class F. Altair is spectral type A7V and Vega is A0V. Altair's total X-ray luminosity is at least an order of magnitude larger than the X-ray luminosity for Vega. The outer convection zone of early F stars is expected to be very shallow and absent in A-type dwarfs, yet the acoustic flux from the interior reaches a maximum for late A and early F stars provoking investigations of magnetic activity in A-type stars along three principal lines. Chemically peculiar stars of spectral type Bp or Ap are appreciable magnetic radio sources, most Bp/Ap stars remain undetected, and of those reported early on as producing X-rays only few of them can be identified as probably single stars. X-ray observations offer the possibility to detect (X-ray dark) planets as they eclipse part of the corona of their parent star while in transit. "Such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a Jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area."

"Such methods are particularly promising for low-mass stars as a Jupiter-like planet could eclipse a rather significant coronal area."&lt;ref name=Gudel/&gt;

As X-ray detectors have become more sensitive, they have observed that some planets and other normally X-ray non-luminescent celestial objects under certain conditions emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays.

===Comet Lulin===
[[File:Comet Lulin Jan. 28-2009 Swift gamma.jpg|thumb|right|Image of Comet Lulin on 28 January 2009, when the comet was 99.5 million miles from Earth and 115.3 million miles from the Sun, from [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|''Swift'']]. Data from Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope is shown in blue and green, and from its X-Ray Telescope in red.]]
{{main|Comet Lulin}}
NASA's [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] satellite was monitoring [[Comet Lulin]] as it closed to 63 Gm of Earth. For the first time, astronomers can see simultaneous UV and X-ray images of a comet. "The solar wind—a fast-moving stream of particles from the sun—interacts with the comet's broader cloud of atoms. This causes the solar wind to light up with X-rays, and that's what Swift's XRT sees", said Stefan Immler, of the Goddard Space Flight Center. This interaction, called charge exchange, results in X-rays from most comets when they pass within about three times Earth's distance from the Sun. Because Lulin is so active, its atomic cloud is especially dense. As a result, the X-ray-emitting region extends far sunward of the comet.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite web|author=Reddy F |title=NASA's Swift Spies Comet Lulin |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/lulin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
