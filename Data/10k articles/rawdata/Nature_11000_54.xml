'''2011 MD''' is a bright micro-[[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] and [[Amor asteroid|Amor group]], respectively.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; On 27 June 2011, at around 17:00 UTC (13:00 EDT), the object passed exceptionally close to Earth's surface at a distance of approximately {{convert|12000|km|mi|-2|sp=us}}, roughly the diameter of the Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-news" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SKY1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NatGeo" /&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:2011 MD on Jun 26.jpg|thumb|left|{{mp|2011 MD}} on 26 June 2011]]

Although {{mp|2011 MD}} was initially believed to be [[space debris|space junk]], subsequent observations confirmed that it is an asteroid. A few hours before the asteroid's nearest approach in 2011, it appeared close to the Sun, so observations were possible for only a brief period. Backyard astronomers were able to observe it with telescopes from Australia, southern Africa, and the Americas.&lt;ref name="SKY1" /&gt;

{{mp|2011 MD}} was discovered on 22 June 2011, by astronomers of the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR) at the U.S. [[Lincoln Laboratory Experimental Test Site]] in Socorro, New Mexico, by a pair of robotic telescopes. According to original rough estimates, the asteroid's length was between {{convert|10|and|45|m|ft|-1|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MANIA"/&gt; However, according to the more recent [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] (H) measurement of 28.1&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; and its albedo of 0.3, the asteroid is closer to 6 meters or 20 feet in diameter.&lt;ref name="Mommert2014"/&gt;

Emily Baldwin of ''[[Astronomy Now]]'' said that there was no threat of collision, and should the asteroid enter [[Earth's atmosphere]], it would "mostly burn up in a brilliant fireball, possibly scattering a few [[meteorite]]s", causing no likely harm to life or property on the ground.&lt;ref name="MANIA" /&gt;

The 27 June 2011 close approach to Earth increased the orbital period of {{mp|2011 MD}} from 380 days to 396 days. During close approach the asteroid passed Earth at a relative speed of 6.7&amp;nbsp;km/s&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; with a [[geocentric]] eccentricity of 1.1.

{{mp|2011 MD}} was observed by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] in February 2014 and estimated to be {{convert|6|m|0|sp=us}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="NASA2014-195"/&gt; The asteroid is a [[porous]] [[rubble pile]] with a density similar to water.&lt;ref name="NASA2014-195"/&gt; On 19 June 2014, NASA reported that asteroid {{mp|2011 MD}} was a prime candidate for [[Asteroid capture|capture]] by the [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] (ARM) in the early 2020s.&lt;ref name="AP-20140619" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4503">An '''aeromagnetic survey''' is a common type of [[geophysical survey]] carried out using a [[magnetometer]] aboard or towed behind an aircraft. The principle is similar to a magnetic survey carried out with a hand-held magnetometer, but allows much larger areas of the Earth's surface to be covered quickly for regional reconnaissance. The aircraft typically flies in a grid-like pattern with height and line spacing determining the resolution of the data (and cost of the survey per unit area).

== Method ==
As the aircraft flies, the magnetometer measures and records the total intensity of the [[magnetic field]] at the sensor, which is a combination of the desired magnetic field generated in the [[Earth]] as well as tiny variations due to the temporal effects of the constantly varying [[solar wind]] and the magnetic field of the survey aircraft. By subtracting the solar, regional, and aircraft effects, the resulting aeromagnetic map shows the spatial distribution and relative abundance of magnetic minerals (most commonly the [[iron oxide]] mineral [[magnetite]]) in the upper levels of the [[Earth's crust]]. Because different rock types differ in their content of magnetic minerals, the magnetic map allows a visualization of the [[Structural geology|geological structure]] of the upper crust in the subsurface, particularly the spatial geometry of bodies of rock and the presence of faults and folds. This is particularly useful where bedrock is obscured by surface sand, soil or water. Aeromagnetic data was once presented as contour plots, but now is more commonly expressed as [[Theme (computing)|thematic]] (colored) and shaded computer generated pseudo-topography images. The apparent hills, ridges and valleys are referred to as [[magnetic anomaly|aeromagnetic anomalies]]. A [[geophysicist]] can use mathematical modeling to infer the shape, depth and properties of the rock bodies responsible for the anomalies.

Airplanes are normally used for high-level reconnaissance surveys in gentle terrain, and helicopters are used in mountainous terrain or where more detail is required.

== Uses ==
[[File:Helicopter magnetometer.jpg|thumb|This helicopter is equipped with a magnetometer array. It flies six feet above ground at speeds of 30 to 40 mph.]]
Aeromagnetic surveys are widely used to aid in the production of [[Geologic map|geological maps]] and are also commonly used during [[mineral exploration]] and [[petroleum exploration]]. Some mineral deposits are associated with an increase or decrease in the abundance of magnetic minerals, and occasionally the sought after commodity may itself be magnetic (e.g. [[iron ore]] deposits), but often the elucidation of the subsurface structure of the upper crust is the most valuable contribution of the aeromagnetic data. It has also been used to find buried fault zones that are prone to damaging earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolawole|first=F.|last2=Atekwana|first2=E. A.|last3=Malloy|first3=S.|last4=Stamps|first4=D. S.|last5=Grandin|first5=R.|last6=Abdelsalam|first6=M. G.|last7=Leseane|first7=K.|last8=Shemang|first8=E.

Aeromagnetic surveys were performed in [[World War II]] to detect submarines using a [[Magnetic Anomaly Detector]] attached to an aircraft. Aeromagnetic surveys are also used to perform reconnaissance mapping of [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO).  The aircraft is typically a helicopter, as the sensors must be close to the ground (relative to mineral exploration) to be effective.  [[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetic]] methods are also used for this purpose.

The '''Araya and Paria xeric scrub''' (NT1301) is an ecoregion in Venezuela that stretches along the [[Caribbean]] coast to the west of Trinidad, and that includes [[Margarita Island]] and some smaller islands. The ecoregion includes dune herbs, dry thorn scrubs and deciduous forests. 
The mountains on [[Margarita Island]] hold montane forests similar to those in the mainland coastal range.
The beaches are used for breeding by sea turtles. 
Some endemic bird species are threatened with extinction by illegal capture for the pet trade.
Deforestation and over-grazing by goats are also problems.

==Geography==

===Location===
{{location map|Venezuela|relief=yes|lat_deg=10.544 |lon_deg=-63.258 |caption=Location in Venezuela|width=220px}}
The west of the ecoregion covers the [[Araya Peninsula]] and the coastal area around [[Cumaná]] to the south of the peninsula.
The ecoregion covers the coastal area to the east of the Araya Peninsula, and extends over parts of the [[Paria Peninsula]].{{sfn|Araya and Paria xeric scrub – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
It excludes two mountain areas of the Paria peninsula, which are in the [[Cordillera de la Costa montane forests]] ecoregion.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}
To the north it includes the [[Margarita Island|Margarita]], [[Cubagua]] and [[Coche Island|Coche]] islands in the Caribbean.
It has an area of {{convert|517,997|ha}}.{{sfn|Araya and Paria xeric scrub – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}

Parts of the coast of the mainland and [[Margarita Island]] are lined with [[Amazon-Orinoco-Southern Caribbean mangroves]].
To the south the Araya and Paria xeric scrub transitions into [[La Costa xeric shrublands]].
The most northern arm of the [[Orinoco Delta swamp forests]] reaches the ecoregion in the east.{{sfn|WildFinder – WWF}}

===Terrain===

The region is part of the [[Venezuelan Coastal Range]], formed during the [[Tertiary]] period.
The rocks are mostly [[schist]] and [[gneiss]]es, in some places underlain by [[granite]]s.
The soils are mostly [[entisol]]s and [[ultisol]]s.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

The {{convert|934|km2}} Margarita Island is {{convert|38|km}} north of the Araya Peninsula.
The larger, eastern part of the island is mountainous, with peaks that rise to the {{convert|910|m}} [[Cerro El Copey]].
The center of the island forms a coastal plain with sandy beaches and areas of dunes.
This is connected by an isthmus to the western part, the [[Macanao Peninsula]], which contains a line of mountains of which the {{convert|740|m}} [[Cerro Macanao]] is the highest.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

[[File:En la peninsula de Araya.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Araya Peninsula]]
The rocky northern coast of the Araya-Paria Peninsula extends for {{convert|370|km}} from west to east.
The west of the Araya Peninsula holds the ''Salina de Araya'', a sandy plain that is often flooded by the sea.
From here a line of hills extends to the east, with their highest point formed by the {{convert|1104|m}} Cerro San José.
East of the hills there is a region of low country that extends to the mountainous area of the Paria Peninsula.
The Araya-Paria Peninsula is joined to the mainland by the Cariaco-Yaguaraparo isthmus.
The ecoregion extends along the mainland coast over lower mountains to the Cumaná region.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

===Climate===

The climate varies considerably in different parts of the ecoregion.
The Araya Peninsula is extremely dry, with annual rainfall of {{convert|200-300|mm}}, with more rain towards the end of the year.
On the Paria Peninsula annual rainfall is {{convert|900-2000|mm}}, falling throughout the year, with less rain on the coast. 
In the coastal region from the center of the Araya-Paria Peninsula to Cumaná there are wet seasons from June to August, and around year end.
Rainfall is from {{convert|375|mm}} in the west to {{convert|900|mm}} in the east.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

At [[Carúpano]], mid-way along the Araya-Paria Peninsula the [[Köppen climate classification]] is "Aw": equatorial, winter dry.{{sfn|Araya and Paria xeric scrub – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}
At this location the mean monthly temperature varies from {{convert|24.2|C}} in January to {{convert|26.6|C}} in September.
Total annual rainfall is about {{convert|880|mm}}.
Monthly rainfall varies from {{convert|19.8|mm}} in March to {{convert|121.3|mm}} in July.{{sfn|Araya and Paria xeric scrub – Myers|loc=Climate Data}}
Margarita Island also has wet seasons from June to August, and around year end.
On Margarita Island rainfall is from {{convert|250|mm}} in the plain to {{convert|1000|mm}} in the mountains.
Temperatures average {{convert|26-27|C}}, but may be higher in the arid lowlands and lower in the mountains.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

==Ecology==

The ecoregion is in the [[Neotropical realm|neotropical]] realm, in the [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] biome.{{sfn|Araya and Paria xeric scrub – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}

===Flora===
[[File:Chacopatica.JPG|thumb|[[Chacopatica]] on the north coast of the eastern Araya Peninsula]]
Paria has a patchwork of bamboo forests and scrub.
The coast is lined with coconut palms, mangroves, fishing villages and resorts.
The interior holds scrub, deciduous thorn woods, pastures and agricultural fields.{{sfn|Araya and Paria xeric scrub – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
The coastal range of the ecoregion has areas of salt-tolerant coastal herbs, areas of coastal dune herbs, and areas of coastal dry thorn scrubs. 
Open communities of short salt-tolerant herbs are found in depressions that are often flooded by the sea, including species such as ''[[Atriplex pentandra]]'', ''[[Batis maritima]]'', ''[[Heterostachys ritteriana]]'', ''[[Sarcocornia fruticosa]]'' and ''[[Sesuvium portulacastrum]]''. 
Low open to dense communities of herb cover sandy dunes with species such as ''[[Cakile lanceolata]]'', ''[[Cyperus planifolius]]'', ''[[Euphorbia buxifolia]]'', ''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae]]'', ''[[Portulaca pilosa]]'', ''[[Scaevola plumieri]]'' and  ''[[Sporobolus virginicus]]''.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

The coastal dry thorn scrubs grow on rocky/sandy land from {{convert|50-100|m}} above the beaches, and contain open to very closed communities of {{convert|0.5-5|m}} plants such as columnar cacti and spiny shrubs armed with [[thorns, spines, and prickles]]. 
Typical plants are ''[[Prosopis]]'' and ''[[Parkinsonia]]'' species, ''[[Bourreria cumanensis]]'',  ''[[Opuntia caribaea]]'' and ''[[Stenocereus griseus]]''.
On the mainland and Paria Peninsula the low deciduous forests have middle density and well-developed understoreys.
Common species around the mainland Turimiquire massif include ''[[Bauhinia aculeata]]'', ''[[Bourreria cumanensis]]'', ''[[Bursera simaruba]]'', ''[[Pereskia guamacho]]'' and ''[[Tabebuia billbergii]]''. 
Common species on the Paria Peninsula are  ''[[Cynophalla hastata]]'', ''[[Diospyros inconstans]]'', ''[[Jacquinia revoluta]]'' and ''[[Maytenus sieberiana]]''.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

Plants of the Cerro Copey range on Margarita Island closely resemble those of the Cordillera de la Costa montane forest.
Forests from {{convert|10-25|m}} high are found between {{convert|200|m}} and {{convert|500-600|m}} above sea level.
Common species include  ''[[Aspidosperma vargasii]]'', ''[[Bursera simaruba]]'', ''[[Clusia rosea]]'', ''[[Coccoloba coronata]]'', ''[[Croton xanthochloros]]'', ''[[Machaerium robiniifolium]]'', ''[[Maytenus karstenii]]'', ''[[Neea anisophylla]]'', ''[[Tabebuia billbergii]]'', and ''[[Ximenia americana]]''.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}
Forests from {{convert|10-20|m}} grow from {{convert|500|m}} to {{convert|750-800|m}} with low-to-mid density, a thick understory and many palms and ''[[epiphyte]]''s.
Common species include ''[[Bactris setulosa]]'', ''[[Dendropanax arboreus]]'', ''[[Euterpe precatoria]]'', ''[[Guapira ofersiana]]'', ''[[Inga macrantha]]'', ''[[Margaritaria nobilis]]'', ''[[Myrcianthes compressa]]'', ''[[Nectandra coriacea]]'' and ''[[Tabebuia chrysantha]]''. 
Above {{convert|750|m}} there is montane evergreen shrub from {{convert|1-3|m}} high with low shrubby-herbaceous vegetation such as ''[[Blakea monticola]]'', ''[[Clusia flavia]]'', ''[[Clidemia hirta]]'',  ''[[Glomeropitcairnia erectiflora]]'', ''[[Macleania nitida]]'' and ''[[Myrsine guianensis]]''.
Endemic flora in the Cerro Copey range include ''[[Argythamnia erubescens]]'', ''[[Blakea monticola]]'', ''[[Clerodendrum margaritense]]'', ''[[Croton margaritensis]]'', ''[[Inga macrantha]]'' and ''[[Mikania johnstonii]]''.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

===Fauna===
[[File:Caballos 2010.jpg|thumb|Horses near [[Casanay]] ]]

The Macanao Peninsula and the westernmost part of the Araya Peninsula are important areas for threatened neotropical birds, particularly the [[yellow-shouldered amazon]] (''Amazona barbadensis''), which is in demand for the pet trade.
The subspecies Margarita [[blue-crowned parakeet]] (''Thectocercus acuticaudatus neoxena'') found in the mangroves around the La Restinga lagoon, is also threatened by pet trade.
The lagoon complex around Cumaná, the Golf of Cariaco salina and the Araya peninsula lagoons provide refuges to many species of birds. 
The Chacopata Lagoon has the largest [[pelican]] colony in Venezuela, and is used by large groups of [[flamingo]]s.
Beaches on Margarita are used for breeding by the [[loggerhead sea turtle]] (''Caretta caretta'') and [[green sea turtle]] (''Chelonia mydas'').
The north coast of the Paria Peninsula is the main nesting zone for the [[leatherback sea turtle]] (''Dermochelys coriacea'') in Venezuela.
Maragarita is home to subspecies of the [[eastern cottontail]] (''Sylvilagus floridanus margaritae'') and the Margaritan [[tufted capuchin]] (''Sapajus apella margaritae'').{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

==Status==

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] gives the ecoregion the status of "Critical/Endangered".{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}
Deforestation and exploitation of sand and gravel around streams in Macanao threatens the habitat of the Yellow-shouldered Amazon.
The capture for trade of Yellow-shouldered Amazon and blue-crowned Parakeet threaten these species with extinction.
All the dry vegetation in Araya and Macanao is at risk from overgrazing by goats.
Adventure tourists drive vehicles along the protected beaches of La Restinga National Park and destroy turtle nests.
The Cumaná lagoons are threatened by urbanization, pollution and introduction of exotic species.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

Protected areas include the [[Kronstadt Island Wildlife Sanctuary]] and the [[Mochima National Park]].{{sfn|Araya and Paria xeric scrub – Myers|loc=WWF Abstract}}
Protected areas in Margarita Island include the {{convert|7130|ha}} [[Cerro El Copey National Park]], the [[Cerro Matasiete]] and the [[Guayamurí Natural Monument]], which together cover most of the forest on the island. 
The {{convert|18862|ha}} [[Laguna de la Restinga]] National Park on the northern Macanao Peninsular protects mangroves and some adjoining arid areas.
The [[Laguna de Las Marites Natural Monument]] also protects mangroves. 
Within it is [[Las Tetas de María Guevara Monument]], which also protects some arid areas.{{sfn|Bonaccorso}}

'''Astrid-1''' and '''Astrid-2''' were two [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellites]] designed and developed by [[Swedish Space Corporation]] on behalf of the [[Swedish National Space Board]]. They were piggyback launched on a [[Cosmos-3M]] launch vehicle from [[Plesetsk]], [[Russia]]. Astrid 1 on January 24, 1995 and Astrid 2 on December 10, 1998.

== Astrid-1 ==
Sweden's first microsatellite was piggybacked with the launch of [[Tsikada]], a Russian [[navigation satellite]] and [[FAISAT]], a [[United States]] [[communications satellite]].

It carried an [[Neutral particle|Energetic Neutral Atom]] imager called PIPPI (Prelude in Planetary Particle Imaging), an [[Electron]] [[Spectrometer]] called EMIL (Electron Measurements - In-situ and Lightweight) and two [[UV]] [[Electronic imager|imager]]s called MIO (Miniature Imaging Optics), one for imaging the Earth's [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and one for observing [[Lyman series|Lyman alpha]]-emission from the Earth's [[geocorona]]. This payload, named after characters in [[Astrid Lindgren]]'s books (the idea came from a [[Russia]]n scientist &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satelliter finansierade av Rymdstyrelsen |url=http://www.rymdstyrelsen.se/sv/Sverige-i-rymden/Svenska-satelliter/ |language=Swedish |publisher=[[Swedish National Space Board]] |accessdate=2014-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714232614/http://www.rymdstyrelsen.se/sv/Sverige-i-rymden/Svenska-satelliter/ |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), was developed by the [[Swedish Institute of Space Physics]] in [[Kiruna]].

On March 1, a [[DC to DC converter]] for the scientific instruments failed, possibly due to a [[short circuit]], ending its scientific mission. However, the satellite was operated until September 27, serving as a testbed for various [[algorithm|software algorithms]] and [[store-and-forward]] communications.

The entire satellite was built in a year and the cost, including launch, was 1.4 million [[USD|U.S. dollars]].

== Astrid-2 ==

Astrid-2 was Sweden's second microsatellite and it was piggybacked with [[Nadezhda 5]], a Russian [[navigation satellite]].

Its payload, built by the [[Swedish Institute of Space Physics]] in [[Kiruna]] and [[Uppsala]] and the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] (Alfven Laboratory) in [[Stockholm]], was EMMA (Electrical and Magnetic field Monitoring of the Aurora), LINDA (Langmuir INterferometer and Density experiment for Astrid-2), MEDUSA (Miniaturized Electrostatic DUal-tophat Spherical Analyzer) and PIA (Photometers for Imaging the Aurora). It was used to explore the [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s in the upper [[ionosphere]] and to measure [[Neutral particle|neutral]] and charged particles and [[electron]] density.

{{Atmospheric sciences| atmophys=true}}
'''Atmospheric physics''' is the application of [[physics]] to the study of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model [[Earth's atmosphere]] and the atmospheres of the other [[planet]]s using [[fluid dynamics|fluid flow]] equations, [[chemistry|chemical]] models, [[radiation budget]], and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere (as well as how these tie into other systems such as the oceans). In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of [[scattering theory]], wave propagation models, [[cloud physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[spatial statistics]] which are highly mathematical and related to physics. It has close links to [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]] and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including [[remote sensing]] instruments. At the dawn of the space age and the introduction of sounding rockets, [[aeronomy]] became a subdiscipline concerning the upper layers of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important.

== Remote sensing ==
[[Image:weather radar.jpg|thumb|left|Brightness can indicate reflectivity as in this 1960 [[weather radar]] image (of [[1960 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Abby|Hurricane Abby]]). The radar's frequency, pulse form, and antenna largely determine what it can observe.]]

{{Main|Remote sensing}}
Remote sensing is the small or large-scale acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon, by the use of either recording or real-time sensing device(s) that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object (such as by way of [[aircraft]], [[spacecraft]], [[satellite]], [[buoy]], or [[ship]]). In practice, remote sensing is the stand-off collection through the use of a variety of devices for gathering information on a given object or area which gives more information than sensors at individual sites might convey.&lt;ref&gt;COMET program (1999). [http://www.comet.ucar.edu/nsflab/web/remote/121.htm Remote Sensing.] [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]. Retrieved on 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Earth observation]] or [[weather satellite]] collection platforms, ocean and atmospheric observing [[weather buoy]] platforms, monitoring of a pregnancy via [[ultrasound]], [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET), and [[space probes]] are all examples of remote sensing. In modern usage, the term generally refers to the use of imaging sensor technologies including but not limited to the use of instruments aboard aircraft and spacecraft, and is distinct from other imaging-related fields such as [[medical imaging]].

There are two kinds of remote sensing. Passive sensors detect natural radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding area being observed. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors. Examples of passive remote sensors include film [[photography]], infra-red, [[charge-coupled devices]], and [[radiometer]]s. Active collection, on the other hand, emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. [[radar]], [[lidar]], and [[SODAR]] are examples of active remote sensing techniques used in atmospheric physics where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, height, speed and direction of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009). [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=radar1 Radar.] [[American Meteorological Society]]. Retrieved on 2009-24-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote sensing makes it possible to collect data on dangerous or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing applications include monitoring [[deforestation]] in areas such as the [[Amazon Basin]], the effects of [[climate change]] on [[glacier]]s and Arctic and Antarctic regions, and [[depth sounding]] of coastal and ocean depths. Military collection during the [[cold war]] made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas. Remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground, ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.

Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as [[El Niño]] and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the [[earth science]]s such as [[natural resource management]], agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation, and national security and overhead, ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA]] (2009).

== Radiation ==
[[Image:seasons.svg|frame|right|This is a diagram of the seasons.  In addition to the density of incident light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]
{{see also|Radiation|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
Atmospheric physicists typically divide radiation into solar radiation (emitted by the sun) and terrestrial radiation (emitted by Earth's surface and atmosphere). 

Solar radiation contains variety of wavelengths. Visible light has wavelengths between 0.4 and 0.7&amp;nbsp;micrometers.&lt;ref&gt;Atmospheric Science Data Center. [http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html What Wavelength Goes With a Color?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105431/http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html |date=2011-07-20 }} Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter wavelengths are known as the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) part of the spectrum, while longer wavelengths are grouped into the [[infrared]] portion of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Windows to the Universe.

This increases the temperature of the nearby [[stratosphere]]. Snow reflects 88% of UV rays,&lt;ref name="UDE"/&gt; while sand reflects 12%, and water reflects only 4% of incoming UV radiation.&lt;ref name="UDE"/&gt; The more glancing the angle is between the atmosphere and the [[sun]]'s rays, the more likely that energy will be reflected or absorbed by the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeling Jesuit University. [http://www.cet.edu/ete/modules/ozone/ozatmo.html Exploring the Environment:  UV Menace.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830094306/http://www.cet.edu/ete/modules/ozone/ozatmo.html |date=August 30, 2007 }} Retrieved on 2007-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrestrial radiation is emitted at much longer wavelengths than solar radiation. This is because Earth is much colder than the sun.   Radiation is emitted by Earth across a range of wavelengths, as formalized in [[Planck's law]]. The wavelength of maximum energy is around 10 micrometers.

== Cloud physics ==
{{Main|Cloud physics}}
Cloud physics is the study of the physical processes that lead to the formation, growth and precipitation of [[cloud]]s. Clouds are composed of microscopic droplets of water (warm clouds), tiny crystals of ice, or both (mixed phase clouds). Under suitable conditions, the droplets combine to form [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], where they may fall to the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma Weather Modification Demonstration Program. [http://www.evac.ou.edu/okwmdp/physics.html CLOUD PHYSICS.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723154301/http://www.evac.ou.edu/okwmdp/physics.html |date=2008-07-23 }} Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise mechanics of how a cloud forms and grows is not completely understood, but scientists have developed theories explaining the structure of clouds by studying the microphysics of individual droplets. Advances in radar and satellite technology have also allowed the precise study of clouds on a large scale.

== Atmospheric electricity ==
[[Image:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumb|right|Cloud to ground [[Lightning]] in the global atmospheric electrical circuit.]]

Atmospheric electricity is the term given to the electrostatics and electrodynamics of the atmosphere (or, more broadly, the atmosphere of any [[planet]]).

== Atmospheric tide ==
{{Main|Atmospheric tide}}
The largest-amplitude atmospheric tides are mostly generated in the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]] when the atmosphere is periodically heated as water vapour and ozone absorb solar radiation during the day. The tides generated are then able to propagate away from these source regions and ascend into the [[mesosphere]] and [[thermosphere]]. Atmospheric tides can be measured as regular fluctuations in wind, temperature, density and pressure. Although atmospheric tides share much in common with ocean tides they have two key distinguishing features:

i) Atmospheric tides are primarily excited by the Sun's heating of the atmosphere whereas ocean tides are primarily excited by the Moon's gravitational field. This means that most atmospheric tides have periods of oscillation related to the 24-hour length of the solar day whereas ocean tides have longer periods of oscillation related to the lunar day (time between successive lunar transits) of about 24 hours 51 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=atmospheric-tide1 Atmospheric Tide.] Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

ii) Atmospheric tides propagate in an atmosphere where density varies significantly with height. A consequence of this is that their amplitudes naturally increase exponentially as the tide ascends into progressively more rarefied regions of the atmosphere (for an explanation of this phenomenon, see below). In contrast, the density of the oceans varies only slightly with depth and so there the tides do not necessarily vary in amplitude with depth.

Note that although solar heating is responsible for the largest-amplitude atmospheric tides, the gravitational fields of the Sun and Moon also raise tides in the atmosphere, with the lunar gravitational atmospheric tidal effect being significantly greater than its solar counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American. [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=does-the-moon-have-a-tida Does the Moon have a tidal effect on the atmosphere as well as the oceans?.] Retrieved on 2008-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

At ground level, atmospheric tides can be detected as regular but small oscillations in surface pressure with periods of 24 and 12 hours.  Daily pressure maxima occur at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, while minima occur at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. local time.  The absolute maximum occurs at 10 a.m. while the absolute minimum occurs at 4 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Dr James B. Calvert. [http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/geol/tides.htm Tidal Observations.] Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at greater heights the amplitudes of the tides can become very large. In the [[mesosphere]] (heights of ~ 50 – 100&amp;nbsp;km) atmospheric tides can reach amplitudes of more than 50&amp;nbsp;m/s and are often the most significant part of the motion of the atmosphere.

== Aeronomy ==
{{Main|Aeronomy}}
[[Image:Upperatmoslight1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Representation of upper-atmospheric lightning and electrical-discharge phenomena]]
Aeronomy is the science of the upper region of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. The term aeronomy was introduced by Sydney Chapman in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew F. Nagy, p. 1-2 in ''Comparative Aeronomy'', ed. by Andrew F. Nagy ''et al.'' (Springer 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-387-87824-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term also includes the science of the corresponding regions of the atmospheres of other planets.  Research in aeronomy requires access to balloons, satellites, and [[sounding rockets]] which provide valuable data about this region of the atmosphere.  [[Atmospheric tide]]s play an important role in interacting with both the lower and upper atmosphere.  Amongst the phenomena studied are [[upper-atmospheric lightning]] discharges, such as luminous events called red [[sprites (lightning)|sprites]], sprite halos, blue jets, and elves.

== Centers of research ==
In the UK, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the [[Met Office]], the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] and the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]]. Divisions of the U.S. [[NOAA|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] oversee research projects and [[weather]] modeling involving atmospheric physics. The US [[Arecibo Observatory|National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center]] also carries out studies of the high atmosphere. In [[Belgium]], the [[Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]] studies the atmosphere and [[outer space]].

The '''Krâvanh Mountains''', literally the "'''[[Cardamom]] Mountains'''" ({{lang-km|ជួរភ្នំក្រវាញ}}, ''Chuor Phnom Krâvanh''; {{lang-th|ทิวเขาบรรทัด}}, ''Thio Khao Banthat'', {{IPA-th|tʰīw kʰǎw bān.tʰát|pron}}), is a mountain range in the south west of [[Cambodia]] and [[Eastern Thailand]].

The silhouette of the Cardamom Mountains appears in the [[Seals of the provinces of Thailand|provincial seal]] of [[Trat Province]] in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2547/E/129/001.PDF Seals of The Provinces of Thailand]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and description==

The mountain range extends along a southeast-northwest axis from [[Koh Kong Province]] on the [[Gulf of Thailand]] to the [[Veal Veang District]] in [[Pursat Province]], and is extended to the southeast by the [[Dâmrei Mountains|Dâmrei (Elephant) Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.org/projects/gms-biodiversity/cardamom.asp Cardamom and Elephant Mountains (Cambodia)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050224/http://www2.adb.org/projects/gms-biodiversity/cardamom.asp |date=2012-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The northwestern end of the range in Chanthaburi Province, Thailand, appears also as the 'Soi Dao Mountains' (''Khao Soi Dao'') and as 'Chanthaburi Range' in some maps.

Dense tropical [[rainforest]] prevails on the wet western slopes which annually receive from 150 to 200&amp;nbsp;inches (3,800–5,000&amp;nbsp;mm) of rainfall. By contrast, only 40 to 60&amp;nbsp;inches (1,000 to 1,500&amp;nbsp;mm) fall in places like [[Kirirom National Park]] on the wooded eastern slopes in the [[rain shadow]] facing the interior Cambodian plain. On the eastern slopes, [[cardamom]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] are still grown commercially.

===Summits===
The highest elevation of the Cardamom Mountains is [[Phnom Aural]] in the northeast at {{convert|1813|m|ft|0}}. This is also Cambodia's highest peak. [[Phnom Samkos]] (1,717 m), [[Phnom Tumpor]] (1,516 m) and [[Phnom Kmoch]] (1,220 m) are other important summits.

==History==
The mountains contain many historic sites from the 15th- to 17th-century, containing 60&amp;nbsp;cm exotic ceramic jars and rough-hewn log coffins set out on remote, natural rock ledges, scattered around the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arts.anu.edu.au/arcworld/ippa/ABSTRACTS%20A-E.htm# |title=ANU - Ceramic Jars |access-date=2011-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317213139/http://arts.anu.edu.au/arcworld/ippa/ABSTRACTS%20A-E.htm# |archive-date=2012-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jar burials are a unique feature of this region, and forms a previously unrecorded burial practice in Khmer cultural history. Local [[legend]]s suggest the bones are the remains of Cambodian royalty.

This largely inaccessible mountainrange formed one of the last strongholds of the [[Khmer Rouge]], driven out by [[People's Army of Vietnam|Vietnamese forces]] during the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]]. The Thai border to the west, acted as a conduit for Chinese support and, eventually, a sanctuary for fleeing Khmer fighters and refugees.&lt;ref name="Terry2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fiona Terry|title=Condemned to Repeat?: The Paradox of Humanitarian Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8RB_004-1IYC&amp;pg=PA118|date=12 April 2013|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-6863-9|pages=118–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaccessibility of the hills has also helped to preserve the [[primeval forest]] and [[ecosystem]]s of the area relative intact. In 2002, however, a transborder highway to Thailand was completed south of the Cardamoms, along the coast. The highway has [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] for large mammals such as elephants, big cats and monkeys. The highway has also opened up for agricultural slash-and-burn projects and opportunistic poaching for endangered animals, all degrading the natural value and the forests ecosystems.&lt;ref name=SCNP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wildlifealliance.org/southern-cardamom-forest-registered-national-park/|title=Southern Cardamom Forest Registered as a National Park!|publisher=[[Wildlife Alliance]]|date=18 May 2016|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism is relatively new to the Cardamom Mountains. In 2008, [[Wildlife Alliance]] launched a community-based [[ecotourism]] program in the village of [[Chi-Phat]], marketed as the "gateway to the Cardamoms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/cambodia/south-coast/chi-phat Lonely Planet Chi Phat]&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist visitors to Chi-Phat continue to grow and the community is regarded as a model for community-based ecotourism, with approximately 3,000 annual visitors generating more than $US 150,000 for the local community.&lt;ref&gt;Reimer, J.

These relatively isolated mountains now form an important [[tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]], the Cardamom Mountains Moist Forests Ecoregion.&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt; One of the largest and still mostly unexplored forests in southeast Asia, it is separated from other rainforests in the region by the large [[Khorat Plateau]] to the north. The [[Vietnam]]ese [[Phú Quốc]] island off the coast of Cambodia has similar vegetation and is included in the ecoregion.&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Cardamom Mountains Moist Forests|id=im0106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the region is covered in evergreen rain forest with a different type of thick evergreens above 700m and areas of dwarf conifer ''[[Dacrydium elatum]]'' forest on the southern slopes of the Elephant Mountains and an area of [[Tenasserim pine]] dominated forest on the Kirirom plateau. ''[[Hopea pierrei]]'', an [[endangered]] canopy tree rare  elsewhere, is relatively abundant in the Cardamom Mountains. Other [[angiosperm]] tree species are ''[[Anisoptera costata]]'', ''[[Anisoptera glabra]]'', ''[[Dipterocarpus costatus]]'', ''[[Hopea odorata]]'', ''[[Shorea hypochra]]'', ''[[Caryota urens]]'' and ''[[Oncosperma tigillarium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/cardamom_moist_forests.cfm# |title=World Wildlife Fund - Cardamom Mountains Moist Forests |access-date=2012-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517064114/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/cardamom_moist_forests.cfm# |archive-date=2015-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Pinophyta|conifers]] include ''[[Pinus kesiya]]'', ''[[Dacrycarpus imbricatus]]'', ''[[Podocarpus neriifolius]]'', ''[[Podocarpus pilgeri|P. pilgeri]]'' and ''[[Nageia wallichiana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/genetics-and-conservation/international-conifer-conservation-programme/conifers-of-cambodia-lao-pdr-and-vietnam |title=Conifers of Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam |year=2010 |work=Science/Genetics &amp; Conservation/Conifer Conservation |publisher=Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129234736/http://www.rbge.org.uk/science/genetics-and-conservation/international-conifer-conservation-programme/conifers-of-cambodia-lao-pdr-and-vietnam |archivedate=29 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The southernmost on [[Earth]] natural habitats of genus ''[[Betula]]'' (species ''[[Betula alnoides]]'') are situated in the northern part of Cardamom Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herba.msu.ru/russian/journals/bmsn/117/117_5.pdf Forest Vegetation of Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia.

===Fauna===
[[Image:Indochinese Tiger.jpg|thumb|[[Indochinese tiger]]]]
The moist climate and undisturbed nature of the rocky mountainsides appears to have allowed a rich variety of wildlife to thrive, although the Cardamom and Elephant Mountains are poorly researched and the wildlife that is assumed to be here remains to be catalogued. They are thought to be home to over 100 mammals such as the [[large Indian civet]] and [[banteng]] cattle, and most importantly the mountains are thought to shelter at least 62 globally threatened animal species and 17 globally threatened trees, many of them endemic to Cambodia.&lt;ref name=geckoBBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8584000/8584979.stm BBC News, "New cryptic gecko species is discovered in Cambodia ", 24 March 2010]: accessed 24 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the animals are fourteen endangered and threatened mammal species, including the largest population of [[Asian elephant]] in Cambodia and possibly the whole of Indochina although this still needs to be proved. Other mammals, many of which are threatened, include [[Indochinese tiger]], [[clouded leopard]] (''Pardofelis nebulosa''), [[dhole]] (a wild dog) (''Cuon alpinus''), [[gaur]] (''Bos gaurus''), banteng (''Bos javanicus''), the disputed [[kting voar]] (''Pseudonovibos spiralis''), [[Malayan sun bear]], [[pileated gibbon]] (''Hylobates pileatus''), [[Sumatran serow]] (''Capricornis sumatraensis''), [[Sunda pangolin]] and the [[Tenasserim white-bellied rat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceropath.org/rdbsea/species/niviventer%20tenaster CeroPath - ''Niviventer tenaster'' Thomas, 1916]&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least 34 species of [[amphibian]]s, three of them described as new species to science from here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ohler |first1=A. |author2=S.

The rivers are home to both [[Irrawaddy dolphin|Irrawaddy]] and [[humpback dolphin]]s and are home to some of the last populations on Earth of the very rare [[Siamese crocodile]]s and the only nearly extinct [[northern river terrapin]], or ''royal turtle'' remaining in Cambodia. While the forests are habitat for more than 450 bird species, half of Cambodia’s total of which four, the [[chestnut-headed partridge]], Lewis's silver pheasant (''[[Lophura nycthemera]] lewisi''), the [[green peafowl]] (''Pavo muticus'') and the [[Siamese partridge]] (''Arborophila diversa'') are endemic to these mountains. A reptile and amphibian survey led in June 2007 by Dr Lee Grismer of [[La Sierra University]] in Riverside, California, US and the conservation organisation [[Fauna and Flora International]] uncovered new species, such as a new ''[[Cnemaspis]]'' gecko, ''C.  neangthyi''.&lt;ref name=geckoBBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grismer | first1 = J.

===Protected areas===
The human population of the Cardamom Mountain Range although very small is extremely poor.  Threats to the biological diversity of the region include [[habitat loss]] due to [[illegal logging]], wildlife [[poaching]], and [[forest fires]] caused by [[slash-and-burn agriculture]]. While the Cambodian forests in the Cardamom Mountains are fairly intact,{{cn|reason=needs an update|date=November 2016}} the section in Thailand has been badly affected.

About a third of the ecoregion has been designated as [[protected area]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mekong-protected-areas.org/cambodia/pa-map.htm Protected areas in Cambodia]&lt;/ref&gt; but the level of active protection in all parks in the mountains has been criticised.{{by who|date=August 2018}}{{explain|reason=What was the criticism about?|date=August 2018}}{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Tourism==
The Cardamom Mountains are an emerging tourist destination.

The village of Chi Phat runs a Community-Based Eco-Tourism project with the support of conservation NGO, [[Wildlife Alliance]]. Previously a logging and hunting community, villagers now make sustainable income through homestays, multiple day guided treks to natural and cultural sites, mountain bike, boat and bird watching tours.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The Wildlife Release Station in [[Koh Kong Province]] is a release site for animals rescued from the illegal wildlife trade in Cambodia by the NGO Wildlife Alliance. Binturong, porcupine, pangolins, civets, macaques and an array of birds are among the many species that have been released on site. The station was opened to tourists in December 2013, offering guests an insight into the workings of a wildlife rehabilitation and release site while staying in jungle chalets and enjoying Cambodian hospitality. Activities offered can include feeding resident wildlife, jungle hiking, radio tracking and setting camera traps to monitor released wildlife.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Wild Animal Rescue (WAR Adventures Cambodia) also organize a wide range of deep jungle activities from the family trekking to the hardcore RAID adventure, jungle orientation and survival training course, even animals and human tracking course, all in the region of Sre Ambel in the South-west of the Cardamom mountains.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}
'''Contained earth''' (CE) is a structurally designed [[natural building material]] that combines containment, inexpensive reinforcement, and strongly cohesive [[earthen wall]]s. CE is [[earthbag construction]] that can be calibrated for several [[seismic risk]] levels based on building soil strength and plan standards for adequate bracing.

There is a recognized need for structural understanding of alternative building materials.&lt;ref&gt; Schildkamp, Martijn (2015) Outcome of Survey About Simplified Earthquake Research. SmartShelterResearch.com, 74% of almost 90 professional respondents to a 2015 survey expressed a need for structural information about alternative building materials&lt;/ref&gt; Construction guidelines for CE are currently under development, based on the New Zealand's performance-based code for adobe and rammed earth.&lt;ref&gt; Standards New Zealand (1998) 4299: Earth Buildings Not Requiring Specific Design&lt;/ref&gt; 

CE is differentiated from [[contained gravel]] (CG) or [[contained sand]] (CS) by the use of damp, tamped, cured cohesive fill. CE can be modular, built in [[poly-propylene]] [[rice bag]] material containers, or solid, built in mesh tubing that allows earthen fill to solidify between courses. 
[[File:Types of Contained Earth.jpg|thumb|Types of Contained Earth]]

CG, filled with [[pumice]] or ordinary [[gravel]] and/ or small stones, is often used as water-resistant base walls under CE, which also provides an effective [[capillary break]]. Soilbags used mostly in horizontal applications by [[civil engineer]]s contain loose fill which includes both CG and CS. CG courses, like soilbags, may contribute base isolation and/or vibration damping qualities,&lt;ref&gt; Liu, Sihong, Y. Wang, J. Gao, and Y. Jin (2011) [http:www.scientific.net/AMR.243-249.893 Cyclic Simple Shear Tests on Base Isolation Using Soilbags] Advanced Materials Research Vols. 243–249 pp 893–896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Yamamoto, Haruyuki and H. Cheng (2012) "Development Study on Device To Reduce Seismic Response by Using Soil-bags Assemblies," in Research, Development, and Practice in Structural Engineering and Construction, V. Singh and A. Yazdani (eds.), ASEA-Sec-1, Perth, 28 November – 2 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; although out-of-plane strength needs research. 

For clarity, earthbag built with a low cohesion fill, or filled with dry soil that does not solidify, is not CE but CS. Uncured CE also performs structurally like CS.

==Earthbag variations==
Builders used to working without engineers are proud of earthbag's unlimited variations. Few trainers discuss risk levels of building sites, or recommend accurate tests of soil strength, even though soil strength is a key factor of improved seismic performance for earthen walls.&lt;ref&gt; King, Bruce (2008) The Renaissance of Earthen Architecture&lt;/ref&gt; 

Need for or use of metal components are disputed, including [[rebar]] hammered into walls&lt;ref&gt; Geiger, Owen (2011) Earthbag Building Guide: Vertical Walls Step-by-Step (ebook)&lt;/ref&gt; and barbed wire between courses, although static friction of smooth bag-to-bag surfaces of heavy modular CE walls is 0.4 with no adhesion.&lt;ref&gt; Pelly, Ralph (2009) Plastic Limit Analysis of Earthbag Structures. University of Bath (dissertation) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;   

Engineering knowledge of earthbag has been growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthbagbuilding.com/testing.htm Earthbag Testing Research Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; More is known about the performance of walls made with sand or dry or uncured soil than about the overwhelming majority of earthbag buildings which have used damp, cohesive soil fill. Reports based on tests of soilbags and loose or granular fill (or uncured fill) assumes that soil strength is less important to wall strength than bag fabric strength for.&lt;ref&gt; Canadell, Samuel, A. Blanco and S. Cavalero (2016) Comprehensive Design Method for Earthbag and Superadobe. Materials and Design 96 (2016) 270- 282&lt;/ref&gt; However, shear tests show clearly that stronger cured, cohesive fill increases contained earth wall strength substantially.&lt;ref&gt; Stouter, P. (May 2017) [https://buildsimple.org/resources/Estimated%20Shear%20Strengths%20CE%205-25-17.pdf Estimated Shear Strengths of Contained Earth Walls]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthbag for high risk environments==
Earthbag developed gradually without structural analysis, first for small domes,&lt;ref&gt; Hart, K. [http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/history.htm History] EarthbagBuilding.com&lt;/ref&gt; then for vertical wall buildings of many shapes. Although domes passed structural testing in California, no structural information was extracted from tests of the inherently stable shapes.&lt;ref&gt; Khalili and Vittori&lt;/ref&gt; Builders borrowed guidelines for adobe to recommend plan details,&lt;ref&gt; Hunter, K. and D. Kiffmeyer (2004) Earthbag Building: Tools, Tricks and Techniques. New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island Canada&lt;/ref&gt; but code developed in low seismic risk New Mexico does not address issues for higher risk areas.&lt;ref&gt; New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department (2015)
[http://164.64.110.239/nmac/parts/title14/14.007.0004.htm 2015 New Mexico Earthen Building Code]&lt;/ref&gt; California's seismic risk levels are almost three times as high as New Mexico's,&lt;ref&gt; USGS (2014) [ftp://hazards.cr.usgs.gov/web/nshm/conterminous/2014/2014_5Hz2pct.pdf Seismicity: Conterminous US 2% probability in 50 years map of 0.2 second spectral acceleration]&lt;/ref&gt; and risk worldwide rises much higher. 

Earthbag is often tried after disasters in the developing world, including Sri Lanka's [[2004 tsunami]]&lt;ref&gt;Earthbag housing: structural behaviour and applicability in Sri Lanka. Engineering Sustainability [serial online]. December 2011;164(4):261–273. Available from: Academic Search Premier, Ipswich, MA. Accessed 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;, Haiti's [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/projects/haiti.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Nepal's [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|2015 earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt; Nepal Earthquake Clearinghouse (2015) [http://www.eqclearinghouse.org/2015-04-25-nepal/2015/06/08/performance-of-earthbag-schools/ Performance of Earthbag Schools]. Earthquake Engineering Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; 

CE walls fail in [[shear test]]s when barbs flex or bend back or (with weak soil fill) by chipping cured bag fill. CS walls or uncured CE walls fail differently, by slitting bag fabric as barbs move through loose fill.

Because no earthbag buildings were seriously damaged by seismic motion up to 0.8 g in [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal's 2015 quakes]], [[Nepal's building code]] recognizes earthbag,&lt;ref&gt; Geiger,
 O. (7 April 2017) [http://www.naturalbuildingblog.com/earthbag-building-gains-code-approval-nepal/ Earthbag Building Gains Code Approval in Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; although the code does not discuss soil strengths or improved reinforcement. Nepal requires buildings to resist 1.5 g risk although hazard maps show higher values. Better trainers assume the use of cohesive soil and barbed wire, and recommend vertical rebar, buttresses, and bond beams,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.goodearthnepal.org/earthbag-technology/ Earthbag Technology] (website)&lt;/ref&gt; but rule of thumb earthbag techniques should be differentiated from contained earth that follows more complete guidelines.

==CE compared to New Zealand wall strengths==
Earthquake damage results confirm the validity of New Zealand's detailed standards for non-engineered adobe and rammed earth&lt;ref&gt; Morris, Hugh, R. Walker and T. Drupsteen (2011) [https://www.nzsee.org.nz/db/2011/133.pdf Modern and historic earth buildings: Observations of the 4th September 2010 Darfield Earthquake] Proceedings of the Ninth Pacific Conference on Earthquake Engineering,
14- 16 April 2011, Auckland, NZ&lt;/ref&gt; which allow unreinforced buildings to 0.6 g force levels.

Although earthbag without specific guidelines may often be this strong, conventional [[adobe]] can have severe damage at levels below 0.2 g forces.&lt;ref&gt; Tarque Ruiz, Sabino (2008) [http://www.roseschool.it/files/get/id/4480 Seismic Risk Assessment of Adobe Dwellings] University of Pavia (dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; Non-traditional earthbag built with barbed wire, barely cohesive soil and no rebar can have half the shear strength of NZ's unreinforced adobe.&lt;ref&gt; Stouter, P. (2016) Structural Information for Earthbag/ Contained Earth Walls. Build Simple Inc. www.BuildSimple.org&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhere between 0.3 and 0.6 g forces, CE guidelines become important.

Based on static shear testing (Stouter, P. May 2017):
The following approximate guidelines assume a single story of {{Convert|380|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide walls with 2 strands of 4 point [[barbed wire]] per course. Check NZS 4299 for bracing wall spacing and size of bracing walls and/ or buttresses. Vertical rebar must be spaced {{Convert|1.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} on center average and embedded in wall fill while damp. Follow NZS 4299 restrictions on building size, site slope, climate, and uses.
Discuss foundation concerns with an engineer, since NZS 4299 assumes a full reinforced concrete footing.

For comparison to NZS 4299 the following risk levels are based roughly on 0.2 second spectral acceleration (Ss) from 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years. Builders may refer to the Unified Facilities Handbook online&lt;ref&gt; US Army Core of Engineers, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and Air Force Engineer Center. (2012) [https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/dod/unified-facilities-criteria-ufc/ufc-3-301-01 Unified Facilities Criteria: Structural Engineering]. pp. 134- 158&lt;/ref&gt; for these values for some cities worldwide. These risk levels are based on ultimate strength, but deformation limits may require stiffer detailing or lower risk levels.
[[File:Seismic Risk Levels- Eastern Hemisphere.jpg|thumb|Seismic Risk Levels- Eastern Hemisphere]]
[[File:Seismic Risk Levels-Western hemisphere.jpg|thumb|Seismic Risk Levels-Western hemisphere]]

Medium strength soil: {{Convert|250|psi|MPa|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} unconfined compressive strength
* ±0.75 g risk if 2 separate pieces of rebar are inserted, overlapped
* 1.6 g risk if an entire internal rebar extends from base to bond beam

Strong soil: {{Convert|2.2|MPa|psi|0|abbr=on}} unconfined compressive strength
* ±1.6 g risk if 2 separate pieces of rebar are inserted, overlapped
* ±2.1 g risk if a single rebar extends from base to bond beam

Additional research and engineering analysis is needed to create valid CE manuals.

[[File:Hubbert peak oil plot.svg|thumb|A 1956 world oil production distribution, showing historical data and future production, proposed by [[M. King Hubbert]]; it has a peak of 12.5 billion barrels per year in 
about the year 2000]]
'''Energy descent''' is the post-[[peak oil]] transitional phase, when humankind is predicted to move from the ascending use of energy that has occurred since the [[industrial revolution]] to a descending use of energy.

==Summary==
Energy descent refers to retraction of oil use after the [[peak oil]] availability. Planning and preparing for this [[peak oil]] energy descent period has been recently promoted by [[David Holmgren]], [[Rob Hopkins]] of the [[Transition Towns]] movement, and [[Richard Heinberg]] in the 2004 book ''[[Power Down: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World|Power down]]''.

That oil reserves are dwindling is now becoming acknowledged more widely, especially after the International Energy Agency released the 2008 World Energy Outlook report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/ 2008 World Energy Outlook]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2007 and 2008 the IEA changed its figures for projected rate of decline in world energy supply from 3.7% a year (2007) to a projected rate of decline of 6.7% a year (2008) leading to a peak in oil supplies in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/15/oil-peak-energy-iea | author = [[George Monbiot]] | title = When will the oil run out? | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | date = December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 several major companies including Arup, Yahoo, and Virgin created the UK Industry Taskforce on Peak Oil and Energy Security (ITPOES) and released a report, ''The Oil Crunch'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.peakoil.net/publications/the-oil-crunch | title = The Oil Crunch | date = October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which calls for 'collaborative contingency planning' by government and industry in the face of dwindling oil reserves.

An Energy Descent Action Plan (EDAP) is a local plan for planning and preparing for energy descent. It goes well beyond issues of energy supply, to look at across-the-board creative adaptations in the realms of health, education, economy and much more. Energy Descent Planning is a process developed by the Transition Towns Movement.

== Criticism ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Some techno-optimists, such as [[Julian Lincoln Simon|Julian Simon]], have disputed energy projections such as this, arguing that as oil becomes more expensive, humanity will tend to diversify its energy sources away from a reliance on oil, thus avoiding undesired global reductions in energy usage.

The '''Flin Flon greenstone belt''', also referred to as the '''Flin Flon – Snow Lake greenstone belt''', is a [[Precambrian]] [[greenstone belt]] located in the central area of [[Manitoba]] and east-central [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]] (near [[Flin Flon]]).

The belt is bounded by metasedimentary [[gneisses]] and metavolcanics of the Kisseynew Domain to the north and extends to the south where it is unconformably overlain by [[Ordovician]] age [[dolomite]].

==Economic geology==
"The Flin Flon – Snow Lake belt is one of the most prolific mining belts in the world. A multitude of base and precious metal deposits of various sizes have been found in this relatively small area, some 250 km long and 45 km wide. There have been 25 operating mines in this area starting with the Mandy Mine,
which first went into production in 1916. Most of these mines produce copper–zinc and associated precious metals, although at least three produced principally gold and silver."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/mit/tspd/pdf/studies/pukatawagan.pdf|publisher=Transportation and Government Service, Government of Manitoba|title=All-Weather Road to Pukatawagan Economic Assessment Study|date=August 2001|work=Dillon Consulting Limited/  Westdal &amp; Associates|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Sound Forest''' lies near the southern coast of the East End distinct of [[Grand Cayman]], one of the [[Cayman Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It is one of the territory’s [[Important Bird Area]]s (IBAs).

==Description==
Frank Sound Forest is a 223&amp;nbsp;ha tract of native [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forest]] surrounding [[Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park]]. it is privately owned, unprotected and is subject to fragmentation and [[deforestation|clearance]] for agricultural and urban development.&lt;ref name=bli/&gt;

===Birds===
The IBA was identified as such by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports populations of [[Cuban amazon]]s, [[Caribbean elaenia]]s, [[thick-billed vireo]]s, [[Yucatan vireo]]s and [[vitelline warbler]]s.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org |title=Frank Sound Forest |accessdate=2014-04-02 |work=Important Bird Areas factsheet |first= |last= |publisher=BirdLife International |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QE8rvIqH?url=http://www.birdlife.org/ |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hellfire Corner''' was a junction in the [[Ypres Salient]] in the [[First World War]]. The main supplies for the British Army in this sector passed along the road from [[Ypres]] to [[Menen|Menin]] - the famous [[Menin Road]]. A section of the road was where the [[Sint-Jan]]-[[Zillebeke]] road and the Ypres-[[Roulers]] railway line crossed the road. The German Army positions overlooked this spot and their guns were [[gun laying|registered]] upon it so that movement through this junction was perilous, making it the most dangerous place in the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=World War I: The Western Front |page=165 |isbn=0517053209 |author=Peter Simkins |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These '''historical impacts of climate change''' can improve human life and cause societies to flourish, or can be instrumental in civilization's [[societal collapse]].

==Role in human evolution==
Changes in East African climate have been associated with the evolution of [[hominini]]. Researchers have proposed that the regional environment transitioned from humid [[jungle]] to more [[arid]] grasslands due to [[tectonic uplift]]&lt;ref name="Tectonics"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/GSAT01709A.1|title=Blue Nile incision on the Ethiopian Plateau: Pulsed plateau growth, Pliocene uplift, and hominin evolution|year=2007|author=Gani, Nahid DS|journal=GSA Today|volume=17|pages=4|last2=Gani|first2=M.

Some data suggest that this environmental change caused the development of modern homimin features; however there exist other data that show that [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] changes in the earliest hominins occurred while the region was still forested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-540-32474-4|author=Winfried Henke, Ian Tattersall (eds.); in collaboration with Thorolf Hardt.|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|title=Handbook of paleoanthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid [[tectonic uplift]] likely occurred in the early [[Pleistocene]],&lt;ref name="East Africa climate"/&gt; changing the local elevation and broadly reorganizing the regional patterns of atmospheric circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1129158|date=Sep 2006|title=Tectonic uplift and Eastern Africa aridification|volume=313|issue=5792|pages=1419–23|issn=0036-8075|pmid=16960002|journal=Science|author1=Sepulchre, P|author2=Ramstein, G|author3=Fluteau, F|author4=Schuster, M|author5=Tiercelin, Jj|author6=Brunet, M|bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1419S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.06.005|date=Nov 2007|title=Tectonics, orbital forcing, global climate change, and human evolution in Africa: introduction to the African paleoclimate special volume|volume=53|issue=5|pages=443–64|issn=0047-2484|pmid=17915289|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|author1=Maslin, Ma|author2=Christensen, B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be correlated with the rapid hominin evolution of the [[Quaternary period]].&lt;ref name="Tectonics"/&gt; Changes in climate at 2.8, 1.7, and 1.0 million years ago correlate well with observed transitions between recognized hominin species.&lt;ref name="East Africa climate"/&gt; It is difficult to differentiate correlation from causality in these [[paleoanthropology|paleopanthropological]] and [[paleoclimatology|paleoclimatological]] reconstructions, so these results must be interpreted with caution and related to the appropriate time-scales and uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1116051|date=Jan 2006|author=Behrensmeyer, Ak|title=Atmosphere.

== Role in human migration and agriculture ==
Climate change has been linked to human migration from as early as the end of the [[Pleistocene]] to the early twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv513bpq|title=From Foraging to Agriculture: The Levant at the End of the Ice Age|last=HENRY|first=DONALD O.|date=1989|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=|isbn=9780812281378|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp6qz|title=An Introduction to International Migration Studies: European Perspectives|date=2012|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789089644565|editor-last=Martiniello|editor-first=Marco|editor-last2=Rath|editor-first2=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of climate on available resources and living conditions such as food, water, and temperature drove the movement of populations and determined the ability for groups to begin a system of [[agriculture]] or continue a foraging lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Groups such as the inhabitants of northern Peru and central Chile,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dillehay|first=Tom D.|date=2002|title=Climate and Human Migrations|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3832641|journal=Science|volume=298|issue=5594|pages=764–765}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Saqqaq culture|Saqqaq]] in Greenland,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Andrea|first=William J.|last2=Huang|first2=Yongsong|last3=Fritz|first3=Sherilyn C.|last4=Anderson|first4=N.

=== Further descriptions of specific cases: ===
In northern Peru and central Chile climate change is cited as the driving force in a series of migration patterns from about 15,000 B.C. to approximately 4,500 B.C. Between 11,800 B.C. and 10,500 B.C. evidence suggests seasonal migration from high to low elevation by the natives while conditions permitted a humid environment to persist in both areas. Around 9,000 B.C. the lakes that periodically served as a home to the natives dried up and were abandoned until 4,500 B.C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This period of abandonment is a blank segment of the archeological record also known as the ''Silencios Arqueologico''. During this break, there exists no evidence of activity by the natives in the lakes area. The correlation between climate and migratory patterns leads historians to believe the Central Chilean natives favored humid, low-elevation areas especially during periods of increased [[Arid|aridity]]. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The different inhabitants of [[Greenland]], specifically in the west, migrated primarily in response to temperature change. The Saqqaq people arrived in Greenland around 4,500 B.C. and experienced moderate temperature variation for the first 1,100 years of occupation; near 3,400 B.C. a cooling period began that pushed the Saqqaq toward the west. A similar temperature fluctuation occurred around 2,800 B.C. that led to the abandonment of the inhabited Saqqaq region; this temperature shift was a decrease in temperature of about 4 ºC over 200 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Following the Saqqaq dominance, other groups such as the [[Dorset culture|Dorset]] people inhabited west Greenland; the Dorset were sea-ice hunters that had tools adapted to the colder environment. The Dorset appeared to leave the region around 2,200 B.C. without clear connection to the changing environment. Following the Dorset occupation, the [[Vikings|Norse]] began to appear around 1,100 B.C. in west Greenland during a significant warming period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugmore|first=Andrew J.|last2=Keller|first2=Christian|last3=McGovern|first3=Thomas H.|date=2007|title=Norse Greenland Settlement: Reflections on Climate Change, Trade, and the Contrasting Fates of Human Settlements in the North Atlantic Islands|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/383134|journal=Arctic Anthropology|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=12–36|doi=10.1353/arc.2011.0038|issn=1933-8139}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a sharp decrease in temperature beginning in 850 B.C. of about 4º C in 80 years is thought to contribute to the demise of initial Norse occupation in western Greenland.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[History of China|Historical China]] over the past 2,000 years, migration patterns have centered around precipitation change and temperature fluctuation. [[Pastoralism|Pastoralists]] moved in order to feed the livestock that they cared for and to forage for themselves in more plentiful areas.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; During dry periods or cooling periods the [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic]] lifestyle became more prevalent because pastoralists were seeking more fertile ground. The precipitation was a more defining factor than temperature in terms of its effects on migration. The trend of the migrating Chinese showed that the northern pastoralists were more affected by the fluctuation in precipitation than the southern nomads. In a majority of cases, pastoralists migrated further southward during changes in precipitation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These movements were not classified by one large event or a specific era of movement; rather, the relationship between climate and nomadic migration is relevant from "a long term perspective and on a large spatial scale."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Natufian population in the Levant was subject to two major climactic changes that influenced the development and separation of their culture.  As a consequence of increased temperature, the expansion of the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests|Mediterranean woodlands]] occurred approximately 13,000 years ago; with that expansion came a shift to sedentary foraging adopted by the surrounding population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, a migration toward the higher-elevation woodlands took place and remained constant for nearly 2,000 years. This era ended when the climate became more arid and the Mediterranean forest shrank 11,000 years ago. Upon this change, some of the Natufian populations nearest sustainable land transitioned into an agricultural way of life; sustainable land was primarily near water sources. Those groups that did not reside near a stable resource returned to the nomadic foraging that was prevalent prior to sedentary life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Historical and prehistoric societies==
The rise and fall of societies have often been linked to environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Great Warming: Climate Change and the Rise and Fall of Civilizations | publisher= New York: [[Bloomsbury Press]] | date= 2008 | isbn= 978-1-59691-392-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal growth and urbanization===
Approximately one millennium after the 7 [[Kiloannum|ka]] slowing of sea-level rise, many coastal urban centers rose to prominence around the world.&lt;ref name="day EOS"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2007EO150001|title=Emergence of Complex Societies After Sea Level Stabilized|year=2007|author=Day, John W.|journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union]]|volume=88|pages=169|last2=Gunn|first2=Joel D.|last3=Folan|first3=William J.|last4=Yáñez-Arancibia|first4=Alejandro|last5=Horton|first5=Benjamin P.|bibcode=2007EOSTr..88..169D|issue=15|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/J_Gunn_Emergence_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized that this is correlated with the development of stable coastal environments and ecosystems and an increase in marine productivity (also related to an increase in temperatures), which would provide a food source for hierarchical urban societies.&lt;ref name="day EOS"/&gt; Cultures on Great Britain progressed differently than cultures on the European mainland due to flooding of the Dover-Calais land bridge around 428,000 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/science/britain-europe-split-land-bridge.html |title= When Britain Split From Europe, in a Big Way |publisher=The New York Times|date=4 April 2017|author=Nicholas Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two proposed methods of Classic Maya collapse: environmental and non-environmental. The environmental approach uses paleoclimatic evidence to show that movements in the [[intertropical convergence zone]] likely caused severe, extended droughts during a few time periods at the end of the archaeological record for the classic Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1080444|date=Mar 2003|title=Climate and the collapse of Maya civilization|volume=299|issue=5613|pages=1731–5|issn=0036-8075|pmid=12637744|journal=Science|author1=Haug, Gh|author2=Günther, D|author3=Peterson, Lc|author4=Sigman, Dm|author5=Hughen, Ka|author6=Aeschlimann, B|bibcode = 2003Sci...299.1731H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-environmental approach suggests that the collapse could be due to increasing class tensions associated with the building of monumental architecture and the corresponding decline of agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Hosler D, Sabloff JA, Runge D |chapter=Simulation model development: a case study of the Classic Maya collapse|editor1=Hammond, Norman |editor2=Thompson, John L. |title=Social process in Maya prehistory: studies in honour of Sir Eric Thompson|publisher=Academic Press|location=Boston|year=1977|isbn=0-12-322050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Robert S.|last1=Santley|first2=Thomas W.|last2=Killion|first3=Mark T.|last3=Lycett|title=On the Maya Collapse|journal=Journal of Anthropological Research|volume=42|issue=2|pages=123–59|date=Summer 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased internal warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0956536100001735|title=Changing Ceramic Production and Exchange in the Petexbatun Region, Guatemala: Reconsidering the Classic Maya Collapse|year=1997|author=Foias, Antonia E.|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|volume=8|pages=275|last2=Bishop|first2=Ronald L.|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harappa and Indus civilizations were affected by drought 4,500–3,500 years ago. A decline in rainfall in the Middle East and Northern India 3,800–2,500 is likely to have affected the Hittites and Ancient Egypt.

==Historical era==
Notable periods of climate change in recorded history include the [[Medieval warm period]] and the [[little ice age]]. In the case of the Norse, the Medieval warm period was associated with the Norse age of exploration and Arctic colonization, and the later colder periods led to the decline of those colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Patterson | first1 = W.P. | last2 = Dietrich | first2 = K.A. | last3 = Holmden | first3 = C. | year = 2007 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.132.4973 | title = Sea Ice and sagas: stable isotope evidence for two millennia of North Atlantic seasonality on the north Icelandic shelf | conference = Arctic Natural Climate Change Workshop | location = [[Tromsø]], Norway }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''iceway''' is a linear channel eroded through bedrock by the passage of glacial ice. The term was coined by [[geographer]] Ronald Kay Gresswell in a paper in 1964 in relation to the origins of the [[Dee Estuary|Dee]] and [[Mersey Estuary|Mersey estuaries]] on the boundary of northwest [[England]] and northeast [[Wales]]. Gresswell identified several such sub-parallel features running in a northwest to southeast direction from [[Liverpool Bay]] through [[Merseyside]] into [[Cheshire]]. The Dee estuary and its landward continuation south of [[Chester]] as far as [[Farndon, Cheshire|Farndon]] along with the Mersey estuary are the two largest iceways discerned in this region. Further iceways were identified underlying the lower [[River Gowy|Gowy]] valley and the Alt-Ditton depression east of [[Liverpool]]. Each of these have also been referred to as [[tunnel valley]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R K Gresswell, 1964 Origins of the Dee and Mersey Estuaries&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">'''Janine M. Benyus''' (born 1958 in [[New Jersey]]) is an American [[natural science]]s writer, innovation consultant, and author.

==Life==
Benyus graduated [[summa cum laude]] from [[Rutgers University]] with degrees in [[natural resource management]] and [[English literature]]/[[writing]]. Benyus teaches interpretive writing, lectures at the [[University of Montana]], and works towards restoring and protecting wild lands. She serves on a number of [[land use]] committees in her rural county, and is president of Living Education, a nonprofit dedicated to place-based living and learning. Benyus lives in [[Stevensville, Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://biomimicry.net/product/janine-book/ Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired By Nature - Biomimicry 3.8] Retrieved 2017-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in biomimicry==
Benyus has authored six books on [[biomimicry]], including ''Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature''. In this book she develops the basic thesis that human beings should consciously emulate nature's genius in their designs.

In 1998, Benyus co-founded the Biomimicry Guild with Dr. Dayna Baumeister, the [[Innovation Consultancy]], which helps innovators learn from and emulate natural models in order to design [[sustainable]] products, processes, and policies that create conditions conducive to life. She is also President of [[The Biomimicry Institute]], a [[non-profit organization]] whose mission is to naturalize biomimicry in the culture by promoting the transfer of ideas, designs, and strategies from biology to sustainable human systems design.

In 2006, Benyus co-founded a non-profit organization which launched AskNature.org in 2008. In 2010, Benyus, Dayna Baumeister, Chris Allen, Bryony Schwan and their team combined the non-profit and profit parts into Biomimicry 3.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://janinebenyus.com/|title=Founders :: Biomimicry 3.8|website=janinebenyus.com|access-date=2016-09-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209160147/http://janinebenyus.com/|archivedate=2012-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of cultivars are available in a huge range of sizes, shapes and colours (other than pure blue). They are usually sold as bulbs to be planted in autumn and winter for flowering in mid- to late spring. They are frequently treated as [[bedding (horticulture)|bedding plants]], accompanied by other seasonal favourites such as [[Erysimum|wallflowers]] and [[forget-me-nots]], flowering for one season before being discarded. However, in favoured locations they can be left in the ground to re-appear the following and subsequent years. Like many other bulbous plants they require a hot, dry dormant period in the summer.&lt;ref name=RHSAZ&gt;{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1405332964|pages=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Viridiflora - flowers striped with green, or entirely green; late spring
#Rembrandt - "broken" colours (striped or feathered) caused by a virus; late spring
#Parrot - unevenly striped with irregularly cut edges; late spring
#Double late - peony-shaped fully [[double flower]]s; late spring
#Kaufmanniana - ''T. kaufmanniana'' and its hybrids, multi-coloured; early to mid-spring
#Fosteriana - ''T. fosteriana'' and its hybrids; mid-spring
#Greigii - ''T. greigii'' and its hybrids; early to mid-spring
#Miscellaneous - all species and hybrids not included elsewhere; the smaller species require sharp drainage and are best grown in an [[alpine garden]]

[[File:Risley moss nature reserve.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Bog|Mosslands]], such as [[Risley Moss]], are one of the major habitat types in Cheshire]]
There are 63 [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[Cheshire]], England, covering a total area of 19,844 hectares (49,035 acres). Of these, 51 have been designated for their [[biology|biological]] interest, 7 for their [[geology|geological]] or [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] features, and 5 for both.&lt;ref name=cheshire_list&gt;{{cite web | title=Sites of Special Scientific Interest: Cheshire | work=Natural England | url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/searchresults.cfm?sssi_name=&amp;frmcounty=1006 | accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSSIs are governed by the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]], which mandates that sites be selected for their "flora, fauna, or geological or physiographical features".&lt;ref name=NCC&gt;''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', Part A: "Rationale". (Nature Conservancy Council; 1989) ({{ISBN|086139 544 1}}). Downloaded from {{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/sssi_ptA.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910045650/http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/sssi_ptA.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}, 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The body responsible for designating biological SSSIs in England is [[Natural England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification of SSSIs |work=Natural England |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |accessdate=2006-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515062100/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/special/sssi/notification.cfm |archivedate=2012-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from [[English Nature]] on its creation in 2006. Earth sciences SSSIs are notified separately by the [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]] across the entire UK via [[Geological Conservation Review]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jncc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=2947 Joint Nature Conservation Committee: Geological Conservation Review (GCR)] (accessed 14 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Natural England, like its predecessor bodies, uses a system of areas termed "[[Area of Search|Areas of Search]]", which broadly correspond with the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974–1996 counties]],&lt;ref name=NCC /&gt; and for consistency the same approach is followed here. In the case of Cheshire, the Area of Search differs from the modern [[ceremonial county]] boundary. Since the 1990s, [[Conservation (ethic)|nature conservation]] in England has also focused on 120 [[natural area]]s: regions defined by natural features rather than by administrative boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/biodiversity/englands/naturalareas.aspx Natural England: Natural Areas] (accessed 15 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meres /&gt; The Cheshire Area of Search encompasses four natural areas.&lt;ref name=cheshire_list /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/NA_search.asp Natural England: Natural Areas: Search Natural Areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717223807/http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/na_search.asp |date=2009-07-17 }} (accessed 15 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cheshire Natural Areas.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Sketch map showing the broad locations of the four natural areas]]
The majority of the SSSIs fall within the ''Meres and Mosses'' natural area, which covers the bulk of the county, extending into [[Shropshire]] and [[Staffordshire]] to the south.&lt;ref name=cheshire_list /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meres&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090206123905/http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles/naProfile27.pdf English Nature: Meres and Mosses (27 February 1998)] (accessed 10 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This region is dominated by the [[Cheshire Plain]], a wide expanse of flat or gently undulating farmland which rarely rises above 100&amp;nbsp;metres in elevation. Despite intensive agricultural use, diverse [[wetland]] habitats survive including mosses ([[bog]]s), [[swamp]]s, [[fen]]s, [[Mere (lake)|meres]] and thousands of [[pond]]s. Flashes, originating in subsidence after salt extraction, contain examples of inland [[salt marsh]], an extremely rare habitat internationally.&lt;ref name=Meres /&gt; [[Ancient woodland]] is sparse throughout this area, but is found on the slopes of the [[Mid Cheshire Ridge]] and in river valleys towards the north of the county. The lowland [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] habitat is very rare, occurring only at a handful of sites. The Mid Cheshire Ridge rises abruptly in the middle of the plain, with a high point of 227&amp;nbsp;metres; its [[Triassic]] [[sandstone]]s are exposed at the [[Bickerton Hill|Raw Head]] geological site.&lt;ref name=Meres /&gt;

[[File:Peckforton Hills 2.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Raw Head]] is one of the area's geological SSSIs]]
Two extensive sites, [[River Goyt|Goyt Valley]] and [[Leek Moors]], lie at the eastern edge of the county and the south-western end of the [[Pennines]], within the ''South West Peak'' natural area of the [[Peak District]].&lt;ref name=cheshire_list /&gt;&lt;ref name=SWPeak&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090206125905/http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles/naProfile29.pdf Natural England: The South West Peak Natural Area Profile] (accessed 13 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; At a significantly higher elevation than the other Cheshire SSSIs and underlain by [[Millstone Grit|millstone grit]] and [[shale]], they contain a variety of upland habitats, predominantly heather [[moorland]], [[grassland]] and [[blanket mire]].&lt;ref name=SWPeak /&gt;

Ten SSSIs are located in [[Warrington]] and the former boroughs of [[Borough of Halton|Halton]] and [[Ellesmere Port and Neston|Ellesmere Port &amp; Neston]], in the north-west of the county. These fall within the ''Urban Mersey Basin'' natural area, which also covers [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Merseyside]]. Although the area as a whole is one of the most densely populated regions in Europe, much of the area within Cheshire is farmland. Semi-natural habitats here include ancient woodland, [[raised bog]] and freshwater wetland. The [[Rixton Clay Pits]] site represents former industrial land, and [[Cutting (transportation)|railway cuttings]] expose geological features.&lt;ref name=cheshire_list /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mersey&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090206131148/http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles/naProfile26.pdf English Nature: The Urban Mersey Basin Natural Area: A Nature Conservation Profile (March 1997)] (accessed 13 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the ''[[Liverpool Bay]]'' coastal region contains two [[estuary|estuaries]], the [[Mersey Estuary|Mersey]] and [[Dee Estuary|Dee]], which are Cheshire's largest SSSIs.&lt;ref name=cheshire_list /&gt;&lt;ref name=Liverpool&gt;[http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles%5CnaProfile117.pdf Natural England: Liverpool Bay Natural Area: A nature conservation profile (29 October 1997)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922121415/http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/Science/natural/profiles/naProfile117.pdf |date=22 September 2012 }} (accessed 14 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

About a third of the country's total area is protected to a certain degree as a [[national park]], [[game reserve]], [[marine park]], [[forest reserve]] or the like.

The following list gives an overview on the various protected areas in [[Tanzania]] including their predominant habitat, wildlife and flora. Especially remarkable species ([[endemism|endemics]] or those occurring in unusually large numbers) are set in bold.

==National parks==
All 16 national parks together comprise an area of more than 42,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. They are administered by the [[Tanzania National Parks Authority]] (TANAPA). Names like Arusha and Serengeti are well known, partly due to films about African wildlife.

Storms named by Port Moresby are automatically retired regardless of their impact due to their infrequent occurrence.&lt;ref name="SPAC TCOP"/&gt;

Within the Australian region, there have been a total of 113&amp;nbsp;tropical cyclone names retired, with the 1990s accounting for 44 of these. Two of the most intense systems ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere, [[Cyclone Gwenda|Cyclones Gwenda]] and [[Cyclone Inigo|Inigo]] each attaining a [[barometric pressure]] of 900&amp;nbsp;hPa (26.58&amp;nbsp;inHg), are among the retired storms. The deadliest cyclone to take place since the 1960s was Cyclone Guba in 2007 which killed 149 people in Papua New Guinea. Additionally, the most damaging system was [[Cyclone Tracy|Severe Tropical Cyclone Tracy]] in 1974 which devastated the city of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], leaving A${{formatprice|837000000}} (A${{formatprice|5647016080}} 2011&amp;nbsp;AUD; US${{formatprice|2640000000}} 2011&amp;nbsp;USD) in losses.

==Background==
{{Main article|Tropical cyclone naming|History of tropical cyclone naming|List of historical tropical cyclone names}}
Within the region the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems, is generally given to the [[Queensland Government]] Meteorologist [[Clement Wragge]], who named systems between 1887 - 1907.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, Ray|url=http://www.metsoc.org.nz/system/files/journals/10/1/1990_101_24-26_rsmith.pdf|journal=Weather and Climate|year=1990|publisher=The Meteorological Society of New Zealand|volume=10|title=What's in a Name?|issue=1|pages=24–26|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wragge used names drawn from the letters of the Greek alphabet, Greek and Roman mythology and female names, to describe weather systems including tropical cyclones over [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; After the new [[Australian government]] had failed to create a federal weather bureau and appoint him director, Wragge started naming cyclones after political figures.&lt;ref name="TC FAQ B1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Landsea, Christopher W |author2=Dorst, Neal M |date=1 June 2014 |title=Tropical Cyclone Frequently Asked Question |chapter=Subject: Tropical Cyclone Names: B1) How are tropical cyclones named? |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/TCFAQ_B.txt |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Q9nmDAns?url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/TCFAQ_B.txt |archivedate=7 June 2014 |publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, before the [[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] started to use female names for tropical cyclones in the region during the [[1963-64 Australian region cyclone season|1963-64 cyclone season]].&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt;

During the International Women's Year of 1975 the [[Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Australia)#List of science ministers|Australian Science Minister]] ordered that tropical cyclones, within the Australian region should carry both men's and women's names.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; This was because the minister thought "that both sexes should bear the odium of the devastation caused by cyclones."&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt; As a result, male names were added to the lists of names for both basins, ahead of the 1975-76 season.&lt;ref name="Whats in a name?"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|title=Sex-Shift in Australia: A Cyclone Named 'Alan'|date=30 September 1975|agency=Reuters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/01/archives/sexshift-in-australia-a-cyclone-named-alan.html}} {{Subscription required|via=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the [[United States Weather Bureau]] in the Northern Atlantic basin, after hurricanes [[Hurricane Carol|Carol]], [[Hurricane Edna|Edna]], and [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] struck the [[Northeastern United States]] and caused a significant amount of damage in the previous year.&lt;ref name="Mahina"&gt;{{cite web|title=They Called the Wind Mahina: The History of Naming Cyclones|author=Dorst, Neal|url=ftp://ftp.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/pub/dorst/Mahina.pptx|author2=Hurricane Research Division|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|page=Slides 8–72|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced, however, it was decided at the 1969 Interdepartmental hurricane conference, that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired.&lt;ref name="Mahina"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anna"&gt;{{cite news|title=It's time (June) to match for Anna...|newspaper=The Daily Gleaner|date=1 June 1969|author=Reuters|page=2|location=Kingston, Jamaica}}{{subscription required|via=The Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several names have been removed from the Pacific naming lists for various other reasons than causing a significant amount of death/destruction, which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and  political reasons.&lt;ref name="WMO"&gt;{{cite book|title=Regional Association IV: Hurricane Operational Plan 2013|date=30 May 2013|author=RA IV Hurricane Committee|pages=98–99|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/OPERATIONALPLAN2013_en.pdf|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|chapter=Chapter 9: Tropical Cyclone Names|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRD"&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=21 June 2014|author=Landsea, Christopher W|author2=Dorst, Neal|publisher=United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|author5=Hurricane Research Division|date=20 June 2014|chapter=Subject: B3) What storm names have been retired?|title=Tropical Cyclone Frequently Asked Questions:|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 1970s==
[[File:Retired Australian cyclone tracks 1970s.png|thumb|right|Tracks of storms retired in the 1970s]]
During the 1970s, 18 tropical cyclones had their names retired.&lt;ref name="Retired Names"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/about/names.shtml|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|year=2010|title=Tropical Cyclone Names}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} During this period, one of the most well-known storms in Australian history, [[Cyclone Tracy]], took place. It was both the costliest and deadliest of the decade; it would remain the costliest Australian cyclone until 2011 when [[Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi]] surpassed it. A total of 87 people were killed between these storms and A$977&amp;nbsp;million was wrought in damage.

==Tropical Cyclone names retired in the 2000s==
[[File:Retired Australian cyclone tracks 2000s.png|thumb|right|Tracks of storms retired in the 2000s]]
During the 2000s, 23 tropical cyclone names were retired. At the start of the 2008-09 season two sets of Indonesian names were established for the newly established TCWC Jakarta, while the naming lists for the three Australian TCWC's were combined. The name Hamish subsequently became the first name to be retired from these lists, after it impacted the coast of Queensland during 2008-09. The name Laurence was retired after it intensified into a category 5 severe tropical cyclone twice during December 2009 and affected Western Australia.&lt;ref name="Laurence"&gt;{{cite report|title=Severe Tropical Cyclone Laurence |date=19 May 2010 |format=PDF |archivedate=22 March 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2011 |author2=Perth Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre |publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Mdwf2sI?url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/laurence09.pdf |author=Paterson, Linda |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/laurence09.pdf |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''liturgical year''', also known as the '''church year''' or '''Christian year''', as well as the '''kalendar'''&lt;!-- "kalendar" is the correct spelling in this context --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascension-acc.org/kalendar.html|title=Kalendar|year=2015|publisher=Anglican Catholic Church|accessdate=May 23, 2015|quote=It is as a result of this connection that "kalendar/calendar" came to refer to the orderly arrangement of time as we now know it, but the established church retained the older "K" spelling to distinguish their kalendar from an ordinary list of events. In other words, a kalendar is simply a church calendar!}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of the cycle of [[liturgy|liturgical]] seasons in [[Christian church]]es that determines when [[feast day]]s, including [[Calendar of saints|celebrations of saints]], are to be observed, and which portions of [[Scripture]] are to be read either in an annual cycle or in a cycle of several years.

Distinct [[liturgical colours]] may appear in connection with different seasons of the liturgical year. The dates of the festivals vary somewhat between the different churches, though the sequence and logic is largely the same.

==Liturgical cycle==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
{{Liturgical year}}
[[File:Liturgical year.svg|thumb|The liturgical year of some western churches other than the Catholic Church, indicating the [[liturgical colours]].]]
The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their own mood, [[Christian theology|theological]] emphases, and modes of [[prayer]], which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of [[parament]]s and [[vestment]]s for clergy, [[Bible|scriptural]] readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home. In churches that follow the liturgical year, the scripture passages for each Sunday (and even each day of the year in some traditions) are specified in a [[lectionary]]. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], Anglicans and Lutherans continued to follow the lectionary of the [[Roman Rite]]. Following a decision of the [[Second Vatican Council]], the [[Catholic Church]] revised that lectionary in 1969, adopting a three-year cycle of readings for Sundays and a two-year cycle for weekdays.

Adaptations of the revised Roman Rite lectionary were adopted by Protestants, leading to the publication in 1994 of the [[Revised Common Lectionary]] for Sundays and major feasts, which is now used by many Protestant denominations, including also [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]], [[United and uniting churches|United]], etc. This has led to a greater awareness of the traditional Christian year among Protestants, especially among [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] denominations.

==Biblical calendars==

Scholars are not in agreement about whether the calendars used by the Jews before the [[Babylonian exile]] were [[solar calendar|solar]] (based on the return of the same relative position between the sun and the earth), [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] (based on months that corresponded to the cycle of the moon, with periodic additional months to bring the calendar back into agreement with the solar cycle) like the present-day [[Jewish calendar]] of [[Hillel II]], or purely lunar, as the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sacha |last=Stern |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiFIKURVNRwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jewish+calendars&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=jewish%20calendars&amp;f=false |title=Calendar and Community: A History of the Jewish Calendar |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-827034-8 |pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first month of the Hebrew year was called אביב (Aviv), evidently adopted by [[Moses]] from Ipip as the eleventh month of the non-lunar [[Egyptian calendar]] (that is also the origin of Abib as the tenth month of the non-lunar [[Ethiopian calendar]]),&lt;ref&gt;"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:2}}). "This day came ye out in the month Aviv" ({{bibleverse||Exodus|13:4}})&lt;/ref&gt; meaning the month of green ears of grain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H24&amp;t=KJV Gesenius's Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt;  Having to occur at the appropriate time in the spring, it thus was originally part of a [[tropical year|tropical calendar]]. At about the time of the [[Babylonian exile]], when using the Babylonian civil calendar, the Jews adopted as the name for the month the term ניסן ([[Nisan]]),&lt;ref&gt;"In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar" ({{bibleverse||Esther|3:7}}),&lt;/ref&gt; based on the Babylonian name Nisanu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/pa2/passover/months-of-the-jewish-calendar.html Months of the Jewish Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas J Talley says that the adoption of the Babylonian term occurred even before the exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_O8F_iGcqkC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=Babylonian+name+Nisan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XAUETDV3JK&amp;sig=V4K3fsY5n0fd0kPfkAIxdZiNoDc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gGRpS4zwDKS60gTFvMWsCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Babylonian%20name%20Nisan&amp;f=false |first=Thomas J. |last=Talley |title=The Origins of the Liturgical Year |publisher=Pueblo Publishing Company |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8146-6075-1 |pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earlier calendar, most of the months were simply called by a number (such as "the fifth month"). The Babylonian-derived names of the month that are used by Jews are:
# [[Nisan]] (March–April)
# [[Iyar]] (April–May)
# [[Sivan]] (May–June)
# [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] (June–July)
# [[Av]] (July–August)
# [[Elul]] (August–September)
# [[Tishrei]] (September–October)
# [[Cheshvan]] (October–November)
# [[Kislev]] (November–December)
# [[Tevet]] (December–January)
# [[Shevat]] (January–February)
# [[Adar]] (February–March)

In Biblical times, the following Jewish religious feasts were celebrated :
* [[Pesach]] (Passover) – 14 [[Nisan]] (sacrifice of a lamb), 15 Nisan ([[Passover seder]])
* [[Shavuot]] ([[Pentecost]]) – Fiftieth day counted from Passover, normally 6 [[Sivan]]
* "Day of Blowing Shofar/Trumpet" (now known as [[Rosh Hashanah]]) – 1 [[Tishrei]]

{{further|Syro Malabar Liturgical Calendar}}
The Liturgical Calendar of the [[Catholic church]]es of [[East Syriac Rite]] (i.e. the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]]) is fixed according to the flow of salvation history. With a focus upon the historical life of Jesus Christ, believers are led to the eschatological fulfilment (i.e. the heavenly bliss) through this special arrangement of liturgical seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Pathikulangara, Varghese. ''Mar Toma Margam'', (A New Catechism for the St. Thomas Christians of India), Kottayam: Denha Services, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The liturgical year is divided into 8 seasons of approximately 7 weeks each but adjusted to fit the solar calendar. The arrangement of the Seasons in the Liturgical Year is based on seven central events on celebrations of the Salvation History. They are:
# [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] of Christ
# [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] of Christ
# [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of Christ
# [[Pentecost]]
# [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]
# [[Feast of the Cross|Glorious Cross]]
# [[Parousia]] (the Dedication of Church after Christ's second coming)

The biblical reading and prayers during Mass and [[Liturgy of the Hours]] varies according to different seasons in liturgical calendar.

====Liturgical Calendar====
The various seasons of the liturgical calendar of [[Syro Malabar Church]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] are given below.

=====Annunciation (Subara)=====
Weeks of Annunciation (Subara) is the first season of the liturgical year. The liturgical year begins with the proclamation and celebration of the historical encounter between God and man in the person of Jesus Christ, the human appearance of the Divine Person. The Syriac word Subara, 'Annunciation', with which the Church qualify the first five or six weeks of her liturgical year, is, in fact, an announcement and proclamation with celebration with this supreme glad news of divine condescension to the human frailty in order to raise it up to the divine sublimity. The season begins on the Sunday just before the 1st of December and ends with the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] that is [[Feast of the Baptism of the Lord]]. This season is developed in the context of the mystery of incarnation completed in the fullness of time. The Church recalls during these days the announcement of the birth of John the Baptist, the predecessor of Jesus, and also the joyful event of the birth of John the Baptist. As a preparation for the celebration of the mystery of incarnation, this season also recalls creation, disobedience of our first parents and its consequences, the miserable state of the broken humanity, the promise of salvation offered by God, God’s covenant with humanity, and the prophecies about the Saviour. During this season we also meditate on the role of Mary in the history of the plan of salvation. The whole importance of Mary, and hence her veneration in the Church, depends on her relation to Jesus, the most special being His mother. Her celebration is also underlined with two very solemn festivals of her: Immaculate Conception on December 8 and Congratulation to Mary as Mother of Jesus on the last Friday of this season. The Church practices abstinence during December 1–25 in preparation for Christmas; this period is called "25 days Lent".{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}
;Feasts celebrated during this season

* Feast of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] (last Friday of Season)

=====Epiphany (Denha)=====
Weeks of Epiphany begins on the Sunday closer to the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and runs to the beginning of Great Fast. The word Denha in Syriac means sunrise. During the period the faithful meditates on the manifestation of Holy trinity and revelation of Christ the light of the world. Baptism in Jordan was the first historical event when the Holy Trinity is revealed to humans in the humanity of Jesus Christ. During the season church celebrate the feasts of Saints in connection with the manifestation of the Lord.

=====Great Fast (Sawma Rabba)=====
During these weeks the faithful reflect on and meditate over the public life of Jesus and especially on its culmination in his passion, death and burial. The season begins 50 days before Easter on Peturta Sunday and comprises whole period of [[Great Lent]] and culminates on [[Easter|Resurrection Sunday]]. Word Peturta in Syriac means "looking back" or "reconciliation". It is a God-given time for turning to one’s own life more deeply and to become convinced of the abundant blessings of the loving God – the creation, the providential caring, the human fall, the helplessness of man to save himself, the promise of salvation, the redemption through His Son Jesus and the Passion of the Christ.
Faithful enter the weeks of Great Fast, celebrating the memory of all the Faithful Departed on the last Friday of Denha. According to the ecclesial and liturgical vision of this tradition, the weeks of Great Fast is also an occasion to keep up the memory of the beloved Departed through special prayers, renunciation, almsgiving, and so on and thus prepare oneself for a good death and resurrection in Jesus Christ. During the fast faithful of [[Syro Malabar Church]] do not use meat, fish egg many dairy products and most favorite food items and also avoid sexual contacts on all days including Sundays and Feast days. Before European colonisation [[Nasrani (India)|Indian Nasranis]] used to take only food on once in a day (after 3:00PM) on all days during Great Fast.

Church also commemorates various events happened after resurrection of Christ such as visits of Jesus to Apostles, ascension of Jesus.

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
{{Main article|Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar}}

The Liturgical year in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] is characterized by alternating [[fasting|fasts]] and [[calendar of saints|feasts]], and is in many ways similar to the Roman Catholic year. However, Church New Year ([[Indiction]]) traditionally begins on [[September 1 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|September 1]] ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style or New Style]]), rather than the first Sunday of Advent. It includes both feasts on the [[Eastern Orthodox Church calendar|Fixed Cycle]] and the [[Paschal Cycle]] (or Moveable Cycle). The most important feast day by far is the Feast of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter)—the Feast of Feasts. Then the [[Great Feasts|Twelve Great Feasts]], which commemorate various significant events in the lives of [[Jesus Christ]] and of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Virgin Mary]]).

The majority of Orthodox Christians (Russians, in particular) follow the [[Julian Calendar]] in calculating their ecclesiastical feasts, but many (including the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Church of Greece), while preserving the Julian calculation for feasts on the Paschal Cycle, have adopted the [[Revised Julian Calendar]] (at present coinciding with the [[Gregorian Calendar]]) to calculate those feasts which are fixed according to the calendar date.

Between 1900 and 2100, there is a thirteen-day difference between the dates of the Julian and the Revised Julian and Gregorian calendars. Thus, for example, where Christmas is celebrated on December 25 O.S. ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]), the celebration coincides with [[December 25 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|January 7]] in the Revised Calendar. The computation of the day of [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter) is, however, always computed according to a [[lunar calendar]] based on the Julian Calendar, even by those churches which observe the Revised Calendar.

There are four fasting seasons during the year: The most important fast is [[Great Lent]] which is an intense time of fasting, [[almsgiving]] and prayer, extending for forty days prior to [[Palm Sunday]] and [[Holy Week]], as a preparation for [[Easter|Pascha]]. The [[Nativity Fast]] (Winter Lent) is a time of preparation for the Feast of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity of Christ]] (Christmas), but whereas Advent in the West lasts only four weeks, Nativity Fast lasts a full forty days. The [[Apostles' Fast]] is variable in length, lasting anywhere from eight days to six weeks, in preparation for the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] ([[June 29 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|June 29]]). The [[Dormition Fast]] lasts for two weeks from [[August 1 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|August 1]] to [[August 14 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|August 14]] in preparation for the Feast of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]] ([[August 15 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|August 15]]). The liturgical year is so constructed that during each of these fasting seasons, one of the Great Feasts occurs, so that fasting may be tempered with joy.

In addition to these fasting seasons, Orthodox Christians fast on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year (and some Orthodox [[monastery|monasteries]] also observe Monday as a fast day). Certain fixed days are always fast days, even if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday (in which case the fast is lessened somewhat, but not abrogated altogether); these are: The [[Decollation]] of St. [[John the Baptist]], the [[Exaltation of the Cross]] and the day before the Epiphany (January 5). There are several fast-free periods, when it is forbidden to fast, even on Wednesday and Friday. These are: the week following Pascha, the week following [[Pentecost]], the period from the Nativity of Christ until January the 5th and the first week of the [[Triodion]] (the week following the 17th Sunday before Pentecost).

====Pascha====
{{Main article|Easter|l1=Pascha}}
The greatest feast is Pascha. Easter for both East and West is calculated as the first Sunday after the [[full moon]] that falls on or after March 21 (nominally the day of the [[vernal equinox]]), but the Orthodox calculations are based on the [[Julian calendar]], whose March 21 corresponds at present with April 3 of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and on calculations of the date of full moon different from those used in the West (see [[computus]] for further details).

The date of Pascha is central to the entire ecclesiastical year, determining not only the date for the beginning of Great Lent and Pentecost, but affecting the cycle of [[moveable feast]]s, of scriptural readings and the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] (texts chanted according to the eight ecclesiastical modes) throughout the year. There are also a number of lesser feasts throughout the year that are based upon the date of Pascha. The moveable cycle begins on the [[Zacchaeus]] Sunday (the first Sunday in preparation for Great Lent or the 33rd Sunday after Pentecost as it is known), though the cycle of the Octoechos continues until Palm Sunday.

The date of Pascha affects the following liturgical seasons:
*The period of the [[Triodion]] (the Sundays before Great Lent, [[Cheesefare Week]], Palm Sunday, and Holy Week)
*The period of the [[Pentecostarion]] (Sunday of Pascha through the Sunday After Pentecost which is also called the Sunday of all saints)

====The twelve Great Feasts====
{{Main article|Great Feasts}}

Some of these feasts follow the Fixed Cycle, and some follow the Moveable (Paschal) Cycle. Most of those on the Fixed Cycle have a period of preparation called a [[Afterfeast|Forefeast]], and a period of celebration afterward, similar to the Western [[Octave (liturgical)|Octave]], called an Afterfeast. Great Feasts on the Paschal Cycle do not have Forefeasts. The lengths of Forefeasts and Afterfeasts vary, according to the feast.
* '''[[Nativity of the Theotokos]]''' ([[September 8 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|September 8]])
** birth of the [[Theotokos]] to [[Joachim]] and [[Saint Anne|Anna]]
* '''[[Exaltation of the Cross|Elevation of the Cross]]''' ([[September 14 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|September 14]])
** the rediscovery of the original [[Christian Cross|Cross]] on which Christ was crucified
* '''[[Presentation of Mary|Entrance of the Theotokos into the Temple]]''' ([[November 21 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|November 21]])
** the entry of the [[Theotokos]] into the Temple around the age of 3
* '''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ''' ([[December 25 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|December 25]])

** Christ's presentation as an infant in the Temple by the [[Theotokos]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].
* '''[[Annunciation]] of the [[Theotokos]]''' ([[March 25 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|March 25]])
** [[Archangel Gabriel|Gabriel]]'s announcement to the [[Theotokos]] that she will conceive the Christ, and her wilful agreement thereto
&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: In Eastern practice, should this feast fall during Holy Week or on Pascha itself, the feast of the Annunciation is not transferred to another day. In fact, the conjunction of the feasts of the Annunciation and Pascha (known as  διπλή Πασχαλιά, ''dipli Paschalia'' in [[Modern Greek]]) is considered an extremely festive event.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''[[Palm Sunday|Entry into Jerusalem]]''' (Sunday before [[Easter|Pascha]])
** known in the West as Palm Sunday.
* '''[[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]''' (40 days after Pascha)
** Christ's ascension into Heaven following his resurrection.
* '''[[Pentecost]]''' (50 days after Pascha)
** The [[Holy Spirit]] comes and indwells the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] and other Christian believers.

** Christ's Transfiguration as witnessed by Peter, James and John.
* '''[[Dormition of the Theotokos]]''' ([[August 15 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|August 15]])
** The falling asleep of the [[Theotokos]] (cf. the [[Assumption of Mary]] in [[Western Christianity]])

====Cycles====
{{See also|Paschal Cycle}}

In addition to the Fixed and Moveable Cycles, there are a number of other [[Weekly cycle|liturgical cycles]] in the ecclesiastical year that affect the celebration of the divine services. These include, the [[Canonical Hours#Daily Cycle of services|Daily Cycle]], the [[Canonical Hours#Liturgical cycles|Weekly Cycle]], the Cycle of [[Matins Gospel]]s, and the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]].

{{see also|Movable Western Christian observances}}
Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, including Lutheran, Anglican, and other Protestant calendars since this cycle pre-dates the Reformation. Generally, the liturgical seasons in western Christianity are [[Advent]], [[Christmas]], Ordinary Time (Time after [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]), [[Lent]], [[Easter]], and Ordinary Time (Time after [[Pentecost]]). Some Protestant traditions do not include Ordinary Time: every day falls into a denominated season.

[[Vanderbilt University]] Professor Hoyt L. Hickman, with regard to the calendars of the Western Christians Churches that use the [[Revised Common Lectionary]],&lt;ref name="Hickman2010"/&gt; including Presbyterians, Methodists, Anglicans/Episcopalians, Lutherans and some Baptists, among others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdpresbyterian.org/worship/worship_docs/The-Liturgical-Year.pdf|title=The Liturgical Year|last=Fisher|first=Jeanne|year=2015|work=Third Presbyterian Church|publisher=[[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]]|accessdate=September 29, 2015|quote=The Revised Common Lectionary, used by Presbyterians, Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans and some Baptists, is arranged in a three-year cycle.}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that:&lt;ref name="Hickman2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hickman|first=Hoyt L.|title=The New Handbook of the Christian Year: Based on the Revised Common Lectionary|date=October 1, 2010|publisher=Abingdon Press|isbn=9781426730740|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|All these calendars agree that the Lord's Day is of primary importance among the observances of the year and that the Christian Year contains two central cycles--the Easter cycle and the Christmas cycle. Each cycle includes a festival season (Easter and Christmas), preceded by a season of preparation and anticipation (Lent and Advent). In most denominational versions and in the ''Common Lectionary'', Lent and Advent are immediately preceded by a transitional Sunday (Transfiguration and Christ the King), and the Easter and Christmas Seasons are immediately followed by a transitional Sunday (Trinity and Baptism of the Lord).&lt;ref name="Hickman2010"/&gt;}}
Protestant Churches, with exception of the Lutheran and Anglican, generally observe fewer feasts with regard to the saints, than the aforementioned liturgical denominations, in addition to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches. 

===Denominational specifics===
====Catholic Church====

The [[Catholic Church]] sets aside certain days and seasons of each year to recall and celebrate various events in the life of Christ. In its [[Roman Rite]] the liturgical year begins with [[Advent]], the time of preparation for both the celebration of Jesus' birth, and his expected second coming at the end of time. This season lasts until [[Christmas Eve]] on December 24.&lt;ref name="OneFaith116"&gt;Barry, ''One Faith, One Lord'' (2001), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christmas]]tide follows, beginning with First Vespers of Christmas on the evening of December 24 and ending with the [[Feast of the Baptism of the Lord]]. Traditionally, the end of Christmastide was February 2nd, or the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Feast of the Presentation]] of the Lord, also known as [[Candlemas]]. This feast recounts the 40 days of rest Mary took before being purified and presenting her first-born son to the Temple in Jerusalem.

[[Lent]] is the period of purification and penance that begins on [[Ash Wednesday]] and ends on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]. The Holy Thursday evening [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]] marks the beginning of the [[Easter Triduum]], which includes [[Good Friday]], [[Holy Saturday]], and [[Easter Sunday]].&lt;ref name="OneFaith116"/&gt; The days of the Easter Triduum recall Jesus' [[Last Supper]] with his disciples, death on the cross, burial, and resurrection. The seven-week liturgical season of [[Easter]] immediately follows the Triduum, climaxing at [[Pentecost]]. This last feast recalls the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus' disciples after the [[Ascension of Jesus]]. The rest of the liturgical year is commonly known as [[Ordinary Time]].&lt;ref name="OneFaith116"/&gt;

There are many forms of liturgy in the Catholic Church. Even putting aside the many Eastern rites in use, the [[Latin liturgical rites]] alone include the [[Ambrosian Rite]], the [[Mozarabic Rite]], and the [[Cistercian Rite]], as well as other forms that have been largely abandoned in favour of adopting the [[Roman Rite]].

Of this rite, what is now the "ordinary" or, to use a word employed in the [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI accompanying the motu proprio ''Summorum Pontificum''], the "normal" form is that which developed from the [[Second Vatican Council]] to the present day, while the form in force in 1962 is authorized as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] without restriction in private celebrations, and under the conditions indicated in article 5 of the motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' in public celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_en.html Pope Benedict XVI, ''Summorum Pontificum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The liturgical calendar in that form of the Roman Rite (see [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]) differs in some respects from that of the present ordinary form, as will be noted below, and also from the earlier [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]], the still earlier [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]] and the original [[Tridentine Calendar]]. These articles can be consulted with regard to the Roman-Rite liturgical year before 1960.

{{Further|Calendar of saints (Lutheran)}}

====Anglican Church====

{{Further information|List of Anglican Church Calendars}}

The [[Church of England]], [[Mother Church]] of the [[Anglican Communion]], uses a liturgical year that is in most respects identical to that of the Roman Church. While this is less true of the calendars contained within the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and the ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'' (1980), it is particularly true since the Anglican Church adopted its new pattern of services and liturgies contained within ''[[Common Worship]]'', in 2000. Certainly, the broad division of the year into the Christmas and Easter seasons, interspersed with periods of Ordinary Time, is identical, and the majority of the Festivals and Commemorations are also celebrated, with a few exceptions.

In some Anglican traditions (including the Church of England) the Christmas season is followed by an Epiphany season, which begins on the Eve of the Epiphany (on 6 January or the nearest Sunday) and ends on the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Feast of the Presentation]] (on February  2 or the nearest Sunday). Ordinary Time then begins after this period.

The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' contains within it the traditional Western Eucharistic lectionary which traces its roots to the ''Comes'' of St. Jerome in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xZLNDitdTRYC&amp;pg=PA475&amp;dq=%22Comes+Hieronymi%22+Anglican&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7XyDTeXcJo2YhQelodHFBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22comes%20hieronymi%22&amp;f=false The Annotated Book of Common Prayer p. 242]&lt;/ref&gt; Its similarity to the ancient lectionary is particularly obvious during Trinity season (Sundays after the Sunday after Pentecost), reflecting that understanding of sanctification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Sparrow|Sparrow, Anthony]] and [[John Henry Newman|John Henry Cardinal Newman]]. ''A Rationale upon the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England'', Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reformed Churches====
[[Calvinism|Reformed]] Christians emphasize weekly celebration of the [[Lord's day]] and, while some of them celebrate also what they call the five [[evangelical feast]]s, others celebrate no holy days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allsaints-church.com/church-calendar-defense.aspx Gregg Strawbridge, "Why the Church Calendar Is Important"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical calendar===

====Advent====
[[File:Rok liturgiczny - Liturgical year.jpg|thumb|left|Roman Rite liturgical year]]
{{Main article|Advent}}
[[Advent]] (from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wiktionary:Adventus|adventus]]'', which means "arrival" or "coming") is the first season of the liturgical year. It begins four Sundays before Christmas, the Sunday falling on or nearest to November 30, and ends on Christmas Eve. Traditionally observed as a "fast", it focuses on preparation for the coming of [[Christ]], not only the coming of the Christ-child at Christmas, but also, in the first weeks, on the [[eschatology|eschatological]] final coming of Christ, making Advent "a period for devout and joyful expectation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWLITYR.HTM General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

This season is often marked by the [[Advent Wreath]], a garland of evergreens with four candles. Although the main symbolism of the advent wreath is simply marking the progression of time, many churches attach themes to each candle, most often 'hope', 'faith', 'joy', and 'love'.  Other popular devotions during Advent include the use of the [[Advent Calendar]] or the [[Tree of Jesse]] to count down the days to Christmas.

[[File:Advent Wreath on Christmas Eve (Broadway United Methodist Church).jpg|250px|thumb|A white coloured [[parament]] hangs from the [[pulpit]], indicating that the current liturgical season is [[Christmastide]]. The fact that the Christ Candle in the centre of the [[Advent wreath]] is lit also indicates that [[Christmas]] has arrived.]]
{{Main article|Christmastide}}
The [[Christmas season]] immediately follows Advent. The traditional [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] begin with [[Christmas Eve]] on the evening of [[December 24]] and continue until the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. The actual Christmas season continues until the [[Feast of the Baptism of Christ]], which in the present form of the Roman Rite is celebrated on the Sunday after January 6, or the following Monday if that Sunday is Epiphany.&lt;ref name="maternalheart.org"&gt;[http://www.maternalheart.org/library/1962rubrics.pdf Code of Rubrics included in the 1962 Roman Missal, 72]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre-1970 form, this feast is celebrated on January 13, unless January 13 is a Sunday, in which case the feast of the [[Holy Family]] is celebrated instead.&lt;ref name="maternalheart.org"/&gt; Until the suppression of the Octave of the Epiphany in the 1960 reforms, January 13 was the Octave day of the Epiphany, providing the date for the end of the season.

Traditionally, the end of Christmastide was February 2nd, or the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Feast of the Presentation]] of the Lord, also known as [[Candlemas]]. This feast recounts the 40 days of rest Mary took before being purified and presenting her first-born son to the Temple in Jerusalem. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Feast of the Purification (Candlemas)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fisheaters.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval times, Candlemas eve (Feb. 1st) marked the day when all Christmas decorations, including the [[Christmas tree]] and the [[Nativity scene]], were taken down. However, the tradition of ending Christmastide on Candlemas has slowly waned, except in some pockets of the Hispanic world where Candlemas (or La Fiesta de la Candelaria) is still an important feast and the unofficial end of the Christmas season.

====Ordinary Time ====
{{Main article|Ordinary Time|}}

"Ordinary" comes from the same root as our word "ordinal", and in this sense means "the counted weeks". In the Roman Catholic Church and in some Protestant traditions, these are the common weeks which do not belong to a proper season. In Latin, these seasons are called the weeks ''per annum'', or "through the year".

In the current form of the Roman Rite adopted following the Second Vatican Council, Ordinary Time consists of 33 or 34 Sundays and is divided into two sections. The first portion extends from the day following the Feast of the Baptism of Christ until the day before Ash Wednesday (the beginning of Lent). It contains anywhere from three to eight Sundays, depending on how early or late Easter falls.

The main focus in the readings of the Mass is Christ's earthly ministry, rather than any one particular event. The counting of the Sundays resumes following Eastertide; however, two Sundays are replaced by Pentecost and Trinity Sunday, and depending on whether the year has 52 or 53 weeks, one may be omitted.

In the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite, the Time after Epiphany has anywhere from one to six Sundays. As in the current form of the rite, the season mainly concerns Christ's preaching and ministry, with many of his parables read as the Gospel readings. The season begins on January 14&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maternalheart.org/library/1962rubrics.pdf 1960 Code of Rubrics incorporated in the 1962 Roman Missal, 77]&lt;/ref&gt; and ends on the Saturday before Septuagesima Sunday. Omitted Sundays after Epiphany are transferred to Time after Pentecost and celebrated between the Twenty-Third and the Last Sunday after Pentecost according to an order indicated in the [[Code of Rubrics]], 18, with complete omission of any for which there is no Sunday available in the current year.&lt;ref&gt;"The Sunday which is set down as XXIV after Pentecost is always put in the last place, omitting, if need be, any others for which there happens to be no place" ([http://www.maternalheart.org/library/1962rubrics.pdf 1960 Code of Rubrics], 18).&lt;/ref&gt; Before the 1960 revisions, the omitted Sunday would be celebrated on the Saturday before Septuagesima Sunday,&lt;ref&gt;"If this II Sunday, or another after Epiphany, be impeded by Septuagesima supervening, and there be no place for it after Pentecost, according to the Rubrics, it is anticipated on Saturday with all privileges proper to an occurring Sunday." (Missale Romanum, 1939, Dominica II post Epiphaniam)&lt;/ref&gt; or, in the case of the Twenty-Third Sunday after Pentecost, on the Saturday before the Last Sunday after Pentecost.&lt;ref&gt;"If this Sunday be impeded by the last Sunday after Pentecost supervening, it is anticipated on Saturday with all privileges proper to an occurring Sunday, and in it is said Glória in excélsis, Credo, Preface of the Trinity and Ite, Missa est." (Missale Romanum, 1939, Dominica XXIII post Pentecosten)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liturgical colour'': green

====Septuagesima/Pre-Lenten Season====
{{Main article|Septuagesima|Pre-Lenten Season}}
Septuagesima (from the Latin word for "seventieth") is a two-and-a-half-week period before Lent. This pre-Lent season is present in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite and in some Protestant calendars. It is a transition from the first part of the season ''per annum''&lt;ref&gt;"The season ''per annum'' runs from January 14 to none of Saturday before Septuagesima Sunday" ([http://www.maternalheart.org/library/1962rubrics.pdf Code of Rubrics, 77]&lt;/ref&gt; to the season of Lent, and a preparation for the fasting and penance which begin on Ash Wednesday. Although most of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] remains the same as during the season ''per annum'', certain customs of Lent are adopted, including the suppression of the "Alleluia", the replacement of the [[Alleluia]] at Mass with the [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] and the Gloria is no longer said on Sundays.

In the 1969 reform of the Roman Rite, this intermediate season was removed, with these weeks becoming part of Ordinary Time.

''Liturgical colour'' (where observed): violet or purple

====Lent and Passiontide====
{{Main article|Lent|Passiontide|Holy Week}}

Lent is a major penitential season of preparation for [[Easter]]. It begins on [[Ash Wednesday]] and, if the penitential days of [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] are included, lasts for forty days, since the six Sundays within the season are not counted.

In the Roman Rite, the [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo]] and the [[Te Deum]] are not used in the Mass and Liturgy of the Hours respectively, except on Solemnities and Feasts, and the [[Alleluia]] and verse that usually precede the reading of the Gospel is either omitted or replaced with another acclamation.

Lutheran churches make these same omissions.

As in Advent, the deacon and subdeacon of the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite do not wear their habitual dalmatic and tunicle (signs of joy) in Masses of the season during Lent; instead they wear "folded chasubles", in accordance with the ancient custom.

In the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite, the two weeks before Easter form the season of Passiontide, a subsection of the Lenten season that begins with [[Matins]] of [[Ash Wednesday]] and ends immediately before the Mass of the [[Easter Vigil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceremoniaire.net/print/pastorale1950/Rubriques-1960.pdf Code of Rubrics], 74&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, what used to be officially called [[Passion Sunday]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; has the official name of the First Sunday in Passiontide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Missale Romanum 1962], p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Palm Sunday]] has the additional name of the Second Sunday in Passiontide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Missale Romanum 1962], p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; In Sunday and ferial Masses (but not on feasts celebrated in the first of these two weeks) the [[Gloria Patri]] is omitted at the [[Introit|Entrance Antiphon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maternalheart.org/library/1962rubrics.pdf Code of Rubrics], 428&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Lavabo,&lt;ref&gt;Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, VII, 6, in [http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Missale Romanum 1962], p. LIX; cf. [http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962.pdf Missale Romanum 1962], p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the responds in the Divine Office.

In the post-1969 form of the Roman Rite, "Passion Sunday" and "Palm Sunday" are both names for the Sunday before Easter, officially called "Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion". The former Passion Sunday became a fifth Sunday of Lent. The earlier form reads Matthew's account on Sunday, Mark's on Tuesday, and Luke's on Wednesday, while the post-1969 form reads the Passion only on Palm Sunday (with the three Synoptic Gospels arranged in a three-year cycle) and on [[Good Friday]], when it reads the Passion according to John, as also do earlier forms of the Roman Rite.

The veiling of crucifixes and images of the saints with violet cloth, which was obligatory before 1970, is left to the decision of the national bishops' conferences. In the United States, it is permitted but not required, at the discretion of the pastor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/innews/0306.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In all forms, the readings concern the events leading up to the [[Last Supper]] and the betrayal, Passion, and death of Christ.

The week before Easter is called [[Holy Week]].

In the Roman Rite, feasts that fall within that week are simply omitted, unless they have the rank of Solemnity, in which case they are transferred to another date. The only solemnities inscribed in the General Calendar that can fall within that week are those of [[St. Joseph]] and the [[Annunciation]].

''Liturgical colour'': violet or purple. The colour rose may be used, where it is the practice, on [[Laetare Sunday]] (4th Sunday of Lent). On [[Palm Sunday]] the colour since 1970 is red, by earlier rules violet or purple, with red being used after 1955 for the blessing of the palms.

====Easter Triduum====
{{Main article|Paschal Triduum}}

The Easter Triduum consists of Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/101/Start/97 General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 19]&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these days begins liturgically not with the morning but with the preceding evening.

The triduum begins on the evening before Good Friday with [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]], celebrated with white vestments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/2/SubIndex/38/ContentIndex/324/Start/319 Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper], 44&lt;/ref&gt; and often includes a ritual of ceremonial footwashing. It is customary on this night for a vigil involving private prayer to take place, beginning after the evening service and continuing until midnight. This vigil is occasionally renewed at dawn, continuing until the Good Friday liturgy.

During the day of [[Good Friday]] Mass is not celebrated in the Catholic Church. Instead a Celebration of the Passion of the Lord is held in the afternoon or evening. It consists of three parts: a [[Liturgy of the Word]] that includes the reading of the account of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] by [[John the Evangelist]] and concludes with a solemn [[General Intercessions|Universal Prayer]]. Other churches also have their Good Friday commemoration of the Passion.

The colour of vestments varies: no colour, red, or black are used in different traditions. Coloured hangings may be removed. Lutheran churches often either remove colourful adornments and icons, or veil them with drab cloth. The service is usually plain with somber music, ending with the congregation leaving in silence. In the Roman Catholic, some Lutheran, and High Anglican rites, a crucifix (not necessarily the one which stands on or near the altar on other days of the year) is ceremoniously unveiled. Other crucifixes are unveiled, without ceremony, after the service.

[[Holy Saturday]] commemorates the day during which Christ lay in the tomb. In the Roman Catholic Church, there is no Mass on this day; the Easter Vigil Mass, which, though celebrated properly at the following midnight, is often celebrated in the evening, is an Easter Mass. With no liturgical celebration, there is no question of a liturgical colour.

The [[Easter Vigil]] is held in the night between Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday, to celebrate the [[resurrection]] of Jesus. See also [[Paschal candle]]. The liturgical colour is white, often together with gold. In the Roman Rite, during the "Gloria in Excelsis Deo" the organ and bells are used in the liturgy for the first time in 2 days, and the statues, which have been veiled during Passiontide (at least in the Roman Rite through the 1962 version), are unveiled. In Lutheran churches, colours and icons are re-displayed as well.
{{Roman Catholicism}}

====Eastertide====
{{Main article|Eastertide}}

[[Easter]] is the celebration of [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|Jesus' resurrection]]. The date of Easter varies from year to year, according to a lunar-calendar dating system (see [[computus]] for details). In the Roman Rite, the Easter season extends from the [[Easter Vigil]] through [[Pentecost]] Sunday. In the pre-1970 form of the rite, this season includes also the [[Octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of Pentecost, so Eastertide lasts until [[None (liturgy)|None]] of the following Saturday.

In the Roman Rite, the [[Easter octave]] allows no other feasts to be celebrated or commemorated during it; a solemnity, such as the Annunciation, falling within it is transferred to the following Monday. If Easter Sunday or Easter Monday falls on 25 April, the Greater Litanies, which in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite are on that day, are transferred to the following Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maternalheart.org/library/1962rubrics.pdf 1960 Code of Rubrics], 80&lt;/ref&gt;

By a decree of May 5, 2000, the Second Sunday of Easter (the Sunday after Easter Day itself), is known also in the Roman Rite as the [[Feast of the Divine Mercy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osv.com/tabid/7631/itemid/5968/Feast-of-the-Divine-Mercy.aspx Our Sunday Visitor: Feast of the Divine Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] Thursday, which celebrates the return of Jesus to heaven following his resurrection, is the fortieth day of Easter, but, in places where it is not observed as a [[Holy Day of Obligation]], the post-1969 form of the Roman rite transfers it to the following Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/litcal.htm General Norms for the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 7 and 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pentecost]] is the fiftieth and last day of the Easter season. It celebrates the sending of the [[Holy Spirit]] to the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]], which traditionally marks the birth of the Church, see also [[Apostolic Age]].

''Liturgical colour'': white, but red on the feast of Pentecost.

====Ordinary Time, Time after Pentecost, Time after Trinity, or Kingdomtide====
{{Main article|Ordinary Time|Kingdomtide}}
This season, under various names, follows the Easter season and the feasts of Easter, Ascension, and Pentecost. In the post-1969 form of the Roman rite, Ordinary Time resumes on [[Pentecost Monday]], omitting the Sunday which would have fallen on Pentecost. In the earlier form, where Pentecost is celebrated with an octave, the Time after Pentecost begins at Vespers on the Saturday after Pentecost. The Sundays resume their numbering at the point that will make the Sunday before Advent the thirty-fourth, omitting any weeks for which there is no room (present-day form of the Roman Rite) or are numbered as "Sundays after Pentecost" (pre-1970 Roman Rite, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and some Protestants) or as "Sundays after Trinity" (some Protestants). This season ends on the Saturday before the First Sunday of Advent.

Feasts during this season include:
* [[Trinity Sunday]], the first Sunday after Pentecost.
* [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] (Roman Rite and some Anglican and Lutheran traditions), Thursday of the second week after Pentecost, often celebrated on the following Sunday.
* Solemnity of the [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus (Roman Rite), Friday in the third week after Pentecost.
* [[World Day of the Poor]], 33rd Sunday of Ordinary Time.
* [[Feast of Christ the King]], last Sunday before Advent (Roman Rite, Lutherans, Anglicans) or last Sunday in October (1925–1969 form of the Roman Rite).

In the final few weeks of Ordinary Time, many churches direct attention to the coming of the Kingdom of God, thus ending the liturgical year with an [[eschatology|eschatological]] theme that is one of the predominant themes of the season of Advent that began the liturgical year. For instance, in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite, the Gospel of the Last Sunday is {{bibleverse||Matthew|24:15–35}} and in the later form of that rite all the last three Sundays have similar themes.

While the Roman Rite adopts no special designation for this final part of Ordinary Time, some denominations do, and may also change the liturgical colour. The [[Church of England]] uses the term "Sundays before Advent" for the final four Sundays and permits red vestments as an alternative. Other denominations, including the [[United Methodist Church]] and the [[Synod of Saint Timothy|Christian Church - Synod of Saint Timothy]], speak of "[[Kingdomtide]]". The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) uses the terms "Third-Last, Second-Last and Last Sunday in the Church Year" and does not change from green. The LCMS does not officially celebrate a "Feast of Christ the King." The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) uses the term "Period of End Times" and assigns red vestments to the first and second Sundays.

====Calendar of saints====
{{Main article|Calendar of saints}}
* In some Protestant traditions, especially those with closer ties to the Lutheran tradition, [[Reformation Day|Reformation Sunday]] is celebrated on the Sunday preceding October 31, commemorating the purported day [[Martin Luther]] posted the [[95 Theses]] on the door of the Castle Church in [[Wittenberg]]. The liturgical colour is red, celebrating the [[Holy Spirit]]'s continuing work in renewing the Church.
* Most Western traditions celebrate [[All Saints' Day]] (All Hallow's Day) on November 1 or the Sunday following, with the eve of this feast, [[All Hallow's Eve]] being October 31. The liturgical colour is white. The following day, November 2, is [[All Souls' Day]]. The period including these days is often referred to as [[Allhallowtide]]  or Allsaintstide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Saints' Tide|url=http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/pohg/s2a.html|website=Services and Prayers for the Season from All Saints to Candlemas|publisher=[[General Synod of the Church of England]]|quote=For many twentieth-century Christians the All Saints-tide period is extended to include Remembrance Sunday.

* Some traditions celebrate [[Martinmas|St. Martin's Day]] (Martinmas) on November 11.

''Liturgical colours'': white if the saint was not martyred; red if the saint was martyred

=====Hierarchy of feast days=====
{{Main article|Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|Principal Holy Day (Anglicanism)}}
There are degrees of solemnity of the office of the feast days of saints. In the 13th century, the Roman Rite distinguished three ranks: simple, semidouble and double, with consequent differences in the recitation of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office or Breviary]]. The simple feast commenced with the chapter (''capitulum'') of First Vespers, and ended with None. It had three lessons and took the psalms of Matins from the ferial office; the rest of the office was like the semidouble. The semidouble feast had two Vespers, nine lessons in Matins, and ended with Compline. The antiphons before the psalms were only intoned. In the Mass, the semidouble had always at least three "orationes" or [[collect]]s. On a double feast the antiphons were sung in their entirety, before and after the psalms, while in Lauds and Vespers there were no ''suffragia'' of the saints, and the Mass had only one "oratio" (if no commemoration was prescribed). If ordinary double feasts (referred to also as lesser doubles) occurred with feasts of a higher rank, they could be simplified, except the octave days of some feasts and the feasts of the Doctors of the Church, which were transferred.

To the existing distinction between major and ordinary or minor doubles, [[Pope Clement VIII]] added two more ranks, those of first-class or second-class doubles. Some of these two classes were kept with octaves. This was still the situation when the 1907 article [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06021b.htm Ecclesiastical Feasts] in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] was written. In accordance with the rules then in force, feast days of any form of double, if impeded by "occurrence" (falling on the same day)&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.newadvent.org/cathen/11200a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. Occurrence (in liturgy)]&lt;/ref&gt; with a feast day of higher class, were transferred to another day.

[[Pope Pius X]] simplified matters considerably in his 1911 [[Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X|reform of the Roman Breviary]]. In the case of occurrence the lower-ranking feast day could become a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] within the celebration of the higher-ranking one. Until then, ordinary doubles took precedence over most of the semidouble Sundays, resulting in many of the Sunday Masses rarely being said. While retaining the semidouble rite for Sundays, Pius X's reform permitted only the most important feast days to be celebrated on Sunday, although commemorations were still made until [[Pope John XXIII]]'s reform of 1960.

The division into doubles (of various kinds) semidoubles and simples continued until 1955, when [[Pope Pius XII]] abolished the rank of semidouble, making all the previous semidoubles simples, and reducing the previous simples to a mere commemoration in the Mass of another feast day or of the feria on which they fell (see [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]]).

Then, in 1960, Pope John XXIII issued the [[Code of Rubrics]], completely ending the ranking of feast days by doubles etc., and replacing it by a ranking, applied not only to feast days but to all liturgical days, as I, II, III, and IV class days.

The [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] divided feast days into "solemnities", "feasts" and "memorials", corresponding approximately to Pope John XXIII's I, II and III class feast days. Commemorations were abolished. While some of the memorials are considered obligatory, others are optional, permitting a choice on some days between two or three memorials, or between one or more memorials and the celebration of the feria. On a day to which no obligatory celebration is assigned, the Mass may be of any saint mentioned in the [[Roman Martyrology]] for that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal], 355 c&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Assumption of Mary=====
{{Main article|Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary}}

Observed by Roman Catholics and some Anglicans on August 15, which is the same as the Eastern and Orthodox feast of the [[Dormition]], the end of the earthly life of the Virgin Mary and, for some, her bodily Assumption into heaven, is celebrated. The Roman Catholic teaching on this feast was defined as [[dogma]] on November 1, 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the [[Papal Bull]], ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''.

In other Anglican and Lutheran traditions, as well as a few others, August 15 is celebrated as St. Mary, Mother of the Lord.

''Liturgical colour'': white

==Secular observance==
Because of the dominance of Christianity in Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]], many features of the Christian year became incorporated into the secular calendar. Many of its feasts (e.g., [[Christmas]], [[Mardi Gras]], [[Saint Patrick's Day]]) remain holidays, and are now celebrated by people of all faiths and none — in some cases worldwide. The secular celebrations bear varying degrees of likeness to the religious feasts from which they derived, often also including elements of ritual from [[Paganism|pagan]] festivals of similar date.

'''Mechanically stabilized earth''' ('''MSE''' or '''reinforced soil''') is [[soil]] constructed with artificial reinforcing. It can be used for [[retaining walls]], [[bridge]] abutments, [[seawall]]s, and [[dike (construction)|dikes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tc17.poly.edu/mse.htm |title=Mechanically Stabilized Earth Structures |accessdate=2007-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216144152/http://tc17.poly.edu/mse.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/structures/Manuals/mse.pdf| title=Mechanically Stabilized Earth Wall Inspector's Handbook |work=[[Florida Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the basic principles of MSE have been used throughout history, MSE was developed in its current form in the 1960s. The reinforcing elements used can vary but include [[steel]] and [[geosynthetic]]s.

MSE is the term usually used in the US to distinguish it from the trade name "Reinforced Earth". Elsewhere "reinforced soil" is the generally accepted term.

==Description==

MSE walls stabilize unstable slopes and retain the soil on steep slopes and under crest loads. The wall face is often of precast, segmental blocks, panels or [[geocells]] that can tolerate some differential movement. The walls are infilled with granular soil, with or without reinforcement, while retaining the backfill soil. Reinforced walls utilize horizontal layers typically of [[geogrids]]. The reinforced soil mass, along with the facing, forms the wall. In many types of MSE’s, each vertical fascia row is inset, thereby providing individual cells that can be infilled with topsoil and planted with vegetation to create a [[green wall]].

The main advantages of MSE walls compared to conventional reinforced concrete walls are their ease of installation and quick construction. They do not require formwork or curing and each layer is structurally sound as it is laid, reducing the need for support, scaffolding or cranes. They also do not require additional work on the facing.

In addition to the flexibility of MSE walls in design and construction, seismic testing conducted on a large scale shaking table laboratory at the Japan National Institute of Agricultural Engineering (Tsukuba City), showed that modular block reinforced walls,&lt;ref&gt;Ling, H.I., Mohri Y, Leshchinsky, D., Burke, C., Matsushima, K., Liu, H. (2005). Large-Scale Shaking Table Tests on Modular-Block Reinforced Soil Retaining Walls. Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering © ASCE (April), 465-476.&lt;/ref&gt; and even more so [[Geocells|geocell]] retention walls,&lt;ref&gt;Leshchinsky, D. (2009) “Research and Innovation: Seismic Performance of Various Geocell Earth-retention Systems,” Geosysnthetics, No. 27, No. 4, 46-52&lt;/ref&gt; retain sufficient flexibility to withstand large deformations without loss of structural integrity, and have high seismic load resistance. Highway overpasses along interstates often employ the [[INTER-LOK System]].

==History==

Using straw, sticks, and branches to reinforce [[adobe brick]]s and mud dwellings has happened since the earliest part of [[human history]], and in the 1970s [[France|French]] [[engineer]] [[Sir Henri Vidal]] invented the modern form of MSE, he termed Terre Armee (reinforced earth). In his submission for his patents he covered every possible reinforcement and facing type. Reinforcing levees with branches has been done in [[China]] for at least a thousand years, and other reinforcements have been universally used to prevent soil [[erosion]]. Modern use of soil reinforcing for retaining wall construction was pioneered by French architect and engineer Henri Vidal in the 1960s. The first MSE wall in the [[United States]] was built in 1971 on [[California State Route 39|State Route 39]] near [[Los Angeles]]. It is estimated that since 1997, approximately 23,000 MSE walls have been constructed in the world.
==Reinforcement==

Reinforcement placed in horizontal layers throughout the height of the wall provides the tensile strength to hold the soil together. The reinforcement materials of MSE can vary. Originally, long steel strips 50 to 120&amp;nbsp;mm (2 to 5&amp;nbsp;in) wide were used as reinforcement. These strips are sometimes ripped, although not always, to provide added friction. There are also prefabricated pile sleeve options to reduce negative skin friction on piles embedded behind MSE bridge abutments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foundationtechnologies.com/products/yellow-jacket-brochure/|title=Yellow Jacket Brochure|work=Foundation Technologies, Inc.|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes steel grids or meshes are also used as reinforcement. Several types of geosynthetics can be used including [[geogrid]]s and [[geotextile]]s. The reinforcing geosynthetics can be made of [[high-density polyethylene]], [[polyester]], and [[polypropylene]]. These materials may be ribbed and are available in various sizes and strengths.&lt;ref name="FHWA guidelines"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mechanically Stabilized Earth Walls And Reinforced Soil Slopes: Design &amp; Construction Guidelines |work=[[FHWA]] |date=March 2001 |url=http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/FHWA/010567.pdf |accessdate=2007-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For erosion control and load support the upper layer can be reinforced by [[cellular confinement|geocell]] materials.

[[Image:MiddleAmericaTrench.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The trench is colored in dark blue]]
[[Image:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|300px|The trench lies at the convergence of the, [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]], [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]], [[North American Plate|North American]], and [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] plates]]

The '''Middle America Trench''' is a major [[subduction zone]], an [[oceanic trench]] in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] off the southwestern coast of [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]], stretching from central [[Mexico]] to [[Costa Rica]].  The trench is 1,700 miles (2,750&amp;nbsp;km) long and is 21,880 feet (6,669 m) at its deepest point.
The trench is the boundary between the [[Rivera Plate|Rivera]], [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]], and [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]] plates on one side and the [[North American Plate|North American]] and [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] plates on the other. It is the 18th-deepest trench in the world. Many large earthquakes have occurred in the area of the Middle America Trench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.|last=Astiz|first2=H.|last2=Kanamori|authorlink2=Hiroo Kanamori|first3=H.|last3=Eissler|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/49188/|title=Source characteristics of earthquakes in the Michoacan seismic gap in Mexico|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America |year=1987 |volume=77|issue=4 |pages=1326–1346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Division==
The Middle America Trench can be divided into a northern and a southern section. The division, however, is not the same in its seaward side and its landward side. In the seaward side, the northern section, called the Acapulco Trench, runs from [[Jalisco]] to the [[Tehuantepec Ridge]], and the southern section, called the Guatemala Trench, runs from the Tehuantepec Ridge to the Cocos Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.revistas.unam.mx/index.php/geofisica/article/download/39775/36200|title=Sediment Fill In the Middle America Trench Inferred From Gravity Anomalies|journal=Geofisica Internacional|volume=42 |year=2003|pages=603–612|author1=Marina Manea |author2=Vlad C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9971">The '''multipactor effect''' is a phenomenon in [[radio-frequency]] (RF) [[amplifier]] [[vacuum tube]]s and [[waveguide]]s, where, under certain conditions, secondary [[electron]] emission in resonance with an alternating electric field leads to exponential electron multiplication, possibly damaging and even destroying the RF device.

==Description==
[[File:Multipaction in coaxial connector.gif|thumb|frameless|Simulation of coxial multipactor. The electron cloud moves between the inner and outer conductor in resonance, causing an [[electron avalanche]]: in 5 nanoseconds, the number of electrons increases 150×.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Update on Multipactor in Coaxial Waveguides Using CST Particle Studio|first=Gennady|last=Romanov|url=https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/PAC2011/papers/tup008.pdf|journal=Proceedings of 2011 Particle Accelerator Conference|year=2011|page=2|quote=Simulations  of  electron multipactor discharge in the coaxial waveguide have been performed using CST Particle Studio, with a primary goal to verify the effect of multi-particle approach combined with advanced probabilistic  emission model on the discharge thresholds.

The multipactor effect occurs when electrons accelerated by [[radio-frequency]] (RF) fields are self-sustained in a [[vacuum]] (or near vacuum) via an [[electron avalanche]] caused by [[secondary emission|secondary]] electron emission. The impact of an electron to a surface can, depending on its energy and angle, release one or more [[secondary electrons]] into the vacuum. These electrons can then be accelerated by the RF fields and impact with the same or another surface. Should the impact energies, number of electrons released, and timing of the impacts be such that a sustained multiplication of the number of electrons occurs, the phenomenon can grow exponentially and may lead to operational problems of the RF system such as damage of RF components or loss or distortion of the RF signal.

==Mechanism==
The mechanism of multipactor depends on the orientation of an RF electric field with respect to the surface. There are two types of multipactor: two-surface multipactor on metals and single-surface multipactor on dielectrics.

===Two-surface multipactor on metals===
This is a multipactor effect that occurs in the gap between metallic electrodes. Often, an RF electric field is normal to the surface. A [[resonance]] between electron flight time and RF field cycle is a mechanism for multipactor development.

The existence of multipactor is dependent on the following three conditions being met: The average number of electrons released is greater than or equal to one per incident electron (this is dependent on the [[secondary electron yield]] of the surface) ''and'' the time taken by the electron to travel from the surface from which it was released to the surface it impacts with is an integer multiple of one half of the RF period ''and'' the average secondary electron yield is greater than or equal to one.

===Single-surface multipactor on dielectrics===
This is a multipactor effect that occurs on a dielectric surface. Often, an RF electric field is parallel to the surface. The positive charge accumulated on the dielectric surface attracts electrons back to the surface. A single-surface multipactor event is also possible on a metallic surface in the presence of a crossed static magnetic field.

==Frequency-gap product in two-surface multipactor==
The conditions under which multipactor will occur in two surface multipactor can be described by a quantity called the frequency-gap product. Consider a two surface setup with the following definitions:
:&lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt;, distance or gap between the surfaces 
:&lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt;, angular frequency of the RF field
:&lt;math&gt; V_0 &lt;/math&gt;, peak plate-to-plate RF voltage
:&lt;math&gt; E_0 &lt;/math&gt;, peak electric field between the surfaces, equal to &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

The RF voltage varies sinusoidally. Consider the time at which the voltage at electrode A passes through 0 and starts to become negative. Assuming that there is at least 1 free electron near A, that electron will begin to accelerate to the right toward electrode B. It will continue to accelerate and reach a maximum velocity ½ of a cycle later just as the voltage at electrode B begins to become negative. If the electron(s) from electrode A strike electrode B at this time and produce additional free electrons, these new free electrons will begin to accelerate toward electrode A. The process may then repeat causing multipactor. We now find the relationship between the plate spacing, RF frequency, and RF voltage that causes the strongest multipactor resonance.

Consider a point in time at which electrons have just collided with electrode A at position -d/2. The electric field is at zero and is beginning to point to the left so that the newly freed electrons are accelerated toward the right. Newton’s equation of motion of the free electrons is
:&lt;math&gt; a(t)=\frac{F(t)}{m} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{x}(t) = \frac{qE_0}{m}~\sin(\omega t) &lt;/math&gt;

The solution to this differential equation is
:&lt;math&gt; x(t) = -\frac{qE_0}{m \omega^2}\sin(\omega t) + \frac{qE_0}{m \omega}t - \frac{d}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
where we’ve assumed that when the electrons initially leave the electrode they have zero velocity. We know that resonance happens if the electrons arrive at the rightmost electrode after one half of the period of the RF field, &lt;math&gt; t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{\pi}{\omega} &lt;/math&gt;. Plugging this into our solution for &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; we get
:&lt;math&gt; x(t_{\frac{1}{2}}) = -\frac{qE_0}{m \omega^2}\sin(\omega t_{\frac{1}{2}}) + \frac{qE_0}{m \omega} t_{\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{d}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{2} = -\frac{qE_0}{m \omega^2}\sin(\omega \frac{\pi}{\omega}) + \frac{qE_0}{m \omega} \frac{\pi}{\omega} - \frac{d}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging and using the frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; instead of the angular frequency gives
:&lt;math&gt; fd = \frac{1}{2\sqrt\pi}\sqrt \frac{qV_0}{m}&lt;/math&gt;.

The product &lt;math&gt; fd &lt;/math&gt; is called the frequency-gap product. Keep in mind that this equation is a criterion for greatest amount of resonance, but multipactor can still occur when this equation is not satisfied.

==History==
This phenomenon was first observed by the French physicist [[Camille Gutton]], in 1924, at Nancy.

Multipactor was identified and studied in 1934 by [[Philo T. Farnsworth]], the inventor of electronic television, who attempted to take advantage of it as an amplifier. More commonly nowadays, it has become an obstacle to be avoided for normal operation of [[particle accelerator]]s, [[vacuum electronics]], [[radar]]s, [[satellite communication]] devices, and so forth. A novel form of multipactor has been proposed (Kishek, 1998), and subsequently experimentally observed, in which charging of a [[dielectric]] surface considerably changes the dynamics of the multipactor discharge.

'''Nanda Devi''' ({{Lang-hi|नन्दा देवी}})  is the second highest mountain in [[India]], and the highest located entirely within the country. ([[Kangchenjunga]], which is higher, is on the border of India and [[Nepal]].)  It is the 23rd-highest peak in the world. It was considered [[List of past presumed highest mountains|the highest mountain in the world]] before computations in 1808 proved [[Dhaulagiri]] to be higher. It was also the highest mountain in India before 1975 when [[Sikkim]], the state in which Kangchenjunga is located, joined the Republic of India. It is part of the [[Garhwal Himalaya]]s, and is located in  [[Chamoli]] district of [[Uttarakhand]], between the Rishiganga valley on the west and the Goriganga valley on the east. The peak, whose name means "Bliss-Giving Goddess",&lt;ref name="him_alpine_style"/&gt; is regarded as the patron-goddess of the [[Uttarakhand]] Himalaya. In acknowledgment of its religious significance and for the protection of its fragile ecosystem, the peak as well as the circle of high mountains surrounding it—the Nanda Devi sanctuary—were closed to both locals and climbers in 1983. The surrounding [[Nanda Devi National Park]] was declared a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1988.

==Description and notable features==
Nanda Devi is a two-peaked [[massif]], forming a {{Convert|2|km|mi|1|adj=mid|-long}} high ridge, oriented east-west. The western summit is higher, and the eastern summit is called [[Sunanda Devi]] formerly known as ''Nanda Devi East'' is the lower one. The main summit stands guarded by a barrier ring comprising some of the highest mountains in the Indian Himalayas, twelve of which exceed {{convert|6400|m}} in height, further elevating its sacred status as the daughter of the Himalaya in Indian myth and folklore. The interior of this almost insurmountable ring is known as the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, and is protected as the [[Nanda Devi National Park]]. Sunanda Devi lies on the eastern edge of the ring (and of the Park), at the border of [[Chamoli]], [[Pithoragarh]] and [[Bageshwar]] districts.

Together the peaks may be referred to as the peaks of the goddesses Nanda and Sunanda. These goddesses have occurred together in ancient Sanskrit literature (Srimad Bhagvatam or [[Bhagavata Purana]]) and are worshipped together as twins in the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal division|Garhwal]] and as well as elsewhere in India. The first published reference to Nanda Devi East as Sunanda Devi appears to be in a recent novel (Malhotra 2011) that has the Kumaon region as backdrop.

In addition to being the [[List of highest mountains|23rd highest independent peak in the world]], Nanda Devi is also notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain. It rises over {{Convert|3300|m|ft|-2}} above its immediate southwestern base on the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier in about {{Convert|4.2|km|mi|1}}, and its rise above the glaciers to the north is similar. This makes it among the steepest peaks in the world at this scale, closely comparable, for example, to the local profile of [[K2]]. Nanda Devi is also impressive when considering terrain that is a bit further away, as it is surrounded by relatively deep valleys. For example, it rises over {{Convert|6500|m|ft|-2}} above the valley of the Goriganga in only {{Convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="garhwal-himalaya-ost"&gt;''Garhwal-Himalaya-Ost'', 1:150,000 scale topographic map, prepared in 1992 by Ernst Huber for the [[Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research]], based on maps of the [[Survey of India]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the northern side of the massif lies the Uttari Nanda Devi Glacier, flowing into the Uttari Rishi Glacier. To the southwest, one finds the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier, flowing into the Dakkhini Rishi Glacier. All of these glaciers are located within the Sanctuary, and drain west into the Rishiganga. To the east lies the Pachu Glacier, and to the southeast lie the Nandaghunti and Lawan Glaciers, feeding the Lawan Gad; all of these drain into the Milam Valley. To the south is the Pindari Glacier, draining into the Pindar River. Just to the south of Sunanda Devi, dividing the Lawan Gad drainage from the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier, is Longstaff [[Mountain pass|Col]], {{Convert|5910|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, one of the high passes that guard access to the Nanda Devi Sanctuary.&lt;ref name="garhwal-himalaya-ost"/&gt; For a list of notable peaks of the Sanctuary and its environs, see [[Nanda Devi National Park]].

==Exploration and climbing history==

{{main|Shipton–Tilman Nanda Devi expeditions}}
[[Image:Nanda-region-map-annotated.jpg|thumb|right|Shaded contour map of Nanda Devi region]]
The ascent of Nanda Devi necessitated fifty years of arduous exploration in search of a passage into the Sanctuary. The outlet is the Rishi Gorge, a deep, narrow canyon which is very difficult to traverse safely, and is the biggest hindrance to entering the Sanctuary; any other route involves difficult [[mountain pass|passes]], the lowest of which is {{Convert|5180|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. [[Hugh Ruttledge]] attempted to reach the peak three times in the 1930s and failed each time. In a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' he wrote that 'Nanda Devi imposes on her votaries an admission test as yet beyond their skill and endurance', adding that gaining entry to the Nanda Devi Sanctuary alone was more difficult than reaching the [[North Pole]].[http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/travel/0,6121,1201876,00.html]
In 1934, the British explorers [[Eric Shipton]] and [[Bill Tilman|H. W. Tilman]], with three [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] companions, [[Angtharkay]], Pasang, and Kusang, finally [[Shipton–Tilman Nanda Devi expeditions|discovered a way through the Rishi Gorge into the Sanctuary]].

When the mountain was later climbed in 1936 by a British-American expedition, it became the [[World altitude record (mountaineering)|highest peak climbed by man]] until the [[1950 French Annapurna expedition|1950 ascent of Annapurna]], {{Convert|8091|m|ft|0}}. (However higher non-summit elevations had already been reached by the British on [[Mount Everest]] in the 1920s, and it is possible that [[George Mallory]] [[1924 British Mount Everest expedition|reached Everest's summit in 1924]].) It also involved steeper and more sustained terrain than had been previously attempted at such a high altitude.&lt;ref name="him_alpine_style"/&gt; The expedition climbed the south ridge, also known as the Coxcomb Ridge, which leads relatively directly to the main summit.&lt;ref name="world_mountaineering"/&gt; The summit pair were [[Bill Tilman|H. W. Tilman]] and [[Noel Odell]]; [[Charles Snead Houston|Charles Houston]] was to be in place of Tilman, but he contracted severe food poisoning. Noted mountaineer and mountain writer [[H. Adams Carter]] was also on the expedition, which was notable for its small scale and lightweight ethic: it included only seven climbers, and used no [[fixed rope]]s, nor any [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] support above {{Convert|6200|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. Eric Shipton, who was not involved in the climb itself, called it "the finest mountaineering achievement ever performed in the Himalaya."&lt;ref name="him_alpine_style"/&gt;

After abortive attempts by Indian expeditions in 1957 and 1961, the second ascent of Nanda Devi was accomplished by an Indian team led by N. Kumar in 1964, following the Coxcomb route.

===CIA mission===

From 1965 to 1968, attempts were made by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), in co-operation with the [[Indian Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), to place a nuclear-powered telemetry relay listening device on the summit of Nanda Devi. This device was designed to intercept telemetry signals from missile test launches conducted in the [[Xinjiang]] Province, at a time of relative infancy in [[China's missile program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Vinod K. Jose |title=River Deep Mountain High |publisher=Caravan Magazine |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2013 |url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/river-deep-mountain-high}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition retreated due to dangerous weather conditions, leaving the device near the summit of Nanda Devi. They returned the next spring to search for the device, which ended without success. As a result of this activity by the CIA, the Sanctuary was closed to foreign expeditions throughout much of the 1960s. In 1974 the Sanctuary re-opened.

===Subsequent climbs===

[[File:Nanda Devi from Kausani.JPG|thumb|right|The southwest side of Nanda Devi photographed from [[Kausani]]]]
A difficult new route, the northwest buttress, was climbed by a 13-person team in 1976. Three Americans, John Roskelley, Jim States, and [[Louis Reichardt]], summitted on 1 September. The expedition was co-led by Reichardt, [[H. Adams Carter]] (who was on the 1936 climb), and [[Willi Unsoeld]], who climbed the West Ridge of Everest in 1963. Unsoeld's daughter, Nanda Devi Unsoeld, who was named after the peak, died on this expedition.&lt;ref name="ndu"&gt;J. Roskelley, ''Nanda Devi: The Tragic Expedition'' (The Mountaineers Books, 2000) {{ISBN|0-89886-739-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Alpine Journal]]'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been suffering from "diarrhea and flare-up of an [[inguinal hernia]], which had shown up originally on the second day of the approach march", and had been at {{convert|7200|m|ft}} for nearly five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://footlesscrow.blogspot.com/2013/04/darkness-at-noonthe-life-and-death-of.html|title=Darkness at Noon: The life and death of Nanda Devi Unsoeld |author=Unsoeld, Willie|work=
THE AMERICAN ALPINE JOURNAL |date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers]] made an unsuccessful attempt.

In 1981, the first women stood on the summit as part of a mixed Indian team, led by Col. Balwant Sandhu, Rekha Sharma, Harshwanti Bisht and [[Chandraprabha Aitwal]], partnered by Dorjee Lhatoo, Ratan Singh and Sonam Paljor respectively, climbed on three ropes and summitted consecutively. The expedition was notable for the highest ascent ever made by Indian women up to that point in time, a descent complicated by retinal oedema and vision loss in the climbing leader and a subsequent failed claim of a solo ascent by a later member of the same expedition. All three women went on to Everest in 1984 but did not make the summit although Sonam Paljor and Dorjee Lhatoo did. Dorjee Lhatoo climbed Sunanda Devi in 1975, she also participated in the 1976 Indo-Japanese expedition.

This was followed in 1981 by another Indian Army expedition of the Parachute Regiment, which attempted both main and eastern peaks simultaneously. The expedition had placed a memorial to Nanda Devi Unsoeld at the high altitude meadow of Sarson Patal prior to the attempt. The successful attempt lost all its summitteers.

In 1993, a 40-member team of the Indian Army from the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] was given special permission. The aim of the expedition was multifold – to carry out an ecological survey, clean up the garbage left by previous expeditions, and attempt the summit. The team included a number of wildlife scientists and ecologists from [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [http://www.sacon.org/ Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History], [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [http://gbpihed.gov.in/ Govind Ballabh Pant Institute for Himalayan Environment and Development] amongst others. The expedition carried out a comprehensive ecological survey and removed from the park, by porter and helicopter, over 1000 kilograms of garbage. Additionally, five summiteers scaled the summit: Amin Nayak, Anand Swaroop, G. K. Sharma, Didar Singh, and S. P. Bhatt.&lt;ref name="sanan"&gt;Sanan, Deepak (1995) ''Nandadevi – Restoring Glory'' Sapper Adventure Foundation &amp; Wiley Eastern Limited {{ISBN|81-224-0752-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history and conservation==
After the re-opening of the sanctuary in 1974 to foreign climbers, trekkers, and locals, the fragile ecosystem was soon compromised by firewood cutting, garbage, and grazing. Serious environmental problems were noted as early as 1977, and the sanctuary was closed again in 1983.&lt;ref name="world_mountaineering"/&gt; Currently, Nanda Devi forms the core of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (which includes [[Nanda Devi National Park]]), declared by the Indian government in 1982. In 1988, Nanda Devi National Park was declared a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], "of outstanding [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage|natural]] importance to the common heritage of [[humankind]]."&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=335 Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks – UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The entire sanctuary, and hence the main summit (and interior approaches to the nearby peaks), are off-limits to locals and to climbing expeditions, though a one-time exception was made in 1993 for a 40-member team from the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers]] to check the state of recovery and to remove garbage left by prior expeditions.&lt;ref name="sanan"/&gt; Sunanda Devi remains open from the east side, leading to the standard south ridge route.

The '''National Museum''' ({{lang-ms|Muzium Negara}}) is a museum located on [[Jalan Damansara]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. The museum is situated in close proximity to the Perdana [[Lake Gardens, Kuala Lumpur|Lake Gardens]] and it provides an overview of Malaysian [[History of Malaysia|history]] and [[Culture of Malaysia|culture]]. The National Museum is a palatial structure built in the style of [[Rumah Gadang]], an aspect of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] architecture. Its facade comprises elements of traditional Malay and modern features. It was opened on 31 August 1963,&lt;ref name="TourismMY"&gt;{{cite web|title=Muzium Negara|url=http://www.tourism.gov.my/en/my/web-page/places/states-of-malaysia/kuala-lumpur/muzium-negara?page=/4|publisher=Tourism Malaysia|accessdate=25 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525201204/http://www.tourism.gov.my/en/my/web-page/places/states-of-malaysia/kuala-lumpur/muzium-negara?page=%2F4|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it serves as a repository of Malaysia's rich cultural and historical heritage.

The National Museum is a three-storey structure {{convert|109.7|m|ftin}} long and {{convert|15.1|m|ftin}} wide, which is {{convert|37.6|m|ftin}} high at the central point. The museum houses four main galleries allotted to ethnology and natural history. The displays range from free-standing [[wikt:tableau|tableaux]] showing cultural events like weddings, festivals and costumes; to traditional weapons, musical instruments, arts and crafts, ceramics, and flora and fauna.

== History ==
[[File:Selangor Museum.jpg|thumb|left|The old Selangor Museum]]
The National Museum was established on the site of the former ''Selangor Museum''.&lt;ref name="TourismMY"/&gt; It was built by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Selangor]] governments in 1898 following the formation of the [[Federated Malay States]] in 1896. On 10 March 1945, during the end of [[World War II]], the right wing of the museum was bombed and destroyed by the [[B-29 Superfortress|US B-29 bomber]], from the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welcome-kl.com/muzium-negara-national-museum/ |title=Muzium Negara |publisher=welcome-kl.com |accessdate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209183534/http://www.welcome-kl.com/muzium-negara-national-museum/ |archivedate=9 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's collection was then moved to the [[Perak State Museum|Perak Museum]] in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]].

After World War II, the left wing of Selangor Museum was still in use as a historical site. On the brink of the independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman conceived the idea to build a museum to house national historical and cultural treasures as well as specimens of flora and fauna. The old museum structure was completely demolished to make way for a new museum.

Construction began in 1959 and was complete in 1963. The National Museum was officially opened on 31 August 1963 by Tuanku Syed [[Putra of Perlis|Putra Ibni al-Marhum Syed Hassan Jamalullal]], the 3rd [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitkl.gov.my/tarheritagepark/muzium_negara.html |title=Muzium Negara |publisher=Kuala Lumpur City Hall |accessdate=16 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607084208/http://www.visitkl.gov.my/tarheritagepark/muzium_negara.html |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 1996 the building was gazetted under the Antiquities Act 169/1976 as an ancient monument and historical site.

[[File:National Museum KL 2008 interior pano.jpg|thumb|View into the main hall]]
The museum's design by architect [[Ho Kok Hoe]] was inspired by the architecture of the Malay royal palaces and vernacular Malay architecture. The design incorporated the need for exhibition and activity spaces. The large mosaic murals spanning the entrance depict the history and culture of the country. The floor of the central section of the main building is decorated with special tiles which were gifts from the government of Pakistan. In addition, UNESCO facilitated consultancies by museum experts from other museums around the world.

Displays and exhibits in the museum focus on local [[history]], [[culture]] and [[tradition]]s, [[arts]] and [[crafts]], economic activities, local [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], [[weapons]] and [[currency]].

The museum houses various galleries, each with its own theme. The ground floor showcases the geographic and natural history of the Malay peninsula starting with the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms to Muslim sultanate of Malacca. The ancient Malay [[Hindu]]–[[Buddhist]] states of [[Gangga Negara]], [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] are referenced. Among the collections are the stone makara statue, the bronze [[Avalokiteshvara]] of [[Bidor]], the model of [[Bujang Valley]] temple in Kedah, and also displaying region's ancient legacy such as Javan [[Borobudur]] and Majapahit vessel. The exhibit continues to the later Muslim [[Sultanate of Malacca]] and the various states of Malaysia. The display demonstrate the importance of Malaccan sultanate for Malaysian national identity. The second floor is dedicated to the colonial history leading all the way to [[Hari Merdeka|Independence]]. There are copies of the royal headgear of Malay rulers.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Selangor Museum Old.jpg|thumb|left|The old Selangor Museum]] --&gt;

=== Central Hall ===
Adorning the floor of the Central Hall are blue geometric-design mosaic tiles from Pakistan, with intricate carved panels on the ceiling of the hall. The Central Hall houses temporary exhibitions. Thematic and special exhibitions are held at this hall at intervals to promote an awareness of the country's diverse culture and heritage. Foreign exhibitions are held occasionally.

Some of the exhibitions that were held in this hall at some point of time included 'The Islamic Civilization', 'Our King', 'The World of Flowers', 'Durian King of Fruits', 'Masks from Sarawak', 'World Currency', 'Islamic Frontiers of China', 'American Frontiers', and 'Religious Architecture from the Netherlands'.

The museum places strong emphasis on the Malay World, and a considerable section is devoted to the founding of the United Malay National Organisation, one of the parties of the National Front (Barisan Nasional). Few if at all were any mentions made of the involvement of the Malayan Chinese Association and the Malayan Indian Congress, which three parties worked together to achieve Independence of Malaya on 31 August 1957.

Other galleries include the National Sports Gallery and the Natural History Gallery.

In the vicinity of the museum building, there are a number of outdoor displays of transportation in Malaysia, past and present. An interesting exhibit is the Melaka Bullock Cart which closely resembles the early American horse-drawn wagon. Of unparalleled interest are the Steam Locomotive made by [[Kitson and Company|Kitson &amp; Co]], England, which was put into service in 1921 until it ceased operation in 1969. It covered 1.5 million rail miles; a Tin Dredge which resembles a floating factory, on a natural or artificial lake. Also on display are motorised vehicles, including antiqued civic vehicles and private vehicles, including an early 1.3 litre [[Proton Saga]], the first national car launched on July 9th 1985.

National Museum also holds regular thematic exhibitions featuring specific aspects of life and world culture.

=== Istana Satu ===
[[File:National Museum KL 2008 Istana pano.jpg|thumb|Istana Satu]]
Another attraction of the museum is an original-size old Terengganu timber palace known as Istana Satu. It was erected by Sultan [[Zainal Abidin III]], [[Sultan of Terengganu]] in 1884 in the compound of Kota [[Istana Maziah]], [[Kuala Terengganu]]. This building is of Terengganu Malay traditional architecture, in the form called "Rumah Tiang Dua Belas". The wood used is [[cengal]]. Istana Satu was erected in the National Museum compound in April 1974.

Rich Malay craftsmanship is evident throughout the palace, from the intricate wood carvings that adorn doors and windows. The restored palace is a charming wooden house designed for the tropics. Standing on stilts that allow air to circulate freely under the building, the palace's steep thatch roof contributes further to keeping the interior of the house nice and cool.

Standing majestically next to the Istana Satu are two keliriengs or burial poles. A kelirieng is made of a huge hardwood tree trunk, carved from the top to bottom. Niched up to its sides is a space for the bodies of slaves and followers and hollowed at the top to place the jar containing the chief's bones.

=== The Orang Asli Crafts Museum ===
Visitors who want to learn about the original inhabitants of Malaysia should visit the Orang Asli Craft Museum. The museum showcases the arts and handicrafts of the Orang Asli people, the aboriginal communities who dwell mostly in rural areas across the Malaysian Peninsula. The museum explains how there are 18 different tribes of Orang Asli divided into 3 main groups, the Negrito, the Senai and the Proto Malay. The Orang Asli are famed for their handicrafts, particularly the wood carving skills by the Mah Meri and Jah Hut tribes who like to carve masks and figures and these are highly valued by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographs of the museum|url=https://independent-travellers.com/malaysia/kuala_lumpur/national_museum/|publisher=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Museum Volunteer Malaysia (MVM) ==
In 2007 cultural and history enthusiasts residing in the greater Kuala Lumpur area formed, with the support of the Department of National Museums, a group of volunteer museum tour guides to accommodate the growing number of international tourists to the museum. At any time, somewhere between 20 and 100 volunteers of many nationalities provide tours in English, Japanese, and French. A related group was established for Malaysian visitors, operating primarily on weekends.

Apart from tour-guide activities, MVM is active in promoting Malaysian cultural and historical heritage in schools and organising tours for members to places around Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia, such as a visit to Kuala Kangsar and Georgetown, [[Kuala Gandah Elephant Sanctuary]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pahangtourism.com.my/tropical/attractions/kgandah.html Kuala Gandah Elephant Sanctuary (Temerloh)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618103126/http://www.pahangtourism.com.my/tropical/attractions/kgandah.html |date=18 June 2011 }}, Tourism Pahang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endemicguides.com/Kuala_Gandah.htm Kuala Gandah Elephant Sanctuary], Endemic Guides.&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Selangor in Setapak and celebrating the Hari Moyang in the Hma' Meri Orang Asli village in Pulau Carey. The group also organised talks and classes for the members and the public to safe-guard as well as introducing the rich cultural and historical heritage of the country.

In 2009, MVM organised the "Jom Main" Exhibition with the collaboration of National Museum, which revisits traditional games that children in Malaysia used to play.

==Public transportation==
Muzium Negara is situated just behind, and lends its name to, the underground {{KLRT color code|SBK|15}} [[Muzium Negara MRT station]]. Indirectly, the {{KLRT color code|KJ|15}}{{KLRT color code|KA|01}}{{KLRT color code|MR|1}} [[KL Sentral]] is located across Jalan Damansara. The Muzium Negara MRT station is connected to KL Sentral by a {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=on}} long walkway with four escalators.

A '''near-Earth object''' ('''NEO''') is any [[small Solar System body]] whose orbit can bring it into proximity with [[Earth]]. By convention, a Solar System body is a NEO if its closest approach to the Sun ([[Apsis|perihelion]]) is less than 1.3&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU).&lt;ref name="NEO-groups"/&gt; If a NEO's orbit crosses the Earth's and the object is larger than {{convert|140|meter|ft}} across, it is considered a [[potentially hazardous object]] (PHO).&lt;ref name="CHAPMAN04"/&gt; Most known PHOs and NEOs are [[asteroid]]s, but a small fraction are [[comet]]s.&lt;ref name="neo-jpl-stats" /&gt;

There are over 19,000 known [[#Near-Earth asteroids|near-Earth asteroids]] (NEAs), over a hundred short-period [[#Near-Earth comets|near-Earth comets]] (NECs),&lt;ref name="neo-jpl-stats" /&gt; and a number of solar-orbiting [[spacecraft]] and [[meteoroid]]s large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth. It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the Earth.&lt;ref name="BROWN02"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc97/75th/rm_essay.htm |title=The Call of Catastrophes |author=Richard Monastersky |work=Science News Online |date=March 1, 1997 |accessdate=2017-11-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040313165341/http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc97/75th/rm_essay.htm |archivedate=2004-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of greater awareness of the potential danger some of the [[asteroid]]s or [[comet]]s pose. When impacting the Earth, asteroids as small as 20 m cause sufficiently strong shock waves and heat to damage the local environment and populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rumpf|first=Clemens M.|last2=Lewis|first2=Hugh G.|last3=Atkinson|first3=Peter M.|date=2017-04-19|title=Asteroid impact effects and their immediate hazards for human populations|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/2017GL073191|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=44|issue=8|pages=3433–3440|doi=10.1002/2017gl073191|issn=0094-8276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger asteroids penetrate the atmosphere to the surface of the Earth, producing craters if they hit ground and [[tsunami]]s if water bodies are hit. It is in principle possible to deflect asteroids, and methods of mitigation are being researched.&lt;ref name="tsr20120514"/&gt;

Based on the orbit calculations of identified NEOs, their risk of future impact is assessed on two scales, the [[Torino scale]] and the more complex [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale|Palermo scale]], both of which rate a risk of any significance with values above 0. Some NEOs have had temporarily positive Torino or Palermo scale ratings after their discovery, but {{As of|2018|03|lc=y}}, more precise calculations based on subsequent observations led to a reduction of the rating to or below 0 in all cases.&lt;ref name="Current_Impact_Risks"/&gt;

Since 1998, the United States, the European Union, and other nations are scanning for NEOs in an effort called [[Spaceguard]].&lt;ref name="spaceguard-2004" /&gt; The initial US Congress mandate to NASA of cataloging at least 90% of NEOs that are at least {{convert|1|km}} in diameter, which would cause a global catastrophe in case of an impact with Earth, had been met by 2011.&lt;ref name="pia14734" /&gt; In later years, the survey effort has been expanded&lt;ref name="law-109-155"/&gt; to objects as small as about {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=on}} across,&lt;ref name="ETech"/&gt; which still have the potential for large-scale, though not global, damage.

Due to their Earth-like orbits and low surface gravity, NEOs are easy targets for spacecraft.&lt;ref name="USAToday-NEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired20130323"/&gt; {{As of|2018|08}}, five near-Earth comets&lt;ref name="TaskForceReport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeepImpactHartley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsci20160930"/&gt; and three near-Earth asteroids have been visited by spacecraft,&lt;ref name="Eros-NEAR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Itokawa-hayabusa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toutatis-Change"/&gt; and probes are en route to two more NEAs.&lt;ref name="SFN-Hayabusa2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="space-osiris"/&gt; Plans to mine NEAs commercially have been drafted by private companies.

The major technical astronomical definition for Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are small Solar System bodies with orbits around the Sun that by definition lie partly between 0.983 ([[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]]) and 1.3 (aphelion) [[astronomical unit]]s (AU; Sun–Earth distance) away from the Sun.&lt;ref name = "MorbidelliAstIII" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waszczak|first=Adam|last2=Prince|first2=Thomas A.|last3=Laher|first3=Russ|last4=Masci|first4=Frank|last5=Bue|first5=Brian|last6=Rebbapragada|first6=Umaa|last7=Barlow|first7=Tom|last8=Jason Surace|last9=Helou|first9=George|date=2017|title=Small Near-Earth Asteroids in the Palomar Transient Factory Survey: A Real-Time Streak-detection System|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1538-3873/129/i=973/a=034402|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|language=en|volume=129|issue=973|pages=034402|doi=10.1088/1538-3873/129/973/034402|issn=1538-3873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, NEOs are not necessarily currently near the Earth, but they can potentially approach the Earth relatively closely. However, the term is also used more flexibly sometimes, for example for objects in orbit around the Earth or quasi orbits,&lt;ReF&gt;[https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/earths-new-buddy-asteroid-not-space-junk]&lt;/ref&gt; which are while orbiting the Sun would be described as orbiting the Earth

When a NEO is detected, like all other small Solar System bodies, it is submitted to the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s (IAU's) [[Minor Planet Center]] (MPC) for cataloging. MPC maintains separate lists of confirmed NEOs and potential NEOs.&lt;ref name="MPC-NEO-confirm"&gt;{{cite web |title=The NEO Confirmation Page |publisher=IAU/MPC |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/NEO/toconfirm_tabular.html |accessdate=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orbits of some NEOs intersect that of the Earth, so they pose a collision danger.&lt;ref name="CHAPMAN04"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The hazard of near-Earth asteroid impacts on earth |author=Clark R.

For the asteroids among PHOs, the potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), MPC maintains a separate list.&lt;ref name="MPC-PHA-list"&gt;{{cite web |title=List Of The Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) |publisher=IAU/MPC |url=https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/t_phas.html |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEOs are also catalogued by two separate units of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]): the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS)&lt;ref name="neo-jpl-intro" /&gt; and the Solar System Dynamics Group.&lt;ref name="JPL-SSD-NEA"/&gt;

PHAs are currently defined based on parameters relating to their potential to approach the Earth dangerously closely.&lt;ref name="NEO-groups"/&gt; Mostly objects with an Earth [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] (MOID) of 0.05&amp;nbsp;AU or less and an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] of 22.0 or brighter (a rough indicator of large size) are considered PHAs. Objects that cannot approach closer to the Earth (i.e. MOID) than {{convert |0.05 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=on}}, or are smaller than about {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} in diameter (i.e. H = 22.0 with assumed [[albedo]] of 14%), are not considered PHAs.&lt;ref name="NEO-groups"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEO Basics.

== History of human awareness of NEOs ==
[[File:PSM V76 D020 Path of halley comet.png|thumb|1910 drawing of the path of Halley's Comet]]

The first near-Earth objects to be observed by humans were comets. Their extraterrestrial nature was recognised and confirmed only after [[Tycho Brahe]] tried to measure the distance of a comet through its [[parallax]] in 1577; and the periodicity of some comets was recognised in 1705, when [[Edmond Halley]] first published his orbit calculations for the returning object now known as [[Halley's Comet]].&lt;ref name="Halley-synopsis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Halley |first=Edmund |date=1705 |title=A synopsis of the astronomy of comets |url=https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/synopsisofastron00hall |location=London |publisher=John Senex |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201055040/https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/synopsisofastron00hall |archivedate=2017-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1758–1759 return of Halley's Comet was the first comet appearance predicted in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stoyan |first=Ronald |title=Atlas of Great Comets |date=2015 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAZEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101 |pages=101–103 |isbn=978-1-107-09349-2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301114413/https://books.google.com/books?id=WAZEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101 |archivedate=2018-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, asteroid [[69230 Hermes]] was discovered when it passed the Earth at twice the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance of the Moon]].&lt;ref name="RadarHermes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Radar observations of long-lost asteroid 1937 UB (Hermes) |work=Cornell University, Arecibo Observatory |url=http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~jlm/NEAs/Hermes/ |accessdate=2017-11-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524082001/http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~jlm/NEAs/Hermes/ |archivedate=2017-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes was considered a threat because it was lost after its discovery; thus its orbit and potential for collision with Earth were not known precisely.&lt;ref name="Marsden1998"/&gt; Hermes was re-discovered in 2003, and is now known to be no immediate threat.&lt;ref name="RadarHermes"/&gt;

=== Risk ===
[[File:Toutatis.jpg|thumb|Asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]] is a [[potentially hazardous object]] that has passed within 2.3 [[lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]]]]

From the late 1990s, a typical frame of reference in searches for NEOs has been the scientific concept of [[risk]]. The risk that any near-Earth object poses is viewed having regard to both the [[culture]] and the [[technology]] of [[human society]]. Through history, humans have associated NEOs with changing risks, based on religious, philosophical or scientific views, as well as humanity's technological or economical capability to deal with such risks.&lt;ref name="tsr20120514"&gt;

The potential of catastrophic impacts by near-Earth comets was recognised as soon as the first orbit calculations provided an understanding of their orbits: in 1694, Edmond Halley presented a theory that [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's flood]] in the [[Bible]] was caused by a comet impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jasoncolavito.com/halley-on-noahs-comet.html |title=Noah's Comet.

The awareness of the wider public of the impact risk rose after the observation of the impact of the fragments of [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] into Jupiter in July 1994.&lt;ref name="tsr20120514"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapman1998"/&gt; In 1998, the movies ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' and ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' popularised the notion that near-Earth objects could cause catastrophic impacts.&lt;ref name="Chapman1998"/&gt; Also at that time, a [[conspiracy theory]] arose about the supposed 2003 impact of the fictitious [[Nibiru cataclysm|planet Nibiru]], which persisted on the internet as the predicted impact date was moved to 2012 and then 2017.&lt;ref name="Molloy2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Molloy |first=Mark |title=Nibiru: How the nonsense Planet X Armageddon and Nasa fake news theories spread globally |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/21/nibiru-nonsense-planet-x-armageddon-nasa-fake-news-theories/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=September 22, 2017 |accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Risk scales ====

There are two schemes for the scientific classification of impact hazards from NEOs:
* the simple [[Torino scale]], which rates the risks of impacts in the next 100 years according to impact energy and impact probability, using integer numbers between 0 and 10;&lt;ref name="torino"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/torino_scale.html |title=Torino Impact Hazard Scale |publisher=NASA/JPL CNEOS |accessdate=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* the more complex [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]], which ascribes ratings that can be any positive or negative real number; these ratings depend on the background impact frequency, impact probability and time until possible impact.&lt;ref name="palermo"/&gt;

On both scales, risks of any concern are indicated by values above zero.&lt;ref name="torino"/&gt;&lt;ref name="palermo"/&gt;

==== Magnitude of risk ====
The annual background frequency used in the Palermo scale for impacts of energy greater than ''E'' [[megatonne]]s is estimated as:&lt;ref name="palermo"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f_B = 0.03E^{-0.8} \;&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, this formula implies that the [[expected value]] of the time from now until the next impact greater than 1 megatonne is 33 years, and that when it occurs, there is a 50% chance that it will be above 2.4 megatonnes. This formula is only valid over a certain range of ''E''.

However, another paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The flux of small near-Earth objects colliding with the Earth |author=P. Brown et al. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=420 |issue=6913 |pages=294–296 |date=November 2002|bibcode=2002Natur.420..294B |doi=10.1038/nature01238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2002 – the same year as the paper on that the Palermo scale is based – found a power law with different constants:

:&lt;math&gt;f_B = 0.00737 E^{-0.9} \;&lt;/math&gt;

This formula gives considerably lower rates for a given ''E''. For instance, it gives the rate for bolides of 10 megatonnes or more (like the [[Tunguska explosion]]) as 1 per thousand years, rather than 1 per 210 years as in the Palermo formula. However, the authors give a rather large uncertainty (once in 400 to 1800 years for 10 megatonnes), due in part to uncertainties in determining the energies of the atmospheric impacts that they used in their determination.

==== Highly rated risks ====

[[NASA]] maintains an automated system to evaluate the threat from known NEOs over the next 100 years, which generates the continuously updated [[Sentry Risk Table]].&lt;ref name="Current_Impact_Risks" /&gt; All or nearly all of the objects are highly likely to drop off the list eventually as more observations come in, reducing the uncertainties and enabling more accurate orbital predictions.&lt;ref name="Current_Impact_Risks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2006HZ51"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9095-big-new-asteroid-has-slim-chance-of-hitting-earth.html |title=Big new asteroid has slim chance of hitting Earth |author=David Chandler |work=New Scientist |date=May 2, 2006 |accessdate=2017-11-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531181008/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9095-big-new-asteroid-has-slim-chance-of-hitting-earth.html |archivedate=2015-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asteroid {{mpl-|29075|1950 DA}} was lost after its 1950 discovery, since its observations over just 17 days were insufficient to determine its orbit; it was rediscovered on December 31, 2000. It has a diameter of about a kilometer (0.6 miles). It was also observed by radar during its close approach in 2001, allowing much more precise orbit calculations. Although this asteroid will not strike for at least 800 years and thus has no Torino scale rating, it was added to the Sentry list in April 2002 because it was the first object with a Palermo scale value greater than zero.&lt;ref name="IAU-NEOs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NEO-1950DA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Asteroid 1950 DA |publisher=NASA/JPL CNEOS |url=http://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/1950da/ |accessdate=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then-calculated 1 in 300 maximum chance of impact and +0.17 Palermo scale value was roughly 50% greater than the background risk of impact by all similarly large objects until 2880.&lt;ref name=Giorgini2002&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giorgini |first=J.

As a result, the ratio of the known and the estimated total number of near-Earth asteroids larger than 1&amp;nbsp;km in diameter rose from about 20% in 1998 to 65% in 2004,&lt;ref name="spaceguard-2004"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA on the Prowl for Near-Earth Objects |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=May 26, 2004 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/watchtheskies/near_earth052104.html |accessdate=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% in 2006,&lt;ref name="shigad"&gt;{{cite news |last=Shiga |first=David |title=New telescope will hunt dangerous asteroids |work=New Scientist |date=June 27, 2006 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9403 |accessdate=2018-03-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626133029/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9403 |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 93% in 2011.

In 2005, the original USA Spaceguard mandate was extended by the [[George E. Brown, Jr.]] Near-Earth Object Survey Act, which calls for NASA to detect 90% of NEOs with diameters of {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=on}} or greater, by 2020.&lt;ref name="law-109-155"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ155/pdf/PLAW-109publ155.pdf |title=Public Law 109–155–DEC.30, 2005 |accessdate=2017-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201223922/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ155/pdf/PLAW-109publ155.pdf |archivedate=2017-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, NASA announced the creation of the [[Planetary Defense Coordination Office]] (PDCO) to track NEOs larger than about {{convert|30–50|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effort.&lt;ref name="ETech"&gt;{{cite news |title=NASA is opening a new office for planetary defense |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/220745-nasa-is-opening-a-new-office-for-planetary-defense |author=Graham Templeton |date=January 12, 2016 |accessdate=2017-11-10 |work=ExtremeTech |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706223602/https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/220745-nasa-is-opening-a-new-office-for-planetary-defense |archivedate=July 6, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planetary Defense Coordination Office |publisher=NASA |url=https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/overview |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey programs aim to identify threats years in advance, giving humanity time to prepare a space mission to avert the threat.

Scientists involved in NEO research have also considered options for actively averting the threat from an object found to be on a collision course with Earth.&lt;ref name="Chapman1998"/&gt; All viable methods aim to deflect rather than destroy the threatening NEO, because the fragments would still cause widespread destruction.&lt;ref name="TaskForceReport"/&gt; Deflection, which means a change in the object's orbit months to years prior to the [[Asteroid impact prediction|predicted impact]], also requires orders of magnitude less energy.&lt;ref name="TaskForceReport"/&gt;

[[File:Known NEAs.png|thumb|Cumulative discoveries of near-Earth asteroids known by size, 1980–2017]]
Near-Earth objects are classified as [[meteoroid]]s, [[asteroid]]s, or [[comet]]s depending on size and composition. Asteroids can also be members of an [[asteroid family]], and comets create meteoroid streams that can generate [[meteor shower]]s.

{{As of|2018|09|22|df=US}}, according to statistics maintained by CNEOS, 18,837 NEOs have been discovered: 107 near-Earth comets and 18,730 near-Earth asteroids. There are 1,929 NEOs that are classified as potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs).&lt;ref name="neo-jpl-stats" /&gt; Discovery is heavily influenced by the [[opposition effect]], see diagram below.

{{As of|2018|09|23|df=US}}, there are 862 NEAs on the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry impact risk page]] at the [[NASA]] website.&lt;ref name="Current_Impact_Risks"/&gt; A significant number of these NEAs are equal to or smaller than 50 meters in diameter and none of the listed objects are placed even in the "green zone" (Torino Scale 1), meaning that none warrant the attention of general public.&lt;ref name="torino"/&gt;


===Observational biases===
One problem with understanding the true number of NEOs is that existing detection's are influenced by a number of factors.&lt;reF&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/288/5474/2190]&lt;/reF&gt; Observational biases need to be taken into account when trying to calculate the number of bodies in a population.&lt;reF&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/288/5474/2190]&lt;/reF&gt;  There is a bias towards finding asteroids that are easier to detect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.permanent.com/asteroids-discovering.html|title=Discovering Asteroids and NEOs by Telescopes|website=www.permanent.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, its has been easier to spot objects on the night-side of Earth, not only is there less noise from daylight, but its also the sunlit side of the asteroids whereas on in the daytime sky looking towards the sun, the backside of the object is seen (e.g comparing a [[Full moon]] at night to a [[New Moon]] in daytime). In addition, because of opposition surge they become even brighter when the Earth is along the axis of sunlight. Finally, its hard make observations in daylight near the Sun.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The light of sun hitting asteroids has been called "full asteroid" similar to a "full moon" and the greater amount of light, creates a bias that they are easier to detect in this case.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the year 2000, it was predicted that there are 900 near earth ''asteroids'' of at least kilometer size taking into account known observational biases.&lt;reF&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/288/5474/2190]&lt;/reF&gt; Studies of asteroid populations try to take into account observational selection biases to make a more accurate assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/473193E5630087D10679A2A1037493EE/S0252921100070093a.pdf/div-class-title-2-asteroid-compositional-types-and-their-distributions-div.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt; Finding observational biases can help determine NEO populations, for example, one study noted that bodies in low-eccentricity Earth-crossing  orbits were favored, making the detection of Aten more favorured then Apollos.&lt;reF&gt;[https://www.boulder.swri.edu/~bottke/Reprints/Bottke_1996_Icarus_122_406_Origin_Spacewatch_NEOs.pdf] (Page 414)&lt;/reF&gt;

Two of the biggest Near-Earth objects 433 Eros and 1036 Ganymed, were also some the earliest to be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/us/mathematicians-say-asteroid-may-hit-earth-in-a-million-years.html|title=Mathematicians Say Asteroid May Hit Earth in a Million Years|last=Browne|first=Malcolm W.|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1036 Ganymed is about 20 miles in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/25/us/mathematicians-say-asteroid-may-hit-earth-in-a-million-years.html|title=Mathematicians Say Asteroid May Hit Earth in a Million Years|last=Browne|first=Malcolm W.|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As bigger asteroids they refflected more light.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One way around simply finding the NEOs that reflect the most visible light, is to use infrared telescopes that observe the objects heat emissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Asteroids and other SSSB have been known to experience opposition effect (or surge) which means that when viewing closer to the axis of the direction of incoming light, more light is returned.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2018/08/aa32721-18/aa32721-18.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A small number of NEAs are [[extinct comets]] that have lost their volatile surface materials, although having a faint or intermittent comet-like tail does not necessarily result in a classification as a near-Earth comet, making the boundaries somewhat fuzzy.

While a small fraction of these asteroids has accurate direct diameter measurements, from [[radar]] observations, from images of the asteroid surface, or from [[Occultation#Occultations by asteroids|stellar occultations]], the size of the vast majority of near Earth asteroids can only be estimated on the basis of their brightness and a representative asteroid [[albedo]] or surface reflectivity, which is commonly assumed to be 14%.&lt;ref name="neo-jpl-intro"&gt;{{cite web |title=Discovery Statistics.

==== Orbital classification ====
[[File:Neas.svg|thumb|Types of near-Earth asteroid orbits]]
Near-Earth asteroids are divided into groups based on their [[semi-major axis]] (a), [[Apsis|perihelion]] distance (q), and [[Apsis|aphelion]] distance (Q):&lt;ref name="NEO-groups"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MorbidelliAstIII" /&gt;
* The ''[[Atira asteroid|Atiras]]'' or ''Apoheles'' have orbits strictly inside Earth's orbit: an Atira asteroid's aphelion distance (Q) is smaller than Earth's perihelion distance (0.983&amp;nbsp;AU). That is, {{nowrap|Q &lt; 0.983 AU}}. (This implies that the asteroid's semi-major axis is also less than 0.983 AU.)
* The ''[[Aten asteroid|Atens]]'' have a semi-major axis of less than 1&amp;nbsp;AU and cross Earth's orbit. Mathematically, {{nowrap|a &lt; 1.0 AU}} and {{nowrap|Q &gt; 0.983 AU}}.
* The ''[[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]]'' have a semi-major axis of more than 1&amp;nbsp;AU and cross Earth's orbit. Mathematically, {{nowrap|a &gt; 1.0 AU}} and {{nowrap|q &lt; 1.017 AU}}. (1.017&amp;nbsp;AU is Earth's aphelion distance.)
* The ''[[Amor asteroid|Amors]]'' have orbits strictly outside Earth's orbit: an Amor asteroid's perihelion distance (q) is greater than Earth's aphelion distance (1.017&amp;nbsp;AU). Amor asteroids are also near-earth objects so {{nowrap|q &lt; 1.3 AU}}. In summary, {{nowrap|1.017 AU &lt; q &lt; 1.3 AU}}. (This implies that the asteroid's semi-major axis (a) is also larger than 1.017&amp;nbsp;AU.) Some Amor asteroid orbits cross the orbit of Mars.

(Note: Some authors define Atens differently: they define it as being all the asteroids with a semi-major axis of less than 1&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unusual Minor Planets |publisher=IAU/MPC |date=March 8, 2018 |url=https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/Unusual.html |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="galache"/&gt; That is, they consider the Atiras to be part of the Atens.&lt;ref name="galache"&gt;{{cite web |author=J. L. Galache |title=Asteroid Classification I – Dynamics |publisher=IAU/MPC |date=March 5, 2011 |url=http://minorplanetcenter.net/blog/asteroid-classification-i-dynamics/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235814/http://minorplanetcenter.net/blog/asteroid-classification-i-dynamics/ |accessdate=2018-03-09 |archivedate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, until 1998, there were no known or suspected Atiras, so the distinction wasn't necessary.)

Atiras and Amors do not cross the Earth's orbit and are not immediate impact threats, but their orbits may change to become Earth-crossing orbits in the future.&lt;ref name="MorbidelliAstIII"/&gt;

{{As of|2018|05|10|df=US}}, 17 Atiras, 1,342 Atens, 9,964 Apollos and 6,813 Amors have been discovered and cataloged.&lt;ref name="neo-jpl-stats" /&gt;

==== Co-orbital asteroids ====
[[File:Lagrange Horseshoe Orbit.jpg|thumb|The five Lagrangian points relative to Earth and possible orbits along gravitational contours]]

NEAs on a [[co-orbital configuration]] have the same orbital period as the Earth. All co-orbital asteroids have special orbits that are relatively stable and, paradoxically, can prevent them from getting close to Earth:
* ''[[Trojan (astronomy)|Trojans]]'': Near the orbit of a planet, there are five gravitational equilibrium points, the [[Lagrangian point]]s, in which an asteroid would orbit the Sun in fixed formation with the planet. Two of these, 60 degrees ahead and behind the planet along its orbit (designated L4 and L5 respectively) are stable; that is, an asteroid near these points would stay there for millions of years even if perturbed by other planets and non-gravitational forces. {{As of|2018|03}}, Earth's only confirmed Trojan is {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, circling Earth's L4 point.&lt;ref name="WISE"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20110727.html |title=NASA's WISE Mission Finds First Trojan Asteroid Sharing Earth's Orbit |date=July 27, 2011 |work=News |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2017-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220100503/https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/news/wise20110727.html |archivedate=2017-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Horseshoe orbit|Horseshoe librators]]'': The region of stability around L4 and L5 also includes orbits for co-orbital asteroids that run around both L4 and L5. Seen from Earth, the orbit can resemble the circumference of a horseshoe, or may consist of annual loops that wander back and forth ([[Libration|librate]]) in a horseshoe-shaped area. In both cases, the Sun is at the horseshoe's center of gravity, Earth is in the gap of the horseshoe, and L4 and L5 are inside the ends of the horseshoe. By 2016, 12 horseshoe librators of Earth have been discovered.&lt;ref name="Fuentes-horseshoe"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=C. |last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=R. |title=A trio of horseshoes: past, present and future dynamical evolution of Earth co-orbital asteroids {{mp|2015 XX|169}}, 2015 YA and {{mp|2015 YQ|1}} |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |volume=361 |issue=4 |pages=121–133 |date=April 2016 |doi=10.1007/s10509-016-2711-6 |arxiv=1603.02415 |bibcode=2016Ap&amp;SS.361..121D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most-studied and, at about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, largest is [[3753 Cruithne]], which travels along bean-shaped annual loops and completes its horseshoe libration cycle every 770 to 780 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.astro.uwo.ca/~wiegert/papers/1997Nature.387.685.pdf |title=An asteroidal companion to the Earth (letter) |last1=Wiegert |first1=Paul A. |last2=Innanen |first2=Kimmo A. |last3=Mikkola |first3=Seppo |journal=Nature |date=June 12, 1997 |volume=387 |issue=6634 |pages=685–686 |accessdate=2017-11-13 |doi=10.1038/42662 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626032239/http://www.astro.uwo.ca/~wiegert/papers/1997Nature.387.685.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwu.edu/depts/skywise/a101_cruithne.html |title=Cruithne: Asteroid 3753 |publisher=Western Washington University Planetarium |accessdate=2017-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/691xFCKls?url=http://www.wwu.edu/depts/skywise/a101_cruithne.html |archivedate=2012-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{mpl|419624|2010 SO|16}} is an asteroid on a relatively stable circumference-of-a-horseshoe orbit, with a horseshoe libration period of about 350 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Christou |first1=A.

* ''[[Quasi-satellite]]s'': Quasi-satellites are co-orbital asteroids on a normal elliptic orbit with a higher eccentricity than Earth's, which they travel in a way synchronised with Earth's motion. Since the asteroid orbits the Sun slower than Earth when further away and faster than Earth when closer to the Sun, when observed from Earth, the quasi-satellite appears to orbit Earth in a [[retrograde motion|retrograde]] direction in one year, even though it is not bound gravitationally. By 2016, five asteroids were known to be a quasi-satellite of Earth. {{mpl|469219|2016 HO|3}} is Earth's closest quasi-satellite, in an orbit that has been stable for almost a century.&lt;ref name="Fuentes-2016HO3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de la Fuente Marcos |first1=C. |last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=R. |title=Asteroid (469219) {{mp|469219|2016 HO|3}}, the smallest and closest Earth quasi-satellite |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=462 |issue=4 |pages=3441–3456 |date=November 11, 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw1972 |arxiv=1608.01518 |bibcode=2016MNRAS.462.3441D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbit calculations until 2016 showed that all quasi-satellites and four of the horseshoe librators then known repeatedly transfer between horseshoe and quasi-satellite orbits.&lt;ref name="Fuentes-2016HO3"/&gt; One of these objects, {{mpl|2003 YN|107}}, was observed during its transition from a quasi-satellite orbit to a horseshoe orbit in 2006; it is expected to transfer back to a quasi-satellite orbit 60 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/09jun_moonlets.htm |title=Corkscrew Asteroid |author=Tony Phillips|date=June 9, 2006 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2017-11-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929155325/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/09jun_moonlets.htm |archivedate=2006-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Temporary satellite]]s'': NEAs can also transfer between solar orbits and distant Earth orbits, becoming gravitationally bound temporary satellites. According to simulations, temporary satellites are typically caught when they pass the L1 or L2 Lagrangian points, and Earth has at least one temporary satellite {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} across at any given time, but they are too faint to detect by current surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Camille M.

=== Meteoroids ===

In 1961, the IAU defined [[meteoroid]]s as a class of solid interplanetary objects distinct from asteroids by their considerably smaller size.&lt;ref name="Rubin2010"/&gt; This definition was useful at the time because, with the exception of the [[Tunguska event]], all historically observed meteors were produced by objects significantly smaller than the smallest asteroids observable by telescopes.&lt;ref name="Rubin2010"/&gt; As the distinction began to blur with the discovery of ever smaller asteroids and a greater variety of observed NEO impacts, revised definitions with size limits have been proposed from the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Rubin2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=Alan E. |last2=Grossman |first2=Jeffrey N. |title=Meteorite and meteoroid: New comprehensive definitions |journal=Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=114–122 |date=January 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.01009.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.01009.x/full |accessdate=2018-01-22 |bibcode=2010M&amp;PS...45..114R |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122235019/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.01009.x/full |archivedate=2018-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, the IAU adopted a revised definition that generally limits meteoroids to a size between 30&amp;nbsp;µm and 1&amp;nbsp;m in diameter, but permits the use of the term for any object of any size that caused a meteor, thus leaving the distinction between asteroid and meteoroid blurred.&lt;ref name="met-def-2017"&gt;{{cite news |author=Vincent Perlerin |title=Definitions of terms in meteor astronomy (IAU) |date=September 26, 2017 |work=News |publisher=[[International Meteor Organization]] |url=https://www.imo.net/definitions-of-terms-in-meteor-astronomy-iau/ |accessdate=2018-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072313/https://www.imo.net/definitions-of-terms-in-meteor-astronomy-iau/ |archivedate=2018-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comet Swift-Tuttle|Comet 109P/Swift–Tuttle]], which is also the source of the [[Perseids|Perseid meteor shower]] which hits Earth every year in August, has a roughly 130-year orbit which passes close to the Earth. After the comet's 1992 return, when only the two previous returns in 1862 and 1737 have been identified, orbital calculations showed that the comet would pass very close to Earth during its next return in 2126, with an impact within the range of uncertainty. By 1993, even earlier returns (back to at least 188 AD) have been identified, and the new orbital calculation eliminated the impact risk, predicting the comet to pass Earth in 2126 at a distance of 24 million kilometers. In 3044, the comet is expected to pass Earth at less than 1.6 million kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://astrosociety.org/edu/publications/tnl/23/23.html#swifttuttle |title=What about the comet that's supposed to hit the Earth in 130 years? |author=Sally Stephens |work=Cosmic Collisions |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific |date=1993 |accessdate=2017-11-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824003728/http://astrosociety.org/edu/publications/tnl/23/23.html#swifttuttle |archivedate=2017-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defunct space probes and [[Multistage rocket|final stages of rockets]] can end up in near-Earth orbits around the Sun, and be re-discovered by NEO surveys when they return to Earth's vicinity.

In September 2002, astronomers found an object designated [[J002E3]]. The object was on a temporary satellite orbit around Earth, leaving for a solar orbit in June 2003. Calculations showed that it was also on a solar orbit before 2002, but was close to Earth in 1971. J002E3 was identified as the third stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket that carried [[Apollo 12]] to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news136.html |title=J002E3: An Update |work=News |publisher=NASA |date=October 9, 2002 |accessdate=2017-11-14 |first1=Steve |last1=Chesley |first2=Paul |last2=Chodas |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030503111617/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news136.html |archivedate=2003-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rocket-or-rock"/&gt; In 2006, two more apparent temporary satellites were discovered which were suspected of being artificial.&lt;ref name="rocket-or-rock"/&gt; One of them was eventually confirmed as an asteroid and classified as the temporary satellite {{mp|2006 RH|120}}.&lt;ref name="rocket-or-rock"/&gt; The other, [[6Q0B44E]], was confirmed as an artificial object, but its identity is unknown.&lt;ref name="rocket-or-rock"/&gt; Another confirmed artificial temporary satellite with unidentified origin is {{mp|2013 QW|1}}.&lt;ref name="rocket-or-rock"&gt;{{cite news |last=Azriel |first=Merryl |title=Rocket or Rock?

In some cases, active space probes on solar orbits have been observed by NEO surveys and erroneously catalogued as asteroids before identification. During its 2007 flyby of Earth on its route to a comet, [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s space probe ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'' was detected unidentified and classified as asteroid {{mp|2007 VN|84}}, with an alert issued due to its close approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12914-astronomers-defend-asteroid-warning-mix-up/ |title=Astronomers defend asteroid warning mix-up |author=Justin Mullins |date=November 13, 2007 |work=New Scientist |accessdate=2017-11-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307062102/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12914-astronomers-defend-asteroid-warning-mix-up/ |archivedate=2017-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation {{mp|2015 HP|116}} was similarly removed from asteroid catalogues when the observed object was identified with ''[[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]]'', ESA's [[space observatory]] for [[astrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/mpec/K15/K15HC5.html |title=MPEC 2015-H125: Deletion Of 2015 HP116 |date=April 27, 2015 |work=Minor Planet Electronic Circular |accessdate=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts ==

{{main|Impact event}}

When a near-Earth object impacts Earth, objects up to a few tens of metres across ordinarily explode in the [[Mesosphere|upper atmosphere]] (usually harmlessly), with most or all of the solids [[Evaporation|vaporized]], while larger objects hit the water surface, forming waves, or the solid surface, forming [[impact crater]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Clark R.

== Exploratory missions ==

Some NEOs are of special interest because they can be physically explored with lower [[mission velocity]] than is necessary for even the Moon, due to their combination of low velocity with respect to Earth and weak gravity. They may present interesting scientific opportunities both for direct geochemical and astronomical investigation, and as potentially economical sources of extraterrestrial materials for human exploitation.&lt;ref name="USAToday-NEA"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2007-02-12-asteroid_x.htm |title=Near-Earth asteroids could be 'steppingstones to Mars' |author=Dan Vergano |work=USA Today |date=February 2, 2007 |accessdate=2017-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417034648/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2007-02-12-asteroid_x.htm |archivedate=2012-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes them an attractive target for exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Design and optimization of trajectory to Near-Earth asteroid for sample return mission using gravity assists |author=Rui Xu |author2=Pingyuan Cui |author3=Dong Qiao |author4=Enjie Luan |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=200–225 |date=March 18, 2007 |doi=10.1016/j.asr.2007.03.025 |bibcode=2007AdSpR..40..220X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missions to NEAs ===

{{Further|List of minor planets and comets visited by spacecraft}}

The IAU held a minor planets workshop in [[Tucson, Arizona]], in March 1971. At that point, launching a spacecraft to asteroids was considered premature; the workshop only inspired the first astronomical survey specifically aiming for NEAs.&lt;ref name="wired20130323"/&gt; Missions to asteroids were considered again during a workshop at the [[University of Chicago]] held by NASA’s Office of Space Science in January 1978. Of all of the near-Earth asteroids (NEA) that had been discovered by mid-1977, it was estimated that spacecraft could [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with and return from only about 1 in 10 using less [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsive energy]] than is necessary to reach [[Mars]]. It was recognised that due to the low surface gravity of all NEAs, moving around on the surface of a NEA would cost very little energy, and thus space probes could gather multiple samples.&lt;ref name="wired20130323"/&gt; Overall, it was estimated that about one percent of all NEAs might provide opportunities for [[human spaceflight|human-crewed]] missions, or no more than about ten NEAs known at the time. A five-fold increase in the NEA discovery rate was deemed necessary to make a manned mission within ten years worthwhile.&lt;ref name="wired20130323"/&gt;

The first near-Earth asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft was {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} asteroid [[433 Eros]] when [[NASA]]'s ''[[NEAR Shoemaker|Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous]]'' (''NEAR'') probe orbited it from February 2001, landing on the asteroid surface in February 2002.&lt;ref name="Eros-NEAR"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/news/near_descent_pr_20010131.html |title=NEAR Mission Completes Main Task, Now Will Go Where No Spacecraft Has Gone Before |author=Donald Savage |author2=Michael Buckley |last-author-amp=yes |work=Press Releases |publisher=NASA |date=January 31, 2001 |accessdate=2017-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617001709/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/news/near_descent_pr_20010131.html |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second near-Earth asteroid, the {{convert|535|m|ft|abbr=on}} long peanut-shaped [[25143 Itokawa]], was visited in September 2005 by [[JAXA]]'s ''[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]]'' mission,&lt;ref name="Itokawa-hayabusa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/hayabusa.html |title=Hayabusa's Contributions Toward Understanding the Earth's Neighborhood |author=Don Yeomans |date=August 11, 2005 |publisher=NASA/JPL Near Earth Object Program |accessdate=2017-11-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905132305/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/hayabusa.html |archivedate=2005-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which succeeded in taking material samples back to Earth.

=== Missions to NECs ===
[[File:Comet 67P on 19 September 2014 NavCam mosaic.jpg|thumb|67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko as seen by ESA's ''Rosetta'' probe]]

The first near-Earth comet visited by a space probe was [[21P/Giacobini–Zinner]] in 1985, when the NASA/ESA probe ''[[International Cometary Explorer]]'' (''ICE'') passed through its coma. In March 1986, ICE, along with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] probes ''[[Vega 1]]'' and ''[[Vega 2]]'', [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] probes ''[[Sakigake]]'' and ''[[Suisei (spacecraft)|Suisei]]'' and ESA probe ''[[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]]'' flew by the nucleus of Halley's Comet. In 1992, ''Giotto'' also visited another NEC, [[26P/Grigg–Skjellerup]].&lt;ref name="TaskForceReport"/&gt;

In November 2010, the NASA probe ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' flew by the near-Earth comet [[103P/Hartley]]. Earlier, in July 2005, this probe flew by the non-near-Earth comet [[Tempel 1]], hitting it with a large copper mass.&lt;ref name="DeepImpactHartley"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mr. Hartley's Amazing Comet |first=Kelly |last=Beatty |date=November 4, 2010 |work=Sky &amp; Telescope |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/106720468.html |accessdate=2018-03-19 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20101107194918/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/106720468.html |archivedate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, ESA probe ''Rosetta'' began orbiting near-Earth comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], while its lander ''[[Philae (spacecraft)|Philae]]'' landed on its surface in November 2014. After the end of its mission, Rosetta was crashed into the comet′s surface in 2016.&lt;ref name="newsci20160930"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jacob |last=Aron |title=Rosetta lands on 67P in grand finale to two year comet mission |work=New Scientist |date=September 30, 2016 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2107585-rosetta-lands-on-67p-in-grand-finale-to-two-year-comet-mission/ |accessdate=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5083">The '''O'Connell effect''' is an asymmetry in the [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] [[light curve]] of certain close [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary star]]s. It was named after the astronomer D. J. K. O'Connell, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]]&lt;ref name = milone1968&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Peculiar Binary RT Lacertae | journal = Astronomical Journal | volume = 73 | issue = 8 | page = 708 | year = 1968 | bibcode=1968AJ.....73..708M | doi = 10.1086/110682 | last1 = Milone | first1 = E. F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview|Riverview College]] in [[New South Wales]] who in 1951 studied this phenomenon and distinguished it from the so-called periastron effect described by earlier authors, as it does not necessarily appear near the [[Apsis|periastron]], when [[Tidal force|tidal effects]] and an increase in mutual radiation may cause an increase in [[luminosity]].&lt;ref name = "O'Connell1951"&gt;{{cite journal | title = The so-called periastron effect in close eclipsing binaries | journal = Riverview College Observatory Publications | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | page = 85| year = 1951 | bibcode=1951PRCO....2...85O | last1 = O'Connell | first1 = D.

== The effect ==

The out-of-eclipse brightness maxima of some binary stars are unequally high. This is contrary to expectations that the observed [[luminosity]] of an eclipsing binary should be the same when its components switch positions every half period. The maximum following the primary minimum is nearly always brighter than the preceding one. This is called the positive O'Connell effect, the reverse case is referred to as the negative O'Connell effect. The difference increases with the ellipticity of the stars, and the differences in their sizes and densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Possible Explanation of the O'Connell Effect in Close Binary Stars | journal = Chinese Journal of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | volume = 3 | page = 142 | year = 2003 | bibcode=2003ChJAA...3..142L| last1 = Liu | first1 = Qing-Yao | last2 = Yang | first2 = Yu-Lan | doi = 10.1088/1009-9271/3/2/142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] differences have been observed between subsequent maxima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A study of the O'Connell effect in the light curves of eclipsing binaries | journal = Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume = 55 | year = 1984 | page = 571 | bibcode=1984ApJS...55..571D| last1 = Davidge | first1 = T. J. | last2 = Milone | first2 = E. F. | doi = 10.1086/190969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts at explanation ==

In some systems where the phenomenon has been observed, such as in CG Cygni, RT Lacertae, XY Ursae Majoris, or YY Eridani, the luminosity difference between subsequent maxima has been found to be variable, in others relatively stable. Furthermore, it has been observed in a variety of configurations, such as over-contact, semi-detached, and near contact systems alike. These factors make an explanation difficult and suggest that various mechanisms may be responsible for the effect to manifest. Several reasons have thus been proposed: an asymmetric distribution of [[starspot]]s, impacts of one-way gas streams between the components of the binary system, or the flow of circumstellar matter, asymmetrically deflected due to [[Coriolis force]]s.&lt;ref name = WilseyBeaky2009&gt;{{cite journal | title = Revisitng the O'Connell Effect in Eclipsing Binary Systems | bibcode=2009SASS...28..107W | journal = 28th Annual Symposium on Telescope Science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16404">In [[macroecology]] and [[community (ecology)|community ecology]], an '''occupancy frequency distribution''' ('''OFD''') is the distribution of the numbers of species occupying different numbers of areas.&lt;ref name="Mcgeoch2002"/&gt; It was first reported in 1918 by the Danish botanist [[Christen C. Raunkiær]] in his study on plant communities. The OFD is also known as the species-range size distribution in literature.&lt;ref name="Gaston1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaston1998"/&gt;

== Bimodality ==

A typical form of OFD is a [[bimodal distribution]], indicating the [[species]] in a community is either rare or common, known as Raunkiaer's law of distribution of frequencies.&lt;ref name="Papp1997" /&gt; That is, with each species assigned to one of five 20%-wide occupancy classes, Raunkiaer's law predicts bimodal distributions within homogenous plant formations with [[mode (statistics)|modes]] in the first (0-20%) and last (81-100%) classes.&lt;ref name="Papp1997" /&gt; Although Raunkiaer's law has long been discounted as an index of plant community homogeneity,&lt;ref name="Mcintosh1962"/&gt; the method of using occupancy classes to construct OFDs is still commonly used for both plant and animal assemblages. [[Henry Gleason]] commented on this law in a 1929 ''[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]'' article: "In conclusion we may say that Raunkiaer's law is merely an expression of the fact that in any association there are more species with few individuals than with many, that the law is most apparent when [[quadrat]]s are chosen of the most serviceable size to show frequency, and that it is obscured or lost if the quadrats are either too large or too small."&lt;ref name="Gleason1929" /&gt;  Evidently, there are different shapes of OFD found in literature. Tokeshi reported that approximately 46% of observations have a [[skewness|right-skewed]] [[unimodal distribution|unimodal shape]], 27% bimodal, and 27% [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]].&lt;ref name="Tokeshi1992"/&gt; A recent study reaffirms about 24% bimodal OFDs in among 289 real communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hui | first1 = C | year = 2012 | title = Scale effect and bimodality in the frequency distribution of species occupancy | url = | journal = Community Ecology | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 30–35 | doi = 10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.1.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==

As pointed out by Gleason,&lt;ref name="Gleason1929" /&gt; the variety shapes of OFD can be explained, to a large degree, by the size of the sampling interval. For instance, McGeoch and Gaston (2002)&lt;ref name="Mcgeoch2002"/&gt; show that the number of satellite (rare) species declines with the increase of sampling grains, but the number of core (common) species increases, showing a tendency from a bimodal OFD towards a right-skewed unimodal distribution. This is because [[species range]], measured as occupancy, is strongly affected by the spatial scale and its aggregation structure,&lt;ref name="Hui2010"/&gt; known often as the [[scaling pattern of occupancy]]. Such scale dependence of occupancy has a profound effect on other macroecological patterns, such as the [[occupancy-abundance relationship]].

Other factors that have been proposed to be able to affect the shape of OFD include the degree of habitat heterogeneity,&lt;ref name="Raunkiaer1934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1984"/&gt; species specificity,&lt;ref name="Brown1995"/&gt; landscape productivity,&lt;ref name="Maurer1990"/&gt; position in the geographic range,&lt;ref name="Williams1988"/&gt; species dispersal ability&lt;ref name="Collins1997"/&gt; and the extinction–colonization dynamics.&lt;ref name="Hanski1982"/&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

Three basic models have been proposed to explain the bimodality found in occupancy frequency distributions.

===Sampling results===
Random sampling of individuals from either [[lognormal]] or [[log-series distrbution|log-series]] rank abundance distributions (where random choice of an individual from a given species was proportional to its frequency) may produce bimodal occupancy distributions.&lt;ref name="Papp1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nee1991"/&gt; This model is not particularly sensitive or informative as to the mechanisms generating bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions, because the mechanisms generating the lognormal species abundance distribution are still under heavy debate.

===Core-satellite hypothesis===
Bimodality may be generated by colonization-extinction metapopulation dynamics associated with a strong rescue effect.&lt;ref name="Hanski1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanski1993"/&gt; This model is appropriate to explain the range structure of a community that is influenced by metapopulation processes, such as dispersal and [[local extinction]].&lt;ref name="Storch2002"/&gt; However, it is not robust because the shape of the occupancy frequency distribution generated by this model is highly sensitive
to species immigration and extinction parameters.&lt;ref name="Tokeshi1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheiner1997"/&gt; The metapopulation model does also not explain scale dependence in the occupancy frequency distribution.

===Occupancy probability transition===
The third model that describes bimodality in the occupancy frequency distribution is based on the [[scaling pattern of occupancy]] under a [[Self-similarity|self-similar]] assumption of species distributions (called the occupancy probability transition [OPT] model).&lt;ref name="Hui2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hui2007b"/&gt; The OPT model is based on Harte et al.'s bisection scheme&lt;ref name="Harte1999"/&gt; (although not on their probability rule) and the recursion probability of occupancy at different scales. The OPT model has been shown to support two empirical observations:&lt;ref name="Hui2007a"/&gt;
#That bimodality is prevalent in interspecific occupancy frequency distributions.
#that the number of satellite species in the distribution increases towards finer scales.

The OPT model demonstrates that the sample grain of a study, sampling adequacy, and the distribution of species saturation coefficients (a measure of the fractal dimensionality of a species distribution) in a community are together largely able to explain the patterns commonly found in empirical occupancy distributions. [[Cang Hui|Hui]] and McGeoch (2007) further show that the self-similarity in species distributions breaks down according to a power relationship with spatial scales, and we therefore adopt a power-scaling assumption for modeling species occupancy distributions.&lt;ref name="Hui2007b"/&gt; The bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions that is common in species communities, is confirmed to a result for certain mathematical and statistical properties of the probability distribution of occupancy. The results thus demonstrate that the use of the bisection method in combination with a power-scaling assumption is more appropriate for modeling species distributions than the use of a self-similarity assumption, particularly at fine scales. This model further provokes the Harte-Maddux debate: Harte et al.&lt;ref name="Harte1999"/&gt; demonstrated that the [[power law]] form of the [[Species-area curve|species–area relationship]] may be derived from a bisected, self-similar landscape and a community-level probability rule.&lt;ref name="Ostling2004"/&gt; However, Maddux&lt;ref name="Maddux2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maddux1999"/&gt; showed that this self-similarity model generates biologically unrealistic predictions. [[Cang Hui|Hui]] and McGeoch (2008) resolve the Harte–Maddux debate by demonstrating that the problems identified by Maddux result from an assumption that the probability of occurrence of a species at one scale is independent of its probability of occurrence at the next, and further illustrate the importance of considering patterns of species co-occurrence, and the way in which species occupancy patterns change with scale, when modeling species distributions.&lt;ref name="Hui2008"/&gt;

==History==

Important preliminary theoretical work was carried prior to the planetary missions launched starting in the 1970s. In particular, Lewis showed in 1971 that [[radioactive decay]] alone was likely sufficient to produce subsurface oceans in large moons, especially if ammonia ([[Ammonia|{{chem|NH|3}}]]) was present. Peale and Cassen figured out in 1979 the important role of [[tidal heating]] (aka: tidal flexing) on satellite evolution and structure.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt; The first confirmed detection of an exoplanet was in 1992. Alain Léger ''et al'' figured in 2004 that a small number of icy planets that form in the region beyond the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|snow line]] can [[Planetary migration|migrate]] inward to ∼1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]], where the outer layers subsequently melt.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Léger/&gt;

The cumulative evidence collected by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], as well as [[Pioneer program|''Pioneer'']], ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'', ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'', and ''[[New Horizons]]'' missions, strongly indicate that several outer Solar System bodies harbour internal liquid water oceans under an insulating ice shell.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greenberg"&gt;Greenberg, Richard (2005)  ''Europa: The Ocean Moon: Search for an Alien Biosphere'', Springer + Praxis Books, {{ISBN|978-3-540-27053-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' space observatory]], launched in March 7, 2009, has discovered thousands of exoplanets, about 50 of them of [[Terrestrial planet|Earth-size]] in or near [[habitable zone]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140512"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Finder of New Worlds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/science/finder-of-new-worlds.html |date=May 12, 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150106-DB"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=As Ranks of Goldilocks Planets Grow, Astronomers Consider What's Next |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/science/space/as-ranks-of-goldilocks-planets-grow-astronomers-consider-whats-next.html |date=January 6, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planets of almost all masses, sizes, and orbits have been detected, illustrating not only the variable nature of planet formation but also a subsequent migration through the [[circumstellar disc]] from the planet's place of origin.&lt;ref name="Seager 2013"/&gt; {{Extrasolar planet counts|full}}

==Formation==
[[File:HL Tau protoplanetary disk.jpg|thumb|[[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] image of [[HL Tauri]], a [[protoplanetary disk]] ]]

Planetary objects that form in the outer [[Solar System]] begin as a [[comet]]-like mixture of roughly half water and half rock by mass, displaying a density lower than that of rocky planets.&lt;ref name=Léger&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910350400020X A new family of planets?

Volume 169, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 499–504. {{DOI|10.1016/j.icarus.2004.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icy planets and moons that form near the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]] should contain mostly {{chem|H|2|O}} and [[silicate]]s. Those that form farther out can acquire ammonia ({{chem|NH|3}}) and methane ({{chem|CH|4}}) as hydrates, together with [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[Nitrogen|{{chem|N|2}}]], and [[Carbon dioxide|{{chem|CO|2}}]].&lt;ref name="apj"/&gt;

Planets that form prior to the dissipation of the gaseous [[Accretion disk|circumstellar disk]] experience strong torques that can induce rapid inward migration into the habitable zone, especially for planets in the terrestrial mass range.&lt;ref name=Luger/&gt;&lt;ref name="apj"/&gt; Since water is highly soluble in [[magma]], a large fraction of the planet's water content will initially be trapped in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. As the planet cools and the mantle begins to solidify from the bottom up, large amounts of water (between 60% and 99% of the total amount in the mantle) are [[Solid solution#Exsolution|exsolved]] to form a steam atmosphere, which may eventually condense to form an ocean.&lt;ref name=Luger/&gt;  Ocean formation requires [[Planetary differentiation|differentiation]], and a heat source, either [[radioactive decay]], [[tidal heating]], or the early luminosity of the parent body.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt; Unfortunately, the initial conditions following [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] are theoretically incomplete.

Planets that formed in the outer, water-rich regions of a [[Accretion disk|disk]] and migrated inward are more likely to have abundant water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0710/0710.2366.pdf New Worlds on the Horizon: Earth-Sized Planets Close to Other Stars].

===Structure===

The internal structure of an icy astronomical body is generally deduced from measurements of its bulk density, gravity moments,
and shape. Determining the moment of inertia of a body can help assess whether it has undergone [[Planetary differentiation|differentiation]] (separation into rock-ice layers) or not. Shape or [[Gravimetry|gravity measurements]] can in some cases be used to infer the moment of inertia – if the body is in [[Hydrostatic equilibrium#Planetary geology|hydrostatic equilibrium]] (i.e. behaving like a fluid on long timescales). However, proving that a body is in hydrostatic equilibrium is extremely difficult, but by using a combination of shape and gravity data, the hydrostatic contributions can be deduced.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt; Specific techniques to detect inner oceans include [[magnetic induction]], [[geodesy]], [[libration]]s, [[axial tilt]], [[Tidal acceleration|tidal response]], [[Radioglaciology|radar sounding]], compositional evidence, and surface features.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt;

[[File:Ganymede diagram.svg|thumb|400px|right|Artist's cut-away representation of the internal structure of [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], with a liquid water ocean "sandwiched" between two ice layers. Layers drawn to scale.]]
A generic [[icy moon]] will consist of a water layer sitting atop a [[Planetary core|silicate core]]. For a small satellite like [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], an ocean will sit directly above the silicates and below a solid icy shell, but for a larger ice-rich body like [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], pressures are sufficiently high that the ice at depth will transform to higher pressure phases, effectively forming a "water sandwich" with an ocean located between ice shells.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt; An important difference between these two cases is that for the small satellite the ocean is in direct contact with the silicates, which may provide [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]] and chemical energy and nutrients to simple life forms.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt; Because of the varying [[hydrostatic pressure|pressure]] at depth, models of a water world may include "steam, liquid, superfluid, high-pressure ices, and plasma phases" of water.&lt;ref name="arxiv0912"&gt;

Maintaining a subsurface ocean depends on the rate of internal heating compared with the rate at which heat is removed, and the [[freezing point]] of the liquid.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt; Ocean survival and tidal heating are thus intimately linked.

Smaller ocean planets would have less dense atmospheres and lower gravity; thus, liquid could evaporate much more easily than on more massive ocean planets. Simulations suggest that planets and satellites of less than one Earth mass could have liquid oceans driven by [[hydrothermal activity]], [[Radiogenic nuclide#Radiogenic heating|radiogenic heating]], or [[Tidal heating|tidal flexing]].&lt;ref name="Vance 2007"/&gt; Where fluid-rock interactions propagate slowly into a deep brittle layer, thermal energy from [[serpentinization]] may be the primary cause of hydrothermal activity in small ocean planets.&lt;ref name="Vance 2007"/&gt; The dynamics of global oceans beneath tidally flexing ice shells represents a significant set of challenges which have barely begun to be explored. The extent to which [[cryovolcanism]] occurs is a subject of some debate, as water, being denser than ice by about 8%, has difficulty erupting under normal circumstances.&lt;ref name="Nimmo 2016"/&gt;

To allow water to be liquid for long periods of time, a planet —or moon— must orbit within the [[circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] (HZ), possess a protective [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]],&lt;ref name="Driscoll 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Optimal dynamos in the cores of terrestrial exoplanets: Magnetic field generation and detectability |journal=Icarus |date=May 2011 |last=Driscoll |first=Peter |volume=213 |issue=1 |pages=12–23 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2011.02.010 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103511000595 |accessdate=2017-10-05 |bibcode=2011Icar..213...12D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/734/1/L13/meta Hydrogen green house planets beyond the Habitable Zone].

A planet's atmosphere forms from outgassing during planet formation or is gravitationally captured from the surrounding [[protoplanetary nebula]]. The surface temperature on an exoplanet is governed by the atmosphere's [[greenhouse gas]]es (or lack thereof), so an atmosphere can be detectable in the form of upwelling [[Infrared astronomy|infrared radiation]] because the greenhouse gases absorb and re-radiate energy from the host star.&lt;ref name="Seager 2013"/&gt; Ice-rich planets that have migrated inward into orbit too close to their host stars may develop thick steamy atmospheres but still retain their volatiles for billions of years, even if their atmospheres undergo slow [[Atmospheric escape|hydrodynamic escape]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planet Formation around Stars of Various Masses: The Snow Line and the Frequency of Giant Planets |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=20 January 2008 |last=Kennedy |first=Grant M. |last2=Kenyon |first2=Scott J |volume=673 |pages=502–512 |doi=10.1086/524130 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/524130/fulltext/ |accessdate=2017-10-04 |bibcode=2008ApJ...673..502K |arxiv=0710.1065 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuchner 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Volatile-rich Earth-Mass Planets in the Habitable Zone |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |date=10 October 2003 |last=Kuchner |first=Marc J. |volume=506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apj"/&gt;  [[Ultraviolet]] photons are not only biologically harmful but can drive fast atmospheric escape that leads to the erosion of planetary atmospheres;&lt;ref name=Luger/&gt;&lt;ref name="apj"/&gt; [[photolysis]] of water vapor, and hydrogen/oxygen escape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from planets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is energy-limited or diffusion-limited.&lt;ref name=Luger&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2014.1231 Extreme Water Loss and Abiotic O2 Buildup on Planets Throughout the Habitable Zones of M Dwarfs].

During a [[runaway greenhouse effect]], water vapor reaches the stratosphere, where it is easily broken down ([[Photodissociation|photolyzed]]) by ultraviolet radiation (UV). Heating of the upper atmosphere by UV radiation can then drive a hydrodynamic wind that carries the hydrogen (and potentially some of the oxygen) to space, leading to the irreversible loss of a planet's surface water, oxidation of the surface, and possible accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Luger/&gt; The fate of a given planet's atmosphere strongly depends on the extreme ultraviolet flux, the duration of the runaway regime, the initial water content, and the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the surface.&lt;ref name=Luger/&gt;  Volatile-rich planets should be more common in the habitable zones of young stars and [[Stellar classification#Class M|M-type stars]].&lt;ref name="apj"/&gt;

===Composition models===

There are challenges in examining an exoplanetary surface and its atmosphere, as cloud coverage influences the atmospheric temperature, structure as well as the observability of [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectral features]].&lt;ref name="Atmos chemistry"&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/775/2/L47/meta Water planets in the habitable zone: Atmospheric chemistry observable features, and the case of Kepler-62e and -62f]&lt;/ref&gt; However, planets composed of large quantities of water that reside in the habitable zone (HZ) are expected to have distinct geophysics and geochemistry of their surface and atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Atmos chemistry"/&gt; For example, in the case of exoplanets Kepler-62e and -62f, they could possess a liquid ocean outer surface, a steam atmosphere, or a full cover of surface [[Ice I]], depending on their orbit within the HZ and the magnitude of their [[greenhouse effect]]. Several other surface and interior processes affect the atmospheric composition, including but not limited to the ocean fraction for dissolution of {{chem|CO|2}} and for atmospheric relative humidity, [[redox]] state of the planetary surface and interior, acidity levels of the oceans, planetary [[albedo]], and surface gravity.&lt;ref name="Seager 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Kasting, D. Catling, ''Annu. Rev. Astron. Astrophys''. 41, 429 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The atmospheric structure, as well as the resulting HZ limits, depend on the density of a planet's atmosphere, shifting the HZ outward for lower mass and inward for higher mass planets.&lt;ref name="Atmos chemistry"/&gt;&lt;!--(see also: Kopparapu et al. 2013)--&gt; Theory, as well as computer models suggest that atmospheric composition for water planets in the habitable zone (HZ) should not differ substantially from those of land-ocean planets.&lt;ref name="Atmos chemistry"/&gt; For modeling purposes, it is assumed that the initial composition of icy [[planetesimal]]s that assemble into water planets is similar to that of comets: mostly water ({{chem|H|2|O}}), and some ammonia ([[Ammonia|{{chem|NH|3}}]]), and carbon dioxide ([[Carbon dioxide|{{chem|CO|2}}]]).&lt;ref name="Atmos chemistry"/&gt; An initial composition of ice similar to that of comets leads to an atmospheric model composition of 90% {{chem|H|2|O}}, 5% {{chem|NH|3}}, and 5% {{chem|CO|2}}.&lt;ref name="Atmos chemistry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2005.tb00960.x/full Origin of water in the terrestrial planets].

Atmospheric models for Kepler-62f show that an atmospheric pressure of between 1.6 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] and 5 bar of {{chem|CO|2}} are needed to warm the surface temperature above freezing, leading to a scaled surface pressure of 0.56–1.32 times Earth's.&lt;ref name="Atmos chemistry"/&gt;

The characteristics of ocean worlds or ocean planets provide clues to their history, and the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] as a whole.

'''Operation Fishbowl''' was a series of [[high-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear tests]] in 1962 that were carried out by the United States as a part of the larger ''[[Operation Dominic I and II|Operation Dominic]]'' nuclear test program. Flight-test vehicles were designed and manufactured by [[Avco Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/missilesrockets1519unse#page/n985/mode/2up Project Fishbowl: 13 weeks from go-ahead to field delivery]. // ''Missiles and Rockets'', December 21, 1964, v. 15, no. 25, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:fishbowlrockets.jpg|right|438px|thumb|Array of [[sounding rocket]]s with instruments for making scientific measurements of high-altitude nuclear tests during liftoff preparations on Johnston Island]]

==Introduction==
The ''Operation Fishbowl'' nuclear tests were originally planned to be completed during the first half of 1962 with three tests named ''Bluegill, Starfish'' and ''Urraca''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lewis, Jeffrey|year=2004|title=The minimum means of reprisal: China's search for security in the nuclear age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first test attempt was delayed until June.  Planning for ''Operation Fishbowl'', as well as many other nuclear tests in the region, was begun rapidly in response to the sudden [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] announcement on August 30, 1961 that they were ending a three-year moratorium on nuclear testing.&lt;ref name="NWA.org"&gt;{{cite web|
title=Operation Dominic|
url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Dominic.html|
publisher=Nuclear Weapon Archive|
accessdate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid planning of very complex operations necessitated many changes as the project progressed.

All of the tests were to be launched on missiles from [[Johnston Island]] in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator. Johnston Island had already been established as a launch site for United States high-altitude nuclear tests, rather than the other locations in the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]]. In 1958, [[Lewis Strauss]], then chairman of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]], opposed doing any high-altitude tests at locations that had been used for earlier Pacific nuclear tests.  His opposition was motivated by fears that the flash from the nighttime high-altitude detonations might blind civilians who were living on nearby islands. Johnston Island was a remote location, more distant from populated areas than other potential test locations.&lt;ref name="DNA1"&gt;''Defense's Nuclear Agency 1947&amp;ndash;1997''. Page 139. Defense Threat Reduction Agency, 2002 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090320075426/http://www.dtra.mil/newsservices/publications/pub_includes/docs/DefensesNuclearAgency.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect residents of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] from [[flash blindness]] or permanent [[retina]]l injury from the bright nuclear flash, the nuclear missiles of ''Operation Fishbowl'' were launched generally toward the southwest of Johnston Island so that the detonations would be farther from Hawaii.

{{anchor|Urraca}}
''Urraca'' was to be a test of about 1 megaton yield at very high altitude (above 1000&amp;nbsp;km.).&lt;ref name="LT_cb"&gt;Conrad, Edward E., et al. "Collateral Damage to Satellites from an EMP Attack" Report DTRA-IR-10-22, Defense Threat Reduction Agency. August 2010 [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA531197&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf] (Retrieved January 20, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed ''Urraca'' test was always controversial, especially after the damage caused to satellites by the ''[[Starfish Prime]]'' detonation, as described below.  ''Urraca'' was finally canceled, and an extensive re-evaluation of the ''Operation Fishbowl'' plan was made during an 82-day operations pause after the ''Bluegill Prime'' disaster of July 25, 1962, as described below.

A test named ''Kingfish'' was added during the early stages of ''Operation Fishbowl'' planning. Two low-yield tests, ''Checkmate'' and ''Tightrope'', were also added during the project, so the final number of tests in ''Operation Fishbowl'' was five.

==Research directions==
The United States completed six high-altitude nuclear tests in 1958, but the high-altitude tests of that year raised a number of questions. According to U.S. Government Report ADA955694 on the first successful test of the Fishbowl series, "Previous high-altitude nuclear tests: ''[[Hardtack Teak|Teak]]'', ''[[Operation Hardtack I|Orange]]'', and ''[[Yucca]]'', plus the three ''[[Operation Argus|ARGUS]]'' shots were poorly instrumented and hastily executed.  Despite thorough studies of the meager data, present models of these bursts are sketchy and tentative.  These models are too uncertain to permit extrapolation to other altitudes and yields with any confidence. Thus there is a strong need, not only for better instrumentation, but for further tests covering a range of altitudes and yields."&lt;ref&gt;Defense Atomic Support Agency. Project Officer's Interim Report:  STARFISH Prime. Report ADA955694. August 1962 [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA955694&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three phenomena in particular that required further investigation:

1. The [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] generated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion appeared to have very significant differences from the electromagnetic pulse generated by nuclear explosions closer to the surface.

2. The [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroras]] associated with high-altitude nuclear explosions, especially the auroras that appeared almost instantaneously far away from the explosion in the opposite hemisphere, were not clearly understood.  The nature of the possible radiation belts that were initially generated along the magnetic field lines connecting the areas of the auroral displays were also poorly understood.

3. Areas of [[Communications blackout|blackout]] of [[radio communication]] needed to be understood in much more detail since that information would be critical for military operations during periods of possible nuclear explosions.

The ''Fishbowl'' tests were monitored by a large number of surface and aircraft-based stations in the wide area around the planned detonations and also in the region in the southern hemisphere in the [[Samoan Islands]] region, which was known in these tests as the '''southern conjugate region'''.  Johnston Island is in the northern hemisphere, as were all of the planned ''Operation Fishbowl'' nuclear detonation locations.  It was known from previous high altitude tests, as well as from theoretical work done in the late 1950s, that high-altitude nuclear tests produce a number of unique geophysical phenomena at the opposite end of the magnetic field line of the [[Earth's magnetic field]].

&lt;div style="clear:both"  &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
[[File:Pacific Fishbowl.png|right|518px|thumb|The red burst southwest of Johnston Island indicates the typical detonation point for the ''Operation Fishbowl'' tests, and the blue round spot southeast of Fiji indicates the southern magnetic conjugate region where additional auroras were expected and were actually observed. The southern conjugate region is not directly south of the detonation point since the Earth's magnetic field lines do not run in a geographically north-south direction. Also, the magnetic equator of the Earth in this region is slightly to the south of the geographic equator. The detonation point and southern conjugate region were taken from Figure 3 of planning report ADA469481, which was originally a hand-drawn planning map for the ''Bluegill'' test.&lt;ref name="ada469481"&gt;Air Force Special Weapons Center.

The first ''Bluegill'' test failed, and the successful ''Bluegill Triple Prime'' test detonated at a point closer to Johnston Island.]]

According to the standard reference book on nuclear weapon effects by the [[United States Department of Defense]], "For the high-altitude tests conducted in 1958 and 1962 in the vicinity of Johnston Island, the charged particles entered the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere between Johnston Island and the main [[Hawaiian Islands]], whereas the '''conjugate region''' was in the vicinity of the [[Samoan Islands|Samoan]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tonga]] Islands.  It is in these areas that [[auroras]] were actually observed, in addition to those in the areas of the nuclear explosions."&lt;ref name="glass-dol"&gt;Glasstone, Samuel and Dolan, Philip J., ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons''. Chapter 2, sections 2.144 and 2.145. United States Department of Defense. 1977.

[[Beta particles]] are charged particles (usually with a negative [[electrical charge]]) that are released from nuclear explosions.  These particles travel in a spiral along the [[field line|magnetic field lines]] in the Earth's magnetic field. The nuclear explosions also release heavier debris [[ion]]s, which also carry an electrical charge, and which also travel in a spiral along the Earth's magnetic field lines.

The Earth's magnetic field lines arc high above the Earth until they reach the '''magnetic conjugate area''' in the opposite hemisphere.

According to the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] nuclear weapon effects reference, "Because the [[beta particles]] have high velocities, the beta auroras in the remote (southern) hemisphere appeared within a fraction of a second of those in the hemisphere where the burst had occurred.  The debris ions, however, travel more slowly and so the debris aurora in the remote hemisphere, if it is formed, appears at a somewhat later time.  The beta auroras are generally most intense at an altitude of 30 to 60 miles, whereas the intensity of the debris auroras is greatest in the 60 to 125 miles range.  Remote conjugate beta auroras can occur if the detonation is above 25 miles, whereas debris auroras appear only if the detonation altitude is in excess of some 200 miles."&lt;ref name="glass-dol"/&gt;

Some of the charged particles traveling along the Earth's magnetic field lines cause auroras and other geophysical phenomena in the conjugate areas.  Other charged particles are reflected back along the magnetic field lines, where they can persist for long periods of time (up to several months or longer), forming [[List of artificial radiation belts|artificial radiation belts]].&lt;ref name="LA6405"&gt;Hoerlin, Herman "United States High-Altitude Test Experiences: A Review Emphasizing the Impact on the Environment" Report LA-6405, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory.

According to the ''Operation Fishbowl'' planning document of November 1961, "Since much valuable data can be obtained from time and spectrum resolved photography, this dictates that the test be performed at nighttime when auroral photographic conditions are best."&lt;ref name="ada469481"/&gt; As with all U.S. Pacific high-altitude nuclear tests, all of the ''Operation Fishbowl'' tests were completed at night. This is in contrast to the high-altitude nuclear tests of the [[Soviet Project K nuclear tests]], which were done over the populated land region of central [[Kazakhstan]], and therefore had to be done during the daytime to avoid eyeburn damage to the population from the very bright flash of high-altitude nuclear explosions (as discussed in the introduction to this article).

==First attempts==
[[File:Thor-PGM-17.jpg|right|409px|thumb|The [[PGM-17 Thor]] missile shown here is very similar to the Thor missile used for the launch of the nuclear warhead in all attempts of the ''Bluegill, Starfish'' and ''Kingfish'' nuclear tests of ''Operation Fishbowl'']]
According to the initial plan of ''Operation Fishbowl'', the nuclear tests were to be ''Bluegill'', ''Starfish'' and ''Urraca'', in that order. If a test were to fail, the next attempt of the same test would be of the same name plus the word "prime." If ''Bluegill'' failed, the next attempt would be ''Bluegill Prime'', and if ''Bluegill Prime'' failed, the next attempt would be ''Bluegill Double Prime'', etc.

===Bluegill===
The first planned test of ''Operation Fishbowl'' was on June 2, 1962 when a nuclear warhead was launched from Johnston Island on a [[Thor (rocket family)|''Thor'']] missile just after midnight.  Although the ''Thor'' missile appeared to be on a normal trajectory, the radar tracking system lost track of the missile.  Because of the large number of ships and aircraft in the area, there was no way to predict if the missile was on a safe trajectory, so the range safety officers ordered the missile with its warhead to be destroyed.  No nuclear detonation occurred and no data were obtained, but subsequent investigation found that the Thor was actually following the proper flight trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Nuclear Agency.

===Starfish===
The second planned test of ''Operation Fishbowl'' was on June 19, 1962. The launch of a ''Thor'' missile with a nuclear warhead occurred just before midnight from Johnston Island. The ''Thor'' missile flew a normal trajectory for 59 seconds; then the rocket engine suddenly stopped, and the missile began to break apart. The range safety officer ordered the destruction of the missile and the warhead. The missile was between 30,000 and 35,000 feet (between 9.1 and 10.7&amp;nbsp;km) in altitude when it was destroyed.

Some of the missile parts fell on Johnston Island, and a large amount of missile debris fell into the ocean in the vicinity of the island. Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Underwater Demolition Team swimmers recovered approximately 250 pieces of the missile assembly during the next two weeks. Some of the debris was contaminated with [[plutonium]]. Nonessential personnel had been evacuated from Johnston Island during the test.

===Starfish Prime===
{{Main article|Starfish Prime}}
On July 9, 1962, at 09:00:09 [[Coordinated Universal Time]], which was nine seconds after 10 p.m. on July 8, Johnston Island local time, the ''[[Starfish Prime]]'' test was successfully detonated at an altitude of {{convert|400|km}}. The coordinates of the detonation were 16 degrees, 28 minutes North latitude, 169 degrees, 38 minutes West longitude (30&amp;nbsp;km, or about 18&amp;nbsp;mi, southwest of Johnston Island).&lt;ref name="vittitoe"&gt;Vittitoe, Charles N., "Did High-Altitude EMP Cause the Hawaiian Streetlight Incident?" Sandia National Laboratories. June 1989. [http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/SDAN/0031.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual weapon yield was very close to the design yield, which has been described by various sources at different values in the very narrow range of 1.4 to 1.45 [[Nuclear weapon yield|megatons]] (6.0 PJ).

The ''Thor'' missile carrying the Starfish Prime warhead actually reached an apogee (maximum height) of about 1100&amp;nbsp;km (just over 680 miles), and the warhead was detonated on its downward trajectory when it had fallen to the programmed altitude of {{convert|400|km}}. The nuclear warhead detonated at 13 minutes and 41 seconds after liftoff of the Thor missile.&lt;ref&gt;Dyal, P., Air Force Weapons Laboratory. Report ADA995428. "Operation Dominic. Fish Bowl Series.

''Starfish Prime'' caused an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) which was far larger than expected, so much larger that it drove much of the instrumentation off scale, causing great difficulty in getting accurate measurements.  The ''Starfish Prime'' electromagnetic pulse also made those effects known to the public by causing electrical damage in Hawaii, about {{convert|1445|km|-1}} away from the detonation point, knocking out about 300 streetlights, setting off numerous burglar alarms and damaging a telephone company microwave link&lt;ref name="vittitoe"/&gt; (the detonation time was nine seconds after 11 p.m. in Hawaii).

A total of 27 small rockets were launched from Johnston Island to obtain experimental data from the shot, with the first of the support rockets being launched 2 hours and 45 minutes before the launch of the Thor missile carrying the nuclear warhead.  Most of these smaller instrumentation rockets were launched just after the time of the launch of the main Thor missile carrying the warhead. In addition, a large number of rocket-borne instruments were launched from a firing area at [[Barking Sands Missile Base|Barking Sands]], [[Kauai]], in the Hawaiian Islands.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Defense.

A very large number of United States military ships and aircraft were operating in support of ''Starfish Prime'' in the Johnston Island area and across the nearby North Pacific region, including the primary instrumentation ship [[USAS American Mariner]] providing measurements conducted by personnel provided by RCA Service Company and Barnes Engineering Company. A few military ships and aircraft were also positioned in the southern conjugate region for the test, which was near the Samoan Islands.  In addition, an uninvited observation ship from the [[Soviet Union]] was stationed near Johnston Island for the test and another Soviet scientific expeditionary ship was located in the southern conjugate region,&lt;ref&gt;United States Central Intelligence Agency.

After the ''Starfish Prime'' detonation, bright auroras were observed in the detonation area as well as in the southern conjugate region on the other side of the equator from the detonation.  According to one of the first technical reports, "The visible phenomena due to the burst were widespread and quite intense; a very large area of the Pacific was illuminated by the auroral phenomena, from far south of the south magnetic conjugate area ([[Tongatapu]]) through the burst area to far north of the north conjugate area ([[French Frigate Shoals]]). ... At twilight after the burst, resonant scattering of light from [[lithium]] and other debris was observed at Johnston and French Frigate Shoals for many days confirming the longtime presence of debris in the atmosphere. An interesting side effect was that the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] was aided in anti-submarine maneuvers by the light from the bomb."&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Defense.

The ''Starfish Prime'' radiation belt persisted at high altitude for many months and damaged the United States satellites [[Transit Research and Attitude Control|''Traac'']], [[Transit (satellite)|''Transit&amp;nbsp;4B'']], [[Injun (satellite)|''Injun&amp;nbsp;I'']] and [[Telstar|''Telstar&amp;nbsp;I'']], as well as the United Kingdom satellite [[Ariel 1|''Ariel'']].

===Bluegill Prime===
[[File:Dominic Bluegill Prime radiation cleanup.jpg|right|480px|thumb|Inspection of ''Thor'' engine parts after the [[radioactive contamination]] following the ''Bluegill Prime'' fire on Johnston Island.]] On July 25, 1962, a second attempt was made to launch the ''Bluegill'' device, but ended in disaster when the Thor suffered a stuck valve preventing the flow of LOX to the combustion chamber. The engine lost thrust and unburned RP-1 spilled down into the hot thrust chamber, igniting and starting a fire around the base of the missile. With the Thor engulfed in flames, the Range Safety Officer sent the destruct command, which split the rocket and ruptured both fuel tanks, completely destroying the missile and badly damaging the launch pad. The warhead charges also exploded asymmetrically and sprayed the area with the moderately radioactive core materials.

Although there was little danger of an accidental nuclear explosion, the destruction of the nuclear warhead on the launch pad caused contamination of the area by alpha-emitting core materials. Burning rocket fuel, flowing through the cable trenches, caused extensive chemical contamination of the trenches and the equipment associated with the cabling in the trenches.

The radioactive contamination on Johnston Island was determined to be a major problem, and it was necessary to decontaminate the entire area before the badly damaged launch pad could be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Defense Nuclear Agency.

==Operations pause==
''Operation Fishbowl'' test operations stopped after the disastrous failure of ''Bluegill Prime'', and most of the personnel not directly involved in the radioactive cleanup and launch pad rebuild on Johnston Island returned to their home stations to await the resumption of tests.

According to the ''Operation Dominic I'' report, "The enforced pause allowed [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] to replan the remainder of the ''Fishbowl'' series. The ''Urraca'' event was canceled to avoid further damage to satellites and three new shots were added."&lt;ref&gt;Defense Nuclear Agency. ''Operation Dominic I''. 1962. Report DNA 6040F.

==Continuation of the Fishbowl series==
After a pause of nearly three months, ''Operation Fishbowl'' was ready to continue, beginning with another attempt at the ''Bluegill'' test.

===Bluegill Double Prime===
Eighty-two days after the failure of ''Bluegill Prime'', about 30 minutes before midnight on the night of October 15, 1962, local Johnston Island time (October 16 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), another attempt was made at the ''Bluegill'' test. The ''Thor'' missile malfunctioned and began tumbling out of control about 85 seconds after launch, and the range safety officer ordered the destruction of the missile and its nuclear warhead about 95 seconds after launch.&lt;ref name="dtra.mil"&gt;Defense Nuclear Agency. Operation Dominic I. 1962. Report DNA 6040F. (First published as an unclassified document on February 1, 1983.)

===Checkmate===
On October 19, 1962, at about 90 minutes before midnight (local Johnston Island time), an XM-33 ''[[Strypi]]'' rocket launched a low-yield nuclear warhead which detonated successfully at an altitude of {{convert|147|km|mi}}. It was reported that the yield and burst altitude were very close to those desired, but according to most official documents the exact nuclear yield remains classified. It is reported in the open literature as simply being less than 20 kilotons. One report by the U.S. federal government, however, reported the Checkmate test yield as 10 kilotons.&lt;ref name="ada995365"&gt;Allen, R.G., Jr., Project Officer. Report ADA995365. "Operation Dominic: Christmas and Fish Bowl Series. Project Officers Report. Project 4.1" March 30, 1965. Page 17. [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA995365&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that, "Observers on Johnston Island saw a green and blue circular region surrounded by a blood-red ring formed overhead that faded in less than 1 minute. Blue-green streamers and numerous pink striations formed, the latter lasting for 30 minutes. Observers at Samoa saw a white flash, which faded to orange and disappeared in about 1 minute."&lt;ref name="dtra.mil"/&gt;

===Bluegill Triple Prime===
The fourth attempt at the ''Bluegill'' test was launched on a ''Thor'' missile on October 25, 1962 (Johnston Island time).  It resulted in a successful detonation of a submegaton nuclear warhead at about one minute before midnight, local time (the official [[Coordinated Universal Time]] was 0959 on October 26, 1962). It was officially reported as being in the submegaton range (meaning more than 200 kilotons but less than one megaton), and most observers of the U.S. nuclear testing programs believe that the nuclear yield was about 400 kilotons.&lt;ref name="johnstons"&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/hane.html Johnston's Archive. High Altitude Nuclear Explosions]&lt;/ref&gt; One report by the U.S. federal government reported the test yield as 200 kilotons.&lt;ref name="ada995365"/&gt;

Since all of the Operation Fishbowl tests were planned to occur during the night, the potential for eyeburn, especially for permanent retinal damage, was an important consideration at all levels of planning. Much research went into the potential eyeburn problem.  One of the official reports for the project stated that, for the altitudes planned for the ''Bluegill, Kingfish'' and ''Checkmate'' tests, "the thermal-pulse durations are of the same order of magnitude or shorter than the natural blink period which, for the average person, is about 150 milliseconds. Furthermore, the atmospheric attenuation is normally much less for a given distance than in the case of sea-level or near-sea-level explosions. Consequently, the eye-damage hazard is more severe."&lt;ref name="LA6405"/&gt;

Two cases of retinal damage did occur with military personnel on Johnston Island during the '''Bluegill Triple Prime''' test. Neither individual had his protective goggles in place at the instant of the detonation. One official report stated, "In the first case, acuity for central vision was 20/400 initially, but returned to 20/25 by six months. The second victim was less fortunate, as central vision did not improve beyond 20/60. The lesion diameters were 0.35 and 0.50 mm respectively. Both individuals noted immediate visual disturbances, but neither was incapacitated."&lt;ref name="LA6405"/&gt;

There had been concern that eyeburn problems might occur during the earlier ''Starfish Prime'' test, since the countdown was rebroadcast by radio stations in Hawaii, and many civilians would be watching the thermonuclear detonation as it occurred,&lt;ref name="LA6405"/&gt; but no such problems in Hawaii were reported.

===Kingfish===
The ''Kingfish'' detonation occurred at 0210 (Johnston Island time) on November 1, 1962 and was the fourth successful detonation of the Fishbowl series. It was officially reported only as being a submegaton explosion (meaning in the range of more than 200 kilotons, but less than a megaton), but most independent observers believe that it used the same 400 kiloton warhead as the ''Bluegill Triple Prime'' test,&lt;ref name="johnstons"/&gt; although one report by the U.S. federal government reported the test yield as 200 kilotons.&lt;ref name="ada995365"/&gt;

As with the other Fishbowl tests, a number of small rockets with various scientific instrumentation were launched from Johnson Island to monitor the effects of the high-altitude explosion.  In the case of the Kingfish test, 29 rockets were launched from Johnston Island in addition to the Thor rocket carrying the nuclear warhead.&lt;ref name="dominic247"&gt;Defense Nuclear Agency. Operation Dominic I 1962. Report DNA 6040F. (First published as an unclassified document on February 1, 1983.) Page 247. {{cite web |url=http://www.dtra.mil/documents/ntpr/historical/T24298.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 12, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823152154/http://www.dtra.mil/documents/ntpr/historical/T24298.pdf |archivedate=August 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
According to the official report, at the time of the ''Kingfish'' detonation, "Johnston Island observers saw a yellow-white, luminous circle with intense purple streamers for the first minute. Some of the streamers displayed what appeared to be a rapid twisting motion at times. A large pale-green patch appeared somewhat south of the burst and grew, becoming the dominant visible feature after 5 minutes. By H+1 the green had become dull gray, but the feature persisted for 3 hours. At [[Oahu]] a bright flash was observed and after about 10 seconds a great white ball appeared to rise slowly out of the sea and was visible for about 9 minutes."&lt;ref name="dominic247"/&gt;

After most of the electromagnetic pulse measurements on Starfish Prime had failed because the EMP was so much larger than expected, extra care was taken to obtain accurate EMP measurements on the Bluegill Triple Prime and Kingfish tests. The EMP mechanism that had been hypothesized before ''Operation Fishbowl'' had been conclusively disproven by the ''Starfish Prime'' test. Prompt gamma ray output measurements on these later tests were also carefully obtained so that a new theory of the mechanism for high-altitude EMP could be developed and confirmed.  That new theory about the generation of nuclear EMP was developed by Los Alamos physicist [[Conrad Longmire]] in 1963, and it is the high-altitude nuclear EMP theory that is still used today.&lt;ref name="nbcreport"&gt;Longmire, Conrad L., "Fifty Odd Years of EMP", NBC Report, Fall/Winter, 2004. pp. 47-51. U.S. Army Nuclear and Chemical Agency   [http://www.futurescience.com/emp/NBC_Report_Fall_Winter04.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the beginning of 2011, the EMP waveforms and prompt gamma radiation outputs for ''Bluegill Triple Prime'' and ''Kingfish'' remain classified. An unclassified report, however, confirms that these measurements were successfully made and that a subsequent theory (which is the one now used) was developed which describes the mechanism by which the high-altitude EMP is generated. That new theory does give results which are consistent with both the ''Bluegill Triple Prime'' and ''Kingfish'' data.&lt;ref name="tn368"&gt;Longmire, Conrad L., Theoretical Note 368. "Justification and Verification of High-Altitude EMP Theory, Part 1." Mission Research Corporation/Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. June 1986. Page 3. [http://www.ece.unm.edu/summa/notes/TheoreticalPDFs/TN368.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (The report actually using the ''Bluegill Triple Prime'' and ''Kingfish data'' to confirm the new EMP theory is the still-classified Part 2 of the unclassified report by Conrad Longmire.)&lt;ref name="tn368"/&gt;

According to a Sandia National Laboratories report, EMP generated during the ''Operation Fishbowl'' tests caused "... input circuit troubles in radio receivers during the ''Starfish'' and ''Checkmat''e bursts; the triggering of surge arresters on an airplane with a trailing-wire antenna during Starfish, Checkmate, and Bluegill; and the Oahu streetlight incident."&lt;ref name="vittitoe"/&gt; (The "Oahu streetlight incident" refers to the 300 streetlights in Honolulu extinguished by the Starfish Prime detonation.)

===Tightrope===
The final test of Operation Fishbowl was detonated at 2130 (9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local Johnston Island time) on November 3, 1962 (the time and date was officially recorded as 0730 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], November 4, 1962). It was launched on a [[MIM-14 Nike-Hercules|Nike-Hercules]] missile, and detonated at a lower altitude than the other Fishbowl tests. Although it was officially one of the Operation Fishbowl tests, it is sometimes not listed among high-altitude nuclear tests because of its lower detonation altitude. The nuclear yield was reported in most official documents only as being less than 20 kilotons. One report by the U.S. federal government reported the ''Tightrope'' test yield as 10 kilotons.&lt;ref name="ada995365"/&gt;

"At Johnston Island, there was an intense white flash. Even with high-density goggles, the burst was too bright to view, even for a few seconds. A distinct thermal pulse was also felt on the bare skin. A yellow-orange disc was formed, which transformed itself into a purple doughnut. A glowing purple cloud was faintly visible for a few minutes."&lt;ref name="dominic247"/&gt;

Seven rockets carrying scientific instrumentation were launched from Johnston Island in support of the ''Tightrope'' test, which was the final atmospheric test conducted by the United States.

 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar energy potential in Turkey is 977,000 (TWh/year) from which 6105 (TWh/year) is technically possible. However due to the high price of the solar energy only 305 (TWh/year) is economic potential.Wind energy technical potential is 290 TWh/year.

'''Sidney William Jackson''' (12 June 1873 – 30 September 1946) was an [[Australia]]n [[natural history|naturalist]] and field [[ornithology|ornithologist]] with a special interest in [[oology]], who was also a skilled [[photography|photographer]] and [[taxidermy|taxidermist]].

==History==
Jackson was born in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], and educated at [[Toowoomba Grammar School]] and in [[Grafton, New South Wales]].  From his youth he developed an interest in [[bird]]s and in collecting their eggs.  Based in Grafton, for many years he worked as a commercial traveller, giving him the opportunity to build up a large collection of birds' eggs.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;Mathews (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whittell&gt;Whittell (1954), pp.369-372.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although his field activities were mainly focussed on bird and egg specimens, he also collected [[land snail]]s and [[botany|botanical]] specimens.  He was a skillful tree-climber and developed, with the help of his brother Frank, techniques for climbing trees, using leg-spikes and rope-ladders, as aids to egg-collecting.&lt;ref name=Robin/&gt;

Jackson contributed several papers to the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union|RAOU]] [[scientific journal|journal]] ''[[Emu (journal)|The Emu]]''.  He was a diligent diarist, correspondent, photographer and talented sketcher, whose diaries, as well as much of his correspondence, photographic negatives and drawings, eventually found their way to the [[National Library of Australia]] in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm (1958), pp.101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also authored a book, ''[[Egg Collecting and Bird Life of Australia]]'', a combined autobiographical work and oological catalogue, illustrated with his own photographs, which was published in 1907.&lt;ref name=Whittell/&gt;

In 1906 Jackson had sold his collection of nearly 2000 eggs, representing over 500 species of Australian birds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=201–205|journal=Emu|title=Review of ''Catalogue and Data of the Jacksonian Oological Collection''|date=1 April 1908|volume=vol. 7|doi=10.1071/MU907197|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112009338796;view=1up;seq=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Henry Luke White|H.L. White]], a wealthy [[pastoral farming|pastoralist]] based at [[Scone, New South Wales]] who was a keen amateur ornithologist and oologist.  In 1907 White then employed Jackson as curator of his [[H. L. White Collection|collection]] of eggs and bird skins, as well as a collector of further specimens.  During this period Jackson travelled extensively throughout Australia on quests to obtain specimens and eggs of various birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacskon, S. W.|title= A Trip to the Upper Hunter River District, New South Wales|journal=Emu|volume= 8|date=1 July 1908|pages=11–18|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112009338853;view=1up;seq=25|doi=10.1071/mu908011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following White’s death in 1927, Jackson moved to [[Sydney]] where he wrote popular illustrated articles on natural history for newspapers and magazines, mainly the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and the ''World's News'', using the [[pen name]] ‘Ajax’.&lt;ref name=Whittell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robin&gt;Robin (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ornithological historian [[Alexander Hugh Chisholm|Alec Chisholm]], in an article about Jackson’s diaries in ''The Emu'', described Jackson, whom he knew personally, as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;”Inevitably, the diaries and correspondence reflect the character of their author.  Jackson was an odd mixture.  A keen observer and most diligent worker, he was extremely temperamental – apt to be completely downcast at one moment and thoroughly joyful soon afterwards.  In some respects he was entirely humourless, and yet he could be highly entertaining when giving performances of ventriloquism and mimicry, added to which he had a child-like fondness for those trivial gadgets (such as a piece of tin shaped and painted to resemble spilt ink) that alarm or embarrass unwary people.  Practical and self-reliant in the bush, he was just the reverse in matters of business, and so he was frequently in trouble, financial and otherwise.  The one factor that sustained him during tribulations, and also caused him to exaggerate his own achievements, was a strong strain of egotism.  This failing, if occasionally provoking, was quite naive in his case, and so was tolerated by all who knew him well – H.L. White included – though they regretted to see it leading him, at times, into childish absurdities.  Inevitably, the same weakness is manifest in every diary and almost every letter of the collection now at Canberra, and in some instances the remarks are distinctly quaint.&lt;br/&gt;

“The fact appears to be that Jackson, through experiencing much solitude in the bush, had become lonely and introspective, and so took to indulging in self-pity and self-congratulation.  Like various other bush-wanderers before his time, he ‘talked’ to his diaries, and, even though we may smile at certain comments, it has to be conceded that such highly personal touches make the entries more ‘human’ than matter-of-fact narratives.”&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm (1958), pp.102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
''[[Eucalyptus jacksonii]]'' was named in honour of Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eucalyptus jacksonii Maiden|url=http://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:apni.taxon:305573|website=The Atlas Of Living Australia|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sidney William Jackson|url=http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P000517b.htm|website=Encyclopedia of Australian Science|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Strawberry Tree''' is the world’s first public [[solar energy|solar]] [[battery charger|charger]] for [[mobile devices]]. It was developed by [[Serbia]]n company Strawberry Energy. It won first place in the European Commission’s "Sustainable energy week 2011" competition in Brussels, in the category ''Consuming''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusew.eu/index.php?option=com_see_eventview&amp;view=see_eventdetail&amp;eventid=1711 Strawberry Tree: Exclusive Showcase in Brussels]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eusew.eu/awards2011-consuming Sustainable energy week awards 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-13805010 Students invent first public solar-powered mobile charger]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionalities ==

Strawberry Tree is a solar and WiFi station which is permanently installed in public places such as streets, parks and squares, providing passersby with the opportunity to charge their mobile devices for free when they are outside. Its main parts are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecofriend.com/strawberry-tree-solar-powered-charging-booth-for-small-gadgets.html Strawberry Tree – Solar powered charging booth for small gadgets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarlighting-s.com/solar-powered-charger/  Strawberry Tree by Strawberry Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarpanelsuk.co.uk/news/?p=1836 The “Strawberry Tree” That Provides Solar Power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://techland.time.com/2011/06/17/strawberry-tree-a-free-public-solar-powered-charging-station/ Strawberry Tree: A Free, Public, Solar-Powered Charging Station]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Solar panels that transform solar energy to electrical energy
* Rechargeable batteries which accumulate energy and make Strawberry Tree function for more than 14 days without sunshine
* Sixteen cords for different types of mobile devices such as mobile phones, cameras, mp3 players etc.
* Smart electronics which enables balance between produced and consumed energy

Also, Strawberry Tree provides free wireless internet in the immediate surroundings.

== History ==
The first idea of a public solar charger for mobile devices, Strawberry tree was developed by Miloš Milisavljević, founder of Strawberry Energy company.

{{As of|2013}}, there were eleven Strawberry Trees installed. The first Strawberry Tree was installed in October, 2010 in the main square of Obrenovac municipality, Serbia. During the first 40 days from presentation of the solar charger, 10,000 chargings were measured. One year later, in cooperation with [[Telekom Srbija|Telekom Serbia Company]], a second Public solar charger for mobile devices was set up in Zvezdara municipality, Belgrade, Serbia. In the same month, a third Strawberry Tree was set in Novi Sad, Serbia. By the beginning of 2012, more than 100,000 chargings had been achieved on all three Strawberry trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2012/01/04/innovative-solar-energy-tech/ Four Innovative Solar Tech Projects From Around the World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovationfund.rs/category/portfolio/the-strawberry-tree/ The Strawberry Tree-the first public solar charger]&lt;/ref&gt;

In cooperation with [[Telekom Srbija|Telekom Serbia Company]], Strawberry energy also installed Strawberry Tree at these locations:

*Kikinda, Serbia, in July, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telekom.rs/telekomeng/Contents/Content8.aspx?sid=72&amp;id=78&amp;cid=52335 mt:s presents solar charger for mobile handsets to citizens of Kikinda]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vranje, Serbia, in August, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cellular-news.com/story/56152.php Solar Powered Strawberry Tree Installed in Serbia]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bor, Serbia, in October, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telecompaper.com/news/telekom-srbija-installs-solar-mobile-charger-in-bor--900282 Telekom Srbija installs solar mobile charger in Bor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In cooperation with city of Belgrade and Palilula municipaluty, Strawberry energy installed Strawberry Tree Black in Belgrade in Tašmajdan Park, in November 2012, with a completely new design by Serbian architect Miloš Milivojević.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/cleantech/post-sandy-wish-list-solar-powered-public-chargers/ Post Sandy wish list-solar powered public chargers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of 2013, Strawberry energy, in cooperation with the city of Belgrade and Mikser organization, set up Public solar charger Strawberry Tree Flow with the new design by Serbian designers Tamara Švonja and Vojin Stojadinović, in Slavija square, Belgrade, Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inhabitat.com/strawberry-tree-flow-solar-power-park-invites-passersby-to-charge-their-gadgets-in-belgrade/ Strawberry Tree Flow: Solar Power Park Invites Passersby to Charge their Gadgets in Belgrade]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2013, through the project ‘Bijeljina and Bogatić - together on the way towards energy sustainability through increasing energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy sources’ within Cross Border Cooperation Programme Serbia – Bosnia and Herzegovina, two solar chargers have been installed in Bijeljina: in front of Cultural center and in the City park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srb-bih.org/?p=1120&amp;lang=en As a part of the project, Bijeljina has installed two “Strawberry Tree” solar chargers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Territorialisation of Carbon Governance''' (ToCG) is a concept used in [[political geography]] or [[environmental policy]] which is considered to be a new logic of [[environmental governance]]. This method creates carbon-relevant citizens who become enrolled in the process of governing the [[climate]].&lt;ref name="Rice2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rice|first=J L|title=Climate, Carbon, and Territory: Greenhouse Gas Mitigation in Seattle, Washington|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|year=2010|volume=100|issue=4|pages=929–937|doi=10.1080/00045608.2010.502434}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territorialisation of carbon governance transforms [[climate change]] from a global to local issue. It embodies political practices that serve to connect the causes and consequences of [[global climate change]] to local communities.

The commitment to reducing [[greenhouse gas emissions]] (GHG) has been a key component of [[sustainability]] within governance since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=While|first=A|author2=Jonas, A |author3=E, G |author4=Gibbs, D |title=From sustainable development to carbon control: eco state restructuring and the politics of urban and regional development|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year=2010|volume=35|issue=1|pages=76–93|doi=10.1111/j.1475-5661.2009.00362.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ICLEI]] - Local Governments for Sustainability is an international association of local governments which brings together 1200 cities, towns and the associated 70 countries in their commitment to sustainable development. Further responses that seek to address these issues, include international body the IPCC [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the [[Rio Earth Summit]] and [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). These organisations strive to tackle [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] forces which are increasing risks of [[global warming]].

Under the territorialisation of carbon, climate and global flows of [[carbon]] are regarded as ‘national sinks’.&lt;ref name="Lövbrand2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lövbrand|first=E|author2=Stripple, J |title=The climate as political space: on the territorialisation of the global carbon cycle|journal=Review of International Studies|year=2006|volume=36|issue=2|pages=217–235|doi=10.1017/S0260210506006991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a means by which the [[carbon cycle]] can be managed and territorialised through being assigned to a physical geographical space instead of being thought of as a global phenomenon. The act of territorialisation oversees the combining of material natures and state institutions into one system through the creation of carbon territories.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; This approach can allow individual states and governments to control and monitor their carbon emissions in order to improve their efforts in carbon governance.

Carbon governance can be interpreted as the institutional arrangements under which greenhouse gas emissions are addressed and mitigated. This is achieved through regulating and controlling carbon activities. Measures and protocols exist in an attempt to address the issues surrounding greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon governance is addressed via governmental decisions made through leadership and management which attempt to improve and resolve problems related to climate change.

== Background and history ==
ToCG finds its origin in the problem of global climate change. Climate change is often referred to as a global ‘commons’ problem whereby individuals are unlikely to take responsibility for the global accumulation of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lutsey|first=N|author2=Sperling, D |title=America's bottom-up climate change mitigation policy|journal=Energy Policy|year=2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=673–685|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmosphere is shared by everybody resulting in the impacts of climate change and emissions being felt everywhere irrelevant of their origin.&lt;ref name="stripple2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stripple|first=J|title=Governing climate,(b) ordering the world|year=2008|publisher=[[Earthscan]]|location=UK|pages=137–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this problem are that to slow down global warming, ‘top-down’ international treaties must be signed.  This idea can be related to the ‘[[Tragedy of the Commons]]’ since the world contains multiple nation-states all acting with self-interest yet sharing one resource. The shared resource being exploited in this example can be represented by the atmosphere and the subsequent increase in global temperature is the result.

In an attempt to combat and tackle these issues protocols and measures have been deployed. The 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] is an international agreement which sets binding targets in reducing GHG emissions. This treaty demonstrates a global approach to carbon governance.  While this is legally binding to participating nation states it is due to expire in 2012. However the United States, the world's most historical emitter of GHG emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC Science and Technology|first=BBC|title=Climate change: The big emitters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3143798.stm|accessdate=20 May 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol. The [[Copenhagen Accord]], which will come into effect in 2012 after the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol, was unsuccessful in creating a legally binding framework of global emissions reduction. These problems demonstrate how global approaches and agreements between nation states can demonstrate failure.

The territorialisation of carbon governance is a method which has arisen in an attempt to overcome this problem though framing global problems as local and is considered a “[[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] approach” to making change. ‘Think globally, act locally’ is an idea which can be interpreted spatially and conceptually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiener|first=J, B|title=Think globally, act globally: The limits of local climate policies|year=2006|publisher=University Pennsylvania Law Review|pages=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of approaching the problems from a global scale, local governments are asserting themselves as active institutions in the making of climate policy.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; In doing so they are taking responsibility for the accumulation of greenhouse gases within their area. This contradicts the global “commons” theory whereby individuals are unable to take on global issues. The territorialisation of carbon governance uses scale and space in order to establish carbon territories. These can be used to establish and identify connections between carbon  emissions and a geographical area.

== Role of scale and space ==
The concept of territorialisation of carbon governance is a method which reverses how environmental policy regulates global climate from a top down to bottom up approach. This technique tackles issues on a local scale rather than taking a global approach. Territorialisation of carbon governance encompasses ideas of scale and space. Methods by which environmental issues are addressed operate at a number of different levels. These include local, regional, national and international.&lt;ref name="Evans2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans |first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale at which territorialisation of carbon governance operates is local. The idea of ‘space’ can be used to link nature with a state in order to designate ‘carbon territories’.

Territorialisation of nature uses “legible and bounded space” &lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; to define the regulation and administration of state policies related to the environment. With the support of modern technologies for controlling, modeling and measuring atmosphere-biosphere interactions, the ‘invisible’ process of climate change, in recent years, has been “moulded onto territorial ground”.&lt;ref name="stripple2008" /&gt;&gt;

Territoriality can be understood as a form of behavior that “binds, refines and controls space for some social end”.&lt;ref name="Lövbrand2006" /&gt; Within this, 'rule over space' can be defined as a particularly important form of contemporary political authority.&lt;ref name="stripple2008" /&gt; It seeks to govern issues related to climate change. In this regard establishing boundaries can be used to “border” climate change between states. This allows individual states to set specific emission reduction targets and manage carbon sinks alongside their environmental policies.

== Governance beyond the state ==
=== A shift in governance ===
In recent decades a notable shift in government has been observedd. The shift from government to governance is a new concept whereby conventional direct governmental action has been replaced by a more complex system.&lt;ref name="Adshead1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adshead|first=M|author2=Quinn, B |title=The move from government to governance: Irish development policy's paradigm shift|journal=Policy &amp; Politics|year=1998|volume=26|issue=2|pages=209–225|doi=10.1332/030557398782025682}}&lt;/ref&gt; This newer complex system includes policy making and implementation by a new set of actors.&lt;ref name="Adshead1998" /&gt; The shift from government to governance depicts the new range of actors, sites and methods engaged to tackle certain issues.&lt;ref name="Adshead1998" /&gt;

These characteristic shifts in government can be seen in how specific environmental issues are addressed and mitigated also. The former ‘command and control’ model, which dictated regulations and regimented practices could no longer function effectively within the present environmental governance network. The complex nature of the environment, actors and institutions called for a more fluid mode of governing, one which attempts to ‘steer’ and guide.

This new method gave rise to more appropriate and effective conditions for collective action between stakeholders which can work together to achieve common goals and mitigate environmental problems. This has resulted in the duties of government no longer being centralised within the state but being shared with other parts of society such as [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs), cities and regional and local authorities. These range of actors and sites involved in environmental governance demonstrate a growing diversity. A states traditional sovereign  decision-making authority has become shared, in recent years, with such actors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cashore|first=B|title=Legitimacy and the privatization of environmental governance: How non-state market-driven (NSMD) governance systems gain rule-making authority|journal=Governance|year=2002|volume=15|issue=4|pages=503–529|doi=10.1111/1468-0491.00199}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to new methods and strategies. ToCG is an  example of one of these methods in place to address and tackle issues in environmental governance.

Furthermore many environmental issues are considered as problems which go beyond the capacities of individual state institutions.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; This has led to government programs demanding investigations into the relationship between state territories and material natures.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; Territorialisation of carbon can allow the connection of material natures to state territories which can permit an improved governance of carbon.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt;

Sub-national state spaces are examples of bodies which fall below the level of state. These bodies can be effective in tackling climate change and reducing the effects of global warming. Cities are an example of a sub-national space and can demonstrate specific strategies which can help address and mitigate problems in climate change governance. The [[Brundtland Report|1987 Brundtland Report]] drew particular attention to the significance of cities as a means through which issues surrounding sustainable development could be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betsill|first=M, M|author2=Buckeley, H |title=Transnational networks and global environmental governance: The cities for climate protection program|journal=International Studies Quarterly|year=2004|volume=48|issue=2|pages=471–493|doi=10.1111/j.0020-8833.2004.00310.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of cities to organise and initiate specific strategies within carbon governance has been underestimated yet displays enormous potential.

=== Territorialisation and governance ===
Policy making and environmental regulation has shown specific cases of progress and success through the territorialisation of carbon governance.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; This is made possible when direct causes and consequences of global climate change have been connected to a specific geographical space. The United States is an example of a country whereby regions, states and cities have acted beyond the federal government and taken the matter of climate change into their own hands. This illustrates examples of [[multi-level governance]] whereby a shifting in action between local, national and supranational governmental institutions has taken place. This displays an entire new range of actors and institutions which provide order and help govern the environment. Territorialisation of carbon is means by which a city can assert its authority as a coherent space in which to tackle climate change.&lt;ref name="Evans2011" /&gt;

== Territorialisation of carbon governance in Seattle ==
In order to territorialise carbon, geographical areas are created whereby emissions are monitored and environmental policy can set targets of reduction.&lt;ref name="Evans2011" /&gt; Within these geographical areas climatic regulations can be implemented. Seattle is an example of a city where local governments are asserting themselves as active institutions in the development and creation of climate policy. This goes against neoliberal reforms and the favoured market-led environmental regulations which endorse the expansion of the market economy in providing ways to regulate environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=N|title=Spaces of Neoliberalism: Urban Reconstruction in North America and Western Europe|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Malden, MA|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The boundaries of nature and ecosystems are unclear and hard to map. This can be further extended to the characteristics of the atmospheric carbon cycle which is also hard to impose and enforce boundaries on. Understanding and gaining a sense of space and boundary is essential in the territorialisation of carbon. Only then is it possible to govern carbon and the flows of inputs and outputs within a country or state. Although the physical greenhouse gas molecules are part of the shared global atmosphere, sections of them have been assigned to Seattle’s jurisdiction. This is achieved through the territorialisation of carbon whereby the greenhouse gases are spatially referenced to transportation, energy production and consumption and other greenhouse gas activities that occur within the city of Seattle.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt;

Through attributing sections of the carbon cycle to specific carbon emitting activities enables a state to become responsible for the individual flows of carbon within their geographical area. This can allow the governance of carbon and the environment to be better executed in specific locations. The chemical make up of greenhouse gas emissions make them invisible to the human eye and hard to actively measure and observe. The city of Seattle has overcome this problem through creating new strategies which can enable the inclusion of these gases into their jurisdictional territory. Instead of defining these gases as ‘inside’ or ‘outside’ the territory, which would not be feasible, the gases are accounted for by specific places and activities that operate and fall within the geographical space of Seattle.

The territorialisation of carbon governance has empowered actors and institutions&lt;ref name="Evans2011" /&gt; within areas such as Seattle. This provides the city and actors within the city to reassert their ability to regulate infrastructural aspects which are related to carbon governance.

Certain practices, such as transport, pollution and urban development can be better monitored, regulated and managed through the territorialisation of carbon governance. Although there are several greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming, carbon represents the key relation between the state and nature (Rice, 2010). It is through carbon that climate and climate change can be made relevant and connected to practices within a specific geographical area, such as a state. This territorial ‘carbon breakdown’ or territorialisation of carbon governance is what provides states with the political power to address climate issues within their jurisdiction. This is an example of how Seattle has been able use climate as a ‘conceptual resource’ &lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; in order to make urban climate more governable. Through territorialising carbon governance in Seattle many initiatives and regulations have been introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emission levels. The point at which Seattle established itself as its own ‘carbon territory’ an array of strategies have been developed and put into practice. The strategies have been implemented and demonstrate success in reducing the effects of climate change.

In order for this to be made possible the city had to engage and motivate local residents. The [http://www.seattlecan.org/ Seattle Climate Action Now] (SCAN) program has been developed to educate and inspire the local population to become actively involved in reducing carbon emissions. All of these efforts and programs are based on the ability of the city of Seattle to regulate climate through the territorialisation of carbon.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; This new method of [[climate governance]] has achieved an 11 percent reduction in per capita greenhouse gas emissions for 2005 compared to 1999.&lt;ref name="Rice2010" /&gt; This concept has broken down the idea of climate change as being a global problem to more of a local issue that can be tackled and addressed by local communities.

'''''The Ground Beneath Her Feet''''' is [[Salman Rushdie]]'s sixth novel. Published in 1999, it is a variation on the [[Orpheus#Death of Eurydice|Orpheus/Eurydice]] myth with rock music replacing Orpheus' lyre. The myth works as a red thread from which the author sometimes strays, but to which he attaches an endless series of references.

The book, while at its core detailing the love of two men, [[Ormus]] [[Kama|Cama]] and Umeed "Rai" Merchant (the narrator of the story), for the same woman, [[Apsaras|Vina Apsara]], provides a background and alternate history to the entire 1950s–1990s period of the growth of rock music. Defined by [[Toni Morrison]] as "a global novel", the book sets itself in the wide frame of Western and post-colonial culture, through the multilingualism of its characters, the mixture of East and West and the great number of references that span from [[Greek mythology]], [[Western philosophy|European philosophy]] and contemporaries such as [[Milan Kundera]] and the stars of [[rock'n roll]].

The title is taken from a song from the novel, composed by Ormus Cama after Vina's death. The lyrics to the song, with minor changes, were adapted and recorded by [[U2]]. The [[The Ground Beneath Her Feet (song)|song]] was used in the film ''[[The Million Dollar Hotel]]'', and the promotional music video featured Rushdie in a cameo appearance.

* The character of Ormus Cama may be inspired by [[John Lennon]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. While Lennon appears in the book as a separate character, several of Ormus' traits (especially his love of making bread at home) seems to be inspired from him. Ormus' death – immediately outside his apartment building, shot at close range with a small pistol – is also very similar to Lennon's. Also, Lennon's last words are said to be "yes", when a police officer asked him if he knew who he was on the way to the hospital. Ormus' last words were "Yes. Yes, mother, I know", when asked the same question. As a kind of bookend, Ormus has a similar birth to that of Elvis, who had a twin brother born dead, and possibly also of Austrian singer/songwriter [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] who was a sole survivor of triplets and began showing enormous musical talent as a toddler. Rushdie also describes Ormus in physical terms that could describe Elvis, particularly the erotic power of his pelvic gyrations. Rushdie also stated that Ormus Cama was loosely based on [[Freddie Mercury]], who was also a famous [[Parsi people|Parsi]] rock star.
* Rushdie re-introduces characters from his previous novels, including Homi Catrack and William Methwold from ''[[Midnight's Children]]'', S.S. Sisodia from ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', and Aurora Zogoiby from ''[[The Moor's Last Sigh]]'', as well as settings such as Warden Road and Everest Villas.
*The man introducing Umeed to the agency is M. Hulot, a character which seems to be based on Jacques Tati's character from the movie ''[[Les Vacances de M. Hulot]]''.

The novel is set in a parallel universe, as revealed in the second half of the book. Thus, there are several historic events that are altered in the setting of the novel. In the novel, American president [[John F. Kennedy]] survives the Dallas assassination but is shot alongside his brother [[Robert Kennedy]] later on; the [[Watergate scandal]] is represented as a novel starring a fictional president [[Richard Nixon]]. Rushdie also deliberately miscredits some classic rock songs, such as [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]", which he credits to [[John Lennon]], or [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[Oh, Pretty Woman|Pretty Woman]]" which he credits to [[The Kinks]]. The character named ''Jesse Garon Parker'' represents [[Elvis Presley]] in every way, while [[The Who]] are presented under their original name ''The High Numbers''. In his description of the contribution of Vina's voice to the duet, he compares it to that of ''Guinevere Garfunkel'' to [[Carly Simon]]'s [[Bridge over Troubled Waters]], where the names of the singers hint at [[Art Garfunkel]] and [[Paul Simon]].

The novel has been turned into a major performance work combining music and film that premiered at the inaugural [[Manchester]] International Festival in England on 29 June 2007. Composed by [[Victoria Borisova-Ollas]] and featuring a film directed by [[Mike Figgis]] ([[Leaving Las Vegas|''Leaving Las Vegas'']], ''Internal Affairs''), the tale of two star-crossed lovers was performed by the [[Hallé]] orchestra, conducted by its music director [[Mark Elder]] and Alan Rickman as the narrator, with [[Tehmina Sunny]] in the role of Vina.

== Trivia ==

''The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' is also a song by Irish rock band U2 based on Salman Rushdie's lyrics. It was used in the movie ''The Million Dollar Hotel'' and as a bonus track on U2's album, ''All that You Can't Leave Behind''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">In [[particle physics]], the '''threshold energy''' for production of a particle is the minimum [[kinetic energy]] a pair of traveling particles must have when they collide. The threshold energy is always greater than or equal to the rest energy of the desired particle. In most cases, since momentum is also conserved, the threshold energy is significantly greater than the rest energy of the desired particle - and thus there will still be considerable kinetic energy in the final particles.

==Example==
Consider the collision of a mobile proton with a stationary proton so that a &lt;math&gt;{\pi}^0&lt;/math&gt; meson is produced: &lt;math&gt; p^+ + p^+ \to p^+ + p^+ + \pi^0&lt;/math&gt;

Transforming into the ZMF (Zero Momentum Frame or Center of Mass Frame) and assuming the outgoing particles have no KE (kinetic energy) when viewed in the ZMF, the conservation of energy equation is:

&lt;math&gt; E = 2\gamma m_pc^2 = 2 m_pc^2+ m_\pi c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranged to give

&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} = \frac{2 m_pc^2+ m_\pi c^2}{2 m_pc^2} &lt;/math&gt;

By assuming that the outgoing particles have no KE in the ZMF, we have effectively considered an inelastic collision in which the product particles move with a combined momentum equal to that of the incoming proton in the Lab Frame.

Our &lt;math&gt; c^2 &lt;/math&gt; terms in our expression will cancel, leaving us with:

&lt;math&gt; \beta^2 = 1-\left(\frac{2 m_p}{2 m_p+ m_\pi }\right)^2 \approx 0.130 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \beta \approx 0.360 &lt;/math&gt;

Using relativistic velocity additions:

&lt;math&gt; v_\text{lab} = \frac{u_\text{cm} + V_\text{cm}}{1+u_\text{cm}V_\text{cm}/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We know that &lt;math&gt; V_{cm}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the speed of one proton as viewed in the ZMF, so we can re-write with &lt;math&gt; u_{cm} = V_{cm}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; v_\text{lab} = \frac{2 u_\text{cm}}{1+u_\text{cm}^2/c^2} \approx 0.64c&lt;/math&gt;

So the energy of the proton must be &lt;math&gt; E = \gamma m_p c^2 = \frac{m_p c^2}{\sqrt{1-(v_\text{lab}/c) ^2}} = 1221\,&lt;/math&gt; MeV.

Therefore, the minimum kinetic energy for the proton must be &lt;math&gt; T = E -  {m_p c^2} \approx 280&lt;/math&gt; MeV.

== A more general example ==

Consider the case where a particle 1 with lab energy &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; (momentum &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;)
and mass &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; impinges on a
target particle 2 at rest in the lab, i.e. with lab energy and mass &lt;math&gt;E_2 = m_2&lt;/math&gt;.
The threshold energy &lt;math&gt;E_{1,\text{thr}}&lt;/math&gt; to produce three particles of masses &lt;math&gt;m_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_b&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;m_c&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.

&lt;math&gt; 1 + 2 \to a + b + c,&lt;/math&gt;

is then found by assuming that these three particles are at rest in the center of mass frame (symbols with
hat indicate quantities in the center of mass frame):

&lt;math&gt; E_\text{cm} = m_a c^2+ m_b c^2 + m_c c^2 = \hat{E}_1 + \hat{E}_2 = \gamma (E_1 - \beta p_1 c) + \gamma m_2 c^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; E_\text{cm}&lt;/math&gt; is the total energy available in the center of mass frame.

Using &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac{E_1 + m_2 c^2}{E_\text{cm}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac{p_1 c}{E_1 + m_2 c^2} &lt;/math&gt;  and 
&lt;math&gt;p_1^2 c^2 = E_1^2 - m_1^2 c^4 &lt;/math&gt; one derives that 

&lt;math&gt;E_{1,\text{thr}} = \frac{(m_a c^2+ m_b c^2 + m_c c^2)^2 - (m_1 c^2 + m_2 c^2)^2}{2 m_2 c^2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite book

The '''Visean''', '''Viséan''' or '''Visian''' is an [[age (geology)|age]] in the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] [[geologic timescale]] or a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the [[stratigraphic column]]. It is the second stage of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]], the lower [[system (stratigraphy)|subsystem]] of the [[Carboniferous]]. The Visean lasted from {{Period start|Visean}} to {{Period start|Serpukhovian}} [[Megaannum|Ma]].&lt;ref name="GTS 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart|url=http://stratigraphy.org/column.php?id=Chart/Time%20Scale|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows the [[Tournaisian]] age/stage and is followed by the [[Serpukhovian]] age/stage.

==Name and definitions==
The Visean stage was introduced by [[Belgium|Belgian]] geologist [[André Dumont]] in 1832. Dumont named this stage after the city of [[Visé]] in the Belgian [[province of Liège]]. Before being used as an international stage, the Visean stage was part of the (West) European regional geologic time scale, in which it followed the Tournaisian stage and is followed by the [[Namurian]] stage. In the North American regional scale, the Visean stage correlates with the upper [[Osagean]], the [[Meramecian]] and lower [[Chesterian]] stages. In the Chinese regional time scale, it correlates with the lower and middle Tatangian [[series (stratigraphy)|series]].&lt;ref name="menning"&gt;{{aut|Menning, M.; Alekseev, A.S.; Chuvashov, B.I.; Davydov, V.I.; Devuyst, F.-X.; Forke, H.C.; Grunt, T.A.; Hance, L.; Heckel, P.H.; Izokh, N.G.; Jin, Y.-G.; Jones, P.J.; Kotlyar, G.V.; Kozur, H.W.; Nemyrovska, T.I.; Schneider, J.W.;  Wang, X.-D.; Weddige, K.; Weyer, D. &amp; Work, D.M.}}; '''2006''': ''Global time scale and regional stratigraphic reference scales of Central and West Europe, East Europe, Tethys, South China, and North America as used in the Devonian–Carboniferous–Permian Correlation Chart 2003 (DCP 2003)'', Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology '''240'''(1-2): pp 318–372.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The base of the Visean stage is at the first appearance of the [[fusulinid]] species ''Eoparastaffella simplex'' ([[morphotype]] 1/morphotype 2). The type locality for the stage base used to be in a road section below the castle of [[Dinant]] in Belgium, but this [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] proved to be insufficient for the purpose of stratigraphic correlation.&lt;ref name="menning"/&gt; A [[GSSP]] has been proposed in the Luzhai Formation near Penchong in the Chinese province of [[Guanxi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Devuyst, F.X.; Hance, L.; Hou, H.-F.; Wu, X.; Tian, S.; Coen, M. &amp; Sevastopulo, G.}}; '''2003''': ''A proposed Global Stratotype Section and Point for the base of the Visean Stage (Carboniferous): the Pengchong section, Guangxi, South China'', Episodes '''26'''(2), pp 105–115.&lt;/ref&gt; The top (the base of the Serpukhovian and Namurian) is laid at the first appearance of the [[conodont]] ''Lochriea ziegleri'',&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Nemyrovska, T.I.}}; '''2005''': ''Late Visean/early Serpukhovian conodont succession from the Triollo section, Palencia (Cantabrian Mountains, Spain)'', Scr. Geol. '''129''', pp 13–89.&lt;/ref&gt; or at the base of the [[biozone]] of [[goniatite]] ''Cravenoceras leion''.

==Tetrapods==
One of the tetrapods that lived during the Visean age was ''[[Westlothiana]]'', a reptile-like amphibian.

==Biostratigraphy==&lt;!--This is a redirect destination for [[Asbian]] and [[Brigantian]]--&gt;
The Visean contains four conodont biozones:
* ''Lochriea nodosa'' Zone
* ''Lochriea mononodosa'' Zone
* ''[[Gnathodus]] bilineatus'' Zone
* ''Gnathodus texanus'' Zone

In British stratigraphy, the Visean is subdivided into five substages. These are from bottom to top: Chadian (the lower part of this substage falls in the Tournaisian), [[Arundian]], [[Holkerian]], Asbian and Brigantian.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Heckel, P.H. &amp; Clayton, G.}}; '''2006''': ''The Carboniferous system, use of the new official names for the subsystems, series and stages'', Geologica Acta '''4'''(3), pp 403–407.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Australian Mulga shrublands''' is a large dry [[World Wildlife Fund]] [[ecoregion]] of inland [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1310|name=Western Australian Mulga shrublands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and description==
This is a hot, dry area with little rainfall.

The region consists of the [[Gascoyne (biogeographic region)|Gascoyne]], and [[Murchison (biogeographic region)|Murchison]] [[bioregion]]s of the [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] (IBRA).&lt;ref name="IBRA 5.1"&gt;{{cite paper  | author = [[Environment Australia]] | title = Revision of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) and Development of Version 5.1 - Summary Report | publisher = [[Department of the Environment and Water Resources]], [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] | url = http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version5-1/summary-report/index.html | accessdate = 2007-01-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060905215218/http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version5-1/summary-report/index.html |archivedate = 2006-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBRA 6.1"&gt;[http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version6-1/index.html IBRA Version 6.1] data&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The predominant vegetation is [[Acacia aneura|mulga]] trees, a type of [[acacia]] adapted to the hot, dry climate by means of long tap roots. In some areas the mulga trees are surrounded by [[Eriachne]] grassland.

Wildlife of the region includes birds such as [[emu]]s, [[Australian bustard]]s and [[honeyeater]]s.

Most of the area is uninhabited but there is some mining activity and some sheep grazing, both of which cause damage to native habitats.

The '''Western Hemisphere''' is a [[geography|geographical]] term&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of English]] | edition = 2nd | year = 2006 | place = London, UK | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | page = 2001}}&lt;br&gt;- {{citation | contribution = Western /western%20hemisphere | title = Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary | edition = based on Collegiate vol., 11th | year = 2006 | place = Springfield, MA | publisher = Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the half of [[Earth]] which lies [[west]] of the [[prime meridian]] (which crosses [[Greenwich]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]) and [[east]] of the [[180th meridian|antimeridian]]. The other half is called the [[Eastern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|website=Britannica.com|title=Western Hemisphere|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Western-Hemisphere}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Western Hemisphere consists of the [[Americas]], the western portions of [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]], the extreme eastern tip of [[Siberia]] ([[Russia]]), numerous territories in [[Oceania]], and a portion of [[Antarctica]], while excluding some of the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the southwest of the [[Alaska|Alaskan]] mainland.

In an attempt to define the Western Hemisphere as the parts of the world which are not part of the [[Old World]], there also exist projections which use the [[20th meridian west]] and the diametrically opposed [[160th meridian east]] to define the hemisphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation | last = Olson | first = Judy M | contribution = Projecting the hemisphere | url=https://courseware.e-education.psu.edu/projection/ |title=Matching the map projection to the need | editor1-last = Robinson | editor1-first = Arthur H | editor2-last =  Snyder | editor2-first = John P | year = 1997 | place = Bethesda, MD | publisher = Cartography and Geographic Information Society, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping}}.&lt;br&gt;- {{citation | contribution = Western Hemisphere | title =  Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary | edition = 3rd | year = 2001 | place = Springfield, Massachusetts | publisher = Merriam-Webster | page = 1294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This projection excludes the European and African mainlands and a small portion of northeast [[Greenland]], but includes more of eastern Russia and Oceania.

The center of the Western Hemisphere is located in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at the intersection of the [[90th meridian west]] and the [[Equator]], among the [[Galápagos Islands]]. The nearest land is [[Genovesa Island]] at {{coord|0.316667|N|89.95|W|format=dms|display=inline}}.

'''Political cartoons''' produced during '''World War II''' by both Allied and Axis powers commented upon the events, personalities and politics of the war.  Governments used them for [[propaganda]] and [[public information]].{{Dubious|Political cartoon versus propaganda cartoon|date=June 2011}} Individuals expressed their own political  views and preferences.

==History==
During [[World War II]], every major military power had propaganda offices that employed [[political cartoons]] to influence public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Müge Göçek | first = Fatma | title = Political Cartoons in the Middle East: Cultural Representations in the Middle East | publisher = Markus Wiener  Publishers | location = Princeton | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-55876-156-X |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
{{Example farm|section|date=June 2011}}
[[File:Ill Will Geisel Waiting for the Signal from Home 1942.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dr. Seuss]]'s cartoon ''Waiting for the Signal from Home'']]
Before the outbreak of war in Europe, Germany and the Soviet Union formed a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|pact]] to divide the intervening buffer zones between them, and started with the conquest of Poland.  The New Zealand cartoonist, [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], produced a  famous cartoon about this for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' which appeared on 20 September 1939.
