'''Angika''' (अंगिका)  or '''Chhika-Chhiki''' is a language spoken primarily in the [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] states of India and the [[Terai]] region of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt;It belongs to the [[Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indo-Aryan]] language family. It is closely related to languages such as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Magahi language|Magahi]].

Angika is not listed in the [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution|8th schedule of the constitution of India]]. Nevertheless, Angika language movements have advocated its inclusion, and a submitted request is currently pending with the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=5928 | title = Languages in the Eighth Schedule | publisher = Ministry of Home Affairs | date = 2004-12-22 | accessdate = 2011-05-05 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130430162547/http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page.asp?relid=5928 | archivedate = 2013-04-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Angika is written in the [[Devanagari]] script; although the [[Anga Lipi]] and [[Kaithi script|Kaithi]] scripts were used historically.{{cn|date=March 2018}} 
Angika shows a regular contrast for animates.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|p=221}}

== Territory ==

Angika is mainly spoken in eastern Bihar, including [[Munger district|Munger]], [[Bhagalpur district|Bhagalpur]], and [[Purnia district|Purnia]]; and the [[Santhal Pargana division|Santhal Pargana]] area of [[Jharkhand]].{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|p=12}} Its speakers number around 15 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sevanti Ninan |title=Headlines From the Heartland: Reinventing the Hindi Public Sphere |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHRNs4Pt2YAC&amp;pg=PA61 |year=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-0-7619-3580-3 |page=61 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511100606/https://books.google.com/books?id=QHRNs4Pt2YAC&amp;pg=PA61 |archivedate=2018-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to Maithili ==

Angika was classified as a dialect of [[Maithili language|Maithili]] by [[George A. Grierson]] in the ''[[Linguistic Survey of India]]'' (1903).&lt;ref name="uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/lsi/lsi.php?volume=5-2&amp;pages=466#page/110/mode/1up|title=The Record News|website=dsal.uchicago.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903110135/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/lsi/lsi.php?volume=5-2&amp;pages=466#page/110/mode/1up|archivedate=2014-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Angika speakers now assert its status as an independent language. When the proponents of the Maithili language in Bihar demanded use of Maithili-[[medium of instruction|medium]] primary education in the early 20th century, the Angika speaking people did not support them, and instead favoured [[Hindi]]-medium education.{{sfn|Mithilesh Kumar Jha|2017|p=163}} In the 1960s and the 1970s, when the Maithili speakers demanded a separate [[Mithila, India|Mithila]] state, the Angika and Bajjika speakers made counter-demands for recognition of their languages.{{sfn|Kathleen Kuiper|2010|p=57}}

Maithili proponents believe that the [[Government of Bihar]] and the pro-Hindi Bihar Rashtrabhasha Parishad promoted Angika and [[Bajjika]] as distinct languages to weaken the Maithili language movement; many of them still consider Angika to be a dialect of Maithili.{{sfn|Mithilesh Kumar Jha|2017|p=163}} People from mainly [[Maithil Brahmin]]s and [[Karan Kayastha]]s castes have supported the Maithili movement, while people from various other castes in the Mithila region have projected Angika and Bajjika as their mother tongues, attempting to break away from the Maithili-based regional identity.{{sfn|Manish Kumar Thakur|2002|p=208}}

== Official status ==

Angika has the status of "second state language" in the Indian state of [[Jharkhand]] since 2018. It shares this status with 15 other languages, including Maithili.&lt;ref name="telegraph_jharkhand_official"&gt;{{cite news |author=Sudhir Kumar Mishra |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/bhojpuri-3-more-to-get-official-tag-217369 |title=Bhojpuri, 3 more to get official tag |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=22 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322204611/https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/bhojpuri-3-more-to-get-official-tag-217369 |archivedate=22 March 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uniindia.com/~/jharkhand-gives-2nd-language-status-to-magahi-angika-bhojpuri-and-maithali/States/news/1175423.html |title=Jharkhand gives 2nd language status to Magahi, Angika, Bhojpuri and Maithali |publisher=[[United News of India]] |date=21 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324102352/http://www.uniindia.com/~/jharkhand-gives-2nd-language-status-to-magahi-angika-bhojpuri-and-maithali/States/news/1175423.html |archivedate=24 March 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''autograph''' is a person's own signature or handwriting. The term is used particularly in connection with the collecting of autographs of [[celebrity|celebrities]]; the [[hobby]] of collecting autographs is known as "philography".

What might be considered the oldest "autograph" is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] clay table from about 3100 BC which includes the name of the scribe Gar.Ama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=2614|title=The Earliest Autograph Signatures (Circa 3,100 BCE) :  HistoryofInformation.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No ancient written autographs have been found, and the earliest one known for a major historical figure is that of [[El Cid]] from 1098.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-MIChVmZwQC&amp;pg=PA101|title=The Quest for El Cid|first=Richard A.|last=Fletcher|date=1 January 1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Autograph" can refer to a [[document]] transcribed entirely in the handwriting of its [[author]], as opposed to a [[typesetting|typeset]] document or one written by an [[amanuensis]] or a [[allography|copyist]].  This meaning overlaps that of "[[holograph]]".

==Etymology==

The word comes from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αὐτός|αὐτός]]}}, ''autós'', "self" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:γράφω|γράφω]]}}, ''gráphō'', "write".

==Categories of celebrities==

[[File:Isa looking at Autographs.jpg|thumb|Boxing autograph collection]]

Some of the most popular categories of autograph subjects are [[president]]s, [[military]] [[soldier]]s, [[athlete]]s, [[movie star]]s, [[artist]]s, [[social]] and [[religious leader]]s, [[scientist]]s, [[astronaut]]s and [[author]]s.

Some collectors may specialize in specific fields (such as [[Nobel Prize]] winners) or general topics (military leaders participating in [[World War I]]) or specific documents (i.e., signers of the [[Charter of the United Nations]]; signers of the [[U.S. Constitution]]; signers of the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]]; signers of the Charter of the European Common Union; signers of the [[World War II]] German or Japanese surrender documents).

Sports memorabilia signed by a whole team can often be sold for hundreds or thousands of dollars.{{Citation needed|date = April 2015}}

==Commercialization==

Some celebrities still enjoy signing autographs for free for fans, keeping it an interesting hobby.

Many people who stand outside [[premiere]]s, asking for autographs are actually professional autograph traders, who make their living or supplement their income by selling them for full profit, rather than keeping them as a personal [[souvenir]]. This is one of the main reasons why some celebrities will only distribute their signatures for a price. [[Joe DiMaggio]] was able to command more money on signing fees than he made in his playing career, though he also gave individual autographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/11/sports/sports-of-the-times-joe-dimaggio-s-rings-bats-and-tee-shots.html |title=Joe Dimaggio's rings bats and thee shots |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] does not sign at all in public, and only sparingly at private sessions. [[Michael Jordan]] reportedly did not sign for most of his career because of safety concerns about frenzied attempts to get his signature, which is worth hundreds of dollars. Jordan has frequently signed at more peaceful events, such as golf tournaments. [[Pete Rose]] was paid to sign 30 baseballs with the inscription "I'm sorry I bet on baseball."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2592359 |title=GO.com |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=September 19, 2006 |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=A.J. Daulerio |url=http://deadspin.com/5161101/mantle-family-brings-mickeys-f+yogi-ball-home |title=Deadspin |publisher=Deadspin |date=February 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, actor/comedian [[Steve Martin]] carried business cards which he handed out to fans requesting an autograph; the cards read "This certifies that you have had a personal encounter with me and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent and funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chron.com/celebritybuzz/2011/12/steve-martin-abandons-pre-signed-autographs/|title=Steve Martin abandons pre-signed autographs|date=6 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing the potential profit in the sale of pop culture autographs, many dealers also would wait for hours for a celebrity to emerge from a location, present several photos for the celebrity to sign and then sell most of them. [[Michael Jackson]]'s experience was typical; he often signed just a handful of autographs as he rushed from his hotel to his vehicle.  Some collectors take note of which celebrities are the most gracious or the least forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7147980.stm |title=Depp named 'best autograph giver'  |publisher=BBC News |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some dealers would locate a celebrity's home address and write to them repeatedly asking for autographs. The celebrities soon grew tired of the practice and limited their responses. Because of the many autographs a celebrity might sign over time, some check requests against a record of past requests. Boxer [[George Foreman]], for instance, records the names and addresses of every person requesting an autograph to limit such abuses. Some famous people flatly refuse to autograph anything for fans, such as the actors [[Paul Newman]] and [[Greta Garbo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garboforever.com/Garbos_Signatures-1.htm|title=GarboForever - Garbo's Signature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the aviator [[Charles A. Lindbergh]].

==Secretarial signatures==

Celebrities sometimes authorized secretaries to sign their correspondence. In the early months of [[World War II]], U.S. Army Chief of Staff [[George C. Marshall]] felt obligated to sign every condolence letter sent to the families of slain soldiers. But as the death rate increased, he was forced to assign an assistant to "forge" his signature to the letters. The surrogate signatures were hard to distinguish from the originals. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] rarely signed a WWII condolence letter personally and all of his letters to families were signed by one of two assistants who tried hard to duplicate his signature but the forged signatures were distinguished by an unusually high letter "l" and a skinny "D". During the early stage of the Korean War, MacArthur personally signed condolence letters. As the fatalities increased, the General began to use letters with pre-printed signatures.

In the 1952 U.S. presidential election, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] often had secretaries forge his name to campaign letters and "personally inscribed" autographed photographs.

Player signatures on baseballs and footballs that are actually signed by coaches and ballboys are called clubhouse signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://live.autographmagazine.com/forum/topics/how-to-determine-the-difference-between-a-real-and-fake|title=How to Determine the Difference Between a Real and Fake Autograph: Terminology and Photo Examples|last=Gee|first=Cee|date=3 October 2011|website=Autograph Live|publisher=|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autopen autographing==
[[File:Portrait of President Nixon with autopen signature - NARA - 194771.tif|thumb|Portrait of U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] with [[autopen]] signature]]

Since the early 1950s almost all American presidents have had an [[autopen]] or robot machine for the automatic signing of a signature as an autograph machine for their letters, photographs, books, official documents, and even memorabilia items such as [[Baseball (ball)|baseballs]] and [[golf ball]]s. Some former presidents even have continued to utilize the autopen after they have left office. The Signa-Signer can even write out in ink an authentically looking handwritten message that has been typed into the machine. One book detailing the use of this machine by President [[John F. Kennedy]] (1961–63) is ''The Robot That Helped to Make a President'' by Charles Hamilton.

Since the 1960s, the practice of using an autopen has spread to U.S. Cabinet members, U.S. Senators, some [[Governor (United States)|state governors]], and many other personalities who have a high volume of correspondence with the public.

Astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] acknowledged that [[NASA]] used the autopen machine to sign the astronauts' voluminous correspondence. Many large corporations also use these machines for signing business letters. One might think that autopen signatures would constantly match one another. However, even autopen signatures will eventually change as the signature drum becomes worn and thereby alters the signature. Due to these professional imitations, one must be wary of buying presidential or astronaut signatures from unknown sellers.

==Forged autographs==
Autograph collectors enjoy assembling signed historical documents, letters, or objects as a way of capturing a piece of history. However, forgers seek to profit by selling forged items. Sometimes just the signature has been forged, in other instances the entire document has been fabricated. Differentiating forged from authentic autographs is almost impossible for the amateur collector, but a professional may be consulted.

One method commonly seen on [[eBay]] is called "preprinting" by many sellers. The item is only a photocopy of an actual autographed photo, usually printed on glossy home photo paper. Since this is almost always disclosed to the buyer, some may not consider these actual forgeries. In October 2012, Chad Richard Baldwin of Gresham, Oregon, was sentenced to two years in prison for the sale of forged Babe Ruth and Beatles autographs. Mr. Baldwin is a highly skilled forger of sports memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/more-fake-autographs-and-coas-have-oregon-detectives-busy|title=More Fake Autographs and COAs Have Oregon Detectives Busy|date=25 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forgers may go to great lengths to make their forgeries appear authentic. Some use blank end papers from old books upon which to write their fake signatures in an attempt to match the paper of the era in which the personality lived. They have researched ink formulations of the era that they want to replicate. One book that explores the production of impressive fake manuscripts pertaining to [[Latter Day Saints|Mormons]] is ''A Gathering of Saints'' by [[Robert Lindsey (journalist)|Robert Lindsey]].

One must know the era in which American presidents signed their documents. American presidents signed land grants until President [[Andrew Jackson]] (c. 1836) became bored with the time-consuming task. Since then, secretaries of the president have mimicked their masters' signatures on these documents (known as "proxy" signatures). Many [[movie stars]] have their secretaries sign their letters and photographs for them. When [[Ronald Reagan]] was an actor during the 1940s, he had his mother sign his name to much of his [[fan mail]].

During the [[American Civil War]], [[Jefferson Davis]]'s wife frequently signed his name to his dictated letters due to his extensive correspondence. As she duplicated his signature so well, she usually placed a period after the signature so that he could discern her signatures from his own.

All of the Union and Confederate generals from the American Civil War have had their signatures forged. Many were faked during the 1880s, a period that included the fad of aging soldiers in collecting Civil War autographs. Most deceptions were of mere signatures on a small piece of paper, but extensively written letters were forged as well. Autograph collectors should be cautious of ''clipped signatures''. The bogus autograph is glued onto an authentic steel-engraved portrait of the subject. Some steel engravings may have reprinted the autograph of the portrayed subject; this is known as a ''facsimile autograph'', and it may appear to be real.

===Deceptive devices===

Some personalities have used a rubber or steel hand-stamp to "sign" their documents. American President [[Andrew Johnson]] (c.1866) did so during his tenure as a senator prior to assuming the presidency, since his right hand was injured in a train accident. This is why his autograph as president differs from previous autographs. President [[Warren Harding]] frequently used a rubber stamp while he was a senator. Presidents [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] used them, along with President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (c.1916). England's King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and Pennsylvania colony founder [[William Penn]] used a deceiving hand stamp.

[[Joseph Stalin]] had several rubber signature stamps which were used on awards and Communist party cards. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Lavrenti Beria]], the [[KGB]] Chief, used similar stamps.

Quality forgeries have been made for many of Europe's past rulers. The [[French nobility|French nobles]] had their ''secrétaires'' sign their documents. Many forgeries of [[Napoleon]]'s (c.1800) war orders exist; he was so busy with battle concerns that he barely had enough time to sign promotion orders for generals, so his [[scribe]]s applied his name to lesser documents.

Many famous scientists, astronauts, Arctic explorers, musicians, poets, and literary authors have had forgeries of their epistles and signatures produced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} False signatures of [[Charles Lindbergh]] were clandestinely signed onto real 1930-era airmail envelopes bought at stamp shops and then re-sold to unwary buyers; the same has occurred with [[Amelia Earhart]] and the [[Wright brothers]]. "[[Mickey Mouse]]" creator [[Walt Disney]] (1955) had several of his cartoonists duplicate his artistic signature on replies to children seeking his autograph.{{clarify|post-text=What is an "artistic" signature?|date=October 2018}} (Disney's actual autograph was distinctly different from the way it appears in his cartoons.)

Texan paper currency was signed in ink by [[Sam Houston]], though not handwritten by Houston himself.

The October 1986 ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' magazine explored the "[[The Persistence of Memory|melting timepieces]]" artwork of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalí]]. It quoted one of his secretaries as claiming that she signed the artist's signature to postcard depictions of his paintings. Another article in the April 2005 ''Smithsonian'' noted: "In 1965 he began selling signed sheets of otherwise blank lithograph paper for $10 a sheet. He may have signed well over 50,000 in the remaining quarter century of his life, an action that resulted in a flood of Dalí lithograph forgeries."

Some deceivers cut pages from books that American President [[Richard Nixon]] (c.1970) signed on the blank flyleaf, typed his letter of resignation from the presidency on that signed page, and then sold the doctored item as if Nixon had personally signed a scarce copy of the historical document. This practice has expanded to include quotations from [[George W. Bush]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

===Other authenticity issues===

Forgers buy real [[American Revolutionary War]]-era documents and surreptitiously pen a famous patriot's name between other real signatures in a manuscript in hope of deceiving an unsuspecting buyer. Others will use tea or tobacco stains to brown or age their modern missives.

It has been estimated that over 80 percent of the autographed items of famous American sports players being sold over the Internet are fakes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Baseball legend [[Babe Ruth]], for instance, has had his signature forged on old baseballs, then rubbed in dirt to make them appear to be from the 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:183605/datastream/PDF/view|title=Sporting Materiality: Commodification and Fan Agency in Collections, Memorabilia, Jerseys, and Dirt|last=Andon|first=Stephen Patrick|date=May 11, 2011|work=|access-date=September 18, 2016|via=Florida State University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authentication===

With the recent enormous growth of autograph sellers on eBay, and the appearance of a multitude of new galleries and retailers offering expensive autographs, casual autograph collectors and one-time buyers have in many instances sought certificates of authenticity issued by the seller at the time of sale. As with any guarantee, these certificates are only as dependable as the seller issuing them, and if the seller is a fraud, then the certificate, and the possibility that the signed item could be considered worthless. Any certificate or similar issued by a seller should always include the seller's full contact details and any details of Association memberships, and these should always be double checked on the Associations website.

In many instances, sellers will use a professional authenticator to determine the authenticity of the material they wish to bring to market. The autograph industry is currently contentiously split between two types of authenticators: those who rely upon their professional expertise and experience personally having collected and/or sold large inventories of autographs over a period of many years such as the consultants at AutographCOA.com (ACOA), and "forensic examiners" who rely on academic credentials. Disputes have led to court actions, most notably gallery owner American Royal Arts vs. Beatles autograph dealer Frank Caiazzo, often used by autograph sources such as [[RR Auction]].

Potential autograph buyers uncertain of the legitimacy of the seller or authenticator may research both parties, and may check any dealer who claims membership of any association. PADA, the UACC, RACC, and AFTAL include a list of dealers on their websites. This research should not be limited to a seller's or an authenticator's website which could be prejudiced. Some dealers have been known to invent their own association, e.g. "The Universal Manuscript Society", to enhance their reputations.

Mastro Auctions, a major sports autograph auction house which used a professional authenticator, was sued by a dealer in 2006 (Bill Daniels v. Mastro Auctions, Boone County, Indiana, case #06D01-0502 -PL- 0060). Daniels said that he had bought more than 2,000 signed photographs of athletes from Mastro and claimed that the catalog incorrectly described them as all being in color and 8" x 10" in size. Daniels also claimed that some of the autographs on the photographs may have been fakes. He produced two dealers who he said were autograph experts, but Superior Court Judge Matthew C. Kincaid excluded their testimony saying that neither Steve Koschal nor Richard Simon "possess sufficient skill, knowledge or experience in the fields in which they were asked to render opinions." The law for each state is different regarding qualifications to testify. Mr. Simon and Mr. Koschal have both testified in states where their testimony is accepted in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2007/07/15/2007-07-15_lack_of_intent_seen_in_flubs_at_auctions.html |title=Lack of intent seen in flubs at auctions |newspaper=NY Daily News |date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosgrave|Cosgrave]] (Irish Free State).&lt;br /&gt;Seated: [[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]] (United Kingdom), King George V, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (Canada).]]

The '''Balfour Declaration of 1926''', issued by the [[1926 Imperial Conference]] of [[British Empire]] leaders in London, was named after [[Lord President of the Council]] (and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]) [[Arthur Balfour]]. It declared the United Kingdom and the [[Dominion]]s to be:
{{quote|... autonomous Communities within the [[British Empire]], equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to [[the Crown]], and freely associated as members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].}}

The Inter-Imperial Relations Committee, chaired by Balfour, drew up the document preparatory to its unanimous approval by the imperial premiers on 15 November 1926.&lt;ref name="The Balfour Formula"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marshall |first=Sir Peter |date=September 2001 |title=The Balfour Formula and the Evolution of the Commonwealth |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=90 |issue=361 |pages=541–53 |url= |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358530120082823 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 December 2008 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was first proposed by South African Prime Minister [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].
[[File:Gws balfour 01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Arthur Balfour, Earl of Balfour]]
The Declaration accepted the growing political and diplomatic independence of the Dominions in the years after [[World War I]]. It also recommended that the [[Governor-General|governors-general]], the representatives of the King who acted for [[the Crown]] as ''de facto'' head of state in each dominion, should no longer also serve automatically as the representative of the British government in diplomatic relations between the countries. In following years, [[High Commissioner]]s were gradually appointed, whose duties were soon recognised to be virtually identical to those of an ambassador. The first such British High Commissioner was appointed to [[Ottawa]] in 1928.

The conclusions of the imperial premiers conference of 1926 were re-stated by the 1930 conference and incorporated in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of December 1931, by which the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] renounced any legislative authority over dominion affairs, except as specifically provided in law.

{{no footnotes|date=October 2015}}
'''Barbara Ellen Johnson''' (October 4, 1947 – August 27, 2009) was an American [[literary critic]] and translator, born in [[Boston]].  She was a Professor of English and Comparative Literature and the [[Fredric Wertham]] Professor of [[Law]] and [[Psychiatry]] in Society at [[Harvard University]].  Her scholarship incorporated a variety of [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[poststructuralist]] perspectives—including [[deconstruction]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalysis]], and [[feminist theory]]—into a critical, [[interdisciplinary]] study of literature.  As a scholar, teacher, and translator, Johnson helped make the theories of French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] accessible to English-speaking audiences in the United States at a time when they had just begun to gain recognition in France. Accordingly, she is often associated with the "[[Yale school|Yale School]]" of academic literary criticism.

== Early life ==
Barbara Johnson Barbara was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the only daughter of Gilbert and Priscilla (James) Johnson. She graduated from Westwood High School in 1965, attended [[Oberlin College]] from 1965 to 1969, and completed a Ph.D. in French at [[Yale University]] in 1977. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.folsomfuneral.com/?p=776|title=Johnson, Barbara E.|publisher= Folsom Funeral Service|accessdate= 29 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Her graduate studies occurred during the emergence of the "[[Yale school|Yale School]]," a group of [[literary critics]] that included Johnson's thesis director, [[Paul de Man]]. The Yale School's characteristic integration of [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[poststructuralist]] [[theory]] into the study of [[literature]] became an essential feature of Johnson's approach to [[criticism]].

She was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1985 for French Literature. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/barbara-e-johnson/|title=Barbara E. Johnson|publisher= John Simon Guggenheim Foundation|accessdate=29 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of major works ==
In her 1990 essay, "Writing" (in ''Critical Terms for Literary Study''), Johnson outlines the importance of [[theory]] to analyses of [[literature]].  She argues that the [[history]] of writing (''l'écriture'') is an important [[philosophical]], [[political]], and [[psychoanalytical]] concept in twentieth-century French thought. She posits French theorist [[Roland Barthes]]’ appropriation of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]’s concept of the [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]—encompassing both a "[[sign (linguistics)|signifier]]" and a "[[sign (linguistics)|signified]]"—as the foundation of his theory that language is a “structure,” a system of relations governed by a set of rules.  Johnson then goes on to describe the central roles played by [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]] and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]] in destabilizing [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]]' account of the relation between signifier and signified and the “structure” of [[language]]. Following Derrida, Johnson argues that reading is not the task of grasping the true single meaning of a [[textuality|text]], but of grasping its multiple meanings, which are often unstable and contradictory.  This [[polysemy]] has allowed [[feminist]] and marginalized readers to enter texts at the locations where the author tries to "dominate, erase, or distort" the various "other" claims that are made through language and reassert their identities.

=== ''The Critical Difference'' ===
In ''The Critical Difference'' (1980), Johnson argues that any model of difference as a polarized difference “between entities ([[prose]] and [[poetry]], man and woman, [[literature]] and [[theory]], guilt and innocence)” is  necessarily founded upon “a repression of differences within entities” (pp. x-xi). In this book, Johnson explores how the unknown and the unknowable function in a text. The “unknown” to which she refers is not something concealed or distant, but a fundamental unknowability that constitutes and underlies our linguistic cognition.

In one of the articles in ''The Critical Difference'', “Melville’s Fist: The Execution of [[Billy Budd]],” Johnson reads [[Herman Melville]]’s novel as a performance of the irreconcilability between the  “[[sign (linguistics)|signifier]]” and the “[[sign (linguistics)|signified]].” She argues that if a description could perfectly describe its [[referent]] and actually “hit” its intended object (just as Billy Budd hits and kills [[John Claggart]]), the result would be the annihilation of that object. Language, thus, can only function upon imperfection, instability, and unknowability.

=== ''A World of Difference'' and ''The Feminist Difference'' ===
Johnson’s next book, ''A World of Difference'' (1987), reflects a move away from the strictly [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical context of her analyses in ''The Critical Difference''. Johnson wants to take her investigation beyond “the white male Euro-American literary, philosophical, psychoanalytical, and critical canon” that dominates the [[academy]] as a whole and her work in particular (p.&amp;nbsp;2). But she also calls the “sameness” of that white Euro-American literary and critical tradition into question, undertaking a thorough interrogation of its boundaries. In addition, Johnson expands the scope of her literary subjects to include black and/or women writers, such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Dorothy Dinnerstein]], [[James Weldon Johnson]], and [[Adrienne Rich]].  Her subsequent collection, ''The Feminist Difference'' (1998), offers a continued critique of the terms in play throughout [[feminism]]’s history and an examination of the differences within and between feminisms.

=== ''The Wake of Deconstruction'' ===
''The Wake of Deconstruction'' (1994) approaches the general state of [[deconstruction]] in light of the backlash it faced over the course of the 1980s and early '90s. Through the double lenses of [[Paul de Man]]’s posthumous [[Nazi]] [[collaboration]] scandal and the academic community’s reaction to the murder of [[feminist]] legal [[theorist]] [[Mary Joe Frug]], Johnson discusses [[allegory]], [[feminism]], and the misinterpretation of [[deconstruction]].

== The Problematics of language ==

=== The question of translation ===
In "Taking Fidelity Philosophically" (in ''Difference in Translation''), Johnson describes [[translation]] as an ultimately impossible endeavor because the "mother" or original language is already, intrinsically untranslatable from signifier to signified. The more one attempts to translate a work into comprehensibility, the more likely one is to stray from its original ambiguity.  [[Jacques Derrida]], with his thoughts on [[différance]], elucidates the complicating but necessary fact of language: that it is foreign to itself. Every attempt to translate sets the language against itself, creating new tensions as it progresses. [[Translation]], though impossible, is also necessary, as it is precisely these tensions that constitute language.

=== Deconstruction, indeterminacy, and politics ===
Throughout her work, Johnson emphasizes both the difficulty of applying [[deconstruction]] to political action and of separating linguistic contradictions, complexities, and [[polysemy]] from political questions. In ''A World of Difference'', she makes a turn to a “real world,” but one which is always left in quotation marks—"real," but nonetheless inseparable from its textual, written aspect. In a chapter of the book entitled, “Is Writerliness Conservative?” Johnson examines the political implications of [[undecidablility]] in writing, as well as the consequences of labeling the [[poetic]] and the undecidable as [[politically]] inert. She writes that, if “poetry makes nothing happen,” poetry also “makes ''nothing'' happen”—the limits of the political are themselves fraught with political implications (p.&amp;nbsp;30). [[Harold Schweizer]] writes in his introduction to ''The Wake of Deconstruction'' that “[i]f interpretive closure always violates textual indeterminacy, if authority is perhaps fundamentally non-textual, reducing to identity what should remain different, Johnson’s work could best be summarized as an attempt to delay the inevitable reductionist desire for meaning” (p.&amp;nbsp;8).

=== Prosopopoeia and anthropomorphism ===
In "Apostrophe, Animation, and Abortion" (in ''The Critical Difference'') and "Anthropomorphism in Lyric and Law" (in ''Persons and Things''), Johnson discusses the recurrence of rhetorical figures of [[prosopopoeia]] (an address to a dead or absent person) and [[anthropomorphism]] (conferring human attributes on a nonhuman entity) within contemporary disputes about [[abortion]], [[corporate personhood]], and other debates surrounding who or what qualifies as a person. "Apostrophe" juxtaposes Romantic poets such as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] with twentieth-century poems by [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], [[Lucille Clifton]], and [[Adrienne Rich]] that deal with women's experiences following abortion. Johnson argues that the analogy between creative writing and giving [[birth]], traditionally employed by male poets like [[Philip Sidney|Sidney]] and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]], re-appears in a distorted fashion in women's writing. Johnson's concern with prosopopoeia represents an ongoing elaboration of [[Paul de Man]]'s work, extending the problems posed in his essays "Autobiography as De-Facement" and "Anthropomorphism and Trope in Lyric" (in ''The Rhetoric of Romanticism'') to [[feminist literary theory|feminist]] and [[African-American literature|African-American]] literature.

A '''Case Information Statement''' (or '''Cover Sheet''') is a document which is filed with a [[court clerk]] at the commencement of a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[lawsuit]] in many of the [[State court (United States)|court systems]] of the [[United States]].  It is generally filed along with the [[complaint]].  Some [[U.S. state|states]] use similar documents for [[Criminal law|criminal]] cases as well. 

==Purpose and terminology==

The purpose of a Case Information Statement is to let the [[judge]] and court clerk know what type of case is being brought by the parties, so that they can better prepare for the case to come to [[Trial (law)|trial]].  Some courts (for example, the [[New Jersey Superior Court]]) put different types of cases on different "tracks", to place limits on how long [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] they should take.

If the [[lawyer]] filling out the Case Information Statement makes a mistake, or if circumstances change or new information is discovered, the [[Party (law)|party]] wishing to amend the statement may do so by making a [[Motion (legal)|motion]] to the judge in charge of the case.

Some courts use the term Cover Sheet for this document, but the content and purpose is the same.  For example, the equivalent document in [[United States district courts|federal district courts]] is Form JS-44, Civil Cover Sheet.  Similarly, the [[Superior Courts of California]] have a Form CM-010, Civil Case Cover Sheet.

==Case Information Statements in civil cases==
Questions typically asked on Civil Case Information Statements include:
*The underlying subject matter of the lawsuit
*[[Amount in controversy]] or [[Legal remedy|remedies]] demanded
*Whether a [[jury trial]] is requested by either party
*Whether there are additional parties to be [[Joinder|joined]]
*Whether the lawsuit is a potential [[class action]] or some other type of complex case
*Whether there are similar actions pending in other courts
*What, if any, previous relationship exists between/among the parties (e.g. [[employment]], [[Family|familial]], [[business]] associates, etc.)
*Whether [[attorney fees]] are in contention (in some types of cases, attorney fees must be paid by the losing party)

In [[family law]] cases (such as [[divorce]] and [[child custody]] matters), the questions asked on the Case Information Statement are often longer and more detailed, requiring recitation of each party's employment situation, current [[income]], and the [[asset]]s and [[Legal liability|liabilities]] of each party.

==Case Information Statements in criminal cases==
Questions typically asked on Criminal Case Information Statements include:
*The attorneys involved in the case
*The basic facts and circumstances involved
*Whether the [[defendant]] is currently in custody or out on [[bail]]
*Whether there are co-defendants
*Whether all issues will be disposed of by this case
*Whether the [[constitutionality]] of any [[statute]], [[regulation]], or [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] is being challenged

==New York's Request for Judicial Intervention==
{{POV-section|date=November 2012}}
New York's equivalent document is the Request for Judicial Intervention, which is necessary because in New York a case begins with the ''service'' of a complaint and ''nothing'' is filed with the trial court until absolutely necessary (usually because a discovery dispute develops, someone wants to file a dispositive motion, or it is actually time for trial).  At that time, the party seeking judicial intervention files a RJI (which asks for information similar to a CIS or cover sheet) and files with the court all relevant documents from the party's own version of the case file.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7484">In law, '''comity''' is "a practice among different political entities (as countries, states, or [[court]]s of different [[jurisdiction]]s)" involving the "[[reciprocity (international relations)|mutual recognition]] of  [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[Judiciary|judicial]] acts."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' (10th ed. 2014), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Comity derives from the Latin ''comitas'', courtesy, from ''cemis'', friendly, courteous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Comity|volume=6|page=765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
{{see also|Enforcement of foreign judgments}}
The '''doctrine of international comity''' has been described variously "as a choice-of-law principle, a synonym for [[private international law]], a rule of [[public international law]], a [[moral obligation]], expediency, [[courtesy]], reciprocity, utility, or diplomacy. Authorities disagree as to whether comity is a rule of [[natural law]], [[Customary international law|custom]], [[treaty]], or domestic law. Indeed, there is not even agreement that comity is a rule of law at all."&lt;ref&gt;Joel R. Paul, ''Transformation of International Comity'', 71 ''[[Law &amp; Contemporary Problems]]'' 19, 19–20 (2008) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the doctrine touches on many different principles, it is regarded as "one of the more confusing doctrines evoked in cases touching upon the interests of foreign states."&lt;ref&gt;''International Human Rights Litigation in U.S. Courts:'', 2d rev. ed. ([[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|Martinus Nijhoff]], 2008: eds. Beth Stephens et al.), p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of international comity was created by a group of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] jurists in the late seventeenth century, most prominently [[Ulrich Huber]].&lt;ref name="paul22"&gt;Paul, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hessel E. Yntema, ''The Comity Doctrine'', 65 ''[[Michigan Law Review]]'' 9, 9 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; Huber and others sought a way to handle [[conflicts of law]] in a way that would reinforce the idea of [[Westphalian sovereignty]].&lt;ref name="paul22"/&gt; Huber wrote that '''''comitas gentium''''' ("civility of nations") required the application of foreign law in certain cases because sovereigns "so act by way of comity that rights acquired within the limits of a government retain their force everywhere so far as they do not cause prejudice to the powers or rights of such government or of their subjects."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, p. 23 (quoting Ernest G. Lorenzen, Huber's De Conflictu Legum, 13 ''Illinois Law Review'' 375, 376 (1919)).&lt;/ref&gt; Huber  "believed that comity was a principle of international law" but also that "the decision to apply foreign law itself was left up to the state as an act of [[free will]]."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of comity was introduced into [[English law]] by [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], a Scottish barrister and jurist.&lt;ref name="paul23"&gt;Paul, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield viewed the application of comity as discretionary, with courts applying foreign law "except to the extent that it conflicted with principles of natural justice or [[public policy]]."&lt;ref&gt;Paul, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield held in ''[[Somerset v Stewart]]'' ([[Court of King's Bench|King's Bench]] 1772), for example, that [[slavery]] was so morally odious that a British court would not recognize the property rights of an [[Slavery in the United States|American slaveholder]] in his slave.&lt;ref name="paul23"/&gt;

In the United States, Louisiana attorney [[Samuel Livermore (legal writer)|Samuel Livermore]] (who wrote the first American treatise of conflict of laws in 1828) expressly rejected the comity doctrine as formulated by Mansfield and earlier writers, instead arguing that "courts were bound by international law to apply the same law that a foreign court would apply."&lt;ref name="paul24"&gt;Paul, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was rejected by Justice [[Joseph Story]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], who agreed with Mansfield and Huber in his ''Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws''. Story's view, which ultimately prevailed, was that the consensual or voluntary application of comity doctrine would foster trust among states, "localize the effect of slavery," and reduce the risk of [[American Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref name="paul24"/&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court's holding in ''[[Hilton v. Guyot]]'' (1895) that the enforcement of a foreign [[judgment (law)|judgment]] was a matter of comity is viewed as the "classic" statement of comity in international law.&lt;ref&gt;Paul, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Human Rights Litigation in U.S. Courts:'', 2d rev. ed., p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held in that case:

{{quote|"Comity," in the legal sense, is neither a matter of absolute obligation, on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy and good will, upon the other. But it is the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Hilton v. Guyot'', 159 U.S. 113, 163–64 (1895)).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, certain foreign [[defamation]] judgments are not recognized under the [[SPEECH Act]] (a federal statute enacted in 2010), which supersedes the comity doctrine. The Act aims to stop "[[libel tourism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dana Green, [http://apps.americanbar.org/litigation/litigationnews//mobile/firstamendment-SPEECH.html The SPEECH Act Provides Protection Against Foreign Libel Judgments], ''Litigation News'' ([[American Bar Association]] Section of Litigation).&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Constitution==
In the [[law of the United States]], the ''Comity Clause'' is another term for the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of the [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article Four]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which provides that "The [[United States citizen|Citizens]] of each [[U.S. state|State]] shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several [[U.S. state|States]]."&lt;ref&gt;John E. Nowak &amp; Ronald D. Rotunda ''Principles of Constitutional Law'' (Thomson/West, 2007), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Article Four as a whole&amp;mdash;which includes the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the [[Extradition Clause]], and the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]]&amp;mdash;has been described as the "interstate comity" article of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Reynolds &amp; William M. Richman, ''The Full Faith and Credit Clause: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'' ([[Praeger Publishing|Praeger]], 2005), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional licensure==
In the United States, some states and territories recognize [[professional engineer]] licenses granted in a different jurisdiction, depending on the holder's education and experience (a practice called "licensure by comity"). Rules differ significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nspe.org/resources/licensure/resources/licensure-comity Licensure by Comity], [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] (accessed March 29, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4641">'''Controlled natural languages''' ('''CNLs''') are subsets of [[natural language]]s that are obtained by restricting the grammar and vocabulary in order to reduce or eliminate [[ambiguity]] and complexity. Traditionally, controlled languages fall into two major types: those that improve readability for human readers (e.g. non-native speakers),
and those that enable reliable automatic semantic analysis of the language.

The first type of languages (often called "simplified" or "technical" languages), for example ASD Simplified Technical English, Caterpillar Technical English, IBM's Easy English, are used in the industry to increase the quality of technical documentation, and possibly simplify the (semi-)automatic translation of the documentation.
These languages restrict the writer by general rules such as "Keep sentences short", "Avoid the use of pronouns", "Only use dictionary-approved words", and "Use only the active voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.mt-archive.info/CLT-2003-Obrien.pdf |title=Controlling Controlled English - An Analysis of Several Controlled Language Rule Sets | first = Sharon | last = O'Brien |year=2003 |booktitle=Proceedings of EAMT-CLAW }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of languages have a formal logical basis, i.e. they have a formal syntax and semantics, and can be mapped to an existing [[formal language]], such as [[first-order logic]]. Thus, those languages can be used as [[knowledge representation language]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Schwitter, Rolf. "[http://staff.um.edu.mt/mros1/cnl2010/TALKS/schwitter_tutorial.pdf Controlled natural languages for knowledge representation]." Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Posters. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and writing of those languages is supported by fully automatic consistency and redundancy checks, [[query answering]], etc.

'''César Nicolás Penson''' (23 January 1855 – 29 October 1901) was an author, poet, and lawyer from the [[Dominican Republic]]. &lt;!-- Su obra ''Cosas añejas'' (1891) es considerada una de las obras representativas de la literatura dominicana del siglo XIX.&lt;ref&gt;Tejada, Rita. [http://www.cielonaranja.com/ritatejadapenson.htm «El texto y su época: estudio sociográfico de Cosas Añejas.»] Consultado el 5 de febrero de 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

== Biography ==
The son of Juana Tejera and William Nicholas Penson (an [[Englishman]]), he attended an [[elementary school]] where he learned to read and write. Later, he attended the Colegio San Luis Gonzaga in his hometown, where he perfected his studies in languages, music and mathematics from an early age standing out in literature.
&lt;!-- Trabajó en la administración pública como escribiente en el Tribunal de Primera Instancia de la provincia de Santo Domingo y, desde ese momento, soñó con ser abogado. En 1875 Penson vivía en Puerto Plata donde comenzó su carrera como periodista, colaborando en ''El Porvenir'' y ''El Ciudadano''.

En esa misma ciudad fundó el periódico ''La Idea'' y fue censurado por un artículo que escribió. Allí fundó el periódico ''El Telegrama'', primer diario del país por el que se le considera el padre del periodismo dominicano. Además, también fueron fundados por él ''El Diario del Ozama'' y ''La Lucha Activa'', y fue colaborador de la revista ''Letras y Ciencias'' y de los periódicos el ''Listín Diario'' y ''El Teléfono''.

Fue profesor del Instituto para Señoritas de [[Salomé Ureña de Henríquez]]. En la literatura dominicana se distinguió como escritor y poeta, incursionó en la crítica literaria, y fue un excelente traductor.
Se graduó de abogado el dos de noviembre de 1892 y pasó a ser oficial del Ministerio Público de Justicia e Instrucción y secretario controlador de la Junta Directa de Estudios. Aňos más tarde fue nombrado presidente del Tribunal de Primera Instancia del distrito de Santo Domingo.

Contrajo matrimonio el 29 de abril de 1880 con Francisca Antonia Rodríguez Montaño, con quien tuvo dieciocho hijos, y murió en la ciudad donde había nacido 46 años antes, el 30 de octubre de 1901. --&gt;

The '''Dangme language''', also ''Dangme'' or ''Adaŋgbi'', is a [[Kwa languages|Kwa language]] spoken in south-eastern [[Ghana]] by the Dangme People ''(Dangmeli)''. The Dangmeli are part of the larger [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga-Dangme]] ethnic group. Klogbi is a variant, spoken by the [[Krobo people|Kloli (Klo or Krobo People)]] 

==Classification==
Dangme is a [[Kwa languages|Kwa language]], part of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo family]]. It is very closely related to [[Ga language|Ga]], and together they form the [[Ga–Dangme languages|Ga–Dangme]] branch within Kwa. It is also part of the [[Gbe language]] group,

==Geographic distribution==
Dangme is spoken in [[Ghana]] by over 800,000 people in 2004.

It is the aboriginal language spoken in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]] by the people of Ada, Osudoku, Manya Krobo, Yilo Krobo, Shai, Ningo, Prampram and Kpone. The Dangme and Ga people can readily understand each other without intentional study or special effort because both languages are mutually intelligible. Dangme as a school subject is taught in the Dangme areas.
 
The land of these related tribes stretched from the Greater Accra Region to the Easter Region of Ghana, northward to the [[Akwapim]] hills and has all the Dangmeland on the east and the [[Ga people|Ga]] to the west of it. Bawaleshi, which is about 4.8 kilometers southwest of Dodowa, is the last Dangme town which is close to the [[Akwapim]] and the Ga boundaries.
There are six main dialects which coincide with political unit. The coastal dialects are Ada, Ningo and Prampram (Gbugbla). The inland dialects are Shai (Sɛ), Krobo (Klo) and Osudoku.

'''Death and taxes''' is a common reference to the famous quotation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Writings of Benjamin Franklin, Vol. X (1789-1790)|last = Smyth|first = Albert Henry|publisher = Macmillan|year = 1907|isbn = |location = New York|page = 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except '''death and taxes'''.|[[Benjamin Franklin]]|in a letter to Jean-Baptiste Leroy, 1789}}

However, Franklin’s letter is not the origin of the phrase, which appeared earlier in Daniel Defoe’s ''The Political History of the Devil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Political History of the Devil,  As Well Ancient as Modern: In Two Parts|last = DeFoe|first = Daniel|publisher = Black Boy in Pater-noster Row|year = 1726|isbn = |location = London|page = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Things as certain as '''death and taxes''', can be more firmly believ’d.|[[Daniel Defoe]], ''[[The Political History of the Devil]]'', 1726.}} 
And in ''The Cobbler of Preston'' by Christopher Bullock (1716)  {{quote|’Tis impossible to be sure of any thing but '''Death and Taxes''',}}

'''Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka''' ({{lang-en|Institute of Language and Literature}}, [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: ديوان بهاس دان ڤوستاک), abbreviated '''DBP''', is the government body responsible for coordinating the use of the [[Malay language]] and [[Malaysian literature|Malay-language literature]] in [[Malaysia]].

==History==

DBP Malaysia was established as '''Balai Pustaka''' in [[Johor Bahru]] on 22 June 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Shuhaini Aznam. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012205617/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/6/25/focus/14643894&amp;sec=focus Guardian of the Malay Language]''. [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]. 25 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was placed under the purview of the then Malayan Ministry of Education.

During the ''Kongres Bahasa dan Persuratan Melayu III'' (The Third Malay Literary and Language Congress) which was held between 16 and 21 September 1956 in both Singapore and Johor Bahru, Balai Pustaka was renamed Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. Royal Prof [[Ungku Abdul Aziz Ungku Abdul Hamid]] was instrumental in setting up the institution.

In 1957, DBP moved from [[Johor Bahru]] to [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Through ''Ordinan Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka 1959'', DBP was granted a charter with its own Board of Governors. With the charter, DBP has the power to form policies regarding the Malay language, responsible to spread the language and is able to go into book publishing business.

On 31 January 1962, DBP moved to its own building at Jalan Lapangan Terbang Lama (now Jalan Dewan Bahasa). The building's architect was [[Lee Yoon Thim]] and the prominent mural was by [[Ismail Mustam]]. Later in 1977, it opened offices in [[Kota Kinabalu]] and [[Kuching]], taking over the role of Borneo Literature Bureau in Sarawak. Soon after that, DBP had all the books in [[Iban language]] and other Bornean languages buried. However, some books were found and rescued. It was later alleged that all the books were burnt. Initially, DBP officials insisted on publishing works in national language ([[Malay language]]) or other vernaculars. However, soon after that DBP stated that they cannot publish books in regional languages because this would be against its own policy and is not economically sound in a small market of readers.&lt;ref&gt;Postill John. (2006). In ''[https://books.google.com.my/books?id=-5_gtJQFin4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=books+in+Iban+and+other+Bornean+languages+buried.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mxfSVNbkItLhuQTmwIG4Dg&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=books%20in%20Iban%20and%20other%20Bornean%20languages%20buried.&amp;f=false Media and Nation Building: How the Iban became Malaysian]''. [[Berghahn Books]]. p. 59-60. Google Book Search. Retrieved 4 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three other offices were established in [[Bukit Mertajam]] (1999), [[Kota Bharu]] (1999) and Johor Bahru (2003). The institution celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2006.

DBP also produces many talented novelists. Most outstanding DBP novel writers are Miss Siti Habsah Abdullah, Mrs. Malardevi Margamuthu, and Mr.Syed Satahkatulah Bin Mohamed Kalik.

==Dictionary and other publications==
DBP publishes the '''[[Kamus Dewan]]''', for many years the prestigious dictionary of the Malaysian national language. The dictionary is not only descriptive, but rather it is also prescriptive, as it represents the results of the efforts of DBP to adapt the [[Malay language]] to accommodate the challenges of technology and science. DBP's role in developing and regulating the language may be likened to that of similar government bodies in other countries, for example the [[Académie Française]].

It also processes many books, mainly [[workbook|work books]] and [[novel]]s.

==History==
The project was started at the end of 2009 in [[Pittsburgh]] by [[Carnegie Mellon University]] professor [[Luis von Ahn]] (creator of [[reCAPTCHA]]) and his graduate student [[Severin Hacker]], and then developed along with Antonio Navas, Vicki Cheung, Marcel Uekermann, Brendan Meeder, Hector Villafuerte, and Jose Fuentes.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/12/duolingo/ |publisher=TechCrunch|title=Meet Duolingo, Google's Next Acquisition Target; Learn A Language, Help The Web | first =MG | last = Siegler |date=April 12, 2011|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duolingo Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitpic.com/4sjlpm | publisher= Twitpic|title=The Duolingo Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspiration for Duolingo came from two places. Luis Von Ahn wanted to create another program that served two purposes in one, what he calls a "twofer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Learning with Big Data: The Future of Education|last1 = Mayer-Schönberger|first1 = Viktor|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-54435550-7|location = |pages = 9–10|url = https://books.google.com/?id=OXzeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |last2 = Cukier |first2 = Kenneth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duolingo originally did this by teaching its users a foreign language while having them translate simple phrases in documents, though the translation feature has since been removed.&lt;ref name="Immersion removed"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://support.duolingo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000425806-What-happened-to-Immersion- | publisher=duolingo | title=What Happened to Immersion?}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Ahn was born in [[Guatemala]] and saw how expensive it was for people in his community to learn English. Severin Hacker (born in Zug, Switzerland), co-founder of Duolingo, and Von Ahn believe that "free education will really change the world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/01/22/crowdsourcing-capitalists-how-duolingos-founders-offered-free-education-to-millions/ |title= Crowdsourcing Capitalists: How Duolingo's Founders Offered Free Education To Millions| first =Parmy | last = Olson|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted to supply the people an outlet to do so.

The project was originally sponsored by Luis von Ahn's [[MacArthur fellowship]] and a [[National Science Foundation]] grant.&lt;ref name="NSFGrant"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1054630 |publisher=National Science Foundation|title= Online Education as a Vehicle for Human Computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewScientist"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328476.200-learn-a-language-translate-the-web.html |publisher=New Scientist|title=Learn a language, translate the web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding was later received in the form of investments from [[Union Square Ventures]] and actor [[Ashton Kutcher]]'s firm, [[A-Grade Investments]].&lt;ref name="pittsgazzette"&gt;{{cite news|last= Todd |first= Deborah M.|title= Ashton Kutcher backs CMU duo's startup Duolingo |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/ashton-kutcher-backs-cmu-duos-startup-duolingo-641086/ |accessdate=July 13, 2012|newspaper= Pittsburgh Post Gazette|date=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |title= The Daily Start-Up: Kutcher-Backed Language Site Duolingo Finds Its Voice |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2012/06/19/the-daily-start-up-kutcher-backed-language-site-duolingo-finds-its-voice/ |accessdate=July 13, 2012|newspaper= The Wall Street Journal |date=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duolingo started its [[private beta]] on November 30, 2011, and accumulated a waiting list of more than 300,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/16/2639262/duolingo-translate-internet-teach-languages|title=Duolingo will translate the internet while teaching languages|author=Adi Robertson|publisher=''[[The Verge]]''|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2012, Duolingo launched for the general public. Due to popular interest, Duolingo has received many investments including a $20 million Series C round of investment led by Kleiner Caufield &amp; Byers and a $45 million Series D round of investment led by Google Capital.&lt;ref name="DuoBlog"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.duolingo.com/post/20142464554/we-have-a-blog |publisher= Duolingo | work = Blog |title= We have a blog!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duolingo has 95 staff members, of whom many were Google employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Google effect: How has the tech giant changed Pittsburgh's commerce and culture? |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2014/12/07/Google-effect-How-has-tech-giant-changed-Pittsburgh-s-commerce-and-culture/stories/201412040291| work = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=January 11, 2015|date=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operates from an office in the Pittsburgh neighborhood of East Liberty.&lt;ref name="duolingo.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/blog/innovation/2013/05/duolingo-launching-on-android-signing.html |title= Duolingo launching on Android; plans move to bigger office |publisher= Biz journals|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2016/03/23/duolingo-moving-to-east-liberty-plans-to-add.html|title=Duolingo moving to East Liberty, plans to add employees|date=March 23, 2016|last=Hartmans|first=Avery|website=Pittsburgh Business Times|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 2012, Duolingo released their [[iOS]] app through the [[iTunes App Store]].&lt;ref name=TCiOS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/language-learning-service-duolingo-launches-its-first-iphone-app/|title=Language Learning Service Duolingo Launches Its First iPhone App|author=Frederic Lardinois|work=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 13, 2012|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application is a free download and is compatible with most [[iPhone]], [[iPod]] and [[iPad]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duolingo – Learn Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Italian for free|url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french/id570060128 |work= iTunes App Store|publisher=Apple|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, 2013, Duolingo released their [[Android app]], which was downloaded about a million times in the first three weeks and quickly became the #1 education app in the Google Play store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farber |first=Dan |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57593078-93/duolingo-brings-free-language-courses-to-the-ipad/ |title= Duolingo brings free language courses to the iPad |publisher= C net |date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the company had a total funding of USD $108.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/duolingo-raises-25m-at-a-700m-valuation/|title=Duolingo raises $25M at a $700M valuation|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|date=July 25, 2017|website=TechCrunch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duolingo received a fifth-round $25 million in July 2017 from Drive Capital, with the funds directed toward creating initiatives such as TinyCards and Duolingo Labs.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elaine|first1=Ramirez|title=Duolingo Is Launching A Korean Course To Cash In On Asia's Booming Language Market|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineramirez/2017/09/07/duolingo-korean-language-course-launch/4/#2ecaa1d8739f|website=Forbes|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Duolingo has a freemium business model and it uses advertising in both its Android and iPhone apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Crowdsourcing Capitalists: How Duolingo's Founders Offered Free Education To Millions|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/01/22/crowdsourcing-capitalists-how-duolingos-founders-offered-free-education-to-millions/|website = Forbes|accessdate =December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duolingo courses include periodic advertisements which users can remove by paying a subscription fee. To earn money, Duolingo originally employed a [[crowdsourcing|crowd sourced]] business model, where the content came from organizations (such as [[CNN]] and [[BuzzFeed]]) that paid Duolingo to translate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simonite |first=Tom |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/506656/the-cleverest-business-model-in-online-education/ |title= The Cleverest Business Model in Online Education |publisher= Technology review |date=November 29, 2012|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, Duolingo runs ads on both its mobile and desktop applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.duolingo.com/comment/15479130|title=Duolingo: Learn Spanish, French and other languages for free|website=www.duolingo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game elements ==
Duolingo mimics the structure of video games in several ways in order to engage its users. There is a reward system in which users acquire "lingots", an in-game currency that can be spent on features such as character customizations or bonus levels. There are public leaderboards in which people can compete against their friends or see how they stack up against the rest of the world. The level system that Duolingo uses is XP ([[experience points]]), a numerical system that represents a user's skill level. Badges in Duolingo represent achievements that are earned from completing specific objectives or challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huynh|first=Duy|last2=Zuo|first2=Long|last3=Iida|first3=Hiroyuki|date=2016-12-05|title=Analyzing Gamification of "Duolingo" with Focus on Its Course Structure|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-50182-6_24|journal=Games and Learning Alliance|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Cham|pages=268–277|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-50182-6_24|isbn=9783319501819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== School use ==
{{Advert section|date=May 2018}}
Duolingo provides "Duolingo for Schools" with features designed to allow teachers to track their students.  In 2012, an effectiveness study of Duolingo was published with the authors concluding that Duolingo usage for Spanish study was more effective than classroom language learning alone, but that this effect was less for more advanced learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf|title=Duolingo Effectiveness Study|last=VESSELINOV|first=ROUMEN|date=December 2012|website=Duolingo.com|access-date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed reason for this is that the direct-translation method that Duolingo primarily uses is more applicable to simpler words and phrases than to complex ones; simpler ones can be translated in a more exact manner from one language to another and thus are more conducive to Duolingo's direct-translation method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Heba|date=2016-06-15|title=Duolingo as a Bilingual Learning App: a Case Study|url=http://awej.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=930:heba-bahjet-essa-ahmed&amp;catid=66&amp;Itemid=168|journal=Arab World English Journal|volume=7|issue=2|pages=255–267|doi=10.24093/awej/vol7no2.17|issn=2229-9327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bouteilles Bordeaux.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Bordeaux wine]]
'''''En primeur''''' or "wine [[Futures contract|futures]]", is a method of purchasing [[wine]]s early while the wine (a [[vintage]]) is still in the barrel. This offers the customer the opportunity to invest before the wine is bottled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bordeaux Futures: What’s The Upside of Buying En Primeur?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/bordeaux-futures-whats-the-upside-of-buying-en-primeur-1427707701|website=wsj.com|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payment is made at an early stage, a year or 18 months prior to the official release of a vintage. A possible advantage of buying wines ''en primeur'' is that the wines may be considerably cheaper during the ''en primeur'' period than they will be once bottled and released to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why buy them now?      Currently there is strong demand for fine wines. This underlines the need to secure stocks as soon as they are released for sale. If you wait until later, the wine you particularly wished to purchase is likely to have sold out. If not, it is probable (but not guaranteed) that, as the wine matures and stocks become rarer, prices will increase.|url=http://www.thewinesociety.com/about-opening-offers|website=thewinesociety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that is not guaranteed and some wines may lose value over time. Wine experts, like [[Tom Stevenson]], recommend buying ''en primeur'' for wines with very limited quantities and will most likely not be available when they are released.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 66"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 66 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The wines most commonly offered ''en primeur'' are from [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]], [[Rhône wine|the Rhône Valley]] and [[Port wine|Port]], although other regions are adopting the practice.&lt;ref name=wd-g&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kissack|first=Chris, thewinedoctor.com|title=Wine Glossary E|url=http://www.thewinedoctor.com/glossary/e.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[Image:Barrel Tasting.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Barrel samples of the wines are tasted when the wine is between 6 and 8 months old with the wine then giving a preliminary score or rating that influences the ''en primeur'' price.]]
In the spring after a year long [[harvest (wine)|harvest]], merchants and trade organizations will taste barrel samples of wine that are often only 6–8 months old. In the case of Bordeaux, where the final wine is often a blend of several [[grape varieties]], the winemaker will try to craft an approximate blend to sample. The composition of the final wine may differ from the sample depending on how each [[oak (wine)|barrel]] matures during the aging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the way samples are selected for en primeur -|url=http://www.decanter.com/features/should-we-be-worried-about-the-way-samples-are-selected-for-en-primeur-245758/|website=Decanter.com|publisher=Time Inc. (UK) Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the initial sample, the wines will be giving a preliminary "score" or [[wine rating]] based on the expected quality of the wine once it is bottled, released and has had time to mature.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 66"/&gt;

An ''en primeur'' wine gives the owner the right to receive the respective bottles of wines once the producer has completed the maturing phase of the wine. Wine bought ''en primeur'' is often directly placed into custom-free storage holding, [[wines in bond|'in bond']]. Known as a delicate method of investment, a purchase may ultimately be deemed a loss, or there may be considerable profit. For example, the 1982 vintage of [[Château Latour]], was sold at £250 a case ''en primeur'' in 1983, while valued in 2007 at £9,000, although the major part of this price increase occurred after bottling.&lt;ref name=deca&gt;{{Cite web|last= Stimpfig |first=John, ''Decanter''|title=Wine Investment Guide - En primeur vs older vintages |url=http://www.decanter.com/specials/decanters-wine-investment-guide-part-2-75271/#en_primeur }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential benefits===
En primeur can mean the producer is able to benefit from an improved cash flow system and a guaranteed exclusive, potentially high level sale of their product. This concept has existed in [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] for centuries and was only occasionally used in other areas such as [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]], [[Piemonte (wine)|Piedmont]], [[Tuscany]], [[Ribera del Duero]], and [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In [[Italian wine|Italy]] some work is being done to promote the development of an Italian ''en primeur'' market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.decanter.com/wine-news/italian-producers-embrace-en-primeur-106352/|title=Italian producers embrace 'en primeur' - Decanter|date=2002-07-26|work=Decanter|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the consumer, purchasing ''en primeur'' gives them the opportunity to secure wines that may have very limited quantities and be difficult to buy after they are released. As with all investments the consumer is advised to use caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How not to be robbed by the wine spivs  |url=http://www.offshorealert.com/ForumNewTopic.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=37060|website=offshorealert.com|publisher=Jim Budd - Spectator.co.uk DTI (UK)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents of fraud in the "en primeur" market have been significant both in the US and in the UK and in the wine investment sector in general, where many have queried the (lack of) requirements to set up an investment firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wine scam costs investors £110m|url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-82754022/fine-wine-scam-which-has-cost-investors-pounds-sterling-110m|website=standard.co.uk |publisher=The London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In favorable [[vintage]]s some [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855|classified Bordeaux estates]] can have nearly all of the year's inventory allocated or purchased before the wine is released. The purchase price during the ''en primeur'' period may also be lower than the price the wine will be once it is released.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 66"/&gt;

In April 2009, the 2008 en primeur from Bordeaux was released, priced at 30% less (on average) when compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overall, the wines were released 30% down|url=http://www.blog.liv-ex.com/2009/05/|website=blog.liv-ex.com|publisher=LIV EX Fine Wine Market}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has created a huge buying frenzy within the market and investment opportunity has grown.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Gearing - wineinvestment.org&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the record release prices of the 2009 and 2010 vintages tested the resolve of the En Primeur market. Failure to re-adjust prices in the following two years effectively killed demand and many who bought into the 2009s and 10s were facing losses during the following four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insights.liv-ex.com/2013/12/buying-en-primeur-does-it-pay.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However the market has now turned and buying en primeur has become attractive once more. Indeed, those who bought into top wines of the 2014 vintage are now reporting average ROI of +13.4% with the wines soon to be released in bottle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insights.liv-ex.com/2016/10/bordeaux-2014-movers-shakers.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eros'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪər|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛr|ɒ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'' "love" or "desire") is one of [[Greek words for love|the four ancient Greco-Christian terms]]  which can be rendered into English as "[[love]]". The other three are ''[[storge]]'', ''[[philia]]'', and ''[[agape]]''. ''Eros'' refers to "passionate love" or romantic love; ''storge'' to familial love; ''philia'' to friendship as a kind of love; and ''agape'' refers to "selfless love", or "[[charity (virtue)|charity]]" as it is translated in the Christian scriptures (from the Latin ''[[wikt:caritas|caritas]]'', dearness).&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, ''[[The Four Loves]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''[[erotic]]'' is derived from ''eros''. ''Eros'' has also been used in [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to "life energy".

==In literature==

===The classical Greek tradition===
In the classical world, erotic love was generally referred to as a kind of madness or ''theia mania'' ("madness from the gods").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This love passion was described through an elaborate metaphoric and mythological [[schema (psychology)|schema]] involving "love's arrows" or "love darts", the source of which was often the personified figure of [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] (or his Latin counterpart, [[Cupid]]),&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' and the ''[[Heroides]]'' of [[Ovid]] which frequently refer to the overwhelming passion caused by Cupid's darts.&lt;/ref&gt; or another deity (such as [[Pheme|Rumor]]&lt;ref&gt;See Paris's letter to Helen of Troy, in Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' XVI, 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;). At times the source of the arrows was said to be the image of the beautiful love object itself. If these arrows were to arrive at the lover's eyes, they would then travel to and 'pierce' or 'wound' his or her heart and overwhelm him/her with desire and longing ([[lovesickness]]).  The image of the "arrow's wound" was sometimes used to create [[oxymoron]]s and rhetorical [[antithesis]] concerning its pleasure and pain.

"[[Love at first sight]]" was explained as a sudden and immediate beguiling of the lover through the action of these processes, but this was not the only mode of entering into passionate love in classical texts. At times the passion could occur after the initial meeting, as, for example, in [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]]'s letter to [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]] in Ovid's ''Heroides'': "That time I went to Eleusis... it was then most of all (though you had pleased me before) that piercing love lodged in my deepest bones."&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' translated by Grant Showerman.  Second edition revised by G.P. Goold.  Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), IV, 67-70, p 49.  {{ISBN|0-674-99045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, the passion could even precede the first glimpse, as in [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]' letter to [[Helen of Troy]] in the same work, where Paris says that his love for Helen came upon him before he had set eyes on her: "...you were my heart's desire before you were known to me.  I beheld your features with my soul ere I saw them with my eyes; rumour, that told me of you, was the first to deal my wound."&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Heroides and Amores,'' translated by Grant Showerman, second edition revised by G.P. Goold (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), XVI, 36-38, pp. 199-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether by "first sight" or by other routes, passionate love often had disastrous results according to the classical authors.  In the event that the loved one was cruel or uninterested, this desire was shown to drive the lover into a state of depression, causing lamentation and illness.  Occasionally, the loved one was depicted as an unwitting ensnarer of the lover, because of her sublime beauty—a "divine curse" which inspires men to kidnap her or try to rape her.&lt;ref&gt;For more on these tropes in the Ancient Greek novel, see Françoise Létoublon, ''Les Lieux communs du roman: Stéréotypes grecs d'aventure et d'amour'', Leiden: E.J.Brill, 1993.  {{ISBN|90-04-09724-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories in which unwitting men catch sight of the naked body of [[Artemis]] the huntress (and sometimes [[Aphrodite]]) lead to similar ravages (as in the tale of [[Actaeon]]).

===European literature===
The classical conception of love's arrows was developed further by the [[troubadour]] poets of [[Provence]] during the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]], and became part of the European [[courtly love]] tradition. The role of a woman's eyes in eliciting erotic desire was particularly emphasized by the Provençal poets, as N.E. Griffin points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to this description, love originates upon the eyes of the lady when encountered by those of her future lover.  The love thus generated is conveyed on bright beams of light from her eyes to his, through which it passes to take up its abode in his heart.
&lt;ref&gt;See the introduction by Nathaniel Edward Griffin to ''[[Il Filostrato|The Filostrato]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (New York: Bilbo and Tannen, no date. {{ISBN|0-8196-0187-X}}), p.76, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In some medieval texts, the gaze of a beautiful woman is compared to the sight of a [[basilisk]]—a legendary reptile said to have the power to cause death with a single glance.

These images continued to be circulated and elaborated upon in the literature and iconography of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion of the scene of "love at first sight" in fiction, see [[Jean Rousset]], ''"Leurs yeux se rencontrèrent" : la scène de première vue dans le roman'', Paris: José Corti, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] for example, in his ''[[Il Filostrato]]'', mixes the tradition of Cupid's arrow with the Provençal emphasis on the eyes as the birthplace of love: "Nor did he ([[Troilus]]) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart."&lt;ref&gt;[[Giovanni Boccaccio]], ''[[Il Filostrato]]'', canto 1, strophe 29; translation by Nathaniel Edward Griffin and Arthur Beckwith Myrick, p. 147. According to Griffin: "In the description of the enamorment of Troilus is a singular blending of the Provençal conception of the eyes as the birthplace of love with the classical idea of the God of Love with his bows and quiver..." (ibid., p.77, note 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetorical antithesis between the pleasure and pain from love's dart continued through the 17th century, as for example, in these classically inspired images from [[The Fairy-Queen]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Love's a Sweet Passion, why does it torment?&lt;br&gt;If a Bitter, oh tell me whence comes my content?&lt;br&gt;Since I suffer with pleasure, why should I complain,&lt;br&gt;Or grieve at my Fate, when I know 'tis in vain?&lt;br&gt;Yet so pleasing the Pain is, so soft is the Dart,&lt;br&gt;That at once it both wounds me, and Tickles my Heart.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, "If Love's a Sweet Passion", from the libretto of [[Henry Purcell]]'s ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'', act 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In philosophy and psychology==

===Plato===
The ancient philosopher [[Plato]] developed an [[idealistic]] concept of eros which would prove to be very influential in modern times. In general, [[Plato]] did not consider physical attraction to be a necessary part of eros. "[[Platonic love]]" in this original sense can be attained by the intellectual purification of eros from carnal into ideal form. This process is examined in Plato's dialogue the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''. Plato argues there that eros is initially felt for a person, but with contemplation it can become an appreciation for the beauty within that person, or even an appreciation for beauty itself in an ideal sense. As Plato expresses it, eros can help the soul to "remember" beauty in its pure form. It follows from this, for Plato, that eros can contribute to an understanding of truth.

Eros, understood in this sense, differed considerably from the common meaning of the word in the Greek language of Plato's time. It also differed from the meaning of the word in contemporary literature and poetry. For Plato, eros is neither purely human nor purely divine: it is something intermediate which he calls a [[daimon]]. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Its main characteristic is permanent aspiration and desire. Even when it seems to give, eros continues to be a "desire to possess", but nevertheless it is different from a purely sensual love in being the love that tends towards the sublime. According to Plato, the gods do not love, because they do not experience desires, inasmuch as their desires are all satisfied. They can thus only be an object, not a subject of love (''Symposium'' 200-1). For this reason they do not have a direct relationship with man; it is only the mediation of eros that allows the connecting of a relationship (''Symposium'' 203). Eros is thus the way that leads man to divinity, but not vice versa.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Nevertheless, eros remains always, for Plato, an egocentric love: it tends toward conquering and possessing the object that represents a value for man. To love the good signifies to desire to possess it forever. Love is therefore always a desire for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;John Paul II, ''Man and Woman He Created Them: a theology of the body'', translated by Michael Waldstein (Boston: Pauline Books and Media), 47:1 (p.315), footnote 56. See also Anders Nygren, ''Agape and eros'', translated by Philip S. Watson (University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paradoxically, for Plato, the object of eros does not have to be physically beautiful. This is because the object of eros is beauty, and the greatest beauty is eternal, whereas physical beauty is in no way eternal. However, if the lover achieves possession of the beloved's ''inner'' (i.e., ideal) beauty, his need for happiness will be fulfilled, because happiness is the experience of knowing that you are participating in the ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Symposium. 199c5-212c&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sigmund Freud{{anchor|Eros and Sigmund Freud}} ===
In [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychology]], eros, not to be confused with [[libido]], is not exclusively the sex drive, but our life force, the will to live. It is the desire to create life, and favors productivity and construction. In early psychoanalytic writings, instincts from the eros were opposed by forces from the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]. But in later psychoanalytic theory, eros is opposed by the destructive death instinct of [[death drive|Thanatos]] (death instinct or death drive).

In his 1925 paper "The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1925). "The Resistances to Psycho-Analysis", in ''The Collected Papers of Sigmund Freud'', Vol. 5, p.163-74. (Tr. James Strachey.)&lt;/ref&gt; Freud explains that the psychoanalytic concept of sexual energy is more in line with the [[Plato]]nic view of eros, as expressed in the [[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]], than with the common use of the word "sex" as related primarily to genital activity. He also mentions the philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as an influence. He then goes on to confront his adversaries for ignoring such great precursors and for tainting his whole theory of eros with a ''[[pansexual]]'' tendency. He finally writes that his theory naturally explains this collective misunderstanding as a predictable [[Resistance (psychology)|resistance]] to the acknowledgement of sexual activity in childhood.

However, F. M. Cornford finds the standpoints of Plato and of Freud to be "diametrically opposed" with regard to eros. In Plato, eros is a spiritual energy initially, which then "falls" downward; whereas in Freud eros is a physical energy which is "sublimated" upward.&lt;ref&gt;Cornford, F.M. (1950), "The Doctrine of Eros in Plato's Symposium", in ''The Unwritten Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Herbert Marcuse]] appropriated the Freudian concept of eros for his highly influential 1955 work ''[[Eros and Civilization]]''.

===Carl Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s analytical psychology, the counterpart to eros is ''[[logos]]'', a Greek term for the principle of rationality. Jung considers logos to be a masculine principle, while eros is a feminine principle. According to Jung:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Woman's psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Jung]], “Woman in Europe” (1927), in ''Collected Works'' vol. 10, paragraph 255; reprinted in ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This [[gender]]ing of eros and logos is a consequence of Jung's theory of the [[Anima and animus|anima/animus syzygy]] of the human psyche. Syzygy refers to the split between male and female. According to Jung, this split is recapitulated in the unconscious mind by means of "contrasexual" (opposite-gendered) elements called the [[anima and animus|anima]] (in men) and the animus (in women). Thus men have an unconscious feminine principle, the "anima", which is characterized by feminine eros. The work of [[individuation#Carl Gustav Jung|individuation]] for men involves becoming conscious of the anima and learning to accept it as one's own, which entails accepting eros. This is necessary in order to see beyond the [[Psychological projection|projections]] that initially blind the conscious ego. "Taking back the projections" is a major task in the work of individuation, which involves owning and subjectivizing unconscious forces which are initially regarded as alien.&lt;ref&gt;For a critical perspective on this viewpoint, which also summarizes the Jungian position well, see James Hillman, ''The Dream and The Underworld'' (1979), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, Jung's concept of eros is not dissimilar to the Platonic one. Eros is ultimately the desire for wholeness, and although it may initially take the form of passionate love, it is more truly a desire for "psychic relatedness", a desire for interconnection and interaction with other sentient beings. However, Jung was inconsistent, and he did sometimes use the word "eros" as a shorthand to designate sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Hopcke, ''A Guided Tour of the Collected Works of C.G. Jung'', Shambhala Books, 1999, p.45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jp498cc1022ruger.jpg|thumb|A gunsmith customized Ruger 10/22 by Clark Custom Guns.]]
'''Firearm modification''' is commonly done in order to enhance various aspects of the performance of a firearm.  Reasons for these modifications can range from  cosmetic to functional, and can be simple operations that the owner can perform, or complex operations requiring the services of a [[gunsmith]].

==Modifications performed==
Common modifications include:
* Cosmetic and ergonomic modifications
** Replacement or alteration of grips or stocks&lt;ref name=hgd&gt;{{cite book |title=Home Gunsmithing Digest, 2nd Ed. |author=Robert A Steindler |publisher=DBI Books, Inc. |year=1978 |isbn=0-695-81212-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Changing of sights, such as the adjustable [[iron sights]] or a [[telescopic sight]]&lt;ref name=hgd /&gt;
** Adding or removing weight to ease carrying, alter balance, or help moderate [[recoil]]&lt;ref name=hgd /&gt;
** Metal engraving or custom woodwork&lt;ref name=hgd /&gt;
** Checkering or stippling wood or metal&lt;ref name=hgd /&gt;
** Altering the metal finish, using techniques such as [[Bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[electroplating]], or [[parkerizing]]&lt;ref name=hgd /&gt;
** Use of a shorter barrel to reduce size and weight, or a longer barrel to increase velocity
* Caliber conversions
** Rechambering or rebarreling for a new caliber, such as conversions made to chamber a [[wildcat cartridge]]
** Use of a [[caliber conversion sleeve]] or other readily removable insert to fire a smaller, less expensive cartridge
* Operating mechanism conversions
** [[Muzzleloader|Muzzleloading]] or [[paper cartridge]] to metallic cartridge conversions, such as the [[Springfield Model 1866|Allin conversion]] or [[Kammerlader|Lund conversion]]
** Conversion from [[fully automatic]] or [[select fire]] to [[Semi-automatic firearm|semiautomatic]] only or manual operation, or vice versa
** Short recoil to blowback conversions, used in various [[.22 Long Rifle]] conversions, such as the [[Colt Ace]] and J. A. Ceiner conversion kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.22lrconversions.com/ |title=Jonathan Arthur Ciener, Inc. .22LR Conversions |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Conversion from [[handgun]] to [[carbine]] or [[rifle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stellarrigs.com/stellarknife/Carbine_Conversion_Kits.html |title=Carbine conversion kits from Mec-Tec |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Addition of a rifled barrel to a [[shotgun]] to allow it to better fire [[shotgun slug]]s
*[[Accurizing]]
*[[Sporterizing]]

Some commonly customized firearms include the [[Ruger 10/22]] carbine, the [[M1911 pistol]], and the [[AR-15]] rifle, all of which have large numbers of aftermarket parts suppliers.  Shooting disciplines such as [[Bullseye (shooting competition)|bullseye pistol]] and [[benchrest shooting]] also rely extensively on custom-built and modified firearms to achieve top accuracy.

==Legal issues==
Care must be taken when modifying firearms, as some operations may convert a legal firearm into an illegal one.  An example of this is the restrictions in the US [[National Firearms Act]], which define restricted classes of firearms.  Examples of illegal firearms under this act are:
*Rifles with overall lengths under 26 inches, or barrels under 16 inches in length
*Shotguns with overall lengths under 26 inches, or barrels under 18 inches in length
*[[Machine gun]]s
*A conversion to a fixed cartridge of over .50 caliber
These restrictions vary from location to location; some areas may restrict [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]] capacity or require special safety devices such as [[loaded chamber indicator]]s, integral locking mechanisms, magazine disconnects.  Also commonly required are identifying marks such as serial numbers or [[firearm microstamping]] components, removal of which may be illegal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cacodes/pen/12090-12094.html |title=California Penal Code, Section 12090-12094 |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1451-1500/ab_1471_bill_20071013_chaptered.html |title=California AB 1471 |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gun Control Act of 1968]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore - conversion of semi-automatic weapons into select-fire weapons has been illegal for non-SOT holding gunsmiths since the passage of the [[Hughes Amendment]] in 1986. Such weapons may be held only by law enforcement and military only except for "dealer samples" left in the hands of SOT holders. Fully automatic weapons converted to semi-automatic only operation are machine guns per the NFA. The BATFE's policy is "Once a machine gun, always a machine gun."

==Trader and writer==
Ganesh Lal was born in [[Bhimfedi|Bhimphedi]], [[Makwanpur District]] to father Madhav Lal and mother Chandra Kumari [[Shrestha]]. His first wife Chandra Maya died in 1948, and he was married a second time in 1956 to Narayan Devi.

Bhimphedi, located 35&amp;nbsp;km to the southwest of the Nepalese capital [[Kathmandu]], is a market town on the old trade route linking [[India]] and [[Tibet]]. Ganesh Lal's family owned a store shop which sold general merchandise and cloth. Ganesh Lal looked after the shop and spent his free time composing songs. During festivals, he took part in stage performances and music recitals.

Bhimphedi began to wither after the district headquarters was shifted to [[Hetauda]]. Subsequently, Ganesh Lal moved there and opened a cloth shop. He died in Hetauda.

In 1999, a statue of Ganesh Lal was erected on the premises of Nepal Bhasa Khala in Hetauda.

'''Ingrid Jonker''' (19 September 1933 – 19 July 1965) ([[Order of Ikhamanga|OIS]]), was a [[South Africa]]n [[poet]]. While she wrote in [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], her poems have been widely translated into other languages.  Jonker has reached [[icon]]ic status in South Africa and is often called the South African [[Sylvia Plath]], owing to the intensity of her work and the tragic course of her turbulent life.

==Early life==
Jonker was born on a farm in [[Douglas, Northern Cape]]. She was the daughter of [[Abraham Jonker]] and Beatrice Cilliers. Her parents separated before she was born, and Jonker’s mother moved back home with her two daughters. Jonker’s grandparents moved to a farm near [[Cape Town, South Africa|Cape Town]]. Five years after the move, her grandfather died, leaving the four women destitute.

In 1943, when Ingrid was ten years old, Jonker’s mother committed suicide after her descent into depression in the years after her father had thrown his wife and children out of his life in disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;"Ingrid Jonker: Poet of pain and freedom." (PDF). The Sunday Times. Retrieved 2009-06-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonker and her older sister Anna were then sent to [[Wynberg Girls' High School|Wynberg Girls&amp;rsquo; High School]] in Cape Town, where she began writing poetry for the school magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ingrid Jonker: Poet of pain and freedom. | url = http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/MultimediaContent/IngridJonker/Jonker_p1.pdf | publisher = The Sunday Times | accessdate = 2009-06-06 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110817202310/http://heritage.thetimes.co.za/MultimediaContent/IngridJonker/Jonker_p1.pdf | archivedate = 17 August 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonker1946"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Jonker | first = Ingrid | title= Die baba | journal = The Wynberg Girls High School Magazine | volume = 31  | year = 1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They later moved in with their father and his third wife and their children. The two sisters were treated as outsiders, which caused a permanent rift between Jonker and her father.

==Poet==
Ingrid Jonker started writing poems when she was six years old and, by the age of sixteen, she had started a correspondence with [[D.J. Opperman]], South African writer and poet, whose views influenced her work greatly.

Her first collection of Afrikaans poems, ''Na die somer'' (“After the summer”) was produced before she was thirteen. Although several publishers were interested in her work, she was advised to wait before going into print. Her first published book of poems, ''Ontvlugting'' (“Escape”), was eventually published in 1956.

Ingrid Jonker married Pieter Venter in 1956, and their daughter Simone was born in 1957. The couple moved to [[Johannesburg]], but three years later they separated.  Jonker and her daughter then moved back to Cape Town.

Her father, already a writer, editor and [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] Member of Parliament, was appointed chairman of the parliamentary select committee responsible for censorship laws on art, publications and entertainment. To Abraham Jonker's embarrassment, his daughter was vehemently opposed to the censorship laws he was charged with enforcing and their political differences became public. In a speech in parliament Jonker's father denied her as his daughter.

During the same time period she had relationships with two writers, [[Jack Cope]] and [[André Brink]]. She became pregnant and had an abortion, even though abortion was illegal in South Africa at the time. The depression caused by her father's rejection of her and by her abortion forced Ingrid to enter the [[Valkenberg Hospital|Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital]] in 1961. (Jonker's mother had died at Valkenberg several years before.)

Jonker's next collection of poems ''Rook en oker'' ("Smoke and Ochre") was published in 1963 after delays caused by her publishers. While the anthology was praised by most South African writers, poets and critics, it was given a cool reception by supporters of the ruling Party.

Thereafter, Ingrid Jonker became known as one of the ''[[Die Sestigers]]'', a group that also included [[Breyten Breytenbach]], [[André Brink]], [[Adam Small (writer)|Adam Small]] and [[Bartho Smit]], who were challenging the extreme [[Afrikaner nationalism]] of the ruling National Party.

''Rook en oker'' won Jonker the £1000 ''Afrikaanse Pers-Boekhandel'' (Afrikaans Press-Booksellers) Literary Award, as well as a scholarship from the [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American Corporation]]. The money helped her to realize her dream of travelling to [[Europe]], where she went to England, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal. She asked Jack Cope to accompany her, but he refused. Jonker then asked André Brink to join her. He accepted and they went to Paris and Barcelona together. During the trip Brink decided against leaving his wife for Jonker and went back to South Africa.  Jonker then cut her tour short and returned to Cape Town.

Jonker had started writing a new collection of poems just before her death. A selection of these poems was published posthumously in the collection ''Kantelson'' ("Toppling Sun"). She then witnessed a shattering event; a black baby was shot and died in his mother’s arms. She underlined from [[Dylan Thomas]]; "after the first death, there is no other". She wrote ''Die kind (wat doodgeskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga)'' ("The child (who was shot dead by soldiers at Nyanga)").

== Death==
During the night of 19 July 1965, Ingrid Jonker went down to the beach at [[Three Anchor Bay]] in [[Cape Town]], walked into the sea, and committed [[suicide]] by [[drowning]].&lt;ref name="RTA"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ingrid Jonker, famous in life, legend in death|url=http://roadtravelafrica.com/2011/10/11/ingrid-jonker-famous-in-life-legend-in-death/|accessdate=January 24, 2016|publisher=Road Travel Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright and papers==
After Jonker's death, copyrights and control of her [[literary estate]] and papers were awarded to Jack Cope by the Master of the Court. He established the Ingrid Jonker Trust. He remained a trustee of the Trust until his death in 1991. Jonker's daughter Simone Venter is the beneficiary. Copyright is still vested in the Trust.

Jonker's literary papers went to the National English Literary Museum (NELM) in [[Grahamstown]].  Her sister Anna Jonker borrowed these with the intention of writing a biography on her sister.  November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Henk van Woerden died on November 16th 2005. | url = http://www.henkvanwoerden.nl/index.html?pid=79 | publisher = Uitgeverij Podium | accessdate = 2009-12-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070502084303/http://www.henkvanwoerden.nl/index.html?pid=79 | archivedate = 2 May 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Ingrid Jonker - Die kind.JPG|thumb|right|''Die Kind'' as a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall poem in Leiden]] ]]
Jonker's poetry has been translated from Afrikaans into English, [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], among others. She wrote a one-act play ''{{'}}n Seun na my Hart'' ("A son after my heart") about a mother's illusions about her handicapped son. Jonker also wrote several short stories.

The prestigious [[Ingrid Jonker Prize]] for the best debut work of Afrikaans or English poetry was instituted by her friends to honour her legacy after her burial in 1965. This yearly prize, consisting of R1000 and a medal, is awarded alternately to an Afrikaans or English poet who has published a first volume in the previous two years.

[[Nelson Mandela]] read her poem, ''Die kind (wat doodgeskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga)'' ("The child (who was shot dead by soldiers at Nyanga)"), in English translation, during his address at the opening of the first democratically elected Parliament on 24 May 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/or/or87-19.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219224620/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/or/or87-19.html |date=19 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 a documentary about Jonker was produced for Dutch television by Saskia van Schaik: ''Korreltjie niks is my dood''.

In 2002 the one-woman, interactive play by [[Ryk Hattingh]], ''Opdrag: Ingrid Jonker'' ("Assignment: Ingrid Jonker"), was staged at the [[Grahamstown|Grahamstown National Arts Festival]] starring [[Jana Cilliers]]. The play dealt with questions and comments on Jonker’s life, interwoven with her poems and other writing.

In April 2004 Jonker was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Ikhamanga]] by the South African government for "her excellent contribution to literature and a commitment to the struggle for human rights and democracy in South Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutgovt/orders/2004/jonker.htm |title=About Government - National Orders |publisher=Info.gov.za |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505040814/http://www.info.gov.za/aboutgovt/orders/2004/jonker.htm |archivedate=5 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of her poems have been set to music over the years, beginning with the song cycle ''Vyf liedere'' for soprano and piano by [[Stefans Grové]] (1981), and sung by such artists as [[Laurika Rauch]], [[Anneli van Rooyen]] and [[Chris Chameleon]].

In 2005 [[Chris Chameleon]] (known better as the lead singer of the South African band [[Boo! (band)|Boo!]]) released the album ''Ek Herhaal Jou'' ("I Repeat You"), which consisted of a number of Jonker's poems that he had set to music.  The release coincided with the 40th anniversary of Jonker's death. Some of Jonker's poems that inspired Chameleon's songs are ''Bitterbessie Dagbreek'' ("Bitterberry Daybreak"), ''Lied van die gebreekte Riete'' ("Song of the Broken Reeds") and ''Ontvlugting'' ("Escape").

In 2007 a documentary ''[[Ingrid Jonker, her Lives and Time]]'' by [[Mozambique]]-born South African film and documentary maker [[Helena Nogueira]] was released in South Africa. Hailed as the definitive work on Jonker this is the first literary [[Documentary film|documentary]] to receive theatrical release in South Africa.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingridjonker.com |title=Under Construction |publisher=Ingridjonker.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005013134/http://www.ingridjonker.com/ |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 2007 work was already underway on a feature film about Ingrid Jonker with the working title ''[[All that Breaks]]''. Based on a script by Helena Nogueira workshopped at [[Johannesburg]]'s Market Theatre, the film focusses on three years in the life of Jonker and the ''[[Sestigers]]'' who gathered around poet [[Uys Krige]] at Clifton in [[Cape Town]]. The film is produced by [[David Parfitt]] (''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''), [[Charles Moore (film producer)|Charles Moore]] (''[[Schindler's List]]''){{Clarify|reason=The article and imdb entry for Schindler's List don't mention a Charles Moore|date=October 2014}} and Shan Moodley and is directed by Nogueira.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 2011, Dutch actress [[Carice van Houten]] played Ingrid Jonker in the [[biopic]] ''[[Black Butterflies]]'', directed by [[Paula van der Oest]]. The film also starred Irish actor [[Liam Cunningham]] as [[Jack Cope]] and [[Rutger Hauer]] as Abraham Jonker. Despite being a fully Dutch production about a poet who spoke and wrote in [[Afrikaans]], ''Black Butterflies'' was filmed entirely in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/news/1089141/61/Tweede_Engelstalige_film_voor_Carice_van_Houten.html |title=Tweede Engelstalige film voor Carice van Houten (video) &amp;#124; nu.nl/achterklap &amp;#124; Het laatste nieuws het eerst op |publisher=Nu.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, South African musician [[Chris Chameleon]] released an album of Jonker's works, entitled ''As Jy Weer Skryf'' ("If You Write Again").

In 2012, Nicola Haskins choreographered a dance drama which told the life story of Jonker for the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown and then later to be performed at various venues including the [[University of Pretoria]].

==Biography==
Jonker's biographer is Petrovna Metelerkamp, who published ''Ingrid Jonker – Beeld van 'n digterslewe'' ("Ingrid Jonker – Image of a Poet's Life") in 2003.  This book contains new insights into the poet's life, and includes love letters (some unsent) and an as yet unpublished account of the night of Jonker's death by her friend, Bonnie Davidtsz.  The proceeds of the book are said to assist Simone Venter (Jonker's daughter) financially. An English, updated version of this biography appeared in 2012: ''Ingrid Jonker - A Poet's Life''.

'''Jan Olof Lennart Olsson''' (pen name '''Jolo''') (31 March 1920 [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] — 30 April 1974, [[Hjärnarp]], [[Skåne]]) was a popular [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer and a journalist for the [[Swedish newspaper]] ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' where he elevated the short sketch to an art. He was married to [[Margareta Sjögren]], a journalist at another Swedish newspaper.

Olsson is most known for his books about [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], in Swedish named ''[[Den okände soldaten]]'' (1965; ''The unknown soldier'') and ''[[Någonstans i Sverige]]'' (1974; ''Somewhere in Sweden''), and several essays on popular history has been issued as books.

He also wrote a large number of travel books. In both fields his real strength lies in his ability to use vivid and picturesque situations to illustrate general patterns.

Later he supported and helped the Indian freedom fighters by weapons. In 1903 he had written "Chetavani ra Chugatiya" of 13 couplets, to stop the [[Udaipur State]] king [[Maharana Fateh Singh|Fateh Singh]] to participate in the meeting called by British Viceroy [[Lord Curzon]]. On 2 March 1914, he was caught by the help of Shahpura king Raja Nahar Singh and charged with the murder of sage Pyare Lal and Raj droh. He was sent to jail for 20 years in [[Hazaribagh]], [[Bihar]]. During his visit to jail, he developed his own form of mixed martial arts, which he called Camwai.  This art form is commonly used by Italian swat teams to infiltrate into smoke filled buildings. After jail, he again started his work against the British rulers by his writings.

Other objectives of the General Assembly was: -

"State religious, social, moral, economic, mental, physical and Public benevolent powers to attempt at all-round development " . The fundamentals of his letter can be shown in these lines, " प्रजा केवल पैसा ढालने की प्यारी मशीन है और शासन उन पैसों को उठा लेने का यंत्र " ....... शासन शैली ना पुरानी ही रही ना नवीन बनी , न वैसी एकाधिपथ्य सत्ता ही रही न पूरी ब्यूरोक्रेसी ही बनी | ........ अग्नि को चादर से ढकना भ्रम है -खेल है- या छल है मेरी यही शाक्षी देती है | "

== After Life ==
In the year 1920-21 Kesari Singh moved to [[Wardha]] because of inviting by Seth [[Jamnalal Bajaj]] where [[Vijay Singh Pathik]] was already present as a public servant.

'''''La chingada''''' is a term commonly used in colloquial, even crass, [[Mexican Spanish]] that refers to various conditions or situations of, generally, negative connotations.

The concept of "la chingada" has been famously analysed by [[Octavio Paz]] in his book ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]''.

==Spanish uses of the expression==

'''Lexxe''' is an internet [[search engine]] that applies [[Natural Language Processing]]
in its [[semantic search]] technology.  Founded in 2005 by Dr. Hong Liang Qiao,
Lexxe is based in Sydney, Australia.

Lexxe launched its Alpha version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Search Engine that Answers Questions|first=Fugang|last=Xu|publisher=The China Broadcast|date=2005-11-08|url= http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2238/2005-10-10/33@275908.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005, featuring Natural Language question
answering (i.e. users could ask questions in English to the search engine apart from keyword searches — this feature has been suspended for redevelopment since 2010).

In 2011, Lexxe launched Beta version &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lexxe to Launch Beta Version of Search Engine|last=Guo|publisher=China Radio International|date=2011-09-23|url=http://english.cri.cn/6909/2011/09/23/2743s659726.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aussie Lexxe challenges search engines|first=Michael|last=Lee|publisher=ZDNet|date=2011-11-03|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/aussie-lexxe-challenges-search-engines-339325469.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new search technology called Semantic Key.  Semantic Keys enable users to query with a conceptual keyword
(or a keyword with a special meaning, hence the term Semantic Key) in order
to find instances under the concept, e.g. price → $5.95 or €200, color →
red, yellow, white.  For example, “price: a pound of apples”, “color:
ferrari”.  With initial 500 Semantic Keys at the Beta launch, Lexxe
became the first search engine in the world to offer this unique and useful
search technology to the users.

In human communication, Semantic Keys are common in questions and
information exchange.  Likewise, they could be a useful tool for search
engines between users and internet information, particularly when dealing
with unstructured data.

Lexxe Beta version also supports normal keyword search.

On June 17, 2015, Lexxe closed down its beta version service. However, there are plans to launch a new Lexxe search engine.&lt;ref&gt;This information appears on the main page of the [http://www.lexxe.com/ lexxe.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
An element needed to carry out commercial transactions is a common language understood by all parties involved in early trade. Historians such as J.V. Sebastian, K.T. Thirunavukkarasu, and A.W. Hamilton record that Tamil was the common language of commerce in Malaysia and Indonesia during historical times.
The maritime Tamil significance in Sumatran and Malay Peninsula trading continued for centuries and borrowings into Malay from Tamil increased between the 15th and 19th centuries due to their commercial activities. In the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company was obliged to use Tamil as part of its correspondence. In Malacca and other seaports up to the 19th century, Malay terminology pertaining to book-keeping and accountancy was still largely Tamil.

Borrowings into Malay from Tamil (sometimes Sanskritized) include such everyday words as:

'''''Meh''''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɛ|}}) is an [[interjection]] used as an expression of [[Indifference (emotion)|indifference]] or [[boredom]]. It is often regarded as a verbal equivalent of a shrug of the shoulders. The use of the term ''"meh"'' shows that the speaker is apathetic, uninterested, or indifferent to the question or subject at hand. It is occasionally used as an [[adjective]], meaning something is mediocre or unremarkable.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite news |title=Bothered much? 'Meh' is a word |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207120355/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Strange-News/Meh-New-Word-In-Collins-English-Dictionary-Slacker-Term-Enters-Lexicon/Article/200811315152720|archivedate=7 February 2009|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Strange-News/Meh-New-Word-In-Collins-English-Dictionary-Slacker-Term-Enters-Lexicon/Article/200811315152720|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=November 17, 2008|accessdate=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==

''Meh'' is popularly used as a catch-all answer to any question. It is acceptably interchangeable with most responses.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"What time do you want to go out tonight?" "Meh."'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Also considered a non-committal response, "meh" can be used when disregarding a question or to refer to something they have no opinion or emotions about. In expressing an opinion, it means the speaker's opinion is that of apathy. However, some may respond with "meh" simply to avoid creating an opinion on the matter at all.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite news |url= http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/yes-we-believe-that-pizza-is-meh/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1|title=The Death of Meh|work=[[Babble RSS]] |author=Seth Taylor |date=January 14, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"Do you want to go to the party with me?" "Meh."'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"What did you think about the book we had to read?" "Meh."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin==
The origin is unknown. Some have speculated that the term's origin is [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] because of its similarity to the interjection "[[wikt:feh|feh]]",&lt;ref name=zimmer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/06/meh_etymology_tracing_the_yiddish_word_from_leo_rosten_to_auden_to_the_simpsons.html |title=A History of Meh, from Leo Rosten to Auden to The Simpsons  |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |author=[[Benjamin Zimmer]] |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which appears in the 1936 Yiddish song [[Yidl Mitn Fidl]]. In [[Alexander Harkavy]]'s ''"Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary"'' the word is treated as a bleating or baa sound. ''Hooray for Yiddish'', by [[Leo Rosten]] uses the word ''"mnyeh"'', which is speculated to be an early variant of ''"meh"''.&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt;

==Popularization==
As early as 1992, "meh" appeared in a [[Usenet]] [http://groups.google.com/group/soc.motss/msg/df2d70d0143f315d posting] in a discussion referring to the television series ''[[Melrose Place]]''.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite news |title='Meh' joins ranks of little words that do grunt work |author= |first=Nathan |last=Bierma |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-04-13/features/0704110969_1_yiddish-simpsons-bart |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=April 13, 2007 |page=2 |accessdate=2010-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Meh''{{'}}s popularity surged after its use on the American animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpsons Channel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonschannel.com/2008/11/meh-the-simpsons-make-word-history/ |title='Meh' - The Simpsons Make Word History |last1= |first1= |date=November 19, 2008 |publisher=Simpsons Channel |accessdate=18 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616081830/http://www.simpsonschannel.com/2008/11/meh-the-simpsons-make-word-history/ |archivedate=June 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used in the 1994 episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]",&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt; when a librarian reacts to Lisa's surprise that voting records are not classified. It also appeared later in "[[Lisa's Wedding]]" after [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] weaves the words "Hi [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]" on a loom to try to pique her son's interest in weaving, to which he responds "meh". In the 2001 episode "[[Hungry, Hungry Homer]]", Lisa spells out the word for emphasis ("M-E-H"), after Homer tries to interest her (Lisa) and Bart into going to the theme park "Blockoland". &lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt; American [[lexicographer]] [[Benjamin Zimmer]] wrote in 2006, "Whatever Yiddish origins the interjection might have had, they have been lost in post-''Simpsons'' usage."&lt;ref name="Visual Thesaurus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/meh-fail-gop-debate-elicits-words-of-disappointment/ |title='Meh? Fail? GOP Debate Elicits Words of Disappointment' |publisher=Visual Thesaurus|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmer contacted ''Simpsons'' writer [[John Swartzwelder]], who was responsible for "Hungry Hungry Homer," who said  "I had originally heard the word from an advertising writer named Howie Krakow back in 1970 or 1971 who insisted it was the funniest word in the world."&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt; Zimmer also contacted the writers of the other two episodes but they could not remember where they had heard the word.&lt;ref name=zimmer/&gt;

Lexicographer [[Grant Barrett]] wrote about ''meh'' and ''[[d'oh]]'', another ''Simpsons'' catchphrase: "I suspect they're both just transcribed versions of oral speech, which has any number of single-syllable sounds that mean a variety of things."&lt;ref name=Tribune /&gt;

Even mainstream publications have adopted usage of "meh". The word's first mainstream print usage occurred in Canadian newspaper the ''[[Edmonton Sun]]'' in 2003: "Ryan Opray got voted off ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]].'' Meh".&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Steve (May 5, 2007). "Meh...: A little word replaces the indifference of 'whatever'&amp;nbsp;– like you care", ''[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]'', p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, ''meh'' was included in the ''BBC News Online'' list of 20 words which defined the decade.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, Susie (2009-12-14). Words: The final 20. In ''A portrait of the decade'', BBC News, 14 December 2009. Retrieved from http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8406898.stm.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, 2013 ''[[ABC News]]'' posted on their website under headlines: ''US Government Shuts Down, World Says, 'Meh.'''&lt;ref name=Good&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/10/headlines-us-government-shuts-down-world-says-meh |title=Headlines: US Government Shuts Down, World Says, 'Meh'|work=[[ABC News Network]] |author=[[Chris Good]] |date=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'s'' ''The One Page Magazine'' now features a "meh" list.&lt;ref name=Stalley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babble.com/babble-voices/dad-overboard-seth-taylor/the-death-of-meh |title=Yes, We Believe That Pizza Is Meh|work=[[The New York Times]] |author=[[Willy Stalley]] |date=January 27, 2014 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Collins English Dictionary''==
In November 2008, the word was added to the ''[[Collins Dictionary|Collins English Dictionary]]'', a British publication published by [[HarperCollins]].&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, Ben (November 17, 2008). "Looking for a word to describe how bored you are? Try meh", ''[[The Times]]'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Cormac McKeown, senior editor for Collins dictionaries, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a new interjection from the US that seems to have inveigled its way into common speech over here".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was actually spelled out in ''The Simpsons'' when [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is trying to pry the kids away from the TV with a suggestion for a day trip. They both just reply 'meh' and keep watching TV; he asks again and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] says 'We said MEH! M-E-H, meh?!' "&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Sam Leith]], writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', described the addition of the word, following suggestions received from the public, as a "gimmick", before concluding it was a "useful" word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Leith |title='Meh' is more useful than 'weaselnose' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3563562/Meh-is-more-useful-than-weaselnose.html |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |date=November 17, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===
Harper Collins' definition of "meh" included a "real example" of usage:

{{quote|"As in 'the Canadian election was so meh'."&lt;ref name="can"/&gt;}}

When complaints arose over this choice of example, Harper Collins' lexicographer Cormac McKeown, who chose the election reference, insisted that he meant "no slight to Canada".&lt;ref name="can"&gt;{{cite news |last=Boswell |first=Randy |title=Canadian politics: The definition of 'meh' |date=November 18, 2008 |work=[[Canwest News Service]] |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=f216bac2-8f0b-4202-a1ae-8f7ed4de2bd7 |accessdate=December 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113152656/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=f216bac2-8f0b-4202-a1ae-8f7ed4de2bd7 |archivedate=January 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Korean language]] has changed between the two states due to the length of time that North and South Korea have been separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sang-Hun|first1=Choe|title=Koreas: Divided by a Common Language |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/world/asia/30iht-dialect.2644361.html?_r=0|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=The New York Times/ International Herald Tribune|date=30 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Korean orthography]], as defined by the [[Hangul Society|Korean Language Society]] in 1933 in the "Proposal for Unified Korean Orthography" ({{Ko-hhrm|한글 맞춤법 통일안||Hangeul Matchumbeop Tong-iran}}) continued to be used by the North and the South after liberation of Korea in 1945, but with the establishments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea in 1948, the two states have taken on differing policies regarding the language. In 1954, North Korea set out the rules for Korean orthography ({{lang|ko|조선어 철자법}} ''{{transl|kor|RR|Josŏnŏ Chŏljabŏp}}''). Although this was only a minor revision in orthography that created little difference from that used in the South, from then on, the standard language in the North and the South gradually differed more and more from each other.

In the 1960s, under the influence of the ''[[Juche]]'' ideology came a big change in linguistic policies in North Korea. On 3 January 1964, [[Kim Il-sung]] issued his teachings on "A Number of Issues on the Development of the Korean language" ({{lang|ko|조선어를 발전시키기 위한 몇 가지 문제}} ''Josŏnŏrŭl Paljŏn Siki'gi Wihan Myŏt' Kaji Munje''), and on 14 May 1966 on the topic "In Rightly Advancing the National Characteristics of the Korean language" ({{lang|ko|조선어의 민족적 특성을 옳게 살려 나갈 데 대하여}} ''Josŏnŏŭi Minjokchŏk T'ŭksŏngŭl Olge Sallyŏ Nagal Te Taehayŏ''), from which the "Standard Korean Language" ({{lang|ko|조선말규범집}} ''Josŏnmalgyubŏmjip'') rules followed in the same year, issued by the National Language Revision Committee that was directly under the control of the cabinet. From then on, more important differences came about between the standard language in the North and the South. In 1987, North Korea revised the aforementioned rules further, and these have remained in use until today. In addition, the rules for spacing were separately laid out in the "Standard Spacing Rules in Writing Korean" ({{lang|ko|조선말 띄여쓰기규범}} ''Josŏnmal Ttŭiyŏssŭgigyubŏm'') in 2000 but have since been superseded by "Rules for Spacing in Writing Korean" ({{lang|ko|띄여쓰기규정}} ''Ttŭiyŏssŭgigyujŏng''), issued in 2003.

South Korea continued to use the ''{{transl|ko|RR|Hangeul Matchumbeop Tong-iran}}'' as defined in 1933, until its amendment "Korean Orthography" ({{lang|ko|한글 맞춤법}} ''{{transl|ko|RR|Hangeul Matchumbeop}}''), together with "Standard Language Regulations" ({{lang|ko|표준어 규정: pyojuneo gyujeong}}), were issued in 1988, which remain in use today.

As with the [[Korean phonology]] article, this article uses [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols in pipes {{IPA|{{pipe}}&amp;nbsp;{{pipe}}}} for [[morphophonemic]]s, slashes {{IPA|/&amp;nbsp;/}} for [[phoneme]]s, and brackets {{IPA|[&amp;nbsp;]}} for [[allophone]]s. Pan-Korean romanized words are largely in [[Revised Romanization]], and North Korean-specific romanized words are largely in [[McCune-Reischauer]]. Also, for the sake of consistency, this article also phonetically transcribes {{lang|ko|ㅓ}} as {{IPA|/ʌ/}} for pan-Korean and South-specific phonology, and as {{IPA|/ɔ/}} for North-specific phonology.

==Hangul (Chosŏn'gŭl)==
The same [[hangul]] (''Chosŏn'gŭl'') letters are used to write the language in the North and the South. However, in the North, the stroke that distinguishes ㅌ {{IPA|{{pipe}}tʰ{{pipe}}}} from ㄷ {{IPA|{{pipe}}t{{pipe}}}} is written above rather than inside the letter as in the South.

In the South, the vowel [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s ㅐ {{IPA|{{pipe}}ɛ{{pipe}}}}, ㅒ {{IPA|{{pipe}}jɛ{{pipe}}}}, ㅔ {{IPA|{{pipe}}e{{pipe}}}}, ㅖ {{IPA|{{pipe}}je{{pipe}}}}, ㅘ {{IPA|{{pipe}}wa{{pipe}}}}, ㅙ {{IPA|{{pipe}}wɛ{{pipe}}}}, ㅚ {{IPA|{{pipe}}ø{{pipe}}}}, ㅝ {{IPA|{{pipe}}wʌ{{pipe}}}}, ㅞ {{IPA|{{pipe}}we{{pipe}}}}, ㅟ {{IPA|{{pipe}}y{{pipe}}}}, ㅢ {{IPA|{{pipe}}ɰi{{pipe}}}} and the consonant digraphs ㄲ {{IPA|{{pipe}}k͈{{pipe}}}}, ㄸ {{IPA|{{pipe}}t͈{{pipe}}}}, ㅃ {{IPA|{{pipe}}p͈{{pipe}}}}, ㅆ {{IPA|{{pipe}}s͈{{pipe}}}}, ㅉ {{IPA|{{pipe}}tɕ͈{{pipe}}}} are not treated as separate letters, whereas in the North they are.
Some letters and digraphs have different names in the North and in the South.

The names used in the South are the ones found in the ''Hunmongjahoe'' ([[:ko:훈몽자회|훈몽자회]], 訓蒙字會, published 1527). The names used in the North are formed mechanically with the pattern "letter + 이 + 으 + letter". Also for the tensed consonants, in the South, they are called "double" (쌍- {{IPA|/s͈aŋ-/}}) consonants, while in the North, they are called "strong" (된- {{IPA|/tøːn-/}}) consonants.

In the North, consonant vowel digraphs are treated as letters in their own right and are ordered after the end of the simple consonant and vowel letters. In the South, the digraphs come between the basic letters. For example, after {{lang|ko|ㅏ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}a{{pipe}}}} comes the diphthong {{lang|ko|ㅐ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}ɛ{{pipe}}}}, the combination of {{lang|ko|ㅏ}} and {{lang|ko|ㅣ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}i{{pipe}}}}; or after {{lang|ko|ㅗ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}o{{pipe}}}} come the diphthongs {{lang|ko|ㅘ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}wa{{pipe}}}}, {{lang|ko|ㅙ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}wɛ{{pipe}}}} and {{lang|ko|ㅚ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}ø{{pipe}}}}, which begin with {{lang|ko|ㅗ}}, and so on. Also, the consonant letter {{lang|ko|ㅇ}} ({{IPA|{{pipe}}∅{{pipe}}}} and {{IPA|{{pipe}}ŋ{{pipe}}}}) is placed between {{lang|ko|ㅅ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}s{{pipe}}}} and {{lang|ko|ㅈ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}tɕ{{pipe}}}} in the North when pronounced {{IPA|{{pipe}}ŋ{{pipe}}}}, but after all consonants (after {{lang|ko|ㅉ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}tɕ͈{{pipe}}}}) when used as a placeholder indicating a null initial consonant (for syllables that begin with a vowel).

==Pronunciation==
[[File:Koreandialects.png|thumb|180px|Dialects of Korean]]
The standard languages in the North and the South share the same types and the same number of [[phoneme]]s, but there are some differences in the actual pronunciations. The South Korean standard pronunciation is based on the [[Korean dialects|dialect]] as spoken in [[Seoul]], and the North Korean standard pronunciation is based on the dialect as spoken in [[Pyongyang]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Consonants===
The following differences are recognised in the consonants. In the Seoul dialect, ㅈ, ㅊ and ㅉ are typically pronounced with alveolo-palatal affricates {{IPA|[tɕ]}}, {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}}, {{IPA|[tɕ͈]}}. In the Pyongyang dialect, they are typically pronounced with alveolar affricates {{IPA|[ts]}}, {{IPA|[tsʰ]}}, {{IPA|[ts͈]}}. Also, {{lang|ko|지}} and {{lang|ko|시}} can be pronounced without palatalisation as {{IPA|[tsi]}} and {{IPA|[si]}} in the Pyongyang dialect.

In Sino-Korean words, some of {{lang|ko|ㄴ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}n{{pipe}}}} and all of {{lang|ko|ㄹ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}l{{pipe}}}} that come in the beginning of a word are dropped in pronunciation and not written out in the South, but all initial {{lang|ko|ㄴ}} and {{lang|ko|ㄹ}} are written out in the North. For instance, the common last name 이 {{IPA|[i]}} (often written out in English as [[Lee (Korean surname)|Lee]], seemingly staying true to the North Korean typography and pronunciation), is written and pronounced as 리 {{IPA|[ɾi]}} in North Korean. Furthermore, the South Korean word 여자 {{IPA|[jʌdʑa]}}, meaning woman, is similarly written as 녀자 {{IPA|[njɔdʑa]}} in North Korea. But as this latter pronunciation was artificially crafted in the 1960s, it is common for older speakers to be unable to pronounce initial {{lang|ko|ㄴ}} and {{lang|ko|ㄹ}} properly, thus pronouncing such words in the same way as they are pronounced in the South.

The [[liquid consonant]] {{ipa|[ɾ]}} does not come after the [[nasal consonant]]s {{ipa|[m]}} and {{ipa|[ŋ]}}. In this position, {{lang|ko|ㄹ}} is pronounced as {{ipa|[n]}} rather than {{ipa|[ɾ]}}. But in North Korea, {{lang|ko|ㄹ}} before vowels {{lang|ko|ㅑ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅕ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅛ}}, and {{lang|ko|ㅠ}} can remain {{ipa|[ɾ]}} in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|ko:조선말 규범집 (2010)/문화어발음법#제8장 닮기현상이 일어날 때의 발음|Article 24 in Chapter 8 of the revised Compendium of Korean Language Norms 2010}} {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
The following differences are recognised in the vowels. The vowel ㅓ {{IPA|/ʌ/}} is not as rounded in the Seoul dialect as it is in the Pyongyang dialect. If expressed in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], it would be {{IPA|[ʌ̹]}} or {{IPA|[ɔ̜]}} for the one in Seoul dialect and {{IPA|[ɔ]}} for the one in Pyongyang dialect. Due to this [[roundedness]], speakers of the Seoul dialect would find that ㅓ as pronounced by speakers of the Pyongyang dialect sounds close to the vowel ㅗ {{IPA|/o/}}. Additionally, the difference between the vowels {{lang|ko|ㅐ}} {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{lang|ko|ㅔ}} {{IPA|/e/}} is slowly diminishing amongst the younger speakers of the Seoul dialect. It is not well known if this is also happening with the Pyongyang dialect.

===Pitch===
The pitch patterns in the Pyongyang and Seoul dialects differ, but there has been little research in detail. On the other hand, in the ''Chosŏnmal Taesajŏn'' (조선말대사전), published in 1992, where the pitches for certain words are shown in a three-pitch system, a word such as 꾀꼬리 ({{IPA|[k͈øk͈oɾi]}} – Korean nightingale) is marked as having pitch "232" (where "2" is low and "3" is high), from which one can see some difference in pitch patterns from the Seoul dialect.

==Orthography==
===Inflected words===

In words in which the word stem ends in ㅣ {{IPA|{{pipe}}i{{pipe}}}}, ㅐ {{IPA|{{pipe}}ɛ{{pipe}}}}, ㅔ {{IPA|{{pipe}}e{{pipe}}}}, ㅚ {{IPA|{{pipe}}ø{{pipe}}}}, ㅟ {{IPA|{{pipe}}y{{pipe}}}}, ㅢ {{IPA|{{pipe}}ɰi{{pipe}}}}, in forms where -어 {{IPA|/-ʌ/}} is appended to these endings in the South, but -여 {{IPA|/-jɔ/}} is instead appended in the North. In actual pronunciation, however, the {{IPA|[j]}} sound often accompanies the pronunciation of such words, even in the South.

====ㅂ-irregular inflections====
In the South, when the word root of a ㅂ-irregular inflected word has two or more syllables (for example, 고맙다 {{IPA|[komap̚t͈a]}} ''gomapda''), the ㅂ is dropped and replaced with 우 in the next syllable. When conjugated to the polite speech level, the ㅂ-irregular stem resyllabifies with the 어요 ''-eoyo'' conjugation to form 워요 ''-woyo'' (as in 고맙다 ''gomapda'' → 고마우 ''gomau'' → 고마워요 ''gomaweoyo''), appearing to ignore vowel harmony. ㅂ is not replaced with 우 in the North (as it also was in the South before the 1988 ''Hangeul Matchumbeop''). The vowel harmony is kept in both the South and the North if the word root has only one syllable (for example, 돕다 {{IPA|[toːp̚t͈a]}} ''topta''/''dopda'').

====Indication of tensed consonants after word endings that end with ㄹ====
In word endings where the final consonant is ㄹ {{IPA|{{pipe}}l{{pipe}}}}, where the South spells -ㄹ까 {{IPA|{{pipe}}-l.k͈a{{pipe}}}} and -ㄹ쏘냐 {{IPA|{{pipe}}-l.s͈o.nja{{pipe}}}} to indicate the tensed consonants, in the North these are spelled -ㄹ가 {{IPA|{{pipe}}-l.ka{{pipe}}}}，-ㄹ소냐 {{IPA|{{pipe}}-l.so.nja{{pipe}}}} instead. These etymologically are formed by attaching to the adnominal form (관형사형 ''gwanhyeongjahyeong'') that ends in ㄹ, and in the North, the tensed consonants are denoted with normal consonants. Also, the word ending -ㄹ게 {{IPA|{{pipe}}-l.ɡe{{pipe}}}} used to be spelt -ㄹ께 {{IPA|{{pipe}}-l.k͈e{{pipe}}}} in the South, but has since been changed in the ''Hangeul Matchumbeop'' of 1988, and is now spelt -ㄹ게 just like in the North.

===Sino-Korean words===
====Initial ㄴ / ㄹ (두음법칙[{{lang|ko|頭音法則}}, ''dueum beopchik''], "initial sound rule")====
Initial ㄴ {{IPA|{{pipe}}n{{pipe}}}} / ㄹ {{IPA|{{pipe}}l{{pipe}}}} appearing in [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]] are kept in the North. In the South, in Sino-Korean words that begin with ㄹ which is followed by the vowel sound {{IPA|[i]}} or the semivowel sound {{IPA|[j]}} (when ㄹ is followed by one of ㅣ {{IPA|{{pipe}}i{{pipe}}}}, ㅑ {{IPA|{{pipe}}ja{{pipe}}}}, ㅕ {{IPA|{{pipe}}jʌ{{pipe}}}}, ㅖ {{IPA|{{pipe}}je{{pipe}}}}, ㅛ {{IPA|{{pipe}}jo{{pipe}}}} and ㅠ {{IPA|{{pipe}}ju{{pipe}}}}), ㄹ is replaced by ㅇ {{IPA|{{pipe}}∅{{pipe}}}}; when this ㄹ is followed by other vowels it is replaced by ㄴ {{IPA|{{pipe}}n{{pipe}}}}. In the North, the initial ㄹ is kept.

Similarly, in Sino-Korean words that begin with ㄴ {{IPA|{{pipe}}n{{pipe}}}} and is followed by the vowel sound {{IPA|[i]}} or the semi-vowel sound {{IPA|[j]}} (when ㄴ is followed by one of {{lang|ko|ㅣ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}i{{pipe}}}}, {{lang|ko|ㅕ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}jʌ{{pipe}}}}, {{lang|ko|ㅛ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}jo{{pipe}}}} and {{lang|ko|ㅠ}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}ju{{pipe}}}}), in the South, this ㄴ is replaced by ㅇ {{IPA|{{pipe}}∅{{pipe}}}}, but this remains unchanged in the North.

These are thus pronounced as written in the North as ㄴ {{IPA|{{pipe}}n{{pipe}}}} and ㄹ {{IPA|{{pipe}}l{{pipe}}}}. However, even in the South, sometimes in order to disambiguate the surnames 유 ({{lang|ko|柳}} ''Yu'' {{IPA|[ju]}}) and 임 ({{lang|ko|林}} ''Im'' {{IPA|[im]}}) from 유 ({{lang|ko|兪}} ''Yu'' {{IPA|[ju]}}) and 임 ({{lang|ko|任}} ''Im'' {{IPA|[im]}}), the former may be written or pronounced as 류 ''Ryu'' ({{IPA|[ɾju]}}) and 림 ''Rim'' {{lang|ko|林}} ({{IPA|[ɾim]}}).

====Hanja pronunciation====
Where a Hanja is written {{lang|ko|몌}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}mje{{pipe}}}} or {{lang|ko|폐}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}pʰje{{pipe}}}} in the South, this is written {{lang|ko|메}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}me{{pipe}}}}, {{lang|ko|페}} {{IPA|{{pipe}}pʰe{{pipe}}}} in the North (but even in the South, these are pronounced {{lang|ko|메}} {{IPA|/me/}}, {{lang|ko|페}} {{IPA|/pʰe/}}).

Also in the North, the hanja {{lang|ko|讐}} is usually pronounced as {{lang|ko|수}} ''su'' {{IPA|[su]}}, except in the word {{lang|ko|怨讐}}/원쑤 ''wŏnssu'' ("enemy"), where it is pronounced as {{lang|ko|쑤}} ''ssu'' {{IPA|[s͈u]}}. It is thought{{by whom|date=May 2012}} that this is to avoid the word becoming a [[homonym]] with {{lang|ko|元帥}} ("military general"), written as {{lang|ko|원수}} ''wŏnsu'' {{IPA|{{pipe}}wɔn.su{{pipe}}}}.

===Compound words===
====Sai siot (사이 시옷, "middle ㅅ")====
When forming compound words from uninflected words, where the so-called "sai siot" is inserted in the South: this is left out in the North, but the pronunciation is the same as in the South.

|{{lang|ko|나문닙}} {{IPA|[namunnip̚]}} ''namunnip''

|}

====Word stems in compound words====
While the general rule is to write out the word stem from which the compound word is formed in its original form, but in cases where the etymological origin is no longer remembered, this is no longer written in original form. This happens both in the North and in the South. However, whether a compound word is seen to have its etymological origin forgotten or not is seen differently by different people:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!North
!South
!Meaning
|-
|{{lang|ko|옳바르다}} {{IPA|&amp;#124;olh.pa.lɯ.ta&amp;#124;}}
|{{lang|ko|올바르다}} {{IPA|&amp;#124;ol.pa.lɯ.ta&amp;#124;}}
|upright
|-
|{{lang|ko|벗꽃}} {{IPA|&amp;#124;pɔs.k͈otɕʰ&amp;#124;}}
|{{lang|ko|벚꽃}} {{IPA|&amp;#124;pʌtɕ.k͈otɕʰ&amp;#124;}}
|cherry blossom
|}

In the first example, in the South, the {{lang|ko|올}} {{IPA|&amp;#124;ol&amp;#124;}} part shows that the etymological origin is forgotten, and the word is written as pronounced as {{lang|ko|올바르다}} {{IPA|[olbaɾɯda]}} ''olbareuda'', but in the North, the first part is seen to come from {{lang|ko|옳다}} ''olt'a'' {{IPA|&amp;#124;olh.ta&amp;#124;}} and thus the whole word is written {{lang|ko|옳바르다}} ''olbarŭda'' (pronounced the same as in the South). Conversely, in the second example, the South spelling catches the word as the combination of {{lang|ko|벚}} ''beot'' and {{lang|ko|꽃}} ''kkot'', but in the North, this is no longer recognised and thus the word is written as pronounced as {{lang|ko|벗꽃}} ''pŏtkkot''.

==Spacing==
In the South, the rules of spacing are not very clearcut, but in the North, these are very precise. In general, compared to the North, the writing in the South tends to include more spacing. One likely explanation is that the North remains closer to the Sinitic orthographical heritage, where spacing is less of an issue than with a syllabary or alphabet such as Hangul. The main differences are indicated below.

===Bound nouns===
Before bound nouns (North: 불완전명사: ''purwanjŏn myŏngsa''/{{lang|ko|不完全名詞}} "incomplete nouns"; South: 의존 명사: ''uijon myeongsa''/{{lang|ko|依存名詞}} "dependent nouns"), a space is added in the South but not in the North. This applies to counter words also, but the space is sometimes allowed to be omitted in the South.

|{{lang|ko|내것}} ''naegŏt''
|{{lang|ko|내 것}} ''nae geot''

|{{lang|ko|할 수 있다}} ''hal su ittda''
|to be able to do
|-
|{{lang|ko|한개}} ''hangae''
|{{lang|ko|한 개}} ''han gae''
|one thing (counter word)
|}

===Auxiliaries===
Before auxiliaries, a space is inserted in the South but not in the North. Depending on the situation, however, the space may be omitted in the South.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!North
!South
!Meaning
|-
|{{lang|ko|먹어보다}} ''mŏgŏboda''
|{{lang|ko|먹어 보다/먹어보다}} ''meogeo boda''/''meogeoboda''
|to try to eat
|-
|{{lang|ko|올듯하다}} ''oldŭt'ada''
|{{lang|ko|올 듯하다/올듯하다}} ''ol deutada''/''oldeutada''
|to seem to come
|-
|{{lang|ko|읽고있다}} ''ilkkoitta''

|to be reading
|-
|{{lang|ko|자고싶다}} ''chagosip'ta''
|{{lang|ko|자고 싶다}} ''jago sipda''
|to want to sleep
|}

In the above, in the rules of the South, auxiliaries coming after {{lang|ko|-아/-어}} or an adnominal form allow the space before them to be omitted, but the space after {{lang|ko|-고}} cannot be omitted.

===Words indicating a single concept===
Words formed from two or more words that indicate a single concept in principle are written with spaces in the South and without spaces in the North like [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!North
!South

|{{lang|ko|서울 대학교 인문 대학／서울대학교 인문대학}} ''Seoul Daehakgyo Inmun Daehak''/''Seouldaehakgyo Inmundaehak''
|Faculty of Humanities of Seoul National University
|}

Note that since the spacing rules in the South are often unknown, not followed, or optional, spellings vary from place to place. For example, taking the word {{lang|ko|국어 사전}} ''gugeo sajeon'', people who see this as two words will add a space, and people who see this as one word will write it without a space. Thus, the spacing depends on how one views what "one word" consists of, and so, while spacing is standardised in the South, in reality the standard does not matter much.

==Emphasis==
In the North, names of leaders '''{{lang|ko|김일성}}''' ([[Kim Il-sung]]), '''{{lang|ko|김정일}}''' ([[Kim Jong-il]]) and '''{{lang|ko|김정은}}''' ([[Kim Jong-un]]) are always set off from surrounding text, typically by bolding the characters, increasing the font size, or both.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

==Vocabulary==
The standard language in the South (표준어/{{lang|ko|標準語}} ''pyojuneo'') is largely based on the Seoul dialect, and the standard language (문화어/{{lang|ko|文化語}} ''munhwaŏ'') in the North is largely based on the Pyongyang dialect. However, both in the North and in the South, the vocabulary and forms of the standard language come from ''Sajeonghan Joseoneo Pyojunmal Mo-eum'' 사정한 조선어 표준말 모음 published by the Korean Language Society in 1936, and so there is very little difference in the basic vocabulary between the standard languages used in the North and the South. Nevertheless, due to the difference in political systems and social structure, each country is constantly adding different words to its vocabulary.

===Differences due to the difference in political system or social structure===

|{{lang|ko|친구 (親舊)}} ''chingu''
|Friend
|}

The word {{lang|ko|동무}} ''tongmu''/''dongmu'' that is used to mean "friend" in the North was originally used across the whole of Korea, but after the division of Korea, North Korea began to use it as a translation of the [[Russian language|Russian]] term товарищ (friend, [[comrade]]), and since then, the word has come to mean "comrade" in the South as well and has fallen out of use there.

===Differences in words of foreign origin===
South Korea has borrowed a lot of English words, but North Korea has borrowed a number of Russian words, and there are numerous differences in words used between the two coming from these different borrowings.&lt;ref name="BärtåsEkman2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bärtås|first1=Magnus|last2=Ekman|first2=Fredrik|title=Hirviöidenkin on kuoltava: Ryhmämatka Pohjois-Koreaan|year=2014|publisher=Tammi|location=Helsinki|language=fi|isbn=978-951-31-7727-0|pages=64–65|trans-title=All Monsters Must Die: An Excursion to North Korea|translator-last=Eskelinen|translator-first=Heikki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strother|first1=Jason|title=Korean Is Virtually Two Languages, and that's a Big Problem for North Korean Defectors|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-05-19/korean-today-virtually-two-languages-and-thats-problem-north-korean-defectors|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=PRI|date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the same English word is borrowed, how this word is transliterated into Korean may differ between the North and the South, resulting in different words being adapted into the corresponding standard languages. For names of other nations and their places, the principle is to base the transliteration on the English word in the South and to base the transliteration on the word in the original language in the North.

===Other differences in vocabulary===
The other differences between the standard languages in the North and in the South are thought to be caused by the differences between the Seoul and Pyongyang dialects.

Words like {{lang|ko|강냉이}} ''gangnaeng-i'' and {{lang|ko|우}} ''u'' are also sometimes heard in various dialects in South Korea.

There are also some words that exist only in the North. The verb {{lang|ko|마스다}} ''masŭda'' (to break) and its passive form {{lang|ko|마사지다}} ''masajida'' (to be broken) have no exactly corresponding words in the South.

==Problems ==
During the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the two Korean countries decided to play jointly for the [[Korea women's national ice hockey team]]. This led to issues with the South Korean athletes communicating with the North Korean athletes since the former uses English-influenced words in their postwar vocabulary, especially for hockey, while the latter uses only Korean-inspired words for their postwar vocabulary.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siles|first1=Matt|title=Koreas' unified women's hockey team has exposed a key difference between South and North — their language|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-koreas-hockey-language-2018-story.html|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language differences also pose challenges for researchers and for the tens of thousands of people who have defected from the North to the South since the Korean War. The defectors face difficulty because they lack vocabulary, use differing accents, or have not [[culturally assimilated]] yet so may not understand jokes or references to [[pop culture]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

[[File:Dialectos español de Perú.png|thumb|300x300px|Dialect map of [[Peru]] (in Spanish)]]
'''Peruvian Spanish''' is a family of  dialects of the [[Spanish language]] that have been spoken in Peru since 1532. There are four varieties spoken in the country, by about 80% of the population.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The four Peruvian dialects are [[Andean Spanish]]; [[Peruvian Coast Spanish]]; Andean-Costal Spanish or ''neolimeño;'' and [[Amazonic Spanish]].

==History==
The Spanish language first arrived in what today is [[Peru]] in 1532. During colonial and early republican times, the Spanish spoken colloquially in the coast and in the cities of the highland possessed strong local features, but as a result of dialect leveling in favor of the standard language, the language of urban Peruvians today is more or less uniform in pronunciation throughout most of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garatea Grau|first=Carlos|title=Tras una lengua de Papel. El español del Perú|year=2010|publisher=Fondo Editorial Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú|location=Lima|isbn=978-9972-42-923-1|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vestiges of the older dialect of the coast can be found in the speech of  [[Afro-Peruvians|black Peruvians]], which retains Andalusian features such as the aspiration or deletion of final /s/ and the deletion of final /r/. The dialect of Arequipa, [[Loncco]], in its pure form is now extinct, although some elders are familiar with it.

Throughout most of the highland, [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] continued to be the language of the majority until the mid 20th century. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miranda Esquerre|first=Luis|title=La entrada del español en el Perú|year=1998|publisher=Juan Brito/ Editor|location=Lima|isbn=9972-702-00-6|pages=101, 111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass migration (rural exodus) into Lima starting in the 1940s, and into other major cities  and regional capitals later on, accompanied by discrimination and the growth of mass media, have reconfigured the linguistic demography of the country in favor of Spanish. The poor urban masses originating in this migration adopted the standardized dialect spoken in the cities, however with traces of Andean pronunciation and a simplified syntax.

==Peruvian dialects==

===Andean Spanish===
{{Main|Andean Spanish}}
Andean Spanish the most common dialect in the Andes (more marked in rural areas) and has many similarities with the "standard" dialect of [[Ecuador]] and [[Bolivia]].

==== Principal characteristics ====
The phonology of Andean Peruvian Spanish is distinguished by its slow time and unique rhythm ([[grave accent]]), [[assibilation]] of {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, and an apparent confusion of the vowels {{IPA|/e/}} with {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} with {{IPA|/u/}}. (In reality, they are producing a sound between /e/ and /i/, and between /o/ and /u/.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jorge Pérez et al.]], ''Contra el prejuico lingüístico de la motosidad: un estudio de las vocales del castellano andino desde la fonética acústica'', Lima: Instituto Riva Agüero. PUCP, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) Furthermore, the "s" (originally apical and without aspiration) is produced with more force than that of the coast; this is also generally true of the other consonants, at the loss of the vowels. Other distinctive features are the preservation of {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, sometimes hypercorrective realization of {{IPA|/ʝ/}} as {{IPA|[ʎ]}}, and the realization of velar plosives as a fricative {{IPA|[x]}}.

The [[morphosyntactic]] characteristics are typical:

*Confusion or unification of gender and number
:'''''A ellas lo recibí bien.'''''. '''''La revista es caro.'''''

*Confusion or unification of gender and number
:'''''esa es su trenza del carlos.'''''

*Overuse of the diminutives –ito e –ita
:'''''Vente aquicito.'''''. '''''Sí, señorita, ahí están sus hijos.'''''

*[[Loísmo]]
:'''''Lo echan la agua'''''. '''''Lo pintan la casa'''''

*Duplication of the possessives and objects
:'''''Su casa de Pepe.'''. '''Lo conozco a ella.'''''

*The absence or redundant use of articles
:'''''Plaza de Armas es acá. La María está loca.'''''

*Uncommon use of the preposition "en" in front of [[locative adverb]]s
:'''''Todo caerá en su encima'''''

* The use of "no más" and "pues" after the verb
:'''''Dile nomás pues.'''''

* The use of the verb at the end of the phrase
:'''''Está enojada dice.'''''

*The use of the simple tense to express the preterite and of the indicative in place of the subjunctive in subordinates.

===Peruvian coast Spanish===
{{Main|Peruvian Coast Spanish}}
Coastal Spanish is spoken throughout the coast. It has the reputation (in pronunciation) of being one of the "purest" dialects in all of coastal Latin America because it does not debuccalize {{IPA|/s/}} between vowels{{fix|text=is "in syllable coda" what is meant?|date=June 2015}} and retains the fricatives {{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[χ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cerrón Palomino|first=Rodolfo|title=Castellano Andino Aspectos sociolingüísticos, pedagógicos y gramaticales|year=2003|publisher=Fondo Editorial Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú y GTZ Cooperación Técnica Alemana|location=Lima|isbn=9972-42-528-2|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tadeo Hanke]], ''Carácter, genio y costumbres de los limeños, 1801'', Concejo Provincial de Lima, 1959, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rafael Lapesa]], ''Historia de la lengua española'', Editorial Gredos, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; It is the characteristic dialect as perceived abroad and has the reputation of being the base of "normal" or [[standard language|standard]] Peruvian Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hildebrandt |first=Martha |title=El habla culta (o lo que debiera serlo)|year=2003|publisher=|location=Lima|isbn=9972-9454-1-3|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Characteristics====
*The vowels are stable and clear.
*{{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}} are pronounced clearly, without any fricativization.
*{{IPA|/s/}} is more often laminal than apical, and debuccalized to {{IPAblink|h}} in front of most consonants (though it is {{IPAblink|x}} before {{IPA|/k/}}). It is retained as {{IPA|[s]}} in final position (as opposed to in [[Chile]] or [[Andalucia]]).
*{{IPA|/x/}} varies between {{IPA|[x]}}, {{IPAblink|χ}}, and {{IPAblink|ç}} (preceded by [e] and [i]); it is sometimes {{IPA|[h]}}.
*Word-final nasals are [[velar consonant|velar]] (not alveolar like in [[Mexico]] or central Spain).
*The final {{IPA|/d/}} is normally [[Elision|elided]], but sometimes devoiced as {{IPAblink|t}} in formal speech.
*[[Yeísmo]] exists, the phoneme occurring as {{IPAblink|ʝ}} and {{IPAblink|j}} interchangeably, and as palato-alveolar {{IPA|[dʒ]}} in initial position by some speakers.
* The tendency to eliminate [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] in word with an ''-ear'' suffix.

General Spanish phrases from the Americas are common but there are also phrases that originate in the Lima coastal area, such as frequent traditional terms and expressions; the most ingrained [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas#Words from Quechua|"quechuaism"]] in common speech is the familiar ''calato'', meaning "naked".

=== Andean-Costal Spanish or ''neolimeño'' ===
Born in the most recent 30–50 years with a mixture of the speech of Andean migrants and the speech of Lima. This dialect is the speech that is most typical of Peru.

This dialect has the usual Andean [[syntactics]], like lack of agreement in gender and number, the frequent use of [[diminutive]]s or [[augmentative]]s, loísmo, double possessives and ending phrases with "''pues''", "''pe''" or "''pue''".

As far as the lexicon is concerned, there are numerous neologisms, influences from Quechua, and slang among the youth often heard in the streets.

=== Amazonic Spanish ===
{{Main|Amazonic Spanish}}
This dialect has developed uniquely, with contact from Andean Spanish and the Spanish of Lima with the [[Amazonian languages]].  It has a distinctive tonal structure.

Phonetically it is characterized by:
*The sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} resisting aspiration
*A confusion of {{IPA|/x/}} with {{IPA|/f/}} (always bilabial)
:For example, ''San Juan'' becomes ''San Fan''
* There is [[Occlusive|occlusion]] of the intervals {{IPA|/b, d, g/}} in tonal ascension with aspiration and lengthening of the vowels.
*{{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are pronounced with aspiration
*The {{IPA|/ʝ/}} tends to become an affricate (as opposed to Coastal Peruvian Spanish)
*Also, there is assibilation and weak [[Trill consonant|trills]].

On the other hand, the syntactic order most recognized is the prefixation of the genitive:
:''De Antonio sus amigas''

There are also disorders of agreement, gender, etc.

=== Equatorial Spanish ===
{{Main|Equatorial Spanish}}
This dialect is spoken in the region of [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]].

'''Romagnol''' (also known as ''Rumagnol'') is a group of closely related dialects of the [[Emilian-Romagnol language]] spoken in the historical region of [[Romagna]], which is today in the south-eastern part of [[Emilia-Romagna]]. The name itself is derived from the Lombard name for the region ''Romania''.&lt;ref&gt;Larner, J. (1965).The Lords of Romagna: Romagnol Society and the Origins of the Signorie. Ithaca: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also spoken outside the region, particularly in the neighboring province of [[Province of Pesaro and Urbino|Pesaro-Urbino]] (part of the [[Marche]] region) and in the independent country of [[San Marino]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Grementieri, S. (2012, January 7). The Romagnolo Dialect: A Short Study On its History, Grammar, and How it Survives [Scholarly project]. In www.dialettoromagnolo.it. Retrieved March 4, 2017, from http://www.dialettoromagnolo.it/uploads/5/2/4/2/52420601/pb-241-file-grementieri_the_romagnolo_dialect.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is classified as a threatened language, due to older generations having “neglected to pass on the dialect as a native tongue to the next generation”.&lt;ref&gt;Cenni, I. (2013). Code-switching as an indicator of language shift: a case study of the Romagnolo dialect of Gatteo a Mare, Italy. 46th International Annual Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea, Abstracts. Presented at the 46th International Annual Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
While contemporaneous with modern Standard Italian, it is technically a member of the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic branch]] and more comparable to the “northern group” of Italian dialects.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Gregor, D. B. (1972). Romagnol Language and Literature. Stoughton Harrow: Oleander Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the dialects [[Emilian dialect|Emilian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], and [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]]. It is sometimes considered a subdialect of a larger Emilian-Romagnol language, which encompasses a broad continuum of dialects spanning the region of [[Emilia-Romagna]].

==Geographic distribution==
=== Western border ===
West of [[Romagna]], the [[Emilian language]] is spoken. The border with Emilian-speaking areas is the Sillaro river, which runs 25&amp;nbsp;km east from [[Bologna]] to the west of ([[Castel San Pietro Terme]]). Emilian is spoken, to the east, in [[Imola]], the language is Romagnol. In [[Emilia-Romagna]], Emilian is spoken in all the rest of the region moving from the Sillaro river to the west, up to [[Piacenza]].

=== Northern border ===
The [[Reno River]] is the border between Romagnol and the dialect of Ferrara. Romagnol is spoken also in some villages northwards of the Reno River, such as [[Argenta, Emilia–Romagna]] and Filo, where people of Romagnol origin live alongside people of Ferrarese origin. [[Ferrara]] goes into Emilian language territory.

=== Southern border ===
Outside Emilia-Romagna, Romagnol is spoken in the Republic of [[San Marino]] ("Sammarinese"), in the Marecchia Valley, in the Conca Valley ([[Montefeltro]]) and in all of the [[Pesaro e Urbino]] province.

==History==
Romagnol's first acknowledgement outside regional literature was in Dante Alighieri’s treatise ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', wherein [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] compares “the language of Romagna” to his native [[Tuscan dialect]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Alighieri, D. (1996). Dante: De vulgari eloquentia (S. Botterill, Trans.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in 1629, the author [[Adriano Banchieri]] wrote the treatise ''Discorso della lingua Bolognese'', which countered Dante’s claim that the Tuscan dialect was better, arguing his belief that Bolognese (a subdialect of Romagnol that saw wide use in writing) was superior in “naturalness, softness, musicality, and usefulness.” Romagnol received more recognition after Romagna gained independence from the [[Papal States]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Haller, H. W. (1999). The Other Italy: The Literary Canon in Dialect (Toronto Italian Studies). University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a large repertoire of folklore legends, myths, and fables in Romagnol, due to its role in local geopolitical history (e.g. Caesar crossing the [[Rubicon]] and [[Theoderic the Great|Theodoric’s]] conquest and subsequent rule of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]). Romagna’s geographic diversity was home to a variety of lifestyles and trade backgrounds, such as “the mountaineers of the Alps, the fisherman of the Adriatic, the farmers of the plains, and the city folk,” which in turn, allowed for a large range of topics and themes present in the literature. Darker themes, such as poverty and pessimism, are also known to be common subjects of Romagnol poetry, fables, and prose.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Citroni, M. C. (1997). Leggende e racconti dell'Emiglia Romagna (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===

==== 16th to 19th century ====
The first appearance of a distinct Romagnol literary work  is "Sonetto romagnolo" by [[Bernardino Gatti|Bernardino Catti]], from [[Ravenna]], printed 1502. It is written in a mixture of [[Italian language|Italian]] and Romagnol{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}.

The first Romagnol [[poem]] dates back to the end of 16th century: ''E Pvlon matt. Cantlena aroica'' (Mad Nap), a [[mock-heroic]] poem based on [[Orlando Furioso]] and written by an anonymous author from {{Interlanguage link multi|San Vittore di Cesena|it|San Vittore (Cesena)}}. The original poem comprised twelve cantos, of which only the first four survived (1848 lines).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first Romagnol poet to win fame was the [[Clergy|cleric]] Pietro Santoni, ([[Fusignano]], 1736–1823). He was the teacher of [[Vincenzo Monti]], one of the most famous Italian poets of his time.

In 1840 the first Romagnol-Italian Dictionary was published by {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Morri|it}}, printed in [[Faenza]].

==== 20th century ====&lt;!-- Please respect alphabetical order --&gt;
The 20th century saw a flourishing of Romagnol literature. Theatrical plays, poems and books of a high quality were produced. Some of the best known Romagnol authors are:
* [[Raffaello Baldini]], who won in 1988 the "Premio Viareggio" and in 1995 the "Premio Bagutta," known for long pessimistic poems and prose&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* [[Tonino Guerra]] (1920–2012), wrote poems during his exile to WWII-era Germany, focusing on people of suffering and poverty&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* [[Olindo Guerrini]], with "Sonetti romagnoli" {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Aldo Spallicci|it}}, an antifascist exiled from Romagna. He wrote poems such as "Rumâgna" that were often descriptive of Romagna&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Grammar==
===Morphology===

Unlike Standard Italian, not all nouns end in a theme vowel. Masculine nouns lack theme vowels and feminine nouns typically (but not always) terminate in "a." To form plurals, masculine nouns and adjectives undergo lexically-specified [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]. In the case of feminine nouns and adjectives, "a" becomes "i" or deletes if after a consonant cluster or double consonant.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Syntax===
Italian and Romagnol share much of the same features when it comes to verbs. Both languages are SVO in simple sentences. Verbs are conjugated according to [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense, mood, and person]]. Romagnol also has 4 conjugations compared to Italian's 3: the 1st, êr; the 2nd, -ér; the 3rd, -ar; and the 4th, -ìr.  One marked difference in syntax between Romagnol and Italian is that pronouns are obligatory, and some verbs in Romagnol use a [[Reflexive verb|reflexive construction]] (even if the speaker is not the second argument of the verb) where Italian uses an [[Intransitive verb|intransitive construction]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pelliciardi, F.

|-

|I am
|-
|Mè a j'ò
|(Io) ho
|I have
|}
Verbs that are [[Impersonal verb|impersonal]] (lacking a canonical subject) in Romagnol use "avèr," in contrast with Italian which uses "essere." Even though the subject is null, an expletive pronoun inserts itself in the specifier position, much like English's "it". 
* Italian: '''è''' piovuto, ''It rained''
* Romagnol: '''l'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'à piuvù, ''It rained''
Additionally, whereas Standard Italian and other Northern dialects omit the definite article before “singular names and names of relatives,” Romagnol does not do so.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ledgeway, A., &amp; Maiden, M. (Eds.). (2016).The Oxford Guide to the Romance Languages(1st ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
Romagnol has [[Lexical similarity|lexical]] and [[syntactic]] uniformity throughout its area. However, its [[pronunciation]] changes as one goes from the [[Po Valley]] to the hills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Syllable structure===
Some words that in Latin were [[trisyllabic]] or tetrasyllabic (where ''u'' is not [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]]) are reduced in Romagnol to [[Monosyllabic|monosyllables]]. The atonic [[Syllable|syllable(s)]] is/are cut off.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Vowels===
Romagnol, has an inventory of up to 20 [[contrast (phonology)|contrast]]ive vowels in stressed position (in comparison to Italian's 7), which are marked in orthography using diacritics on a, i, o, u,  and e.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Vitali, D. (2008). L'ortografia romangnola [Scholarly project]. In www.dialettoromagnolo.it. Retrieved March 5, 2017, from http://www.dialettoromagnolo.it/uploads/5/2/4/2/52420601/pb-233-file-ortografiaromagnola.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of an official institution regulating its ortography leads in many cases to ambiguities in the transcription of vowel sounds.

The following table has the [[nasal vowel]]s, [[oral vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s in the northern (around [[Lugo, Emilia-Romagna|Lugo]]) variety of Romagnol:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Romagnol, in addition to its larger inventory of vowels, also has more consonants compared to standard Italian. Additionally, consonants bear the following differences compared to Standard Italian:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
* In central dialects, word-final ''n'' is deleted and the preceding vowel is nasalized, as shown above.
* Consonants are doubled in [[consonant length|length]] after a closed vowel. 
* {{IPA|/dʒ/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (often non-sibilants {{IPAblink|dð̠}} and {{IPAblink|tθ̠}}) can occur word-finally, and are usually distinguished by the lack or presence of an ''h'' in orthography.
* In subdialects that have the dental fricatives {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}}, voicing is contrastive.
* In younger speakers {{IPA|/ʂ/}} and {{IPA|/ʐ/}} are sometimes realized as {{IPAblink|s}} and {{IPAblink|z}}, out of italian influence.

'''Shilluk''' (natively ''Dhøg Cøllø'' or ''d̪ɔ́cɔ̀llɔ̀'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openroad.net.au/languages/chollo|title=Chollo (Dhøg Cøllø)|work=openroad.net.au|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Luo languages|Luo language]] spoken by the [[Shilluk people]] of [[South Sudan]] and [[Sudan]]. It is closely related to other Luo and [[Nilotic peoples]]' languages. The term Shilluk is a pronunciation of [[Arabic]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_work.asp?id=92847458920|title=An autosegmental approach to Shilluk phonology|last=Gilley|first=Leoma G.|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=0-88312-106-9|editor-last=[[Summer Institute of Linguistics]]|location=Dallas, Texas|pages=214|type=revised text of a thesis, University of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these vowels also exists in a long form and an overlong form which are [[phonemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Cynthia L.|last2=Gilley|first2=Leoma G.|date=2001|title=Evidence for ergativity in Shilluk|url=|journal=Journal of African languages and linguistics|volume=22|issue=1|pages=33–68|via=|doi=10.1515/jall.22.1.33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Remijsen|first=Bert|last2=Ayoker|first2=Otto G.|last3=Mills|first3=Timothy|date=2011|title=Illustrations of the IPA – Shilluk|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0025100310000289|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|volume=41|issue=1|pages=|via=|doi=10.1017/s0025100310000289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Advanced and retracted tongue root ====
Shilluk, like most Nilotic languages, differentiates vowels according to their place of articulation. They are either pronounced with [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|advancement of the root of the tongue]] or with retraction of the root of the tongue. Gilley uses the terms "extended larynx" or "blown vowel".

The vowels with advancement of the root of the tongue are {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|[o]}}, {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, {{IPA|[a]}} and their corresponding long variants. The vowels with retraction of the root of the language are denoted by a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] below the letter: {{IPA|[i̠]}}, {{IPA|[e̠]}}, {{IPA|[o̠]}}, {{IPA|[ɔ̠]}}, {{IPA|[u̠]}} and {{IPA|[a̠]}} and their corresponding long variants.

=== Tone ===
Shilluk has a rich inventory of [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], with at least seven distinctive tone patterns or tonemes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three level tonemes: Low, Mid and High. In addition, there are four contours – the Rise and three falling configurations: Fall, High Fall and Late Fall. These are denoted by the following diacritics:
{| class="wikitable"

|-
|Late Falling
|'''´`''' (acute accent followed by grave accent)
|}

== Morphology ==

=== Syllable structure ===
Uninflected native stem [[syllables]] are overwhelmingly monosyllabic. With few exceptions, these monosyllabic stems typically consist of an onset, a vowel (nucleus), and a coda. Their structure is as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

C (Cj/w) V (V) (V) C

The monosyllabic stems give rise to polysyllabic words through processes of [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] or [[inflection]]. For verbs and nouns alike, the most common prefixes are /a- ʊ-/, and the most common suffixes are /-Cɪ -ɪ -a (-ɔ)/.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Orthography ==
A [[Latin script|Latin]] alphabet was developed for Shilluk by [[Christian mission]]aries in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/shilluk.htm|title=Shilluk language and pronunciation|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 29 characters in Shilluk orthography; 10 vowels and 19 consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shilluk.webonary.org/overview/alphabet/|title=Cøllø (aka Shilluk) Dictionary » Alphabet|website=shilluk.webonary.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, sports teams and the people who play sports have been [[amateur sports|amateurs]].

Team identities can be formed from a number of sources, most often a type of geographic location, e.g., the [[Dallas Cowboys]] are named after [[Dallas]], Texas, US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallascowboys.com/|title=Dallas Cowboys {{!}} Official Site of the Dallas Cowboys|website=www.dallascowboys.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teams can also be named after an institution, such as the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]], which are supported by and named after the [[University of Alabama]], or the [[Yomiuri Giants]], who are named after the [[Yomiuri Group]], a Japanese media conglomerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://info.yomiuri.co.jp/english/about.html|title=About the Yomiuri Shimbun Group ： Corporate Profile of The Yomiuri Shimbun|website=Corporate Profile of The Yomiuri Shimbun|language=ja|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1351">A '''spot beam''', in [[telecommunications]] parlance, is a [[satellite]] signal that is specially concentrated in [[Power (physics)|power]] (i.e. sent by a [[high-gain antenna]]) so that it will cover only a limited geographic area on Earth. Spot beams are used so that only [[earth station]]s in a particular intended reception area can properly receive the satellite signal.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael Olorunfunmi|last= Kolawole|title=Satellite Communication Engineering, Second Edition|publisher =[[CRC Press]] |year=2013 |page=43 |isbn=9781138075351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable example of the use of spot beams is on [[direct broadcast satellite]] systems such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] that deliver local [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television]] via satellite only to viewers in the part of [[North America]] from which those terrestrial broadcast stations originate.

Spot beams allow satellites to transmit different data signals using the same frequency. Because satellites have a limited number of frequencies to use, the ability to re-use a frequency for different geographical locations (without different data interfering with each other at the receiver) allows for more local channels to be carried, since the same frequency can be used in several regions.

[[File:AustroAsiatic tree Peiros2004.png|thumb|350px|Austro-Asiatic language tree]]
[[File:Tree of maya languages.svg|thumb|350px|Maya language tree]]

In [[historical linguistics]], the '''tree model''' (also '''Stammbaum''', '''genetic''', or '''cladistic model''') is a model of the evolution of languages analogous to the concept of a [[family tree]], particularly a [[phylogenetic tree]] in the [[biological evolution]] of [[species]].  As with species, each language is assumed to have evolved from a single parent or "mother" language, with languages that share a common ancestor belonging to the same [[language family]].

Popularized by the German linguist [[August Schleicher]] in 1853,&lt;ref name="ListNelson-Sathi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=List|first1=Johann-Mattis|last2=Nelson-Sathi|first2=Shijulal|last3=Geisler|first3=Hans|last4=Martin|first4=William|title=Networks of lexical borrowing and lateral gene transfer in language and genome evolution|journal=BioEssays|volume=36|issue=2|year=2014|pages=141–150|issn=0265-9247|doi=10.1002/bies.201300096|pmid=24375688|pmc=3910147}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tree model has always been a common method of describing [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]]s between languages since the first attempts to do so.  It is central to the field of [[comparative linguistics]], which involves using evidence from known languages and observed rules of language feature evolution to identify and describe the hypothetical [[proto-language]]s ancestral to each language family, such as [[Proto-Indo-European]] and the [[Indo-European languages]].  However, this is largely a theoretical, qualitative pursuit, and linguists have always emphasized the inherent limitations of the tree model due to the large role played by [[horizontal gene transmission|horizontal transmission]] in language evolution, ranging from [[loanword]]s to [[creole language]]s that have multiple mother languages.&lt;ref name="ListNelson-Sathi2014"/&gt;  The [[wave model]] was developed in 1872 by Schleicher's student [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]] as an alternative to the tree model that incorporates horizontal transmission.

The tree model also has the same limitations as biological taxonomy with respect to the [[species problem]] of [[Quantization (disambiguation)|quantizing]]&lt;!--no disambiguation needed--&gt; a continuous phenomenon that includes exceptions like [[ring species]] in biology and [[dialect continua]] in language.  The concept of a [[linkage (linguistics)|linkage]] was developed in response and refers to a group of languages that evolved from a dialect continuum rather than from linguistically isolated child languages of a single language.

==History of the model==

===The confusion of Babel===
[[File:Genealogy shem.gif|thumb|left|Family tree of Biblical tribes]]

[[Augustine of Hippo]] supposed that each of the descendants of [[Noah]] founded a nation and that each nation was given its own language: [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] for [[Assur]], [[Hebrew]] for [[Eber|Heber]], and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Saint Augustine|title=City of God|chapter=XVI: 9-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all he identified 72 nations, tribal founders and languages. The confusion and dispersion occurred in the time of [[Peleg]], son of Heber, son of [[Shem]], son of Noah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Chronicles]] 1:19.&lt;/ref&gt;
Augustine then makes a [[hypothesis]] not unlike those of later historical linguists, that the family of Heber "preserved that language not unreasonably believed to have been the common language of the race ... thenceforth named Hebrew." Most of the 72 languages, however, date to many generations after Heber. St. Augustine solves this first problem by supposing that Heber, who lived 430 years, was still alive when God assigned the 72.&lt;ref name="augustine"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saint Augustine (Bishop of Hippo.)|title=The Works of Aurelius Augustine: A New Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvwXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA123|year=1871|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|123}}

===Ursprache, the language of paradise===
St. Augustine's hypothesis stood without major question for over a thousand years. Then, in a series of tracts, published in 1684, expressing skepticism concerning various beliefs, especially Biblical, Sir [[Thomas Browne]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1684|pp=223–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Though the earth were widely peopled before the flood ... yet whether, after a large dispersion, and the space of sixteen hundred years, men maintained so uniform a language in all parts, ... may very well be doubted."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Folio 25v - The Garden of Eden.jpg|thumb|left|Garden of Eden, home of the Ursprache]]

By then, discovery of the [[New World]] and exploration of the [[Far East]] had brought knowledge of numbers of new languages far beyond the 72 calculated by St. Augustine. Citing the Native American languages, Browne suggests the "confusion of tongues at first fell only upon those present in Sinaar at the work of Babel ...." For those "about the foot of the hills, whereabout the ark rested ... their primitive language might in time branch out into several parts of Europe and {{nowrap|Asia ...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1684|p=224}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}} This is an inkling of a tree. In Browne's view, simplification from a larger aboriginal language than Hebrew could account for the differences in language. He suggests ancient Chinese, from which the others descended by "confusion, admixtion and corruption".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1684|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he invokes "commixture and alteration."&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Browne|1684|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Browne reports a number of reconstructive activities by the scholars of the times:&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Browne|1684|pp=226–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The learned [[Méric Casaubon|Casaubon]] conceiveth that a dialogue might be composed in Saxon, only of such words as are derivable from the Greek ... [[Richard Rowlands|Verstegan]] made no doubt that he could contrive a letter that might be understood by the English, Dutch, and East Frislander ... And if, as the learned [[Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn|Buxhornius]] contendeth, the Scythian language as the mother tongue runs throughout the nations of Europe, and even as far as Persia, the community on many words, between so many nations, hath more reasonable traduction and were rather derivable from the common tongue diffused through them all, than from any particular nation, which hath also borrowed and holdeth but at second hand."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The confusion at the Tower of Babel was thus removed as an obstacle by setting it aside. Attempts to find similarities in all languages were resulting in the gradual uncovering of an ancient master language from which all the other languages derive. Browne undoubtedly did his writing and thinking well before 1684. In that same revolutionary century in Britain [[James Howell]] published {{nowrap|Volume II}} of ''[[Epistolae Ho-Elianae]]'', quasi-fictional letters to various important persons in the realm containing valid historical information. In Letter LVIII the metaphor of a tree of languages appears fully developed short of being a professional linguist's view:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James|last=Howell|title=Epistolae Ho-Elianae, Familiar Letters, Domestic and Forren, Divided into Four Books, Partly Historical, Political, Philosophical, Upon Emergent Occasions|volume=Volume II|edition=6th
|year=1688|origyear=1645|publisher=Thomas Guy|location=London
|chapter=Letter LVIII To the Right Honourable the Earl R.|page=356}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I will now hoist sail for the Netherlands, whose language is the same dialect with the English, and was so from the beginning, being both of them derived from the high Dutch [Howell is wrong here]: The Danish also is but a branch of the same tree ... Now the High Dutch or Teutonick Tongue, is one of the prime and most spacious Maternal Languages of Europe ... it was the language of the [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]], and continueth yet of the greatest part of [[Poland]] and [[Hungary]], who have a Dialect of hers for their vulgar tongue ... Some of her writers would make this world believe that she was the language spoken in paradise."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The search for "the language of paradise" was on among all the linguists of Europe. Those who wrote in Latin called it the ''lingua prima'', the ''lingua primaeva'' or the ''lingua primigenia.'' In English it was the Adamic language; in German, the ''Ursprache'' or the ''hebräische Ursprache'' if one believed it was Hebrew. This mysterious language had the aura of purity and incorruption about it, and those qualities were the standards used to select candidates. This concept of ''Ursprache'' came into in use well before the [[neo-grammarian]]s adopted it for their proto-languages. The gap between the widely divergent families of languages remained unclosed.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===The first Indo-Europeanists===
[[File:Steppe of western Kazakhstan in the early spring.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed homeland of the Indo-Europeans, western Kazakhstan]]
On February 2, 1786, Sir [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] delivered his ''Third Anniversary Discourse'' to the [[Asiatic Society]] as its president on the topic of the [[Hindus]]. In it he applied the logic of the tree model to three languages, Greek, Latin and Sanskrit, but for the first time in history on purely linguistic grounds, noting "a stronger affinity, both in the roots of the verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; ...." He went on to postulate that they sprang from "some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists." To them he added Gothic, Celtic and Persian as "to the same family."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=William|last=Jones|contribution=Third Anniversary Discourse, on the Hindus|title=The Works of Sir William Jones with the life of the Author, in Thirteen Volumes|editor=Lord Teignmouth|location=London|publisher=
John Stockdale and John Walker|year=1807|origyear=1786|volume=Volume III|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones did not name his "common source" nor develop the idea further, but it was taken up by the linguists of the times. In the ''(London) Quarterly Review'' of late 1813-1814, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] published a review of [[Johann Christoph Adelung]]'s ''Mithridates, oder allgemeine Sprachenkunde'' ("Mithridates, or a General History of Languages"), Volume I of which had come out in 1806, and Volumes II and III, {{nowrap|1809-1812}}, continued by Johann Severin Vater. Adelung's work described some 500 "languages and dialects" and hypothesized a universal descent from the language of paradise, located in [[Kashmir]] central to the total range of the 500. Young begins by pointing out Adelung's indebtedness to [[Conrad Gesner]]'s ''Mithridates, de Differentiis Linguarum'' of 1555 and other subsequent catalogues of languages and {{nowrap|alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1813|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Kashmir-india.png|thumb|Kashmir (red), Adelung's location of Eden.]]
Young undertakes to present Adelung's classification. The [[Monosyllabic language|monosyllabic]] type is most ancient and primitive, spoken in Asia, to the east of Eden, in the direction of Adam's exit from Eden. Then follows Jones' group, still without a name, but attributed to Jones: "Another ancient and extensive class of languages united by a greater number of resemblances than can well be altogether accidental." For this class he offers a name,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Young|1813|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Indoeuropean," the first known linguistic use of the word, but not its first known use. The [[British East India Company]] was using "Indo-European commerce" to mean the trade of commodities between India and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A sketch of the history of the East-India company, from its first formation to the passing of the Regulating act of 1773; with a summary view of the changes that have taken place since that period in the internal administration of British India|first=Robert |last=Grant|publisher=Black, Parry, and Co. [etc.]|location=London|year=1813|pages=xxxiv-xxxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the evidence Young cites for the ancestral group are the most similar words: mother, father, etc.

Adelung's additional classes were the Tataric, the African and the American, which depend on geography and a presumed descent from Eden. Young does not share Adelung's enthusiasm for the language of paradise, and brands it as mainly speculative.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Young's designation, successful in English, was only one of several candidates proposed between 1810 and 1867: indo-germanique ([[Conrad Malte-Brun]], 1810), japetisk ([[Rasmus Christian Rask]], 1815), Indo-Germanisch ([[Julius Klaproth]], 1823), indisch-teutsch (F. Schmitthenner, 1826), sanskritisch ([[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], 1827), indokeltisch (A. F. Pott, 1840), arioeuropeo ([[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]], 1854), Aryan ([[Max Müller]], 1861) and aryaque (H. Chavée, 1867). These men were all polyglots and prodigies in languages. Klaproth, author of the successful German-language candidate, Indo-Germanisch, who criticised Jones for his uncritical method, knew Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan and a number of other languages with their scripts. The concept of a Biblical Ursprache appealed to their imagination. As hope of finding it gradually died they fell back on the growing concept of common Indo-European spoken by nomadic tribes on the plains of Eurasia, and although they made a good case that this language can be deduced by the methods of comparative linguistics, in fact that is not how they obtained it. It was the one case in which their efforts to find the Ursprache succeeded.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===The neogrammarians===
The model is due in its most strict formulation to the [[Neogrammarian]]s. The model relies on earlier conceptions of [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], [[Franz Bopp]] and [[August Schleicher]] by adding the exceptionlessness of the [[sound laws]] and the regularity of the process. The linguist perhaps most responsible for establishing the link to Darwinism was August Schleicher.[[File:Schleicher Tree.jpg|thumb|left|Schleicher's tree model]] That he was comparing his ''Stammbaum'', or family tree of languages, to Darwin's presentation of evolution shortly after that presentation, is proved by the open letter he wrote in 1863 to [[Ernst Haeckel]], published posthumously, however. In 1869, Haeckel had suggested he read ''Origin of Species''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After reading it Schleicher wrote ''Die Darwinische Theorie und die Sprachwissenschaft'', "Darwinism tested by the Science of Language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Foundations of systematics and biogeography | author=D M Williams, D.M. |author2=Malte C Ebach |author3=Gareth J Nelson  | location=New York, NY | publisher=Springer | year=2008 | page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a scenario reminiscent of that between Darwin and Wallace over the discovery of evolution (both discovered it independently), Schleicher endorsed Darwin's presentation, but criticised it for not inserting any species. He then presented a ''Stammbaum'' of languages, which, however, was not the first he had published.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The evolution of languages was not the source of Darwin's theory of evolution. He had based that on variation of species, such as he had observed in finches in the [[Galapagos Islands]], who had appeared to be modifications of a common ancestor. Selection of domestic species to produce a new variety also played a role in his conclusions. The first edition of ''Origin of Species'' in 1859 discusses the language tree as though ''de novo'' under the topic of classification. Darwin criticises the synchronic method devised by [[Linnaeus]], suggesting that it be replaced by a "natural arrangement" based on evolution.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life | first=Charles | last=Darwin | location=London | publisher=J. Murray | year=1860 | page=422 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qin22m1rYsC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;dq=it+may+be+worth+while+to+illustrate+this+view+of+classification+by+taking+the+case+of+languages+inauthor:Darwin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2-UjT_iyO4Tu0gGHu4C3CA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects, had to be included, such an arrangement would, I think, be the only possible one. Yet it might be that some very ancient language had altered little, and had given rise to few new languages, whilst others (owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation of the several races, descended from a common race) had altered much, and had given rise to many new languages and dialects. The various degrees of difference in the languages from the same stock, would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and modern, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schleicher had never heard of Darwin before Haeckel brought him to Schleicher's attention. He had published his own work on the ''Stammbaum'' in an article of 1853, six years before the first edition of ''Origin of Species'' in 1859. The concept of descent of languages was by no means new. [[Thomas Jefferson]], a devout linguist himself, had proposed that the continual necessity for [[neologism]]s implies that languages must "progress" or "advance.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=In search of Jefferson's moose: notes on the state of cyberspace | first=David G |last=Post | location=Oxford; New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas foreshadow evolution of either biological species or languages, but after the contact of Schleicher with Darwin's ideas, and perhaps Darwin's contact with the historical linguists, Evolution and language change were inextricably linked, and would become the basis for classification. Now, as then, the main problems would be to prove specific lines of descent, and to identify the branch points.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===The phylogenetic tree===
The old metaphor was given an entirely new meaning under the old name by [[Joseph Harold Greenberg]] in a series of essays beginning about 1950. Since the adoption of the family tree metaphor by the linguists, the concept of [[evolution]] had been proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] and was generally accepted in biology. [[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomy]], the classification of living things, had already been invented by [[Carl Linnaeus]]. It used a [[binomial nomenclature]] to assign a [[species]] name and a [[genus]] name to every known living organism. These were arranged in a biological [[hierarchy]] under several [[phylum|phyla]], or most general groups, branching ultimately to the various species. The basis for this [[biological classification]] was the observed shared physical features of the species.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Darwin, however, reviving another ancient metaphor, the [[tree of life]], hypothesized that the groups of the Linnaean classification (today's [[taxon|taxa]]), descended in a tree structure over time from simplest to most complex. The Linnaean hierarchical tree was synchronic; Darwin envisioned a diachronic process of [[common descent]]. Where Linnaeus had conceived [[Taxonomic rank|rank]]s, which were consistent with the [[great chain of being]] adopted by the [[rationalist]]s, Darwin conceived [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Over the decades after Darwin it became clear that the ranks of Linnaeus' hierarchy did not correspond exactly to the lineages. It became the prime goal of taxonomy to discover the lineages and alter the classification to reflect them, which it did under the overall guidance of the [[Nomenclature Codes]], rule books kept by international organizations to authorize and publish proposals to reclassify species and other taxa. The new approach was called [[phylogeny]], the "generation of phyla," which devised a new tree metaphor, the [[phylogenetic tree]]. One unit in the tree and all its offspring units were a [[clade]] and the discovery of clades was [[cladistics]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.jpg|thumb|Classification of African language families]]
Greenberg began writing during a time when phylogenetic systematics lacked the tools available to it later: the computer (computational systematics) and [[DNA sequencing]] ([[molecular systematics]]). To discover a cladistic relationship researchers relied on as large a number of morphological similarities among species as could be defined and tabulated. Statistically the greater the number of similarities the more likely species were to be in the same clade. This approach appealed to Greenberg, who was interested in discovering [[linguistic universal]]s. Altering the tree model to make the family tree a phylogenetic tree he said:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On language: selected writings of Joseph H. Greenberg|editor-first=Keith M.|editor-last= Denning|editor2-first=Suzanne |editor2-last=Kemmer|contribution=A Quantitative Approach to the Typological Morphology of Language|origyear=1954|year=1990|first=Joseph H.|last=Greenberg|location=Stanford|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any language consists of thousands of forms with both sound and meaning ... any sound whatever can express any meaning whatever. Therefore, if two languages agree in a considerable number of such items ... we necessarily draw a conclusion of common historical origin. Such genetic classifications are not arbitrary ... the analogy here to biological classification is extremely close ... just as in biology we classify species in the same genus or high unit because the resemblances are such as to suggest a hypothesis of common descent, so with genetic hypotheses in language."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this analogy, a language family is like a [[clade]], the languages are like [[species]], the [[proto-language]] is like an ancestor [[taxon]], the language tree is like a [[phylogenetic tree]] and languages and dialects are like species and varieties. Greenberg formulated large tables of characteristics of hitherto neglected languages of Africa, the Americas, Indonesia and northern Eurasia and typed them according to their similarities. He called this approach "[[Linguistic typology|typological]] classification", arrived at by [[descriptive linguistics]] rather than by [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language, culture, and communication|first=Joseph Harold |last=Greenberg|year=1971|location=Stanford|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dates and glottochronology===

The [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] has been used by historical linguists to piece together tree models utilizing discrete lexical, morphological, and phonological data. Chronology can be found but there is no absolute date estimates utilizing this system. 

[[Glottochronology]] enables absolute dates to be estimated. Shared cognates (cognates meaning to have common historical origin) are calculate divergence times. However the method was found to be later discredited due to the data being unreliable. Due to this historical linguists have trouble with exact age estimation when pinpointing the age of the Indo-European language family. It could range from 4000 BP to 40,000 BP, or anywhere in-between those dates according to Dixon sourced from the rise and fall of language, (Cambridge University Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-rise-and-fall-of-languages/AE8A2A12CCCC0D82242A4C2B42DB1F76|title=The Rise and Fall of Languages by R. M. W. Dixon|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As seen in the article here.&lt;ref name="Nature Publishing Group"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=duLIDQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA437&amp;dq=%22tree+model%22+linguistics&amp;ots=Z4fRl4KI9d&amp;sig=8o4j9RMpA8ReKTpmuwfNQPheKsY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tree%20model%22%20linguistics&amp;f=false|title=Language-tree Divergence Times Support the Anatolian Theory of Indo-European Origin|last=D|first=Gray, Russell|last2=D|first2=Atkinson, Quentin|date=2003-11-27|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible solutions for Glottochronology are forthcoming due to [[Computational phylogenetics|computational phylogenetic]] methods. Techniques such as using models of evolution improves accuracy of tree branch length and topology. There for, using computational phylogenetic methods computational methods enable researchers to analyze linguistic data from evolutionary biology. This further assists in testing theories against each other, such as the [[Kurgan hypothesis|Kurgan theory]] and the [[Anatolian theory]], both claiming origins of Info-European languages.&lt;ref name="Nature Publishing Group"/&gt; 

==Computational phylogenetics in historical linguistics==
{{One source|section|date=October 2013}}
The comparative method compares features of various languages to assess how similar one language is to another. The results of such an assessment are data-oriented; that is, the results depend on the number of features and the number of languages compared. Until the arrival of the computer on the historical linguistics landscape, the numbers in both cases were necessarily small. The effect was of trying to depict a photograph using a small number of large pixels, or picture units. The limitations of the Tree Model were all too painfully apparent, resulting in complaints from the major historical linguists.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the late 20th century, linguists began using software intended for biological classification to classify languages. Programs and methods became increasingly sophisticated. In the early 21st century, the Computational Phylogenetics in Historical Linguistics (CPHL) project, a consortium of historical linguists, received funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] to study phylogenies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CPHL: Computational Phylogenetics in Historical Linguistics | url=http://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/CPHL/#software | year=2004–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indo-European family is a major topic of study. As of January, 2012, they had collected and coded a "screened" database of "22 phonological characters, 13 morphological characters, and 259 lexical characters," and an unscreened database of more. Wordlists of 24 Indo-European languages are included. Larger numbers of features and languages increase the precision, provided they meet certain criteria. Using specialized computer software, they test various phylogenetic hypotheses for their ability to account for the characters by genetic descent.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Limitations of the model===
One endemic limitation of the tree model is the very founding presumption on which it is based: it requires a classification based on languages.or, more generally, on [[variety (linguistics)|language varieties]]. Since a variety represents an abstraction from the totality of [[feature (linguistics)|linguistic features]], there is the possibility for information loss during the translation of data (from a map of [[isogloss]]es) into a tree. For example, there is the issue of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]]. They provide varieties that are not unequivocally one language or another but contain features characteristic of more than one. The issue of how they are to be classified is similar to the issue presented by [[ring species]] to the concept of [[species]] classification in biology.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The limitations of the tree model, in particular its inability to handle the non-discrete distribution of shared innovations in [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]], have been addressed through the development of non-cladistic (non-tree-based) methodologies. They include the [[wave model (linguistics)|Wave model]]; and more recently, the concept of [[linkage (linguistics)|linkage]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Bloomfield|1933|p=311}}; [[#heggarty|Heggarty ''et al.'' (2010)]]; [[#francois|François (2014)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional limitation of the tree model involves mixed and hybrid languages, as well as language mixing in general since the tree model allows only for divergences. For example, according to Zuckermann (2009:63),&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil'ad. 2009. [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf "Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns."] ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2:40-67.&lt;/ref&gt; "Israeli", his term for [[Hebrew language#Revival|Modern Hebrew]], which he regards as a Semito-European hybrid, "demonstrates that the reality of linguistic genesis is far more complex than a simple family tree system allows. 'Revived' languages are unlikely to have a single parent."

===Perfect phylogenies===
The purpose of phylogenetic software is to generate [[cladogram]]s, a special kind of tree in which the links only bifurcate; that is, at any node in the same direction only two branches are offered. The input data is a set of characters that can be assigned states in different languages, such as present (1) or absent (0). A language therefore can be described by a unique coordinate set consisting of the state values for all of the characters considered. These coordinates can be like each other or less so. Languages that share the most states are most like each other.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The software massages all the states of all the characters of all the languages by one of several mathematical methods to accomplish a pairwise comparison of each language with all the rest. It then constructs a cladogram based on degrees of similarity; for example, hypothetical languages, a and b, which are closest only to each other, are assumed to have a common ancestor, a-b. The next closest language, c, is assumed to have a common ancestor with a-b, and so on. The result is a projected series of historical paths leading from the overall common ancestor (the root) to the languages (the leaves). Each path is unique. There are no links between paths. Every leaf and node have one and only one ancestor. All the states are accounted for by descent from other states. A cladogram that conforms to these requirements is a perfect phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|p=383}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first there seemed to be little consistency of results in trials varying the factors presumed to be relevant. A new cladogram resulted from any change, which suggested that the method was not capturing the underlying evolution of languages but only reflecting the extemporaneous judgements of the researchers. In order to find the factors that did bear on phylogeny the researchers needed to have some measure of the accuracy of their results; i.e., the results needed to be calibrated against known phylogenies. They ran the experiment using different assumptions looking for the ones that would produce the closest matches to the most secure Indo-European phylogenies. Those assumptions could be used on problem areas of the Indo-European phylogeny with greater confidence.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

To obtain a reasonably valid phylogeny, the researchers found they needed to enter as input all three types of characters: phonological, lexical and morphological, which were all required to present a picture that was sufficiently detailed for calculation of phylogeny. Only qualitative characters produced meaningful results. Repeated states were too ambiguous to be correctly interpreted by the software; therefore characters that were subject to [[back formation]] and parallel development, which reverted a character to a prior state or adopted a state that evolved in another character, respectively, were screened from the input dataset.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|pp=384–385}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfect phylogenetic networks===
[[File:IE newtwork.png|thumb|left|300px|A phylogenetic network, one of many posited by the CPHL. The phylogenetic tree appear in black lines. The contact edges are the red lines. Here there are three, the most parsimonious number required to generate a feasible network for Indo-European.]]
Despite their care to code the best qualitative characters in sufficient numbers, the researchers could obtain no perfect phylogenies for some groups, such as Germanic and Albanian within Indo-European. They reasoned that a significant number of characters, which could not be explained by genetic descent from the group's calculated ancestor, were borrowed. Presumably, if the [[wave model]], which explained borrowing, were a complete explanation of the group's characters, no phylogeny at all could be found for it. If both models were partially effective, then a tree would exist, but it would need to be supplemented by non-genetic explanations. The researchers therefore modified the software and method to include the possibility of borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;The technical details of the [[algorithm]]s used are stated in {{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|loc=Appendix A}}. The details of the dataset are stated in Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers introduced into the experiment the concept of the interface, or allowed boundary over which character states would flow. A one-way interface, or edge, existed between a parent and a child. If only one-way edges were sufficient to explain the presence of all the states in a language, then there was no need to look beyond the perfect phylogeny. If not, then one or more contact edges, or bidirectional interfaces, could be added to the phylogeny. A language therefore might have more than one source of states: the parent or a contact language.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

A tree so modified was no longer a tree as such: there could be more than one path from root to leaf. The researchers called this arrangement a network. The states of a character still evolved along a unique path from root to leaf, but its origin could be either the root under consideration or a contact language. If all the states of the experiment could be accounted for by the network, it was termed a perfect phylogenetic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|pp=388–391}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibility and feasibility===
The generation of networks required two phases. In the first phase, the researchers devised a number of phylogenies, called candidate trees, to be tested for compatibility. A character is compatible when its origin is explained by the phylogeny generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|p=387}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a perfect phylogeny, all the characters are compatible and the compatibility of the tree is 100%. By the principle of parsimony, or [[Occam's razor]], no networks are warranted. Candidate trees were obtained by first running the phylogeny-generation software using the Indo-European dataset (the strings of character states) as input, then modifying the resultant tree into other hypotheses to be tested.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

None of the original candidate trees were perfect phylogenies, although some of the subtrees within them were. The next phase was to generate networks from the trees of highest compatibility scores by adding interfaces one at a time, selecting the interface of highest compatibility, until sufficiency was obtained; that is, the compatibility of the network was highest. As it turned out, the number of compatible networks generated might vary from none to over a dozen. However, not all the possible interfaces were historically feasible. Interfaces between some languages were geographically and chronologically not very likely. Inspecting the results, the researchers excluded the non-feasible interfaces until a list of only feasible networks remained, which could be arranged in order of compatibility score.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Most feasible network for Indo-European===
The researchers began with five candidate trees for Indo-European, lettered A-E, one generated from the phylogenetic software, two modifications of it and two suggested by [[Craig Melchert]], a historical linguist and Indo-Europeanist. The trees differed mainly in the placement of the most ambiguous group, the Germanic languages, and Albanian, which did not have enough distinctive characters to place it exactly. Tree A contained 14 incompatible characters; B, 19; C, 17; D, 21; E,18. Trees A and C had the best compatibility scores. The incompatibilities were all lexical, and A's were a subset of C's.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|p=396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent generation of networks found that all incompatibilites could be resolved with a minimum of three contact edges except for Tree E. As it did not have a high compatibility, it was excluded. Tree A had 16 possible networks, which a feasibility inspection reduced to three. Tree C had one network, but as it required an interface to Baltic and not Slavic, it was not feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|p=400}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree A, the most compatible and feasible tree, hypothesizes seven groups separating from Proto-Indo-European between about 4000 BC and 2250 BC, as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|p=398}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first to separate was Anatolian, about 4000 BC.
* Tocharian followed at about 3500 BC.
* Shortly thereafter, about 3250, Proto-Italo-Celtic (western Indo-European) separated, becoming Proto-Italic and Proto-Celtic at about 2500 BC.
* At about 3000, Proto-Albano-Germanic separated, becoming Albanian and Proto-Germanic at about 2000.
* At about 3000 Proto-Greco-Armenian (southern Indo-European) divided, becoming Proto-Greek and Proto-Armenian at about 1800.
* Balto-Slavic appeared about 2500, dividing into Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic at about 1000.
* Finally, Proto-Indo-European became Proto-Indo-Iranian (eastern Indo-European) at about 2250.

Trees B and E offer the alternative of Proto-Germano-Balto-Slavic (northern Indo-European), making Albanian an independent branch. The only date for which authors vouch is the last, based on the continuity of the [[Yamna culture]], the [[Andronovo Culture]] and known Indo-Aryan speaking cultures. All others are described as "dead reckoning."&lt;ref name=N401&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|p=401}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the phylogeny of best compatibility, A, three contact edges are required to complete the compatibility. This is group of edges with the least number of borrowing events:&lt;ref name=N401/&gt;

* First, an edge between Proto-Italic and Proto-Germanic, which must have begun after 2000, according to the dating scheme given.
* A second contact edge was between Proto-Italic and Proto-Greco-Armenian, which must have begun after 2500.
* The third contact edge is between Proto-Germanic and Proto-Baltic, which must have begun after 1000.

Tree A with the edges described above is described by the authors as "our best PPN."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nakhleh|2005|p=407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In all PPNs, it is clear that although the initial daughter languages became distinct in relative isolation, the later evolution of the groups can be explained only by evolution in proximity to other languages with which an exchange takes place by the wave model.

'''Voided biaxial slabs''' are [[reinforced concrete]] slabs in which voids reduce the amount of concrete.

While concrete has been used for thousands of years, the use of reinforced concrete is usually attributed to [[Joseph-Louis Lambot]] in 1848. [[Joseph Monier]], a French gardener, patented a design for reinforced garden tubs in 1868, and later patented reinforced concrete beams and posts for railway and road guardrails.

The main obstacle with concrete constructions, in case of horizontal slabs, is the high weight, which limits the [[Span (architecture)|span]]. For this reason major developments of reinforced concrete have focused on enhancing the span, either by reducing the weight or overcoming concrete's natural weakness in [[tension (physics)|tension]].

An early example is the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]], built 125 AD. Although not reinforced, [[coffers]] were used to reduce the weight.

==Biaxial slabs==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2016}}
Focus has been on biaxial slabs and ways to reduce the weight. Several methods have been introduced during the last decades, but with very limited success, due to major problems with shear capacity and fire resistance as well as impractical execution.

For decades,{{When|date=August 2016}} several attempts have been made to create biaxial slabs with hollow cavities in order to reduce the weight. Most attempts have consisted of laying blocks of a less heavy material like expanded polystyrene between the bottom and top reinforcement, while other types included waffle slabs and grid slabs.

Of these types, only waffle slabs can be regarded to have a certain use in the market. But the use will always be very limited due to reduced resistances towards shear, local punching and fire. The idea of placing large blocks of light material in the slab suffers from the same flaws, which is why the use of these systems has never gained acceptance and they are only used in a limited number of projects in Spanish-speaking countries.

==Composition==
The geometry of the BubbleDeck slab is identified by ellipsoids of a certain size, placed in a precise modular grid. All geometrical parameters of the slab can be described by a single parameter, the modulus named “a”. Modulus and corresponding deck heights are manufactured in steps (modulus in steps of 25&amp;nbsp;mm, and effective heights in steps of 50&amp;nbsp;mm)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.BubbleDeck.com BubbleDeck.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, fixing of the ellipsoids can be made in numerous ways, but using only the reinforcement meshes reduces superfluous material consumption and allows for an optimal geometrical proportion between concrete, reinforcement and voids.

The voids are positioned in the middle of the cross section, where concrete has limited effect, while maintaining solid sections in top and bottom where high stresses can exist. Hence, the slab is fully functional with regards to both positive and negative bending.
[[Image:kb bdimage002.gif]]

==Theory==
In principle, voided biaxial slabs act like solid slabs. Designing is consequently like for solid slabs, but with less load corresponding to the reduced amount of concrete. Investigations according to [[Eurocodes]] made at universities in Germany, Netherlands and Denmark, conclude that a  voided biaxial slabs acts like as a solid slab.&lt;ref&gt;Martina Schnellenbach-Held, StefanEhmann, Karsten Pfeffer: “BubbleDeck - New Ways in Concrete Building”. Technische Universität Darmstadt, DACON Volume 13, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martina Schnellenbach-Held, Karsten Pfeffer: “BubbleDeck Design of Biaxial Hollow Slabs”. Technische Universität Darmstadt, DACON Volume 14, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BubbleDeck Report from A+U Research Institute /Professor Kleinmann - the Eindhoven University of Technology / the Netherlands, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BubbleDeck Test Report by Koning &amp; Bienfait b.v. / The Netherlands, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tu-cottbus.de/Massivbau/Downloads/Vortrag_Schwitzke.pdf Report of BubbleDeck from Technische Universitaet in Cottbus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report from the Eindhoven University of Technology / the Netherlands: ” Broad comparison of concrete floor systems”. December 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byg.dtu.dk/upload/institutter/byg/publications/rapporter/byg-r074.pdf BubbleDeck Report from Technical University of Denmark, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report from Adviesbureau Peutz &amp; Associes b.v.: ”Comparison of BubbleDeck vs. Hollow core”. Netherlands, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Optimising of Concrete Constructions"; - The Engineering School in Horsens / Denmark, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

While a true biaxial slab as the BubbleDeck system must be calculated as a solid slab, ribbed slab systems, like the U-boot system, consisting of a grid of orthogonal "I" beams, must be calculated as beams.

The  voided biaxial slabs technology is directly incorporated in international standards as the Eurocodes, and various national codes such as the CUR in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bubbledeck.nl/files/file.php5?id=2 BubbleDeck.nl : CUR-aanbeveling 86-01]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shear===
The main difference between a solid slab and a voided biaxial slab refers to shear resistance. Due to the reduced concrete volume, the shear resistance will also be reduced. For a  voided biaxial slabs with spheres the shear resistance is proportional to the amount of concrete, as the special geometry shaped by the ellipsoidal voids acts like the famous Roman arch, enabling all concrete to be effective. This is only valid when considering the  voided biaxial slabs technology. Other types of voided biaxial slabs have reduced resistances towards shear, local punching and fire.

In practice, the reduced shear resistance will not lead to problems, as balls are simply left out where the shear is high, at columns and walls.&lt;ref&gt;Martina Schnellenbach-Held, Heiko Denk: “BubbleDeck Time-Dependent Behaviour, Local Punching Additional Experimental Tests”. Technische
Universität Darmstadt, DACON Volume 14, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schnellenbach-Held, M., Pfeffer, K.: “Tragverhalten zweiachsiger

zweiachsigen Hohlkörperdecken”. Fortschritt-Berichte VDI, VDI-Verlag, Düsseldorf 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Punching Shear Strength of BubbleDeck" - The Technical University of Denmark, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massivbau.tu-darmstadt.de/dacon/2003/slabs.pdf  BubbleDeck Test report from University of Darmstadt by Markus Aldejohann, Martina Schnellenbach-Held, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BubbleDeck Report from AEC Consulting Engineers Ltd. / Professor M.P. Nielsen - The Technical University of Denmark, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire===

As U-Boot Beton® is made of polypropylene, it is not toxic even if burnt. Moreover,the slab will not explode due to the escaping of over pressurised gas from the feet (4 feet for each formwork) that act as safety valves. Tests run at the CSI laboratory have demonstrated that with a cement cover of 3&amp;nbsp;cm the structure created with U-Boot Beton® is class REI 180.

As a  voided biaxial slab (with spheres only) acts like a solid slab, the fire resistance is just a matter of the amount of concrete layer. The fire resistance is dependent on the temperature in the rebars and hence the transport of heat. As the top and bottom of the  voided biaxial slab is solid, and the rebars are placed in the solid part, the fire resistance can be designed according to demands. Due to the specific shape of the voids, there are no issues with internal pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massivbau.tu-darmstadt.de/dacon/2002/bubbledeck.pdf  BubbleDeck Test report from University of Darmstadt by Markus Aldejohann and Martina Schnellenbach-Held, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TNO-Report on BubbleDeck for the Weena Tower / Rotterdam / the Netherlands, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TNO-Report for 230 mm BubbleDeck: ”Fire-safe in 120 minutes” the Netherlands, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Actual fire tests on slabs made by specific BubbleDeck geometry has been carried out in Europe, Asia and South America.

===Sound===
Tests have been carried out in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;German Test Certificate Number P-SAC 02/IV-065 according to DIN 4102-2 concerning BubbleDeck&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; slabs, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; UK&lt;ref&gt;BubbleDeck Test Report from Ian Sharland Ltd Airborne and Impact Sound
Insulation”.November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;BubbleDeck Test Report from Adviesbureau Peutz &amp; Associes b.v.: ”Sound
Resistance”.March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; according to ISO 140-4:1998, ISO
140-7:1998, ISO 717-1:1997 and ISO 717-2:1997 measuring impact and airborne sound. These tests show that 230&amp;nbsp;mm and thicker BubbleDeck&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; slabs can meet the national rules.

===Qualities===
*Low weight/stiffness ratio – influence of impact is proportional to weight.
*Simplicity and symmetry and uniform extent – Lessen the impact effect. Uniform and continuous distribution/flow of forces,
*Monolithic, continuous and ductile structure.

The BubbleDeck system fulfil these principles:
*Saves 35% weight compared to a corresponding solid slab – equal stiffness.
*Simple, monolithic behaviour, uniform and continuous distribution of forces.
*Max ductile structure - increased ductility due to increased strength/weight ratio.

===Approvals===
*Dutch Standards: From November 2001, The BubbleDeck system is incorporated in the Dutch Standards (by CUR – Civieltechnisch Centrum Uitvoering Research en Regelgeving).
*UK Standards: The BubbleDeck system can be treated as a normal flat slab supported on columns (BS 8110) according to CRIC (Concrete Research &amp; Innovation Centre under the Imperial College of Science, Technology &amp; Medicine), 1997.
*Danish Standards: The BubbleDeck system can be calculated from recognized principles and within existing standards - Directorate of Building and Housing, Municipality of Copenhagen, 1996.
*German Standards: The BubbleDeck system can be used according to existing technical standards according to Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik, 1994.

==Advantages==

===Comparisons===
A two way spanning voided biaxial slab construction compared to a traditional two way spanning non voided biaxial slab construction:
*The reduced weight of the slab will typical result in a change in design to longer spans and/or reduced deck thickness. The overall concrete consumption can be reduced with up to 50% depending on design, as a consequence of reduced mass in slabs, vertical structure and foundation.

A two way spanning biaxial slab construction compared to a one way spanning deck (traditionally a hollow core):
*One way spanning decks are supported by a combination of walls and beams. This leads to rigid and inflexible structures. This type of structure should be used with care in seismic regions due to the risk of progressive collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbfdtraining.com/usar/Rescue%20Specialist-Unit2%20-%20Structural%20Eng.%20Systems.pdf  Report on building systems in relation to seismic behaviour]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilica.com/Paper-ICELC01-ICELC01_69.html  "Investigation of seismic behaviour of hollow-core slabs by various methods" by Dr. M.R. Adlparvar et al., Azad University Tehran South Unit]&lt;/ref&gt;

As this floor type is made of complete prefab elements with no structural coherence, support moments are absent, resulting in increased material consumption.

A two way spanning voided biaxial slab construction with spheres according to the BubbleDeck system, compared to older voided slab constructions:
*Acts like a solid slab. Does not have the earlier problems with reduced resistances towards shear, local punching and fire.

===In general===
Benefits include:
*   Design freedom – flexible layout easily adapts to irregular &amp; curved plan layouts.
*   Reduced dead weight -35% removed allowing smaller foundation sizes.
*   Longer spans between columns – up to 50% further than traditional structures.
*   Downstand beams eliminated – quicker and cheaper erection of walls and services.
*   Load bearing walls eliminated – facilitating MMC with lightweight building envelopes.
*   Reduced concrete usage – 1&amp;nbsp;kg recycled plastic replaces 100&amp;nbsp;kg of concrete.
*   Environmentally green and sustainable – reduced energy &amp; carbon emissions.

8% of global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are due to cement production. 1 tonne of cement:&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.asce.org/files/pdf/SEICongressStructuralengineersandLEED07Apr29.pdf   Report from American Society of Civil Engineers: "Structural engineers, sustainability and LEED", p. 33, by Diana Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;
*   Releases 1 tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*   Consumes 5 million BTU of energy
*   Uses 2 tonnes of raw materials

Due to the BubbleDeck technology's green credentials, the use of the BubbleDeck system qualifies for LEED points in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rjc.ca/cms/index.cfm?group_id=1147&amp;office_id=1189&amp;type_id=1228&amp;project_id=1326   Read, Jones and Christoffersen: BubbleDeck LEED points in North America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.asce.org/files/pdf/SEICongressStructuralengineersandLEED07Apr29.pdf   Report from American Society of Civil Engineers: "Structural engineers, sustainability and LEED", p. 39 by Diana Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

===Execution of prefabricated version===

[[File:kb bdimage005.jpg|thumb]]

The overall floor area can be divided down into a series of planned individual elements, up to 3 m wide dependent upon site access, which are manufactured off-site using MMC techniques. These elements comprise the top and bottom reinforcement mesh, sized to suit the specific project, joined together with vertical lattice girders with the void formers trapped between the top and bottom mesh reinforcement to fix their optimum position. This is termed a ‘bubble-reinforcement’ sandwich, which is then cast into bottom layer of 60&amp;nbsp;mm pre-cast concrete, encasing the bottom mesh reinforcement, to provide permanent formwork within part of the overall finished slab depth.

On site the individual elements are then ‘stitched’ together with loose reinforcement simply laid centrally across the joints between elements. The splice bars are inserted loose above the pre-cast concrete layer between the bubbles, and purpose made mesh sheets tied across the top reinforcement mesh to join the elements
together. After the site finishing, concrete is poured and cured. This technique provides structural continuity across the entire floor slab – the joints between elements are then redundant without any structural effect – to create a seamless biaxial floor slab.

===Installation of pure in situ versions &lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.daliform.com Soluzioni innovative per l&amp;#039;edilizia -]&lt;/ref&gt;===
# The entire surface of the slab to be cast on site is shuttered with wood deckings (or similar systems), then the lower reinforconcrete bars are positioned in two mutually perpendicular directions according to the design and the lattice for the upper reinforconcrete is arranged. 
# The  voided biaxial slabs formworks are positioned using the lateral spacers joints to place them at the desired centre distance that will determine the beam width. Thanks to the conic elevator foot, the formworks will be lifted from the surface, making it possible for the lower slab to be formed. If double or triple elements are used, these elements must first be assembled, which will be supplied on distinct pallets in the yard.
# The positioning of the reinforconcretes is completed by placing above the formwork the upper bars in the two directions as well as the reinforcement for shear and punching where necessary, according to the design.
# The concrete casting must be performed in two phases to prevent the flotation of the formworks: an initial layer will be cast to fill a thickness equal to the height of the elevator foot. Casting will continue for this first portion of the slab until the concrete starts to set and become semi fluid.
# Once suitably set, the casting can be restarted from the starting point, completely burying the voided biaxial system. The casting is then levelled and smoothed in a traditional manner.
# Once the structure has hardened, the formwork can be removed. The surface is smooth in correspondence of the soffit.

==Construction problems and collapse==
In 2017 the Bubbledeck system caused controversy due to the collapse of a parking garage at [[Eindhoven]] airport in [[the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/05/eindhoven-airport-parking-garage-collapses-weeks-before-opening-date/  "Eindhoven airport parking garage collapses, weeks before opening date by dutchnews.nl, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Royal BAM Group]], the contractor in charge, the shear strength of the interface between the precast concrete slabs was insufficient. According to the contractor this may be caused due to the high temperatures during construction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bam.com/en/press/press-releases/2017/9/investigation-results-known-of-technical-cause-partial-collapse  "Investigation results known of technical cause partial collapse Eindhoven Airport parking garage by BAM Group, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
After the incident an investigation was started among buildings using the same flooring system, this led to the closure of several buildings, including the Polak-building of the [[Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam|University of Rotterdam]] and a school building under construction in [[Hoeven]] in the Netherlands.
All tested buildings are proven safe, and are reopened.

'''Wagaydyic''' is a pair of closely related but otherwise unclassified [[Australian Aboriginal languages]], the moribund [[Wadjiginy language|Wadjiginy]] (Wagaydy) and the extinct [[Kandjerramalh language|Kandjerramalh]] (Pungupungu).

Tryon (1987) notes that the two languages are 80% cognate, but there are serious grammatical differences that prevent them from being considered dialects of a single language.&lt;ref&gt;{{AIATSIS|N11|Pungupungu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unattested [[Giyug language|Giyug]] may have been related.  The Wagaydyic languages have previously been classified with [[Malak-Malak language|Malak-Malak]] into a [[Northern Daly languages|Northern Daly]] family, but similarities appear to be due to lexical and morphological borrowing from Malak-Malak, at least in Wadjiginy.

'''Waldemar Rosenberger''', ({{Lang-ru|Владимир Карлович Розенбергер}}, Vladimir Karlovich Rozenberger, 1848–1918) from [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], became director of the [[Volapük language|Volapük]] Academy in 1892.  Under his leadership, the Academy began to experiment more with the Volapük language.  In 1902 the Academy proposed a heavily revised version which was known as Neutral and later [[Idiom Neutral]].

[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|The [[Rosetta Stone]], with writing in three different scripts, was instrumental in deciphering Ancient Egyptian.]]

'''Writing''' is a medium of human [[communication]] that represents [[language]] and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or [[spoken language]]. Writing is not a language, but a [[tool]] used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]], and [[semantics]], with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called ''text'', and the recipient of text is called a ''reader''. Motivations for writing include [[publication]], [[storytelling]], correspondence, [[record keeping]] and [[diary]]. Writing has been instrumental in keeping [[history]], maintaining [[culture]], dissemination of knowledge through the [[Mass media|media]] and the formation of [[legal systems]].

As human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in [[Mesopotamia]] outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}} In both [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesoamerica]], writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events.

== Means of recording information ==
[[H.G. Wells]] argued that writing has the ability to "put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =A Short History of the World |first=H. G. |last=Wells |year=1922 |page=41|title-link=A Short History of the World (H. G. Wells) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing systems ===
{{Main article|Writing system}}
[[File:Fountain pen writing (literacy).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alphabet]]ic writing is a frequent category in [[human communication]]. ]]
The major [[writing system]]s—methods of inscription—broadly fall into five categories: [[logographic]], [[Syllable|syllabic]], [[alphabetic]], [[featural]], and [[ideographic]] (symbols for ideas). A sixth category, [[pictographic]], is insufficient to represent language on its own, but often forms the core of logographies.

====Logographies====
A [[logogram]] is a written character which represents a word or [[morpheme]]. A vast number of logograms are needed to write [[Chinese characters]], [[cuneiform]], and [[Mayan script|Mayan]], where a glyph may stand for a morpheme, a syllable, or both—("logoconsonantal" in the case of hieroglyphs). Many logograms have an ideographic component (Chinese "radicals", hieroglyphic "determiners"). For example, in Mayan, the glyph for "fin", pronounced "ka", was also used to represent the syllable "ka" whenever the pronunciation of a logogram needed to be indicated, or when there was no logogram. In Chinese, about 90% of characters are compounds of a semantic (meaning) element called a ''radical'' with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation, called a ''phonetic''. However, such phonetic elements complement the logographic elements, rather than vice versa.

The main logographic system in use today is [[Chinese characters]], used with some modification for the various languages or dialects of [[languages of China|China]], [[languages of Japan|Japan]], and sometimes in [[Korean language|Korean]] despite the fact that in [[South Korea|South]] and [[North Korea]], the phonetic [[Hangul]] system is mainly used.

====Syllabaries====
A [[syllabary]] is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) [[syllable]]s. A glyph in a syllabary typically represents a consonant followed by a vowel, or just a vowel alone, though in some scripts more complex syllables (such as consonant-vowel-consonant, or consonant-consonant-vowel) may have dedicated glyphs. Phonetically related syllables are not so indicated in the script. For instance, the syllable "ka" may look nothing like the syllable "ki", nor will syllables with the same vowels be similar.

Syllabaries are best suited to languages with a relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. Other languages that use syllabic writing include the [[Linear B]] script for [[Mycenaean Greek]]; [[Cherokee]]; [[Ndyuka language|Ndjuka]], an English-based [[creole language]] of [[Surinam]]; and the [[Vai language|Vai]] script of [[Liberia]]. Most logographic systems have a strong syllabic component. [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]], though technically an [[abugida]], has fused consonants and vowels together to the point where it is learned as if it were a syllabary.

====Alphabets====
{{See also|History of the alphabet}}

An [[alphabet]] is a set of symbols, each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly [[phonology|phonological]] alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.

As languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

=====Abjads=====
In most of the writing systems of the Middle East, it is usually only the consonants of a word that are written, although vowels may be indicated by the addition of various diacritical marks. Writing systems based primarily on marking the consonant phonemes alone date back to the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Such systems are called ''[[abjad]]s'', derived from the Arabic word for "alphabet".

=====Abugidas=====
In most of the alphabets of India and Southeast Asia, vowels are indicated through diacritics or modification of the shape of the consonant. These are called ''[[abugida]]s''. Some abugidas, such as [[Ethiopic]] and [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cree]], are learned by children as syllabaries, and so are often called "syllabics". However, unlike true syllabaries, there is not an independent glyph for each syllable.

Sometimes the term "alphabet" is restricted to systems with separate letters for consonants and vowels, such as the [[Latin alphabet]], although abugidas and abjads may also be accepted as alphabets. Because of this use, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] is often considered to be the first alphabet.

====Featural scripts====
A featural script notates the building blocks of the phonemes that make up a language. For instance, all sounds pronounced with the lips ("labial" sounds) may have some element in common. In the Latin alphabet, this is accidentally the case with the letters "b" and "p"; however, labial "m" is completely dissimilar, and the similar-looking "q" and "d" are not labial. In Korean [[hangul]], however, all four labial consonants are based on the same basic element, but in practice, Korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet, and the featural elements tend to pass unnoticed.

Another featural script is [[SignWriting]], the most popular writing system for many [[sign languages]], where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented [[secular icon|iconically]]. Featural scripts are also common in fictional or invented systems, such as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tengwar]].

====Historical significance of writing systems====
[[Image:Olin-Warner-LoC-tympanum-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|300px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] representing Writing, above exterior of main entrance doors, [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington DC, 1896.]]

Historians draw a sharp distinction between prehistory and history, with history defined by the advent of writing. The cave paintings and petroglyphs of prehistoric peoples can be considered precursors of writing, but they are not considered true writing because they did not represent language directly.

Writing systems develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them. Sometimes the shape, orientation, and meaning of individual signs changes over time. By tracing the development of a script, it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how the script changed over time.

===Tools and materials===
{{See also|writing implements}}
The many tools and writing materials used throughout history include [[stone tablet]]s, [[clay tablet]]s, bamboo slats, [[papyrus]], [[wax tablet]]s, [[vellum]], [[parchment]], [[paper]], [[intaglio printing|copperplate]], [[stylus]]es, [[quill]]s, [[ink brush]]es, [[pencil]]s, [[pen]]s, and many styles of [[lithography]]. The Incas used knotted cords known as [[quipu]] (or khipu) for keeping records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.edu/index.html|title=The Khipu Database Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[typewriter]] and various forms of [[word processor]]s have subsequently become widespread writing tools, and various studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

''Geschichte der Schrift'', C.H. Beck, {{ISBN|3-406-47998-7}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It is a product of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] that was in [[Romania]] and neighbouring regions.]]

By definition, the modern practice of [[history]] begins with written records. Evidence of human culture without writing is the realm of [[prehistory]]. The [[Dispilio Tablet]] (Greece), [[Jiahu symbols]] (China) and [[Tărtăria tablets]] (Romania), which have been carbon dated to the [[6th millennium BC]], are recent discoveries of the earliest known neolithic writings.

===Mesopotamia===
While neolithic writing is a current research topic, conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient Near East. Writing most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures, which needed reliable means for transmitting information, maintaining financial accounts, keeping historical records, and similar activities. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}}

Archaeologist [[Denise Schmandt-Besserat]] determined the link between previously uncategorized clay "tokens", the oldest of which have been found in the Zagros region of Iran, and the first known writing, [[Mesopotamian]] [[cuneiform]].&lt;ref name="Rudgley"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age| last=Rudgley| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Rudgley| year=2000| pages=48–57| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In approximately 8000 BC, the Mesopotamians began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods. Later they began placing these tokens inside large, hollow clay containers (bulla, or globular envelopes) which were then sealed. The quantity of tokens in each container came to be expressed by impressing, on the container's surface, one picture for each instance of the token inside. They next dispensed with the tokens, relying solely on symbols for the tokens, drawn on clay surfaces. To avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object (for example: 100 pictures of a hat to represent 100 hats), they 'counted' the objects by using various small marks. In this way the Sumerians added "a system for enumerating objects to their incipient system of symbols".

The original [[Mesopotamian]] writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts. By the end of the 4th millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing, Samuel Noah Kramer, ''Thirty Nine Firsts in Recorded History'' pp. 381–383&lt;/ref&gt; the Mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers. This system was gradually augmented with using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted by means of [[pictographs]]. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but by the 29th century BC also for phonetic elements. Around 2700 BC, cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. About that time, Mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for logograms, syllables, and numbers. This script was adapted to another Mesopotamian language, the [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Old Assyrian period|Assyrian]] and [[Babylonia]]n) around 2600 BC, and then to others such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hattian language|Hattian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]. With the adoption of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as the 'lingua franca' of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609 BC), Old Aramaic was also adapted to Mesopotamian cuneiform. The last cuneiform scripts in Akkadian discovered thus far date from the 1st century AD.

===Elamite scripts===
Over the centuries, three distinct Elamite scripts developed.
[[Proto-Elamite]] is the oldest known writing system from Iran. In use only for a brief time (c. 3200–2900 BC), clay tablets with Proto-Elamite writing have been found at different sites across Iran. The Proto-Elamite script is thought to have developed from early [[cuneiform]] (proto-cuneiform). The Proto-Elamite script consists of more than 1,000 signs and is thought to be partly [[logogram|logographic]].

[[Linear Elamite]] is a writing system attested in a few monumental inscriptions in Iran. It was used for a very brief period during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from Proto-Elamite, although this cannot be proven since Linear-Elamite has not been deciphered. Several scholars have attempted to decipher the script, most notably [[:de:Walther Hinz|Walther Hinz]] and [[:it:Piero Meriggi|Piero Meriggi]].

The [[Elamite cuneiform]] script was used from about 2500 to 331 BC, and was adapted from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]. The Elamite cuneiform script consisted of about 130 symbols, far fewer than most other cuneiform scripts.

====Cretan and Greek scripts====
{{Further information|Cretan hieroglyphs|Linear A|Linear B}}

[[Cretan hieroglyphs]] are found on artifacts of [[Crete]] (early-to-mid-2nd millennium BC, MM I to MM III, overlapping with Linear A from MM IIA at the earliest). [[Linear B]], the writing system of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]],&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."/&gt; has been deciphered while [[Linear A]] has yet to be deciphered. The sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping, but distinct writing systems can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."&gt;{{harvnb|Olivier|1986|pp=377f.}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name group="A"&gt;Beginning date refers to first attestations, the assumed origins of all scripts lie further back in the past.&lt;/ref&gt; Cretan hieroglyphs were used in Crete from c. 1625 to 1500 BC; Linear A was used in the [[Aegean Islands]] ([[Kea (island)|Kea]], [[Cythera (island)|Kythera]], [[Milos|Melos]], [[Santorini|Thera]]), and the [[Greek mainland]] ([[Laconia]]) from c. 18th century to 1450 BC; and Linear B was used in Crete ([[Knossos]]), and mainland ([[Pylos]], [[Mycenae]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Tiryns]]) from c. 1375 to 1200 BC.

===China===
{{Further information|Oracle bone script|Bronzeware script}}

The earliest surviving examples of writing in China—inscriptions on so-called "[[oracle bone]]s", tortoise [[plastron]]s and ox [[scapula]]e used for divination—date from around 1200 BC in the late [[Shang dynasty]]. A small number of bronze inscriptions from the same period have also survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Historians have found that the type of [[Media (arts)|media]] used had an effect on what the writing was documenting and how it was used.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 2003, archaeologists reported discoveries of [[Jiahu symbols|isolated tortoise-shell carvings]] dating back to the 7th millennium BC, but whether or not these symbols are related to the characters of the later oracle-bone script is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|196px|thumbnail|right|[[Narmer Palette]], with the two serpopards representing unification of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], [[3000 B.C.|3000 B. C.]]]]
The earliest known [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] inscriptions are the [[Narmer Palette]], dating to c. 3200 BC, and several recent discoveries that may be slightly older, though these glyphs were based on a much older artistic rather than written tradition. The hieroglyphic script was [[logogram|logographic]] with phonetic adjuncts that included an effective [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|alphabet]].

Writing was very important in maintaining the Egyptian empire, and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of [[scribe]]s. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status.

The world's [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|oldest known alphabet]] appears to have been developed by Canaanite turquoise miners in the Sinai desert around the mid-19th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwasser, Orly. "How the Alphabet Was Born from Hieroglyphs", Biblical Archaeology Review, Mar/Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30 crude inscriptions have been found at a mountainous Egyptian mining site known as Serabit el-Khadem. This site was also home to a temple of Hathor, the "Mistress of turquoise". A later, two line inscription has also been found at Wadi el-Hol in Central Egypt. Based on [[hieroglyph]]ic prototypes, but also including entirely new symbols, each sign apparently stood for a consonant rather than a word: the basis of an alphabetic system. It was not until the 12th to 9th centuries, however, that the alphabet took hold and became widely used.

===Indus Valley===
{{Main article|Indus script}}

Indus script refers to short strings of symbols associated with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (which spanned modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]]) used between 2600 and 1900 BC. In spite of many attempts at decipherments and claims, it is as yet undeciphered. The term 'Indus script' is mainly applied to that used in the mature Harappan phase, which perhaps evolved from a few signs found in early [[Harappa]] after 3500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, David (1999). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/334517.stm 'Earliest writing' found]" BBC&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by the mature Harappan script. The script is written from right to left,&lt;ref&gt;(Lal 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes follows a [[boustrophedonic]] style. Since the number of principal signs is about 400–600,&lt;ref&gt;(Wells 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; midway between typical logographic and syllabic scripts, many scholars accept the script to be logo-syllabic&lt;ref&gt;(Bryant 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically syllabic scripts have about 50–100 signs whereas logographic scripts have a very large number of principal signs). Several scholars maintain that structural analysis indicates that an [[agglutinative]] language underlies the script.

===Central Asia===
In 2001, archaeologists discovered that there was a civilization in [[Central Asia]] that used writing c. 2000 BC. An excavation near [[Ashgabat]], the capital of [[Turkmenistan]], revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that was used as a stamp seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient writing found in Turkmenistan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1330705.stm |quote=A previously unknown civilisation was using writing in Central Asia 4,000 years ago, hundreds of years before Chinese writing developed, archaeologists have discovered.

===Phoenician writing system and descendants===
The [[Proto-Sinaitic]] script, in which [[Proto-Canaanite]] is believed to have been first written, is attested as far back as the 19th century BC. The [[Phoenician script|Phoenician writing system]] was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script sometime before the 14th century BC, which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from [[Hieratic]], [[Cuneiform]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. This writing system was an odd sort of syllabary in which only consonants are represented. This script was adapted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greeks]], who adapted certain consonantal signs to represent their vowels. The [[Cumae alphabet]], a variant of the early Greek alphabet, gave rise to the [[Etruscan alphabet]] and its own descendants, such as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Rune]]s. Other descendants from the [[Greek alphabet]] include [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], used to write [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], among others. The Phoenician system was also adapted into the [[Aramaic script]], from which the [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]] and the [[Arabic script]]s are descended.

The [[Tifinagh]] script (Berber languages) is descended from the Libyco-Berber script, which is assumed to be of Phoenician origin.

===Mesoamerica===
A stone slab with 3,000-year-old writing, known as the [[Cascajal Block]], was discovered in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]] and is an example of the oldest script in the Western Hemisphere, preceding the oldest [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] writing by approximately 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John Noble |last=Wilford |authorlink=John Noble Wilford |title=Writing May Be Oldest in Western Hemisphere |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/science/15writing.html |quote=A stone slab bearing 3,000-year-old writing previously unknown to scholars has been found in the Mexican state of Veracruz, and archaeologists say it is an example of the oldest script ever discovered in the Western Hemisphere. |work=New York Times |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Helen |last=Briggs |title='Oldest' New World writing found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5347080.stm |quote=Ancient civilisations in Mexico developed a writing system as early as 900 BC, new evidence suggests. |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Oldest Writing in the New World |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5793/1610 |first=Maria del Carmen |last=Rodríguez Martínez |display-authors=etal |year=2006 |volume=313 |issue=5793 |pages=1610–1614 |doi=10.1126/science.1131492 |pmid=16973873 |quote=A block with a hitherto unknown system of writing has been found in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico.

Of several [[pre-Columbian]] scripts in [[Mesoamerica]], the one that appears to have been best developed, and the only one to be deciphered, is the [[Maya script]]. The earliest inscription identified as Maya dates to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Saturno2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saturno|first=William A.|author2=David Stuart |author3=Boris Beltrán |title=Early Maya Writing at San Bartolo, Guatemala|journal=Science|date=3 March 2006|volume=311|issue=5765|pages=1281–1283|doi=10.1126/science.1121745|pmid=16400112|bibcode=2006Sci...311.1281S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya writing used logograms complemented by a set of syllabic glyphs, somewhat similar in function to modern Japanese writing.

===South America===
The [[Incas]] had no known script. Their [[quipu]] system of recording information—based on knots tied along one or many linked cords—was apparently used for inventory and accountancy purposes and could not encode textual information.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Dacia===
Three stone slabs were found by Romanian archaeologist [[Nicolae Vlassa]], in the mid-20th century (1961) in [[Tărtăria]] (present-day [[Alba County]], [[Transylvania]]), [[Romania]], ancient land of [[Dacia]], inhabited by Dacians, which were a population who may have been related to the [[Getae]]s and [[Thracians]].
One of the slabs contains 4 groups of pictographs divided by lines. Some of the characters are also found in Ancient [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], as well as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]] and [[Iberian scripts|Iberian]].
The origin and the timing of the writings are disputed, because there are no precise evidence [[in situ]], the slabs cannot be carbon dated, because of the bad treatment of the [[Cluj]] museum. There are indirect carbon dates found on a skeleton discovered near the slabs, that certifies the 5300–5500 BC period.

==Modern importance==
In the 21st century, writing has become an important part of daily life as [[technology]] has connected individuals from across the globe through systems such as [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. [[Literacy]] has grown in importance as a factor for success in the modern world. In the United States, the ability to [[reading (process)|read]] and write are necessary for most jobs, and multiple programs are in place to aid both children and adults in improving their literacy skills. For example, the emergence of the [[writing center]] and community-wide literacy councils aim to help students and community members sharpen their writing skills. These resources, and many more, span across different age groups in order to offer each individual a better understanding of their language and how to express themselves via writing in order to perhaps improve their [[socioeconomic status]].

Other parts of the world have seen an increase in writing abilities as a result of programs such as the [[World Literacy Foundation]] and [[International Literacy Foundation]], as well as a general push for increased global communication.
