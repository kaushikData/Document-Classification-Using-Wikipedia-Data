The '''A477'''  is a major road in [[Pembrokeshire|South Pembrokeshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]] connecting [[St Clears]] and [[Johnston, Pembrokeshire|Johnston]]. Its route includes the [[Cleddau Bridge]], a [[toll bridge]] linking [[Pembroke Dock]] and [[Neyland]].

From the [[A40 road (Great Britain)|A40]] in St Clears, the A477 is a trunk road with primary status as far as the Waterloo roundabout in Pembroke Dock, on the southeast side of the [[Milford Haven Waterway]]. Responsibility for the management and maintenance of this section lies with the [[South Wales Trunk Road Agent]] on behalf of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]]. From there the responsibility for maintaining the A477 is held by [[Pembrokeshire County Council]].

==History==
[[File:A477Road 1923MOTMap.png|thumb|left|Original route of the A477 between Pembroke Dock and Red Roses(1923)]]
[[File:New A477 Red Roses By Pass - looking west-geograph-3928687-by-welshbabe.jpg|thumb|left|Red Roses bypass - looking west]]
A route from St Clears to Pembroke Dock was first surveyed by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1826, as part of a review of the route of the mail service from London to Ireland that at the time went via the docks at Milford Haven. A decision was taken in 1827 to move the mail port from Milford Haven to Hobbs Point in Pembroke Dock, and to pursue the access route from St Clears to Pembroke Dock. By 1830, a section of the road between the villages of [[Llanddowror]] and [[Red Roses]] had been completed.&lt;ref name="Ayres2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ayres |first=George |date=2011 |title=History of the Mail Routes to Ireland Until 1850 |page=64-65 |isbn=9781446605042}}&lt;/ref&gt; A levy on mail passing through Milford was introduced by the Postage Act 1836, to be used to fund the new route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act | title = Postage Act 1836 | number = 6 Will 4 c.25 | language = English | date = {{date|1836-06-21|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full route was completed in 1839, running from St Clears via Llanddowror, Red Roses, [[Llanteg]], [[Begelly]] and [[Carew, Pembrokeshire|Carew]] to Pembroke Dock.&lt;ref name="Ayres2011" /&gt;

Road designations were first allocated by the [[Ministry of Transport]] in 1922 with the road between Red Roses and Pembroke Dock being designated the A477. The section between St Clears and Red Roses, which was originally part of the A40, was redesignated the A477 by the early 1930s.{{efn|The 1924-25 Ordnance Survey MoT map still shows the St.Clears-Red Roses section as part of the A40. By the 1932 Ordnance Survey Ten Mile map, it is part of the A477.}}

The 22-mile section of the road from its start at St Clears as far as Nash{{mdash}}which is a convenient distribution point for places on the south side of Milford Haven{{mdash}}was promoted to a [[Trunk road#United Kingdom|trunk road]] following an announcement by the (then) [[Secretary of State for Wales]], [[Cledwyn Hughes]], on 14 November 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wales (Trade and Industry) House of Commons debates |date=1966-11-14 |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=1966-11-14a.40.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further {{convert|2+3/4|mi}} from Nash to Waterloo roundabout in Pembroke Dock were upgraded to trunk road in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Hansard|house=House of Commons |title=Trunk Roads |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-01-25/Writtens-7.html |date=25 January 1993 |speaker=Sir Wyn Roberts |column=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cleddau bridge1.jpg|thumb|The [[Cleddau Bridge]] became operational during 1975]]

The Cleddau Bridge is funded by tolls which are collected at Pembroke Dock from traffic in both directions. Pedestrians and cyclists are free of charge.

They are, since 1993, 35p for motorcycles, 75p for cars, £1.50 for heavy vehicles. Car drivers may also buy books of 20 or 50 bridge tickets which reduces the cost to 60p per crossing. The toll booths only accept cash or the pre-purchased tickets. Toll booths with barriers were introduced in September 2004 to reduce the number of vehicles driving through without paying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

A review was carried out in early 2016, when Pembrokeshire County Councillors voted that all toll charges would remain unchanged and would not be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-34143903|title=Pembrokeshire toll bridge to be reviewed after complaint|publisher=BBC News |date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-36285073|title=Pembrokeshire's Cleddau Bridge tolls to stay the same|publisher=BBC News |date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, the County Council and the Welsh Assembly Government agree to abolish tolls on the Cleddau Bridge from April 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46046474&lt;/ref&gt;

He is Emeritus Fellow of [[Downing College, Cambridge]] and was former Director of the Centre of African Studies at the University of Cambridge. Grove researched  Environmental Issues and Policy and the landscape change in southern Europe and Climate change and desertification with a focus on Africa and southern Europe.

== Career and work  ==
1949-1982 he was Lecturer at the Department of Geography, University of Cambridge and from 1980-1986 Director of the Centre for African Studies. 1963-1991 he was appointed fellow of the Downing College. He has written a number of books, including "Africa South of the Sahara",&lt;ref&gt;Africa South of the Sahara Alfred Thomas Grove, Oxford U.P., 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and various books about the [[Little Ice Age]] in Europe. So together (with Jean Grove) 'Little Ice Ages Ancient and Modern', 2004 and The "[[Little Ice Age]]" and its geomorphological consequences in Mediterranean Europe' and together with [[Oliver Rackham]]'The Nature of Mediterranean Europe', an important contribution to [[environmental history]]. With regard to the alleged [[tragedy of the commons]] and neomalthusian approaches e.g. of [[Garrett Hardin]] he denounced Hardins interpretation of the failure of commons  as the one of "an American with no notion at all how [[Commons]] actually work".&lt;ref&gt;The Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History, by Alfred Thomas Grove, Oliver Rackham, Yale University Press, 2003, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;supported by fellow environmental historian [[Joachim Radkau]] Nature and Power, A Global History of the Environment, by , 2008, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Environmental skepticism}}
While Grove does support increasing evidence of human activity is causing global warming, he sees definite and conclusive evidence in the field of climate change as almost an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;A.T. Grove and E. Lopez-Gunn (2010) Uncertainty in Climate Change, Real Instituto Elcano working paper, Madrid, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, his consideration of the problem in his 2010 paper leads him to the conclusion that despite this inherent uncertainty, the evidence that human activity is causing global warming is substantial, and that it is therefore 'safer to act, to mitigate and adapt with the aim of slowing down change'. In his work about Mediterranean Europe he doubts the common wisdom of a 'Lost Eden,' a formerly fertile region, that had been progressively degraded and desertified by human mismanagement.&lt;ref name =yale/&gt;  The simplistic, [[environmental determinist]] notion of a Mediterranean Paradise on Earth in antiquity, which was destroyed by destructive later civilizations dates however back to at least the eighteenth century and was fashionable in archaeological and historical circles for centuries. However the authors argue that this believe stems from the failure of the recent landscape to measure up to the imaginary past as idealized by artists, poets and scientists of the early modern Enlightenment.&lt;ref name =yale/&gt; Grove and Rackham tried to track the evolution of climate, vegetation and landscape in southern Europe from prehistoric times till present and point out that climate has usually been unstable and plant cover accommodated to various extremes and became resilient with regard to various patterns of human activity.&lt;ref name =yale/&gt; The authors assume that people had already transformed most parts of Mediterranean Europe 4,000 years ago and the “humanization of the landscape” overlapped with the appearance of the present Mediterranean climate.&lt;ref name =yale/&gt; In so far humanization was not the cause of climate change.&lt;ref name =yale/&gt; To the contrary, the wide ecological diversity typical of Mediterranean Europe was man made. The greatest human induced changes came since World War II as rural populations throughout the region abandoned traditional subsistence economies and left the traditional agricultural patterns towards setting sceneries for travelers, which resulted in more monotonous, large-scale formations. As real threats to Mediterranean landscapes they see the overdevelopment of coastal areas, abandonment of mountains and the already mentioned loss of traditional acricultural occupations.&lt;ref name =yale&gt;The Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History, by Alfred Thomas Grove, Oliver Rackham, Yale University Press, 2003, [http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300100556 review at Yale university press] [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_interdisciplinary_history/v032/32.3fagan.pdfThe Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History (review) [[Brian M.

== Family and heritage ==
Grove married [[Jean Grove|Jean Mary Clark]] (1927&amp;ndash;2001), herself a renowned glaciologist and climate historian and sister of [[Margaret Spufford]]. They had six children, among them [[Richard Grove]]. Grove is among the trustees of the [[Jean Grove#The Jean Grove Trust|Jean Grove Trust]] in Cambridge, a small Roman Catholic charity which funds the education of children in Ethiopia through direct links with four schools in different parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://charities.findthebest.co.uk/l/45552/The-Jean-Grove-Trust-in-Cambridge-England Jean Grove Trust entry]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former '''American Congress on Surveying and Mapping''' (ACSM) was an international [[professional association]] representing the interests of those engaged in measuring and communicating spatial data relating to the Earth's surface. Until recently, ACSM was composed of only two autonomous professional societies, namely:

* The [[American Association for Geodetic Surveying]] (AAGS)
* The [[National Society of Professional Surveyors]], Inc. (NSPS)

In 2012, ACSM legally merged into the NSPS. But it still considers AAGS to be a closely affiliated member organization. During the 2000s two previous member organizations of ACSM, namely the [[Cartographic and Geographic Information Society]] (CaGIS,) first, and then later on, the [[Geographic and Land Information Society]] (GLIS) removed themselves more or less from ACSM. 

However, GLIS still has some affiliation with NSPS, via their occasional contributions to a former ACSM publications: the quarterly Surveying and Land Information Science (SaLIS) technical journal which is now officially published by the NSPS but also continues to publish submissions from AAGS as well. They also previously contributed to the bimonthly ''Bulletin'', which is no longer in publication.

'''Border irregularities of the United States''', particularly [[panhandles]] and highway incursions into other jurisdictions, are shown here. Often they are a result of borders which do not conform to geological features.

== International ==

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Canada–United States border#Boundary divisions}}There are several exclaves between the United States and Canada, including the entire state of [[Alaska]] (though the state can still be accessed by sea from the United States). Other exclaves include [[Akwesasne]], the [[Northwest Angle]], and [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]]. 

The status of the waters around [[Dixon Entrance|Nunez Rocks]] is disputed. Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation ("bare at half-tide"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NSDE/|author=U.S. National Geodetic Survey|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) area (LTE) that is south of a line known as the "A-B" Line,&lt;ref name="IBRU"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb5-3_gray.pdf |title=Canada's Unresolved Maritime Boundaries|page=61|last=Gray|first=David H.| work= IBRU Boundary and Security Bulletin|year=Autumn 1997|accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was defined in a 1903 arbitration decision on the [[Alaska boundary dispute|Alaska–Canada boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalboundarycommission.org/coordinates/PortlandCanal.htm |title= International Boundary Commission definition of the Canada/US boundary in the NAD83 CSRS reference frame |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court specified the initial boundary point (Point "A") at the northern end of Dixon Entrance&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|title=Boundary Disputes and Treaties|first=James|last=White|publisher=Glasgow, Brook &amp; Company|location=Toronto|year=1914|pages=936–958}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Point "B" {{convert|72|nmi|mi km}} to the east.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Alaska Boundary|last=Davidson|first=George|publisher=Alaska Packers Association|location=San Francisco|year=1903|pages=79–81, 129–134, 177–179, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada relies on the "A-B" Line as rendering nearly all of Dixon Entrance as Canadian internal waters. The U.S. does not recognize the "A-B" Line as an official boundary, instead regarding it as allocating sovereignty over the land masses within the Dixon Entrance,&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; with Canada's land south of the line. The U.S. regards the waters as subject to international marine law, and in 1977 it defined an equidistant territorial sea throughout Dixon Entrance.&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; This territory, which surrounds Nunez Rocks, extends south of the "A-B" line for the most part.&lt;ref name="IBRU"/&gt; The United States has not ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea Treaty]], although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.

Another disputed area is the Grey Zone, including [[Machias Seal Island]], in the Gulf of Maine.

The [[Aroostook Valley Country Club]] is a [[golf course]] which straddles the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]], between the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[New Brunswick]]. The club, located near [[Perth-Andover]], New Brunswick and [[Fort Fairfield, Maine]], has its course (except part of the tee area for the ninth hole, and possibly part of a sand trap on the first hole) and clubhouse on the Canadian side of the border and its parking lot and pro shop on the American side.&lt;ref name="clui"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clui.org/section/united-divide-a-linear-portrait-usacanada-border-0 |title=Chapter 1: Eastern Maine |website=United Divide: A Linear Portrait of the USA/Canada Border |publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation |publication-date=Winter 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[East Richford–Glen Sutton Border Crossing|East Richford]] Slide Road in the US state of [[Vermont]] crosses in to the Canadian province of [[Québec]] for a distance of approximately 100 meters (300 feet) before returning to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/maps/place/E+Richford+Slide+Rd,+Richford,+VT+05476/@45.0112337,-72.5815797,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4cb604df404aca4f:0x330ba65efe040f37 Google Maps]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
In [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]], shifts in the course of the lower Rio Grande have created numerous [[wikt:pene-exclave|pene-exclave]]s. Under the [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] and earlier treaties, the United States and Mexico have maintained the actual course of the river as the international boundary, but both must approve proposed changes. From 1989 to 2009, there were 128 locations where the river changed course, causing land that had been on one side of the river to then occupy the opposite bank. Until the boundary is officially changed, there are 60 small pene-exclaves of the state of [[Texas]] now lying on the southern side of the river, as well as 68 such pene-exclaves of Mexico on the northern side of the river.

=== Russia ===
The legal status of the [[USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement|US-Russian border]] is unclear. The United States Senate ratified a treaty setting the boundary with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. However, shortly after, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the [[Russian parliament]] never voted on the treaty.

=== Cuba ===
The boundary between the United States and Cuba is a maritime boundary along the [[Straits of Florida]]. Despite tense relations between the countries, the United States operates a military base in Cuba, [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]]. The land on which this military base sits is not sovereign United States territory; rather, it is leased from the Cuban Government.

==States==

=== Separated by the water ===

*[[Rosecrans Memorial Airport]], though lying within the city limits of [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], is inaccessible by land from Missouri due to a change in the course of the [[Missouri River]] following the [[Great Flood of 1951]]. It is accessible only by crossing the river, then turning north through [[Elwood, Kansas]].
*[[Delaware]] has two [[exclaves]] of land on the [[New Jersey]] side of [[Delaware Bay]] northwest of [[Fort Mott (New Jersey)|Fort Mott State Park]] and [[Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge]]: [[Finns Point]] and [[Artificial Island, Delaware]] near the [[Salem Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. At that point, the border runs along New Jersey's mean [[Low-tide elevation|low-tide mark]]. Thus when the spoils from the navigational [[dredging]] of the bay were dumped alongside Fort Mott and the Salem plant excavations nearby, both sites became part of [[New Castle County, Delaware]].
*Iowa's city of [[Carter Lake, Iowa|Carter Lake]] on the Nebraska side of the Missouri River.
*Several small areas of western Kentucky lie north of the [[Ohio River]] on what is otherwise the Indiana side, including one area south of [[Evansville, Indiana]] that accommodates [[Ellis Park Race Course|a horse racing track]].
*Several portions of Nebraska lie east of the [[Missouri River]], mainly due to flooding and changes in the river's path:
**[[DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge]] near Blair, which borders Iowa. A portion of Iowa is also on the Nebraska side in the same area.
**[[McKissick Island]] near Peru, which borders Missouri.
**A section of land that borders Iowa, [[Sloan, Iowa|Sloan]].
**Onawa Materials Yard Wildlife Area and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Management Area near [[Onawa, Iowa]].
*[[Newport County, Rhode Island]] is separated from the rest of the state by the delta of the [[Taunton River]]. The only land connection is through [[Massachusetts]]
*The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is separated by the Chesapeake Bay from the rest of the Commonwealth.
*Divided coastal islands:
** Rhode Island and Connecticut share [[Sandy Point Island]] in [[Little Narragansett Bay]].
** New Jersey and New York share [[Shooter's Island]], a bird sanctuary located in the south end of [[Newark Bay]] off the north shore of [[Staten Island]]. (The small portion in New Jersey is further divided between two counties.)
** Delaware and Maryland share [[Fenwick Island (Delaware–Maryland)|Fenwick Island]].
** Maryland and Virginia share [[Smith Island, Maryland|Smith Island]] in [[Chesapeake Bay]], as well as [[Assateague Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Virginia and North Carolina share [[Knotts Island, North Carolina|Knotts Island]], [[Mon Island, North Carolina|Mon Island]] and [[Simon Island, Virginia|Simon Island]], separated from the Atlantic by an intracoastal waterway.
** North Carolina and South Carolina share [[Bird Island, North Carolina|Bird Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Florida and Alabama share [[Perdido Key]] in the Gulf of Mexico.
** Alabama and Mississippi share [[South Rigolets Island]] in the Gulf of Mexico.
** Alabama and Mississippi share an island between [[Bayou Heron]] and [[Mattie Clark Bayou]] on the Gulf Coast.
** Minnesota and Wisconsin share [[Interstate Island]] State Wildlife Management Area in [[Saint Louis River|Saint Louis Bay]] between Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin.
** Michigan and Ohio share [[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]] in Lake Erie.
** At the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], Oregon and Washington share [[Sand Island (Oregon)|Sand Island Dike]] and [[Rice Island (Oregon)|Rice Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fws.gov/pacific/planning/main/docs/WA/jbh-lc/Draft%20CCP%20EIS/2%20Chapter%202%20Alternatives%20Goals%20Objectives%20and%20Strategies.pdf|title=Lewis and Clark and Julia Butler Hansen National Wildlife Refuges Draft CCP/EIS Chapter 2.

==== Separated by the Mississippi River ====
These border irregularities were caused by changes in the [[Mississippi River]] during the [[1812 New Madrid earthquake]] or other river changes:

*Over a period of about 24 hours on 7 March 1876, the Mississippi River abandoned its former channel that defined the Tennessee-Arkansas border, and established a new channel east of Tennessee's [[Reverie, Tennessee|Reverie]] and [[Corona, Tennessee|Corona]], located in [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton County]] north-northwest of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/tipton | title = Tipton | work = Tennessee History for Kids | date = 2010-01-18 | publisher = Tennessee History for Kids | location = [[Nashville, Tennessee]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100706152404/http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/tipton | archivedate = 2010-07-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other irregularities involving the [[Mississippi River]]: 
*Arkansas has territory at {{coord|35.65|N|89.87|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}} across the Mississippi River on the northwest edge of Tennessee's [[Fort Pillow State Park]], north of the Corona/Reverie, Tennessee irregularity (mentioned in the previous section).
*Illinois's [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], Missouri's [[Grand Tower Island]] and other Illinois and Missouri territory on each other's side of the Mississippi River.
*The [[Kentucky Bend]] between Missouri and Tennessee.
*The state of [[Mississippi]] controls at least 11 exclaves on the west bank of the Mississippi River in [[Louisiana]], while Louisiana owns 8 exclaves on Mississippi's side.
*Louisiana and Mississippi also share 3 islands, at 31.754078 degrees north, 91.376270 west; 31.885015 north, 91.228315 west; as well as [[Middle Ground Island]], Togo Island, Davis Island at {{coord|32.13|N|91.05|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, an island at {{coord|32.371|N|90.889|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, Stack Island at {{coord|32.824|N|91.136|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, Cottonwood Island at {{coord|32.651|N|91.157|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, and an island at {{coord|32.674|N|91.147|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas share an island at their tri-point at {{coord|33.006|N|91.169|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*Mississippi also owns 14 exclaves on the bank in [[Arkansas]], while Arkansas has 15 of its own on Mississippi's side.
*Arkansas and Mississippi share islands at {{coord|34.895|N|90.268|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.229|N|90.847|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.829|N|90.431|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.177|N|90.885|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.732|N|91.142|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.142|N|91.092|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.129|N|91.136|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.235|N|91.098|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.358|N|91.118|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.393|N|91.106|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.408|N|91.124|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.498|N|91.176|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.569|N|91.171|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.757|N|91.117|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.247|N|90.922|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.297|N|90.743|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.679|N|90.566|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.847|N|90.388|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.888|N|90.284|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|35.025|N|90.252|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|35.039|N|90.208|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}} and {{coord|33.382|N|91.116|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*There are also many irregularities along the river between Arkansas/Tennessee, Missouri/Tennessee, and Missouri/Kentucky.

=== Other irregularities ===

*[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] is surrounded by the states of [[Virginia]] (on its southwest side) and [[Maryland]] (on its southeast, northeast, and northwest sides); it interrupts those states' common border, which is the south shore of the [[Potomac River]] both upstream and downstream from the District. The portion of the Potomac River that passes Washington is virtually entirely within the District's border, as the District extends to the south bank.
*The [[Wedge (border)|Delaware Wedge]] adjacent to Maryland and Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web | url = http://chriswhong.com/mdbounds/ | title = The Boundary Disputes of Colonial Maryland | first = Christopher M. | last = Whong | date = 2000-12-11 | location = [[Baltimore, Maryland]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Erie Triangle]].
*Michigan's [[Lost Peninsula]] Marina and neighboring [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]] north of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Washington Township, Lucas County, Ohio]]; resulting from [[Monroe County, Michigan#Border disputes|Toledo War border realignment]].
*Massachusetts's [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick Jog]].
*Missouri's [[Missouri Bootheel|Bootheel]].
*The above-water portion of [[Liberty Island]] is part of [[New York State]], but being located in [[New York Bay]], is entirely surrounded by the waters of [[New Jersey]]. Ellis Island is also in the waters of New Jersey, but the naturally formed part of the island belongs to New York, while the artificial infill portion surrounding it belongs to New Jersey. The original land area of Ellis Island is a true exclave of New York State.

==Highway system irregularities==
*[[Oklahoma State Highway 20]] forms a concurrency with [[Arkansas Highway 43]] between [[Maysville, Arkansas]] and the [[Missouri]] state line, where AR-43 becomes [[Missouri Highway 43]].
*[[Interstate 24]] briefly enters [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for a few miles but comes back into [[Tennessee]], and retains Tennessee exit numbers, but not Tennessee mile markers.
*[[Minnesota State Highway 23]] enters [[Wisconsin]] near [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] for half a mile.
*[[Interstate 684]], otherwise in New York, takes a shortcut across the northwest corner of the [[Connecticut Panhandle]] without any exits or signage save a standard Connecticut sign welcoming travelers to [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]].
*[[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]], formerly [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]], drops just south of the [[New York-Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] for two miles between [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly]] and [[Sayre, Pennsylvania|Sayre]]. The crossing is indicated by signs in both directions, but the New York signage and exit numbering remain (prior to being converted to an interstate, Route 17's sequential exit numbering began at its Pennsylvania terminus and continued into New York, one of the few highways in the U.S. where this was so; however, it is not uncommon for state highways to retain their route numbers when they change state highway shields at the border).
*[[New York State Route 120A]] runs along the Connecticut state line for much of its length, apart from 3.6 miles that enter the state, yet retains its New York signage and is still maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].
*Montana State Highway 43 runs for approximately one mile inside Idaho, between [[Chief Joseph Pass]] and [[Lost Trail Pass]]. It crosses into Montana again just yards from its junction with [[US 93]].
*The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carries [[I-95]] and [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]] (the Capitol Beltway) across the [[Potomac River]] south of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. It connects [[Maryland]] on the east shore of the river with [[Virginia]] on the west shore. However, a few hundred feet of roadway close to the Virginia side crosses the southernmost point of the District of Columbia and thus is in neither Maryland nor Virginia.
*13 miles of [[Pennsylvania Route 426]] goes through [[New York (state)|New York]], though unlike other state highways on the list that briefly enter other states with their normal symbols, this one is badged as [[New York State Route 426]] between both borders of [[Pennsylvania]].
*Highways [[U.S. Route 2|US-2]] and [[U.S. Route 141|US-141]] run in the state of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] twice nonconsecutively.

===Highway exclaves===
Some highways are not connected to the rest of their nominal highway systems:
*In addition to Alaska and Hawaii being separated from the [[Contiguous United States|Lower 48]], each has discontinuous road systems that are internally isolated. [[Alaska Route 7]] and the other roads near [[Juneau, Alaska]] remain separated by [[ferry]] from other road systems.
*[[Abbott Drive|Iowa Highway 165]] in Carter Lake, Iowa, is the only state highway in Iowa to be entirely west of the [[Missouri River]]. The highway is the middle span of the [[Omaha, Nebraska]] road named [[Abbott Drive]], and is not directly connected to any other street. The rest of Carter Lake is a separate street system exclave accessible only from Locust Street or Avenue H in Omaha.
*In [[Atchison County, Missouri]], [[Missouri supplemental route]] V is separated from the rest of Missouri's highway system. It connects only to roads in [[Fremont County, Iowa]]. This is due to lying northwest of the [[Nishnabotna River]].
*[[New York State Route 171]], near [[Utica, New York|Utica]], does not intersect any other state highways (it once did, with [[New York State Route 5S|NY 5S]], but a realignment of that route took it away from the one intersection that NY 171 had).
*[[New Jersey Route 324]] is an isolated route in [[Logan Township, New Jersey]] that connects to the former docks of a ferry on the [[Delaware River]] carrying [[US Route 322]] to [[Chester, Pennsylvania]]. The ferry was replaced by the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] in 1974. Route 324 used to connect to [[New Jersey Route 44]] at its eastern end prior to a realignment.
*A [[Pond Eddy Bridge|bridge]] connecting to [[Pond Eddy, Pennsylvania]] across the Delaware River to New York State is owned by Pennsylvania, despite having no connection to the rest of Pennsylvania's road network. One must use [[New York Route 97]] to cross back over the river at [[Narrowsburg, New York]] or [[Port Jervis, New York]], a distance of approximately {{convert|14|mi}}. When the original bridge needed replacement, Pennsylvania had considered buying out the property owners and demolishing the town and the bridge. (Bridges over the Delaware River between the two states are maintained by a joint commission&lt;!--The Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission is a compact between Pennsylvania and New Jersey. New York is not involved in it at all.--&gt; operated by the transportation departments of both states.)
*County Highway 330 services [[Angle Inlet, Minnesota]]. It does not connect to any U.S. highway, rather connecting to [[Manitoba Provincial Road 525|Provincial Road 525]] in [[Manitoba|Manitoba, Canada]].
*[[M-185 (Michigan highway)|M-185]] in [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|Mackinac Island]], [[Michigan]] serves as a beltway around the island, and is the only highway in the U.S. that bans cars and only allows runners and [[Cycling|bicyclists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mlive.com/expo/erry-2018/03/797a7e7b1b/a_guide_to_michigans_m185_the.html|title=A guide to Michigan's M-185, the only U.S. highway where cars are banned|work=MLive.com|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not connect to any other highway, and the only way to access it or the island are via [[ferry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mackinacisland.org/stay/getting-here/|title=Directions, Mackinac Island, MI - Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau|work=Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[St. Clair County, Michigan]], highway [[M-154 (Michigan highway)|M-154]] runs on [[Harsens Island]], although it does connect via ferry to nearby highway [[M-29 (Michigan highway)|M-29]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10760">'''Coastal sediment supply''' is the transport of [[sediment]] to the [[beach]] environment by both [[fluvial]] and [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] transport. While aeolian transport plays a role in the overall [[sedimentary budget]] for the coastal environment, it is paled in comparison to the fluvial supply which makes up 95% of sediment entering the ocean.&lt;ref name="Walling, 2006" /&gt;  When sediment reaches the coast it is then entrained by [[longshore drift]] and littoral cells until it is accreted upon the beach or dunes.
 
While it is acknowledged that storm systems are the driver behind [[coastal erosion]]. There is a general consensus that human activity, mainly dam and reservoir impoundments on rivers are the cause of indirect human related coastal erosion, along with other local scale effects such as: land use change, [[irrigation]], gravel extraction and river re-alignment.

== Rate of supply ==

Worldwide, rivers discharge approximately 35x10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of freshwater into the ocean annually. Transported in this freshwater is 15 to 20 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; tons of sediment.&lt;ref name="Milliman, 1995" /&gt;  This sediment load is not proportionally distributed across the worlds rivers, with Asian and Oceanic regions being among those most significantly affected by changing sediment regimes, as they account for 75% of this global sediment budget.

These changing rates of supply/replenishment from the fluvial environment are a dominant factor in controlling the rate of coastal erosion. While sediment supply is actually increasing, due to increased erosion rates, the supply of this sediment to the coastal environment is decreasing.

== Factors that influence sediment supply ==

Fluvial systems are key elements for operating Earth surface change because they convey most of the global fluxes of water and sediment from land to oceans. Human activities can affect the discharge of water and sediment from a river to the coastal environment in many ways. [[Deforestation]] and [[agriculture]], as well as [[urbanization]] can increase the erosion of a [[river basin]] by as much as an order of magnitude. Freshly exposed soil is much less likely to resist erosion by rainfall or moving water, especially in areas where land is often used for agriculture and precipitation is high.

Since the 1950s the number of dams in the world has increased more than sevenfold.&lt;ref name="Milliman, 1995" /&gt;  The creation of [[reservoir]]s has significantly reduced the sediment yield of many rivers as sediment that was entrained in the flow is stopped by a manmade barrier and the energy required to transport the material is lost, the sediment is no longer entrained as there is no flow or the flow is too slow.

Removal of water for irrigation reduces river flow and also plays its part in reducing the sediment carrying capacity of a river. Agricultural and farming practices often require intensive irrigation systems to achieve appropriate production levels. This creates a high demand on waterways as water is diverted and used to irrigate crops and pasture. This decreases the flow rate within the river system, which in turn lowers the sediment carrying capacity of the river as the energy within is less.&lt;ref name="Carter, 1987" /&gt;  Sediment is deposited along the reach of the river and takes much longer to reach the coastal zone if at all.

==Effects on the coast==

This changing coastal sediment supply regime leads to predominantly erosional outcomes but it is a case by case, river by river scenario. There are areas where the coastal sediment flux has increased and accretion of the shoreline has been evident. The effects of changing sediment flux can be very localised but pronounced, below are examples within the [[Bohai Sea]]. The [[Yellow River]] delta is undergoing an accretion phase while 200&amp;nbsp;km across the sea the Laun River area has experienced increased erosion rates along the coastline as a result of the changing sediment input.

===Accretion===

The Yellow River transports an order of magnitude more sediment than it did prior to widespread cultivation of the [[loess plateau]]s in northern [[China]], about 2400 years ago. One implication of this large increase in the sediment discharge of Asian rivers has been the increased shoreward accretion of some deltaic areas over the past several millennia.&lt;ref name="Milliman, 1995" /&gt;  The Yellow River Delta has accreted 100s of km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; over the past few decades. Building the coastline at a rate greater than sea level rise and depositing sediment faster than erosional processes can remove it. Mankind in Asia is occupying land areas that may not have existed if not for the increased upstream erosion and delivery of the sediment to the coastal environment.&lt;ref name="Chu, 2009" /&gt;

===Erosion===

Coastal erosion/retreat has wide-ranging implications for human habitat. With 45% of the world’s population living within 100&amp;nbsp;km of a coastline. The decline of sediment supply to the coast generally results in increased rates of erosion as there is no nourishment of the beach profile. Over time as storm systems ‘attack’ the coastline removing sediment to offshore bars or from the system altogether a real issue develops in how to slow the advancing ocean and protect coastal developments.

===Qinhuangadao coast===

Since the completion of construction of two large dams on the [[Luan River]] in 1979, its annual sediment delivery to the Bohai Sea has been cut from 20.2 million tons to an annual sediment flux of only 1.9 million tons. This sharp reduction in sediment discharge has been accompanied by phase shift of the Luan River Delta into para-abandonment. This drop in sediment yield has inevitably altered the longshore transport equilibrium in the local coastal area. With prevailing northward winds, shoreline retreat rates north of the Luan River have increased from 1&amp;nbsp;m/y to 3.7&amp;nbsp;m/y over twenty-year period since dam construction, rapidly changing the morphology and&lt;ref name="Zuo, 2009" /&gt; beach profile via positive feedback until a new equilibrium was reached, at which the present retreat is back at its original 1&amp;nbsp;m/y. With a longshore drift equilibrium was reached within a new state.

===Mississippi Delta===

The effects of changing sediment flux were a definite compounding factor in the havoc brought upon [[New Orleans]] in 2005 by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The [[Mississippi River Delta]] is slowly sinking due to natural compaction and its sediment supply from up river being greatly diminished by up to 50%, due to dam construction in the Mississippi Basin.&lt;ref name="Blum, 2009"/&gt;  The loss of sediment supply has resulted in  subsidence of the delta and wetland reduction. Fresh sediment is not deposited at a rate fast enough for vegetation to grow on as sea level rises.&lt;ref name="Houben, 2009" /&gt;  The brackish conditions that are essential for vegetation growth on the delta are no longer. These coastal wetlands are vital for the diverse wildlife habitat that lives among them, and for protecting developed areas from storm surges, like the one experienced during Katrina.

==Solutions==
===Beach nourishment===
This is a short term fix for a long term problem. It treats the immediate symptoms of coastal erosion by dumping of sand either just off shore or on the berm itself, It can be a costly and time consuming process as it requires upkeep on regular bases. While it may look aesthetically pleasing it does not fix the problem at hand, the beach has lost its source of natural nourishment. Artificial nourishment is an appropriate short term solution on small scale restoration projects.

===Management===
Humans are simultaneously increasing the availability of sediment for fluvial transportation through activities and practices that increase soil erosion, and decreasing this flux to the coastal environment through retention of sediment behind reservoir walls and decreasing river discharge rates. The net result is a global reduction in the overall sediment flux.&lt;ref name="Syvitski, 2005" /&gt;  This impact on coastal erosion will be further accelerated as the sea level rises, which is anticipated because of climate change. Given the modern levels of fluvial sediment loads, over 100 billion tons of sediment have been sequestered behind human-made reservoirs. This gives reason for the effects of changes in the upstream fluvial environment to be included into the [[Integrated coastal zone management]] framework. Planners and decision makers must consider what the impacts of upstream  development will have on the coastal environment. The management of the coastal zone must account for both the effect of human activities as well as the impacts resulting from corresponding changes in the coastal zone.

[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), with its provinces, in medieval times]]
'''''Diyār Bakr''''' ("abode of [[Banu Bakr|Bakr]]") is the medieval [[Arabic]] name of the northernmost of the three provinces of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), the other two being [[Diyar Mudar]] and [[Diyar Rabi'a]]. According to [[al-Baladhuri]], all three provinces were named after the main Arab tribes that were settled there by [[Mu'awiyah]] in the course of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century. The Diyar Bakr was settled by the [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] subgroup of the [[Banu Bakr]], and hence the two provinces are sometimes referred to collectively as "Diyar Rabi'a". In later Turkish usage, "Diyar Bakr" referred to the western portion of the former province, around Amid (which hence became known as [[Diyarbakır]] in Turkish).

Diyar Bakr encompasses the region on both banks of the upper course of the river [[Tigris]], from its sources to approximately where its course changes from a west-east to a southeasterly direction. Its main city was [[Amida (Mesopotamia)|Amida]] (Amid in Arabic), and other major settlements included [[Mayyafariqin]], [[Hasankeyf|Hisn Kaifa]], and [[Arzanene|Arzan]]. Geographically and politically, in early Islamic times the Diyar Bakr was usually part of the Jazira, but it was sometimes joined to the [[Emirate of Armenia|Armenian province]] to the north. In the late 9th century, it was controlled by an autonomous dynasty founded by [[Isa ibn al-Shaykh al-Shaybani]]. In the mid-10th century, the region passed into the hands of the [[Hamdanids]], but their rule was contested by the [[Buyids]] (978–983) and after that the [[Marwanids]]. The Marwanid emirate ruled the region for almost a century before being annexed by the [[Seljuq Empire]] in 1084–1085. Following the Seljuq realm's collapse after the death of [[Malik-Shah I]] in 1092, a series of small emirates established itself across the region, with the [[Artukids]] of [[Mardin]] the most important among them. In the late 12th century, the province came under [[Ayyubid]] control, and in the mid-13th century it was divided between the Ayyubids in the east and the [[Seljuqs of Rum]], who controlled the western portion around Amida. Around 1260, the region was conquered by the [[Mongols]], who allowed the local rulers to continue to exercise power as their vassals. In the 14th century, the region was conquered by the [[Ak Koyunlu]], who disputed control with the [[Kara Koyunlu]] and the last Ayyubid princes. In the early 16th century, it was for a time occupied by the [[Safavids]] before coming under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control in 1516.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Ecological imperialism''' is the theory advanced first by Alfred Crosby that European settlers were successful in colonization of other regions because of their accidental or deliberate introduction of animals, plants, and disease leading to major shifts in the ecology of the colonized areas and to population collapses in the endemic peoples. The many [[pathogen]]s they carried with them adversely affected the [[native populations]] of North America, Australia, and Africa, and were far more destructive than weaponry: it is estimated that disease wiped out up to 90 percent of indigenous people in some locations.&lt;ref&gt;D. N. Cook, Demographic Collapse: Indian Peru 1520-1620 (Cambridge, 1981), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cortes and the Aztecs==
In the early 16th century, Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] led an expedition to what is now Mexico, which resulted in the total destruction of the [[Aztec Empire]] within just two years (February 1519 – August 1521). Notwithstanding the Europeans' superior weaponry and [[Horses]], it is believed {{by who?|date=December 2016}} that the arrival of [[smallpox]] in the Americas in 1520 weakened the resistance the Aztecs people were able to mount.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

=="The New World"==
In 1607, English settlers arrived in North America and established the [[Jamestown colony]] in Virginia. Though at first it seemed the colonists would not survive the harsh conditions of the [[New World]], ultimately it was the natives who could not survive the diseases of the Old World. "The colonizers brought along plants and animals new to the Americas, some by design and others by accident. Determined to farm in a European manner, the colonists introduced their domesticated livestock—honeybees, pigs, horses, mules, sheep, and cattle—and their domesticated plants, including wheat, barley, rye, oats, grasses, and grapevines. But the colonists also inadvertently carried pathogens, weeds, and rats."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Taylor, American Colonies (Penguin Books: 2002), 280-300.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of these foreign species upset the balance of native species and severely hurt the way of life of the native population. 

The first major smallpox outbreak among natives was between 1616 and 1619 in Massachusetts. Native Americans had never seen a disease like this, and it wiped out entire settlements in nations such as the [[Abenaki]], the [[Pawtucket tribe|Pawtucket]], and the [[Wampanoag]]. "By wiping out the Indians, smallpox helped the colonists help themselves to land and resources formerly controlled by unfriendly native people. The Europeans could and did colonize virtually unchallenged in some areas." In 1633 there was another devastating epidemic. William Bradford, governor of the Plymouth Colony, observed that: "They lye on their hard matts, ye pox breaking and muttering, and running one into another, their skin cleaving (by reason thereof) to the matts they lye on; when they turn them, a whole side with flea off at once...and they will be all of a gore blood, most fearful to behold. Then being very sore, what with cold and other distempers, they dye like rotten sheep."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie True Peters, Epidemic! Smallpox in the New World (Benchmark Books, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Syphilis was also extremely devastating, and ran rampant when brought back to the Old World.

==Fur trade==
The fur trade was as detrimental to the survival of native people as it was imperative to the success of settlers due the high European demand. Trappers employed natives because of their knowledge of the terrain and wildlife, putting natives with no immunity to European diseases into close contact with Europeans.

The fur trade also upset the ecological balance of North America. "Restraint wasn't a hallmark of the fur trade. In 1822, in the north western regions of the country alone, the Hudson's Bay Company stockpiled 1500 fox skins, a paltry number compared with the 106,000 beaver skins, but too many none the less. The fur traders had miscalculated. As predators, they had failed to adapt to their prey, and their prey, in turn, retaliated with denial. Of course, the red fox didn't render himself extinct. His numbers merely shrank.".&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Kirsch, What Species of Creatures (New Star Books: 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ecological Imperialism: The Expansion of Europe 900-1900'', by Alfred Crosby==
{{main|Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900}}
Historian and professor Alfred Crosby wrote ''[[Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900]]'' in 1986. He uses the term "Neo-Europes" to describe the places colonized and conquered by Europeans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3341">'''GPS meteorology''' refers to the use of the effect of the atmosphere on the
propagation of the Global Positioning System's ([[GPS]]) radio signals to derive
information on the state of the (lower, neutral) atmosphere.

There are currently two main operational techniques in use in GPS meteorology:
GPS limb sounding from orbit, and GPS water vapour monitoring.

== Ground-based ==
As a result, if it is possible to determine the total atmospheric delay by GPS,
one can subtract out the calculated contribution by the well-mixed "dry" gasses
from the measured air pressure at the surface, and obtain a measure for the
absolute water vapour content of the atmosphere, integrated from surface to
space. This is also referred to as "total precipitable water vapour".

What makes it possible to determine the total atmospheric delay, is its known
dependence of the [[zenith]] or [[elevation]] angle of the satellite. If &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;
is the zenith angle, the propagation path delay is proportional to
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\cos z}&lt;/math&gt;. This unique signature makes it possible to solve
separately for the ''zenith delay'' in GPS computations also solving for
station coordinates and receiver clock delays.

Nowadays water vapour estimates are generated routinely in real time (latency
measured in hours) by permanent [[geodesy|geodetic]] GPS networks existing in
many parts of the world.

Water vapour is a very important gas for meteorological and climatological
studies, because of the [[latent heat]] it carries in transport. Additionally
it is a powerful greenhouse gas.  The GPS technique is especially valuable
because it measures ''absolute'' water vapour content or partial pressure
rather than relative humidity, which corresponds to water vapour contents that
are strongly dependent on the often not precisely known temperature.

== Space-based ==
{{main|Radio occultation#GNSS radio occultation}}
One can receive on a low flying satellite the signals from the much higher
orbiting (20 000 km) GPS satellite constellation. As the low flying satellite
orbits the Earth in 1.5 hours, many of the GPS satellites will "rise" and "set"
during the time of the orbit. When they do, their signal will traverse the atmosphere.

A signal delay is produced which grows or decays exponentially with time, just
as the atmospheric density is an exponential function of height above the
Earth's surface. In fact, this so-called [[limb sounding]] technique allows
us to determine the [[scale height]], the constant describing the steepness of
this atmospheric density decay. This makes the technique extremely valuable for
climatological studies, as the scale height is directly related to the
temperature in the upper atmosphere, where the limb sounding signals do their
sensing. The technique works best in the lower stratosphere and upper
troposphere; it breaks down close to the Earth surface especially in the
tropics, due to water vapour extinction.

Satellites involved in GPS limb sounding have been: METSAT, OERSTED (Danish),
and several others.

Kitchener was credited in 1898 for winning the [[Battle of Omdurman]] and securing control of the [[Sudan]] for which he was [[ennoblement|made]] [[Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] [[territorial designation|of Khartoum]], becoming a [[House of Lords|qualifying peer]] and of mid-rank as an [[Earl]]. As Chief of Staff (1900–1902) in the [[Second Boer War]] he played a key role in [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts']] conquest of the Boer Republics, then succeeded Roberts as commander-in-chief&amp;nbsp;– by which time [[Boer]] forces had taken to guerrilla fighting and British forces imprisoned Boer civilians in [[concentration camps]]. His term as [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Commander-in-Chief]] (1902–09) of the Army in India saw him quarrel with another eminent [[proconsul]], the Viceroy [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], who eventually resigned. Kitchener then returned to [[Egypt]] as British Agent and Consul-General (''de facto'' administrator).

In 1914, at the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], Kitchener became [[Secretary of State for War]], a Cabinet Minister. One of the few to foresee a long war, lasting for at least three years, and with the authority to act effectively on that perception, he organised the largest [[Kitchener's Army|volunteer army]] that Britain had seen, and oversaw a significant expansion of materials production to fight on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Despite having warned of the difficulty of provisioning for a long war, he was blamed for the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shortage of shells]] in the spring of 1915&amp;nbsp;– one of the events leading to the formation of a coalition government&amp;nbsp;– and stripped of his control over munitions and strategy.

On 5 June 1916, Kitchener was making his way to [[Russia]] to attend negotiations, on [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS ''Hampshire'']], when it struck a German mine {{convert|1.5|mi}} west of the [[Orkney Islands]], [[Scotland]], and sank. Kitchener was among 737 who died.

Kitchener was born in [[Ballylongford]] near [[Listowel]], [[County Kerry]], in [[Ireland]], son of army officer Henry Horatio Kitchener (1805–1894) and Frances Anne Chevallier (d. 1864; daughter of [[Chevalliers of Aspall Hall|John Chevallier]], a priest, of Aspall Hall, and his third wife, Elizabeth, ''née'' Cole).&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB |id=34341 |title=Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had only recently bought land in Ireland, under a scheme to encourage the purchase of land, after selling his commission.&lt;ref name=heath192&gt;Heathcote 1999, p192&lt;/ref&gt; They then moved to [[Switzerland]] where the young Kitchener was educated at [[Montreux]], then at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]].&lt;ref name=heath192/&gt; Pro-French and eager to see action, he joined a [[France|French]] field ambulance unit in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name=heath192/&gt; His father took him back to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] after he caught [[pneumonia]] while ascending in a balloon to see the French [[Army of the Loire]] in action.&lt;ref name=heath192/&gt; Commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] on 4 January 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=23694|page=38|date=6 January 1871}}&lt;/ref&gt; his service in France had violated British neutrality, and he was reprimanded by the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the commander-in-chief.&lt;ref name=heath192/&gt; He served in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Egypt]] and [[Cyprus]] as a surveyor, learned [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and prepared detailed topographical maps of the areas.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; His brother, Lt. Gen. [[Walter Kitchener|Sir Walter Kitchener]], had also entered the army, and was [[Governor of Bermuda]] from 1908 to 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Brother of Kitchener passes in Bermuda| newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Constitution]]| page =29| date =8 March 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survey of western Palestine ==
In 1874, aged 24, Kitchener was assigned by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] to a mapping-survey of the [[Holy Land]], replacing Charles Tyrwhitt-Drake, who had died of malaria.&lt;ref name=Silberman&gt;Silberman 1982, pp.121–122&lt;/ref&gt; By then an officer in the [[Royal Engineers]], Kitchener joined fellow officer [[Claude R. Conder]]; between 1874 and 1877 they surveyed Palestine, returning to [[England]] only briefly in 1875 after an attack by locals at [[Safed]], in [[Galilee]].&lt;ref name=Silberman/&gt;

Conder and Kitchener's expedition became known as the [[Survey of Western Palestine]] because it was largely confined to the area west of the [[Jordan River]]. The survey collected data on the topography and toponymy of the area, as well as local flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1885, p199-222&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the survey were published in an eight-volume series, with Kitchener's contribution in the first three tomes (Conder and Kitchener 1881–1885). This survey has had a lasting effect on the [[Middle East]] for several reasons:
* It serves as the basis for the [[Palestine grid|grid system]] used in the modern maps of [[Israel]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]];
* The data compiled by Conder and Kitchener are still consulted by archaeologists and geographers working in the southern [[Levant]];
* The survey itself effectively delineated and defined the political borders of the southern Levant. For example, the modern border between [[Israel]] and [[Lebanon]] is established at the point in [[Galilee|upper Galilee]] where Conder and Kitchener's survey stopped.&lt;ref name=Silberman/&gt;

In 1878, having completed the survey of western Palestine, Kitchener was sent to [[Cyprus]] to undertake a survey of that newly acquired British protectorate.&lt;ref name=heath192/&gt; He became vice-consul in [[Anatolia]] in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24741|page=4338|date=8 July 1879|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Egypt ==
Kitchener was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in 1883 in the Italian-speaking La Concordia Lodge No. 1226, which met in Cairo.  &lt;ref&gt;Pollock 2001, p54&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1899 he was appointed the first District Grand Master of the District Grand Lodge of Egypt and the Sudan, under the [[United Grand Lodge of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorothe Sommer, '' Freemasonry in the Ottoman Empire'', I. B. Tauris, Londra-New-York, 2015, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kitchener of Khartoum: Mason extraordinary|url=http://www.mqmagazine.co.uk/issue-12/p-07.php|publisher=MQ Magazine|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 1883 Kitchener was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25184|page=31|date=2 January 1883|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the Turkish rank [[binbashi|bimbashi]] (major), and dispatched to [[Egypt]] where he took part in the reconstruction of the Egyptian Army.&lt;ref name=heath192/&gt;

Egypt had recently become a British puppet state, its army led by British officers, although still nominally under the sovereignty of the Khedive (Egyptian monarch) and his nominal overlord the (Ottoman) Sultan of Turkey. Kitchener became second-in-command of an Egyptian cavalry regiment&lt;ref&gt;Faught, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; in February 1883, and then took part in the failed expedition to relieve [[Charles George Gordon]] in the [[Sudan]] in late 1884.&lt;ref name=heath192/&gt; Fluent in Arabic, Kitchener preferred the company of the Egyptians over the British, and the company of no-one over the Egyptians, writing in 1884 that: "I have become such a solitary bird that I often think I were happier alone".&lt;ref&gt;Urban p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener spoke Arabic so well that he was able to effortlessly adopt the dialects of the different Bedouin tribes of Egypt and the Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;Urban p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to brevet [[major]] on 8 October 1884&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25402|page=4373|date=7 October 1884|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to brevet [[lieutenant-colonel]] on 15 June 1885,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25505|page=4052|date=25 August 1885|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became the British member of the [[Zanzibar]] boundary commission in July 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25527|page=5080|date=6 November 1885|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became Governor of the Egyptian Provinces of Eastern Sudan and Red Sea Littoral (which in practice consisted of little more than the Port of [[Suakin]]) in September 1886, and led his forces in action against the followers of [[Muhammad Ahmad|the Mahdi]] at Handub in January 1888, when he was injured in the jaw.&lt;ref name=heath193&gt;Heathcote 1999, p193&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener was promoted to brevet [[colonel]] on 11 April 1888&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25806|page=2070|date=10 April 1888|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the substantive rank of major on 20 July 1889&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25963|page=4319|date=9 August 1889|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led the Egyptian cavalry at the [[Battle of Toski]] in August 1889. At the beginning of 1890 he was appointed Inspector General of the Egyptian police&lt;ref&gt;Faught, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to the position of Adjutant-General of the Egyptian Army in December of the same year&lt;ref name=heath193/&gt; and [[Sirdar]] (Commander-in-Chief) of the Egyptian Army with the local rank of brigadier in April 1892.&lt;ref name=heath193/&gt;

Kitchener was worried that, although his moustache was bleached white by the sun, his blond hair refused to turn grey, making it harder for Egyptians to take him seriously. His appearance added to his mystique: his long legs made him appear taller, whilst a cast in his eye made people feel he was looking right through them.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p78"&gt;Reid 2006, p78&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener, at 6'2", towered over most of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren 1978, p11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Sir Evelyn Baring]], the ''de facto'' British ruler of Egypt, thought Kitchener “the most able (soldier) I have come across in my time”.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman 1962, p193&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, a [[War Office]] evaluation of Kitchener concluded: "A good brigadier, very ambitious, not popular, but has of late greatly improved in tact and manner...a fine gallant soldier and good linguist and very successful in dealing with Orientals" [in the 19th century, Europeans called the Middle East the Orient].&lt;ref&gt;Urban p.188-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sudan and Khartoum ==
{{see also|Anglo-Egyptian invasion of Sudan}}
[[File:General Kitchener and the Anglo-egyptian Nile Campaign, 1898 HU93828.jpg|thumb|Kitchener, Commander of the Egyptian Army (centre right), 1898]] In 1896, the British Prime Minister, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], was concerned with keeping France out of the [[Horn of Africa]]. A French expedition under the command of [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] had left [[Dakar]] in March 1896 with the aim of conquering the Sudan, seizing control of the Nile as it flowed into Egypt, and forcing the British out of Egypt; thus restoring Egypt to the place within the French sphere of influence that it had had prior to 1882. Salisbury feared that if the British did not conquer the Sudan, the French would.&lt;ref name=urban194/&gt; He had supported Italy's ambitions to conquer Ethiopia in the hope that the Italians would keep the French out of Ethiopia. The Italian attempt to conquer Ethiopia, however, was going very badly by early 1896, and ended with the Italians being annihilated at the [[Battle of Adowa]] in March 1896.&lt;ref name=urban187&gt;Urban, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1896, with the Italians visibly failing and the [[Muhammad Ahmad|''Mahdiyah'' state]] threatening to conquer Eritrea, Salisbury ordered Kitchener to invade northern Sudan, ostensibly for the purpose of distracting [[Ansar (Sudan)|the ''Ansar'']] (whom the British called "Dervishes") from attacking the Italians.&lt;ref name=urban187/&gt;

Kitchener won victories at the [[Battle of Ferkeh]] in June 1896 and the Battle of Hafir in September 1896, earning him national fame in the United Kingdom and promotion to [[major-general]] on 25 September 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26781|page=5379|date=29 September 1896|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener's cold personality and his tendency to drive his men hard made him widely disliked by his fellow officers.&lt;ref&gt;Urban p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; One officer wrote about Kitchener in September 1896: "He was always inclined to bully his own entourage, as some men are rude to their wives. He was inclined to let off his spleen on those around him. He was often morose and silent for hours together...he was even morbidly afraid of showing any feeling or enthusiasm, and he preferred to be misunderstood rather than be suspected of human feeling."&lt;ref&gt;Urban. p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener had served on the [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Wolseley]] expedition to rescue General Gordon at Khartoum, and was convinced that the expedition failed because Wolseley had used boats coming up the Nile to bring his supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener wanted to build a railroad to supply the Anglo-Egyptian army, and assigned the task of constructing the [[Sudan Military Railroad]] to a Canadian railroad builder, [[Percy Girouard]], for whom he had specifically asked.&lt;ref&gt;Pigott, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener achieved further successes at the [[Battle of Atbara]] in April 1898, and then the [[Battle of Omdurman]] in September 1898.&lt;ref name=heath193/&gt; After marching to the walls of Khartoum, he placed his army into a crescent shape with the Nile to the rear, together with the gunboats in support. This enabled him to bring overwhelming firepower against any attack of the ''Ansar'' from any direction, though with the disadvantage of having his men spread out thinly, with hardly any forces in reserve. Such an arrangement could have proven disastrous if the ''Ansar'' had broken through the thin khaki line.&lt;ref&gt;Urban. page 189&lt;/ref&gt; At about 5 a.m. on 2 September 1898, a huge force of ''Ansar'', under the command of the Khalifa himself, came out of the fort at Omdurman, marching under their black banners inscribed with Koranic quotations in Arabic; this led Bennet Burleigh, the Sudan correspondent of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', to write: "It was not alone the reverberation of the tread of horses and men's feet I heard and seemed to feel as well as hear, but a voiced continuous shouting and chanting-the Dervish invocation and battle challenge "Allah e Allah Rasool Allah el Mahdi!" they reiterated in vociferous rising measure, as they swept over the intervening ground".&lt;ref&gt;Urban p. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener had the ground carefully studied so that his officers would know the best angle of fire, and had his army open fire on the ''Ansar'' first with artillery, then machine guns and finally rifles as the enemy advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Urban p.191-192&lt;/ref&gt; A young [[Winston Churchill]], serving as an army officer, wrote of what he saw: "A ragged line of men were coming on desperately, struggling forward in the face of the pitiless fire-black banners tossing and collapsing; white figures subsiding in dozens to the ground...valiant men were struggling on through a hell of whistling metal, exploding shells, and spurting dust—suffering, despairing, dying".&lt;ref&gt;Urban p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; By about 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., much of the Dervish army was dead; Kitchener ordered his men to advance, fearing that the Khalifa might escape with what was left of his army to the fort of Omdurman, forcing Kitchener to lay siege to it.&lt;ref name="Urban p.192"&gt;Urban p.192&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing the battlefield from horseback on the hill at Jebel Surgham, Kitchener commented: "Well, we have given them a damn good dusting".&lt;ref name="Urban p.192"/&gt; As the British and Egyptians advanced in columns, the Khalifa attempted to outflank and encircle the columns; this led to desperate hand-to-hand fighting. Churchill wrote of his own experience as the 21st Lancers cut their way through the ''Ansar'': "The collision was prodigious and for perhaps ten wonderful seconds, no man heeded his enemy. Terrified horses wedged in the crowd, bruised and shaken men, sprawling in heaps, struggle dazed and stupid, to their feet, panted and looked about them".&lt;ref name="Urban p.193"&gt;Urban p.193&lt;/ref&gt; The Lancers' onslaught carried them through the 12-men-deep ''Ansar'' line  with the Lancers losing about 70 dead while killing hundreds of the enemy.&lt;ref name="Urban p.193"/&gt; Following the annihilation of his army, the Khalifa ordered a retreat and early in the afternoon, Kitchener rode in triumph into Omdurman and immediately ordered that the thousands of Christians enslaved by the ''Ansar'' were now all free people.&lt;ref name="Urban p. 193"&gt;Urban p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener lost fewer than 500 men while killing about 11,000 and wounding 17,000 of the ''Ansar''.&lt;ref name="Urban p. 193"/&gt; Burleigh summed the general mood of the British troops: "At Last! Gordon has been avenged and justified. The dervishes have been overwhelming routed, Mahdism has been "smashed", while the Khalifa's capital of Omdurman has been stripped of its barbaric halo of sanctity and invulnerability."&lt;ref name="Urban p. 193"/&gt; Kitchener promptly had the Mahdi's tomb blown up and his bones scattered.&lt;ref name="urban195"/&gt; Queen Victoria, who had wept when she heard of General Gordon's death, now wept for the man who had vanquished Gordon, asking whether it had been really necessary for Kitchener to desecrate the Mahdi's tomb.&lt;ref name="urban195"/&gt; In a letter to his mother, Churchill wrote that the victory at Omdurman had been "disgraced by the inhuman slaughter of the wounded and...Kitchener is responsible for this".&lt;ref&gt;Urban p.193-194&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that Kitchener ordered his men to shoot the wounded ''Ansar'' on the field of Omdurman, but he did give before the battle what the British journalist [[Mark Urban]] called a "mixed message", saying that mercy should be given, while at the same time saying "Remember Gordon" and that the enemy were all "murderers" of Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;Urban p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The victory at Omdurman made Kitchener into a popular war hero, and gave him a reputation for efficiency and as a man who got things done.&lt;ref name="urban195"/&gt; The journalist [[G. W. Steevens]] wrote in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that "He [Kitchener] is more like a machine than a man. You feel that he ought to be patented and shown with pride at the Paris International Exhibition. British Empire: Exhibit No. 1 ''hors concours'', the Sudan Machine".&lt;ref name=urban195&gt;Urban p.195&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting of the wounded at Omdurman, along with the desecration of the Mahdi's tomb, gave Kitchener a reputation for brutality that was to dog him for the rest of his life, and posthumously.&lt;ref name=urban195&gt;Urban p.195&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
After Omdurman, Kitchener opened a special sealed letter from Salisbury that told him that Salisbury's real reason for ordering the conquest of the Sudan was to prevent France from moving into the Sudan, and that the talk of "avenging Gordon" had been just a pretext.&lt;ref name=urban194&gt;Urban, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Salisbury's letter ordered Kitchener to head south as soon as possible to evict Marchand before he got a chance to become well-established on the Nile.&lt;ref name=urban194/&gt; On 18 September 1898, Kitchener arrived at the French fort at Fashoda and informed Marchand that he and his men had to leave the Sudan at once, a request Merchand refused, leading to a tense stand-off as French and British soldiers aimed their weapons at each other.&lt;ref name=urban194/&gt; During what became known as the [[Fashoda Incident]], Britain and France almost went to war with each other.&lt;ref name="The Fashoda Incident"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ibatpv.org/projects/scramble/fashoda.htm |title=The Fashoda Incident |publisher=Silver Pages |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194554/http://ibatpv.org/projects/scramble/fashoda.htm |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fashoda incident caused much jingoism and chauvinism on both sides of the [[English Channel]]; however, at Fashoda itself, despite the stand-off with the French, Kitchener established cordial relations with Marchand. They agreed that the tricolor would fly equally with the Union Jack and the Egyptian flag over the disputed fort at Fashoda.&lt;ref name="The Fashoda Incident" /&gt; Kitchener was a [[Francophile]] who spoke fluent French, and despite his reputation for brusque rudeness was very diplomatic and tactful in his talks with Marchand; for example, congratulating him on his achievement in crossing the Sahara in an epic trek from Dakar to the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;Massie p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1898, the crisis ended when the French agreed to withdraw from the Sudan.&lt;ref name=urban195/&gt; Several factors persuaded the French to back down. These included British naval superiority; the prospect of an Anglo-French war leading to the British gobbling up the entire French colonial empire after the defeat of the [[French Navy]]; the pointed statement from the Russian Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] that the Franco-Russian alliance applied only to Europe, and that Russia would not go to war against Britain for the sake of an obscure fort in the Sudan in which no Russian interests were involved; and the possibility that Germany might take advantage of an Anglo-French war to strike France.&lt;ref&gt;Massie p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener became [[List of governors of pre-independence Sudan|Governor-General of the Sudan]] in September 1898, and began a programme of restoring good governance. The programme had a strong foundation, based on education at [[Gordon Memorial College]] as its centrepiece—and not simply for the children of the local elites, for children from anywhere could apply to study. He ordered the [[mosque]]s of Khartoum rebuilt, instituted reforms which recognised Friday—the Muslim holy day—as the official day of rest, and guaranteed freedom of religion to all citizens of the Sudan. He attempted to prevent evangelical Christian missionaries from trying to convert Muslims to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Korieah 2007, p206&lt;/ref&gt;

At this stage of his career Kitchener was keen to exploit the press, cultivating G. W. Steevens of the ''Daily Mail'' who wrote a book ''With Kitchener to Khartum''. Later, as his legend had grown, he was able to be rude to the press, on one occasion in the Second Boer War bellowing: "Get out of my way, you drunken swabs".&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p78"/&gt; He was created '''Baron Kitchener''', of [[Khartoum]] and of [[Aspall, Suffolk|Aspall in the County of Suffolk]], on 31 October 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27019|page=6375|date=1 November 1898|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anglo-Boer War ==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 102586 Lord Herbert Kichener on horseback..jpg|thumb|Lord Kitchener on horseback in ''The Queenslander Pictorial'' in 1910]]
During the [[Second Boer War]], Kitchener arrived in South Africa with [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] on the RMS ''[[RMS Dunottar Castle|Dunottar Castle]]'' along with massive British reinforcements in December 1899.&lt;ref name=heath193/&gt; Officially holding the title of chief of staff,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27146|page=8541|date=22 December 1899|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was in practice a second-in-command and was present at the [[relief of Kimberley]] before leading an unsuccessful frontal assault at the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] in February 1900.&lt;ref name=heath193/&gt; Kitchener was [[Mentioned in Despatches|mentioned in despatches]] from Lord Roberts several times during the early part of the war; in a despatch from March 1900 Lord Roberts wrote how he was "greatly indebted to him for his counsel and cordial support on all occasions".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27282 |page=844 |date=8 February 1901 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the defeat of the conventional [[Boer]] forces, Kitchener succeeded Roberts as overall commander in November 1900.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27256|page=8459|date=14 December 1900|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also promoted to [[lieutenant-general]] on 29 November 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27253|page=8217|date=4 December 1900|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to local [[general]] on 12 December 1900.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He subsequently inherited and expanded the successful strategies devised by Roberts to force the Boer [[commandos]] to submit, including concentration camps and the burning of farms.&lt;ref name=heath193/&gt; Conditions in the [[British concentration camps|concentration camps]], which had been conceived by Roberts as a form of control of the families whose farms he had destroyed, began to degenerate rapidly as the large influx of Boers outstripped the ability of the minuscule British force to cope. The camps lacked space, food, sanitation, medicine, and medical care, leading to rampant disease and a very high death rate for those Boers who entered. Eventually 26,370 women and children (81% were children) died in the concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/concentration-camps/camps2.php |title=Concentration Camps |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825180514/http://www.anglo-boer.co.za/concentration-camps/camps2.php |archive-date=25 August 2007 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest critic of the camps was the Englishwoman, humanitarian, and welfare worker [[Emily Hobhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/19/guardian190-south-africa-concentration-camps|title=19 June 1901: The South African concentration camps|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 July 2013|location=London|first=Research|last=Department|date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Vereeniging]], ending the War, was signed in May 1902 following a tense six months. During this period Kitchener struggled against [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Sir Alfred Milner]], the Governor of the [[Cape Colony]], and the British government. Milner was a hard-line conservative and wanted forcibly to Anglicise the Afrikaans people (the Boers), and Milner and the British government wanted to assert victory by forcing the Boers to sign a humiliating peace treaty; Kitchener wanted a more generous compromise peace treaty that would recognize certain rights for the Afrikaners and promise future self-government. He even entertained a peace treaty proposed by [[Louis Botha]] and the other Boer leaders, although he knew the British government would reject the offer; this would have maintained the sovereignty of the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]] while requiring them to sign a perpetual treaty of alliance with the UK and grant major concessions to the British, such as equal rights for English with Dutch in their countries, voting rights for Uitlanders, and a customs and railway union with the [[Cape Colony]] and [[Colony of Natal|Natal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27529/27529-h/27529-h.htm |title=The Peace Negotiations| first1= J.

Kitchener, who had been promoted to the substantive rank of general on 1 June 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27441|page=3750|date=10 June 1902|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; was hosted to a farewell reception at Cape Town on 23 June, and left for the United Kingdom in the SS ''Orotava'' on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence – The Peace, Lord Kitchener at Cape Town |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=24 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36802| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an enthusiastic welcome on his arrival the following month. Landing in [[Southampton]] on 12 July, he was greeted by the corporation, who presented him with the [[Freedom of the borough]]. In London, he was met at the train station by [[George V|The Prince of Wales]], drove in a procession through streets lined by military personnel from 70 different units and watched by thousands of people, and received a formal welcome at [[St James's Palace]]. He also visited [[King Edward VII]], [[Emperor of India]], who was confined to his room recovering from his recent operation for [[appendicitis]], but wanted to meet the general on his arrival and to personally bestow on him the insignia of the [[Order of Merit]] (OM).&lt;ref name=TT14071902&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lord Kitchener′s return |day_of_week=Monday |date=14 July 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36819| }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener was created '''Viscount Kitchener''', of [[Khartoum]] and of [[Vaal River|the Vaal]] in the [[Colony of Transvaal]] and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk, on 28 July 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27459|page=4834|date=29 July 1902|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Breaker Morant case, five Australian officers and one English officer of an irregular unit, The [[Bushveldt Carbineers]], were [[court-martial]]led for summarily executing twelve Boer prisoners,&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1979, p. 538&lt;/ref&gt; and also for the murder of a German [[missionary]] believed to be a Boer sympathiser, all under unwritten orders approved by Kitchener. The celebrated horseman and bush poet [[Breaker Morant|Lt. Harry "Breaker" Morant]] and Lt. [[Peter Handcock]] were found guilty, sentenced to death, and shot by [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] at [[Polokwane|Pietersburg]] on 27 February 1902. Their death warrants were personally signed by Kitchener. He reprieved a third soldier, Lt. [[George Witton]], who served 28 months before being released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Barry |last=Bridges|title=Lord Kitchener and the Morant-Handcock Executions|work=Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, 73(1)|year= 1987 |pages= 24–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
[[File:Broome Park.jpg|thumb|[[Broome Park]], Kitchener's country house in Kent]]

[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Lord Kitchener was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], in 1902 and immediately began the task of reorganising the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]]. Kitchener's plan “The Reorganisation and Redistribution of the Army in India” recommended preparing the Indian Army for any potential war by reducing the size of fixed garrisons and reorganising it into two armies, to be commanded by the splendidly-named Generals [[Sir Bindon Blood|Blood]] and [[George Luck|Luck]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p108&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the [[Kitchener Reforms]] were supported by the [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon of Kedleston]], who had originally lobbied for Kitchener's appointment, the two men eventually came into conflict. Curzon wrote to Kitchener advising him that signing himself “Kitchener of Khartoum” took up too much time and space&amp;nbsp;– Kitchener commented on the pettiness of this (Curzon simply signed himself "Curzon" as an hereditary peer, although he later took to signing himself “Curzon of Kedleston”).&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p116&lt;/ref&gt; They also clashed over the question of military administration, as Kitchener objected to the system whereby transport and logistics were controlled by a "Military Member" of the Viceroy's Council. The Commander-in-Chief won the crucial support of the government in London, and the Viceroy chose to resign.&lt;ref name=heath194&gt;Heathcote 1999, p194&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The First World War 1914-1918- Personalities Q115124.jpg|thumbnail|left|A portrait of Field Marshal Lord Kitchener in full dress uniform taken shortly after being promoted to the rank]]
Later events proved Curzon was right in opposing Kitchener's attempts to concentrate all military decision-making power in his own office. Although the offices of Commander-in-Chief and Military Member were now held by a single individual, senior officers could approach only the Commander-in-Chief directly. In order to deal with the Military Member, a request had to be made through the Army Secretary, who reported to the Indian Government and had right of access to the Viceroy. There were even instances, when the two separate bureaucracies produced different answers to a problem, with the Commander-in-Chief disagreeing with himself as Military Member. This became known as "the canonisation of duality". Kitchener's successor, [[General (British Army)|General]] [[Sir Garrett O'Moore Creagh|Sir O’Moore Creagh]], was nicknamed "no More K", and concentrated on establishing good relations with the Viceroy, [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p148-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener presided over the [[Rawalpindi Parade 1905|Rawalpindi Parade]] in 1905 to honour the Prince and Princess of Wales's visit to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsdh.org/feltham/cathy_day/rawal2.htm|title=Rawalpindi Parade|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Kitchener founded the Indian Staff College at [[Quetta]] (now the Pakistani [[Command and Staff College]]), where his portrait still hangs.&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p114&lt;/ref&gt; His term of office as Commander-in-Chief, India, was extended by two years in 1907.&lt;ref name=heath194/&gt;

Kitchener was promoted to the highest Army rank, [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]], on 10 September 1909 and went on a tour of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=heath194/&gt; He aspired to be [[Viceroy of India]], but the [[Secretary of State for India]], [[John Morley]], was not keen and hoped to send him instead to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]] as Commander-in-Chief of British forces in the Mediterranean, even to the point of announcing the appointment in the newspapers. Kitchener pushed hard for the Viceroyalty, returning to London to lobby Cabinet ministers and the dying [[King Edward VII]], from whom, whilst collecting his field marshal's baton, Kitchener obtained permission to refuse the Malta job. However, Morley could not be moved. This was perhaps in part because Kitchener was thought to be a Tory (the Liberals were in office at the time); perhaps due to a Curzon-inspired whispering campaign; but most importantly because Morley, who was a [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstonian]] and thus suspicious of imperialism, felt it inappropriate, after the recent grant of limited self-government under the 1909 Indian Councils Act, for a serving soldier to be Viceroy (in the event, no serving soldier was appointed Viceroy until [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Lord Wavell]] in 1943, during the [[World War II|Second World War]]). The Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert Henry Asquith]], was sympathetic to Kitchener but was unwilling to overrule Morley, who threatened resignation, so Kitchener was finally turned down for the post of Viceroy of India in 1911.&lt;ref name=heath195&gt;Heathcote 1999, p195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Egypt ==
In June 1911 Kitchener then returned to Egypt as British Agent and Consul-General in Egypt during the formal reign of [[Abbas Hilmi II]] as [[Khedive]].&lt;ref name=heath195/&gt;

At the time of the [[Agadir Crisis]] (summer 1911), Kitchener told the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] that he expected the Germans to walk through the French “like partridges” and he informed [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] “that if they imagined that he was going to command the Army in France he would see them damned first”.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman 1962, p194&lt;/ref&gt;

He was created '''[[Earl Kitchener]]''', of Khartoum and of [[Barham, Kent|Broome in the County of Kent]], on 29 June 1914.&lt;ref name=heath195/&gt;

During this period he became a proponent of [[Scouting]] and coined the phrase "once a Scout, always a Scout."&lt;ref&gt;John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Raising the New Armies ====

[[File:Kitchener recruitment.jpg|thumb|left|Young men besieging the recruiting offices in Whitehall, London]]
At the outset of the [[World War I|First World War]], the Prime Minister, Asquith, quickly had Lord Kitchener appointed [[Secretary of State for War]]; Asquith had been filling the job himself as a stopgap following the resignation of [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|Colonel Seely]] over the [[Curragh Incident]] earlier in 1914. Kitchener was in Britain on his annual summer leave, between 23 June and 3 August 1914, and had boarded a cross-Channel steamer to commence his return trip to Cairo when he was recalled to London to meet with Asquith.&lt;ref&gt;Faught, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; War was declared at 11pm the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iwm.org.uk/sites/default/files/press-release/4_August_1914_Factsheet.pdf|title=Factsheet: 4 August 1914|publisher=Imperial War Museum|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against cabinet opinion, Kitchener correctly predicted a long war that would last at least three years, require huge new armies to defeat Germany, and cause huge casualties before the end would come. Kitchener stated that the conflict would plumb the depths of manpower "to the last million". A massive [[Recruitment to the British Army during World War I|recruitment campaign]] began, which soon featured a [[Lord Kitchener Wants You|distinctive poster of Kitchener]], taken from a magazine front cover. It may have encouraged large numbers of volunteers, and has proven to be one of the most enduring images of the war, having been copied and parodied many times since. Kitchener built up the "New Armies" as separate units because he distrusted the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorials]] from what he had seen with the French Army in 1870. This may have been a mistaken judgement, as the British reservists of 1914 tended to be much younger and fitter than their French equivalents a generation earlier.&lt;ref name="Terraine 1960, p39-40"&gt;Terraine 1960, p39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinet Secretary [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]] wrote of Kitchener:
{{quote|The great outstanding fact is that within eighteen months of the outbreak of the war, when he had found a people reliant on sea-power, and essentially non-military in their outlook, he had conceived and brought into being, completely equipped in every way, a national army capable of holding its own against the armies of the greatest military Power the world had ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;Hankey 1961, p508&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]] later wrote of Kitchener "he hated organisations; he smashed organisations ... he was a Master of Expedients".&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p38&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Deploying the BEF ====
At the War Council (5 August) Kitchener and Lt.-General [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] argued that the BEF should be deployed at [[Amiens]], where it could deliver a vigorous counterattack once the route of German advance was known. Kitchener argued that the deployment of the BEF in Belgium would result in having to retreat and abandon much of its supplies almost immediately, as the Belgian Army would be unable to hold its ground against the Germans; Kitchener was proved right, but given the belief in fortresses common at the time, it is not surprising that the War Council disagreed with him.&lt;ref&gt;Cassar 1985, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener, believing Britain should husband her resources for a long war, decided at Cabinet (6 August) that the initial BEF would consist of only 4 infantry divisions (and 1 cavalry), not the 5 or 6 promised.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp198&lt;/ref&gt; His decision to hold back two of the six divisions of the BEF, although based on exaggerated concerns about German invasion of Britain, arguably saved the BEF from disaster as [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]] (on the advice of [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] who was much influenced by the French), might have been tempted to advance further into the teeth of the advancing German forces, had his own force been stronger.&lt;ref name="Terraine 1960, p39-40"/&gt;

Kitchener's wish to concentrate further back at Amiens may also have been influenced by a largely accurate map of German dispositions which was published by [[Charles à Court Repington|Repington]] in ''The Times'' on the morning of 12 August.&lt;ref name="Terraine 1960, p39-40"/&gt; Kitchener had a three-hour meeting (12 August) with Sir John French, [[Archibald Murray|Murray]], [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] and the French liaison officer Victor Huguet, before being overruled by [[H.H. Asquith|the Prime Minister]], who eventually agreed that the BEF should assemble at Maubeuge.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp199&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir John French's orders from Kitchener were to cooperate with the French but not to take orders from them. Given that the tiny BEF (about 100,000 men, half of them serving regulars and half reservists) was Britain's only field army, Lord Kitchener also instructed French to avoid undue losses and exposure to “forward movements where large numbers of French troops are not engaged” until Kitchener himself had had a chance to discuss the matter with the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp199-201&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Meeting with Sir John French ====
The BEF Commander Sir John French, concerned at heavy British losses at the [[Battle of Le Cateau]], was considering withdrawing his forces from the Allied line. By 31 August Joffre, President [[Raymond Poincaré|Poincaré]] (relayed via Bertie, the British Ambassador) and Kitchener sent him messages urging him not to do so. Kitchener, authorised by a midnight meeting of whichever Cabinet Ministers could be found, left for France for a meeting with Sir John on 1 September.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p231&lt;/ref&gt;

They met, together with [[René Viviani|Viviani]] (French Prime Minister) and [[Alexandre Millerand|Millerand]] (now French War Minister). Huguet recorded that Kitchener was "calm, balanced, reflective" whilst Sir John was "sour, impetuous, with congested face, sullen and ill-tempered". On [[Francis Bertie, 1st Viscount Bertie of Thame|Bertie]]’s advice Kitchener dropped his intention of inspecting the BEF. French and Kitchener moved to a separate room, and no independent account of the meeting exists. After the meeting Kitchener telegraphed the Cabinet that the BEF would remain in the line, although taking care not to be outflanked, and told French to consider this "an instruction". French had a friendly exchange of letters with Joffre.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp231-6&lt;/ref&gt;

French had been particularly angry that Kitchener had arrived wearing his field marshal's uniform. This was how Kitchener normally dressed at the time (Hankey thought Kitchener's uniform tactless, but it had probably not occurred to him to change), but French felt that Kitchener was implying that he was his military superior and not simply a cabinet member. By the end of the year French thought that Kitchener had "gone mad" and his hostility had become common knowledge at [[General Headquarters British Army (1914-1918)|GHQ]] and [[Grand Quartier Général (1914–1919)|GQG]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp231, 234–6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1915 ===
[[File:Kitchener's Dream DSCF9948.JPG|thumb|''Kitchener's Dream'', German propaganda medal, 1915]]

====Strategy====
In January 1915, Field Marshal Sir John French, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force, with the concurrence of other senior commanders (e.g. General Sir Douglas Haig), wanted the New Armies incorporated into existing divisions as battalions rather than sent out as entire divisions. French felt (wrongly) that the war would be over by the summer before the New Army divisions were deployed, as Germany had recently redeployed some divisions to the east, and took the step of appealing to the Prime Minister, Asquith, over Kitchener's head, but Asquith refused to overrule Kitchener. This further damaged relations between French and Kitchener, who had travelled to France in September 1914 during the [[First Battle of the Marne]] to order French to resume his place in the Allied line.&lt;ref&gt;Groot 1988, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener warned French in January 1915 that the Western Front was a siege line that could not be breached, in the context of Cabinet discussions about amphibious landings on the Baltic or North Sea Coast, or against Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands 2006, p166&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to find a way to relieve pressure on the Western front, Lord Kitchener proposed an invasion of [[İskenderun|Alexandretta]] with [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC), [[New Army (British)|New Army]], and [[British Indian Army|Indian]] troops. Alexandretta was an area with a large Christian population and was the strategic centre of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s railway network&amp;nbsp;— its capture would have cut the empire in two.Yet he was instead eventually persuaded to support [[Winston Churchill]]'s disastrous [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in 1915–1916. (Churchill's responsibility for the failure of this campaign is debated; for more information see David Fromkin's ''A Peace to End All Peace.'') That failure, combined with the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]]&amp;nbsp;– amidst press publicity engineered by Sir John French&amp;nbsp;– dealt Kitchener's political reputation a heavy blow; Kitchener was popular with the public, so Asquith retained him in office in the new coalition government, but responsibility for munitions was moved to a new ministry headed by [[David Lloyd George]]. He was a sceptic about the tank, which is why it was [[Landships Committee|developed]] under the auspices of Churchill's Admiralty.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands 2006, p174&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Russians being pushed back from Poland, Kitchener thought the transfer of German troops west and a possible invasion of Britain increasingly likely, and told the War Council (14 May) that he was not willing to send the New Armies overseas. He wired French (16 May 1915) that he would send no more reinforcements to France until he was clear the German line could be broken, but sent two divisions at the end of May to please Joffre, not because he thought a breakthrough possible.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p293&lt;/ref&gt; He had wanted to conserve his New Armies to strike a knockout blow in 1916–17, but by the summer of 1915 realised that high casualties and a major commitment to France were inescapable. “Unfortunately we have to make war as we must, and not as we should like” as he told the Dardanelles Committee on 20 August 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p14, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

At an Anglo-French conference at Calais (6 July) Joffre and Kitchener, who was opposed to “too vigorous” offensives, reached a compromise on “local offensives on a vigorous scale”, and Kitchener agreed to deploy New Army divisions to France. An inter-Allied conference at Chantilly (7 July, including Russian, Belgian, Serb and Italian delegates) agreed on coordinated offensives.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp294-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kitchener now came to support the upcoming Loos offensive. He travelled to France for talks with Joffre and Millerand (16 August). The French leaders believed [[Great Retreat (Russian)|Russia might sue for peace]] (Warsaw had fallen on 4 August). Kitchener (19 August) ordered the [[Battle of Loos|Loos offensive]] to proceed, despite the attack being on ground not favoured by French or Haig (then commanding [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]]).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp299-300&lt;/ref&gt; The Official History later admitted that Kitchener hoped to be appointed Supreme Allied Commander. [[Basil Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart]] speculated that this was why he allowed himself to be persuaded by [[Joseph Joffre|Joffre]]. New Army divisions first saw action at Loos in September 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell Hart 1930, p.197&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reduction in powers====
Kitchener continued to lose favour with politicians and professional soldiers. He found it “repugnant and unnatural to have to discuss military secrets with a large number of gentlemen with whom he was but barely acquainted”. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] complained that he would either lapse into “obstinacy and silence” or else mull aloud over various difficulties. [[Alfred Milner|Milner]] told [[Howell Arthur Gwynne|Gwynne]] (18 August 1915) that he thought Kitchener a “slippery fish”.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p14&lt;/ref&gt; By autumn 1915, with Asquith's Coalition close to breaking up over conscription, he was blamed for his opposition to that measure (which would eventually be introduced for single men in [[Military Service Act 1916|January 1916]]) and for the excessive influence which civilians like Churchill and Haldane had come to exert over strategy, allowing ''ad hoc'' campaigns to develop in Sinai, Mesopotamia and [[Macedonian front|Salonika]]. Generals such as [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|Sir William Robertson]] were critical of Kitchener's failure to ask the General Staff (whose chief [[James Wolfe-Murray]] was intimidated by Kitchener) to study the feasibility of any of these campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p14, 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener advised the Dardanelles Committee (21 October) that Baghdad be seized for the sake of prestige then abandoned as logistically untenable. His advice was no longer accepted without question, but the British forces were eventually besieged and captured at [[Siege of Kut|Kut]].&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kitchener and Birdwood at Anzac 2.jpg|thumb|Kitchener with General [[William Birdwood|Birdwood]] at Anzac, November 1915]]
[[Archibald Murray]] (Chief of the Imperial General Staff) later recorded that Kitchener was “quite unfit for the position of secretary of state” and “impossible”, claiming that he never assembled the [[Army Council (1904)|Army Council]] as a body, but instead gave them orders separately, and was usually exhausted by Friday. Kitchener was also keen to break up Territorial units whenever possible whilst ensuring that “No “K” Division left the country incomplete”. Murray wrote that “He seldom told the absolute the truth and the whole truth” and claimed that it was not until he left on a tour of inspection of Gallipoli and the Near East that Murray was able to inform the Cabinet that volunteering had fallen far below the level needed to maintain a BEF of 70 divisions, requiring the introduction of conscription. The Cabinet insisted on proper General Staff papers being presented in Kitchener's absence.&lt;ref&gt;Bonham-Carter 1963, pp131-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Asquith, who told Robertson that Kitchener was “an impossible colleague” and “his veracity left much to be desired”, hoped that he could be persuaded to remain in the region as Commander-in-Chief and acted in charge of the War Office, but Kitchener took his seals of office with him so he could not be sacked in his absence. Douglas Haig&amp;nbsp;– at that time involved in intrigues to have Robertson appointed [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]]&amp;nbsp;– recommended that Kitchener be appointed Viceroy of India (“where trouble was brewing”) but not to the Middle East, where his strong personality would have led to that sideshow receiving too much attention and resources.&lt;ref&gt;Groot 1988, p.212&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener visited Rome and Athens, but [[Archibald Murray|Murray]] warned that he would likely demand the diversion of British troops to fight the Turks in the Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p20&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener and Asquith were agreed that Robertson should become CIGS, but Robertson refused to do this if Kitchener “continued to be his own CIGS”, although given Kitchener's great prestige he did not want him to resign; he wanted the Secretary of State to be sidelined to an advisory role like the Prussian War Minister. Asquith asked them to negotiate an agreement, which they did over the exchange of several draft documents at the [[Hotel de Crillon]] in Paris. Kitchener agreed that Robertson alone should present strategic advice to the Cabinet, with Kitchener responsible for recruiting and supplying the Army, although he refused to agree that military orders should go out over Robertson's signature alone – it was agreed that the Secretary of State should continue to sign orders jointly with the CIGS. The agreement was formalised in a Royal Order in Council in January 1916. Robertson was suspicious of efforts in the Balkans and Near East, and was instead committed to major British offensives against Germany on the Western Front&amp;nbsp;— the first of these was to be the Somme in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p24&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1916 ===
Early in 1916 Kitchener visited Douglas Haig, newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the BEF in France. Kitchener had been a key figure in the removal of Haig's predecessor Sir John French, with whom he had a poor relationship. Haig differed with Kitchener over the importance of Mediterranean efforts and wanted to see a strong General Staff in London, but nonetheless valued Kitchener as a military voice against the folly of civilians such as Churchill. However, he thought Kitchener "pinched, tired, and much aged", and thought it sad that his mind was “losing its comprehension” as the time for decisive victory on the Western Front (as Haig and Robertson saw it) approached.&lt;ref&gt;Groot 1988, p.228&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener was somewhat doubtful of Haig's plan to win decisive victory in 1916, and would have preferred smaller and purely attritional attacks, but sided with Robertson in telling the Cabinet that the planned Anglo-French offensive on the Somme should go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Groot 1988, p.238–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener was under pressure from French Prime Minister [[Aristide Briand]] (29 March 1916) for the British to attack on the Western Front to help relieve the pressure of the German attack at [[Verdun]]. The French refused to bring troops home from Salonika, which Kitchener thought a play for the increase of French power in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Groot 1988, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 1916, Lord Kitchener personally answered questions asked by politicians about his running of the war effort; at the start of hostilities Kitchener had ordered two million rifles from various US arms manufacturers. Only 480 of these rifles had arrived in the UK by 4 June 1916. The numbers of shells supplied were no less paltry. Kitchener explained the efforts he had made to secure alternative supplies. He received a resounding vote of thanks from the 200 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] who had arrived to question him, both for his candour and for his efforts to keep the troops armed; [[Ivor Treowen, 1st Baron Treowen|Sir Ivor Herbert]], who, a week before, had introduced the failed vote of censure in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] against Kitchener's running of the War Department, personally seconded the motion.&lt;ref&gt;Burg 2010, p120&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his military work, Lord Kitchener contributed to efforts on the home front. The knitted sock patterns of the day used a seam up the toe that could rub uncomfortably against the toes. Kitchener encouraged British and American women to knit for the war effort, and contributed a sock pattern featuring a new technique for a seamless join of the toe, still known as the [[Grafting (knitting)|Kitchener stitch]].&lt;ref&gt;Berry &amp; Leggitt 2004, p82&lt;/ref&gt;

====Russian mission====
In the midst of his other political and military concerns, Kitchener had devoted personal attention to the deteriorating situation on the Eastern Front. This included the provision of extensive stocks of war material for the Russian armies, which had been under increasing pressure since mid-1915.&lt;ref&gt;Faught, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1916 the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Reginald Mckenna]] suggested that Kitchener head a special and confidential mission to Russia to discuss munition shortages, military strategy and financial difficulties with the Imperial Russian Government and the ''[[Stavka]]'' (military high command), which was now under the personal command of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].

Lord Kitchener sailed from [[Scrabster]] to [[Scapa Flow]] on 5 June 1916 aboard [[HMS Oak (1912)|HMS ''Oak'']] before transferring to the [[armoured cruiser]] [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS ''Hampshire'']] for his diplomatic mission to Russia. Shortly before 19:30 hrs the same day, steaming towards the Russian port of [[Arkhangelsk]] during a [[Beaufort scale|Force 9]] [[gale]], ''Hampshire'' struck a mine laid by the newly launched German U-boat ''[[SM U-75|U-75]]'' (commanded by Curt Beitzen) and sank west of the [[Orkney Islands]]. Recent research has set the death toll of those aboard ''Hampshire'' at 737.&lt;ref name=irvine&gt;Irvine et al. ''passim'' (various pages)&lt;/ref&gt; Only twelve survived.&lt;ref name=irvine/&gt;&lt;ref name=faught/&gt; Amongst the dead were all ten members of his entourage. Kitchener was seen standing on the [[quarterdeck]] during the approximately twenty minutes that it took the ship to sink. His body was never recovered.&lt;ref name=faught&gt;Faught, p. 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heath197&gt;Heathcote 1999, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. P.

==== Conspiracy theories ====
Kitchener's great fame, the suddenness of his death, and its apparently convenient timing for a number of parties gave almost immediate rise to a number of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about his death. One in particular was posited by [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] (of [[Oscar Wilde]] fame), positing a connection between Kitchener's death, the recent naval [[Battle of Jutland]], [[Winston Churchill]], and a Jewish conspiracy. Churchill successfully sued Douglas in what proved to be the last successful case of [[criminal libel]] in British legal history, and the latter spent six months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZTR19231117.2.44&amp;l=mi&amp;e=-------10--1----2--|title=Who killed Kitchener?|year=1923|publisher=New Zealand Truth|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another claimed that the ''Hampshire'' did not strike a mine at all, but was sunk by explosives secreted in the vessel by [[Irish Republicans]].&lt;ref name=heath197/&gt;

In 1926, a hoaxer named Frank Power claimed in the [[Sunday Referee]] newspaper that Kitchener's body had been found by a Norwegian fisherman. Power brought a coffin back from Norway and prepared it for burial in St. Paul's. At this point, however, the authorities intervened and the coffin was opened in the presence of police and a distinguished pathologist. The box was found to contain only tar for weight. There was widespread public outrage at Power, but he was never prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmshampshire.co.uk/ |title=The sinking of HMS ''Hampshire''|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Erich Ludendorff]], [[Generalquartiermeister]] and joint head (with von Hindenburg) of Germany's war effort in the 1920s stated that Russian communists working against the Tsar had betrayed the plan to visit the Russians to the German command. His account was that Kitchener was "[killed] because of his ability" as it was feared he would help the tsarist Russian Army to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Time Magazine|title=Foreign News: Lord Kitchener|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,927693,00.html#ixzz19Ab0GTjX |accessdate=21 July 2013|date=25 May 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick Joubert Duquesne]], a [[Boer]] soldier and spy, claimed that he had assassinated Kitchener after an earlier attempt to kill him in Cape Town failed.&lt;ref name="chances"&gt;Burnham 1944, p293&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested and court-martialled in Cape Town and sent to the penal colony of Bermuda, but managed to escape to the U.S.&lt;ref name="ronnie"&gt;{{cite book| last = Ronnie | first = Art | year = 1995 | title= Counterfeit hero : Fritz Duquesne, adventurer and spy | publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Md. | isbn = 1-55750-733-3 | oclc = 605599179|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MI5]] confirmed that Duquesne was "a German intelligence officer&amp;nbsp;... involved in a series of acts of sabotage against British shipping in South American waters during the [First World] war";&lt;ref name="MI5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/personal-files-april-2014.htm |title=Records of the Security Service; 1915 – 1918; KV 2/1953 |date=April 2014 |publisher=The National Archives |location=London, UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414011959/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/personal-files-april-2014.htm |archive-date=14 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was wanted for: "murder on the high seas, the sinking and burning of British ships, the burning of military stores, warehouses, coaling stations, conspiracy, and the falsification of Admiralty documents."&lt;ref&gt;London Daily Mail, 27 May 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Duquesne's story was that he returned to Europe, posed as the Russian Duke Boris Zakrevsky in 1916, and joined Kitchener in Scotland.&lt;ref name="clementwood"&gt;Wood 1931, p1-429&lt;/ref&gt; While on board HMS ''Hampshire'' with Kitchener, Duquesne signalled a German submarine that then sank the cruiser, and was rescued by the submarine, later being awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for his efforts.&lt;ref name="clementwood"/&gt;  Duquesne was later apprehended and tried by the authorities in the U.S. for insurance fraud, but managed to escape again.&lt;ref name="nyt28may, 1919"&gt;{{cite journal| author =| date=28 May 1919| title='Paralytic' Flees from Prison Ward; Captain Fritz Duquesne, Who Feigned Helplessness, Escapes from Bellevue. | journal=[[New York Times]]| volume=| issue=| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F04E0DD173AE03ABC4051DFB3668382609EDE| issn=0362-4331|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Second World War, he ran a German spy ring in the United States until he was caught by the [[FBI]] in what became the biggest roundup of spies in U.S. history: the ''[[Duquesne Spy Ring]]''.&lt;ref name="fbi"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=200 |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/the-duquesne-spy-ring |title=The Duquesne spy ring |work=Famous cases |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |accessdate=21 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930091931/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/the-duquesne-spy-ring |archivedate=30 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally, Kitchener's brother was to die in office in Bermuda in 1912, and his nephew, Major H.H.

Kitchener is officially remembered in a chapel on the north-west corner of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London, near the main entrance, where a memorial service was held in his honour.&lt;ref name="StPauls"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stpauls.co.uk/Cathedral-History/Explore-the-Cathedral/The-Chapels |title=The Chapels |publisher=St Paul's Cathedral |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the city named New Berlin was officially renamed [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] on 1 September 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/news-story/6743079-june-28-1916-exactly-346-people-voted-for-berlin-to-be-renamed-kitchener/ |title=June 28, 1916: Exactly 346 people voted for Berlin to be renamed Kitchener |website=Therecord.com |date=27 June 2016 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1970, the opening of new records has led historians to rehabilitate Kitchener's reputation to some extent. [[Robin Neillands]], for instance, notes that Kitchener consistently rose in ability as he was promoted.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands 2006, p28&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians now praise his strategic vision in the First World War, especially his laying the groundwork for the expansion of munitions production and his central role in the raising of [[British Army during World War I|the British army in 1914 and 1915]], providing a force capable of meeting Britain's continental commitment.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

His commanding image, appearing on recruiting posters demanding "[[Lord Kitchener Wants You|Your country needs you!]]", remains recognised and parodied in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlingtimes.co.uk/memorable_images53.htm |title=Lord Kitchener "Your country needs you!"|publisher=Sterling Times|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debate on Kitchener's sexuality ==
Some biographers have concluded that Kitchener was a latent or active [[homosexuality|homosexual]]. Writers who make the case for his homosexuality include [[H. Montgomery Hyde|Montgomery Hyde]],&lt;ref name=hyde&gt;Hyde 1972, p161&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Hyam,&lt;ref name=hyam&gt;Hyam 1991, p38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Denis Judd&lt;ref&gt;Judd 2011, pp.172–176&lt;/ref&gt; and Frank Richardson.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1981, p123&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Magnus hints at homosexuality, though Lady Winifred Renshaw said that Magnus later repudiated this belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitchenerscholars.org/pages/khartoum.htm|title= Field Marshal 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|publisher=The Kitchener Scholars' Association |date= |accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents of the case point to Kitchener's friend Captain Oswald Fitzgerald, his "constant and inseparable companion", whom he appointed his aide-de-camp. They remained close until they met a common death on their voyage to Russia.&lt;ref name=hyde/&gt; From his time in Egypt in 1892, he gathered around him a cadre of eager young and unmarried officers nicknamed "Kitchener's band of boys". He also avoided interviews with women, took a great deal of interest in the [[Scout (Scouting)|Boy Scout]] movement, and decorated his rose garden with four pairs of sculptured bronze boys. According to Hyam, "there is no evidence that he ever loved a woman".&lt;ref name=hyam/&gt;

Patrick Barkham, a contemporary journalist, remarked that Kitchener "has the failing acquired by most of the Egyptian officers, a taste for [[buggery]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick |last=Barkham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/gayrights/story/0,,1418932,00.html|title= Navy's new message: your country needs you, especially if you are gay|publisher=The Guardian|date= 21 February 2005|accessdate=21 July 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Niall |last=Ferguson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4721758/A-walking-talking-ramrod.html|title= A walking, talking ramrod?|date= 19 February 2001|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 July 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[A. N. Wilson]] his interests were not exclusively homosexual. "When the great field marshal stayed in aristocratic houses, the well informed young would ask servants to sleep across their bedroom threshold to impede his entrance". His compulsive objective was sodomy, regardless of their gender.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2003, p598&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chottar.jpg|thumb|275px|The cracked dry ground of [[Chott El Hodna]].]]
The '''Hodna''' ({{lang-fr|Le Hodna}}) is a [[natural region]] of [[Algeria]] located between the [[Tell Atlas|Tell]] and [[Saharan Atlas]] ranges at the eastern end of the ''[[Hautes Plaines]]''. It is a vast depression lying in the northeastern section of [[M'Sila Province]] and the western end of [[Batna Province]].

==Geography==
The Hodna region has a length of about 120&amp;nbsp;km in an NW - SE direction and a width of about 80&amp;nbsp;km. It is characterized by the [[Chott El Hodna]], an [[endorheic]] [[salt lake]], in its centre with seasonal [[brackish]] and saline pools and marshes. A thin film of water collects during wet seasons on the level terrain of the large lake basin, which becomes a [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]] when it dries. The elevation of the lake's surface is slightly below 400 m, while the surrounding [[steppe]]-like plain, characterized by wadis and [[oasis|oases]], averages between 500 and 600 meters in elevation in the communes near the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chott el-Hodna (lake, Algeria)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/268629/Chott-el-Hodna|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hodna natural region gives its name to the [[Hodna Mountains]] located to the north. Its southern limit is marked by the [[Ouled Nail Range]]. There are no mountains in its western limit, where the plateau stretches further westwards. The northern part of the Hodna is composed of [[silt]] and the southern part is mainly sandy. The lowest area of the basin is covered by the ''[[Sabkha|sebkha]]'', the salt lake, with a surface of 76 000 ha of naked salty clay that is seldom covered with water and is completely devoid of vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-notes-annotated-ramsar-17047/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E17047_4000_0__ The Annotated Ramsar List: Algeria]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hodna is a steppe where the climate is harsh, with very dry summers, cold winters and very irregular precipitation. Formerly all the inhabitants of the Hodna were [[nomad]]s. The soil is poor and local agriculture is limited to the grazing of sheep and goats on grassy high plateau areas and to some cereal cultivation. There are uncultivated areas of ''djerr'', small hillocks, to the north and to the east. The mountains have good reserves of water and there are freshwater springs in the area, but historically they have not been properly exploited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/geo_0003-4010_1954_num_63_335_14314 J.

The '''Insular Plate''' was an ancient [[oceanic plate]] that began [[subduct]]ing under the west-coast of [[North America]] around the early [[Cretaceous]] time. The Insular Plate had a chain of active [[volcanic island]]s that were called the [[Insular Islands]]. These volcanic Islands however collided then fused onto the west-coast of North America when the Insular Plate jammed then shut down ending the subduction zone.

'''Land''', sometimes referred to as '''dry land''', is the solid surface of [[Earth]] that is not permanently covered by [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Allaby, Chris Park, ''A Dictionary of Environment and Conservation'' (2013), p. 239, {{ISBN|0199641668}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support [[agriculture]], [[habitat]], and various [[natural resource]]s. Some life forms (including [[terrestrial plant]]s and [[terrestrial animal]]s) have developed from predecessor species that lived in [[body of water|bodies of water]].

Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called [[coast|coastal zones]]. The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The demarcation between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors. A [[maritime boundary]] is one example of a political demarcation. A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land. Solid rock [[landform]]s are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun. Demarcation can further vary due to tides and weather.

== Etymology and terminology ==
{{original research section|date=March 2018}}
{{refimprovesect|date=March 2018}}

The word 'land' is derived from Middle English ''land'', ''lond'' and [[Old English]] ''land'', ''lond'' (“earth, land, soil, ground; defined piece of land, territory, realm, province, district; landed property; country (not town); ridge in a ploughed field”), from Proto-Germanic ''*landą'' (“land”), and from Proto-Indo-European ''*lendʰ-'' (“land, heath”). Cognate with Scots ''land'' (“land”), West Frisian ''lân'' (“land”), Dutch ''land'' (“land”), German ''Land'' (“land, country, state”), Swedish ''land'' (“land, country, shore, territory”), Icelandic ''land'' (“land”). Non-Germanic cognates include Old Irish ''lann'' (“heath”), Welsh ''llan'' (“enclosure”), Breton ''lann'' (“heath”), Old Church Slavonic ''lędо'' from Proto-Slavic ''*lenda'' (“heath, wasteland”) and Albanian ''lëndinë'' (“heath, grassland”) from ''lëndë'' (“matter, substance”).

A continuous area of land surrounded by ocean is called a "landmass". Although it may be most often written as one word to distinguish it from the usage "[[Land#Land mass|land mass]]"—the measure of land area—it is also used as two words. Landmasses include [[supercontinent]]s, [[continent]]s, and [[island]]s. There are four major continuous landmasses on [[Earth]]: [[Afro-Eurasia]], the [[Americas]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]. Land, capable of being [[plough]]ed and used to grow [[crop]]s, is called [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', {{nowrap|3rd ed.}} "arable, ''adj.'' and ''n.''" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A country or region may be referred to as the [[Homeland#Motherland|motherland]], [[fatherland]], or [[homeland]] of its people. Many countries and other places have names incorporating [[-land]] (e.g. [[New Zealand]]).

== Land mass ==
{{Redirect|Landmass|the ambient album by Steve Roach|Landmass (album)}}
"Land mass" refers to the total [[surface area|surface]] [[area]] of the land of a geographical [[region]] or [[country]] (which may include discontinuous pieces of land such as [[island]]s). It is written as two words to distinguish it from the usage "landmass", the contiguous area of land surrounded by [[ocean]]. [[Earth]]'s total land mass is approximately {{convert|148,939,063.133|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} which is about 29.2% of its total surface. Water covers approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface, mainly in the form of [[ocean]]s and ice formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oceanicinstitute.org/aboutoceans/aquafacts.html|title=Aqua Facts|publisher=Hawai'i Pacific University Oceanic Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural perspectives==
{{main article|Earth in culture}}
[[Creation myth]]s in many [[religion]]s recall a story involving the creation of the world by a supernatural [[deity]] or deities, including accounts wherein the land is separated from the oceans and the air. The Earth itself has often been personified as a [[deity]], in particular a [[goddess]]. In many cultures, the [[mother goddess]] is also portrayed as a [[Fertility god|fertility deity]]. To the [[Aztec]]s, Earth was called ''[[Tonantzin]]''—"our mother"; to the [[Incas]], Earth was called ''[[Pachamama]]''—"mother earth". The Chinese Earth goddess [[Hou Tu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=E.T.C. | last=Werner | year=1922 | title=Myths &amp; Legends of China | publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd. | location=New York | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15250 | accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Greek goddess personifying the Earth. [[Bhumi Devi|Bhuma Devi]] is the goddess of Earth in [[Hinduism]], influenced by [[Graha]]. In [[Norse mythology]], the Earth giantess [[Jörð]] was the mother of [[Thor]] and the daughter of [[Annar]]. [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egyptian mythology]] is different from that of other cultures because Earth ([[Geb]]) is male and sky ([[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]) is female.

In the past, there were varying levels of belief in a [[flat Earth]]. The Jewish conception of a flat earth is found in both biblical and post-biblical times.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The picture of the universe in Talmudic texts has the Earth in the center of creation with heaven as a hemisphere spread over it. Biblical writings, such as the Genesis creation story and the various Psalms that extol the firmament, the stars, the sun, and the earth, give similar explanations. The Hebrews saw the earth as an almost flat surface consisting of a solid and a liquid part and the sky as the realm of light in which heavenly bodies move. The earth rested on cornerstones and could not be moved except by Jehovah (as in an earthquake). According to the Hebrews, the sun and the moon were only a short distance from one another. "Cosmology." Encyclopedia Americana. Grolier Online, 2012. Author: Giorgio Abetti, Astrophysical Observatory of Arcetri-Firenze.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pov-inline|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Earth is usually described as a disk encircled by water. Cosmological and metaphysical speculations were not to be cultivated in public nor were they to be committed to writing. Rather, they were considered to be "secrets of the Torah not to be passed on to all and sundry" (Ketubot 112a). While study of God's creation was not prohibited, speculations about "what is above, what is beneath, what is before, and what is after" (Mishnah Hagigah: 2) were restricted to the intellectual elite. (Topic Overview: Judaism, Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, Ed. J. Wentzel Vrede van Huyssteen. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference, 2003. pp. 477–483. Hava Tirosh-Samuelson).&lt;/ref&gt;{{pov-inline|date=May 2017}}[[Image:Baylonianmaps.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Babylonian Map of the World|Imago Mundi]]'' Babylonian map, the oldest known world map, 6th century BC [[Babylonia]].]]

In early Egyptian&lt;ref&gt;H. and H.A. Frankfort, J.A. Wilson, and T. Jacobsen, Before Philosophy (Baltimore: Penguin, 1949) 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian thought]], the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean. The Egyptian universe was pictured as a rectangular box with a north-south orientation and with a slightly concave surface, with Egypt in the center. A similar model is found in the [[Homeric]] account of the 8th century BC in which "Okeanos, the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods."&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Pyramid Texts]] and [[Coffin Texts]] reveal that the ancient Egyptians believed [[Nu (mythology)|Nun]] (the ocean) was a circular body surrounding ''nbwt'' (a term meaning "dry lands" or "islands"), and therefore believed in a similar Ancient Near Eastern circular Earth cosmography surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;''Pyramid Texts'', Utterance 366, 629a–629c: "Behold, thou art great and round like the Great Round; Behold, thou are bent around, and art round like the Circle which encircles the nbwt; Behold, thou art round and great like the Great Circle which sets."''(Faulkner 1969, 120)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', Pritchard, 1969, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Coffin Texts'', Spell 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spherical form of the Earth was suggested by early [[Greek philosophers]], a belief espoused by [[Pythagoras]]. Contrary to popular belief, most people in the [[Middle Ages]] did not believe the Earth was flat: this misconception is often called the "[[Myth of the Flat Earth]]". As evidenced by thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], the European belief in a [[spherical Earth]] was widespread by this point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Russell | first = Jeffrey B. | url = http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html | title = The Myth of the Flat Earth | publisher = American Scientific Affiliation | accessdate = 2007-03-14 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/617EnVfVa?url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html | archivedate = 2011-08-22 | df =  }}; but see also [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to circumnavigation of the planet and the introduction of [[space flight]], belief in a spherical Earth was based on observations of the secondary effects of the Earth's shape and parallels drawn with the shape of other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Extraterrestrial land==
Most planets known to humans are either gaseous [[Jovian planets]] or solid [[terrestrial planets]]. Terrestrial planets include [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]. These inner planets have a rocky surface with metal interiors.&lt;ref&gt;NASA Solar System Exploration [https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=168 Terrestrial Planet Interiors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105322/https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/display.cfm?IM_ID=168 |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jovian planets consist of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. While these planets are larger, their only land surface is a small rocky core surrounded by a large, thick atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/print/lithos/jovianplanets.pdf The Jovian Planets] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YLhNKGil?url=http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/print/lithos/jovianplanets.pdf |date=2015-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gas giant]]s, Jupiter and Saturn, are thought to have surface layers composed of [[liquid hydrogen]] rather than solid land; however, their [[planetary geology]] is not well understood. The possibility of Uranus and Neptune (the [[ice giant]]s) possessing hot, highly compressed, supercritical water&lt;!-- {{efn|name=pressures}} --&gt; under their thick atmospheres has been hypothesised.  While their composition is still not fully understood, a 2006 study by Wiktorowicz et al. ruled out the possibility of such a water "ocean" existing on Neptune,&lt;ref name="WiktorowiczIngersoll2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiktorowicz|first1=Sloane J.|last2=Ingersoll|first2=Andrew P.|title=Liquid water oceans in ice giants|journal=Icarus|volume=186|issue=2|year=2007|pages=436–447|issn=0019-1035|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.09.003|arxiv = astro-ph/0609723 |bibcode = 2007Icar..186..436W }}&lt;/ref&gt; though some studies have suggested that exotic oceans of liquid diamond are possible.&lt;ref name="Silvera2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silvera|first1=Isaac|title=Diamond: Molten under pressure|journal=Nature Physics|volume=6|issue=1|year=2010|pages=9–10|issn=1745-2473|doi=10.1038/nphys1491|bibcode = 2010NatPh...6....9S |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:9121282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire surface of a rocky planet or moon is considered land, even with a lack of seas or oceans for contrast.

==Land and climate==
The land of the Earth interacts with and influences [[climate]] heavily since the surface of the land heats up and cools down faster than air or water.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media"&gt;PBS Learning Media [http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ttv10.sci.ess.land/the-effect-of-land-masses-on-climate/ The Effect of Land Masses on Climate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092309/http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/ttv10.sci.ess.land/the-effect-of-land-masses-on-climate/ |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latitude]], [[elevation]], [[topography]], [[reflectivity]], and [[land use]] all have varying effects. The latitude of the land will influence how much [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface. High latitudes receive less solar radiation than low latitudes.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt; The height of the land is important in creating and transforming airflow and [[precipitation]] on Earth. Large landforms, such as mountain ranges, divert wind energy and make the air parcel less dense and able to hold less heat.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt; As air rises, this cooling effect causes [[condensation]] and [[precipitation]]. Reflectivity of the earth is called planetary [[albedo]] and the type of land cover that receives energy from the sun affects the amount of energy that is reflected or transferred to Earth.&lt;ref name="Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research"&gt;Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research [http://alanbetts.com/understanding-climate-change/question/the-climate-energy-balance-of-the-earth/ The Climate Energy Balance of the Earth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150305041546/http://alanbetts.com/understanding-climate-change/question/the-climate-energy-balance-of-the-earth |date=2015-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vegetation]] has a relatively low albedo meaning that vegetated surfaces are good absorbers of the sun’s energy. [[Forests]] have an albedo of 10–15% while [[grasslands]] have an albedo of 15–20%. In comparison, sandy [[deserts]] have an albedo of 25–40%.&lt;ref name="Alan Betts: Atmospheric Research"/&gt; Land use by humans also plays a role in the regional and global climate. Densely populated cities are warmer and create [[urban heat islands]] that have effects on the precipitation, cloud cover, and temperature of the region.&lt;ref name="PBS Learning Media" /&gt;

[[File:Anonymous The Noord-Nieuwland in Table Bay, 1762.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An 18th-century painting of a [[Dutch East Indies Company|VOC]] ship with [[Table Mountain]] in the background, used by navigators as the landmark to sail around [[Cape of Good Hope|southern tip of Africa]].]]

A '''landmark''' is a recognizable natural or artificial feature used for [[navigation]], a feature that stands out from its near environment and is often visible from long distances.

In modern use, the term can also be applied to smaller structures or features, that have become local or [[national symbol]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:Welcome to the land of freedom.png|thumb|right|The [[Statue of Liberty]], a famous landmark of [[New York City]] and [[United States]], greets the newly arrived immigrants, located near [[Ellis Island]] where millions of immigrants first touched U.S. soil.]]
In old English the word ''landmearc'' (from ''land'' + ''mearc'' (mark)) was used to describe an "object set up to mark the boundaries of a kingdom, estate, etc.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=landmark |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |website=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from approx. 1560, this understanding of landmark was replaced by a more general one. A landmark became a "conspicuous object in a landscape".
A ''landmark'' literally meant a [[geographic feature]] used by [[exploration|explorers]] and others to find their way back or through an area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} For example, the [[Table Mountain]] near [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] is used as the landmark to help sailors to navigate around southern tip of [[Africa]] during the [[Age of Exploration]]. Artificial structures are also sometimes built to assist sailors in naval navigation. The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] and [[Colossus of Rhodes]] are ancient structures built to lead ships to the port.

In modern usage, a landmark includes anything that is easily recognizable, such as a [[monument]], [[building]], or other [[structure]]. In [[American English]] it is the main term used to designate places that might be of interest to [[tourist]]s due to notable physical features or historical significance. Landmarks in the [[British English]] sense are often used for casual [[navigation]], such as giving directions. This is done in American English as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In [[urban studies]] as well as in [[geography]], a landmark is furthermore defined as an external point of reference that helps orienting in a familiar or unfamiliar environment.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Kevin. "The image of the city". [[MIT Press]], 1960, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Landmarks are often used in verbal route instructions and as such an object of study by [[linguist]]s as well as in other fields of study.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Types==

Landmarks are usually classified as either natural landmarks or man-made landmarks, both are originally used to support navigation on finding directions. A variant is a ''[[seamark]]'' or ''[[daymark]]'', a structure usually built intentionally to aid sailors navigating featureless coasts.

===Natural===
Natural landmarks can be characteristic features, such as [[mountain]]s or [[plateau]]s. Examples of natural landmarks are Table Mountain in South Africa, [[Mount Ararat]] in Turkey, [[Uluru]] in Australia, [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan and [[Grand Canyon]] in the United States. Trees might also serve as local landmarks, such as jubilee oaks or [[conifer]]s. Some landmark trees may be nicknamed, examples being ''Queen's Oak'', ''Hanging Oak'' or ''Centennial Tree''.

===Human made===
In modern sense, landmarks are usually referred to as [[monument]]s or prominent distinctive buildings, used as the symbol of a certain area, city, or [[National symbol|nation]], such as the [[Statue of Unity]] in [[Narmada District | Narmada]] ,[[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington (D.C.)]], [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York City]], [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]] , [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]], [[Big Ben]] in [[London]], [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bratislava Castle]] in [[Bratislava]], [[Space Needle]] in [[Seattle]],   [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] or the [[Sydney Opera House]] both in [[Sydney]], [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Berlin]], the [[CN Tower]] In [[Toronto]], or [[Palace of Culture and Science]] in [[Warsaw]]. [[Church (building)|Church]] [[spire]]s and [[mosque]]'s [[minaret]]s are often very tall and visible from many miles around, thus often serve as built landmarks. Also [[town hall]] towers and [[Belfry (architecture)|belfries]] often have a landmark character.

This is a summary of notable '''incidents that have taken place at [[Walt Disney World]]''' in Florida. Several people have died or been injured while riding attractions at Walt Disney World theme parks. Since 2001, Disney has been required to report incidents to state authorities. For example, from the first quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006, Disney reported four deaths and nineteen injuries at its Florida parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060712/BUSINESS/607120351/1003 |title=Report on 2005–2006 incidents |publisher=Floridatoday.com |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220062706/http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060712%2FBUSINESS%2F607120351%2F1003 |archivedate=February 20, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''incident'' refers to major injury, injuries, deaths, and significant crimes. While these incidents are required to be reported to regulatory authorities for investigation, attraction-related incidents usually fall into one of these following categories:
* Negligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance.
* Caused by negligence on the part of the guest. This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to break park rules.
* The result of a guest's known, or unknown, health issues.
* [[Act of God]] or a generic accident (e.g. slipping and falling) that is not a direct result of an action on anyone's part.

According to a 1985 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article, nearly 100 lawsuits are filed against Disney each year for various incidents.&lt;ref name="Time1985"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962597,00.html |title=No Mickey Mousing Around |work=Time magazine |date=March 11, 1985 |accessdate=December 18, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120173014/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C962597%2C00.html |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida theme parks are required to notify the state of any ride-related injuries or illnesses that require a hospital stay of at least 24 hours.&lt;ref name="june2018report"/&gt;

===Other incidents involving guests===
* On December 25, 2015, a fight broke out at Bongo's Cuban Cafe between a 70-year-old male guest and the restaurant staff. The guest claimed that he was tired of waiting for his food. He argued with the restaurant's general manager and threw a punch but missed. Another employee jumped in to try to stop the confrontation. The guest was escorted out of the restaurant after he grabbed a worker's bicep, which left a mark. At some point during the fight, a series of loud sounds were mistaken as gunfire, causing patrons to panic and rush to the exits. This false information was also spread throughout social media, resulting in other guests in Disney Springs to panic as well. Police found no evidence of shots being fired. The man was arrested shortly thereafter in front of a Starbucks with no weapons in his possession, and was charged with battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Deputies: 70-year-old man's scuffle about food led to chaotic scene at Disney Springs |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-disney-springs-false-shooting-chaos-20151226-story.html |website=OrlandoSentinel.com |accessdate=December 27, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227022046/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-disney-springs-false-shooting-chaos-20151226-story.html |archivedate=December 27, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 14, 1986, the bodies of a 33-year-old man and a woman were discovered floating in a retention pond after they drove their car down an embankment and into the water during a heavy rainstorm several days earlier. Authorities speculate that the two attempted to escape from the vehicle through the driver's side window as it sank into the six-feet deep water. The vehicle's lights and windshield wipers were found in the "on" position, leading authorities to believe that the driver lost visibility during a rainstorm, jumped a curb and slid down an embankment into the pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamburg |first1=Jay |title=Tourists Miss Epcot Bridge, Die In Pond |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1986-01-15/news/0190180015_1_walt-disney-epcot-pond |website=OrlandoSentinel.com |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=September 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002132157/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1986-01-15/news/0190180015_1_walt-disney-epcot-pond |archivedate=October 2, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He fired four blasts at the guards and took two of them hostage in a restroom near the [[Imagination! (Epcot pavilion)|Journey Into Imagination pavilion]]. As Orange County sheriff's deputies surrounded the area, the man released his hostages and emerged from the restroom with the shotgun held to his chest. After exchanging words with deputies, he put the gun to his head and fired. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. Investigators attributed his actions to a recent breakup with his long-time girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painful Split Preceded Epcot Death |first=Jim |last=Leusner |newspaper=OrlandoSentinel |date=September 14, 1992 |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-09-14/news/9209140122_1_ferris-shotgun-solomons |accessdate=October 27, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908044056/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-09-14/news/9209140122_1_ferris-shotgun-solomons |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2012, a 41-year-old doctor from Naples, [[Italy]], was arrested after allegedly kicking his 3-year-old son in the face. According to arrest reports, several witnesses saw him kick his son while he sat in his stroller during an argument with his wife and children. An Epcot employee then "went up to the child and saw that his face was bloody and the child was crying hysterically". The father refused to let his son be taken to a hospital because he did not think the boy's injuries required further attention. Detectives noted that the boy's left eye was swollen and bruised with a cut below it. The doctor was eventually freed on a $2,000 bond after being arrested and charged with child abuse. Once back to Italy, he gave the media his own version of the story. He said that the incident occurred on June 30, 2012. He kicked his 9-year-old son after the boy overturned the stroller in which his little brother was seated. The toddler fell on his face and was therefore bleeding. One of the tourists, seeing the little child bleeding, called the police. The whole family was taken to a room and kept there for four hours; a young Italian woman on the premises, working for Disney, served as an emergency interpreter for the two parents; the man was then arrested and left in a police car for six hours before ending up jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/mondo/articoli/1052006/disney-world-litaliano-arrestato-si-difende-ho-dato-solo-un-calcio-nel-sedere-a-mio-figlio.shtml |title=Disney World, l'italiano arrestato si difende: "Ho dato solo un calcio nel sedere a mio figlio" - Mondo |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927201850/http://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it/mondo/articoli/1052006/disney-world-litaliano-arrestato-si-difende-ho-dato-solo-un-calcio-nel-sedere-a-mio-figlio.shtml |archivedate=September 27, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The man, who was intoxicated at the time of the incident, assaulted a female employee with a PVC pipe, and punched two male employees in the head. One male cast member received a large gash to his head and the other suffered minor injuries. The female was struck with the pipe on her left cheek and neck and was left with swelling behind her ears. The men were treated at nearby Celebration Hospital, while the female employee was treated on the scene. The man had entered the backstage office area in the Innoventions East attraction and tried to commandeer a cargo work cart when the confrontation began. Security officers arrived and tried to subdue him. He continued to shout incoherent statements and then fled the officers. They were able to eventually force him to the ground. When police arrived, the man was bleeding from his knees, wrists and hands. He later paid his bond at Orange County Jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2013/10/drunk_florida_man_attacks_thre.php |title=Drunk Florida Man Attacks Three Disney World Cast Members |publisher=Miami New Times |accessdate=October 14, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014210227/http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2013/10/drunk_florida_man_attacks_thre.php |archivedate=October 14, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 1, 2017, [[Giles Barnes]], [[Alex Morgan]], Courtney Toia, and [[Donny Toia|Donald Toia]] were all ejected from the park after Morgan and her group were partying inside a pub in the UK pavilion. An altercation ensued, and the OCSO reported that Barnes cut in front of another guest, resulting in a verbal argument between them.

* In March 2010, a 4-year-old boy from [[San Diego, California]], suffered severe burns to his face and neck after being scalded by a tray of hot nacho cheese. The accident occurred when the boy sat down to dinner in an unstable chair and grabbed a food tray to prevent himself falling, resulting in the cheese falling off of the food tray and into his lap.

A Disney representative commented on the incident: "It's unfortunate when any child is injured. We just received notice of the lawsuit and are currently reviewing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://consumerist.com/2011/02/family-sues-disney-says-too-hot-nacho-cheese-burned-son.html |title=Family Sues Disney, Says Too-Hot Nacho Cheese Burned Son |publisher=The Consumerist |date=February 17, 2010 |accessdate=February 17, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220055022/http://consumerist.com/2011/02/family-sues-disney-says-too-hot-nacho-cheese-burned-son.html |archivedate=February 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family settled out of court in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://orlando.legalexaminer.com/uncategorized/miscellaneous/family-of-boy-injured-at-disneys-magic-kingdom-accepts-settlement/ |website=The Legal Examiner|title=Family of Boy Injured at Disney’s Magic Kingdom Accepts Settlement |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34393">'''List of national border changes since World War I''' refers to changes in [[border]]s between [[nations]] during or since 1914. For information on border changes from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to 1914, see [[List of national border changes from 1815 to 1914]]. This is a list of significant boundary changes with countries. This refers to where there have been changes in borders only, not necessarily including changes in ownership of a territory. For instance many European colonies in Africa became independent without any adjustment to their borders, although some did have many changes. Also mentioned are some de facto changes, not recognized by the international community, such as [[Crimea]], [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]], and [[South Ossetia]].

=== United States ===
The Native American hereditary leaders during this time are not included. Those that are listed as former monarchs of what is now the continental United States were heads of European [[Seat (legal entity)|seated]] monarchies (or [[List of Emperors of Mexico|Mexican monarchs]], such as [[Agustín de Iturbide|Agustín I of Mexico]] and [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]) and themselves never set foot on American soil. Others were indigenous monarchs, such as [[Malietoa Tanumafili I]], [[Tu'i Manu'a Elisala|Tuʻi Manuʻa Elisala]] and [[Liliuokalani of Hawaii]]; The last monarch of each state and territory may not be the last colonial ruler (i.e. [[Louis XV of France]] is the last French monarch of [[Louisiana]], but [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], prior to becoming Emperor, was the last ruler of [[Louisiana]]). Also their end of reign may not be how the US acquired these states. One state can have more than one last monarch, since each state may have been the product of many different [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|acquisitions by the United States]]. Different claims of a foreign country are taken into account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">[[File:UK shipping forecast zones.png|thumb|The Malin shipping forecast zone approximates the Malin Sea]] 
The '''Malin Sea''' is a [[marginal sea]] of the [[North-East Atlantic]] over the '''Malin Shelf''', the [[continental shelf]] north of [[Ireland]] and southwest of [[Scotland]]. It is connected to the [[Irish Sea]] by the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]], and overlaps the [[Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland]]. Of the UK [[Shipping Forecast]] areas, the Malin Sea covers most of Malin, and by some definitions extends into Rockall.&lt;ref&gt;OSPAR  2000, fig. 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The area is within the [[exclusive economic zone]]s of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

==Extent==
Different authorities give different limits for the Malin Sea. The 2002 draft of the [[International Hydrographic Organization]]'s ''Limits of Seas'' publication lists "Malin Sea" as a synonym of [[Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/mtg_docs/com_wg/S-23WG/S-23WG_Misc/Draft_2002/S-23_Draft_2002_NORTH_ATLANTIC.doc|title=North Atlantic Ocean and its sub-divisions|year=2002|work=S-23 Limits of Seas; Draft of 4th edition|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|pages=7, fn|accessdate=30 May 2014}}; cited in Dormels 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Hardisty defines it separately from the [[Minches]] and [[Sea of the Hebrides]], which are parts of the Inner Seas; Dormels interprets Hardisty's definition as corresponding to roughly the southern half of the Inner Seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hardisty|first=Jack|title=The British Seas: An Introduction to the Oceanography and Resources of the North-west European Continental Shelf|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415035866}} cited in Dormels 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Banner defines it as "from the Irish Coast to lat. 56°20′N and from the Continental Shelf break to [[Kintyre]], comprising an area of more than 14,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;."&lt;ref name="Banner1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banner|first=Frederick Thomas|title=The North-West European shelf seas: the sea bed and the sea in motion|year=1980|publisher=Elsevier Scientific|isbn=9780444417343|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper et al. define the Malin Sea's southern limit as from [[Inishowen]] to [[Rathlin Island]].&lt;ref name="Cooper2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=J.A.G |author2=J.T Kelley |author3=D.F Belknap |author4=R Quinn |author5=J McKenna|year=2002|title=Inner shelf seismic stratigraphy off the north coast of Northern Ireland: new data on the depth of the Holocene lowstand|journal=Marine Geology|volume=186|issue=3–4|pages=369–387|issn=0025-3227|doi=10.1016/S0025-3227(02)00311-0|url=http://www.science.ulster.ac.uk/cma/slan/cooperetal2002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scottish Government]]'s Marine Atlas divides its coastal waters into habitats, one being "Minches and Malin Sea", defined as "north from the [[Mull of Kintyre]] to [[Cape Wrath]] incorporating the sea area between the Scottish mainland and the Western Isles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/03/16182005/19|title=Scotland's Marine Atlas: Information for The National Marine Plan|date=March 2011|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics}}

A '''merger''', '''consolidation''' or '''amalgamation''', in a political or administrative sense, is the combination of two or more political or administrative entities, such as [[municipality|municipalities]] (in other words [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, etc.), [[county|counties]], [[district]]s, etc., into a single entity. This term is used when the process occurs within a sovereign entity.

Unbalanced growth or outward expansion of one neighbor may necessitate an administrative decision to merge (see [[urban sprawl]]). In some cases, common perception of continuity may be a factor in prompting such a process (see [[conurbation]]).  Some cities (see [[#Notable municipal mergers|below]]) that have gone through amalgamation or a similar process had several administrative sub-divisions or jurisdictions, each with a separate [[Mayor|person in charge]].

[[Annexation]] is similar to amalgamation, but differs in being applied mainly to two cases:
#The units joined are sovereign entities before the process, as opposed to being units of a single political entity.
#A city's boundaries are expanded by adding territories not already incorporated as cities or villages.

==Notable municipal mergers==
The act of merging two or more [[Municipality|municipalities]] into a single new municipality may be done for a variety of reasons, including urban growth, reducing the cost of local government and improving the efficiency of municipal service delivery.

===Belgium===
In 1977, the 2,359 [[municipalities of Belgium]] were merged to 596 new municipalities.

===Brazil===
In 1975, the [[Guanabara (state)|state of Guanabara]] and the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil were merged. The former consisted of only the territorial limits of the city of Rio de Janeiro, formerly the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] as Brazilian capital until 1960, when it was moved to newly built [[Brasília]]. When merged, Guanabara became the [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|municipality of Rio de Janeiro]] within the new state. In geographical terms, it would seem the state of Rio would have incorporated Guanabara; but, as the administrative and financial resources of the former capital were significant and even larger than the rest of the state, the change was more correctly referred to as a merger (''fusão'').

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the 1990s saw the forced amalgamation of several municipal entities in the provinces of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] into larger new municipalities. The process created what was labeled a ''megacity'' by the media, although none of the created municipalities fit in the definition of a megacity in the international sense and some of them have fewer than a million inhabitants.

;Ontario
{{See also|Amalgamation of Toronto}}
The provincial government of [[Mike Harris]] undertook an extensive program of municipal mergers between 1996 and 2002. The province had 815 municipalities in 1996; by 2002, this had been reduced to just 447.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/currentrestructure.aspx Municipal restructuring since 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105084333/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/currentrestructure.aspx |date=2012-11-05 }}. Archives of Ontario. Retrieved January 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[list of municipalities in Ontario]] is updated regularly.
* [[Toronto]] – In 1967, the towns of [[Leaside]], [[Mimico]], [[New Toronto]] and [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]] and the villages of [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], [[Long Branch, Toronto|Long Branch]] and [[Swansea, Toronto|Swansea]] amalgamated into the city and boroughs comprising [[Metropolitan Toronto]]. In 1998, the former boroughs within Metropolitan Toronto were merged into a new [[Toronto|City of Toronto]].
* [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] – In 1973, the provincial government created the new City of Cambridge by amalgamating the City of Galt, the towns of [[Preston, Ontario|Preston]] and [[Hespeler, Ontario|Hespeler]], and the hamlet of Blair.
* [[Thunder Bay]] – On January 1, 1970, the twin cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], and [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]], merged into one city.

* [[Greater Sudbury]] – resulted from the merger of the former [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] in 2001; the regional municipality itself was created by a series of municipal amalgamations in 1973.
* [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] – In 2001, the former City of [[Stoney Creek, Ontario|Stoney Creek]] and the former towns of [[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]], [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]], [[Flamborough, Ontario|Flamborough]] and [[Glanbrook, Ontario|Glanbrook]] merged to create the new City of Hamilton.
* [[Temiskaming Shores]] – In 2004, the towns of New Liskeard and Haileybury, along with the township of Dymond, merged to create the new town of Temiskaming Shores.

;Quebec
{{See also|Reorganization of Montreal|Municipal reorganization in Quebec}}
* [[Gatineau]] – five municipalities in southwestern Quebec (Gatineau, [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], [[Aylmer, Quebec|Aylmer]], [[Buckingham, Quebec|Buckingham]] and [[Masson-Angers, Quebec|Masson-Angers]]) were merged into a new city of Gatineau in 2002.
* [[Longueuil]]
* [[Montreal]] – In the [[Reorganization of Montreal|Montreal Merger]] on January 1, 2002, the [[Parti Québécois]] provincial government merged all municipalities on the [[Island of Montreal]] into a new City of Montreal. On January 1, 2006, a partial demerger occurred.
* [[Quebec City]]
* [[Rouyn-Noranda]]
* [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]] – The cities of [[Chicoutimi]], [[Jonquière]], [[La Baie, Quebec|La Baie]] and [[Laterrière, Quebec|Laterrière]], along with the municipalities of Lac-Kénogami and Shipshaw and part of the township of Tremblay, were amalgamated into the City of Saguenay in 2002.
* [[Sherbrooke]]

;Manitoba
* [[Winnipeg]]: in 1971, the municipalities of [[Transcona, Winnipeg|Transcona]], [[St. Boniface, Manitoba|St. Boniface]], [[St. Vital, Winnipeg|St. Vital]], [[West Kildonan]], [[East Kildonan, Winnipeg|East Kildonan]], [[Tuxedo, Winnipeg|Tuxedo]], [[Old Kildonan]], [[North Kildonan]], [[Fort Garry, Winnipeg|Fort Garry]], [[Charleswood, Winnipeg|Charleswood]], and [[St. James, Manitoba|St. James]] were amalgamated via the [[City of Winnipeg Act]]. The word ''unicity'' is used more commonly than megacity to describe that particular amalgamation.

===Denmark===
In 1970, mergers brought the number of [[municipalities of Denmark]] from 1,098 to 277. In 2007, the (by then) 270 municipalities were consolidated into 98 municipalities, most of them results of mergers.

===Finland===
An ongoing series of mergers has reduced the number of [[municipalities of Finland]] from 432 in 2006 to 311 in 2017.

===Germany===
Several [[states of Germany|states]] of [[West Germany]] carried out municipal merger programmes in the 1960s and 1970s. In [[Baden-Württemberg]], the number of municipalities dropped from 3,379 to 1,110 between 1968 and 1975; in [[Bavaria]], from roughly 7,000 to roughly 2,000 between 1972 and 1978; in [[Hesse]], from 2,642 to 421 between 1972 and 1977; in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], from 2,365 to 396 between 1967 and 1975; and in [[Saarland]], from 345 to 50 in 1974. In the Bavarian town of [[Ermershausen]], citizens occupied the town hall to resist the merger with [[Maroldsweisach]] – unsuccessfully, although Ermershausen was reconstituted as an independent municipality in 1994 – and [[Horgau]], also in Bavaria, successfully appealed its merger with [[Zusmarshausen]] to the Constitutional Court of Bavaria (''Bayerischer Verfassungsgerichtshof''). Mergers have also taken place in the former [[East Germany]] after 1990, for example in [[Brandenburg]] in 2003.

===Greece===
The [[Kallikratis Plan]] replaced the 1033 [[municipalities and communities of Greece]] with 325 new municipalities in 2011.

===Hungary===
[[Budapest]], the capital and largest city in Hungary, was formed from the merger of the cities of Buda and Pest across the river Danube in 1873.

===Israel===
In 2003 the cities of [[Baqa al-Gharbiyye]] and [[Jatt, Israel|Jatt]] joined to form the city of [[Baqa-Jatt]], but the merger was dissolved in 2010.

===Japan===
{{main|Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan}}

===Malaysia===
On 21 April 2018, The Negeri Sembilan state government declared about merger of [[Seremban Municipal Council]] (MPS) and [[Nilai Municipal Council]] (MPN) to become Seremban City Council (MBS). Thus making [[Seremban]] elevated to city status in Jan 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesundaily.my/node/534043&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In November 2010, the Seven Councils of Auckland City: Auckland City Council, Manukau City Council, Waitakere City Council, North Shore City Council, Papakura District Council, Rodney District Council and most of Franklin District Council has seen amalgamated to form Auckland City Council.

===Portugal===
[[Portugal]] was one of the first countries in the world to make an enlarged modern administrative reform, particularly during the 19th century. In early 19th century, the country was divided into more than 800 municipalities. In 1832, during [[Portuguese Civil War]], a law from [[Mouzinho da Silveira]], minister from the liberal [[government-in-exile]] (which then ruled only in the [[Azores]]) simplified the public administration, and reduced the number of municipalities to 796. In 1836, after the liberal victory, Passos Manuel, minister from the government of the [[Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira|Marquess of Sá da Bandeira]] made a profound administrative reform which reduced significantly the number of municipalities, fixing it to 351. Passos Manuel reform followed a trend very decentralist, creating an elected municipal administration. In 1855, another series of mergers reduced the number of municipalities to 254. In the rest of the 19th century, some series of mergers occurred (particularly during the 1890s), meanwhile other municipalities were restored. Thereafter, the changes to the municipal map focused mainly on the restoration and creation of new municipalities, particularly in the 20th century. Nowadays, there are 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities in Portugal]]. The last alteration to the municipal map, occurred in 1998, with the creation of the municipalities of [[Odivelas Municipality|Odivelas]] (in [[Lisbon district]]), [[Trofa Municipality|Trofa]] (in [[Porto district]]) and [[Vizela Municipality|Vizela]] (in [[Braga district]]).

In 2013, more than 1,000 [[parish]]es/[[freguesia]]s were merged.

===Sweden===
Many rural [[municipalities of Sweden]] were merged in 1952; the number of them decreasing from 2,281 to 816. Another series of mergers, this time also including cities and market towns, reduced the total number of municipalities from roughly 1,000 in the early 1960s to 278 in 1974. As of 2013, Sweden has 290 municipalities.

===United States===
In United States politics, such a merged entity may be called a [[consolidated city–county]].
* [[City of Greater New York]] – The amalgamation of the 5 boroughs ([[Manhattan]], [[The Bronx]], [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[Queens, New York|Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]) of New York.
* [[Unigov]] – The local government amalgamation of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].
* In [[New Jersey]], [[Borough of Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton Borough]] and [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]] became one municipality ([[Princeton, New Jersey]]), in January 2013, after voters passed a referendum in early November 2011, supported by residents of both municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Mancuso/The Times |url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2011/11/princeton_voters_approve_conso.html |title=Princeton voters approve consolidation of borough, township into one municipality |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale''' was an airfield of the [[United States Navy]] just outside [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]. In 1942, the [[U.S. Navy]] selected Merle Fogg Airport in Fort Lauderdale to expand into a [[naval air station]] for both pilot and enlisted aircrew training (i.e., gunners, radiomen) in [[Grumman TBF Avenger]] torpedo bombers flown by carrier-based [[US Navy]] flight crews and by land-based [[US Marine Corps]] flight crews ashore.&lt;ref name="NASFtLaudhist"&gt;[http://www.bobjenny-artist.com/nas/history.htm Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Historical Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209145731/http://www.bobjenny-artist.com/nas/history.htm |date=2008-02-09 }} website discussing history of the facility: During 1942 the Merle Fogg Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida was selected by the United States Navy to be improved into a naval aviation facility.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional facilities were used to train aircraft maintenance and other ground crew support for the TBF and TBM series aircraft.&lt;ref name="NASFtLaudhist"/&gt; Among the Avenger pilots who graduated NAS Fort Lauderdale was former President [[George H. W. Bush]], from a class in 1943.&lt;ref name="NASFtLaudhist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FSU"&gt;Florida military bases, from [http://www.fsu.edu/~ww2/fl_during_ww2/florida_military_bases.htm FSU] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218150553/http://www.fsu.edu/~ww2/fl_during_ww2/florida_military_bases.htm |date=2007-12-18 }} Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale was one of the bases where former President George Bush received his training.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several airfields in the immediate vicinity of NAS Fort Lauderdale were commissioned as Navy satellite airfields, also known as outlying fields (OLF).  Several of these fields continue in operation today as civilian airports, such as [[Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport]] and [[North Perry Airport]]. 

TBF /TBM training was difficult and dangerous. From 1942 through 1946, 94 trainees lost their lives while serving at NAS Fort Lauderdale. Fourteen of those men made up a five-aircraft flight, now known as [[Flight 19]], that disappeared while on a routine training mission on December 5, 1945.&lt;ref name="NASFtLaudhist"/&gt; The need to train Avenger crews having passed, the station was decommissioned after 1946 and the facility was conveyed to the government of [[Broward County, Florida]] for use as a civilian airport.  Today the facility is known as [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport]].

'''Oskar Hermann Khristian Spate''' (30 March 1911{{spaced ndash}}29 May 2000) was a geographer best known for his role in strengthening [[geography]] as a discipline in [[Australia]] and the [[Pacific]].

==Early life==

Spate was born to a German father and an English mother in the [[Bloomsbury]] district of [[London]], [[England]]. During the [[World War I|First World War]], his father was interned as a German national and Spate fled to [[Iowa]] in the [[United States]]. He returned to England in 1919, where he developed an early interest in geography and history. He went on to study at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in the 1930s. It was during this period that many of Spate's characteristic personality traits revealed themselves: he studied both English as well as Geography, thus cementing a deeply humanistic tendency that would become obvious in his future thinking. His irreverence and sense of humor was also manifest as well – he joined a Communist cell but was thrown out for his frivolity. He was later to claim that he could be 'solemn but not serious'. His doctoral dissertation was on the historical geography of London from 1801 to 1851.

==Career==
Spate's dissertation was admired, but his strong political beliefs made an academic career in England unlikely. After a year as a tutor in Reading, he took up a position at the University of Rangoon in [[Myanmar]] (then Burma) in 1937. There he became interested in the colonial struggle for independence, and produced a steady stream of high-quality work on the geography of Myanmar. When [[World War II]] broke out, Spate joined he army as a volunteer and was seriously injured in the first Japanese raid on the Rangoon airport. He was evacuated to [[India]], where he recuperated, wrote poetry, and served in the unusual capacity of a military censor. In 1944, he moved to the Inter-Service Topographical Department in [[New Delhi]] (and later [[Kandy]], [[Sri Lanka]]) where he was a major in charge of the section of the office dealing with Burma.

In 1947, Spate returned to England, where he served briefly as a lecturer at the [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College for Women]], which was part of the [[University of London]] before taking up a permanent position at the [[London School of Economics]]. Spate appeared to have achieved a comfortable and prestigious academic position as a specialist in South Asian geography – it was during this time he was involved in the creation of the book ''The Changing Face of Asia'' and served on the [[Punjab Boundary Commission]] that was involved in the partition of [[Pakistan]] from [[India]]. However, Spate left England in 1951 to become the Foundation Professor of Geography at the newly established [[Australian National University]]. Spate was given ''carte blanche'' to organize the department and train students, and ended up having a large impact on geography as a discipline in Australia. In 1954, his work ''India and Pakistan: A General and Regional Geography'' was released to wide acclaim as one of the most magisterial and complete geographies of the country.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Firmly established as an expert in South Asia, Spate turned his attention to Australia and the Pacific more broadly.

In 1953, Spate became an advisor to the Australian Minister for Territories, for whom he produced important papers on the economy and demography of [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Fiji]]. His 1959 report on ''The Fijian People'' was particularly notable, because it became the document that guided how colonial administers handled the process of Fiji's independence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} In 1969, he served on the commission that recommended the creation of the [[University of Papua New Guinea]]. By the 1960s, the discipline of geography was growing more quantitative. Spate's more humanistic tendencies made him uncomfortable with these trends and in 1967 he became the director of the Australian National University's [[Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies]] (RSPAS), a more administrative position which allowed him to avoid entanglement in disciplinary debates. He served in this capacity until his retirement in 1972, when he took up a position in the Department of Pacific History. He retired in 1976 and began writing his master work, a monumental three-volume history of the Pacific, ''The Spanish Lake: The Pacific Since Magellan''. He died in 2000 at the age of 89.

A '''stereoplotter''' uses [[Stereoscopy|stereo photograph]]s to determine [[elevation]]s. It has been the primary method to plot [[contour line]]s on [[topographic map]]s since the 1930s. Although the specific devices have advanced technologically, they are all based on the apparent change in position of a feature in the two stereo photographs.

Stereoplotters have changed as technology has improved. The first stereoplotters where projection stereoplotters they used only the [[light beam|light rays]] and optics to adjust the image. The Kelsh Plotter is an example of the projection stereoplotters. The analog stereoplotters came next and were more sophisticated in that they used more sophisticated optics to view the image. The analytical stereoplotter is used today. It incorporates a computer which does the work of mathematically aligning the images so that they line up properly. The analytic stereoplotter also allows for storing the data and redrawing at any desired scale.

{{TOC right}}

== Analogical ==
The stereoplotter requires two [[photograph]]s that have considerable overlap (60%) and are corrected for distortion due to angle of photo. The photos are put onto transparent media and projected with a light source. Each image will be projected with overlap on the other. The operator, using a special set of [[optics]], would then see the image as three-dimensional due to the differing perspective of each photo.

The optics of the stereoplotter is what allows the operator to plot the contours and features. The light source used to project the photo is what begins the process. One photo is projected using [[cyan]]/blue filter and the other photo is projected with a red filter. The operator wears a special set of [[glasses]] that have the same color filter for lenses. Seeing the left photo in blue light while the left eye has the blue filter and the right photo projected with red light and the right eye seeing through the red filter, the overlapping image becomes three-dimensional. The images will have control points that detail how the overlap of the photos should occur. The resultant overlapping image is called an [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyph]] and is a [[3D modeling|three-dimensional model]] of the [[terrain]]. Once the two photos are projected and the desired control points aligned the operator will then start to record the desired elevations on the terrain by "flying" a light spot along the contours.  If the light spot appears to hover above the terrain or appears to dive into the terrain, the operator knows that he has moved it too far away from a slope or too far toward a slope, respectively.

Originally, stereoplotters recorded the path of the flying light spot by directly scribing the path on a sheet of acetate or polyester coated with an opaque lacquer, which could be photographed to make the topographic map printing plates.  If mistakes were made during contour tracing, the operator would daub some lacquer on the incorrect trace, allow it to dry and then try flying the light spot again.  Current systems that use digital capture techniques allow simple erasure of part of the faulty data vector in computer memory, whereupon digitizing can resume.  The digital database is then combined in a graphics program with annotations and symbols, ultimately being used to produce the map printing plates with a [[photoplotter]].

The stereoplotter serves an important need of allowing aerial photos to become the base for [[contour line|contour]]s and [[elevation]] maps. In the United States the largest use of topographic maps is the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS). The USGS has cataloged all of the territory of the United States and has produced topographic sheets for all of it. The sheets are most often used as 7.5' maps. This means there is 7.5' (0.125 degree) [[latitude]] by 7.5' (0.125 degree) [[longitude]].

== Analytical ==
With the introduction of computers, the '''analytical stereoplotter''' became a popular machine of choice [[photogrammetry]] in the late 1960s to 1970s. A stereoplotter is an instrument that uses stereo photographs to determine elevations for the purpose of creating contours on [[topographic map]]s. Computers brought the capability to execute more precise calculations that ensure additional accurate output instead of approximations. This innovation also allowed a shift to a digital format rather than paper. Analytical stereoplotters edged out their analog predecessors and became the primary method of acquiring [[elevation]] data from [[Stereoscopy|stereo photographs]].

Analytical stereoplotters use a mathematical projection based on the [[Collinearity equation|co-linearity]] (two vectors pointing in the same direction) equation model. The mechanical element of the instrument is a very accurate, computer-controlled device that compares two photographs simultaneously. The measurement system can be made to create a precise measurement for images because the photo stages only move via the x and y [[Coordinates (geographic)|coordinates]] that are programmed into the system. The Kelsh stereoplotter by comparison, was built with a fixed focal distance and [[focal length]] of lens for projection. The ratio for scale was also fixed. In contrast, the analytical stereoplotter has no substantial limitations on focal length or [[Map scale|scale]].

The analytical stereoplotters viewing system has an optical train system, which usually includes the ability to change the focal length of a camera by adjusting the lens. Style, size and color of the measuring mark can be adjusted in viewing system as well. There is also an illumination adjustment to each eye.

The analytical stereoplotter measuring system is made up of an input device for the operator to move the elevation point in three dimensions. The input device is programmed, and the digital measure of the elevation point deviation is sent to the computer. With this information, the program then is able to set and locate points for both the interior and exterior of the elevation and record measurements. The transfer of information is immediate and thus the person operating the machine is able to make any necessary adjustments to the coordinates.

Elevations are measured in three steps, that include first measuring the interior orientation, then the relative orientation, and finally the absolute orientation. Interior orientation photographs are placed in relation to the center of the stereoplotter by aligning the fixed standard of reference points for measurement to corresponding points on the photograph. The focal length of the camera is also set. With relative orientation the angle of orientation of the camera relative to the place where the photos were, the stereo-photo is taken programmed in the stereoplotter. This allows the effects of parallax (distortion of the final stereo-photo) to be reduced. In absolute orientation, the ground coordinates of a position are used to scale the model. You can use this to get the x, y, or z coordinates of any position on the stereo photographs. This information can be used for the construction of  [[contour line]]s for topographic maps.

== Future outlook ==
[[Lidar]] (light radar) has complemented and often times replaced the stereoplotter for gathering elevation data. Lidar uses a laser pulse directed at features and detects the amount of time between when the pulse is emitted and when it is detected to determine the difference in elevations.

Iraq area codes can be 1 or 2 digits (not counting the trunk prefix 0) and the subscriber numbers are usually 6 digits. In Baghdad and some other governorates, they are 7 digits. The mobile numbers have 10 digits, beginning with the 3-digit code of each operator followed by 7 digits.

==Dialing procedure==
A call from outside Iraq would have the following dialing format when calling a:

Numbers on the Irish Telephone Numbering Plan are regulated and assigned to operators by [[Commission for Communications Regulation|ComReg]].

==Overview and history==

Telephone numbers in Ireland are part of an open numbering plan that allows variations in number length. The Irish format is similar to systems used in many parts of Europe, notably the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom. Mobile and non-geographic numbers, however, are fixed length and do not support local dialling.

Ireland uses the trunk prefix &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to access numbers outside your local area. This is followed by an area code, referred to as an NDC (National Dialling Code.) The first digit of the NDC indicates the geographical area or type of service (e.g. mobile).

Calls made from mobile phones and some VoIP systems, always require the full area code and phone number.
In common with most European countries, the trunk prefix &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; must be omitted when calling Irish numbers from abroad.

=== General structure of Irish numbering ===

Irish area codes vary in length, between one and three digits (excluding the leading 0), and subscribers' numbers are between five and seven digits. A migration to a standard format, &lt;code&gt;(0xx)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;xxx&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;xxxx&lt;/code&gt;, is in progress; however, to avoid disruption, this process is only being carried out as needed where existing area codes and local numbering systems have reached full capacity. There is currently no plan to move to a closed numbering system.

===Overview===

==== Geographically assigned ====
{{main|List of Irish dialling codes}}

Irish geographical numbering is structured on a regional basis and follows a logical hierarchy. Two-digit telephone directory areas are divided into multiple area codes called NDCs (National Dialling Codes).

These directory areas correspond approximately to the following geographical regions: 01 - Greater Dublin, 02 - South (Cork), 04 (North East), 05 (South East) 06 (Midwest/Southwest), 07 (Northwest), 09 (West). The midlands area is covered by several regional codes.

Except for the 01 area, each area is further subdivided into smaller areas (NDCs). Usually, the main city or town in the area is 0X1. (Cork 021, Limerick 061, Galway 091 etc.)

[[ComReg]] maintains a map of area codes [https://www.comreg.ie/licensing_and_services/area_code_maps.552.1040.html here].

=== Mobile services ===
Mobile phone numbers start with the 08x prefix and is part of a closed numbering plan. This means that a mobile phone number must have 10 digits. Calls to landlines, and the like, require the area code on mobile phone.

New numbers are assigned on prefixes and ranges managed by a specific operator, however, as full [[Mobile number portability]] has been in operation since 2003, it is no longer possible to reliably identify which network a particular number is on. For example, a newly assigned [[3 Ireland]] number would begin with 083, however it may have been ported to another operator.

===Direct to voicemail number===
Mobile phone numbers in Ireland have their own voicemail number. To access this, the number '''5''' should be put after the prefix. For example, the mobile number &lt;code&gt;08X&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;4567&lt;/code&gt;, its voicemail number would be &lt;code&gt;08X&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;'''5'''&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;123&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;4567&lt;/code&gt;.

On some networks, when the direct to voicemail number is called, the voicemail greeting is played (e.g. Vodafone, Meteor, etc.), while others request a phone number, then the voicemail greeting is played for that number (e.g. Three Ireland). Users can press the hash key (#) to gain access to the voicemail box.

==Calls to Northern Ireland==
Although Northern Ireland is part of the [[Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom|UK (+44) numbering plan]], a special arrangement exists for calling Northern Ireland landlines from the Republic of Ireland. Calls to Northern Ireland can be dialled using the 048 prefix or by dialling the number in the full international format. Most Irish operators treat calls to Northern Ireland at national or even local rates. Similar charging arrangements apply when calling the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland.

For example, to reach Belfast landline 90xx xxxx subscribers can dial either:

'''048''' 90xx xxxx

or

'''00 44 28''' 90xx xxxx

Northern Irish mobile phones use the same mobile numbering and networks as other parts of the [[Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom#Mobile telephones|UK]] — calls must be dialled using the 00 44 7xxx xxx xxx format.

==International calls==

In common with all EU countries, the international access code is 00.
Call should be dialled as follows:

'''00''' [[List of country calling codes|Country Code]] Area code (if any) - local number

Mobile phones may also use + instead of the 00 international access code.

== Reserved numbers ==
*'''03''' – reserved for future changes in the numbering plan.
*'''07''' — all except ''0707'', ''0700'', ''071'', ''074'' and ''076'' are reserved without assigned purpose.
*'''0707''' — Reserved for personal numbering.
*'''0800''' — Reserved

== Special numbers ==
*'''00''' — International access.
*'''020 91x xxxx''' — [[Fictitious telephone number|Drama use]] (although the rest of the 020 area code is free).
*'''0700''' — Personal Numbering.
*'''076''' — [[Voice over IP]] services.
*'''080''' — Mailbox for landline users (Formerly NI access code).

== Operator services ==
General operator assistance no longer exists in Ireland.  It used to be available by dialling 10 from within Ireland.  
*'''118xx''' — Directory Enquiries (Multiple commercial providers offer a variety of services in this number range)

== Emergency services ==
The emergency number for Ireland is [[112 (emergency telephone number)|112]]. This is harmonised across the EU. 
999, the well-known historic emergency number, is also used alongside 112. Either number can be dialed.

===Services provided===
*Ambulance
*[[Garda Síochána]] ([[Police]])
*Fire and Rescue
*Marine and Coastal Emergency Service
*Cliff and Mountain Rescue

===SMS Emergency Service===
Deaf or hard of hearing customers can send an SMS message to 112.

Further information can be found at [https://www.112.ie/112_SMS_Service/142 112.ie].

==Premium Rate Numbers==

===Premium Rate Voice===
Irish premium rate telephone numbers start with &lt;code&gt;15&lt;/code&gt; and are read in two digit blocks e.g. 1550 is "fifteen fifty".
The rates given below are from ComReg and are indicative only. Please check with your specific telephone service provider for exact rates.

*'''171''' - Used to access voicemail on all networks: fixed line (POTS and Cable), all mobile operators and many VoIP providers.

== Call management services / supplementary service codes ==
Special short codes are used to control various supplementary services offered by digital local exchanges. These services were first introduced as 'PhonePlus' in 1981 on the first generation of Alcatel E10 and Ericsson AXE digital exchanges used in Ireland and were rolled out nationally throughout the 1980s. 
These services are available on all Irish PSTN lines, regardless of operator. There is a more expansive range of services available, but these are the most commonly used. Different codes apply on cable telephony lines, such as those provided by [[Virgin Media Ireland]] and on  VoIP providers.

=== Possible future changes ===

Dublin numbers are currently seven digits, but may change to eight digits in the future, although breaking the city into separate area codes would match the rest of the national system. A review and public consultation on the future of Ireland's numbering plan was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comreg.ie/publications/the_evolution_of_geographic_telephone_numbering_in_ireland.583.104522.p.html The Evolution of Geographic Telephone Numbering in Ireland], [[ComReg]], 19 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical codes to access numbers in Great Britain===

Until the early 1990s, the '''03''' numbering range was originally used for calls to [[Great Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZvskAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ireland%22+%2203%22+%22Britain%22+%22telephone%22+%22dial%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Special+Dialing-Out+Access+Code+to+Great+Britain+is+03%22 ''Multinational Executive Travel Companion''], Guides to Multinational Business, 1992, page 244&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]], with the Irish prefix '''030''' replacing the UK trunk code '''0'''.&lt;ref name="Festivals" /&gt; Calls to British cities using the [[Director telephone system]] were also possible using shorter codes:

* '''031''' — London (01)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eo1DAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Ireland%22+%22London%22+%22031%22&amp;dq=%22Ireland%22+%22London%22+%22031%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW3JSqoZjdAhUpJMAKHQZrBJUQ6AEIKTAA ''Ireland: A Directory''], Jim O'Donnell, Institute of Public Administration, 1985, page 18&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''032''' — [[Birmingham]] (021)&lt;ref name="IPA1980" /&gt;

* '''035''' — [[Liverpool]] (051)&lt;ref name="IPA1980" /&gt;
* '''036''' — [[Manchester]] (061)&lt;ref name="IPA1980"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PctWAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ireland%22+%22Birmingham%22+%22032%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Birmingham+032%22 ''Ireland, Administration Yearbook and Diary''], Institute of Public Administration, 1980, page 333&lt;/ref&gt; 

When London was split into two area codes, 071 and 081 in 1990, 031 was replaced with the codes '''03071'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=662&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1900%2Ccd_max%3A1999&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=y8WJW9W6K8KtgAarhoLYBw&amp;q=%22Ireland%22+%22London%22+%22%2803071%29+2352171%22&amp;oq=%22Ireland%22+%22London%22+%22%2803071%29+2352171%22&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...42674.42674.0.44226.1.1.0.0.0.0.64.64.1.1.0....0...1c.2.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.Jg4lrLctOKw ''State Directory''], Stationery Office, 1992, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; and '''03081'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J3PpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Ireland%22+%22London%22+%2203081%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%2203081%22 ''Benn's Media Directory''], Benn, 1992, page 292&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

Use of the 03 range for this purpose was discontinued in 1993, when the international access code changed from '''16''' to '''00''', with calls to Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) requiring the country code '''44''' and the area code in full.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jrp83_yl27YC&amp;q=%22Ireland%22+%22London%22+%22004471%22&amp;dq=%22Ireland%22+%22London%22+%22004471%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwillv_rs5jdAhUI74MKHU_JCWsQ6AEIKTAA ''Ireland''], Institute of Public Administration, 1994, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5083">The '''Third Border Initiative''' ('''TBI''') is an area of policy concerning [[United States]] and [[the Caribbean]] region.  The phrase was especially made popular by the administration of the President of the United States [[George W. Bush]].  The Third Border Initiative was a reference to the Caribbean region's adjacent placement to the United States of America.  The policy is the ideology that behind [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] the Caribbean region is a Sea-based border of the United States.

==Overview==
The initiative also builds upon the founding of the Caribbean/United States - [[Partnership for Prosperity and Security in the Caribbean]] (1997). An agreement which is sometimes called the "Bridgetown Accord".  This agreement is also complimented with other agreements for Maritime co-operation between the United States and countries of the Caribbean region.  These other agreements include: the ''Maritime Counter-Narcotics Co-operation Agreement'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bureaus/lat/1996/960301BurnsTrinidad1.html |title=TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO - SIGNING OF EXTRADITION AND MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATIES - MARITIME COUNTER-DRUG COOPERATION AGREEMENT |author=U.S. State Department |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 4, 1996 |month= |year= |work= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote= |ref=96/03/01 Statement: Extradition/Maritime Treaties, Trinidad/Tobago |separator= |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Maritime Counter-Narcotics ("Shiprider") Agreement'' (1997), and the [[Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative]]. Many of these agreements were signed between the Clinton Administration of the United States, and the various independent countries of the Caribbean region in May 1997.

'''TopSat''' ('''T'''actical '''Op'''erational '''Sat'''ellite) is a British Earth observation [[satellite]], currently in [[Low Earth Orbit]]. The nanosatellite was launched in October 2005 alongside the [[Beijing-1 (satellite)|Beijing-1]] [[Disaster Monitoring Constellation]] satellite by a Cosmos rocket from [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TopSat|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/ukspaceagency/missions/topsat-proving-uk-technology|publisher=UK Space Agency|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
TopSat carries out imaging with a ground resolution of 2.5 m. Much smaller and cheaper than other imaging satellites of similar high resolution, TopSat has been used to demonstrate the feasibility of providing images on demand to portable ground stations, such as that which might be deployed by the military or another disaster relief organisation.

TopSat was built in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]], [[QinetiQ]] and The [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] under the [[British National Space Centre]] Mosaic programme. The engineering model of TopSat now lives in the space gallery of London's [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.co.uk/DataBank/Transcripts/20080329DrStuartEves/tabid/437/Default.aspx Space.co.uk Transcript: Stuart Eves interviewed at the 2008 UK Space Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209053407/http://www.space.co.uk/DataBank/Transcripts/20080329DrStuartEves/tabid/437/Default.aspx |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TopSat won the 2006 [[Popular Science]] "Best of What's New" Grand Award in the Aviation and Space category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/popsci/flat/bown/2006/product_2.html Popular Science "Best of What's New" Grand Award, Science and Technology] to TopSat.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''total station''' ('''TS''') or '''total station theodolite''' ('''TST''') is an electronic/optical instrument used for [[surveying]] and [[Construction|building construction]].  It is an electronic  transit [[theodolite]] integrated with [[Rangefinder|electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) to measure both vertical and horizontal angles and the slope distance from the instrument to a particular point, and an on-board computer to collect data and perform [[triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]] calculations.&lt;ref name="KavanaghBird1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Barry F. |last2=Bird|first2=S. J. Glenn |title=Surveying: Principles and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Io8rAQAAMAAJ|edition=4th|year=1996|publisher=Prentice Hall|pp=257-264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robotic]] or motorized total stations allow the operator to control the instrument from a distance via remote control. This eliminates the need for an assistant staff member as the operator holds the [[retroreflector]] and controls the total station from the observed point. These motorized total stations can also be used in automated setups knows as Automated Motorized Total Station (AMTS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Passagen und Passanten, Shopping Malls und Konsumentinnen |url=List of shopping malls in Finland |website=Shopping Malls |publisher=VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften |accessdate=21 November 2018 |pages=55–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

=== Angle measurement ===

Most total station instruments measure angles by means of electro-optical scanning of extremely precise digital bar-codes etched on rotating glass cylinders or discs within the instrument. The best quality total stations are capable of measuring angles to 0.5 [[arc-second]]. Inexpensive "construction grade" total stations can generally measure angles to 5 or 10 arc-seconds.

=== Distance measurement ===
{{main|Distance measurement}}

Measurement of distance is accomplished with a modulated  [[infrared]] carrier signal, generated by a small solid-state emitter within the instrument's optical path, and reflected by a prism reflector or the object under survey. The modulation pattern in the returning signal is read and interpreted by the computer in the total station. The distance is determined by emitting and receiving multiple frequencies, and determining the integer number of [[wavelengths]] to the target for each [[frequency]]. Most total stations use purpose-built glass [[prism (surveying)]] reflectors for the EDM signal. A typical total station can measure distances with an accuracy of about {{convert|1.5|mm|ft|sp=us}} + 2 parts per million over a distance of up to {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leica-geosystems.us/en/Construction-Surveying-TPS-Leica-FlexLine-TS020609_72053.htm ''Leica Flexline TS02/06/09'']. (2008). Leica Geosystems. See datasheet for model TS06 (PDF). Retrieved 27 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectorless total stations can measure distances to any object that is reasonably light in color, up to a few hundred [[metre|meters]].

=== Coordinate measurement ===

The coordinates of an unknown point relative to a known coordinate can be determined using the total station as long as a direct line of sight can be established between the two points. Angles and distances are measured from the total station to points under survey, and the [[coordinate]]s (X, Y, and Z or easting, northing and [[elevation]]) of surveyed points relative to the total station position are calculated using [[trigonometry]] and [[triangulation]].
To determine an absolute location a Total Station requires line of sight observations and can be set up over a known point or with line of sight to 2 or more points with known location, called [[Resection (Free Stationing)|free stationing]].&lt;ref name = TS11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leica-geosystems.us/common/shared/downloads/inc/downloader.asp?id=14376 | date = n.d. | title = Leica Viva TS11 Datasheet | publisher = Leica Geosystems - Americas | accessdate = June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Free Stationing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose, Advantage, and Objective of Resection Setup|url=http://trl.trimble.com/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-406432/SC_Purpose,%20advantage%20and%20objective%20of%20resection%20setup.htm|website=Trimble Knowledge Center|publisher=Trimble|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, some total stations also have a [[GNSS|Global Navigation Satellite System]] receiver and do not require a direct line of sight to determine coordinates. However, GNSS measurements may require longer occupation periods and offer relatively poor accuracy in the vertical axis.&lt;ref name = TS11/&gt;

=== Data processing ===

Some models include internal electronic data storage to record distance, horizontal angle, and vertical angle measured, while other models are equipped to write these measurements to an external [[data logger|data collector]], such as a hand-held computer.

When data is downloaded from a total station onto a computer, application software can be used to compute results and generate a [[map]] of the surveyed area. The newest generation of total stations can also show the map on the touch-screen of the instrument immediately after measuring the points.

== Applications ==

Total stations are mainly used by [[land surveyor]]s and [[civil engineers]], either to record features as in topographic surveying or to set out features (such as roads, houses or boundaries). They are also used by archaeologists to record excavations and by police, crime scene investigators, private accident reconstructionists and insurance companies to take measurements of scenes.  

=== Mining ===
Total stations are the primary survey instrument used in [[mining]] surveying.

A total station is used to record the absolute location of the tunnel walls, ceilings (backs), and floors as the [[drift (mining)|drifts]] of an underground mine are driven. The recorded data are then downloaded into a [[CAD program]], and compared to the designed layout of the tunnel.

The survey party installs control stations at regular intervals. These are small steel plugs installed in pairs in holes drilled into walls or the back. For wall stations, two plugs are installed in opposite walls, forming a line perpendicular to the drift. For back stations, two plugs are installed in the back, forming a line parallel to the drift.

A set of plugs can be used to locate the total station set up in a drift or tunnel by processing measurements to the plugs by intersection and [[Resection (orientation)|resection]].

=== Mechanical and electrical construction ===
Total stations have become the highest standard for most forms of construction layout.{{According to whom|date=December 2016}}

They are most often used in the X and Y axis to lay out the locations of penetrations out of the underground utilities into the foundation, between floors of a structure, as well as roofing penetrations.

Because more commercial and industrial construction jobs have become centered around [[building information modeling]] (BIM), the coordinates for almost every pipe, conduit, duct and hanger support are available with digital precision.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2016}} The application of communicating a virtual model to a tangible construction potentially eliminates labor costs related to moving poorly measured systems, as well as time spent laying out these systems in the midst of a full blown construction job in progress.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Meteorology===
[[Meteorologists]] also use total stations to track [[weather balloon]]s for determining upper-level winds.  With the average ascent rate of the weather balloon known or assumed, the change in azimuth and elevation readings provided by the total station as it tracks the weather balloon over time are used to compute the wind speed and direction at different altitudes.  Additionally, the total station is used to track ceiling balloons to determine the height of cloud layers.  Such upper-level wind data is often used for aviation weather forecasting and rocket launches.

The '''Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle''' was a three-day [[academic conference]] where the [[precautionary principle]] was defined. The January 1998 meeting took place at [[Wingspread]], headquarters of the [[Johnson Foundation]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], and involved 35 [[scientists]], [[lawyers]], policy makers and [[environmentalists]] from the United States, Canada and Europe.&lt;ref name="mindfully"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
{{main|Precautionary principle}}

The formal concept evolved out of the German socio-legal tradition in the 1930s, centering on the concept of good household management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agobservatory.org/library.cfm?refID=30236&lt;/ref&gt; In German the concept is ''Vorsorgeprinzip'', which translates into English as ''precaution principle''.

Many of the concepts underpinning the precautionary principle pre-date the term's inception. For example, the essence of the principle is captured in a number of cautionary [[aphorism]]s such as "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure", "better safe than sorry", and "look before you leap".&lt;ref&gt;http://rachel.org/?q=en/node/3850&lt;/ref&gt; The precautionary principle may also be interpreted as the evolution of the ancient medical principle of "[[Primum non nocere|first, do no harm]]" to apply to institutions and institutional decision-making processes rather than individuals.

==Final statement==
In the final text of the agreement, it was agreed that the [[precautionary principle]] could be summarized as
&lt;blockquote&gt;cv 
When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically.&lt;ref name="official-pr"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = 
  | first = 
  | authorlink = 
  | coauthors = 
  | title = Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle
  | work = 
  | publisher = The Science and Environmental Health Network 
  | date = January 26, 1998
  | url = http://www.sehn.org/wing.html
  | format = 
  | doi = 
  | accessdate = October 25, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The members also concluded that current [[environmental policies]] do not do enough to prevent environmental disasters instead of controlling damage after an incident.

==Follow up committees==
The February 2, 2000 [[European Commission Communication on the Precautionary Principle]] notes: "The precautionary principle applies where scientific evidence is insufficient, inconclusive or uncertain and preliminary scientific evaluation indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potentially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection chosen by the EU".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.progressiveregulation.org/perspectives/precaution.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The January 29, 2000 [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] says: "Lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information ... shall not prevent the Party of import, in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects, from taking a decision, as appropriate, with regard to the import of the living modified organism in question."

'''Yumen Pass''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|玉门|关}}|t={{linktext|玉門|關}}|p=Yùmén Guān}}), or '''Jade Gate''' or '''Pass of the Jade Gate''', is the name of a [[Mountain pass|pass]] of the [[Great Wall]] located west of [[Dunhuang]] in today's [[Gansu]] Province of [[China]]. During the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC - AD 220), this was a pass through which the [[Silk Road]] passed, and was the one road connecting [[Central Asia]] and China, the former called the [[Western Regions]]. Just to the south was the [[Yangguan]] pass, which was also an important point on the Silk Road.

Although the Chinese ''guan'' is usually translated simply as "pass", its more specific meaning is a "frontier pass" to distinguish it from an ordinary pass through the mountains. ''Yumen guan'' 玉門關 and ''Yang guan'' 陽關 are derived from: ''yu'' 玉 = 'jade' + ''men'' 門 = 'gate', 'door'; and ''yang'' 陽 = 'sunny side', 'south side of a hill', 'north side of a river,' and ''guan'' 關 = ‘frontier-passes’. These were the two most famous passes leading to the north and west from Chinese territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hill|2015|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Early Han, "... a defensive line was established from Jiuquan ('Wine Springs') in the ''Gansu'' Corridor west to the Jade Gate Pass at its end." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mallory|Mair|2000|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not to be confused with the city [[Yumen City|Yumen]] (玉門, literally ''Jade Gate'') in Gansu, China. Although both are within the same [[Jiuquan]] "[[prefecture-level city]]" (a multi-county administrative unit) of Gansu province, Yumen Pass is located some 400&amp;nbsp;km to the west of its namesake city.

==History==
{{quote|Travellers to 'The Western Regions' (西域, Xiyu) left China through the famous Yumenguan 玉門關, or 'Jade Gate Frontier-post,' named for the many jade caravans that passed through it. The original Jade Gate was erected by Emperor Wudi ([[Emperor Wu of Han]]) soon after 121 BCE and its ruins may still be seen about {{convert|80|km|mi}} to the northwest of [[Dunhuang]] which was, until the 6th century, the final outpost of Chinese territory for caravans on their long caravan journeys to India, [[Parthia]], and the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hill|2009|p=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The remains of these two important [[Han dynasty|Han-dynasty]] gates are about {{convert|68|km|mi}} apart, at either end of the Dunhuang extension of the Great Wall. Until the [[Tang dynasty]], when the gates fell into disuse, all caravans travelling through Dunhuang were required to pass through one of these gates, then the westernmost passes of China. Yumenguan lies about {{convert|80|km|mi}} northwest of Dunhuang. It was originally called the 'Square City,' but because the great [[jade]] [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] from [[Hotan|Khotan]] entered through its portals, it became known as the Jade Gate Pass. In the third and fourth centuries turmoil swept through Central Asia, disrupting overland trade, and the sea route via India began to supplant it. By the sixth century, as caravans favoured the northern route via [[Hami City|Hami]], the pass was abandoned. In 1907, Sir [[Aurel Stein]] found bamboo slips naming the site as Yumenguan, and in 1944 Chinese archaeologists discovered relics that confirmed this. With its 10-metre-high (32 foot) mud walls pierced by four gateways, the square enclosure covered more than 600 square metres (718 square yards) in the midst of unbounded desolation. Yanguan lies {{convert|75|km|mi}} southwest of Dunhuang but consists of only the ruins of a high beacon tower. ...|{{harvp|Bonavia|Baumer|2004|pp=176, 178}}. Quoted in {{harvp|Hill|2009|p=138}}.}}
