On 15 May 2008 a '''pipeline explosion''' occurred in the community of [[Ijegun]], a suburb north of [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]. The explosion took place after a bulldozer struck an oil pipeline.&lt;ref name="100 killed in fire after roadworkers fracture fuel pipeline in Ijegun"&gt;{{cite news

The fire started from the Isolo end of Ijegun, which spread to surrounding homes and schools. It reportedly spread through buildings with occupants inside. The Ijegun Primary School was also damaged. More than 15 homes and more than 20 vehicles were burned in the fire. Firefighters and volunteers used sand and water in attempts to extinguish the fires.&lt;ref name="Oil pipeline explosion kills at least 100"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23707514-401,00.html |title=Oil pipeline explosion kills at least 100 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2008-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519222941/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C23707514-401%2C00.html |archivedate=May 19, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty minutes after the fire started, [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation|NNPC]] (Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation) firefighters arrived on the scene.

==Deaths==
Although the Nigerian Emergency Management Agency puts the current death toll at ten, the [[Nigerian Red Cross]] claims at least 100 people have died. Other accounts state that the number dead is 39, including school children.&lt;ref name="Nigeria: 39 Die in Lagos Pipeline Fire"&gt;{{cite web

The [[Nigerian Red Cross]] compiled names of the deceased and injured. They set up camps near the disaster as well.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's believed that when the explosion occurred, gate men at the Ijegun Primary School initially locked the gates apparently to prevent the pupils from running into danger. But when the atmosphere became tense, the gate men and other staff were said to have run for their lives leaving everyone to their fate.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"/&gt;

At that point, students from Ijegun Comprehensive School who ran into the primary school premises were said to have jointly brought down the wall of the school to facilitate their escape.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"/&gt; Most of them were trampled on. Eight out of sixteen pupils who were rushed to Corner Stone Hospital reportedly died on 15 May and another died a day later.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"/&gt; Three residents were killed after being run over by vehicles whose drivers attempted to flee the fire zone.&lt;ref name="allafrica.com"/&gt;

'''50Hertz Transmission GmbH''' (former name: '''Vattenfall Europe Transmission''') is one of the four [[transmission system operator]]s for electricity in [[Germany]]. It is a member of the [[European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity]] (ENTSO-E).  It is wholly owned by Eurogrid GmbH, indirectly owned and managed by the Belgian transmission system operator [[Elia System Operator]] and Australian-based [[IFM Investors]].

The company has headquarters in Berlin and owns the high power network in eastern Germany as well as the area around [[Hamburg]]. It operates the 220kV and 380kV networks and has about 10,200&amp;nbsp;km of power lines covering about 30% of Germany by area. The company employs 1.043 employees.

On 12 March 2010, Elia System Operator and Industry Funds Management acquired 50Hertz Transmission from [[Vattenfall]]. The deal was approved by the [[European Commission]] on 10 May 2010.

On 23 March 2018, Elia announced it has decided to exercise its pre-emption right and to increase its share in Eurogrid, the holding company above 50Hertz, from 60% to 80%. The transaction price amounts to € 976.5 million.&lt;ref name=eliapressrelease&gt;{{cite web|title=Elia Press Release |url=https://www.eliagroup.eu/News/Detail/id/4667/elia-has-decided-to-acquire-an-additional-20-stake-in-german-transmission-system-operator-50hertz|website=eliagroup.eu|publisher=Elia Group|accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Elia announced the closing of the transactions with IFM and the German state-owned bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau ([[KfW]]) regarding a 20% stake in Eurogrid International.

The '''Airship ''NS11'' crash''' was an [[airship]] accident which occurred on 15 July 1919. The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) airship exploded off the east coast of [[England]] over the [[North Sea]], killing all nine crew on board.

==Aircraft==
''NS11'' was one of 14 [[NS class airship|''North Sea''-class]] airships ordered by the Royal Navy for the [[Royal Naval Air Service]], but by the time ''NS11'' was delivered in September 1918, the Royal Naval Air Service had been amalgamated with the [[Royal Flying Corps]] to form the RAF. The airship was built and tested at [[RNAS Kingsnorth]] near [[Kingsnorth (Medway)|Kingsnorth]] in [[Kent]]. She was fitted with two 260&amp;nbsp;hp (195&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Fiat]] engines and had an [[Airship#Envelope|envelope]] with a capacity of {{convert|360000|ft3|m3|abbr=on}} cubic feet. Prior to the accident, she had made voyages of more than 1000&amp;nbsp;miles (1600&amp;nbsp;km) over the North Sea, setting a world record for non-rigid airships.&lt;ref name="NYT19190716p1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1919/07/16/archives/british-airship-burns-with-crew-twelve-lost-when-the-ns11-falls.html|title=British Airship Burns with Crew; Twelve Lost When the NS-11 Falls Flaming Into the North Sea|publisher= The New York Times|date= 16 July 1919|accessdate= 29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
''NS11'' had taken off from [[RAF Pulham]] in [[Pulham St Mary]], [[Norfolk]], around midnight on the night of 14/15 July 1919 and was heading over the [[North Sea]] on a [[Minehunter|mine-hunting patrol]].&lt;ref name="NYT19190716p1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NS11 - Local View"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ns11.org/loss-of-ns11-%E2%80%93-a-local-view/|title= NS11 - A Local View|accessdate= 29 October 2013|publisher= ns11.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early hours of 15 July, she was seen to fly beneath a long "greasy black cloud" off the village of [[Cley next the Sea]] on the Norfolk coast when locals reported an abnormal noise from her engines (which may have suggested she was experiencing engine trouble).&lt;ref name="NYT19190716p1" /&gt; She was returning towards the coast when she exploded into a ball of flames, causing a vivid glare lasting for several minutes as the burning airship descended, plunging into the sea after a second explosion. None of the nine crew members on board the airship survived.&lt;ref name="NYT19190716p1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NS11 - As Bright as Day"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ns11.org|title= NS11 - As Bright as Day|accessdate= 29 October 2013|publisher= ns11.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sheringham Lifeboat Station|Sheringham lifeboat]] was launched but its crew could only find a small part of the aluminium wreckage.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;"Airship Burnt At Sea." Times [London, England] 16 July 1919: 12. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 29 Oct. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident occurred less than 48 hours after the airship ''[[R33-class airship|R34]]'' arrived at RAF Pulham after a successful double-crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, including the first-ever east-west crossing by air.

==Cause==
The findings of the official Court of Enquiry were inconclusive, but amongst other possibilities it was thought that a lightning strike may have caused the explosion.&lt;ref name="NS11 - Local View" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
There is a memorial plaque and drinking fountain in the grounds of the Viaduct Sports &amp; Social Club in [[Earlestown]], [[Merseyside]]. The names of the crew are commemorated on Hollybrook Memorial, [[Southampton]]. One of the crew was buried at Ann’s Hill Cemetery in [[Gosport]].&lt;ref name="NS11 - Memorials"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ns11.org/the-last-crew/memorials/|title= NS11 - Memorials|accessdate= 29 October 2013|publisher=ns11.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1229">'''Antimony regulus'''  or '''antimony metal''' is a partially purified form of the element [[antimony]]. In modern commerce, it typically contains 0.4% to 1.0% of impurities, which typically include primarily [[arsenic]], and smaller amounts of [[sulfur]], [[zinc]] and [[iron]]. [[Selenium]] as an impurity is rare, but for some purposes must be avoided; other problematic impurities for various applications include [[copper]], [[nickel]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name="Ency"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iwSU5G5VzO0C&amp;pg=PA371&amp;lpg=PA371&amp;dq=%22antimony+regulus%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bjDRI8vcCe&amp;sig=pSePmomIcMTBQzAKDNEh2C6Mlsw&amp;hl=en#PPA371,M1 "Antimony and Antimony Alloys"], by Werner Joseph, pp. 370-372, in  ''Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design'', John J.

Typical commercial antimony is unsuitable for production of [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state-electronics]] devices, and for these 99.95% pure material is typically demanded.

The continent of '''Australia''', sometimes known in technical contexts by the names '''Sahul''', '''Australinea''' or '''Meganesia''' to distinguish it from the [[Australia|country of Australia]], consists of the land masses which sit on Australia's continental shelf. This includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, and the island of New Guinea (comprising Papua New Guinea and two Indonesian provinces).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://countrydigest.org/is-australia-a-country-or-a-continent/|title=Is Australia a Country or a Continent? - Country Digest|date=2016-09-07|work=Country Digest|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situated in the geographical region of [[Oceania]], it is the smallest of the seven traditional continents in the English conception.

The continent lies on a [[continental shelf]] overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses—the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Torres Strait]] between mainland Australia and New Guinea, and [[Bass Strait]] between mainland Australia and Tasmania. When [[sea level]]s were lower during the [[quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]], including the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] about 18,000 BC, they were connected by dry land. During the past 10,000 years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today's low-lying [[arid]] to [[semi-arid]] mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania.&lt;ref name="JohnsonPage12"&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = David Peter | year = 2004 | title = The Geology of Australia | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Port Melbourne, Victoria | id = | page = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Australia New Guinea continent.jpg|thumb|[[Mainland Australia]] showing the continental [[Sahul Shelf]] (light blue) extending to the islands of New Guinea in the north, the island of Timor in the northwest, and Tasmania in the south]]

Archaeological terminology for this region has changed repeatedly. Before the 1970s, the single Pleistocene landmass was called ''Australasia'', derived from the [[Latin]] ''australis'', meaning "southern", although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands like New Zealand that are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, the term ''Greater Australia'' was introduced for the Pleistocene continent.&lt;ref name=ballard&gt;{{cite conference |first=Chris |last=Ballard |title=Stimulating minds to fantasy? A critical etymology for Sahul |booktitle=Sahul in review: Pleistocene archaeology in Australia, New Guinea and island Melanesia |pages=19–20 |publisher=Australian National University | location= Canberra |year=1993 |isbn=0-7315-1540-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then at a 1975 conference and consequent publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=J. |author2=J.

In 1984 W. Filewood suggested the name ''Meganesia'', meaning "great island" or "great island-group", for both the Pleistocene continent and the present-day lands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=W. |last=Filewood |title=The Torres connection: Zoogeography of New Guinea |booktitle=Vertebrate zoogeography in Australasia |pages=1124–1125 |publisher=Hesperian Press | location=Carlisle, W.A. |year=1984 |isbn=0-85905-036-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this name has been widely accepted by biologists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite book |last=Flannery |first=Timothy Fridtjof |authorlink=Tim Flannery |title=The future eaters: An ecological history of the Australasian lands and people |year=1994 |publisher=Reed |location=Chatswood, NSW |isbn=0-7301-0422-2 |pages=42, 67 |chapter= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have used ''Meganesia'' with different meanings: travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] included New Zealand in his definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Theroux |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Theroux |title=The happy isles of Oceania: Paddling the Pacific |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-015976-2 |pages= |chapter= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have used it for Australia, New Zealand and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Wareham |first=Evelyn |date=September 2002 |title=From Explorers to Evangelists: Archivists, Recordkeeping, and Remembering in the Pacific Islands |journal=Archival Science |volume=2 |issue=3–4 |pages=187–207 |doi=10.1007/BF02435621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another biologist, [[Richard Dawkins]], coined the name ''Australinea'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The ancestor's tale: A pilgrimage to the dawn of evolution |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-00583-8 |page=224 |chapter= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australia-New Guinea'' has also been used.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Cite book

As the country of Australia is mostly on a single landmass, and comprises most of the continent, it is sometimes informally referred to as an island continent, surrounded by oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Löffler |first=Ernst |author2=A.J.

Geological forces such as [[tectonic uplift]] of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of [[Gondwana]]. Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore currently has no active volcanism.&lt;ref name="ag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/land-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes.htm |title=Land of earthquakes and volcanoes? |author=Kevin Mccue |accessdate=25 April 2010 |date=26 February 2010 |publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306150520/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/land-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes.htm |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continent primarily sits on the Indo-Australian Plate. Because of its central location on its tectonic plate Australia doesn't have any active volcanic regions, the only continent with this distinction.&lt;ref name="aeppp"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Environments: Place, Pattern and Process |last=Barrett |author2=Dent |year=1996 |publisher=Macmillan Education AU |isbn=0732931207 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9AUcU_35C9sC |accessdate=13 June 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529100215/https://books.google.com/books?id=9AUcU_35C9sC |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lands were joined with [[Antarctica]] as part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] until the plate began to drift north about 96 million years ago. For most of the time since then, Australia–New Guinea remained a continuous landmass. When the [[last glacial period]] ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed [[Bass Strait]], separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the [[Aru Islands]], and the Australian mainland.

A northern arc consisting of the [[New Guinea Highlands]], the [[Raja Ampat Islands]], and [[Halmahera]] was uplifted by the northward migration of Australia and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]]. The [[Outer Banda Arc]] was accreted along the northwestern edge the continent; it includes the islands of [[Timor]], [[Tanimbar]], and [[Seram Island|Seram]]. Papua New Guinea has [[List of volcanoes in Papua New Guinea|several volcanoes]], as it is situated along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

Among the fungi, the remarkable association between ''[[Cyttaria]]'' ''gunnii'' (one of the "golf-ball" fungi) and its associated trees in the genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' is evidence of that drift: the only other places where this association is known are New Zealand and southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;Korf, R.P. ''Cyttaria'' (Cyttariales): coevolution with ''Nothofagus'', and evolutionary relationship to the Boedijnpezizeae (Pezizales, Sarcoscyphaceae). pp. 77–87 in K.A. Pirozynski &amp; J. Walker [eds] Pacific Mycogeography: a Preliminary Approach. ''Australian Journal of Botany'' Supplementary Series No. 10, 172 pp. (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to [[aridity]] and fire which include [[sclerophyll|scleromorphy]] and [[serotiny]]. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families [[Proteaceae]] (''[[Banksia]]''), [[Myrtaceae]] (''[[Eucalyptus]]'' – gum trees), and [[Fabaceae]] (''[[Acacia]]'' – wattle). 

For about 40 million years Australia–New Guinea was almost completely isolated. During this time, the continent experienced numerous changes in climate, but the overall trend was towards greater aridity. When [[South America]] eventually separated from Antarctica, the development of the cold [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] changed weather patterns across the world. For Australia–New Guinea, it brought a marked intensification of the drying trend. The great inland seas and lakes dried out. Much of the long-established broad-leaf [[deciduous]] forest began to give way to the distinctive hard-leaved [[sclerophyllous]] plants that characterise the modern Australian landscape. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many [[tropical rainforest]] species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the [[conifer]]s ''[[Podocarpus]]'' and the rainforest emergents ''[[Araucaria]]'' and ''[[Agathis]]'', as well as [[tree fern]]s and several species of ''Eucalyptus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/samples/australiaburningsample.pdf |title=Australia Burning: Fire Ecology, Policy and Management Issues |publisher=CSIRO Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many species, the primary refuge was the relatively cool and well-watered [[Great Dividing Range]]. Even today, pockets of remnant vegetation remain in the cool uplands, some species not much changed from the Gondwanan forms of 60 or 90 million years ago. Eventually, the Australia–New Guinea tectonic plate collided with the [[Eurasian plate]] to the north. The collision caused the northern part of the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the [[Torres Strait]] that now separates the two main landmasses. The collision also pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from [[Southeast Asia]]'s rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia–New Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia–New Guinea and Asia.

As the continent drifted north from Antarctica, a unique [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]], [[Flora (plants)|flora]] and [[Fungi|mycobiota]] developed. [[Marsupial]]s and [[monotreme]]s also existed on other continents, but only in Australia–New Guinea did they out-compete the [[Placentalia|placental]] [[mammals]] and come to dominate. New Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, [[rodent]]s and [[bat]]s; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has a rich diversity of [[coral]] life and 1,200 species of [[fish]] have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world’s known total. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic.[[Aves|Bird]] life also flourished — in particular, the [[songbird]]s (order [[Passerine|Passeriformes]], suborder Passeri) are thought to have evolved 50 million years ago in the part of [[Gondwana]] that later became [[Australia]], New Zealand, [[New Guinea]], and [[Antarctica]], before radiating into a great number of different forms and then spreading around the globe.&lt;ref name=Low&gt;{{Citation

Animal groups such as [[Macropodidae|macropods]], [[monotremes]], and [[Cassowary|cassowaries]] are endemic to Australia. There were three main reasons for the enormous diversity that developed in animal, fungal and plant life.

* While much of the rest of the world underwent significant cooling and thus loss of species diversity, Australia–New Guinea was drifting north at such a pace that the overall global cooling effect was roughly equalled by its gradual movement toward the [[equator]]. [[Temperature]]s in Australia–New Guinea, in other words, remained reasonably constant for a very long time, and a vast number of different animal, fungal and plant species were able to evolve to fit particular [[ecological niche]]s.
* Because the continent was more isolated than any other, very few outside species arrived to colonise, and unique native forms developed unimpeded.
* Finally, despite the fact that the continent was already very old and thus relatively infertile, there are dispersed areas of high fertility. Where other continents had [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity and/or massive [[Glacier|glaciation]] events to turn over fresh, unleached [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s rich in [[mineral]]s, the rocks and [[soil]]s of Australia–New Guinea were left largely untouched except by gradual [[erosion]] and deep [[weathering]]. In general, fertile soils produce a profusion of life, and a relatively large number of species/level of biodiversity. This is because where [[nutrient]]s are plentiful, competition is largely a matter of outcompeting rival species, leaving great scope for innovative [[co-evolution]] as is witnessed in tropical, fertile ecosystems. In contrast, infertile soils tend to induce competition on an abiotic basis meaning individuals all face constant environmental pressures, leaving less scope for divergent evolution, a process instrumental in creating new species.

Although New Guinea is the most northerly part of the continent, and could be expected to be the most [[tropical climate|tropical]] in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia–New Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are severely threatened by [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures.

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Australia}}
In New Guinea, the climate is mostly [[monsoonal]] (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October), and [[tropical rainforest climate|tropical rainforest]] with slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80 °F (27 °C) year round. But the higher altitudes, such as [[Mendi]], are constantly around 70 °F (21 °C) with cool lows nearing 52 °F (11 °C), with abundant rainfall and high humidity. The [[New Guinea Highlands]] are one of the few regions close to the [[equator]] that experience [[snowfall]], which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland. Some areas in the island experience an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly {{convert|4500|mm}} of rainfall annually.

The Australian landmass's climate is mostly [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with the southern coastal corners having a [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, such as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[humid subtropical]] climate in the east coast and [[Mediterranean climate]] in the west. The northern parts of the country have a [[tropical climate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|title=BOM - Climate of Australia|first=National Climate|last=Centre|website=pandora.nla.gov.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclim.html|archivedate=2009-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Snow]] falls frequently on the [[Great Dividing Range|highlands]] near the east coast, in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]] and in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] came into being when the [[Constitution of Australia|Federal Constitution]] was proclaimed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]], on 1 January 1901. From that point a system of [[federalism in Australia]] came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. With the encouragement of Queensland, in 1884, a [[British protectorate]] had been proclaimed over the southern coast of New Guinea and its adjacent islands. [[British New Guinea]], was annexed outright in 1888. The possession was placed under the authority of the newly federated Commonwealth of Australia in 1902 and with passage of the Papua Act of 1905, British New Guinea became the Australian [[Territory of Papua]], with formal Australian administration beginning in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2797.htm |title=Papua New Guinea |publisher=State.gov |date=8 October 2010 |accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration brought large numbers of southern and central Europeans to Australia for the first time.

Papua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of their export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of country's development led foreign countries to take over few sites and continued foreign demand for PNG's resources and as a result, the United States constructed an oil company and began to export in 2004 and this was the largest project in PNG's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pp.html|title=The World Factbook|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apecpng2018.org/|title=APECPNG2018.ORG|website=www.apecpng2018.org|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papua New Guinea is classified as a [[Developing country|developing economy]] by the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2014&amp;ey=2014&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=16&amp;pr1.y=7&amp;c=512%2C668%2C914%2C672%2C612%2C946%2C614%2C137%2C311%2C962%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C193%2C548%2C122%2C556%2C912%2C678%2C313%2C181%2C419%2C867%2C513%2C682%2C316%2C684%2C913%2C273%2C124%2C868%2C339%2C921%2C638%2C948%2C514%2C943%2C218%2C686%2C963%2C688%2C616%2C518%2C223%2C728%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C522%2C692%2C622%2C694%2C156%2C142%2C624%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C453%2C960%2C968%2C423%2C922%2C935%2C714%2C128%2C862%2C611%2C135%2C321%2C716%2C243%2C456%2C248%2C722%2C469%2C942%2C253%2C718%2C642%2C724%2C643%2C576%2C939%2C936%2C644%2C961%2C819%2C813%2C172%2C199%2C132%2C733%2C646%2C184%2C648%2C524%2C915%2C361%2C134%2C362%2C652%2C364%2C174%2C732%2C328%2C366%2C258%2C734%2C656%2C144%2C654%2C146%2C336%2C463%2C263%2C528%2C268%2C923%2C532%2C738%2C944%2C578%2C176%2C537%2C534%2C742%2C536%2C866%2C429%2C369%2C433%2C744%2C178%2C186%2C436%2C925%2C136%2C869%2C343%2C746%2C158%2C926%2C439%2C466%2C916%2C112%2C664%2C111%2C826%2C298%2C542%2C927%2C967%2C846%2C443%2C299%2C917%2C582%2C544%2C474%2C941%2C754%2C446%2C698%2C666&amp;s=PPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a= World Economic Outlook Database, October 2015], [http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28 International Monetary Fund].

Papua New Guinea is a [[Commonwealth realm]]. As such, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is its sovereign and head of state. The constitutional convention, which prepared the draft constitution, and Australia, the outgoing metropolitan power, had thought that Papua New Guinea would not remain a monarchy. The founders, however, considered that imperial honours had a cachet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Sarah |title=Elizabeth: A Biography of Britain's Queen |year=1997 |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=1-57322-600-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monarch is represented by the [[Governor-General of Papua New Guinea]], currently [[Bob Dadae]]. Papua New Guinea (and the [[Solomon Islands]]) are unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature, rather than chosen by the executive branch.

Since 1788, the primary influence behind Australian culture has been [[Anglo-Celtic]] [[Western culture]], with some [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jupp|Jupp]], pp. 796–802.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Teo|Teo and White]], pp. 118–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The divergence and evolution that has occurred in the ensuing centuries has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture.&lt;ref name="Davison pp98–9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Davison, Hirst and Macintyre||pages=98–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Teo|Teo and White]], pp. 125–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-20th century, [[Culture of the United States|American popular culture]] has strongly influenced Australia, particularly through television and cinema.&lt;ref name=tw&gt;[[#Teo|Teo and White]], pp. 121–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultural influences come from neighbouring Asian countries, and through large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking nations.&lt;ref name=tw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jupp|Jupp]], pp. 808–12, 74–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Museum]] in Sydney and the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne are the oldest and [[List of largest art museums|largest]] [[museum]]s in the continent, as well as in [[Oceania]].&lt;ref&gt;Australian Museum, ''A Short History of the Australian Museum'', http://australianmuseum.net.au/A-short-history-of-the-Australian-Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VHR"&gt;National Gallery of Victoria - Victorian Heritage Register&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney's [[Sydney New Year's Eve|New Year's Eve]] celebrations are the largest in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaur |first=Jaskiran |date=2013 |url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/531947/20131227/party-new-year-s-eve-australia-sydney.htm |title=Where to party in Australia on New Year's Eve |publisher=International Business Times |accessdate=27 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708231528/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/531947/20131227/party-new-year-s-eve-australia-sydney.htm |archivedate=8 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that more than 7000 different cultural groups exist in Papua New Guinea, and most groups have their own language. Because of this diversity, in which they take pride, many different styles of cultural expression have emerged; each group has created its own expressive forms in [[art]], [[performance art]], [[weapon]]ry, [[costume]]s and [[architecture]]. Papua New Guinea is one of the few cultures in Oceania to practice the tradition of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Papua New Guinea – culture |work=Datec Pty Ltd |url=http://www.datec.com.au/png/culture.htm |accessdate=16 December 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990210114159/http://www.datec.com.au/png/culture.htm |archivedate=10 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Papua New Guinea is world-famous for carved wooden [[sculpture]]: masks, canoes, story-boards.

Australia has a tradition of Aboriginal art which is thousands of years old, the best known forms being rock art and [[bark painting]]. Evidence of [[Aboriginal art]] in Australia can be traced back at least 30,000 years.&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/art/index.htm|title=Australian Indigenous art|work=Australian Culture and Recreation Portal|publisher=Australia Government|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=26 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416144209/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/art/index.htm|archivedate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of ancient Aboriginal rock artworks can be found throughout the continent – notably in national parks such as those of the [[UNESCO]] listed sites at [[Uluru]] and [[Kakadu National Park]] in the Northern Territory, but also within [[Sydney rock engravings|protected parks in urban areas]] such as at [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://parksaustralia.gov.au/kakadu/people/rock-art.html|title=Kakadu: Rock art|work=parksaustralia.gov.au|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/people-place/rock-art.html|title=Uluru-Kata Tjuta: Rock art|publisher=parksaustralia.gov.au|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal culture includes a number of practices and ceremonies centered on a belief in the [[Dreamtime]].

'''Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission''' is a scientific research organization and regulatory body of [[Bangladesh]]. Its main objective is to promote use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rca.iaea.org/BGD/BAEC%20Latest%20WelCome%20Page%20.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was established on 27 February 1973.,&lt;ref&gt;[[Banglapedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; after the liberation of Bangladesh.

==Headquarters==
At first BAEC started its activities at a building for Jute Research Institute. Afterwards it was transferred to Dhaka University campus at 4 Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue. Before 1988 it was spelled 'Bangladesh Anobik Shakti Kamishon' (Literary Meaning: Bangladesh Molecular Energy Commission) in Bangla, from then it was renamed 'Bangladesh Paramanu Shakti Kamishon' (Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC)). In 2006, the headquarter (HQ) of BAEC was shifted to the newly built 'Poromanu Bhaban' building at Agargaon, Shere Bangla Nagar, Dhaka which is beside the only science museum in Bangladesh. All kinds of research and development activities of BAEC are conducted under three research wings: physical sciences, biological sciences and engineering.

The '''Bear Creek Wind Power Project''' is a [[wind farm]] located in [[Bear Creek Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Bear Creek Township]] near [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] in [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]], USA, with twelve [[Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica|Gamesa 2.0 MW wind turbine]]s that began commercial operation in March 2006.&lt;ref name=windpower&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind Farms in Pennsylvania|url=http://www.pawindenergynow.org/pa/farms.html|publisher=Pa Wind Working Group|accessdate=1 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100130175932/http://www.pawindenergynow.org/pa/farms.html| archivedate= 30 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind farm has a combined total [[Intermittent power source#Terminology|nameplate capacity]] of 24 MW, producing about 61.4 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually.&lt;ref name="windpower" /&gt; Bear Creek usually operates at roughly a 30% [[capacity factor]] until the winter months when winds are stronger and it runs near 70 percent capacity.&lt;ref name=bearcreek&gt;{{cite web|last=CHRISTMAN|first=AMANDA|title=Bear Creek offers example for municipalities considering wind farms  |url=http://standardspeaker.com/news/bear-creek-offers-example-for-municipalities-considering-wind-farms-1.512948#axzz1m7SMdLD2|work=The Standard Speaker|accessdate=3 March 2010|date=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind energy facility is located in the [[Pocono Mountains|Poconos]] region of [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]], less than 10 miles southeast of Wilkes-Barre near the village of [[Bear Creek Village, Pennsylvania|Bear Creek]]. Construction of the wind farm was made possible by commitments from [[PPL (utility)|PPL Energy Plus]] to purchase the output of the project and leading wind energy customers such as the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Pepco Holdings|PEPCO Energy Services]].&lt;ref name="windpower" /&gt;

The wind farm is visible while heading south on the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]'s [[Interstate 476|Northeast Extension]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11216">[[Image:Bone density scanner.jpg|right|thumb|A scanner used to measure bone density using [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]]]]
'''Bone density''', or '''bone mineral density''' ('''BMD'''), is the amount of [[bone mineral]] in [[bone tissue]]. The [[concept]] is of [[mass]] of mineral per [[volume]] of bone (relating to [[density]] in the [[physics]] sense), although [[medicine#Clinical practice|clinically]] it is measured by proxy according to [[optical density]] per square centimetre of [[bone]] surface upon [[medical imaging|imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Bone+Density}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone density measurement is used in clinical medicine as an indirect indicator of [[osteoporosis]] and [[fracture]] risk. It is measured by a procedure called [[densitometry]], often performed in the [[radiology]] or [[nuclear medicine]] departments of [[hospital]]s or [[clinic]]s. The measurement is painless and non-invasive and involves low [[radiation]] exposure. Measurements are most commonly made over the [[lumbar spine]] and over the upper part of the [[hip]].&lt;ref name="pmid18587077"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cole RE |title=Improving clinical decisions for women at risk of osteoporosis: dual-femur bone mineral density testing |journal=J Am Osteopath Assoc |volume=108 |issue=6 |pages=289–95 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18587077 |doi= |url=http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18587077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forearm may be scanned if the hip and lumbar spine are not accessible.

There is a [[statistics|statistical]] association between poor bone density and higher probability of fracture. Fractures of the legs and [[pelvis]] due to falls are a significant [[public health]] problem, especially in elderly women, leading to much medical cost, inability to live independently and even risk of death. Bone density measurements are used to screen people for osteoporosis risk and to identify those who might benefit from measures to improve bone strength.

==Testing==
Bone density tests are not necessary for people without risk factors for weak bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1 = American Academy of Family Physicians |author1-link = American Academy of Family Physicians |others = presented by [[ABIM Foundation]] |date =  |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page =  |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Acad_Fam_Phys.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120624075453/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Acad_Fam_Phys.pdf |archivedate = June 24, 2012 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whenyouneed"&gt;{{Citation | author1 = [[Consumer Reports]]| author2 = [[American Academy of Family Physicians]]| date = May 2012| title = Bone-density tests: When you need them – and when you don't| publisher = [[Consumer Reports]]| work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]]| page = | url = http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ChoosingWiselyBoneDensityAAFP.pdf| accessdate = August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unnecessary testing is more likely to result in superfluous treatment rather than discovery of a true problem.&lt;ref name="whenyouneed"/&gt;

Other considerations that are related to risk of low bone density and the need for a test include smoking habits, drinking habits, the long-term use of corticosteroid drugs, and a vitamin D deficiency.&lt;ref name="whenyouneed"/&gt;

===Conditions found===
For those people who do have bone density tests, two conditions which may be detected are [[osteoporosis]] and [[osteopenia]].&lt;ref name="whenyouneed"/&gt; The usual response to either of these indications is consultation with a physician.&lt;ref name="whenyouneed"/&gt;

==Terms==
Results are often reported in 3 terms:
#Measured areal density in g cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
#[[#Z-score|Z-score]], the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age, sex and ethnicity
#[[#T-score|T-score]], the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a healthy 30-year-old adult of the same sex and ethnicity as the patient

==Types of tests==
[[File:Blausen 0095 BoneDensitometryScan.png|thumb|Illustration of Bone Densitometry Scan]]
While there are many different types of BMD tests, all are non-invasive.  Most tests differ according to which bones are measured to determine the BMD result.

These tests include:
*[[DEXA|Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DXA or DEXA)
*[[Dual X-ray absorptiometry and laser|Dual X-ray Absorptiometry and Laser (DXL)]]
*[[QCT|Quantitative computed tomography]] (QCT)
*[[QUS|Quantitative ultrasound]] (QUS)
*[[Single photon absorptiometry]]  (SPA)
*[[Dual photon absorptiometry]]  (DPA)
*[[Digital X-ray radiogrammetry]] (DXR)
*[[SEXA|Single energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (SEXA)

DXA is currently the most widely used, but quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has been described as a more cost-effective approach to measure bone density.&lt;ref name="urlBone densitometry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/opbmd.html |title=Bone densitometry |work= |accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DXA test works by measuring a specific [[bone]] or bones, usually the spine, hip, and wrist.  The density of these bones is then compared with an average index based on age, sex, and size.  The resulting comparison is used to determine risk for fractures and the stage of osteoporosis (if any) in an individual.

Average bone mineral density = BMC / W [g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]
*BMC = bone mineral content = g/cm
*W = width at the scanned line

==Interpretation==
Results are generally scored by two measures, the [[T-score]] and the [[Z-score]]. Scores indicate the amount one's bone mineral density varies from the mean. Negative scores indicate lower bone density, and positive scores indicate higher.

===T-score===
The T-score is the relevant measure when screening for osteoporosis. It is the bone mineral density (BMD) at the site when compared to the '''young normal reference mean'''. It is a comparison of a patient's BMD to that of a healthy 30-year-old. The US standard is to use data for a 30-year-old of the same sex and ethnicity, but the WHO recommends using data for a 30-year-old white female for everyone.&lt;ref name="Univ Washington Bone Physics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.washington.edu/bonephys/opbmdtz.html |title=T and Z scores. |accessdate=2013-06-22 |last=Unknown|first=Unknown |date=2011-07-29 |publisher=University of Washington Bone Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Values for 30-year-olds are used in post-menopausal women and men over age 50 because they better predict risk of future fracture.&lt;ref name="Richmond"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=11559&amp;nbr=5990 |title=Osteoporosis and bone mineral density. |accessdate=2008-05-11 |last=Richmond |first=Bradford |date=2007-11-13 |publisher=American College of Radiology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917114051/http://guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?ss=15&amp;doc_id=11559&amp;nbr=5990 |archive-date=2008-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria of the [[World Health Organization]] are:&lt;ref name="WHOcriteria"&gt;{{cite web | author=WHO Scientific Group on the Prevention and Management of Osteoporosis (2000 : Geneva, Switzerland) |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_921.pdf |title=Prevention and management of osteoporosis : report of a WHO scientific group| year=2003 |accessdate=2007-05-31 |format=pdf |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Normal is a T-score of −1.0 or higher
* [[Osteopenia]] is defined as between −1.0 and −2.5
* [[Osteoporosis]] is defined as −2.5 or lower, meaning a bone density that is two and a half standard deviations below the mean of a 30-year-old man/woman.

|}

===Z-score===
The Z-score is the comparison to the '''age-matched normal''' and is usually used in cases of severe osteoporosis. This is the number of standard deviations a patient's BMD differs from the average BMD of their age, sex, and ethnicity. This value is used in premenopausal women, men under the age of 50, and in children.&lt;ref name="Richmond" /&gt; It is most useful when the score is less than 2 standard deviations below this normal. In this setting, it is helpful to scrutinize for coexisting illnesses or treatments that may contribute to osteoporosis such as glucocorticoid therapy, hyperparathyroidism, or alcoholism.

==Limitations==
Use of BMD has several limitations.
# Measurement can be affected by the size of the patient, the thickness of tissue overlying the bone, and other factors extraneous to the bones.
# Bone density is a proxy measurement for bone strength, which is the resistance to fracture and the truly significant characteristic. Although the two are usually related, there are some circumstances in which bone density is a poorer indicator of bone strength.
# Reference standards for some populations (e.g., children) are unavailable for many of the methods used.
# Crushed vertebrae can result in falsely high bone density, so they must be excluded from analysis.

The '''Canada–U.S. softwood lumber dispute''' is one of the largest and most enduring trade disputes between both nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/the-granddaddy-of-all-canadian-u-s-trade-disputes-is-about-to-rear-its-ugly-head-again |title=The granddaddy of all Canadian-U.S. trade disputes is about to rear its ugly head again &amp;#124; Financial Post |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict arose in 1982 and its effects are still seen today.  [[British Columbia]], the major [[Canada|Canadian]] exporter of [[softwood]] [[lumber]] to the [[United States]], was most affected, reporting losses of 9,494 direct and indirect jobs between 2004 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Overview of the Lumber Industry in Canada, 2004 to 2010|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-621-m/2011089/part-partie1-eng.htm|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart of the dispute is the claim that the Canadian lumber industry is unfairly [[subsidy|subsidized]] by federal and [[Canadian federalism|provincial governments]], as most timber in Canada is owned by the provincial governments. The prices charged to harvest the timber ([[stumpage]] fee) are set administratively, rather than through the competitive marketplace, the norm in the United States.  In the United States, softwood lumber lots are privately owned, and the owners form an effective [[lobbying in the United States|political lobby]].  The United States claims that the Canadian arrangement constitutes an unfair subsidy, and is thus subject to U.S. trade remedy laws, where foreign trade benefiting from subsidies can be subject to a [[countervailing duties|countervailing duty tariff]], to offset the subsidy and bring the price of the commodity back up to market rates.

The Canadian government and lumber industry dispute this assertion, based on a number of factors, including that Canadian timber is provided to such a wide range of industries, and that lack of specificity makes it ineligible to be considered a subsidy under U.S. law. Under U.S. trade remedy law, a countervailable subsidy must be specific to a particular industry. This requirement precludes imposition of countervailing duties on government programs, such as roads, that are meant to benefit a broad array of interests. Since 1982, there have been four major iterations of the dispute.

== Importance of lumber to Canada's economy ==
The softwood lumber industry is vital to the [[economy of Canada|Canadian economy]] and has employed thousands of people. The forest industry has contributed to direct jobs for about 232,700 individuals.&lt;ref name="Service"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/statsprofile/overview/ca|title=Statistical data {{!}} Forests {{!}} Natural Resources Canada|last=Service|first=Government of Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest|website=cfs.nrcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly, 289,000 people&lt;ref name="Service"/&gt; have been hired to work in other sectors that depend on Canada's forests. They include engineering, transportation, and construction. Such benefit from this industry can be seen in the nation's GDP, which added $21.2 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/pick-choisir?lang=eng&amp;p2=33&amp;id=3790031|title=Welcome to Statistics Canada|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last2=Canada|first2=Gouvernement du Canada, Statistique|website=www5.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; That accounted for around 1.3% of real GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/pick-choisir?lang=eng&amp;p2=33&amp;id=3790031|title=CANSIM - 379-0031 - Gross domestic product (GDP) at basic prices, by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www5.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has the biggest trade surplus in relation to forest products ($21.7 billion in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/industry/13311 |title=Overview &amp;#124; Natural Resources Canada |publisher=Nrcan.gc.ca |date=2014-12-31 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest market, the U.S. is heavily dependent on Canada's lumber. The needs of the US outweigh the domestic supply.  Canada has also been expanding rapidly into the Asian market, with China being the second-largest importer. The U.S. accounted for 69% of Canada's softwood lumber exports in 2015. This is an increased share of Canadian softwood lumber exports, which reached its lowest level in 2011, accounting for only 54%. China in that same year accounted for 21%.

==Softwood Lumber Agreement==
In April 2006, the United States and Canada announced that they had reached a tentative settlement to end the dispute. The Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA), which this became known as, went into full effect in October 2006. The conditions stated that the period for this agreement would last anywhere between seven and nine years. Both countries, in 2012, approved a two-year extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uslumbercoalition.org/general.cfm?page=4 |title=About the Softwood Lumber Agreement |publisher=Uslumbercoalition.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the preliminary terms, the United States would lift countervailing and anti-dumping duties provided lumber prices continue to stay above a certain range. Below the specified range, a mixed export tax and quota regime would be implemented on imports of Canadian lumber. On Canada's part, the nation agreed to enforce regulations, such as in the form of taxes on lumber exports headed to the U.S. The provincial governments of Canada, specifically, were encouraged to make changes to their pricing systems. Such changes would allow for a non-subsidizing system. As a part of the deal, more than $5&amp;nbsp;billion in duty deposits collected would be returned. The SLA establishes a dispute settlement mechanism based around the [[London Court of International Arbitration]] (LCIA), a nongovernmental institution. Either country may initiate dispute settlement of matters arising under the SLA or implementation thereof. Hearings are to be open to the public, as are pleadings and other documents.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;John R. Crook, ed., ''American Journal of International Law,'' Contemporary Practice of the United States Relating to International Law: UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARBITRATE A SOFTWOOD LUMBER DISPUTE IN THE LONDON COURT OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, 102 Am. J. Int'l L. 192 (January 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement states that hearings are to be held in either the United States or Canada (the venue is selected by the arbitration tribunal). The SLA also provides that decisions of an arbitration panel are binding on the two parties.&lt;ref name="international1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/softwood-bois_oeuvre/notices-avis/arbitration-arbitrage.aspx?lang=eng |title=Fact Sheet: Softwood Lumber Agreement Arbitration Process |publisher=International.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lumber I==
{{Unreferenced section|date= May 2014}}
The beginnings of the softwood lumber dispute, commonly referred to as Lumber I, were in 1982, when the U.S. lumber industry petitioned the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] (DoC) to impose a countervailing duty. Ultimately, the DoC found that Canada's stumpage system was not specific to any single industry and thus not countervailable. While the DoC made this claim, the [[United States International Trade Commission]] (USITC) believed that these Canadian imports did in fact hinder U.S. producers.&lt;ref name="uslumbercoalition1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uslumbercoalition.org/doc/dispute_history.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. - Canada Lumber Trade Dispute: A Brief History |date=July 2012 |publisher=Uslumbercoalition.org |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. lumber industry chose not to appeal.

==Lumber II==
{{Unreferenced section|date= May 2014}}
The second phase, Lumber II, began in 1986, when a U.S. lumber industry group, the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, petitioned the Department of Commerce.&lt;ref name="uslumbercoalition1"/&gt; The USITC once again arrived at the conclusion that Canada's exports unfairly impacted American producers. This time, the DoC did find Canadian forest programs to be countervailable and set a preliminary duty of 15%. Before the subsidy was imposed, the United States and Canada agreed to a [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] that created a phased tariff. One of the terms of the MOU was that Canada levy an export tax on lumber traveling to the United States. Provinces that were affected had the chance to reduce this tax, if they performed any action meant to counterbalance their subsidies. British Columbia had the tax removed in 1987 while Quebec had it partly lifted in 1988.&lt;ref name="uslumbercoalition1"/&gt;

==Lumber III==
{{Unreferenced section|date= May 2014}}
Lumber III started in 1991 when Canada informed the United States it was withdrawing from the Memorandum of Understanding. In response, the Department of Commerce initiated a countervailing duty investigation, resulting in the DoC imposing countervailing duties.

This time, the Department of Commerce's determination was reviewed by a binational panel organized under the [[Canada–US Free Trade Agreement|Canada–U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] (CUSFTA), the predecessor to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. Prior to the signing of NAFTA, the DoC decision would have been reviewed by the [[United States Court of International Trade]], but under CUSFTA, Canada had the option to have it reviewed by a binational panel, and they selected that option. The panel of three Canadians and two Americans found that the DoC's determination could not be supported by substantial evidence; which was a controversial decision, because the vote was along national lines, and the majority decision was based on the concept that U.S. law required the Department of Commerce to not only establish the existence of a subsidy, but also prove that the subsidy benefited the Canadian lumber industry. The U.S. Congress subsequently amended the law to explicitly state there was no "effects test". Additionally, the United States claimed that two of the Canadian panelists had conflicts of interests, and brought it before an extraordinary challenge committee. Again, this committee split along national lines. [[Malcolm Richard Wilkey]], a retired judge with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] judge, wrote a dissent claiming that the panelists had conflicts of interest, and that its decision violated many of the rules of an appellate review of agency decision-making.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} One of the Canadian judges found that while the panelists were remiss in their disclosure obligations, the alleged conflicts were not severe enough to warrant their recusal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 1996, the United States and Canada reached a five-year trade agreement, ''The Softwood Lumber Agreement'', officially ending Lumber III. Under its terms, Canadian lumber exports to the United States were limited to 14.7 billion [[board feet]] (34.7 million cubic meters) per year. However, when the agreement expired on April 2, 2001, the two countries were unable to reach consensus on a replacement agreement.

==Lumber IV==
[[File:Wood-framed house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Many American homes are built of Canadian softwood lumber.]]

Three days after the Softwood Lumber Agreements expired, the U.S. lumber industry petitioned the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ita.doc.gov/media/FactSheet/lumber0040201.html |title=Office of Public Affairs |publisher=Ita.doc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the U.S. industry for the first time brought an anti-[[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] claim, arguing Canadian lumber companies were also engaged in unfair price discrimination. On April 25, 2002, U.S. DoC announced it had determined [[subsidy]] and anti-dumping rates, of 18.79% and an 8.43% respectively, to give a combined rate of 27.22%, although specific companies were charged varying rates. By February 26, 2003, 15,000 workers had been laid off, primarily in British Columbia, as a result of the duties imposed by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2003/02/25/softwood_lumber030225.html |title=Canada, U.S. softwood talks break down - Canada - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2003-02-26 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 27, the [[World Trade Organization]] issued a non-binding ruling in Canada's favor with regard to U.S. anti-dumping duties. The decision was appealed to a legally binding NAFTA panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.about.com/cs/agriculture/a/softwood_lumber_2.htm |title=The Softwood Lumber Dispute |publisher=Economics.about.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 13, the panel ruled that while the Canadian lumber industry could be considered subsidized, the DoC had improperly calculated duties based on U.S. stumpage prices: there was no "world market price" for timber, as the DoC had asserted, and it was therefore improper for DoC to calculate duties based on U.S. timber prices rather than Canadian market conditions.&lt;ref name=Foster2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Abby C|title=Summary and Explanation of the U.S.-Canada Lumber Dispute|journal=Summary for Penn State Dickinson School of Law|date=2008|url=https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/_file/aglaw/Lumber_Trade.pdf|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhang2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhang|first1=Daowei|title=The Softwood Lumber War: "Politics, Economics, and the Long U.S.-Canadian Trade Dispute|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136524096|pages=138–140}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It accordingly ordered DoC to reassess its method of calculating duties.

Two weeks later, a WTO panel similarly concluded that the U.S. had imposed improperly high duties on Canadian lumber. The panel agreed with the DoC's contention that provincial stumpage fees did provide a "financial benefit" to Canadian producers, but ruled that this benefit did not rise to the level that would constitute a subsidy, and could not justify the U.S. duties.&lt;ref name=Foster2008/&gt;

On January 19, 2004, the WTO [[Appellate Body]] issued a final ruling with respect to the countervailing duty determination largely in Canada's favor (WTO Dispute 257). On August 11 of that same year, the Appellate Body issued a final ruling with respect to U.S. anti-dumping duties (WTO Dispute 264).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds264_e.htm |title=dispute settlement - the disputes - DS264 |publisher=WTO.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, because of an adverse WTO decision, the USITC reopened the administrative record, pursuant to a special provision in U.S. law, and issued a new affirmative threat of injury determination in December 2004. This new determination allowed the countervailing and anti-dumping duty tariffs to remain in place.

Between June 7, 2004, and October 5, 2005, DoC submitted five revised estimates of justifiable duties to the NAFTA panel, each successively lower than the last, the last being 1.21%, but each time the NAFTA panel found errors with each one and ordered it to recalculate.&lt;ref name=Zhang2010/&gt;

On April 15, 2005, the Canadian [[Minister of International Trade (Canada)|Minister of Trade]], [[Jim Peterson]], announced that the federal government would provide Canadian softwood lumber associations with $20 million in compensation for their legal expenses stemming from the dispute with the United States. That same year, another NAFTA Chapter 19 panel reviewed a determination made by the USITC that the U.S. lumber industry was under a threat of injury due to Canadian imports. Since the United States ceded jurisdiction to the [[World Trade Organization]], it was necessary for the U.S. government to establish that a domestic industry was suffering injury, or faced a threat of injury, before countervailing duties can be imposed. The NAFTA panel found the USITC's determination invalid. In addition, the panel made the controversial decision to deny the USITC to reopen the administrative record, ordering the USITC to issue a negative determination based on the existing record. Unlike the panel during the Lumber III stage, this panel's decision was unanimous. However, the U.S. government challenged its decision before an extraordinary challenge committee, which, on August 10, 2005, issued a unanimous decision against the United States, finding that the NAFTA panel's determination was not sufficiently invalid to require ''vacatur'' or remand, under the standards of NAFTA.

On August 15, 2005, the United States said it would not abide by the NAFTA decision, because the Section 129 determination superseded the decision which was reviewed by the NAFTA panel. Two weeks later, on August 30, the WTO, which had previously ruled against the ITC, this time upheld their new Section 129 "threat of injury" ruling. In September 2005, a U.S. lumber industry associate filed suit in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], challenging the constitutionality of the NAFTA Chapter 19 dispute settlement system. On November 24, 2005, the U.S. Commerce Department announced it would comply with a separate NAFTA panel's order to cut a 16 percent duty on Canadian softwood lumber imports for now. The following month, the DoC announced recalculated countervailing and anti-dumping duties on softwood, totaling 10.8 percent.

In March 2006, a NAFTA panel ruled in Canada's favor, finding that the subsidy to the Canadian lumber industry was [[de minimis]], i.e., a subsidy of less than one percent. Under U.S. trade remedy law, countervailing duty tariffs are not imposed for de minimis subsidies. A tentative deal was reached in July 2006, in which Canada got $4 billion of the $5.3 billion it lost because of the penalties with no additional tariffs to be imposed. After initial opposition from several large Canadian lumber concerns, the Harper government, without specifying how many companies endorsed it, was confident that there would be enough support to culminate the deal. In August 2006, Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] brought the new deal to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] for discussion and a possible [[confidence vote]]. If the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] had voted against the deal, it would have automatically forced a general election and annulled the deal. The Conservatives were in favor of the deal, while the [[New Democratic Party]] and the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] were against, leaving the [[Bloc Québécois]] as the deciding party.

On September 7, Bloc Québécois Leader [[Gilles Duceppe]] endorsed the softwood lumber deal, effectively neutralizing any chance of an election coming out of a non-confidence vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060908/liberals_softwood_deal_060908/20060908?hub=Canada |title=CTV News &amp;#124; Top Stories - Breaking News - Top News Headlines |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527171026/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060908/liberals_softwood_deal_060908/20060908?hub=Canada |archivedate=2007-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, Canadian International Trade Minister [[David Emerson]], along with U.S. counterpart [[Susan Schwab]], officially signed the deal in Ottawa. Despite supporters' claims that it was the best deal possible, [[Elliott Feldman]], an international and economic law specialist from the firm [[Baker &amp; Hostetler]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a former director of the [[Canadian–American Business Council]], criticized the deal as "one-sided" and a "bad deal for Canada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060911/softwood_deal_060912/20060912?hub=TopStories |title=CTV News &amp;#124; Top Stories - Breaking News - Top News Headlines |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616024930/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060911/softwood_deal_060912/20060912?hub=TopStories |archivedate=2008-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 19, 2006, the deal passed its [[first reading]] in the Canadian House of Commons with a 172–116 majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060919/softwood_vote_060919/20060919/ |title=CTV News &amp;#124; Top Stories - Breaking News - Top News Headlines |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616024935/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060919/softwood_vote_060919/20060919/ |archivedate=2008-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, the [[Canadian Press]] reported that Canada did not meet an October 1 deadline imposed by itself to implement the agreement. Withdrawal of some of the 30 issues regarding the deal was the main reason for the delay on complying to the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060927/softwood_deadline_060927/20060927?hub=Canada |title=CTV News &amp;#124; Top Stories - Breaking News - Top News Headlines |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2014-05-08 |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527165836/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060927/softwood_deadline_060927/20060927?hub=Canada |archivedate=2007-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2007, the United States requested formal consultations with Canada to resolve concerns regarding Canada's lack of implementation of the export measures.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2008/January/Statement_from_USTR_Spokesman_Sean_Spicer_on_Softwood_Lumber_Agreement_Between_Canada_United_States.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114203830/http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2008/January/Statement_from_USTR_Spokesman_Sean_Spicer_on_Softwood_Lumber_Agreement_Between_Canada_United_States.html |date=January 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, on April 19, formal consultations took place between the two governments&lt;ref name="international1"/&gt; On August 7, the United States, pursuant to a settlement mechanism established in the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA), initiated arbitration in the [[London Court of International Arbitration]] (LCIA, a private body).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2007/August/United_States_to_Request_Arbitration_Challenging_Canadas_Implementation_of_the_2006_Softwood_Lumber_Agreement.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506015345/http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2007/August/United_States_to_Request_Arbitration_Challenging_Canadas_Implementation_of_the_2006_Softwood_Lumber_Agreement.html |date=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade_Agreements/Monitoring_Enforcement/2006_Softwood_Lumber_Agreement/asset_upload_file465_13242.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official request for arbitration took place on August 13.&lt;ref name="international1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Canada responded to this request for arbitration on September 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/assets/pdfs/softwood/Response-Canada.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322125419/http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/assets/pdfs/softwood/Response-Canada.pdf |date=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, on January 18, the U.S. government filed a second arbitration request, this one focused on the provincial implementation programs of Ontario and Québec.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/assets/pdfs/softwood/jan18-ArbitrationRequest.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322125521/http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/assets/pdfs/softwood/jan18-ArbitrationRequest.pdf |date=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada responded on February 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/assets/pdfs/softwood/CanadaResponsetoRequestforArbitration.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322125551/http://www.international.gc.ca/controls-controles/assets/pdfs/softwood/CanadaResponsetoRequestforArbitration.pdf |date=March 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, the LCIA ruled (in the first arbitration) that Canada was in violation of the 2006 SLA in its eastern provinces, but not in its western provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2008/March/asset_upload_file97_14550.pdf ]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506043400/http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2008/March/asset_upload_file97_14550.pdf |date=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel had been made up of a Belgian arbitrator nominated by Canada, a British arbitrator named by the United States, and a panel president from Germany.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; On February 26, 2009, the LCIA announced its ruling in the second arbitration case: Canada was in breach of the softwood lumber agreement as a result of its failure to properly calculate quotas from January to June in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/02/26/softwood-lumber.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302131413/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/02/26/softwood-lumber.html |date=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE51P86G20090227 |title=U.S. claims victory in lumber case against Canada &amp;#124; Top News &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Ca.reuters.com |date=2009-02-26 |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalarbitrationreview.com/news/article/5142/canada-loses-softwood-lumber-arbitration/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711101402/http://www.globalarbitrationreview.com/news/article/5142/canada-loses-softwood-lumber-arbitration/ |date=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arbitration body ordered that [[sawmill]]s in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan pay an additional ten percent export charge (up to $68.26 million). The tribunal imposed a 30-day deadline to rectify the breach.

==Looking ahead==
{{Update|date=February 2016}}&lt;!-- What happened after the expiration date? --&gt;
The Softwood Lumber Agreement expired on October 12, 2015. Canadian producers of softwood lumber now have unfettered access to the US softwood lumber market.

There are several impediments that have kept Canada and the US from negotiating a new agreement to replace the SLA. One key factor is that [[Canadian federal election, 2015|Canada held a federal election campaign through the late summer and fall of 2015]], and any decisions of considerable magnitude had to wait until after the election.  Given the acrimonious history of the US–Canada lumber trade prior to the SLA, the negotiation process will likely be lengthy.

Some{{Who|date=June 2016}} in Western Canada have expressed a desire to renew the SLA as it currently stands, while other are demanding revisions. Some officials{{Who|date=June 2016}} in Quebec believe that the province has made the necessary changes to their forestry practices to make them exempt from any future agreement, much the same as the Maritime provinces.  And some producers in Saskatchewan have expressed a desire to switch to the Option A system used in BC and Alberta, which assesses a larger tax but has no quota restrictions.

Canadian ownership of US sawmills continues to climb with the count now{{When|date=June 2016}} reaching 40 mills, up from just two a decade earlier.  West Fraser now owns more sawmills in the US South (16) than in Canada (13), Canfor Corp owns 11 sawmills in the South, one less than its Canadian total.  Interfor owns 13 sawmills in the US – nine in the South and four in the Northwest. It owns five sawmills in Canada.  The growing trend of Canadian ownership of US mills is driven by the potential for a lumber trade conflict, by timber availability and lower labour costs in the US.  Amid the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation in Western Canada, these firms' ability to grow is severely diminished without looking outside of Canada.

Major industry organizations in the United States, on the other hand, do not want to renew the contract.  Executive director of the U.S. Lumber Coalition Zoltan Van Heyningen has expressed his disapproval for the ongoing format of the agreement. One of the reasons for this is changing timber costs, which the U.S. believes has not been incorporated in B.C. lumber costs.  The US Lumber Coalition is emphatic that, should negotiations fail, its legal standing to petition the US Commerce Department to file a new case is secure.  To do so, US trade law requires support from at least 25% of the US industry and at least 50% of those in the US industry expressing a view.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Van Heyningen said that unless Canadian companies can show that anti-dumping or countervailing duties would harm their US production, they would be excluded from the calculation of the 50% support level - both from the numerator and the denominator - "thereby increasing the overall level of support in the rest of the US industry."{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In early March 2016, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Justin Trudeau]] and U.S. President Obama instructed their respective cabinet members responsible for international trade to explore all options for resolving the trade dispute.&lt;ref name="Tasker2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tasker|first1=John Paul|title=Chrystia Freeland heralds 'real breakthrough' on softwood lumber negotiations|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chrystia-freeland-softwood-lumber-1.3488105|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=CBC|date=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's international trade minister, [[Chrystia Freeland]], said that "what we have committed to is to make significant, meaningful progress towards a deal—to have the structure, the key elements there a 100 days from now".&lt;ref name="Tasker2016"/&gt;

On 12 October 2016, a one-year moratorium on trade actions since the expiration of the deal ended. As of November 2016, Freeland had formally met with [[Office of the United States Trade Representative|U.S. Trade Representative]] [[Michael Froman]] twelve times in the past year. During these talks, Canada sent ten proposals and papers to the United States, which sent four to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/softwood-lumber-canada-united-states-negotiations-1.3853770|title=Trump leak on softwood lumber confuses tricky file that costs $30M just to manage|last=McGregor|first=Janyce|date=November 17, 2016|work=|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|access-date=November 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, [[CNN]] obtained a leaked memo from the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|Donald Trump transition team]] showing that Trump was being advised to include the softwood lumber dispute during any renegotiations of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and to get more favourable terms for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadian-businesses-seek-clarity-on-trumps-trade-policies/article32869000/|title=Trump team flags Canadian livestock and lumber as targets in NAFTA reset|last=Chase|first=Steven|date=November 16, 2016|work=|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=November 22, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2017, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his agency will impose new anti-subsidy tariffs averaging 20 percent on Canadian softwood lumber imports, a move that escalates a long-running trade dispute between the two countries. A Commerce Department fact sheet on the pending announcement seen by Reuters shows that West Fraser Mills will pay the highest duties at 24.12 percent, followed by Canfor Corp at 20.26 percent. Resolute FP Canada Ltd will pay a 12.82 percent duty, while Tolko Marketing and Sales and Tolko Industries will pay a 19.50 percent duty and J. D. Irving Ltd, will pay 3.02 percent. All other Canadian producers face a 19.88 percent duty, according to the document.

On April 25, 2017, the Trump administration announced plans to impose duties of up to 24% on most Canadian lumber, charging that lumber companies are subsidized by the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-canadian-lumber-20170425-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The duties are on the five firms: West Fraser Mills, Tolko Marketing and Sales, J. D. Irving, Canfor Corporation, and Resolute FP Canada. West Fraser Mills will pay the highest duty of 24%.&lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/24/investing/canada-lumber-tariff-trump/index.html?iid=EL&lt;/ref&gt;

The preliminary determination directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require cash deposits for the duties on all new imports as well as softwood products imported over the past 90 days. To remain in effect, however, the duties need to be finalized by Commerce and then confirmed by the U.S. International Trade Commission after an investigation that includes testimony from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/24/us-to-impose-20-pct-duties-on-canadian-softwood-lumber-ross.html|title=US to impose 20% tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber: Ross|last=CNBC|date=2017-04-24|website=CNBC|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Canadian federal government indicated that it was exploring the possibility of banning United States coal from being exported through Canadian ports and imposing a retaliatory tariff on lumber exports from [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Panetta|first1=Alexander|title=Canada weighing multiple trade actions against U.S. over softwood lumber dispute|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-weighs-tarrifs-on-america-1.4102052|accessdate=May 5, 2017|work=CBC News|agency=The Canadian Press|date=May 5, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2017, the U.S. International Trade Commission decided to levy heavy [[countervailing]] and anti-dumping duties on lumber imports, citing that the U.S. industry has been harmed  by unfair practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/finance/363807-us-locks-in-duties-on-canadas-softwood-lumber-industry|title=US locks in duties on Canada's softwood lumber industry|last=Needham|first=Vicki|date=2017-12-07|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was unanimous for the four-member trade panel, which ruled on the petition filed by the U.S. Lumber Coalition.

'''Cobalt-chrome''' or '''cobalt-chromium''' ('''CoCr''') is a [[metal]] [[alloy]] of [[cobalt]] and [[chromium]]. Cobalt-chrome has a very high [[specific strength]] and is commonly used in [[gas turbine]]s, [[dental implant]]s, and [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic implant]]s.&lt;ref name="arcam"&gt;[http://www.arcam.com/CommonResources/Files/www.arcam.com/Documents/EBM%20Materials/Arcam-ASTM-F75-Cobalt-Chrome.pdf ARCAM ASTM F75 CoCr Alloy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707155747/http://www.arcam.com/CommonResources/Files/www.arcam.com/Documents/EBM%20Materials/Arcam-ASTM-F75-Cobalt-Chrome.pdf |date=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Co-Cr alloy was first discovered by [[Elwood Haynes]] in the early 1900s by fusing cobalt and chromium. The alloy was first discovered with many other elements such as tungsten and molybdenum in it. Haynes reported his alloy was capable of resisting oxidation and corrosive fumes and exhibited no visible sign of tarnish even when subjecting the alloy to boiling nitric acid.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, E. Metal alloy. US patent no. 873745; 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the name [[Stellite]]™, Co-Cr alloy has been used in various fields where high wear-resistance was needed including aerospace industry,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ratner, B. D.; Hoffman, A. S.; Schoen, F. J.; Lemons, J. E. ''Biomaterial Science, ''2nd ed.; Academic Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; cutlery, bearings, blades, etc. 

Co-Cr alloy started receiving more attention as its biomedical application was found. In the 20th century, the alloy was first used in medical tool manufacturing,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hyslop, D. J. S.; Abdelkader, A. M.; Cox, A.; Fray, D. J. Electrochemical Synthesis of a Biomedically Important Co-Cr Alloy. ''Acta Materialia''. '''2010, '''''58, ''3124-3130.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1960, the first Co-Cr prosthetic heart valve was implanted, which happened to last over 30 years showing its high wear-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Tarzia, V.; Bottio, T.; Testolin, L.; Gerosa, G. Extended (31 years) durability of a Starr-Edwards Prothesis in Mitral Positioin. ''Interactive CardioVasc Thorac Surg. '''''2007, '''''6, ''570-571. ''' '''&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, due to excellent resistant properties, [[biocompatibility]], high melting points, and incredible strength at high temperatures, Co-Cr alloy is used for the manufacture of many artificial joints including hips and knees, dental partial bridge work, gas turbines, and many others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Synthesis ==
The common Co-Cr alloy production requires the [[Cobalt extraction techniques|extraction of cobalt]] and [[chromium]] from cobalt oxide and [[chromium oxide]] ores. Both of the ores need to go through reduction process to obtain pure metals. Chromium usually goes through [[Aluminothermic reaction|aluminothermic reduction technique]], and pure cobalt can be achieved through many different ways depending on the characteristics of the specific ore. Pure metals are then fused together under vacuum either  by [[electric arc]] or by [[Vacuum induction melting|induction melting]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the chemical reactivity of metals at high temperature, the process requires vacuum conditions or inert atmosphere to prevent oxygen uptake by the metal. ASTM F75, a Co-Cr-Mo alloy, is produced in an inert argon atmosphere by ejecting molten metals through a small nozzle that is immediately cooled to produce a fine powder of the alloy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, synthesis of Co-Cr alloy through the method mentioned above is very expensive and difficult. Recently, in 2010, scientists at the University of Cambridge have produced the alloy through a novel electrochemical, solid-state reduction technique known as the [[FFC Cambridge Process]] which involves the reduction of an oxide precursor cathode in a molten chloride electrolyte.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Properties ==
Co-Cr alloys show high resistance to corrosion due to the spontaneous formation of a protective passive film composed of mostly [[Chromium(III) oxide|Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and minor amounts of cobalt and other metal oxides on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Bettini, E.; Leygraf, C.; Pan, J.

'''''8, ''11791-11804.&lt;/ref&gt; As its wide application in biomedical industry indicates, Co-Cr alloys are well known for their biocompatibility. [[Biocompatibility]] also depends on the film and how this oxidized surface interacts with physiological environment.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, J.; Ciacchi, L. C. Origins of the Selective Cr Oxidation in CoCr Alloy Surfaces. ''J. Pjus. Chem. Lett. '''''2010, '''''1, ''2343-2348.&lt;/ref&gt; Good mechanical properties that are similar to [[stainless steel]] are a result of a multiphase structure and precipitation of carbides, which increase the hardness of Co-Cr alloys tremendously.

== Common types ==
There are several Co-Cr alloys that are commonly produced and used in various fields. F75 and F799 are Co-Cr-Mo alloys with very similar composition yet slightly different production processes, F90 is a [[Alacrite|Co-Cr-W-Ni alloy]], and F562 is a Co-Ni-Cr-Mo-Ti alloy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Structure ==
Depending on the percent composition of cobalt or chromium and the temperature, Co-Cr alloys show different structures. The σ phase, where the alloy contains approximately 60-75% cobalt, tends to be brittle and subject to a [[fracture]]. FCC crystal structure is found in the γ phase, and the γ phase shows improved strength and ductility compared to the σ phase. FCC crystal structure is commonly found in cobalt rich alloys, while chromium rich alloys tend to have BCC crystal structure. The γ phase Co-Cr alloy can be converted into the ε phase at high pressures, which shows a HCP crystal structure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Uses ==

=== Medical implants ===
Co-Cr alloys are most commonly used to make artificial joints including knee and hip joints due to high wear-resistance and biocompatibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Co-Cr alloys tend to be [[corrosion]] resistant, which reduces complication with the surrounding tissues when implanted, and chemically inert that they minimize the possibility of irritation, [[allergic reaction]], and [[immune response]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermawan, H.; Ramdan, D.; Djuansjah, J. R. P.; Metals for Biomedical Applications. ''Biomedical Engineering – From Theory to
Applications''. '''2011, '''410-430.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-Cr alloy has also been widely used in the manufacture of stent and other surgical implants as Co-Cr alloy demonstrates excellent biocompatibility with blood and soft tissues as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kereiakes, D. J.; Cox, D. A.; Hermiller, J. B.; Midei, M. G.; Usefulness of a Cobalt Chromium Coronary Stent Alloy. ''The Amer. J. Cardi. '''''2003, '''''92, ''463-466.'' ''&lt;/ref&gt; The alloy composition used in orthopedic implants is described in industry standard [[ASTM]]-F75:  cobalt with 27 to 30% [[chromium]], 5 to 7% [[molybdenum]], and limits on other important elements such as [[manganese]] and [[silicon]], less than 1%, [[iron]], less than 0.75%, [[nickel]], less than 0.5%, and [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[tungsten]], [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[boron]] etc.&lt;ref name="arcam" /&gt; 

Besides cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo), cobalt-nickel-chromium-molybdenum (CoNiCrMo) is also used for implants.&lt;ref name="intech"&gt;[http://www.intechopen.com/source/pdfs/10040/InTech-Biomimetic_porous_titanium_scaffolds_for_orthopedic_and_dental_applications.pdf Biomimetic Porous Titanium Scaffolds for Orthopedic and Dental Applications], Alireza Nouri, Peter D. Hodgson and Cui’e Wen (Institute for Technology Research and Innovation, Deakin University, Australia)&lt;/ref&gt; The possible toxicity of released Ni ions from CoNiCr alloys and also their limited frictional properties are a matter of concern in using these alloys as articulating components. Thus, CoCrMo is usually the dominant alloy for total joint [[arthroplasty]].&lt;ref name="intech" /&gt;

=== Dental prosthetics ===
[[File:Denture example 2.jpg|thumb|A Co-Cr partial denture.]]
Co-Cr alloy [[dentures]] and cast [[partial dentures]] have been commonly manufactured since 1929 due to lower cost and lower density compared to gold alloys; however, Co-Cr alloys tend to exhibit a higher [[modulus of elasticity]] and cyclic fatigue resistance, which are significant factors for dental prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, H.; Xu, M.; Zhang, H.; Wu, W.; Zheng, M.; Li, X. Cyclic Fatigue Properties of Cobalt-Chromium Alloy Clasps for Partial Removable Dental Protheses. ''J. Prosthetic Dent. '''''2010, '''''104, ''389-396.&lt;/ref&gt; The alloy is a commonly used as a metal framework for dental partials. A well known brand for this purpose is [[Vitallium]].

=== Industry ===
Due to mechanical properties such as high corrosion and wear resistance, Co-Cr alloys (eg. [[Stellite]]s) are used in making wind turbines, engine components, and many other industrial/mechanical components where high wear-resistance is needed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Co-Cr alloy is also very commonly used in fashion industry to make jewellery, especially wedding bands.

== Hazards ==
Metals released from Co-Cr alloy tools and prosthetics may cause allergic reactions and skin [[eczema]].&lt;ref&gt;Kettelarij, J. A.; Liden, C.; Axen, E.; Julander, A. Cobalt, Nickel, and Chromium Release

A '''crusher''' is a [[machine]] designed to reduce large [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s into smaller rocks, [[gravel]], or rock dust.

Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or [[recycled]], or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock [[ore]]), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated. Crushing is the process of transferring a force amplified by [[mechanical advantage]] through a material made of molecules that bond together more strongly, and resist deformation more, than those in the material being crushed do. Crushing devices hold material between two parallel or [[tangent]] solid surfaces, and apply sufficient force to bring the surfaces together to generate enough energy within the material being crushed so that its molecules separate from (fracturing), or change alignment in relation to (deformation), each other. The earliest crushers were hand-held stones, where the weight of the stone provided a boost to muscle power, used against a stone anvil. [[Querns]] and [[mortar and pestle|mortars]] are types of these crushing devices.

==Background history==
[[Image:Newcomen atmospheric engine animation.gif|frame|right|Animation of a schematic Newcomen steam engine.&lt;BR&gt;– Steam is shown pink and water is blue.&lt;BR&gt;– Valves move from open (green) to closed (red)&lt;!--Warning - animation size cannot be reduced--&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The '''[[Newcomen atmospheric engine|atmospheric engine]]''' invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712, often referred to simply as a '''Newcomen engine''', was the first practical device to harness the power of [[steam]] to produce [[mechanical work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcomen engines were used throughout [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Europe]], principally to pump water out of [[mining|mines]], starting in the early 18th century. [[James Watt]]'s later [[Watt steam engine]] was an improved version of the Newcomen engine.  As a result, Watt is today better known than Newcomen in relation to the origin of the steam engine.]]
In industry, crushers are machines which use a metal surface to break or compress materials into small fractional chunks or denser masses. Throughout most of industrial history, the greater part of crushing and mining part of the process occurred under muscle power as the application of force concentrated in the tip of the miners pick or sledge hammer driven drill bit. Before explosives came into widespread use in bulk mining in the mid-nineteenth century, most initial ore crushing and sizing was by hand and hammers at the mine or by water powered trip hammers in the small [[charcoal]] fired smithies and iron works typical of the [[Renaissance]] through the early-to-middle [[industrial revolution]]. It was only after explosives, and later early powerful [[steam shovel]]s produced large chunks of materials, chunks originally reduced by hammering in the mine before being loaded into sacks for a trip to the surface, chunks that were eventually also to lead to rails and mine railways transporting bulk aggregations that post-mine face crushing became widely necessary. The earliest of these were in the foundries, but as coal took hold the larger operations became the [[coal breaker]]s that fueled industrial growth from the first decade of the 1600s to the replacement of breakers in the 1970s through the fuel needs of the present day. The gradual coming of that era and displacement of the cottage industry based economies was itself accelerated first by the utility of wrought and cast iron as a desired materials giving impetus to larger operations, then in the late-sixteenth century by the increasing scarcity of wood lands for charcoal production to make the newfangled window glass&lt;ref name="Connections"&gt;&lt;!--

Other metallurgical developments such as silver and gold mining mirrored the practices and developments of the bulk material handling methods and technologies feeding the burgeoning appetite for more and more iron and glass, both of which were rare in personal possessions until the 1700s. 
 
Things only became worse when the English figured out how to cast the more economical iron cannons (1547), following on their feat of becoming the armorers of the European continent's powers by having been leading producers brass and bronze guns,&lt;ref name="Connections2"/&gt; and eventually by various acts of Parliament, gradually banned or restricted the further cutting of trees for charcoal in larger and larger regions in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Connections"/&gt; In 1611, a consortium led by courtier [[Edward Zouch]] was granted a patent for the [[reverberatory furnace]], a furnace using coal, not precious national timber reserves,&lt;ref name="Connections3"&gt;Burke, James, ''"Connections"'', page 168&lt;/ref&gt; which was immediately employed in glass making. An early politically connected and wealthy [[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber Baron figure]] Sir [[Robert Mansell]] bought his way into the fledgling furnace company wrested control of it, and by 1615 managed to have James I issued a proclamation forbidding the use of wood to produce glass,&lt;ref name="Connections3"/&gt; giving his families extensive coal holdings a monopoly on both source and means of production for nearly half-a-century. Abraham Darby a century later relocated to Bristol where he had established a building brass and bronze industry by importing Dutch workers and using them to raid Dutch techniques. Both materials were considered superior to iron for cannon, and machines as they were better understood. But Darby would change the world in several key ways.
 
Where the Dutch had failed in casting iron, one of Darby's apprentices, John Thomas succeeded in 1707&lt;ref name="connections170"&gt;Burke, James, ''"Connections"'', page 170&lt;/ref&gt; and as Burke put it: ''"had given England the key to the Industrial Revolution"&lt;ref name="connections170"/&gt;''. At the time, mines and [[foundry|foundries]] were virtually all small enterprises except for the tin mines (driven by the price and utility of brass) and materials came out of the mines already hammered small by legions of miners who had to stuff their work into carry sacks for pack animal slinging. Concurrently, mines needed drained resulting in [[Thomas Savery|Savery]] and Newcomen's early steam driven pumping systems. The deeper the mines went, the larger the demand became for better pumps, the greater the demand for iron, the greater the need for coal, the greater the demand for each. Seeing ahead clearly, Darby, sold off his brass business interests and relocated to [[Coalbrookdale]] with its plentiful coal mines, water power and nearby ore supplies. Over that decade his foundries developed iron casting technologies and began to supplant other metals in many applications. He adapted [[coke (fuel)|Coking]] of his fuel by copying Brewers practices.&lt;ref name="connections170"/&gt; In 1822 the pumping industries needs for larger cylinders met up with Darby's ability to melt sufficient quantities of pig iron to cast large inexpensive iron cylinders instead of costly brass ones,&lt;ref name="connections170"/&gt; reducing the cost of cylinders by nine-tenths.&lt;ref name="WorksOfMan"&gt;{{Cite book|author= |last1=Clark |first1=Ronald W. |authorlink1=Ronald W.

With gunpowder being increasingly applied to mining, rock chunks from a mining face became much larger, and the blast dependent mining itself had become dependent upon an organized group, not just an individual swinging a pick. Economies of scale gradually infused industrial enterprises, while transport became a key bottleneck as the volume of moved materials continued to increase following demand. This spurred numerous canal projects, inspired laying first wooden, then iron protected rails using draft animals to pull loads in the emerging bulk goods transportation dependent economy. In the coal industry, which grew up hand in hand as the preferred fuel for smelting ores, crushing and preparation (cleaning) was performed for over a hundred years in [[coal breaker]]s, massive noisy buildings full of conveyors, belt-powered trip-hammer crushing stages and giant metal grading/sorting grates. Like mine pumps, the internal conveyors and trip-hammers contained within these 7&amp;mdash;11 story buildings.

==Industrial use==
Mining operations use crushers, commonly classified by the degree to which they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally [[rockbreaker]]s are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical processing line at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a [[grinder (milling)#SAG mill|SAG mill]] followed by a [[grinder (milling)#Ball mill|ball mill]]. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.

In operation, the raw material (of various sizes) is usually delivered to the primary crusher's [[Chute (gravity)|hopper]] by [[dump truck]]s, [[excavators]] or wheeled front-end [[Loader (equipment)|loaders]]. A feeder device such as an apron feeder, [[conveyor]] or vibrating grid controls the rate at which this material enters the crusher, and often contains a preliminary screening device which allows smaller material to bypass the crusher itself, thus improving efficiency. Primary crushing reduces the large pieces to a size which can be handled by the downstream machinery.

Some crushers are mobile and can crush rocks as large as 60 inches. Primarily used in-pit at the mine face these units are able to move with the large infeed machines (mainly shovels) to increase the tonnage produced.  In a mobile road operation, these crushed rocks are directly combined with concrete and [[asphalt]] which are then deposited on to a road surface.  This removes the need for hauling oversized material to a stationary crusher and then back to the road surface.

===Jaw crusher===
[[File:Scheme Jaw Crusher.gif|thumb|Operation of a dodge type jaw crusher]]
[[File:Dodge type jaw crusher.jpg|thumb|Dodge type jaw crusher]]
A    jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking of particle.  This mechanical pressure is achieved by the two jaws of the crusher of which one is fixed while the other reciprocates. A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a [[cam]] or [[Connecting rod|pitman]] mechanism, acting like a class II [[lever]] or a [[nutcracker]]. The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber. The movement of the swing jaw can be quite small, since complete crushing is not performed in one stroke. The inertia required to crush the material is provided by a weighted flywheel that moves a shaft creating an eccentric motion that causes the closing of the gap.

Jaw crushers are heavy duty machines and hence need to be robustly constructed. The outer frame is generally made of cast iron or steel. The jaws themselves are usually constructed from cast steel. They are fitted with replaceable liners which are made of manganese steel, or Ni-hard (a Ni-Cr alloyed cast iron). Jaw crushers are usually constructed in sections to ease the process transportation if they are to be taken underground for carrying out the operations.

Jaw crushers are classified on the basis of the position of the pivoting of the swing jaw
#Blake crusher-the swing jaw is fixed at the upper position
#Dodge crusher-the swing jaw is fixed at the lower position
#Universal crusher-the swing jaw is fixed at an intermediate position

The Blake crusher was patented by Eli Whitney Blake in 1858. The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area. Blake crushers are of two types- single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers.

In the single toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher. The swing jaw, suspended on the eccentric, undergoes two types of motion- swing motion towards the fixed jaw due to the action of toggle plate and vertical movement due the rotation of the eccentric. These two motions, when combined, lead to an elliptical jaw motion. This motion is useful as it assists in pushing the particles through the crushing chamber. This phenomenon leads to higher capacity of the single toggle jaw crushers but it also results in higher wear of the crushing jaws. These type of jaw crushers are preferred for the crushing of softer particles.

In the double toggle jaw crushers, the oscillating motion of the swing jaw is caused by the vertical motion of the pitman. The pitman moves up and down. The swing jaw closes, i.e., it moves towards the fixed jaw when the pitman moves upward and opens during the downward motion of the pitman. This type is commonly used in mines due to its ability to crush tough and abrasive materials.

In the Dodge type jaw crushers, the jaws are farther apart at the top than at the bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the material is crushed progressively smaller and smaller as it travels downward until it is small enough to escape from the bottom opening. The Dodge jaw crusher has a variable feed area and a fixed discharge area which leads to choking of the crusher and hence is used only for laboratory purposes and not for heavy duty operations.

===Gyratory crusher===
[[File:Ruffner Red Ore Mine gyratory crusher, North of I-20 at Madrid Exit, Birmingham (Jefferson County, Alabama).jpg|thumb|right|180 px|Ruffner Red Ore Mine gyratory crusher]]
A gyratory crusher is similar in basic concept to a jaw crusher, consisting of a concave surface and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an [[eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] arrangement. As with the jaw crusher, material travels downward between the two surfaces being progressively crushed until it is small enough to fall out through the gap between the two surfaces.

A gyratory crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to gyrate. The vertical spindle is free to rotate around its own axis. The crusher illustrated is a short-shaft suspended spindle type, meaning that the main shaft is suspended at the top and that the eccentric is mounted above the gear. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design in which the eccentric is mounted below the gear.

===Cone crusher===
With the rapid development of mining technology, the cone crusher can be divided into four types: compound cone crusher, spring cone crusher, hydraulic cone crusher and gyratory crusher. According to different models, the cone crusher is divided into VSC series cone crusher (compound cone crusher), Symons cone crusher, PY cone crusher, single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher, multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher, gyratory crusher, etc.

A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken once, and then fall to a lower position (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again. This process continues until the pieces are small enough to fall through the narrow opening at the bottom of the crusher.

A cone crusher is suitable for crushing a variety of mid-hard and above mid-hard ores and rocks. It has the advantage of reliable construction, high productivity, easy adjustment and lower operational costs. The spring release system of a cone crusher acts an overload protection that allows tramp to pass through the crushing chamber without damage to the crusher.

==== Compound cone crusher ====
Compound cone crusher(VSC series cone crusher) can crush materials of over medium hardness. It is mainly used in mining, chemical industry, road and bridge construction, building, etc. As for VSC series cone crusher, there are four crushing cavities (coarse, medium, fine and superfine) to choose. Compared with the same type, VSC series cone crusher, whose combination of crushing frequency and eccentricity is the best, can make materials have higher comminution degree and higher yield. In addition, VSC series cone crusher’s enhanced laminating crushing effect on material particles makes the cubic shape of crushed materials better, which increases the selling point.

==== Symons cone crusher ====
Symons cone crusher (spring cone crusher) can crush materials of above medium hardness. And it is widely used in metallurgy, building, hydropower, transportation, chemical industry, etc. When used with jaw crusher, it can be used as secondary, tertiary or quaternary crushing. Generally speaking, the standard type of Symons cone crusher is applied to medium crushing. The medium type is applied to fine crushing. The short head type is applied to coarse fine crushing. As casting steel technique is adopted, the machine has good rigidity and large high strength.

==== Single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher ====
Single cylinder hydraulic cone crusher is mainly composed of main frame, transmission device, eccentric shaft, bowl-shaped bearing, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, dust-proof ring, feed plate, etc.

==== Multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher ====
Multi-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches and leaves the surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.

===Impact crusher===
Impact crushers involve the use of [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] rather than [[pressure]] to crush material. The material is contained within a cage, with openings on the bottom, end, or side of the desired size to allow pulverized material to escape.  There are two types of impact crushers: horizontal shaft impactor and vertical shaft impactor.

====Horizontal shaft impactor (HSI) / Hammermill====
The HSI crushers break rock by impacting the rock with hammers that are fixed upon the outer edge of a spinning rotor. HSI machines are sold in Stationary, trailer mounted and crawler mounted configurations. HSI's are used in recycling, hard rock and soft materials. In earlier years the practical use of HSI crushers is limited to soft materials and non abrasive materials, such as [[limestone]], [[phosphate]], [[gypsum]], weathered [[shale]]s, however improvements in metallurgy has changed the application of these machines.

====Vertical shaft impactor (VSI)====
[[File:Scheme vsi crusher.jpg|thumb|Scheme of a VSI crusher with air-cushion support]]
[[Image:T80 7.jpg|thumb|VSI crusher]]
VSI crushers use a different approach involving a high speed rotor with wear resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize [[velocity]] rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force ([[pressure]]) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing [[velocity]] rather than surface force allows the breaking force to be applied evenly both across the surface of the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural [[fissures]] (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these [[fissures]]. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the [[velocity]] at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE [[highway]] [[asphalt]] applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.

VSI crushers generally utilize a high speed spinning rotor at the center of the crushing chamber and an outer impact surface of either abrasive resistant metal anvils or crushed rock. Utilizing cast metal surfaces 'anvils' is traditionally referred to as a "Shoe and Anvil VSI". Utilizing crushed rock on the outer walls of the crusher for new rock to be crushed against is traditionally referred to as "rock on rock VSI". VSI crushers can be used in static plant set-up or in mobile tracked equipment.

===Mineral sizers===
The basic concept of the mineral sizer is the use of two rotors with large teeth, on small diameter shafts, driven at a low speed by a direct high torque drive system. This design produces three major principles which all interact when breaking materials using sizer technology. The unique principles are the three-stage breaking action, the rotating screen effect, and the deep scroll tooth pattern.

The three-stage breaking action: initially, the material is gripped by the leading faces of opposed rotor teeth. These subject the rock to multiple point loading, inducing stress into the material to exploit any natural weaknesses. At the second stage, material is broken in tension by being subjected to a three-point loading, applied between the front tooth faces on one rotor, and rear tooth faces on the other rotor. Any lumps of material that still remain oversize, are broken as the rotors chop through the fixed teeth of the breaker bar, thereby achieving a three dimensional controlled product size.

The rotating screen effect: The interlaced toothed rotor design allows free flowing undersize material to pass through the continuously changing gaps generated by the relatively slow moving shafts.

The deep scroll tooth pattern: The deep scroll conveys the larger material to one end of the machine and helps to spread the feed across the full length of the rotors. This feature can also be used to reject oversize material from the machine.&lt;ref&gt;The MMD Group of Companies."MMD Sizers". The MMD Group of Companies, 2005, p 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crusher Bucket===
[[File:Crusher bucket quarry.jpg|thumb|This is a crusher bucket, crushing rock in a quarry, for recycling the material previously extracted.]]
A crusher bucket is an attachment for hydraulic excavators. Its way of working consists on a bucket with two crushing jaws inside, one of them is fixed and the other one moves back and forth relative to it, as in a [[Jaw crusher]].
They are manufactured with a high inertia power train, circular jaw movement and an antiestagnation plate, which prevents large shredding pieces from getting stuck in the bucket's mouth, not allowing them to enter the crushing jaws. They have also the crushing jaws placed in a cross position. This position together with its circular motion gives these crusher buckets the faculty of grinding wet material.
[[File:Crushing jaws movement in a Xcentric Crusher bucket.png|thumb|This is the crushing jaws movement in a Xcentric Crusher bucket, with a patented technology.]]

==Technology==
For the most part advances in crusher design have moved slowly. Jaw crushers have remained virtually unchanged for sixty years. More reliability and higher production have been added to basic cone crusher designs that have also remained largely unchanged. Increases in rotating speed have provided the largest variation. For instance, a 48-inch (120&amp;nbsp;cm) cone crusher manufactured in 1960 may be able to produce 170 tons/h of crushed rock, whereas the same size crusher manufactured today may produce 300 tons/h. These production improvements come from speed increases and better crushing chamber designs.

The largest advance in cone crusher reliability has been seen in the use of hydraulics to protect crushers from being damaged when uncrushable objects enter the crushing chamber. Foreign objects, such as [[steel]], can cause extensive damage to a cone crusher, and additional costs in lost production. The advance of hydraulic relief systems has greatly reduced downtime and improved the life of these machines.

The same species is also known by the names ''Cyrtosperma lasioides'', ''Cyrtosperma chamissonis'' and ''Cyrtosperma edule''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITIS report, Cyrtosperma merkusii|url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=506754|publisher=Integrated Taxonomic Information System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the harsh [[atoll]] environments of the Central Pacific, especially [[Tuvalu]] and [[Kiribati]], swamp taro is an important source of [[carbohydrate]]s in a diet dominated by fish and coconut.  Its cultivation is difficult and time-consuming, and the plant has deep cultural as well as practical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Gerd|title=The material culture of Tuvalu|publisher=Institute of Pacific Studies, [[University of the South Pacific]]|date=1983–1990|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7aeiuIXVigC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;{{cite book|last=Koch|first=Gerd|title=The Material Culture of Kiribati|year=1986|publisher=Institute of Pacific Studies, [[University of the South Pacific]]|isbn=978-982-02-0008-1|url=http://www.kiribatibooks.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The roots need to be cooked for hours to reduce toxicity in the [[corm]]s, but are rich in nutrients, especially [[calcium]].&lt;ref name="un"/&gt; The cultivation of [[Pulaka]] in Tuvalu, and [[Babai (Swamp Taro)|babai]] in Kiribati, is an important cultural and culinary tradition, now under threat from rising [[sea level]] and displacement from the growing use of imported food products.

In [[Nepal]], Giant Swamp Taro is called ''mane'' and grows in the tropical and sub tropical forests along stream banks. It is gathered in January–February and all plant parts (leaf, stem, rhizomes) are savored after being boiled and roasted. The stem requires prolonged boiling and the water is replaced once to remove irritating chemicals. If cooked carefully, the rhizomes taste like taro and the leaves like spinach. But without careful washing, the food causes an unpleasant tingling or scratchy sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Limbu|first=Prakash|title=Nepal Food Culture|year=2012|publisher=ICIMOD [Kathmandu Nepal]|url=http://agrobiodiversityplatform.org/files/2012/03/Chepang-Food-Culture_Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==
Giant swamp taro is the largest of the root crop plants known collectively as [[Taro]], which are cultivated throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific.  Although outwardly similar to [[Colocasia esculenta]], the most widely cultivated taro, it belongs to a different genus.  The plant may reach heights of 4–6 metres, with leaves and roots much larger than Colocasia esculenta. The sagitate leaves are up to 6' 7" (2&amp;nbsp;meters) long by up to four feet (120&amp;nbsp;cm) in width, borne atop [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s or stalks up to 19' 6" (6&amp;nbsp;meters)in length and four inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) wide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appropedia.org/Original:Root_Crops_29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deni Bown, AROIDS - PLANTS OF THE ARUM FAMILY (Portland: Timber Press, 2000 revised edit.) p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/MI/plants/iaraj.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is relatively resistant to disease and pests but is susceptible to [[taro beetle]].  The [[corm]], which can reach weights of 80&amp;nbsp;kg or even 220 pounds (100&amp;nbsp;kg) with a diameter of up to 39 inches (1&amp;nbsp;meter) and equally long.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.germanwatch.org/download/klak/Fb_tuv_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is starchy and cream or pink in colour, with a taste similar to [[sweet potato]], though it is drier in texture.

==Cultivation==

Giant swamp taro is not suitable for growing in upland or rainfed conditions; it has adapted to growth within fresh water and coastal swamps. It exhibits some shade tolerance and is considered mildly tolerant of saline growing conditions compared to other taro species; that is, it can be grown in mildly brackish water.  It is a slow growing crop which can take up to 15 years to mature.

Giant swamp taro is nearly the only [[carbohydrate]] crop that can be cultivated on low-lying coral atolls, where it is grown in purpose-built swamp pits dug to below the level of the [[freshwater lens]].  The cultivation of [[Pulaka]] in Tuvalu, and of [[Babai (Swamp Taro)|babai]] in Kiribati, has deep cultural significance.  In these harsh environments, its cultivation is increasingly threatened by rising sea levels caused by [[global warming]]: the plant does not thrive in brackish water,&lt;ref name="knox"&gt;{{Cite news

==Preparation==

Giant swamp taro contains [[toxins]] which must be removed by long cooking.  It may be field stored in the ground for very long periods – up to 30 years or more – and 
accordingly has traditionally been an important emergency crop in times of natural disaster and food scarcity.&lt;ref name=fao /&gt;  The cooked corms can be dried in the sun and stored for later use.&lt;ref name=Koch /&gt;  Different methods of preparation are used for [[pulaka]] in Tuvalu, and [[Babai (Swamp Taro)|babai]] in Kiribati.

'''Debris''' or '''débris''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|ɛ|b|r|iː|,_|ˈ|d|eɪ|b|r|iː}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|iː}}) is [[rubble]], wreckage, [[ruins]], [[litter]] and discarded [[waste|garbage/refuse/trash]], scattered remains of something destroyed, discarded, or as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier etc. Depending on context, ''debris'' can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French  word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, Sir Philip. (1701). Memoires of the Reigne of King Charles I: With a continuation to the happy restoration of King Charles II. London: Ri.Chiswell. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, [[tornado]]s leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado's winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado's wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==
[[Image:ObsidianDomeCA.JPG|thumb|[[Obsidian]] debris (talus), Obsidian Dome, [[California]].]]
In [[geology]], debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including [[landslide]]s, [[volcanic]] explosions, [[avalanches]], [[Mudslide|mudflows]] or [[Glacial lake outburst flood]]s (Jökulhlaups) and [[moraine]], [[lahars]], and [[lava]] eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a [[stream]] called a [[debris flow]].  When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called "talus" or "[[scree]]".

In [[mining]], debris called ''attle'' usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
{{Main|marine debris}}
[[Image:Marine debris on Hawaiian coast.jpg|thumb|[[Marine debris]] washed ashore on [[Hawaii]]]]
''Marine debris'' applies to floating garbage such as [[bottles]], [[Tin can|cans]], [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], cruise [[ship]] waste, offshore [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[gas]] exploration and production facilities [[pollution]], and [[fishing]] paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called [[litter]] or [[flotsam and jetsam]]. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used [[automobile]] [[tires]], [[detergent]] [[bottles]], [[medical waste]]s, discarded fishing line and [[Net (device)|nets]], soda cans, and [[bilge]] waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, [[boats]], [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[underwater diving|divers]], and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea [[turtle]]s, [[fish]], and marine [[mammal]]s become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. [[Whales]] mistake [[plastic]] bags for [[squid]], and [[birds]] may mistake plastic pellets for fish [[roe|eggs]]. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]].

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In [[meteorology]], debris usually applies to the remains of [[human]] habitation and natural [[flora (plants)|flora]] after [[storm]] related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as '''storm debris'''. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed [[tree]] [[branch|limbs]], downed [[wikt:signs|signs]], downed [[power line]]s and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
{{See also|debris ball|road debris}}

==Space==
{{Main|space debris}}
''Space debris'' usually refers to the remains of [[spacecraft]] that have either fallen to [[Earth]] or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[ice]]. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth [[orbit]] and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both [[satellite]] and manned vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these  items, ranging in size from [[nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[Screw|bolts]] to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000&amp;nbsp;km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a [[meteor]].

A [[debris disk]] is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In [[medicine]], debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in [[surgical instruments]] and is referred to as '''surgical debris'''. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or [[nosocomial infection]]s if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly [[disinfect]]ed.

==War==
[[Image:Boys Toys edit.jpg|thumb|right|A child plays on an abandoned tank outside [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]] in 1991]]
In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with ''war debris'' in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, [[unexploded ordnance]], bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many [[Mine clearance agencies]] are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

[[Land mines]] in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V to the 1980 Convention)

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are [[Afghanistan]], [[Angola]], [[Cambodia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Laos]].

Similarly ''military debris'' may be found in and around [[firing range]]s and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as [[Cover (military)|cover]] for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana's [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Creole]] and [[Cajun]] cultures, debris (pronounced "DAY-bree") refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9296">In 1988, the Russian Soviet physicist Mikhail (Michel) I. Dyakonov theoretically predicted a new class of [[surface electromagnetic wave]]s, now called '''Dyakonov surface waves''' ('''DSWs''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dyakonov| first = M. I. | title = New type of electromagnetic wave propagating at an interface|url=http://www.jetp.ac.ru/cgi-bin/dn/e_067_04_0714.pdf|format=Free PDF download|journal =Soviet Physics JETP| volume =67|issue =4| pages =714|date = April 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other types of [[acoustics|acoustic]] and [[electromagnetic waves|electromagnetic]] surface waves, the DSW's existence is due to the difference in '''[[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]]''' of materials forming the interface. He considered the interface between an [[isotropic]] transmitting [[transmission medium|medium]] and an anisotropic [[uniaxial crystal]], and showed that under certain conditions waves localized at the interface should exist. Later, similar waves were predicted to exist at the interface between two identical uniaxial crystals with [[orientation (geometry)|different orientations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Averkiev| first = N. S. and Dyakonov, M. I.| title =Electromagnetic waves localized at the interface of transparent anisotropic media |journal =Optics and Spectroscopy (USSR)| volume =68| issue = 5|pages =653|date = 1990| bibcode = 1990OptSp..68..653A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The previously known electromagnetic surface waves, [[surface plasmons]] and [[surface plasmon polaritons]], exist under the condition that the [[permittivity]] of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive (for example, this is the case for the air/metal interface below the [[plasma frequency]]).  In contrast, the DSW can propagate when both materials are transparent; hence they are virtually lossless, which is their most fascinating property.

In recent years, the significance and potential of the DSW have attracted the attention of many researchers: a change of the constitutive properties of one or both of the two partnering materials – due to, say, infiltration by any chemical or biological agent – could measurably change the characteristics of the wave. Consequently, numerous potential applications are envisaged, including devices for integrated optics, chemical and biological surface sensing, etc.&lt;ref&gt;

== Physical properties ==

The simplest configuration considered in Ref. 1 consists of an interface between an isotropic material with permittivity ε and a uniaxial crystal with permittivities εo and εe for the ordinary and the [[extraordinary wave]]s respectively. The crystal ''C'' axis is parallel to the interface. For this configuration, the DSW can propagate along the interface within certain angular intervals with respect to the ''C'' axis, provided that the condition of  εe &gt; ε &gt; εo is satisfied. Thus DSW are supported by interfaces with positive birefringent crystals only (εe &gt; εo).  The angular interval is defined by the parameter η =εe/εo − 1. The angular intervals for the DSW phase and group velocities (Δθph and Δθgr) are different. The phase velocity interval is proportional to η^2 and even for the most strongly birefringent natural crystals is very narrow Δθph ≃ 1° ([[rutile]]) and Δθph ≃4° ([[calomel]]). However the physically more important group velocity interval is substantially larger (proportional to  η). Calculations give Δθgr ≃ 7° for rutile, and Δθgr ≃ 20° for calomel.

== Perspectives ==

A widespread experimental investigation of DSW material systems and evolution of related practical devices has been largely limited by the stringent [[anisotropy]] conditions necessary for successful DSW propagation, particularly the high degree of [[birefringence]] of at least one of the constituent materials and the limited number of naturally available materials fulfilling this requirement. However, this is about to change in light of novel artificially engineered metamaterials and revolutionary material synthesis techniques.

The extreme sensitivity of DSW to anisotropy, and thereby to stress, along with their low-loss (long-range) character render them particularly attractive for enabling high sensitivity tactile and ultrasonic sensing for next-generation high-speed transduction and read-out technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">'''Edison Sault Electric Company''' was a public utility that provided electricity to the eastern portion of [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula]]. Its service area covered four counties ([[Chippewa County, Michigan|Chippewa]], [[Mackinac County, Michigan|Mackinac]], [[Schoolcraft County, Michigan|Schoolcraft]] and [[Delta County, Michigan|Delta]]).

==History==
The company was founded in 1892 in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]].

[[Wisconsin Energy Corporation]] acquired the Edison Sault Electric Company with its purchase of its parent company, ESELCO in 1998.

In 2009, Wisconsin Energy announced it had reached a definitive agreement to sell Edison Sault Electric to the [[Cloverland Electric Cooperative]] of [[Dafter, Michigan|Dafter]].

==System information==
Edison Sault's only generating station was the [[Saint Marys Falls Hydropower Plant]] located on the [[St. Marys River (Michigan-Ontario)|St. Marys River]] in downtown Sault Ste. Marie. During the night when demand was low, the company was able to sell power from this small dam to larger companies such as [[Upper Peninsula Power Company]] and [[Consumers Energy]]. Edison Sault's transmission system voltage is 138,000 volts. The subtransmission system voltage is 69,000 volts. The distribution system voltage is 13,200 volts.

==Interconnections==
Edison Sault had four 138 kV interconnections with other utilities. Two were with Consumers Energy in lower Michigan. (McGulpin-Straits #1 and McGulpin-Straits #2) These two lines are submerged under the [[Straits of Mackinac]]. Edison Sault has two interconnections with its former sister company, Wisconsin Electric (Arnold-Indian Lake #1 and Arnold-Indian Lake #2).

Edison Sault had interconnections with Cloverland Electric and Upper Peninsula Power on its 69 kV subtransmission system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19579">'''Energy security of the People's Republic of China''' concerns the need for the [[People's Republic of China]] to guarantee itself and its industries long- term access to sufficient energy and raw materials. China has been endeavoring to sign international agreements and secure such supplies; its energy security involves the internal and foreign energy policy of China. Currently, China's energy portfolio consists mainly of [[Coal power in China|domestic coal]], [[oil]] and [[gas]] from domestic and foreign sources, and small quantities of [[uranium]]. China has also created a [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve (China)|strategic petroleum reserve]], to secure emergency supplies of oil for temporary price and supply disruptions. Chinese policy focuses on diversification to reduce oil imports, which rely almost exclusively on producers in the Middle East.

According to Professor Zha Daojiong, China's dependence on foreign sources of energy is not a threat to China's energy security, since the world energy market is not opposed to China's pursuit of growth and prosperity.&lt;ref name="CES, p53-54"&gt;CES, p53-54&lt;/ref&gt; The key issue is actually internal: growing internal consumption without [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] threatens both China's growth and world oil markets. Chinese imports are a new determinant encouraging oil price rises on the world market, a concern to developed countries.&lt;ref name="CES, p53-54" /&gt; The international community advocates a move toward energy efficiency and more transparency in China's quest for energy worldwide, to confirm China's responsibility as a member of the international community. Energy efficiency is the only way to avoid excessive Chinese demands on oil at the expense of industrialized and industrializing countries.&lt;ref name="CES, p53-54" /&gt; International projects and [[technology transfers]] are ongoing, improving China's energy consumption and benefit the whole energy-importing world; this will also calm Western-Chinese diplomatic tensions.&lt;ref name="CES, p53-54" /&gt; China is trying to establish long-term energy security by investment in oil and gas fields abroad and by diversifying its providers.&lt;ref name="CQE, p12-15"&gt;CQE, p12-15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:China-Today oil reserves and demand-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Chinese oil reserves]]
Thanks to the transfer of Soviet oil extraction technologies [[Sino-Soviet split|prior to July 1960]] and domestic reserves such as the [[Daqing oil field]], the PRC became oil self-sufficient in 1963.&lt;ref name="CES, p39-40"&gt;CES, p39-40&lt;/ref&gt; A US-led [[embargo]] isolated the [[Petroleum industry in the People's Republic of China|Chinese oil industry]] from 1950 to 1970, preventing it from selling on the world [[Price of petroleum|oil market]]. After the embargo was lifted, China reactivated its links with Japan and other industrialized nations thanks to its oil exports, which helped bring in foreign currencies and fund key industrial plants and technologies for developing its own export-oriented economy.&lt;ref name="CES, p39-40" /&gt; Chinese oil exports peaked in 1985 at 30&amp;nbsp;million tons. Rapid reforms, in turn, increased domestic oil demand and led China to become a net oil importer in 1993, and net crude oil importer in 1996.&lt;ref name="CES, p39-40" /&gt;

&lt;!-- New deal --&gt;
Since 1996 Chinese oil production has slowly and continuously decreased, while demand and imports have steadily increased.&lt;ref name="CES, p41"&gt;CES, p41&lt;/ref&gt; Future Chinese oil reserves (such as the [[Tarim basin]]) are difficult to extract, requiring specific technologies as well as the construction of pipelines thousands of kilometers long. As a result, such reserves would be very difficult to develop and not cost-effective, given current market prices.&lt;ref&gt;IEA, p72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CES, p52"&gt;CES, p52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues that China faces ==
[[File:China Gas Production vs Consumption.png|thumb|Natural gas production in China (red) has not kept up with consumption (black), requiring increased imports of gas.]]

{{Main|Energy policy of China|Renewable energy in China}}

=== China's demand for oil ===
[[File:China Oil Production vs Consumption.png|thumb|Oil production in China (red) has not kept up with rapidly increasing demand (black).]]

China accounts for 40% of the 2004 oil-consumption increase, and thus is a key part of the cycle which had led to the [[2000s energy crisis|oil price increase worldwide]].&lt;ref name="CES, p44-45"&gt;CES, p44-45&lt;/ref&gt; China's import dependence remains at 60% as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=470|title = The Outlook for a Chinese Pivot to Gas|last = Chen|first = Weidong|date = July 24, 2014|work = The National Bureau of Asian Reseasrch|accessdate = August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a campaign to increase energy efficiency was launched without official Ministry of Energy approval; since the campaign was sporadic, this objective seems hard to meet. Zha Daojiong encouraged increased management of oil and energy in China, noting that "It is fair to say that the threat from ineffective energy industry governance is probably as great as that from the international energy market.".&lt;ref name="CES, p44-45" /&gt;  A projection that China would reach South Korean levels of per-capita oil consumption in 30 years, combined with the current average global decline in production, could mean that up to {{convert|44|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} (barrels per day) in production would have to be found in the next decade to keep up with increased demand and production declines.  That would be the equivalent of roughly five times Saudi Arabia's production.   Superimpose a production plateau of {{convert|100|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, and significant real-price increases would be necessary to balance supply and demand. Such increases might have severe effects on the growth of emerging market economies such as China's.

===Nuclear and coal===
[[Nuclear power in China]] accounts for approximately 1.4% of China's electricity, which is considered relatively low compared to other developing nations. China still mainly relies on [[coal]] for electricity. China is first in the world in both coal production and consumption, which has sparked environmental concerns. In order to achieve environmental targets in combating [[pollution]] and [[global warming]], China must ultimately improve its coal efficiency and switch to alternative energy sources.&lt;ref name="CES, p47-49" /&gt;

===Limitations of pipelines and stocks===
China's eastern and southern regions have chronic energy shortages, causing blackouts and limiting economic growth. For supplying these regions, [[liquefied natural gas]] from Australia and Indonesia is more feasible and cheaper to import than the [[Tarim basin]] pipeline.&lt;ref name="CES, p52"&gt;CES, p52&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first [[West–East Gas Pipeline]] from [[Xinjiang]] to [[Shanghai]] was commissioned in 2004,&lt;ref name=peopledaily1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinopec]] accounts for 80% of Chinese oil imports.&lt;ref name="CES, p50"&gt;CES, p50&lt;/ref&gt; Refinery capacity is continuously strained, and perennially lags behind fast domestic-demand growth. China has had to rely on entrepôt refineries located in Singapore, Japan and Korea.&lt;ref name="IEA, p74"&gt;IEA, p74&lt;/ref&gt; Oil and gas exploration in the Tarim Basin is ongoing. However, developing this potential reserve is currently not cost-effective due to technological limitations coupled with fluctuations in world oil prices. Therefore, this is considered by some as a last-resort option.&lt;!-- IEA, p71-73 ??? --&gt;

In China, the gas price is not market-driven, which causes uncertainty in the production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=470|title = The Outlook for a Chinese Pivot to Gas|last = Chen|first = Weidong|date = July 24, 2014|work = The National Bureau of Asian Research|accessdate = August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy efficiency ===
A key point for China's energy-security goal of reducing oil imports is to improve the efficiency of its domestic energy markets by accelerating pricing, regulatory and other reforms. China is actively looking for smart-energy technology.&lt;ref name="CGQ, p.18"&gt;CGQ, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
On the issue of energy security, China relies mainly on [[Persian Gulf]] exports. In contrast with the USA, China is not associated with the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]s and may focus simply on oil supply from an economic standpoint. The increase in Chinese dependence on Persian Gulf oil also means an associated increasing economic dependence on Arabian exporters, who will probably not join hands to block exports to China.&lt;ref name="CES, p43"&gt;CES, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese dependence on the Middle East is also a cause of concern for the US. In 2004, when the Bush administration actively discouraged oil companies from investing in Iran, the Chinese company [[Sinopec]] did not comply with its call.&lt;ref name="CES, p50" /&gt;

Recently, China has changed its anti-Western diplomatic stance to a softer, global, more efficient diplomacy with a focus on energy and raw-materials security. In post-2003 Iraq, China does its best to comply with UN sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;IEA, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan and Korea===
When China became an oil importer during the 1990s, its relations with neighboring countries (as exporter to East Asia and importer of Korean and Japanese oil) changed. Its main oil provider changed in a few years from domestic production, to East Asian production, and then to Mideast production. On the other hand, despite insufficient domestic oil output China does its best to stabilize exports to Japan and Korea. China endeavors to continue energy relationships it has created with developed nations, since they contribute to China's energy security with investment and technology.&lt;ref name="IEA, p74"/&gt;  More Chinese oil output is in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and world interests. Since China lacks strategic entrepôt refineries, it relies heavily on refineries in Singapore, Japan, and Korea.&lt;ref name="IEA, p75"&gt;IEA, p75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
China's dependence on foreign oil weakens its ability to pressure [[Taiwan]], since a conflict may trigger a US oil embargo as a consequence.&lt;ref name="CES, p43-44"&gt;CES, p43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Since Sudan is pro-Chinese and [[Chad]] was pro-Taiwan (and an oil producer since 2003), China had an interest in replacing Chad's president [[Idriss Déby]] with a pro-Chinese leader. The FUC Chad rebellion, based in Sudan and aiming to overthrow the pro-Taiwanese Déby, seems to have received Chinese diplomatic support as well as weapons and Sudanese oil. The [[2006 Chadian coup d'état attempt]] failed after [[French Air Force]] intervention, but Déby then switched his friendship to Beijing; the field defeat became a Chinese strategic victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Chinafrique: Pékin à la conquête du continent noir

===Russia===
In February 2009, Russia and China signed an agreement in which a spur of the [[Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] to China would be built and Russia would supply China with 15&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of oil ({{convert|300000|oilbbl|m3}} per day) each year for 20&amp;nbsp;years, in exchange for a loan worth US$25&amp;nbsp;billion to Russian companies [[Transneft]] and [[Rosneft]] for pipeline and oilfield development.&lt;ref name=finance&gt;

===Australia===
On August 19, 2009, Chinese petroleum company [[PetroChina]] signed an A$50&amp;nbsp;billion deal with American multinational petroleum company [[ExxonMobil]] to purchase liquefied natural gas from the Gorgon field in [[Western Australia]];&lt;ref&gt;Stephen McDonell, August 19, 2009, [http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2009/s2660091.htm Record gas deal between China and Australia - AM] - Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babs McHugh, August 19, 2009, [http://www.abc.net.au/rural/content/2008/s2660434.htm Massive sale from Gorgon Gas Project] - Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; this was believed to be the largest contract ever signed between China and America – ensuring China a steady supply of [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG fuel]] for 20&amp;nbsp;years, and comprising China's largest supply of relatively clean energy.&lt;ref&gt;David McLennan, August 20, 2009, [http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/national/national/general/australia-to-be-global-supplier-of-clean-energy/1601141.aspx Australia to be 'global supplier of clean energy'] - The Canberra Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;August 20, 2009, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2009-08/20/content_8592558.htm CNPC to import 2.25m tons of LNG annually from Australia] - ChinaDaily (Source: Xinhua)&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement has been formalised despite [[Australia – People's Republic of China relations|relations between Australia and China]] being at their lowest point in years following the [[Rio Tinto espionage case]] and the [[Melbourne International Film Festival#Screening of controversial film and support for Uyghur spokesperson Rebiya Kadeer by the 14th Dalai Lama|granting of a visa]] to [[Rebiya Kadeer]] to visit Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ryan, August 19, 2009, [http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2009/s2660092.htm Deal means 2.2&amp;nbsp;million tonnes exported per year - AM] - Australian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sea lanes ===
Ratification of the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] is linked to China's need to secure its oil and raw materials shipping from the Middle East, Africa, and Europe,&lt;ref name="IEA, p75" /&gt; since those materials have to pass through the [[Strait of Malacca]] and the [[Red Sea]].

=== Oil diplomacy ===
The appearance of China on the [[oil diplomacy|world energy scene]] is somewhat disturbing for developed nations. China's relative energy inexperience also raises diplomatic difficulties. Strengthening ties with oil producers such as [[Iran]], [[Sudan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Angola]] and [[Venezuela]] also raised concerns for U.S. and other Western diplomacy, since several of these countries are known to be [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] and/or known for [[human rights]] abuses, [[political censorship]], and widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name="CES, p47-49"&gt;CES, p47-49&lt;/ref&gt; These moves seem to challenge Western powers, by strengthening anti-Western countries. But this is unlikely; as a developing consumer economy,&lt;ref&gt;CES, p48&lt;/ref&gt; China does not have much of a choice in its sources of supply.&lt;ref name="CES, p53"&gt;CES, p53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor communication===
It is claimed that Chinese oil companies are unaccustomed to political risks and avoiding diplomatic conflict. In any case, the Chinese government will still be seen as ultimately responsible for conflict resolution.&lt;ref name="CES, p47-49" /&gt; Communication has also been a weak point for Chinese companies. Lack of transparency in cases such as Chinese involvement in Sudan have raised concern in the US, until it was revealed that most of the oil produced was sold on international markets.&lt;ref name="CES, p51"&gt;CES, p51&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of cooperation with other major oil companies has led to business clashes, spilling into the diplomatic arena when both sides call their respective governments to support their interests ([[CNOOC]] versus [[Chevron-Texaco]] for [[Unocal]], for example).&lt;ref name="CES, p51"/&gt;

The '''third-generation Ford Taurus''' is an [[automobile]] that was manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1995 to 1999.

The third generation of [[Ford Taurus]] was the first to be completely redesigned from the ground up, and used a rounded, oval-derived design that was very controversial at the time, considered to be the main reason for this model's downfall in the market.&lt;ref name="CG encyclopedia" /&gt; It was designed to appeal to buyers of the [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Honda Accord]]&lt;ref name="News96" /&gt; — both of which were similarly styled — as well as to make Ford a design leader in the [[North America]]n market, a title that was attributed to the [[Chrysler Corporation]].&lt;ref name="CG encyclopedia" /&gt; Among the most controversial features of the design were both the front fascia that was composed of separate circular [[headlight]]s, circular turn signals and the oval shaped rear window (the Sable, unlike the Taurus, had a more conventional window).&lt;ref name="CG encyclopedia" /&gt;

This generation of Taurus was released for sale in late 1995 to mixed reactions from consumers.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; It managed to retain its status as the best selling car in America through the 1996 model year; however, this was achieved through heavy sales to [[car rental]] companies: only 49% of Taurus sales in 1996 were to private customers.&lt;ref name="CG encyclopedia" /&gt; Because of this, the Taurus lost its bestseller status in 1997 to the [[Toyota Camry (XV20)|Toyota Camry]].&lt;ref name="det" /&gt; It was replaced by the more conservatively styled [[Ford Taurus (fourth generation)|fourth-generation Ford Taurus]] in 1999.

==Third generation development==
Development for the third-generation Taurus began in 1991, and its designers and engineers believed that they were faced with a daunting task; they compared completely redesigning the Taurus to repainting the [[Mona Lisa]].&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt; Like the first-generation Taurus, the new Taurus was developed by a team effort, in which the exterior and interior designers, engineers, and marketing staff had input on the new car.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;

Many designs were considered during the development process, from designs that resembled the second generation cars, to more radically styled cars. They eventually decided on a radical new styling scheme based upon oval derived design elements, which would prove to be the car's [[Achilles heel]] in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; Chief designer Jack Telnack, who oversaw the development of the first and second generation Taurus, said that his Taurus was designed the way it was to stand out in the marketplace, and that the use of the oval was becoming the new global design theme for Ford.&lt;ref name="News96" /&gt;

Breaking down and testing competing cars, as well as listening to customer input played a large part in the development of the third-generation Taurus, just like it did during the development of the first generation. Many competing cars were broken down and extensively tested in order for the Taurus to be designed to be superior to them in terms of comfort, performance, and refinement.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; Most notably, the [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Honda Accord]] were extensively tested, and the Taurus' suspension was designed to emulate these cars' ride and handling techniques.&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt; Customer input played a large part into the design of the third generation Taurus' interior.

The [[dashboard]]'s design originated from a large number of complaints from customers that the previous Taurus' [[radio]] and [[climate control]] modules were cluttered with many small and similar feeling buttons, as well as small graphics, which caused the driver to have to look away from the road to be able to operate them properly.&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt; As a result, a large portion of the third generation's dash was devoted to the radio and climate control, with each button on these modules containing a unique design, making it easier for the driver to operate the radio and climate control without taking their eyes off the road. This would eventually lead to the creation of the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)#Interior|Integrated Control Panel]].&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt;

Making the new Taurus pleasing to the senses was a recurring theme throughout the third-generation Taurus' development.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt; Ford's engineers specially tuned every panel and component, so that every sound that the Taurus made, from the doors closing to the engine running, was acoustically pleasing.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ovaly" /&gt; Ford's trim designers specially selected every one of the Taurus' interior materials, so that every surface, as well as every button and control, was pleasing to the touch.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;

===Reception===
[[File:3rd Ford Taurus sedan rear.jpg|thumb|Controversial oval rear window]]

The third-generation Taurus and Sable sedans were unveiled at the [[Cobo Center]] during the 1995 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], and garnered more attention from journalists and publications than any other car at the show.&lt;ref name="FREEP" /&gt; The wagon was unveiled on February 9, 1995 at the [[Chicago Auto Show]], and garnered similar amounts of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | date = 1995-02-09 | publisher = PR newswire | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16437531.html | title = 1996 Ford Taurus and Mercury wagons debut in Chicago.| accessdate = 2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their respective unveilings, both vehicles became among the most anticipated new cars of the 1996 model year,&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; similar to the first generation Taurus.

The first third-generation Taurus rolled off the assembly line on July 12, 1995 at the [[Chicago Assembly]] Plant. Ford Chairman [[Alexander Trotman]], who took part in the ceremonies, was joined by state and local politicians and union and plant officials in dipping their hands in yellow paint to "autograph" the hood of the first Taurus off the line. The hood is earmarked for permanent display at the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/20716434.html?dids=20716434:20716434&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jul+24,+1995&amp;author=Jim+Mateja,+Auto+Writer.&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc='96+TAURUS+ANOTHER+FORD+BULL'S-EYE%3F&amp;pqatl=google | work=Chicago Tribune | title='96 Taurus Another Ford Bull's-Eye? | first=Jim | last=Mateja | date=1995-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taurus was released to showrooms on September 24 of that year, and sales began a week later on October 1.&lt;ref name="newsbank 1" /&gt; The Taurus was released almost a week later than the Sable, as Ford designers consulted a $500 [[Sherman Oaks, California]] astrologer to figure out the best solstice date to release the car.&lt;ref name="pqasb.pqarchiver.com" /&gt;

Reception to the new Taurus by automotive publications was generally positive. [[Road &amp; Track]] gave the Taurus a good review upon its release, and found its handling and refinement impressive.&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt; [[Motor Trend]] also gave the Taurus a positive review, although they found the oval styling awkward at first glance. Despite this, they found it to have many redeeming qualities.&lt;ref name="ovaly" /&gt; However, unlike the first-generation Taurus, it fell short of their [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year award]], which was instead awarded to the redesigned 1996 [[Chrysler minivans (NS)|Dodge Caravan]].

Consumer reaction was mixed, however. Detractors of the new design pejoratively refer to this generation as the "Bubble" Taurus or "Submarine" Taurus based on the window shaping and broad curves used in the front end being seen as a negative. Ford had hoped the radical redesign would lead to the same success it had with the 1986 Taurus, and went as far as predicting that the new Taurus would continue the outgoing model's record of selling over 400,000 units a year.&lt;ref name="ovaly" /&gt; Sales were somewhat slow at first, prompting Ford to add a low priced "G" model mid-year 1996.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt; Ford also offered incentives such as a six-month lease for [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Honda Accord]] owners, a $250 Cash Allowance on lease renewals, and a $50 dinner certificate for test driving the vehicle.&lt;ref name="pqasb.pqarchiver.com"/&gt; It managed to keep its position as the best selling car in the United States in 1996, although this was because of heavy sales to rental fleets, which comprised 51% of all Taurus sales for that year.&lt;ref name="CG encyclopedia"  /&gt; This is opposed to the [[Toyota Camry]], of which its largest amount of sales were through [[Car dealership|retail outlets]] to individual customers.&lt;ref name="CG encyclopedia" /&gt; In 1997, the Taurus lost its bestselling title, as it slipped to #3 behind a redesigned Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt; 
==Overview==

===Exterior===
The exterior of the third-generation Taurus was completely redesigned for 1996. It used a controversial new shape that chief designer [[Jack Telnack]] claimed was penned to make the Taurus stand out to sedan buyers, and compared the current Taurus to the likeness of a pair of [[slipper]]s.&lt;ref name="News96" /&gt; This shape was based upon that of an [[oval]], which was perhaps inspired by that of Ford's own logo,&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; and while the previous Taurus used a flat, streamlined shape, this Taurus used a rounded shape similar to that of the [[Chrysler Concorde]]. The heavily-contoured sides took their cue from the [[Lincoln Mark VIII]]. Station wagons also got new sheet metal, although from the firewall back, the Taurus and Mercury Sable wagons again shared the same panels, with all station wagon doors being the same as those used on the Sable sedans. As the new-generation Taurus was aimed at a more mature, affluent customer base,&lt;ref name="News96" /&gt; its exterior contained many upscale styling touches. For example, the LX came with chrome alloy wheels, chrome dual exhaust tips, and the "Taurus" badge on the back was written in script, as opposed to the block letters used in previous generations.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt;
[[File:98-99 Ford Taurus Sedan.jpg|thumb|1998–1999 Taurus sedan]]

In 1998, the exterior of the Taurus received a slight redesign to make the shape more mainstream, in order to appeal to a wider customer base. The front [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] was redesigned to have a full-length opening, as well as moving the Ford logo down onto a chrome bar mounted in the grille, similar to that of the third-generation [[Ford Taurus SHO|Taurus SHO]]. These years were also fitted with different front turn signal lenses, featuring completely clear lenses and a multi-reflector surface in the rear of the housing, around the bulb. The rear turn signal lenses were also changed from amber to red, to match the rest of the lightbar assembly.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Consumerguide96" /&gt;

===Interior===
The interior was also completely redesigned for the 1996 model year. Like that of the previous two generations, the interior was designed to be user-friendly.&lt;ref name="MW" /&gt; The gauges were placed in an oval pod&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curbsideclassic.com/blog/curbside-analysis-1996-ford-taurus-misguided-styling-creates-the-biggest-automotive-fumble-of-the-modern-era/&lt;/ref&gt; while the dashboard wrapped slightly around the driver; all of the main controls were placed within easy reach, and were designed to be recognizable by touch and to be operated by drivers without taking their eyes off the road. The controls for the [[radio]] and [[climate control]](some of which, like the preset buttons, were oval shaped&lt;ref&gt;https://www.drivechicago.com/reviews/1996-ford-taurus-dold-new-direction_43&lt;/ref&gt;) were combined into an oval-shaped "Integrated Control Panel" mounted in the center of the dash, which was created in response to many complaints from Taurus owners that they couldn't easily operate the main controls of the radios and climate control systems without taking their eyes off the road.&lt;ref name="Tribune" /&gt; Gone was wide and couch-like front row bench seating of previous generations.

Another innovation was the "Flip-Fold" center console on cars not equipped with a standard floor console.  It was a seat in between the bucket seats that could be transformed into a console, reducing the seating count by one.  The seat cushion folded out into a console with a lockable storage bin and [[cupholder]]s, resting against the dashboard.  The seatback also folded down to become an armrest.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt; A traditional center console with a floor-mounted shifter was installed on cars equipped without the flip fold console.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt;

This generation's interior wasn't as configurable as that of the first two generations. The G and GL models (see below) were only available with [[steering column]]-mounted shifter, along with a cloth front bench seat and the "Flip-Fold" center console. The LX, on the other hand, came standard with bucket seats that could be ordered with either cloth or [[leather]] upholstery, along with a center console and floor-mounted shifter. However, a column-mounted shifter and a cloth front bench was available as a no-cost option.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt; In 1999, the interior was again available in three configurations, like that of the first-generation Taurus; a front bench seat with a column-mounted shifter, front bucket seats with a center console and floor-mounted shifter, or front bucket seats with a center console and a column-mounted shifter. Each configuration was offered in both Taurus models (see below).&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt;

The Ford Taurus has many seating options, ranging from 5 people to 8 people.  On wagons and sedans equipped with the floor mounted shifter, it seated 5 people standard, and wagons could seat up to 7 people, with a bench in the third row.  Also, models equipped with the flip fold console could seat either 6 or 8 people, depending on whether the wagons had a third row bench or not.  The sedans could seat a maximum of 6 people with the flip fold console, and 5 people with a regular console.

At its launch, the Taurus was available in two models, the GL, which was the entry level/value model, and the LX, which was the top of the line model.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt; The GL was basic, and didn't have many optional features, while the LX came with many standard features and was highly configurable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Options/1996T.html |title=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia (1996 options) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2008-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119015136/http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Options/1996T.html |archivedate=November 19, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To close the price gap between the Taurus and the [[Ford Contour]], as well as to increase sales, an entry-level G model was added midway into the 1996 model year, as essentially a slightly de-contented GL.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt; For the 1998 model year, the models of Taurus were completely changed. The G and GL were dropped, and the LX became the entry-level/value model. The SE model from 1995 was revived, and it became the top-tier model. The SE was offered with two special packages; the Comfort package which added chrome wheels carried over from the LX, automatic climate control, the [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec engine]] [[V6]] (see below), and bucket seats with a center console and a floor-mounted shifter, or the Sport package, which contained all of the features in the comfort package, but substituted the chrome wheels for 5-spoke alloy wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Options/1998T.html |title=Taurus/Sable Encyclopedia (1998 options) |publisher=Taurus Car Club of America |date= |accessdate=2008-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201113509/http://www.taurusclub.com/encyclopedia/Options/1998T.html |archivedate=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 model year was the first time that the Taurus did not have an optional engine. The base G and GL had the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[Ford Vulcan V6 engine|Vulcan]] [[V6 engine|V6]], which was a carryover from the previous model. The top of the line LX, however, got the new 3.0&amp;nbsp;L [[double overhead cam|DOHC]] [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec 30|Duratec 30]] V6, which produced {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and was developed specifically for this model. When Ford rearranged the Taurus models for 1998, the Vulcan became the standard engine, and the Duratec became optional on all models. However, it was only available on the SE for 1999.&lt;ref name="Gen III"/&gt; Vulcan-equipped models came with the 4-speed [[Ford AXOD transmission#AX4S|AX4S]] [[automatic transmission]], while Duratec equipped models got the 4-speed [[Ford AXOD transmission|AX4N]] transmission. However, some Vulcan-equipped models randomly received the AX4N transmission for no apparent reason. Ford also deleted some features for the 1999 model year, in order to lower the price about one thousand dollars, and possibly boost sales. Some deleted features included the floor courtesy lamps and glove compartment lamp.&lt;ref name="trans" /&gt;

==Variants==

===Mercury Sable===

[[File:3rd sable rear.JPG|thumb|Third-generation Mercury Sable]]
The Mercury Sable, a sister model of the Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also redesigned for the 1996 model year. As with previous generations, the Sable used the same mechanical parts as the Taurus with a unique body. However, the 1996 Sable ditched the unique styling cues of the previous generations, specifically the front light bar, wrap-around rear glass and skirted rear fender, in favor of a design theme that more closely resembled that of the Taurus.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt; For the first time, the Sable didn't get a unique interior design, instead sharing all of its interior components with the Taurus with the exception of branded parts and unique woodgrain trim. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation: A base model GS and high-end LS, with a base G model briefly offered during the second half of the 1996 model year.&lt;ref name="Gen III" /&gt; The Sable had the same powertrains and most features as the Taurus, though no counterpart to the high performance SHO was offered. Prices increased, corresponding with the increase in price of the Taurus. While the design of the Taurus was polarizing, the more conservative design of the Sable was praised; [[Automobile Magazine]] selected the Sable as its 1996 design of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jhS24d5V92MC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Automobile+MAgazine+design+of+the+year+Mercury+Sable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TnLgfhMrKE&amp;sig=QqWjB6khGC0wMrlBlt1vWnf1wIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMpt2L24HSAhVh4YMKHY45A7IQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Automobile%20MAgazine%20design%20of%20the%20year%20Mercury%20Sable&amp;f=false 1996 Sable advertisement]&lt;/ref&gt;Unlike the Taurus, sales of the Sable stayed steady with the previous model, and styling revisions for 1998 were limited to a new grille and headlamps. The Taurus and Sable were produced concurrently through the 1999 model year.

===Ford Taurus SHO===
{{main|Ford Taurus SHO}}
[[File:1996-1999 Ford Taurus SHO front.jpg|thumb|Third-generation Ford Taurus SHO]]

As with the Taurus, a new model of Taurus SHO was launched for 1996. Although it contained less aggressive styling than its predecessors, it still differed from the normal Taurus with different seats, [[wheel]]s, [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]], drivetrain, as well as a fin being put on the driver's side [[windshield wiper]], to keep it on the [[windshield]] at high speeds.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; A {{convert|235|hp|kW|abbr=on}} aluminum 3.4&amp;nbsp;L [[V8 engine]] with heads from [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and block from [[Cosworth]] was specified for the SHO model, but it was given the same 4-speed transmission as the LX: the manual gearbox option was no longer offered on the SHO.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt; This was partly because this model of SHO was designed for comfort instead of performance.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt;

This model of SHO gained a reputation of being trouble-prone due to a large number of engine failures at around the 50,000-mile mark due to separation of the [[camshaft]] from its sprocket.&lt;ref name="V8" /&gt; However, this problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded.&lt;ref name="V8" /&gt; Possibly because of this, this generation of SHO sold substantially worse than its predecessor, with sales peaking at 9,000 in 1997.&lt;ref name="numbers" /&gt; As a result, the SHO was discontinued outright after the 1999 model year.

===Export Models===
[[File:1996 Ford Taurus (DP) Ghia sedan (2010-07-05) 01.jpg|thumb|1996–1998 Ford Taurus Ghia sedan (Australia)]]

In addition to being sold in the [[North American]] market, third-generation models were exported to many other countries, in [[Driving on the left or right|left and right-hand drive]] configurations. However, this action proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="AU" /&gt; Export models wore Mercury Sable [[headlamp]]s and a unique front bumper cover to conform to these countries' regulations regarding [[automotive lighting]]. Right-hand-drive versions used a [[parking brake|hand-operated parking brake]] in the center console instead of a foot-operated parking brake as in North America. Australians tended to stay away from the Taurus, due to their high price; a well-equipped, larger-engined [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Ford EL Falcon|Ford Fairmont]] cost around the same amount.&lt;ref name="AU"/&gt; Australian buyers could only opt for a single-spec sedan, known as the ''Taurus Ghia''.&lt;ref name="AU"/&gt; However, in New Zealand the Taurus was quite popular. While Australia only saw the 1996 model, both the sedan and station wagon models were sold in New Zealand from 1996 to 1998. 

Launched while Japan was in a [[Lost Decade (Japan)|recession]] following the 1991 collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]], this generation Taurus was exported to Japan in limited numbers, and sold at Japanese auto dealerships called [[Ford Motor Company#Ford of Japan|Autorama]] (a joint venture with [[Mazda]]), where the sedan and wagon versions with right-hand driving positions until 1997. To Japanese buyers, it was regarded as a luxury vehicle as the exterior dimensions and engine displacement exceeded Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|regulations]], and buyers in Japan were liable for additional taxes. The engine displacement also put operating costs for Japanese owners in a higher [[Road tax#Japan|annual road tax]] obligation.

==Replacement==
{{main|Ford Taurus (fourth generation)}}
[[File:00-03 Ford Taurus SES sedan.jpg|thumb|left|Fourth-generation Ford Taurus]]
[[File:04Taurus.jpg|thumb|right|Fourth-generation Ford Taurus]]
In 1999, Ford launched the fourth-generation Ford Taurus to replace the third generation. Although the doors and mechanical parts were carried over, this generation was designed with a more conservative design in hopes of increasing its appeal to customers.&lt;ref name="CG encyclopedia" /&gt; This new shape contained a more upright trunk and rear roof panel, of which increased headroom and trunk space substantially.&lt;ref name="Consumerguide00" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G4" /&gt; This generation also contained a redesigned interior that sported a more conservative look, while retaining many features offered in the third generation.&lt;ref name="G4" /&gt;

However, this model of Taurus is most notable for offering a special system that Ford called the "Personal Safety System". This system had sensors in the seat that detected a passenger's weight and position, and inflated the [[airbag]]s to match.&lt;ref name="bestselling" /&gt; This generation of Taurus was sold from 1999 through the beginning of the 2007 model year, in which it was discontinued with the entire Taurus nameplate.&lt;ref name="det" /&gt; However, the Taurus nameplate would later be revived in a matter of months due to the insistence of then-new Ford [[Chief Operating Officer|CEO]] [[Alan Mulally]].&lt;ref name="Alan" /&gt;

The '''Full City Oil Spill''' is a major fuel oil spill incident that occurred on July 31, 2009 when the [[bulk carrier]] [[Full City]] [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] on the island of [[Såstein]] / Saastein south of [[Langesund]], [[Telemark]], [[Norway]]. The ship, said to be operated by [[COSCO|COSCO (H.K.) Shipping Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2108">'''Microsoft Hohm''' was an online [[web application]] by [[Microsoft]] that enables consumers to analyze their energy usage and provides energy saving recommendations.

Announced on June 24, 2009, Microsoft Hohm was built on the [[Windows Azure]] cloud operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10271885-56.html|title=Mundie on Microsoft's 'Hohm' energy push|date=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft licensed the [[Home Energy Saver]] energy simulation program developed at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] to drive Microsoft Hohm. It was publicly released on July 6, 2009.

[[Home Energy Saver]] and Hohm received an [[R&amp;D 100 Award]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the R&amp;D 100 Winners for 2010|url=http://www.rdmag.com/Awards/RD-100-Awards/2010/07/R-D-100-2010-Winners-Overview/|publisher=R&amp;D Magazine|accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hohm service was discontinued on May 31, 2012 due to a lack of consumer uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Hohm Service Discontinuation|url=http://blog.microsoft-hohm.com/news/11-06-30/Microsoft_Hohm_Service_Discontinuation.aspx|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydnocarpic acid''' is an [[unsaturated fatty acid]].  It differs from most fatty acids by having a [[Cyclic compound|cyclic ring system]] at the terminus, rather than being entirely straight chain.  It is found in the oil from plants of the genus ''[[Hydnocarpus]]'' from which it derives its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jsfa.2740240606 | title = The component fatty acids of chaulmoogra oil | year = 1973 | last1 = Sengupta | first1 = A. | last2 = Gupta | first2 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12028">The '''impulse excitation technique''' ('''IET''') is a non-destructive material characterization technique to determine the elastic properties and internal friction of a material of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1997-12-01|title=Impulse excitation apparatus to measure resonant frequencies, elastic moduli, and internal friction at room and high temperature|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.1148422|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=68|issue=12|pages=4511–4515|doi=10.1063/1.1148422|issn=0034-6748}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures the [[Fundamental frequency|resonant frequencies]] in order to calculate the [[Young's modulus]], [[shear modulus]], [[Poisson's ratio]] and [[Friction|internal friction]] of predefined shapes like rectangular bars, cylindrical rods and disc shaped samples. The measurements can be performed at room temperature or at elevated temperatures (up to 1700&amp;nbsp;°C) under different atmospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roebben|first=G|last2=Basu|first2=B|last3=Vleugels|first3=J|last4=Van Humbeeck|first4=J|last5=Van der Biest|first5=O|date=2000-09-28|title=The innovative impulse excitation technique for high-temperature mechanical spectroscopy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092583880000966X|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|series=Intern.

The measurement principle is based on tapping the sample with a small projectile and recording the induced vibration signal with a [[piezoelectric sensor]], [[microphone]], [[Laser Doppler vibrometer|laser vibrometer]] or [[accelerometer]]. To optimize the results a microphone or a laser vibrometer can be used as there is no contact between the test-piece and the sensor.  Laser vibrometers are preferred to measure signals in vacuum. Afterwards, the acquired vibration signal in the time domain is converted to the frequency domain by a [[fast Fourier transform]]ation. Dedicated software will determine the resonant frequency with high accuracy to calculate the elastic properties based on the [[Euler–Bernoulli beam theory|classical beam theory]].

==Elastic properties==
Different resonant frequencies can be excited dependent on the position of the support wires, the mechanical impulse and the microphone. The two most important resonant frequencies are the flexural which is controlled by the Young's modulus of the sample and the torsional which is controlled by the shear modulus for isotropic materials.

For predefined shapes like rectangular bars, discs, rods and grinding wheels, dedicated software calculates the sample's elastic properties using the sample dimensions, weight and resonant frequency (ASTM E1876-15).[[Image:Mechanic excitation flexure.JPG|thumb|left|310px|Test-piece vibrating in [[flexure]] mode]]

===Flexure mode===
The first figure gives an example of a test-piece vibrating in the [[flexure]]
mode. This induced vibration is also referred as the out-of-plane vibration mode. The in-plane vibration will be excited by turning the sample 90° on the axis parallel to its length. The [[natural frequency]] of this flexural vibration mode is characteristic for the dynamic [[Young's modulus]].
To minimize the damping of the test-piece, it has to be supported at the nodes where the vibration amplitude is zero. The test-piece is mechanically excited at one of the anti-nodes to cause maximum vibration.

[[Image:Mechanic excitation torsion.JPG|thumb|left|310px|Test-piece vibrating in the [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] mode]]

===Torsion mode===
The second figure gives an example of a test-piece vibrating in the [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] mode. The [[natural frequency]] of this vibration is characteristic for the [[shear modulus]]. 
To minimize the damping of the test-piece, it has to be supported at the center of both axis. The mechanical excitation has to be performed in one corner in order to twist the beam rather than flexing it.

=== Poisson's ratio ===
The [[Poisson's ratio]] is a measure in which a material tends to expand in directions perpendicular to the direction of compression. After measuring the Young's modulus and the shear modulus, dedicated software determines the Poisson's ratio using [[Hooke's law]] which can only be applied to [[Isotropy|isotropic]] materials according to the different standards.

=== Internal friction / Damping ===
Material damping or internal friction is characterized by the decay of the vibration amplitude of the sample in free vibration as the logarithmic decrement. The damping behaviour originates from anelastic processes occurring in a strained solid i.e. thermoelastic damping, magnetic damping, viscous damping, defect damping, ... For example, different materials defects ([[dislocation]]s, vacancies, ...) can contribute to an increase in the internal friction between the vibrating defects and the neighboring regions.

=== Dynamic vs. static methods ===
Considering the importance of elastic properties for design and engineering applications, a number of experimental techniques are developed and these can be classified into 2 groups; static and dynamic methods. Statics methods (like the [[Four point flexural test|four-point bending test]] and [[nanoindentation]]) are based on direct measurements of stresses and strains during mechanical tests. Dynamic methods (like [[ultrasound spectroscopy]] and impulse excitation technique) provide an advantage over static methods because the measurements are relatively quick and simple and involve small elastic strains. Therefore, IET is very suitable for porous and brittle materials like [[Ceramic engineering|ceramics]], [[Refractory|refractories]],… The technique can also be easily modified for high temperature experiments and only a small amount of material needs to be available.

== Accuracy and uncertainty ==
The most important parameters to define the measurement uncertainty are the mass and dimensions of the sample. Therefore, each parameter has to be measured (and prepared) to a level of accuracy of 0.1%. Especially, the sample thickness is most critical (third power in the equation for Young's modulus). In that case, an overall accuracy of 1% can be obtained practically in most applications.

==Applications==
The impulse excitation technique can be used in a wide range of applications. Nowadays, IET equipment can perform measurements between −50&amp;nbsp;°C and 1700&amp;nbsp;°C in different atmospheres (air, inert, vacuum). IET is mostly used in research and as [[quality control]] tool to study the transitions as function of time and temperature.
A detailed insight into the material crystal structure can be obtained by studying the elastic and damping properties. For example, the interaction of dislocations and point defects in carbon steels are studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jung|first=Il-Chan|last2=Kang|first2=Deok-Gu|last3=Cooman|first3=Bruno C. De|date=2013-11-26|title=Impulse Excitation Internal Friction Study of Dislocation and Point Defect Interactions in Ultra-Low Carbon Bake-Hardenable Steel|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-013-2122-z|journal=Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A|language=en|volume=45|issue=4|pages=1962–1978|doi=10.1007/s11661-013-2122-z|issn=1073-5623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the material damage accumulated during a thermal shock treatment can be determined for refractory materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Germany|first=GHI/RWTH-Aachen, Aachen, Germany, Institute of Mineral Engineering – Department of Ceramics and Refractory Materials, Aachen,|date=2015-01-01|title=Estimation of Damage in Refractory Materials after Progressive Thermal Shocks with Resonant Frequency Damping Analysis|url=http://www.ceramic-science.com/journal/article.php?doi=10.4416/JCST2015-00080|journal=Journal of Ceramic Science and Technology|language=en-gb|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.4416/jcst2015-00080}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be an advantage in understanding the physical properties of certain materials.
Finally, the technique can be used to check the quality of systems. In this case, a reference piece is required to obtain a reference frequency spectrum. Engine blocks for example can be tested by tapping them and comparing the recorded signal with a pre-recorded signal of a reference engine block.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2206">'''Kingsbury Colliery''' was a [[coal mine]] in [[Kingsbury, Warwickshire|Kingsbury]], [[Warwickshire]], which operated between 1897 and 1968.

==History==
It was opened in 1897 and changed the nature of the village almost overnight from a predominantly agriculturally based community to a mining village, and helped Kingsbury's expansion. Coal extracted from Kingsbury Colliery was used mainly for industry in nearby [[Birmingham]], although the Lurghi Gas Plant at [[Coleshill, Warwickshire|Coleshill]] was also a major customer. 

The colliery operated throughout the first half of the 20th century, and in 1904 the village of [[Piccadilly, Warwickshire|Piccadilly]] was built close by to house some of the mine's workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.piccadilly-heritage.co.uk/|title= Piccadilly Mining Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the pit's closure in 1968, some of the land was used for the construction of the [[Kingsbury Oil Terminal]].

In 2009 a memorial wall was built in Piccadilly to remember those who worked in both Kingsbury Colliery, and the neighbouring [[Dexter Colliery]]. The wall contains the names of all the miners who worked at both mines. The centrepiece of the wall is a [[Davy lamp|miner's lamp]] that is always lit to commemorate those who have died and those who remember working down the mines.

==Notable employees==
Notable people who have worked at the colliery include the footballer [[Sid Ireland]].&lt;ref name = "ABC"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Alphabet of the Saints|last= Holley |first= Duncan |last2= Chalk|first2= Gary| publisher= ACL &amp; Polar Publishing | year=1992| isbn=0-9514862-3-3 |page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kraft.jpg|thumb|A piece of kraft paper]]
'''Kraft paper''' or '''kraft''' &lt;ref&gt;Derived from German ''Kraft'',[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kraft] meaning "strength" in this context, due to the strength of the paper produced using this process.&lt;/ref&gt; is [[paper]] or [[paperboard]] (cardboard) produced from [[chemical pulp]] produced in the [[kraft process]].

''Sack kraft paper'', or just ''sack paper'', is a porous kraft paper with high [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and high tear resistance, designed for packaging products with high demands for strength and durability.&lt;ref name=sack&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |year= 2000|origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=121–122 |chapter= 5|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulp produced by the kraft process is stronger than that made by other [[wood pulp#Manufacture of wood pulp|pulping processes]]; acidic [[sulfite process]]es degrade [[cellulose]] more, leading to weaker fibers, and mechanical pulping processes leave most of the [[lignin]] with the fibers, whereas kraft pulping removes most of the lignin present originally in the wood. Low lignin is important to the resulting strength of the paper, as the [[hydrophobic]] nature of lignin interferes with the formation of the [[hydrogen bonds]] between cellulose (and [[hemicellulose]]) in the fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubbe |first=Martin A. |authorlink=|first2=Lucian A. |last2=Lucia  |year=2007 |title=The "Love-Hate" Relationship Present in Lignocellulosic Materials |journal=BioResources |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=534–535 |id= |url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/BioRes_2_4_534_535_Hubbe_Lucia_Love_and_Hate_Lignocellulosics |accessdate= 2015-02-02 |quote=|format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraft pulp is darker than other wood pulps, but it can be [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] to make very white pulp. Fully bleached kraft pulp is used to make high quality paper where strength, whiteness, and resistance to yellowing are important.

==Manufacture==
{{Main|Kraft process|Paper machine}}
[[Wood pulp]] for sack paper is made from [[softwood]] by the [[kraft process]]. The long fibers provide the paper its strength and  [[wet strength|wet strength chemicals]] are added to even further improve the strength. Both white and brown grades are made. Sack paper is then produced on a [[paper machine]] from the wood pulp. The paper is [[Crêpe paper|microcrepped]] to give porosity and elasticity. Microcrepping is done by drying with loose draws allowing it to shrink. This causes the paper to elongate 4% in the machine direction and 10% in the cross direction without breaking.&lt;ref name=sack/&gt; Machine direction elongation can be further improved by pressing between very elastic cylinders causing more microcrepping.&lt;ref name=sack/&gt; The paper may be coated with [[polyethylene]] (PE) to ensure an effective barrier against [[moisture]], [[petroleum|grease]] and [[bacteria]]. A paper sack can be made of several layers of sack paper depending on the toughness needed.

Kraft paper is produced on paper machines with moderate machine speeds. The raw material is normally [[softwood]] pulp from the kraft process.

Maintaining a high effective sulfur ratio or sulfidity is important for the highest possible strength using the kraft process.

The kraft process can use a wider range of fiber sources than most other pulping processes. All types of wood, including very resinous types like southern [[pine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/usda/amwood/256spine.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Southern Pines |accessdate=2007-09-13 |author= |year=1985 |work= |publisher=US Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-wood species like [[bamboo]] and [[kenaf]] can be used in the kraft process.

==Qualities==
* Normal kraft paper is strong and relatively coarse. It has high [[tensile strength]]. The [[grammage]] is normally 40–135 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Sack kraft paper, or just sack paper, is a porous kraft paper with high elasticity and high tear resistance, designed for packaging products with high demands for strength and durability.
* Absorbent kraft paper is made with controlled absorbency, i.e., a high degree of porosity. It is made of clean low [[kappa number|kappa]] [[hardwood]] kraft and has to have a good uniformity and formation.
* Spinning kraft paper is an especially strong type of kraft paper with relatively low grammage (40 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This paper requires the best possible machine direction strength and cross machine elongation. This is done by high fiber orientation on the papermachine.
* Hunting cartridge paper is a kraft paper used in [[shotgun shell]]s. This paper needs a high tensile strength in the machine direction, which is the axial direction of the cartridges. In the cross direction, the cartridge is supported by the gun-pipe, but a sufficient elongation is needed. The body of the cartridge is wound of a kraft paper of 80–120 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is further covered by an outer sheet of 60–80 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with colour and printing.
* Candy wrapping paper and twisting paper are thin 30–40 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; kraft papers and are mostly [[flexo]] or [[Offset printing|offset printed]]. These papers require a good strength, with highly oriented fibers. Twisting paper is mostly opaque and often [[supercalendered]].

==Applications==
{{Main|Paper bag|Paper sack}}
* As a plastic hazard free paper in [[paper sack]]s for cement, food, chemicals, consumer goods, flour bags etc.
* Electrical insulation in large oil-filled [[transformer]]s.
* [[paper bag|Paper grocery bags]], [[paper sack|multiwall sacks]], [[envelopes]] and other packaging.
* An inexpensive material for lining [[particle board]]s.
* The base paper for [[sandpaper]].
* As wrapping for [[Flower bouquet|flower bouquets]].
* In [[World War II]], for fabricating [[drop tank]]s.

'''Lyonesse''' is a country in [[Arthurian legend]], particularly in the story of [[Tristan and Iseult]]. Said to border [[Cornwall]], it is most notable as the home of the hero [[Tristan]], whose father was king. In later traditions Lyonesse is said to have sunk beneath the waves some time after the Tristan stories take place, making it similar to [[Ys]] and other [[lost lands]] in medieval [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] tales, and perhaps connecting it with the [[Isles of Scilly]].

==Lyonesse in Arthurian legend==
In medieval Arthurian legend, there are no references to the sinking of Lyonesse, because the name originally referred to a still-existing place. Lyonesse is an English alteration of French ''Léoneis'' or ''Léonois'' (earlier ''Loönois''), a development of ''Lodonesia'', the Latin name for [[Lothian]] in Scotland. Continental writers of Arthurian romances were often puzzled by the internal geography of Great Britain; thus it is that the author French [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']] appears to place Léonois contiguous, by land, to [[Cornwall]]. 

In English adaptations of the French tales, Léonois, now "Lyonesse", becomes a kingdom wholly distinct from Lothian, and closely associated with the Cornish region, though its exact geographical location remained unspecified. The name was not attached to Cornish legends of lost coastal lands until the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]], however.&lt;ref name="Bivar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bivar |first=A. D. H. |date=February 1953 |title=Lyonnesse: The Evolution of a Fable |journal=Modern Philology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=162–170 |doi=10.1086/388954}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legendary lost land between Land's End and Scilly has a distinct Cornish name: ''Lethowsow''. This derives from the Cornish name for the Seven Stones reef, on the reputed site of the lost land's capital and the site of the notorious wreck of the {{SS|Torrey Canyon||2}}. The name means "the milky ones", from the constant white water surrounding the reef.

[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]'s Arthurian epic ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' describes Lyonesse as the site of the final battle between Arthur and [[Mordred]]. One passage in particular references legends of Lyonesse as a land fated to sink beneath the ocean:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Then rose the King and moved his host by night
And ever pushed Sir Mordred, league by league,
Back to the sunset bound of Lyonesse—
A land of old upheaven from the abyss
By fire, to sink into the abyss again;
Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,
And the long mountains ended in a coast
Of ever-shifting sand, and far away
The phantom circle of a moaning sea.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Deriving from a false etymology of Lyonesse, the 'City of Lions' was said in some later traditions to be the capital of the legendary kingdom, situated on what is today the [[Seven Stones Reef]], some eighteen miles west of Land's End and eight miles north-east of the Isles of Scilly.&lt;ref&gt;James, Beryl (1988). ''Tales of the Tinners' Way''. Redruth: Dyllansow Truran. {{ISBN|1-85022-042-5}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogues in Celtic mythology==
The legend of a sunken kingdom appears in both [[Cornish mythology|Cornish]] and [[Breton mythology]]. In Christian times it came to be viewed as a sort of Cornish [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], an example of divine wrath provoked by unvirtuous living.

There is a Breton parallel in the tale of the Cité d'[[Ys]], similarly drowned as a result of its debauchery with a single virtuous survivor escaping on a horse, in this case King [[Gradlon]]. The [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] equivalent to Lyonesse and [[Ys|Ker Ys]] is [[Cantre'r Gwaelod]], a legendary drowned kingdom in [[Cardigan Bay]].

It is often suggested that the tale of Lyonesse represents an extraordinary survival of folk memory of the flooding of the Isles of Scilly and [[Mount's Bay]] near Penzance.&lt;ref name=Hind&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hind |first=C. Lewis. |year=1907 |title=Days in Cornwall |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] name of [[St Michael's Mount]] is ''Karrek Loos y'n Koos'' - literally, "the grey rock in the wood". [[Cornish people]] around Penzance still get occasional glimpses at extreme low water of a sunken forest in Mount's Bay, where petrified tree stumps become visible. The importance of the maintenance of this memory can be seen in that it came to be associated with the legendary [[Brython]] hero Arthur, although the date of its inundation is actually c. 2500 BC.

Small grains of magnetite occur in almost all [[igneous rocks|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks]].  Magnetite is black or brownish-black with a metallic luster, has a [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] of 5–6 and leaves a black [[streak (mineralogy)|streak]].&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt;

The chemical [[IUPAC]] name is [[iron(II,III) oxide]] and the common chemical name is '''ferrous-ferric oxide'''.

==Properties==
In addition to igneous rocks, magnetite also occurs in [[sedimentary rocks]], including [[banded iron formation]]s and in lake and marine sediments as both detrital grains and as [[magnetofossils]]. Magnetite nanoparticles are also thought to form in soils, where they probably oxidize rapidly to [[maghemite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maher | first1 = B.

=== Crystal structure ===
The chemical composition of magnetite is Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. The main details of its structure were established in 1915. It was one of the first crystal structures to be obtained using [[X-ray diffraction]]. The structure is inverse [[spinel group|spinel]], with O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions forming a [[face centered cubic]] lattice and iron cations occupying interstitial sites. Half of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cations occupy tetrahedral sites while the other half, along with Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, occupy octahedral sites. The unit cell consists of 32 O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions and unit cell length is ''a'' = 0.839&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=Schwertmann&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Iron Oxides|last=Cornell|first=|last2=Schwertmann|publisher=VCH|year=1996|isbn=978-3-527-28576-1|location=New York|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetite contains both ferrous and ferric iron, requiring environments containing intermediate levels of oxygen availability to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mineral resources, economics and the environment |last=Kesler |first=Stephen E. |last2=Simon |first2=Adam F. |year=2015 |isbn=9781107074910 |edition=2nd |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |publisher=Cambridge University Press |oclc=907621860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetite differs from most other iron oxides in that it contains both divalent and trivalent iron.&lt;ref name=Schwertmann /&gt;

As a member of the spinel group, magnetite can form [[solid solution]]s with similarly structured minerals, including [[ulvospinel]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hercynite]] (FeAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[chromite]] (FeCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
Titanomagnetite, also known as titaniferous magnetite, is a solid solution between magnetite and ulvospinel that crystallizes in many [[mafic]] igneous rocks. Titanomagnetite may undergo [[oxyexsolution]] during cooling, resulting in ingrowths of magnetite and ilmenite.

=== Crystal morphology and size ===
Natural and synthetic magnetite occurs most commonly as [[Octahedron|octahedral]] crystals bounded by {111} planes and as [[Rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic-dodecahedra]].&lt;ref name=Schwertmann /&gt; Twinning occurs on the {111} plane.

Hydrothermal synthesis usually produce single octahedral crystals which can be as large as 10mm across.&lt;ref name=Schwertmann /&gt; In the presence of mineralizers such as 0.1M HI or 2M [[Ammonium chloride|NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]] and at 0.207 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] at 416-800&amp;nbsp;°C, magnetite grew as crystals whose shapes were a combination of rhombic-dodechahedra forms.&lt;ref name=Schwertmann /&gt; The crystals were more rounded than usual. The appearance of higher forms was considered as a result from a decrease in the surface energies caused by the lower surface to volume ratio in the rounded crystals.&lt;ref name=Schwertmann /&gt;

=== Reactions ===
Magnetite has been important in understanding the conditions under which rocks form. Magnetite reacts with oxygen to produce [[hematite]], and the mineral pair forms a [[mineral redox buffer|buffer]] that can control oxygen [[fugacity]]. Commonly, [[igneous rock]]s contain solid solutions of both titanomagnetite and hemoilmenite or titanohematite. Compositions of the mineral pairs are used to calculate how oxidizing was the [[magma]] (i.e., the [[oxygen]] fugacity of the magma): a range of [[Mineral redox buffer|oxidizing conditions]] are found in magmas and the oxidation state helps to determine how the magmas might evolve by [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|fractional crystallization]]. Magnetite also is produced from [[peridotite]]s and [[dunite]]s by [[serpentinite|serpentinization]].

=== Magnetic properties ===
Lodestones were used as an early form of [[magnetic compass]]. Magnetite typically carries the dominant magnetic signature in rocks, and so it has been a critical tool in [[paleomagnetism]], a science important in understanding [[plate tectonics]] and as historic data for [[magnetohydrodynamics]] and other [[scientific fields]].

The relationships between magnetite and other iron-rich oxide minerals such as [[ilmenite]], hematite, and ulvospinel have been much studied; the [[Metamorphic reaction|reaction]]s between these minerals and [[oxygen]] influence how and when magnetite preserves a record of the [[Earth's magnetic field]].

At low temperatures, magnetite undergoes a crystal structure phase transition from a monoclinic structure to a cubic structure known as the [[Verwey transition]]. Optical studies show that this metal to insulator transition is sharp and occurs around 120 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gasparov, L.

If magnetite is in a large enough quantity it can be found in [[aeromagnetic survey]]s using a [[magnetometer]] which measures magnetic intensities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/education/down_under/exploration/magsurv.html |title=Magnetic Surveys |website=Minerals Downunder |publisher=Australian Mines Atlas |access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution of deposits==
[[File:HeavyMineralsBeachSand.jpg|thumb|Magnetite and other heavy minerals (dark) in a quartz [[beach]] [[sand]] ([[Chennai]], [[India]]).]]
Magnetite is sometimes found in large quantities in beach sand. Such [[black sand]]s (mineral sands or iron sands) are found in various places, such as [[Lung Kwu Tan]] of [[Hong Kong]]; [[California]], [[United States]]; and the west coast of the North Island of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetite, eroded from rocks, is carried to the beach by rivers and concentrated by wave action and currents. Huge deposits have been found in banded iron formations. These sedimentary rocks have been used to infer changes in the oxygen content of the atmosphere of the Earth.&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=C.|title=Some Precambrian banded iron-formations (BIFs) from around the world: Their age, geologic setting, mineralogy, metamorphism, geochemistry, and origins|journal=American Mineralogist|date=1 October 2005|volume=90|issue=10|pages=1473–1499|doi=10.2138/am.2005.1871|bibcode=2005AmMin..90.1473K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Remote sensing]] has the potential to be a big part in locating magnetite sands as even small amounts of magnetite in sand can drastically alter the sands [[albedo]] which is the amount of [[electromagnetic radiation]] the sand will reflect. The darker magnetite will lower the sands albedo compared to sands that do not contain magnetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lERADwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=magnetite+remote+sensing#v=onepage&amp;q=magnetite&amp;f=false|title=Remote Sensing Geology|last=Gupta|first=Ravi P.|date=2017-11-24|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662558768|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large deposits of magnetite are also found in the [[Atacama]] region of [[Chile]]; the [[Valentines]] region of [[Uruguay]]; [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]; the [[Pilbara]], Midwest and Northern Goldfields regions in [[Western Australia]]; the [[Eyre Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]]; the [[Tallawang, New South Wales|Tallawang Region]] of [[New South Wales]]; and in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondack]] region of [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States]]. [[Kediet ej Jill]], the highest mountain of [[Mauritania]], is made entirely of the mineral. Deposits are also found in [[Norway]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mexico]], [[Hong Kong]], and in [[Oregon]], [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[North Carolina]], [[West Virginia]], [[Virginia]], [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], and [[Colorado]] in the [[United States]]. In 2005, an exploration company, Cardero Resources, discovered a vast deposit of magnetite-bearing sand dunes in [[Peru]]. The dune field covers 250 square kilometers (100&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), with the highest dune at over 2,000 meters (6,560&amp;nbsp;ft) above the desert floor. The sand contains 10% magnetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moriarty |first1=Bob |title=Ferrous Nonsnotus |date=5 July 2005 |url=http://www.321gold.com/editorials/moriarty/moriarty070505.html |website=321gold |accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In large enough quantities magnetite can affect [[compass]] [[navigation]]. In [[Tasmania]] there are many areas with highly magnetized rocks that can greatly influence compasses. Extra steps and repeated observations are required when using a compass in Tasmania to keep navigation problems to the minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.utas.edu.au/13644/1/1997_Leaman_Magnetic_rst.pdf|title=Magnetic Rocks - Their Effect on Compass Use and Navigation in Tasmania|last=Leaman|first=David|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electron microscope]] scans of human brain-tissue samples are able to differentiate between magnetite produced by the body's own cells and magnetite absorbed from airborne pollution, the natural forms being jagged and crystalline, while magnetite pollution occurs as rounded [[nanoparticle]]s. Potentially a human health hazard, airborne magnetite is a result of pollution specifically combustion. These nanoparticles can travel to the brain via the olfactory nerve increasing the concentration of magnetite in the brain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In some brain samples, the nanoparticle pollution outnumbers the natural particles by as much as 100:1, and such pollution-borne magnetite particles may be linked to abnormal neural deterioration.

A further eight, aged 62 to 92, came from Manchester, and some had died with varying severities of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37276219 BBC Environment:Pollution particles 'get into brain']&lt;/ref&gt; According to researchers led by Prof. Barbara Maher at Lancaster University and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, such particles could conceivably contribute to diseases like [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Though a causal link has not been established, laboratory studies suggest that iron oxides like magnetite are a component of [[Senile plaques|protein plaques]] in the brain, linked to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Clare|title=Air pollution is sending tiny magnetic particles into your brain|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=5 September 2016 |volume=231 |issue=3090 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2104654-air-pollution-is-sending-tiny-magnetic-particles-into-your-brain/|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased iron levels, specifically magnetic iron, have been found portions of the brain in Alzheimer's patients.&lt;ref name="Qin, Y. 2011"&gt;Qin, Y., Zhu, W., Zhan, C. et al. J. Huazhong Univ. Sci. Technol. [Med. Sci.] (2011) 31: 578.&lt;/ref&gt; Monitoring changes in iron concentrations may make it possible to detect the loss of neurons and the development of neurodegenerative diseases prior to the onset of symptoms&lt;ref name="Zecca2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Qin, Y. 2011"/&gt; due to the relationship between magnetite and ferritin.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In tissue, magnetite and ferritin can produce small magnetic fields which will interact with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) creating contrast.&lt;ref name="Qin, Y. 2011"/&gt; Huntington patients have not shown increased magnetite levels; however, high levels have been found in study mice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Applications==
Due to its high iron content, magnetite has long been a major [[iron ore]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz Oeters et al"Iron" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a14_461.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is reduced in [[blast furnaces]] to [[pig iron]] or [[sponge iron]] for conversion to [[steel]].

===Magnetic recording===
[[Audio recording]] using magnetic acetate tape was developed in the 1930s. The German [[magnetophon]] utilized magnetite powder as the recording medium.&lt;ref name= Schoenherr&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/magnetic4.html | last= Schoenherr | first =Steven | date =2002 |title =The History of Magnetic Recording |publisher= Audio Engineering Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following [[World War II]],  [[3M]] Company continued work on the German design. In 1946, the 3M researchers found they could improve the magnetite-based tape, which utilized powders of cubic crystals, by replacing the magnetite with needle-shaped particles of [[Iron(III) oxide#Gamma phase|gamma ferric oxide]] (γ-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Schoenherr/&gt;

===Catalysis===
Magnetite is the catalyst for the industrial synthesis of [[ammonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Appl "Ammonia, 2. Production Processes" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2011, Wiley-VCH.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.o02_o11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to catalyze the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl free radicals and to decompose organic contaminants such as ''p''-nitrophenol (''p''-NP), which results from chemical processes such as oil refining, petrochemical manufacturing, pulp and paper mills, and the production of many paints, plastics, and pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=HE |first=Hongping |last2=ZHONG |first2=Yuanhong |last3=LIANG |first3=Xiaoliang |last4=TAN |first4=Wei |last5=ZHU |first5=Jianxi |last6=Yan WANG |first6=Christina |date=2015-05-11 |title=Natural Magnetite: an efficient catalyst for the degradation of organic contaminant|journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |pages=10139 |doi=10.1038/srep10139 |issn=2045-2322 |pmc=4426601 |pmid=25958854 |bibcode=2015NatSR...510139H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of such contaminants is an important environmental application.

=== Magnetite nanoparticles ===
Magnetite micro- and nanoparticles are used in a variety of applications, from biomedical to environmental. One use is in water purification: in high gradient magnetic separation, magnetite nanoparticles introduced into contaminated water will bind to the suspended particles (solids, bacteria, or plankton, for example) and settle to the bottom of the fluid, allowing the contaminants to be removed and the magnetite particles to be recycled and reused.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blaney |first=Lee |date=2007 |title=Magnetite (Fe3O4): Properties, Synthesis, and Applications |url=https://preserve.lehigh.edu/cas-lehighreview-vol-15/5/ |journal=The Lehigh Review |volume=15 |issue=5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method works with radioactive and carcinogenic particles as well, making it an important cleanup tool in the case of heavy metals introduced into water systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/waste-water-treatment-technologies-and-recent-analytical-developments/applications-of-magnetite-nanoparticles-for-heavy-metal-removal-from-wastewater|last=Carlos|first=Luciano|last2=Einschlag|first2=Fernando S.

Being able to remove contaminants from potential drinking water for citizens is an important application, as it greatly reduces the health risks associated with drinking contaminated water.

Another application of magnetic nanoparticles is in the creation of [[ferrofluid]]s. These are used in several ways, in addition to being fun to play with. Ferrofluids can be used for targeted drug delivery in the human body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The magnetization of the particles bound with drug molecules allows “magnetic dragging” of the solution to the desired area of the body. This would allow the treatment of only a small area of the body, rather than the body as a whole, and could be highly useful in cancer treatment, among other things. Ferrofluids are also used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen|first=Zachary R.|last2=Kievit|first2=Forrest M.|last3=Zhang|first3=Miqin|title=Magnetite nanoparticles for medical MR imaging|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369702111701638|journal=Materials Today|language=en|volume=14|issue=7–8|pages=330–338|doi=10.1016/s1369-7021(11)70163-8|pmid=22389583|pmc=3290401|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matthew L. Scullin''' is a San Francisco-based scientist, energy entrepreneur, and musician.

He is currently the CEO of [[Hayward, California]] based [[Alphabet Energy]], which he co-founded in 2008 with [[Peidong Yang]]. Alphabet Energy is the first company to manufacture silicon [[thermoelectric]] devices and deploy commercial thermoelectric [[waste heat recovery]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/08/100823-energy-electric-power-from-heat/ Tapping into the Electric Power of Heat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Alphabet Energy was named a Technology Pioneer by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weforum.org/community/technology-pioneers&lt;/ref&gt; Scullin received the company's recognition at a ceremony in China in September 2013 and subsequently attended the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2014. Alphabet Energy has previously won the [[Cleantech Open]]'s People's Choice, National Runner Up, California Sustainability, and California Finalist awards. The company has also won awards from [[Opportunity Green]] and [[R&amp;D100]], and is backed by leading investors in the field of clean energy technology including [[TPG]], [[Claremont Creek Ventures]], and [[CalCEF]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/01/alphabet-energy-pilots/ Alphabet Energy's Waste-Heat Recovery Tech Is Out Of The Lab, Pilot Projects Underway | TechCrunch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For his pioneering work in the field of alternative energy, Scullin was named to the ''[[Forbes]]'' list of "30 Under 30" in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mef45jdde/matthew-scullin-29/ ''[[Forbes]]'' "30 Under 30" in 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scullin was born and raised in the [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], where he attended the [[United Nations International School]].

The '''Mauro Solar Riser''' is an [[United States|American]] [[biplane]] [[ultralight]] [[electric aircraft]] that was the first manned aircraft to fly on solar power. It was also only the second solar-powered aircraft to fly, after the unmanned [[AstroFlight Sunrise]], which had first flown 4 1/2 years earlier.&lt;ref name="EAAMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.airventuremuseum.org/collection/aircraft/UFM-Mauro%20Solar%20Riser.asp|title = UFM/MAURO SOLAR RISER|accessdate = 6 March 2011|last = [[Experimental Aircraft Association]]|authorlink = |year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astroflight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astroflight.com/pdfs/SolarHistory.pdf |title=AIAA paper 84-1429 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |last=AIAA/SAE/ASME 20th Joint Propulsion Conference |authorlink= |year=1984 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707180738/http://www.astroflight.com/pdfs/SolarHistory.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
The president of [[Ultralight Flying Machines]], Larry Mauro, created the Solar Riser by converting a stock [[UFM Easy Riser]] hang glider to solar power. Normally foot-launched, the Solar Riser had wheeled landing gear added. Power is supplied by a [[Bosch Rexroth|Bosch]] electric starter motor of {{convert|3.5|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} connected to a 30 volt DC [[Nickel-cadmium battery]] pack taken from a [[Hughes 500]] helicopter, powering a {{convert|41|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} propeller through a reduction drive made from a [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]] and two pulleys. The battery is charged by a series of [[photovoltaic solar panel]]s mounted in the top wing that provide 350 Watts of power. The solar cells are not sufficient to provide power in flight and all flights were made by recharging the battery on the ground from the solar cells and then flying using energy stored in the battery. A charge in bright sunshine for an hour and a half yields a flight of 3–5 minutes.&lt;ref name="EAAMuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astroflight" /&gt;

Because the battery power is enough to launch the aircraft for a soaring flight it is theoretically possible to launch on battery power, soar while the batteries are being charged by sunlight and then continue powered flight. The Solar Riser did not employ the most efficient cells available at the time and the upper wing had room for twice the number of cells to be installed. Early plans called for upgrading and increasing the number of cells so that sustained electric flight could be made, using only solar energy and not battery power, but these plans were never completed.&lt;ref name="EAAMuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astroflight" /&gt;

==Operational history==
The Solar Riser made the first man-carrying flight on solar power at noon on 29 April 1979 at [[Flabob Airport]] in [[Riverside, California]]. The aircraft reached a maximum height of about {{convert|40|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and flew {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1|abbr=on}}. A number of other flights of similar height and duration were flown, including demonstration flights at [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]] before the aircraft was retired to a museum.&lt;ref name="EAAMuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="astroflight" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glider Rider, June 1979 page 31 by Michael Jones&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Science with neutrons}}
In [[nuclear engineering]], a '''neutron moderator''' is a medium that reduces the speed of [[fast neutron]]s, thereby turning them into [[thermal neutron]]s capable of sustaining a [[nuclear chain reaction]] involving [[uranium-235]] or a similar [[fissile]] [[nuclide]].

Commonly used moderators include [[water|regular (light) water]] (roughly 75% of the world's reactors), solid [[graphite]] (20% of reactors) and [[heavy water]] (5% of reactors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Beryllium]] has also been used in some experimental types, and [[hydrocarbon]]s have been suggested as another possibility.

== Moderation ==
'''Neutrons''' are normally bound into an [[atomic nucleus]], and do not exist free for long in nature. The unbound [[neutron]] has a [[half-life]] of [[Free_neutron_decay|10 minutes and 11 seconds]]. The release of neutrons from the nucleus requires exceeding the [[binding energy]] of the neutron, which is typically 7-9 [[MeV]] for most [[isotopes]]. [[Neutron source]]s generate free neutrons by a variety of nuclear reactions, including [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. Whatever the source of neutrons, they are released with energies of several MeV.

According to the [[equipartition theorem]], the average [[kinetic energy]], &lt;math&gt;\bar{E}&lt;/math&gt;, can be related to [[temperature]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,via:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{E}=\frac{1}{2}m_n \langle v^2 \rangle=\frac{3}{2}k_B T&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt; is the neutron mass, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the average neutron speed, and &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kratz|first1=Jens-Volker|last2=Lieser|first2=Karl Heinrich|title=Nuclear and Radiochemistry: Fundamentals and Applications|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9783527653355|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gXNwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT346&amp;dq=neutron+moderator+kinetic+energy+%22boltzmann+constant%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU9o6gztnaAhXM5IMKHb6eAbY4ChDoAQhJMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=neutron%20moderator%20kinetic%20energy%20%22boltzmann%20constant%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Graef|first1=Marc|last2=McHenry|first2=Michael E.|title=Structure of Materials: An Introduction to Crystallography, Diffraction and Symmetry|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139560474|page=324|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMUgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=neutron+moderator+kinetic+energy+%22boltzmann+constant%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx5ZvoydnaAhWK6YMKHV_IBngQ6AEISjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=neutron%20moderator%20kinetic%20energy%20%22boltzmann%20constant%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic [[neutron temperature]] of several-MeV neutrons is several tens of billions [[kelvin]].

Moderation is the process of the reduction of the initial high speed (high kinetic energy) of the free neutron. Since energy is conserved, this reduction of the neutron speed takes place by transfer of energy to a material called a ''moderator''.

The probability of scattering of a neutron from a nucleus is given by the [[nuclear cross section|scattering cross section]]. The first couple of collisions with the moderator may be of sufficiently high energy to excite the nucleus of the moderator. Such a collision is [[inelastic collision|inelastic]], since some of the kinetic energy is transformed to [[potential energy]] by exciting some of the internal [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the nucleus to form an [[Nuclear isomer|excited state]]. As the energy of the neutron is lowered, the collisions become predominantly [[elastic collision|elastic]], i.e., the total kinetic energy and momentum of the system (that of the neutron and the nucleus) is conserved.

Given the [[Momentum#Special case: m1.3Dm2|mathematics of elastic collisions]], as neutrons are very light compared to most nuclei, the most efficient way of removing kinetic energy from the neutron is by choosing a moderating nucleus that has near identical mass.

[[Image:Elastischer stoß.gif|frame|center|Elastic collision of equal masses]]

A collision of a '''neutron''', which has mass of 1, with a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H nucleus (a [[proton]]) could result in the neutron losing virtually all of its energy in a single head-on collision. More generally, it is necessary to take into account both glancing and head-on collisions. The ''mean logarithmic reduction of neutron energy per collision'', &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, depends only on the atomic mass, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, of the nucleus and is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\xi= \ln\frac{E_0}{E}=1+\frac{(A-1)^2}{2A}\ln\left(\frac{A-1}{A+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="

This can be reasonably approximated to the very simple form &lt;math&gt;\xi\simeq \frac{2}{A+1}&lt;/math&gt;.{{clarify|reason=Nonsense, it's a decreasing function and the other one is an increasing function.|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref name="

[[Image:Translational motion.gif|frame|right|In a system at thermal equilibrium, neutrons (red) are elastically scattered by a hypothetical moderator of free hydrogen nuclei (blue), undergoing thermally activated motion. Kinetic energy is transferred between particles. As the neutrons have essentially the same mass as [[protons]] and there is no absorption, the velocity distributions of both particles types would be well-described by a single [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]].]]

===Choice of moderator materials===
Some nuclei have larger [[Neutron cross section#Absorption cross section|absorption cross sections]] than others, which removes free neutrons from the [[flux]]. Therefore, a further criterion for an efficient moderator is one for which this parameter is small. The ''moderating efficiency'' gives the ratio of the [[Nuclear cross section#Macroscopic cross section|macroscopic cross sections]] of scattering, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_s&lt;/math&gt;, weighted by &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; divided by that of absorption, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_a&lt;/math&gt;: i.e., &lt;math&gt;\frac{\xi\Sigma_s}{\Sigma_a}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Weston" /&gt; For a compound moderator composed of more than one element, such as light or heavy water, it is necessary to take into account the moderating and absorbing effect of both the hydrogen isotope and oxygen atom to calculate &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. To bring a neutron from the fission energy of &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; 2 MeV to an &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of 1 eV takes an expected &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of 16 and 29 collisions for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, respectively. Therefore, neutrons are more rapidly moderated by light water, as H has a far higher &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_s&lt;/math&gt;. However, it also has a far higher &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_a&lt;/math&gt;, so that the moderating efficiency is nearly 80 times higher for heavy water than for light water.&lt;ref name="Weston" /&gt;

''The ideal moderator is of low mass, high scattering cross section, and low absorption cross section''.

===Distribution of neutron velocities once moderated===
After sufficient impacts, the speed of the neutron will be comparable to the speed of the nuclei given by thermal motion; this neutron is then called a [[thermal neutron]], and the process may also be termed ''thermalization''. Once at equilibrium at a given temperature the distribution of speeds (energies) expected of rigid spheres scattering elastically is given by the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. This is only slightly modified in a real moderator due to the speed (energy) dependence of the absorption cross-section of most materials, so that low-speed neutrons are preferentially absorbed,&lt;ref name="DB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/ Neutron scattering lengths and cross sections] V.F. Sears, ''Neutron News'' 3, No. 3, 26-37 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; so that the true neutron velocity distribution in the core would be slightly hotter than predicted.

==Reactor moderators==
In a [[thermal-neutron reactor]], the nucleus of a heavy fuel element such as [[uranium]] absorbs a [[thermal neutron|slow-moving free neutron]], becomes unstable, and then splits ("[[Nuclear fission|fission]]s") into two smaller atoms ("[[fission product]]s"). The fission process for [[uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] nuclei yields two fission products, two to three [[fast neutron|fast-moving free neutrons]], plus an amount of [[energy]] primarily manifested in the kinetic energy of the recoiling fission products. The free neutrons are emitted with a kinetic energy of ~2 MeV each. Because more [[free neutron]]s are released from a uranium fission event than thermal neutrons are required to initiate the event, the reaction can become self-sustaining &amp;mdash; a [[chain reaction]] &amp;mdash; under controlled conditions, thus liberating a tremendous amount of energy (see article [[nuclear fission]]).

[[Image:U235 Fission cross section.png|thumb|left|450px|[[Fission cross section]], measured in [[barn (unit)|barns]] (a unit equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is a function of the energy (so-called [[excitation function]]) of the neutron colliding with a &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U nucleus. Fission probability decreases as neutron energy (and speed) increases. This explains why most reactors fueled with &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U need a moderator to sustain a chain reaction and why removing a moderator can shut down a reactor.]]

The probability of further fission events is determined by the [[nuclear cross section|fission cross section]], which is dependent upon the speed (energy) of the incident neutrons. For thermal reactors, high-energy neutrons in the MeV-range are much less likely to cause further fission. (Note: It is not ''impossible'' for fast neutrons to cause fission, just much less likely.) The newly released fast neutrons, moving at roughly 10% of the [[speed of light]], must be slowed down or "moderated," typically to speeds of a few kilometres per second, if they are to be likely to cause further fission in neighbouring [[uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] nuclei and hence continue the chain reaction. This speed happens to be equivalent to temperatures in the few hundred Celsius range.

In all moderated reactors, some neutrons of all energy levels will produce fission, including fast neutrons. Some reactors are more fully ''thermalised'' than others; for example, in a [[CANDU reactor]] nearly all fission reactions are produced by thermal neutrons, while in a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) a considerable portion of the fissions are produced by higher-energy neutrons. In the proposed water-cooled [[supercritical water reactor]] (SCWR), the proportion of fast fissions may exceed 50%, making it technically a [[fast neutron reactor]].

A [[fast reactor]] uses no moderator, but relies on fission produced by unmoderated fast neutrons to sustain the chain reaction. In some fast reactor designs, up to 20% of fissions can come from direct fast neutron fission of [[uranium-238]], an isotope which is not [[fissile]] at all with thermal neutrons.

Moderators are also used in non-reactor neutron sources, such as [[plutonium]]-[[beryllium]] and [[spallation]] sources.

== Form and location ==

The form and location of the moderator can greatly influence the cost and safety of a reactor.  Classically, moderators were precision-machined blocks of high purity graphite&lt;ref name="arregui16b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arregui Mena | first1 = J.D. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2016 | title = Spatial variability in the mechanical properties of Gilsocarbon | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308515387_Spatial_variability_in_the_mechanical_properties_of_Gilsocarbon | journal = Carbon | volume = 110| issue = | pages = 497–517| doi = 10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arregui18"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arregui Mena | first1 = J.D. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2018 | title = Characterisation of the spatial variability of material properties of Gilsocarbon and NBG-18 using random fields | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327537624_Characterisation_of_the_spatial_variability_of_material_properties_of_Gilsocarbon_and_NBG-18_using_random_fields | journal = Journal of Nuclear Materials | volume = 511 | issue = | pages = 91-108| doi = 10.1016/j.jnucmat.2018.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with embedded ducting to carry away heat.  They were in the hottest part of the reactor, and therefore subject to [[corrosion]] and [[ablation]].  In some materials, including [[graphite]], the impact of the neutrons with the moderator can cause the moderator to accumulate dangerous amounts of [[Wigner energy]].  This problem led to the infamous [[Windscale fire]] at the Windscale Piles, a nuclear reactor complex in the United Kingdom, in 1957.

Some [[pebble-bed reactor]]s' moderators are not only simple, but also inexpensive:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} the nuclear fuel is embedded in spheres of reactor-grade [[pyrolytic carbon]], roughly of the size of [[tennis ball]]s.  The spaces between the balls serve as ducting.  The reactor is operated above the Wigner annealing temperature so that the graphite does not accumulate dangerous amounts of [[Wigner energy]].

In [[CANDU]] and [[pressurized water reactor|PWR]] reactors, the moderator is liquid water ([[heavy water]] for CANDU, [[Water|light water]] for PWR).  In the event of a [[loss-of-coolant accident]] in a PWR, the moderator is also lost and the reaction will stop.  This negative [[void coefficient]] is an important safety feature of these reactors.  In CANDU the moderator is located in a separate heavy-water circuit, surrounding the pressurized heavy-water coolant channels.  This design gives CANDU reactors a positive [[void coefficient]], although the slower neutron kinetics of heavy-water moderated systems compensates for this, leading to comparable safety with PWRs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearfaq.ca/Meneley_Muzumbdar_reactivity_review_CNS2009.pdf D.A. Meneley and A.P. Muzumdar, "Power Reactor Safety Comparison - a Limited Review", Proceedings of the CNS Annual Conference, June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moderator impurities==

Good moderators are also free of neutron-absorbing impurities such as [[boron]].  In commercial nuclear power plants the moderator typically contains dissolved boron. The boron concentration of the reactor coolant can be changed by the operators by adding boric acid or by diluting with water to manipulate reactor power.  The [[German nuclear weapon project|Nazi Nuclear Program]] suffered a substantial setback when its inexpensive graphite moderators failed to work.  At that time, most graphites were deposited on boron electrodes, and the German commercial graphite contained too much boron.  Since the war-time German program never discovered this problem, they were forced to use far more expensive [[heavy water]] moderators.  In the U.S., [[Leó Szilárd]], a former chemical engineer, discovered the problem.

== Non-graphite moderators ==

Some moderators are quite expensive, for example [[beryllium]], and reactor-grade heavy water.  Reactor-grade heavy water must be 99.75% pure to enable reactions with unenriched uranium.  This is difficult to prepare because heavy water and regular water form the same [[chemical bond]]s in almost the same ways, at only slightly different speeds.

The much cheaper light water moderator (essentially very pure regular water) absorbs too many neutrons to be used with unenriched natural uranium, and therefore [[uranium enrichment]] or [[nuclear reprocessing]] becomes necessary to operate such reactors, increasing overall costs. Both enrichment and reprocessing are expensive and technologically challenging processes, and additionally both enrichment and several types of reprocessing can be used to create weapons-usable material, causing proliferation concerns. Reprocessing schemes that are more resistant to proliferation are currently under development.

The [[CANDU]] reactor's moderator doubles as a safety feature. A large tank of low-temperature, low-pressure heavy water moderates the neutrons and also acts as a heat sink in extreme [[loss of coolant|loss-of-coolant accident]] conditions.  It is separated from the fuel rods that actually generate the heat.  Heavy water is very effective at slowing down (moderating) neutrons, giving CANDU reactors their important and defining characteristic of high "neutron economy".

== Nuclear weapon design ==
{{Main|Uranium hydride bomb}}
Early speculation about [[nuclear weapon]]s assumed that an "atom bomb" would be a large amount of [[fissile]] material, moderated by a neutron moderator, similar in structure to a [[nuclear reactor]] or "pile".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html#nfaq8.2.1 Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions - 8.2.1 Early Research on Fusion Weapons]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the [[Manhattan project]] embraced the idea of a [[chain reaction]] of [[fast neutron]]s in pure metallic [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]]. Other moderated designs were also considered by the Americans; proposals included [[Uranium hydride bomb|using uranium deuteride]] as the fissile material.&lt;ref name="upshot"&gt;[http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Upshotk.html Operation Upshot–Knothole]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/w48.htm W48] - globalsecurity.org&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Niels Bohr]] considered the possibility of using a "pile" as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ask.ne.jp/~hankaku/english/np5y.html Atomic Bomb Chronology: 1942-1944]&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation was that with a [[graphite]] moderator it would be possible to achieve the chain reaction without the use of any [[isotope separation]]. In August 1945, when information of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] was relayed to the scientists of the [[German nuclear program]], interred at Farm Hall in England, chief scientist [[Werner Heisenberg]] hypothesized that the device must have been "something like a nuclear reactor, with the neutrons slowed by many collisions with a moderator".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Bethe]] in ''[[Physics Today]]'' Vol 53 (2001) [http://www.nd.edu/~nsl/Lectures/phys205/pdf/Nuclear_warfare_3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the Manhattan project, all major [[:Category:Nuclear weapons programs|nuclear weapons programs]] have relied on fast neutrons in their weapons designs. The notable exception is the ''[[Upshot-Knothole Ruth|Ruth]]'' and ''[[Upshot-Knothole Ray|Ray]]'' test explosions of [[Operation Upshot–Knothole]]. The aim of the [[University of California Radiation Laboratory]] designs was the exploration of deuterated polyethylene charge containing uranium&lt;ref name="herk"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Gregg Herken |first=Gregg |last=Herken |title=Brotherhood of the Bomb |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|chapter 15}} as a candidate thermonuclear fuel,&lt;ref name="swordsoarIII"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|203}} hoping that deuterium would fuse (becoming an active medium) if compressed appropriately. If successful, the devices could also lead to a compact primary containing minimal amount of fissile material, and powerful enough to ignite RAMROD&lt;ref name="swordsoarIII"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|149}} a [[thermonuclear weapon]] designed by UCRL at the time. For a "hydride" primary, the degree of compression would not make deuterium to fuse, but the design could be subjected to boosting, raising the yield considerably.&lt;ref name="swordsoarI"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=I |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|258}} The [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]] consisted of a mix of [[uranium deuteride]] (UD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name="swordsoarIII"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|202}} and deuterated polyethylene. The core tested in ''Ray'' used uranium low enriched in U&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;, and in both shots [[Deuterium|deuterium]] acted as the neutron moderator.&lt;ref name="swordsoarI"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=I |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|260}} The predicted [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] was 1.5 to 3 kt for ''Ruth'' (with a maximum potential yield of 20 kt&lt;ref name="swordsoarVII"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=VII |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpage|96}}) and 0.5-1 kt for ''Ray''. The tests produced yields of 200 [[tons of TNT]] each; both tests were considered to be [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzles]].&lt;ref name="upshot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;

The main benefit of using a moderator in a nuclear explosive is that the amount of fissile material needed to reach [[Criticality (status)|criticality]] may be greatly reduced. Slowing of fast neutrons will increase the [[Nuclear cross section|cross section]] for [[neutron absorption]], reducing the [[critical mass]]. A side effect is however that as the chain reaction progresses, the moderator will be heated, thus losing its ability to cool the neutrons.

Another effect of moderation is that the time between subsequent neutron generations is increased, slowing down the reaction. This makes the containment of the explosion a problem; the [[inertia]] that is used to confine [[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion type weapon|implosion type]] bombs will not be able to confine the reaction. The end result may be a fizzle instead of a bang.

The explosive power of a fully moderated explosion is thus limited, at worst it may be equal to a chemical explosive of similar mass. Again quoting Heisenberg: "One can never make an explosive with slow neutrons, not even with the heavy water machine, as then the neutrons only go with thermal speed, with the result that the reaction is so slow that the thing explodes sooner, before the reaction is complete."&lt;ref name="Rose1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Paul Lawrence Rose]]|title=Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: A Study in German Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuM9hfLqBZ8C&amp;pg=PA211|accessdate=6 May 2017|year=1998|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-21077-6|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a nuclear bomb working on [[thermal neutron]]s may be impractical, modern weapons designs may still benefit from some level of moderation. A [[beryllium]] tamper used as a [[neutron reflector]] will also act as a moderator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.7.3 Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions - 4.1.7.3.2 Reflectors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="killus"&gt;[http://unintentional-irony.blogspot.com/2007/07/n-moderation.html N Moderation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials used==
* [[Hydrogen]], as in ordinary "[[Water|light water]]". Because [[Hydrogen-1|protium]] also has a significant [[Neutron cross section|cross section]] for [[neutron capture]] only limited moderation is possible without losing too many neutrons. The less-moderated neutrons are relatively more likely to be captured by [[uranium-238]] and less likely to fission [[uranium-235]], so [[light water reactor]]s require [[enriched uranium]] to operate. 
** There are also proposals to use the compound formed by the chemical reaction of metallic uranium and hydrogen ([[uranium hydride]]—UH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as a combination fuel and moderator in [[Hydrogen Moderated Self-regulating Nuclear Power Module|a new type of reactor]].
** Hydrogen is also used in the form of cryogenic liquid [[methane]] and sometimes [[liquid hydrogen]] as a [[cold neutron]] source in some [[research reactor]]s: yielding a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] for the neutrons whose maximum is shifted to much lower energies.
** Hydrogen combined with carbon as in [[paraffin wax]] was used in some early [[German nuclear energy project|German experiments]].
* [[Deuterium]], in the form of [[heavy water]], in [[heavy water reactor]]s, e.g. [[CANDU]]. Reactors moderated with heavy water can use unenriched [[natural uranium]].
* [[Carbon]], in the form of reactor-grade [[graphite]]&lt;ref name="arregui16b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arregui Mena | first1 = J.D. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2016 | title = Spatial variability in the mechanical properties of Gilsocarbon | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308515387_Spatial_variability_in_the_mechanical_properties_of_Gilsocarbon | journal = Carbon | volume = 110| issue = | pages = 497–517| doi = 10.1016/j.carbon.2016.09.051}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[pyrolytic carbon]], used in e.g. [[RBMK]] and [[pebble-bed reactor]]s, or in compounds, e.g. [[carbon dioxide]] [http://www.bookrags.com/research/carbon-dioxide-chmc]. Lower-temperature reactors are susceptible to buildup of [[Wigner energy]] in the material. Like deuterium-moderated reactors, some of these reactors can use unenriched natural uranium.
** Graphite is also deliberately allowed to be heated to around 2000 K or higher in some [[research reactor]]s to produce a [[neutron temperature|hot neutron]] source: giving a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] whose maximum is spread out to generate higher energy neutrons.
* [[Beryllium]], in the form of metal. Beryllium is expensive and toxic, so its use is limited.
* [[Lithium]]-7, in the form of a [[lithium fluoride]] salt, typically in conjunction with [[beryllium fluoride]] salt ([[FLiBe]]). This is the most common type of moderator in a [[Molten Salt Reactor]].

Other light-nuclei materials are unsuitable for various reasons. [[Helium]] is a gas and it requires special design to achieve sufficient density; [[lithium]]-6 and [[boron]]-10 absorb neutrons.

[[File:Open Circuit Voltage.svg|thumb|Definition of open-circuit voltage. The box is any two-terminal device, such as a battery or solar cell. The two terminals are not connected to anything (an "open circuit"), so no current can flow into or out of either terminal. The voltage ''v&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;'' between the terminals is the open-circuit voltage of the device.]]
[[File:ShockleyQueisserVOC.svg|thumb|Black curve: The highest possible open-circuit voltage of a [[solar cell]] in the [[Shockley-Queisser limit|Shockley-Queisser model]] under unconcentrated sunlight, as a function of the semiconductor [[bandgap]]. The red dotted line shows that this voltage is always smaller than the bandgap voltage.]]
'''Open-circuit voltage''' (abbreviated as '''OCV''' or '''V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;''' ) is the [[voltage|difference of electrical potential]] between two terminals of a device when disconnected from any circuit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.learnabout-electronics.org/resistors_18.php&lt;/ref&gt; There is no [[External electric load|external load]] connected. No external [[electric current]] flows between the terminals.  Alternatively, the open-circuit voltage may be thought of as the voltage that must be applied to a solar cell or a battery to stop the current. It is sometimes given the symbol V&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;. In [[network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis]] this voltage is also known as the [[Thévenin's theorem|Thévenin voltage]].

The open-circuit [[voltage]]s of batteries and [[solar cell]]s are often quoted under particular conditions (state-of-charge, illumination, temperature, etc.).

The potential difference mentioned for batteries and cells is usually the open-circuit voltage. The open-circuit voltage is also known as the [[electromotive force]] (emf), which is the maximum potential difference when there is no current and the circuit is not closed.


To calculate the open-circuit voltage, one can use a method similar to that below:

Consider the circuit:
[[File:Given Circuit.PNG|alt=Given Circuit|centre|Given Circuit]]
If we want to find the open-circuit voltage across 5Ω resistor. First disconnect it from the circuit:
[[File:Modified Circuit.PNG|alt=Modified Circuit|centre|Modified Circuit]]

Find the equivalent resistance in loop 1 and hence find the current in the loop. Use Ohm’s Law to find the [[Voltage drop|potential drop]] across the resistance C. The resistor B does not affect the open-circuit voltage. Since no current is flowing through it, there is no potential drop across it. So we can easily ignore it.

Therefore, the potential drop across the resistance C is ''V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.''

This is just an example. Many other ways can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN7RoJ6GC9k|accessdate = 2018-06-03|title=Thevenin's Theorem-One Independent Source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overhead wire markers''' are safety instruments applied to the [[overhead power line]]s marking transmission lines and ropeways along the flight path during the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obstacle-lights.com/day-marking-spheres.html Aerial marker balls for Power lines]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Einebenenleitung.jpg|thumb|markers on a line near an [[airfield]]]] Markers are often installed on overhead lines near airfields, or at river crossings where there is a possibility of float-equipped aircraft using the river. Some markers contain [[conductor marking lights]] or strobe lights to improve visibility at night or in fog.

The '''phosphonium''' (more obscurely: '''phosphinium''') [[cation]] describes [[polyatomic ion|polyatomic cation]]s with the [[chemical formula]] {{Chem|PR|4|+}} (R = H, alkyl, aryl, halide).  They are tetrahedral and generally colorless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=D. E. C. |last=Corbridge |title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology |edition=5th |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |date=1995 |isbn=0-444-89307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of phosphonium cations==
===Phosphonium, {{Chem|PH|4|+}}===
The parent '''phosphonium ''' is {{Chem|PH|4|+}}.  One example is phosphonium iodide {{Chem|PH|4|+|I|-}}. Salts of the parent {{Chem|PH|4|+}} are rarely encountered, but this ion is an intermediate in the preparation of the industrially useful [[tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride]]:
:PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl + 4 CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → {{chem|P(CH|2|OH)|4|+|Cl|−}}

===Protonated organophosphines===
Many phosphonium salts are produced by protonation of [[phosphine#Phosphines|primary, secondary, and tertiary phosphines]]:
:PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|HPR|3|+}}
The basicity of phosphines follows the usual trends, with R = alkyl being more basic than R = aryl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Li, T.; Lough, A. J.; Morris, R. H.|title=An Acidity Scale of Tetrafluoroborate Salts of Phosphonium and Iron Hydride Compounds in [D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]Dichloromethane|journal=Chem. Eur. J.|year=2007|volume=13|pages=3796–3803|doi=10.1002/chem.200601484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tetraorganophosphonium cations===
The most common phosphonium compounds have four organic substituents attached to phosphorus.  The [[Quaternary compound|quaternary]] phosphonium cations include [[tetraphenylphosphonium chloride|tetraphenylphosphonium]], (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[tetramethylphosphonium bromide|tetramethylphosphonium]] {{chem|P(CH|3|)|4|+}}.

[[File:EntryWithCollCode76731.png|thumb|Structure of solid phosphorus pentachloride, illustrating its autoionization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Finch, A.; Fitch, A.N.; Gates, P.N.|title=Crystal and Molecular structure of a metastable modification of phosphorus pentachloride|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|year=1993|pages= 957–958}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Quaternary phosphonium cations ({{Chem|PR|4|+}}) are produced by alkylation of organophosphines.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt; For example, the reaction of [[triphenylphosphine]] with [[methyl iodide]] gives methyltriphenylphosphonium iodide, the precursor to a [[Wittig reaction#Wittig reagents|Wittig reagent]]:&lt;ref name=Wittig/&gt;

===Phase-transfer catalysts and precipitating agents===
Organic phosphonium cations are lipophilic and can be useful in [[phase transfer catalysis]], much like quaternary ammonium salts.

The cation [[tetraphenylphosphonium]] ({{chem|PPh|4|+}}) is a useful precipitating agent.

===Reagents for organic synthesis===
Wittig reagents are used in [[organic synthesis]].  They are derived from [[phosphonium salt]]s, which is in turn prepared by deprotonation of alkylphosphonium salts.  A strong base such as  [[N-Butyllithium|butyllithium]] or sodium amide is required for the deprotonation:
:[Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R]X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li   →   Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CHR  +  LiX  +  C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;

One of the simplest ylide is [[methylenetriphenylphosphorane]] (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Wittig&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=[[Georg Wittig|George Wittig]] U.

The compounds Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X = Cl, Br) are used in the [[Kirsanov reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in Organophosphorus Chemistry. I.

The [[Kinnear–Perren reaction]] is used to prepare alkylphosphonyl dichlorides (RP(O)Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and alkyl[[phosphonate]] esters (RP(O)(OR')&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Alkylation of [[phosphorus trichloride]] in the presence of [[aluminium trichloride]] give the alkyltrichlorophosphonium salts, which are versatile intermediates:&lt;ref name = Svara&gt;{{ Ullmann | author = Svara, J.; Weferling, N.; Hofmann, T. | title = Phosphorus Compounds, Organic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a19_545.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now-defunct '''Prydniprovsky Chemical Plant''' ({{lang-uk|Придніпровський хімічний завод, ПХЗ}}; ''Prydniprovsky khimichnyi zavod'', '''''PHZ''''') in the city of [[Kamianske]], [[Ukraine]], enriched [[uranium]] ore for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nuclear program from 1948 through 1991, preparing [[Yellowcake]].

Its processing wastes are now stored in nine open-air dumping grounds containing about 36 million tones of sand-like low-[[radioactivity|radioactive]] residue, occupying an area of 2,5 million square meters. The sites, improperly constructed from the very beginning, have been abandoned by the industry long ago and remain in very poor condition. The top concern is the dumps’ closeness to both the large [[Dnieper River]] and city residential areas. According to government experts, the [[dam]]s separating the grounds from soil water are already leaking, causing the pollution of Dnieper basin. It is believed that further deterioration of the dams, irrespective of any outer accidents, may cause a devastating radioactive [[mudslide]]. The Ukrainian government is now tightening control over the grounds and seeking international aid in projects aimed at securing and the gradual re-processing of the PHZ wastes. Recently, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] has evaluated the condition of the sites and is considering dispatching a major observation and aid mission to Kamianske.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news2000.org.ua/print?a=%2Fpaper%2F5789 Uranium wastes threaten the east of Ukraine]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503192631/http://news2000.org.ua/print?a=%2Fpaper%2F5789 |date=2008-05-03 }}, 2000, July 14, 2006; [https://web.archive.org/web/20080503193856/http://www.ukrindustrial.com/news/index.php?newsid=203647 France to help removing industrial dump in Dniprodzerhynsk], Ukrayina Promyshlennaya, February 26, 2008; [http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=9548 IAEA technical experts start working in Dniprodzerzhynsk] March 4, 2008; [http://news.ugmk.info/?from=80&amp;page=0&amp;sfera=4&amp;code=1205225540 IAEA expert group finished inspecting the PHZ]{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, UGMK, March 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The isolated dump grounds (about nine altogether, at a depth of 3 m) of the former plant are now located in different parts of the city and operated by the purposely-created "Barrier" State Enterprise - with an obscure-meaning new name that has yet to be widely known. That is why the sites, the company, and the whole problem is still commonly referred to as the "Prydniprovsky Chemical Plant (PHZ) wastes".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6062">[[File:Pluie saharienne sur Schlefflera 2.jpg|thumb|The leaves of this [[Schefflera]] show the dust stains of a rain dust (near Paris, France)]]
'''Rain dust''' or '''snow dust''', traditionally known as '''muddy rain''', '''red rain''',  or '''coloured rain''', is a variety of [[rain]] (or any other form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]) which contains enough [[Mineral dust|desert dust]] for the dust to be visible without using a microscope.

== History ==
The rain dust phenomenon was studied by Italian scientist [[Giuseppe Maria Giovene]] (1753–1837), who managed to correctly explain the phenomenon as early as 1803. On 7 March 1803, rain dust fell over [[South Italy]]'s region [[Apulia]]. At that time, people believed that the rain was caused by the explosions of Italy's volcanoes [[Mount Vesuvius]] or [[Mount Etna|Etna]], or that it was due to the transport of matter coming from the sea floor and raised by vapor. Giuseppe Maria Giovene brilliantly managed to relate the phenomenon to the wind which occurred prior to the rain event, and he came to the conclusion that the sand had come from Africa and that it had been pushed by the wind coming from south-east.&lt;ref&gt;[[#elogio-storico |elogio-storico, pag. 20]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#pioggia-rossa|pioggia-rossa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Rain dust is common in the Western and Southern Mediterranean, where the dust supply comes from the atmospheric depressions going through the northern part of North Africa. The main sources of desert dust reach the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] in the form of dust transported by wind or rain from the [[Sahara]], [[Atlas Mountains]] in [[Morocco]] and Central [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name=JGR&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Avila | first1 = Anna | last2 = Queralt-Mitjans | first2 = Ignasi | last3 = Alarcón | first3 = Marta | title = Mineralogical composition of African dust delivered by red rains over northeastern Spain | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 102 | pages = 21977 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1029/97JD00485 | bibcode=1997JGR...10221977A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mud rains are relatively frequent and had been increasing in early 1990s in the [[Mediterranean Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sala | first1 = José Quereda | last2 = Cantos | first2 = Jorge Olcina | last3 = Chiva | first3 = Enrique Montón | title = Red dust rain within the Spanish Mediterranean area | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 32 | pages = 215 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1007/BF00143711 | issue = 2| bibcode = 1996ClCh...32..215S }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It also occurs in arid [[desert]] regions of [[North America]] such as west [[Texas]] or [[Arizona]]. It occasionally happens in the grasslands as it did in [[Bexar County, Texas]] on March 18, 2008.

It may also occur in some regions of [[South Italy]] (sand coming from [[North Africa]]), but it is a very rare phenomenon.

== Dust composition ==
The rain dust  is very [[alkaline]].&lt;ref name=JGR/&gt; Some of the large particles contain mixtures of chemicals such as sulfate and sea salt (chiefly with sodium, chlorine and magnesium).  Major minerals in order of decreasing abundance are:  [[illite]], [[quartz]], [[smectite]], [[palygorskite]], [[kaolinite]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]] and [[feldspar]]s.&lt;ref name=JGR/&gt;  In [[Majorca]] a study finds that the size, by volume, 89% of the particles from rain dust fraction corresponded to [[silt]] (between 0.002&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.063&amp;nbsp;mm) and that there was virtually no [[clay]] sized particles (less than 0.29%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.raco.cat/index.php/BolletiSHNBalears/article/viewPDFInterstitial/169315/245251 | author = Fornós, Joan J., Crespí, Damià; Fiol, Lluís | title = Aspectes mineralogics i texturals de la pols procedent de les pluges de 1ang a les IIles Balears: la seva importancia en alguns processos geologics recents | journal = Boll. Soc. Hist. Nat. Balears | volume =  40 | year = 1997 | pages =  114–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
* The particulates that rain dust carries are important for the formation of long-term [[soil]] counteracting, in large part, the effects of [[soil erosion]]. The amount of solids in rain dust have been estimated at 5.3&amp;nbsp;grams per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (in a study made in [[Montseny]], [[Catalonia]]){{citation needed|date=February 2011}} in this location the dust provides 34% of the calcium needed by the [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]]. The amount of the deposition of dust particles is highly variable depending on the year.
* Saharan dust significantly increases the [[pH]] of rain water. This may counteract the effects of [[acid rain]].
*[[Radioactivity]] from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] was carried by rain dust to Greece in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0265-931X(00)00182-X | title = Coloured rain dust from Sahara Desert is still radioactive | year = 2001 | last1 = Papastefanou | first1 = C | journal = Journal of Environmental Radioactivity | volume = 55 | pages = 109–112 | pmid = 11381550 | last2 = Manolopoulou | first2 = M | last3 = Stoulos | first3 = S | last4 = Ioannidou | first4 = A | last5 = Gerasopoulos | first5 = E | issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blood/red rain ==

Rain dust is the most common cause of [[blood rain]].

Red rain is however not always rain dust, see for example the [[Red rain in Kerala]].

The '''Saab 9-3''' is a [[compact executive car]] that was originally developed and manufactured by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[car manufacturer|automaker]] [[Saab Automobile|Saab]].

The 9-3 was first based on the [[GM2900 platform]] and subsequently changed to the [[GM Epsilon platform]]. Other vehicles using this platform included the [[Opel Vectra]] and [[Cadillac BLS]]. Saab's last owners, [[National Electric Vehicle Sweden]] (NEVS) were assembling the 9-3 [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] (saloon) as Saab's only model.

== Overview ==
The car was badged as '''9&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''' starting in the 1998 model year, when Saab revised the naming strategy of their small car to match that of the larger 9&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The model was advertised as '''9-3''', pronounced as "nine three". The Saab 9-3 was launched in 1997 for the 1998 model year essentially as a rebadged 2nd Generation [[Saab 900]] (1994–1997 model), and succeeded by a redesigned 9-3 for the 2003 model year. It is not to be confused with the [[Saab 93]], pronounced "ninety three", which was a car produced by Saab from 1955 to 1960.

The first generation 9-3, an updated [[Saab 900 (NG)]] was launched in 1998 for the 1999 model year. It was known to enthusiasts as the OG 9-3 (old generation) and internally as body style 9400. It continued as a full line through the 2002 model year. (In 2003, Saab produced only the convertible model of this line – other models were replaced by the second generation 9-3). 
Saab claimed that 1,100 changes were made, including a revised [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] in an attempt to tighten up the handling characteristics of its predecessor, the Saab 900 (1994–1998 model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.saabmuseum.com/9-3/index.html |title=Saab 9-3 history at The SaabMuseum.com |publisher=Saabmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured revised styling with some models receiving a black rear [[spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] and removed Saab's trademark centrally mounted "snow flap". It was available as a three or five-door [[hatchback]], and as a two-door [[convertible]]. It was the last small Saab to use the company's ''[[Saab H engine|H engine]]''. Improvements over the [[Saab 900 (NG)]] included better [[crashworthiness]] with more extensive A-pillar reinforcements, stronger door sills and frames, standard torso/head side-airbags and [[Saab Active Head Restraints]]. Other notable changes were stronger AC compressor and a switch to an hydraulically operated convertible top instead of electric.   

The 9-3 was available with a new variant of the B204 engine (B204E, {{convert|154|hp|kW|abbr=on}}), a low pressure turbo (LPT) engine based on the B204L used in the last generation Saab 900. For the U.S. market, all 9-3s received turbocharged petrol engines with the "full pressure turbo" (B204L, {{convert|185|hp|kW|abbr=on}}) as the standard offering, and a "HOT" (B204R, 200&amp;nbsp;hp) variant in the SE models for the 1999 model year. The 2000 model year saw a revision from SAAB's [[Trionic T5.5]] to Trionic 7 engine management system. The T7 based engines were the B205L with {{convert|185|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and the B205R HOT engine with {{convert|205|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The first generation 9-3 was also the first Saab available with a diesel engine, a unit also found in the [[Opel Vectra]], Astra G, Signum, Zafira A. Unlike the [[Saab 900 (NG)]], the 9-3 is fitted with a [[CAN bus]] like the Saab 9-5.

A Saab innovation is the '[[Night Panel]]', carried over from the Saab 900, which permits dousing of the instrument panel lighting, except for essential information, for less distraction when night driving.

A total of 326,370 first generation 9-3s were built.

==={{Anchor|Viggen}} Saab 9-3 Viggen ===
[[File:Saab 9-3 YS3E Viggen.JPG|thumb|Saab 9-3 Viggen]]

A high-powered version of the Saab 9-3, the "Viggen" (English: ''[[Thunderbolt]]''), was marketed from 1999 to 2002. It was named after the [[Saab 37 Viggen]] aircraft.

The Viggen included a turbocharged 2.3&amp;nbsp;L engine (B235R). Initially it was rated at {{convert|225|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and later at {{convert|230|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} on {{convert|1.0|bar|psi|abbr=on}} of boost from its [[Mitsubishi companies|Mitsubishi TD04-HL15-5]] turbocharger. The cars were equipped with a higher capacity intercooler, performance tuned ECU, flow through muffler and tip, heavy duty clutch and pressure plate, stiffened and lowered springs, firmer dampers, as well as stronger CV joints and driveshafts.

In 1999, the Viggen was the first 9-3 to use Saab's [[Trionic]] 7 engine management system. The 2001 model year introduced a [[Traction Control System]] (TCS). The TCS was later made available in the SE line.

The car featured a rear wing that required relocating the radio antenna, aerodynamically designed bumpers and side skirts, special bolstered and colored leather seats (in four colors: black with black inserts (charcoal), black with blue inserts (deep blue), black with orange inserts (flame ochre), or tan with tan inserts), sportier suspension, as well as bigger wheels and upgraded brakes.

The Viggen was only available with a five-speed manual transmission, CD player, power moonroof, and (what were initially) Viggen-specific motorised and heated leather seats with the Viggen delta logo embossed in the backrest; these were later also available in the Aero model (U.S. market 'SE' model) without the embossed Viggen logo. Some colors featured carbon-fibre interior trim from its introduction to the middle of the 2001 model year. Cars built afterward came with a less expensive printed gray pattern for the dash and standard trim.

New buyers of Viggens in the U.S. were offered two days of advanced driving instruction at [[Road Atlanta]] and an opportunity to dine with Saab USA executives from nearby Norcross, Georgia.

Some motoring journalists were critical of untamed torque steer in low gears.&lt;ref name="evo.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.evo.co.uk/gallery/carreviews/cargrouptests/204917/ten_worst_cars_tested.html#5 |title=The ten worst cars we've ever tested |date=16 January 2007 |work=evo.co.uk |accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 4,600 Viggens were manufactured until production ended in June 2002; of which 500 units were produced for the UK market. For 1999, 426 3-door Viggens were imported into the U.S.; of those 420 were blue, 2 were silver, 2 were Monte Carlo yellow, and 2 were black.{{#tag:ref|Compliments of SAAB USA|group=|name=SAAB USA}}

=== First generation 9-3 engines ===
[[File:Saab ecopower engine.jpg|thumb|[[Saab H engine|Saab H Engine]] with [[Saab Direct Ignition]] and [[Trionic|Trionic Engine Management]], Shown Here In Trionic 7 Trim.]]
Other than the diesel engines, all the first generation engines were versions of the [[Saab H engine]]. Other than the [[Saab 9-5]], the first generation 9-3 was the last to utilise this all Saab engine design. All versions of this engine feature a [[Double overhead cam|DOHC]] [[16-valve]] design with Saab's [[Saab Direct Ignition]]. All turbocharged engines utilise Saab's [[Trionic]] engine management system which works hand in hand with the Direct Ignition's IDM module (mounted to the top of the engine, directly engaging the spark plugs). The later two technologies were migrated into other [[General Motors|GM]] products during the ten years that GM controlled Saab. All of the engines, other than the normally aspirated version and the low-pressure turbo, had high specific power outputs. The B205R generated {{convert|102.5|hp}}  per litre and {{convert|210|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]].

The second-generation 9-3 was launched in January 2002, at the [[North American International Auto Show#2002|North American International Auto Show]] for MY03. Originally, the 9-3 was due to début with the [[Opel Vectra]] in October 2001, at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], but in July 2001, it was announced that delays had forced [[General Motors]] to postpone the introduction.&lt;ref name="Autotrader.com"&gt;[http://www.autotrader.com/research/article/4099/spy-shots-2003-saab-9-3.jsp/Autotrader.com/&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081843/http://www.autotrader.com/research/article/4099/spy-shots-2003-saab-9-3.jsp/Autotrader.com/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cars were eventually introduced in March 2002, at the Geneva Motor Show. The convertible version of the second-generation 9-3 began with the MY04, and SportCombi with MY05.

The new 9-3, like all other Saabs, remained a [[front-wheel drive]] car. The most drastic change from the former generation was the elimination of the hatchback design. The second-generation 9-3 was available as a four-door [[saloon (car)|saloon]], an estate (introduced in late 2005, known as the SportWagon, SportCombi or Sport-Hatch dependant on the market), and a two-door [[convertible]] (introduced in 2004). It included [[Saab Active Head Restraints]] (SAHR II) to reduce whiplash and ReAxs, a passive rear wheel steering design and passive toe-in to help reduce [[understeer]] under heavy braking.

[[File:2005-2006 Saab 9-3 Linear 1.8t convertible (2011-06-15).jpg|thumb|left|Saab 9-3 Linear 1.8t convertible, Australia]]
[[File:2009 Saab 9-3 (MY08) Aero 2.8T sedan (2015-07-09) 02.jpg|thumb|left|Saab 9-3 Aero 2.8T sedan, Australia]]

The new 9-3 departed from the [[Saab H engine|EcoPower]] engine used previously for a new 2.0&amp;nbsp;L [[inline-four engine]] [[GM Ecotec engine|''Ecotec'']] engine from [[General Motors]]' for the petrol powered models. There are three different versions of the [[turbocharged]] inline-four, with the amount of turbo boost determining the power output. The {{convert|150|hp|abbr=on}} version (1.8t) was standard in the non-U.S. market Linear form (trim-level). The {{convert|175|hp}} version (2.0t) was standard in U.S. market Linear or non-U.S. market Vector form, mated with a 5-speed manual transmission or a 5-speed 'Sentronic' which is a traditional [[automatic transmission|automatic]], not to be confused with SAAB's earlier [[Manumatic|'Sensonic']] which was a manual transmission which allowed for shifting without a clutch pedal. The 210 horsepower 2.0T (B207R engine) was available in both the Arc and Vector forms, and as the Aero in Australia and the United Kingdom. In 2003 Aero, Arc,Linear and Vector models, the standard manual transmission was a 5-speed gearbox with the 6 speed a £200 optional extra (UK market price.)

The 9-3 and the [[Opel Vectra]] were the first of the global [[GM Epsilon platform]], which was then lengthened to accommodate four new cousins, the [[Chevrolet Malibu|Chevrolet Malibu/Malibu Maxx]], the [[Pontiac G6]], and the [[Saturn Aura]]. A proprietary fiber-optic electric/electronic system, the possibility of AWD (exploited from 2008 on, dubbed [[Saab XWD]]), and ReAxs as described above, are just a few of the features exclusive to the 9-3.

=== 2004 ===
[[File:2004-2007 Saab 9-3 convertible -- 01-07-2012.jpg|thumb|left|2005–2007 Saab 9-3 convertible (US)]]
[[File:2006-2007 Saab 9-3 Linear 2.0t SportCombi (2011-11-17) 02.jpg|thumb|left|9-3 SportCombi]]

The Vector form was replaced with the Aero in the [[United States|USA]]. In addition, the Arc received the 5-speed manual in place of the 6-speed.  In the UK 210 horsepower 2.0T was also available as the 6 speed manual 9-3 Aero.

=== 2005 ===
United States versions were sold with 16-inch wheels standard (17-inch for the Aero) unlike the 15-inch wheels which were previously found in the Linear version. In the United States, but not in most countries, the 2005 was the last year of the Linear and Arc versions. In addition, the 6-speed manual was dropped and both the Arc and Aero received the 5-speed manual.

=== 2006 ===
[[File:2006 9-3 2.0T .jpg|thumb|2006 9-3 2.0T]]
A new V6 engine was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newcartestdrive.com|title=NewCarTestDrive – Car Reviews, New Cars, Used Cars &amp; Car Prices|website=www.newcartestdrive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new 2.8-liter [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Multi-cylinder engine|6-cylinder]] was also added for 2006 along with an improved 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that produced 35 more horsepower. The [[Multi-cylinder engine|4-cylinder]] option had 12.3 psi maximum turbo boost pressure and turned out {{convert|210|hp|abbr=on}}, while the 6-cylinder had 8.7 [[Turbocharger|psi boost]] and turned out {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}}. In certain markets, like Switzerland, a 230&amp;nbsp;hp variant of the 6-cylinder was also offered in Vector trim. The 2.0-litre 16-valve turbo [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] model was marketed in the United States as the 2.0T, replacing the Linear and Arc models sold until the 2005 model year. The United States 2.0T version was similar to the 2005 Arc except for U.S. Linear wheels were used. The Linear and Arc versions continued to be sold in most other countries. A special "20 Years Edition Aero Convertible" for the American market was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006 to celebrate 20 years since the introduction of the [[Saab 900]] convertible.

=== 2007 ===
[[File:Saab 9 3X förarplats 2010.jpg|thumb|left|9-3 updated interior]]

The dashboard was revamped for 2007, with the Saab Information Display moved from its high mounted position to the main instrument binnacle. The button-heavy climate control system disappeared, replaced by the [[Saab 9-5]] climate control system, [[OnStar]] was re-introduced and required when Nav was ordered in North America, and the corporate GM head unit debuted, which allowed for satellite radio and MP3 CD capability. The suspension went from harsh to firm, and the cabin was quietened. Steel Gray was also replaced with Titan Gray as an exterior color choice.
In the U.S. market, only the 210&amp;nbsp;hp 2.0-liter 16-valve turbo engine and the 250&amp;nbsp;hp 2.8-litre V-6 turbo were available. The manual transmission in the 2.0 model was changed from a 5-speed to a 6-speed.

A 60th Anniversary Edition was also offered for sedan, wagon and convertible body styles for 2007 to celebrate 60 years of SAAB. The package was available on 2.0T cars, and included unique five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, black leather sport seats with grey inserts and SAAB embossments on the front seats, dark walnut trim, black floormats with grey binding, front fog lamps and a BOSE audio system with 6-disc CD changer and satellite radio. Sedan and convertible models also received trunk-lid spoilers. An Ice Blue metallic paint was offered for the edition, as well as standard SAAB paint colors. 60th Anniversary Edition sedans were offered for $24,820 USD, SportCombi wagons for $30,065 USD, and $40,065 USD for convertibles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.motortrend.com/cars/saab/9-3/2007/112_0702_saab_60_anniversary_editions/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saab Turbo X ===
'''Saab Turbo X''' debuted at the 2007 Frankfurt auto show. It was made to celebrate SAAB's 30 years of turbocharging. All Turbo X were offered in metallic jet black with matte grey trim. The Turbo X is SAAB's first production car with the [[Saab XWD|XWD]] [[all-wheel drive]] system from [[Haldex Traction]] and eLSD. It is powered by a 2.8-litre V6 producing {{convert|280|PS|abbr=on}} mated to a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] or automatic gearbox. It has larger brakes as well as stiffer springs and shocks. The dash, shift lever and door panels have carbon fiber look and the turbo boost gauge draws its inspiration from the [[Saab 900]].&lt;ref name="automobilemag.com" /&gt;

=== 2008 facelift ===
[[File:Saab 9-3 Aero front 20081126.jpg|left|thumb|2008 Facelifted Saab 9-3 Aero convertible]]
Saab claimed over 2000 changes were made to model year 2008 cars. The 2008 range, first presented at the Saab Festival in Trollhättan, Sweden (June 10, 2007) included new frontal styling inspired by the [[Saab Aero-X]] and [[Saab 9-2X]], Saab's first use of LED "signature" lighting in the revised headlamps, new door panels, a new clamshell bonnet, new rear bumper, and frosted "ice block" rear lamps. Black replaced charcoal gray as an interior color choice. Snow Silver became a new exterior color. The 2.8T V6 powering the Aero models received a mild output boost from 250&amp;nbsp;hp to 255&amp;nbsp;hp. Some additional exterior modifications are available on the limited-edition XWD {{convert|280|hp}} 9-3 Turbo X, presented at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] (9/07).&lt;ref name="automobilemag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/frankfurt/2007/0708_2008_saab_turbo_x/ |title=2008 Saab Turbo X - 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show |publisher=Automobilemag.com |date= |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turbo X made its North American debut at the New England Auto show in late November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paragonexpo.com/310_Vehicle_Gallery.html/ New England Auto Show vehicle gallery preview.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120053451/http://www.paragonexpo.com/310_Vehicle_Gallery.html/ |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saab also released an all-wheel-drive version of the Aero, with the system dubbed "[[Saab XWD|XWD]]", in March 2008.

[[National Electric Vehicle Sweden]] (NEVS) restarted production of the Saab 9-3 Aero Sedan MY14 on December 2, 2013 in Saab's former [[Trollhättan]] assembly plant. The only exterior difference on the MY14 model is the lack of the Griffin badge, to which NEVS does not own the rights. The Griffin is replaced with a badge displaying the Saab [[logotype]], as well as new seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://teknikensvarld.se/nya-saab-9-3-aero-sedan-tre-snabba-fran-provkorningen-116842/ |title=Nya Saab 9-3 Aero Sedan – tre snabba från provkörningen |work=Teknikens Värld |first=Mattias |last=Rabe |date=26 February 2014 |language=Swedish |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 9-3 Aero MY14 features a 220-horsepower 2.0-liter direct-injected twin-scroll turbocharged engine and went on sale in Sweden on December 10. The first cars were to delivered in Spring 2014 as a "Limited Edition" model. Only two colors were available, black and Silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomorrow the internet sale of Saab cars begins |url= http://www.saabsunited.com/2013/12/tomorrow-the-internet-sale-of-saab-cars-begins.html |date=9 December 2013 |work=SaabsUnited |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9-3 no longer meets the latest Euro NCAP tests regarding pedestrian safety; therefore, only 1,000 cars of each body model could be sold in Europe, as a low-volume manufacturer. The only other market was China. An electric version was to be launched in spring 2014 in the [[China|Chinese]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Production of Saab 9-3 Aero Sedan has started in Trollhättan |url= http://saabcars.com/en/news/30194C9F3F39E4A7 |publisher=National Electric Vehicle Sweden |date=2 December 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140814043912/http://www.saabcars.com/en/news/30194C9F3F39E4A7 |archivedate=14 August 2014 |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third generation==
[[File:SaabPhoeniX.jpg|thumb|Saab PhoeniX]]
Work on a third generation Saab 9-3 started in 2007, when designers in [[General Motors]] facilities in [[Rüsselsheim]] and [[Detroit]] began work on a design study. The design language was supervised by Simon Padian, and the design team managed to produce a clay model and several computer models before General Motors announced it had put the Saab brand "under review" in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saabsunited.com/2013/01/simon-padians-vision-for-a-next-9-3.html |title=Simon Padian's vision for a next 9-3 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Saabsunited.com |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2009, during which an intended sale of Saab to Swedish supercar manufacturer [[Koenigsegg]] ultimately failed, General Motors reached an agreement with Dutch manufacturer [[Spyker N.V.]] in January 2010. The sale of Saab to Spyker was completed in late February 2010 and work on a replacement for the 9-3 was restarted virtually immediately. The new management of Saab, headed by CEO [[Victor Muller]], felt, however, that a new design language was needed to distance a newly independent Saab from General Motors.&lt;ref name=Saabsunited9-3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saabsunited.com/2013/02/the-story-of-the-9-3-phoenix.html |title=The story of the 9-3 Phoenix |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Saabsunited.com |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2015-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415165231/http://www.saabsunited.com/2013/02/the-story-of-the-9-3-phoenix.html |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller hired [[Jason Castriota]] in June 2010 to work on a scalable car platform that would serve as the basis for future Saabs, beginning with the replacement for the 9-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/castriota-goes-to-saab-2010-06-18 |title=Castriota goes to Saab |last=Philip |first=Sam |publisher=Topgear.com |date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 a number of prototypes were produced and evaluated against the prototypes made in 2007. Eventually, Castriota's prototype was chosen and the design team was instructed to develop a five-door [[combi coupé]], a [[convertible]] and a [[crossover (automobile)|crossover]] on the new platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lönnroth |first=Valdemar |url=http://ttela.se/ekonomi/saab/1.1221211-kommande-9-3-i-tre-huvudvarianter |title=Kommande 9-3 i tre huvudvarianter |language=sv |publisher=www.ttela.se |date= |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saabsunited9-3 /&gt;

The work on the new platform culminated in the unveiling of the [[Saab PhoeniX]] [[concept car]] at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2011|Geneva Motor Show]] in March 2011. By that time, Saab had run into serious [[cash flow]] problems, but work on the PhoeniX platform and the 9-3 replacement continued, even when Saab went into voluntary reconstruction in September 2011.&lt;ref name=Saabsunited9-3 /&gt; The replacement of the 9-3, which had been renamed 900 by that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/the-future-of-saab-to-draw-heavily-on-heritage-car-news |title=The Future of Saab to Draw Heavily on Heritage |last=Meiners |first=Jens |publisher=Caranddriver.com |date=April 2010 |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to have 1.6 liter turbo engine supplied by [[BMW]], which was also to supply the car's start-stop system. The car was to have a hybrid drivetrain and was to be released in both a premium Aero and an economy Vector variant.&lt;ref name=Saabsunited9-3 /&gt;

When Saab finally filed for bankruptcy in December 2011, Castriota and his team had finished most work on the car's body and its engineering, with the interior remaining the last hurdle before completing the car, which was planned for Fall 2012.&lt;ref name=Saabsunited9-3 /&gt; The main assets of the bankrupt company were acquired by [[National Electric Vehicle Sweden]] (NEVS), which may revisit the PhoeniX platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/why-the-saab-9-3-phoenix-may-not-be-dead-after-all-461175829 |title=Why The Saab 9-3 Phoenix May Not Be Dead After All |last=George |first=Patrick |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEVS was focusing its efforts on producing an electric variant of the second generation 9-3.

[[File:Solar irradiance spectrum 1992.gif|thumb|Solar irradiance spectrum at top of atmosphere, on a linear scale and plotted against [[wavenumber]].]]

The '''solar constant''' ('''''G&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;''''') is a [[flux density]] measuring mean [[Sun|solar]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] (solar irradiance) per unit area. It is measured on a surface perpendicular to the rays, one [[astronomical unit|astronomical unit (AU)]] from the Sun (roughly the distance from the Sun to the Earth).

The solar constant includes all types of [[solar radiation]], not just the [[visible light]]. It is measured by satellite as being 1.361 [[Kilo-|kilo]][[watt]]s per square meter (kW/m²) at solar minimum and approximately 0.1% greater (roughly 1.362&amp;nbsp;kW/m²) at [[solar maximum]].&lt;ref name=KoppLean11&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kopp |first1= G. |last2= Lean |first2= J. L. |doi= 10.1029/2010GL045777 |title= A new, lower value of total solar irradiance: Evidence and climate significance |journal= Geophysical Research Letters |volume= 38 |pages= n/a |year= 2011 |pmid= |pmc= |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL045777/pdf| format= PDF|bibcode= 2011GeoRL..38.1706K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solar "constant" is not a [[physical constant]] in the modern [[CODATA]] scientific sense; that is, it is not like the [[Planck constant]] or the [[speed of light]] which are absolutely constant in physics. The solar constant is an average of a varying value. In the past 400 years it has varied less than 0.2 percent.&lt;ref name=sorce&gt;http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/data/tsi-data/ Total Solar Irradiance Data, [[SORCE]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This constant is used in the calculation of [[radiation pressure]], which aids in the calculation of a force on a [[solar sail]].

==Calculation==

[[Solar irradiance]] is measured by satellite above [[Earth's atmosphere]],&lt;ref name=TSI20&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acrim.com/TSI%20Monitoring.htm|title=Satellite observations of total solar irradiance|author=|date=|website=acrim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is then adjusted using the [[inverse square law]] to infer the magnitude of solar irradiance at one [[Astronomical Unit]] (AU) to evaluate the solar constant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/SOLAR/ftpsolarirradiance.html&lt;/ref&gt; The approximate average value cited,&lt;ref name=KoppLean11/&gt; 1.3608 ± 0.0005 &amp;nbsp;kW/m², which is 81.65 kJ/m² per minute, is equivalent to approximately 1.951 calories per minute per square centimeter, or 1.951 [[Langley (unit)|langleys]] per minute.

Solar output is nearly, but not quite, constant. Variations in [[total solar irradiance]] (TSI) were small and difficult to detect accurately with technology available before the satellite era (±2% in 1954). Total solar output is now measured as varying (over the last three 11-year [[sunspot]] cycles) by approximately 0.1%;&lt;ref name=Willson91&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willson |first=Richard C.|author2=H.S. Hudson|date=1991 |title=The Sun's luminosity over a complete solar cycle |journal=Nature |volume=351 |issue=6321 |pages=42–4 |doi=10.1038/351042a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v351/n6321/abs/351042a0.html |ref=harv |bibcode=1991Natur.351...42W}}&lt;!-- {{harvnb|Willson|1991}} --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; see [[solar variation]] for details.

==Historical measurements==
In 1838, [[Claude Pouillet]] made the first estimate of the solar constant. Using a very simple [[pyrheliometer]] he developed, he obtained a value of 1.228&amp;nbsp;kW/m²,&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/16943/meteo_2008_60_36.pdf'' The measurement of the solar constant by Claude Pouillet''], by J-L Dufresne, [http://www.smf.asso.fr/lameteo.html ''La Météorologie''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305140149/http://www.smf.asso.fr/lameteo.html |date=2010-03-05}}, No. 60, pp. 36-43, Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; close to the current estimate.

In 1875, [[Jules Violle]] resumed the work of Pouillet and offered a somewhat larger estimate of 1.7&amp;nbsp;kW/m² based, in part, on a measurement that he made from [[Mont Blanc]] in France.

In 1884, [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] attempted to estimate the solar constant from [[Mount Whitney]] in California. By taking readings at different times of day, he tried to correct for effects due to atmospheric absorption. However, the final value he proposed, 2.903&amp;nbsp;kW/m², was much too large.

[[File:Solar radiation Langley 1903.png|thumb|A 1903 Langley bolograph with an erroneous solar constant of 2.54 calories/minute/square centimeter.]] Between 1902 and 1957, measurements by [[Charles Greeley Abbot]] and others at various high-altitude sites found values between 1.322 and 1.465&amp;nbsp;kW/m². Abbot showed that one of Langley's corrections was erroneously applied. Abbot's results varied between 1.89 and 2.22 calories (1.318 to 1.548&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;kW/m²), a variation that appeared to be due to the Sun and not the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Sun |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 the solar constant was evaluated as 2.00 cal/min/sq cm ± 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469%281954%29011%3C0431%3ATSC%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |title=The Solar Constant |author=Francis S. Johnson |journal= Journal of Meteorology |volume=11 |number=6 |date=December 1954 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1954)011&lt;0431:TSC&gt;2.0.CO;2 |pages=431–439|bibcode= 1954JAtS...11..432J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current results are about 2.5 percent lower.

==Relationship to other measurements==

===Solar irradiance===
{{Main|Solar irradiance}}
{{See also|Earth's energy budget}}
The actual direct solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere fluctuates by about 6.9% during a year (from 1.412&amp;nbsp;kW/m² in early January to 1.321&amp;nbsp;kW/m² in early July) due to the Earth's varying distance from the Sun, and typically by much less than 0.1% from day to day. Thus, for the whole [[Earth]] (which has a [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of 127,400,000&amp;nbsp;km²), the power is 1.730×10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[watt|W]] (or 173,000 [[terawatt]]s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|date=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus or minus 3.5% (half the approximately 6.9% annual range). The solar constant does not remain constant over long periods of time (see [[Solar variation]]), but over a year the solar constant varies much less than the solar irradiance measured at the top of the atmosphere. This is because the solar constant is evaluated at a fixed distance of 1 [[Astronomical Unit]] (AU) while the solar irradiance will be affected by the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the Earth's orbit. Its distance to the Sun varies annually between 147.1·10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; km at [[aphelion]] and 152.1·10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km at [[perihelion]].

The Earth receives a total amount of radiation determined by its cross section (π·R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;²), but as it rotates this energy is distributed across the entire [[surface area]] (4·π·R&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;²). Hence the average incoming solar radiation, taking into account the angle at which the rays strike and that at any one moment half the planet does not receive any solar radiation, is one-fourth the solar constant (approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m²). The amount reaching the Earth's surface (as [[insolation]]) is further reduced by atmospheric attenuation, which varies. At any given moment, the amount of solar radiation received at a location on the Earth's surface depends on the state of the atmosphere, the location's [[latitude]], and the time of day.

===Apparent magnitude===

The solar constant includes all wavelengths of solar electromagnetic radiation, not just the [[visible light]] (see [[Electromagnetic spectrum]]). It is positively correlated with the [[apparent magnitude]] of the Sun which is &amp;minus;26.8. The solar constant and the magnitude of the Sun are two methods of describing the apparent brightness of the Sun, though the magnitude is based on the Sun's visual output only.

===The Sun's total radiation===
The [[angular diameter]] of the Earth as seen from the Sun is approximately 1/11,700 [[radian]]s (about 18 [[minute and second of arc|arcseconds]]), meaning the [[solid angle]] of the Earth as seen from the Sun is approximately 1/175,000,000 of a [[steradian]]. Thus the Sun emits about 2.2 billion times the amount of radiation that is caught by Earth, in other words about 3.86&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineplanets.org/sol.html|title=☀ The Sun - Educational facts and history of the star we call The Sun.|author=|date=|website=www.nineplanets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past variations in solar irradiance==
Space-based observations of solar irradiance started in 1978. These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant. It varies with the 11-year sunspot [[solar cycle]].
When going further back in time, one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions, using sunspots for the past 400 years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back 10,000 years.
Such reconstructions show that solar irradiance varies with distinct periodicities. These cycles are: 11 years (Schwabe), 88 years (Gleisberg cycle), 208 years (DeVries cycle) and 1,000 years (Eddy cycle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wang |display-authors= etal |year= 2005 |title= Modeling the Sun's Magnetic Field and Irradiance since 1713| url= |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 625 |issue= 1| pages= 522–538 |doi= 10.1086/429689 |bibcode=2005ApJ...625..522W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinhilber et al.

Over billions of years, the Sun is gradually expanding, and emitting more energy from the resultant larger surface area. The unsolved question of how to account for the clear geological evidence of liquid water on the Earth billions of years ago, at a time when the sun's luminosity was only 70% of its current value, is known as the [[faint young Sun paradox]].

==Variations due to atmospheric conditions==
At most about 75% of the solar energy actually reaches the earth's surface,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.uni-jena.de/Teaching/Praktikum/pra2002/node68.html Reimann, Hans-Georg; Weiprecht, Juergen ''Kompendium für das Astronomische Praktikum'']&lt;/ref&gt; as even with a cloudless sky it is partially reflected and absorbed by the atmosphere. Even light cirrus clouds reduce this to 50%, stronger cirrus clouds to 40%. Thus the solar energy arriving at the surface can vary from 550&amp;nbsp;W/m² with cirrus clouds to 1025&amp;nbsp;W/m² with a clear sky.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31117">In [[materials science]], the '''sol–gel''' process is a method for producing solid materials from small molecules. The method is used for the [[manufacturing|fabrication]] of [[metal oxide]]s, especially the oxides of [[silicon]] (Si) and [[titanium]] (Ti). The process involves conversion of monomers into a colloidal solution (''[[Sol (colloid)|sol]]'') that acts as the precursor for an integrated network (or ''[[gel|gel]]'') of either discrete particles or network [[polymer]]s. Typical [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] are [[metal alkoxide]]s.

==Stages in the process==
[[File:SolGelTechnologyStages.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the different stages and routes of the sol–gel technology]]
In this chemical procedure, a "[[Sol (colloid)|sol]]" (a colloidal solution) is formed that then gradually evolves towards the formation of a gel-like diphasic system containing both a [[liquid]] phase and [[solid]] phase whose morphologies range from discrete particles to continuous polymer networks. In the case of the [[colloid]], the volume fraction of particles (or particle density) may be so low that a significant amount of fluid may need to be removed initially for the gel-like properties to be recognized. This can be accomplished in any number of ways. The simplest method is to allow time for [[sedimentation]] to occur, and then pour off the remaining liquid. [[Centrifugation]] can also be used to accelerate the process of [[phase separation]].

Removal of the remaining liquid (solvent) phase requires a '''drying''' process, which is typically accompanied by a significant amount of [[shrinkage (casting)|shrinkage]] and densification. The rate at which the solvent can be removed is ultimately determined by the distribution of [[porosity]] in the gel. The ultimate [[microstructure]] of the final component will clearly be strongly influenced by changes imposed upon the structural template during this phase of processing.

Afterwards, a thermal treatment, or '''firing''' process, is often necessary in order to favor further polycondensation and enhance mechanical properties and structural stability via final [[sintering]], densification, and [[grain growth]]. One of the distinct advantages of using this methodology as opposed to the more traditional processing techniques is that densification is often achieved at a much lower temperature.

The [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] sol can be either deposited on a [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]] to form a film (e.g., by [[dip-coating]] or [[spin coating]]), [[casting|cast]] into a suitable container with the desired shape (e.g., to obtain monolithic [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]]es, [[mineral wool|fibers]], [[artificial membrane|membranes]], [[aerogel]]s), or used to synthesize powders (e.g., [[microsphere]]s, [[nanoparticle|nanospheres]]).&lt;ref name="hydro"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Hanaor| first1 = D.

Even small quantities of dopants, such as [[dye#Organic dyes|organic dye]]s and [[rare-earth element]]s, can be introduced in the sol and end up uniformly dispersed in the final product. It can be used in [[ceramics processing]] and manufacturing as an [[investment casting]] material, or as a means of producing very [[thin film]]s of metal [[oxide]]s for various purposes. Sol–gel derived materials have diverse applications in [[optics]], [[electronics]], [[energy]], [[space]], (bio)[[sensors]], [[medicine]] (e.g., [[sustained release dosage forms|controlled drug release]]), [[reactive material]], and separation (e.g., [[chromatography]]) technology.

The interest in sol–gel processing can be traced back in the mid-1800s with the observation that the hydrolysis of [[tetraethyl orthosilicate]] (TEOS) under acidic conditions led to the formation of [[silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the form of fibers and monoliths. Sol–gel research grew to be so important that in the 1990s more than 35,000 papers were published worldwide on the process.&lt;ref name="CJ"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. J. |last=Brinker |author2=G. W.

==Particles and polymers==
The sol–gel process is a wet-chemical technique used for the fabrication of both glassy and ceramic materials. In this process, the sol (or solution) evolves gradually towards the formation of a gel-like network containing both a liquid phase and a solid phase. Typical precursors are metal alkoxides and metal chlorides, which undergo hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions to form a colloid. The basic structure or morphology of the solid phase can range anywhere from discrete colloidal particles to continuous chain-like polymer networks.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, L.C. and Garvey, G.J., "Kinetics of the Sol-Gel Transition"
Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, Vol. 38, p.45 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinker, C.J., ''et al.'', "Sol-Gel Transition in Simple Silicates", J. Non-Crystalline Solids, Vol.48, p.47 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[colloid]]'' is used primarily to describe a broad range of solid-liquid (and/or liquid-liquid) mixtures, all of which contain distinct solid (and/or liquid) particles which are dispersed to various degrees in a liquid medium. The term is specific to the size of the individual particles, which are larger than atomic dimensions but small enough to exhibit [[Brownian motion]]. If the particles are large enough, then their dynamic behavior in any given period of time in suspension would be governed by forces of [[gravity]] and [[sedimentation]]. But if they are small enough to be colloids, then their irregular motion in suspension can be attributed to the collective bombardment of a myriad of thermally agitated molecules in the liquid suspending medium, as described originally by [[Albert Einstein]] in his [[dissertation]]. Einstein concluded that this erratic behavior could adequately be described using the theory of [[Brownian motion]], with sedimentation being a possible long-term result. This critical size range (or particle diameter) typically ranges from tens of [[angstrom]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m) to a few [[micrometre]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A., Ann. Phys., Vol. 19, p. 289 (1906), Vol. 34 p.591 (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Under certain chemical conditions (typically in '''base-catalyzed sols'''), the particles may grow to sufficient size to become '''colloids''', which are affected both by sedimentation and forces of gravity. Stabilized suspensions of such sub-micrometre spherical particles may eventually result in their self-assembly—yielding highly ordered microstructures reminiscent of the prototype colloidal crystal: precious [[opal]].&lt;ref name="A1"&gt;Allman III, R.M., ''Structural Variations in Colloidal Crystals'', M.S. Thesis, UCLA (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A2"&gt;Allman III, R.M. and Onoda, G.Y., Jr. (Unpublished work, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Under certain chemical conditions (typically in '''acid-catalyzed sols'''), the interparticle forces have sufficient strength to cause considerable aggregation and/or [[flocculation]] prior to their growth. The formation of a more open continuous network of low density '''polymers''' exhibits certain advantages with regard to physical properties in the formation of high performance glass and glass/ceramic components in 2 and 3 dimensions.&lt;ref name=SAK&gt;Sakka, S. ''et al.'', "The Sol-Gel Transition: Formation of Glass Fibers &amp; Thin Films", J. Non-Crystalline Solids, Vol. 48, p.31 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

In either case (discrete particles or continuous polymer network) the [[sol (colloid)|sol]] evolves then towards the formation of an inorganic network containing a liquid phase ([[gel]]). Formation of a metal oxide involves connecting the metal centers with oxo (M-O-M) or hydroxo (M-OH-M) bridges, therefore generating metal-oxo or metal-hydroxo polymers in solution.

In both cases (discrete particles or continuous polymer network), the drying process serves to remove the liquid phase from the gel, yielding a micro-porous [[amorphous]] glass or micro-crystalline ceramic. Subsequent thermal treatment (firing) may be performed in order to favor further polycondensation and enhance mechanical properties.

With the viscosity of a sol adjusted into a proper range, both optical quality [[fiberglass|glass fiber]] and refractory ceramic fiber can be drawn which are used for fiber optic sensors and [[thermal insulation]], respectively. In addition, uniform ceramic powders of a wide range of chemical composition can be formed by [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]].

==Polymerization==
[[File:SolGelCartoon.png|thumb|Simplified representation of the condensation of TEOS in sol gel process]]
The [[Stöber process]] is a well-studied example of polymerization of an alkoxide, specifically [[tetraethyl orthosilicate|TEOS]]. The chemical formula for TEOS is given by Si(OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, where the [[alkyl]] group R = [[ethanol|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Alkoxides]] are ideal chemical precursors for sol–gel synthesis because they react readily with water. The reaction is called hydrolysis, because a [[hydroxyl]] ion becomes attached to the silicon atom as follows:
:Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HO−Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + R−OH

Depending on the amount of water and catalyst present, hydrolysis may proceed to completion to silica:
:Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 R−OH

Complete [[hydrolysis]] often requires an excess of water and/or the use of a hydrolysis [[catalyst]] such as [[acetic acid]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]. Intermediate species including [(OR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;−Si−(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] or [(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−Si−(OH)] may result as products of partial [[hydrolysis]] reactions.&lt;ref name="hydro"/&gt; Early intermediates result from two partially [[hydrolyzed]] [[monomer]]s linked with a [[siloxane]] [Si−O−Si] bond:
:(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−Si−OH + HO−Si−(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → [(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si−O−Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] + H−O−H

or
:(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;−Si−OR + HO−Si−(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → [(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si−O−Si(OR)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] + R−OH

Thus, [[polymerization]] is associated with the formation of a 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional network of [[siloxane]] [Si−O−Si] bonds accompanied by the production of H−O−H and R−O−H species.

By definition, condensation liberates a small molecule, such as water or [[alcohol]]. This type of reaction can continue to build larger and larger silicon-containing molecules by the process of polymerization. Thus, a polymer is a huge molecule (or [[macromolecule]]) formed from hundreds or thousands of units called [[monomer]]s. The number of bonds that a monomer can form is called its functionality. Polymerization of [[silicon alkoxide]], for instance, can lead to complex [[branching (polymer chemistry)|branching]] of the polymer, because a fully hydrolyzed monomer Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is tetrafunctional (can branch or bond in 4 different directions). Alternatively, under certain conditions (e.g., low water concentration) fewer than 4 of the OR or OH groups ([[ligand]]s) will be capable of condensation, so relatively little branching will occur. The mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation, and the factors that bias the structure toward linear or branched structures are the most critical issues of sol–gel science and technology. This reaction is favored in both basic and acidic conditions.

==Sono-Ormosil==
[[Sonication]] is an efficient tool for the synthesis of polymers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hielscher.com/ultrasonics/sonochem_01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cavitation]]al [[shear stress|shear]] forces, which stretch out and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the [[molecular weight]] and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and [[emulsion|emulsified]], so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that [[ultrasound]] increases the rate of [[polymerisation]] over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities. [[Ormosil]]s (organically modified silicate) are obtained when [[silane]] is added to gel-derived [[silica]] during sol–gel process. The product is a molecular-scale composite with improved mechanical properties. Sono-Ormosils are characterized by a higher [[density]] than classic gels as well as an improved thermal stability. An explanation therefore might be the increased degree of polymerization.&lt;ref&gt;Rosa-Fox, N. de la; Pinero, M.; Esquivias, L. (2002): Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Materials from Sonogels. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pechini Process==
For single cation systems like SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, hydrolylsis and condensation processes naturally give rise to homogenous compositions. For systems involving multiple cations, such as [[Strontium titanate| strontium titante]], SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and other [[perovskite]] systems, the concept of steric immobilisation becomes relevant. To avoid the formation of multiple phases of binary oxides as the result of differing hydrolysis and condensation rates, the entrapment of cations in a polymer network is an effective approach, generally termed the Pechini Process &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last1=Nishio |first1=Keishi |last2=Tsuchiya|first2=Tsuchiya |editor-last=Sakka |editor-first=JSumio |title= Handbook of Sol-Gel Science and Technology, Processing Characterisation and Applicatons |publisher=Kluwer Academic | pages=59–66 |chapter=Chapter 3 Sol–Gel Processing of Thin Films with Metal Salts:  }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this process, a [[chelating]] agent is used, most often citric acid, to surround aqueous cations and sterically entrap them. Subsequently a polymer network is formed to immobilize the chelated cations in a gel or resin. This is most often achieved by poly-esterification using [[ethylene glycol]]. The resulting polymer is then combusted under oxidising conditions to remove organic content and yield a product oxide with homogeneously dispersed cations.&lt;ref name= “pechini”&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Chen |first1= W. |last2=''et al''. |title= Enhancement of Ce/Cr Codopant Solubility and Chemical Homogeneity in TiO2 Nanoparticles through Sol–Gel versus Pechini Syntheses |journal= Inorganic Chemistry |year=2018 |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages= 7279-7289 |doi= 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.8b00926 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanomaterials==
[[File:Gel SAXS reconstruction.png |thumb |Nanostructure of a resorcinol-formaldehyde gel reconstructed from [[small-angle X-ray scattering]]. This type of disordered morphology is typical of many sol–gel materials.&lt;ref&gt;Gommes, C. J., Roberts A.

Physical Review E, 77, 041409.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the processing of fine [[ceramic]]s, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing [[density]] variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled [[flocculation]] of powders due to attractive [[van der Waals forces]] can also give rise to microstructural heterogeneities.&lt;ref&gt;Onoda, G. Y. and Hench, L. L., Ceramic Processing Before Firing (Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aksay, I. A., Lange, F. F., Davis, B. I.|journal=J. Am. Ceram.

Differential stresses that develop as a result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at which the [[solvent]] can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of [[porosity]]. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Franks, G. V. |author2=Lange, F. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=J. Am. Ceram.

In addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is prepared for the [[kiln]] are often amplified during the [[sintering]] process, yielding heterogeneous densification.
Some pores and other structural defects associated with density variations have been shown to play a detrimental role in the sintering process by growing and thus limiting end-point densities. Differential stresses arising from heterogeneous densification have also been shown to result in the propagation of internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Evans, A.

It would therefore appear desirable to process a material in such a way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions which will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over particle-particle interactions. [[Monodisperse]] colloids provide this potential.&lt;ref name="A1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allman III, R. M. in ''Microstructural Control Through Colloidal Consolidation'', Aksay, I. A., Adv. Ceram., Vol. 9, p. 94, Proc. Amer. Ceramic Soc. (Columbus, OH 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

Monodisperse powders of [[colloid]]al silica, for example, may therefore be stabilized sufficiently to ensure a high degree of order in the [[colloidal crystal]] or [[polycrystalline]] colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline structures would appear to be the basic elements of nanoscale materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in inorganic systems such as sintered ceramic nanomaterials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Molecular Self-Assembly and Nanochemistry: A Chemical Strategy for the Synthesis of Nanostructures | journal=Science | volume=254 | year=1991 | doi=10.1126/science.1962191 | pmid=1962191 | bibcode=1991Sci...254.1312W | issue=5036 | pages=1312–9 | last2=Mathias | last3=Seto | last1=Whitesides | first1=G.

==Applications==

===Protective coatings===
The applications for sol gel-derived products are numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J. D. and Sommerdijk, N. A. J. M., Sol-Gel Materials: Chemistry and Applications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aegerter, M. A. and Mennig, M., Sol-Gel Technologies for Glass Producers and Users.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phalippou, J., Sol-Gel: A Low temperature Process for the Materials of the New Millennium, solgel.com (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinker, C. J. and Scherer, G. W., Sol-Gel Science: The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing, (Academic Press, 1990) {{ISBN|9780121349707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German Patent 736411 (Granted 6 May 1943) Anti-Reflective Coating (W. Geffcken and E. Berger, Jenaer Glasswerk Schott).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, L. C., Sol-Gel Optics: Processing and Applications, Springer Verlag (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, scientists have used it to produce the world’s lightest materials and also some of its [[toughness|toughest]] ceramics. One of the largest application areas is thin films, which can be produced on a piece of substrate by [[spin coating]] or dip-coating. Protective and decorative coatings, and electro-optic components can be applied to glass, metal and other types of substrates with these methods. Cast into a mold, and with further drying and heat-treatment, dense ceramic or glass articles with novel properties can be formed that cannot be created by any other method. Other coating methods include spraying, [[electrophoresis]], [[inkjet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yakovlev|first1=Aleksandr V.|title=Inkjet Color Printing by Interference Nanostructures|journal=ACS Nano|date=22 March 2016|volume=10|issue=3|pages=3078–3086 |doi=10.1021/acsnano.5b06074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yakovlev|first1=Aleksandr V.|title=Sol-Gel Assisted Inkjet Hologram Patterning|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|date=December 2015|volume=25|issue=47|pages=7375–7380|doi=10.1002/adfm.201503483}}&lt;/ref&gt; printing, or roll coating.

===Thin films and fibers===
With the [[viscosity]] of a sol adjusted into a proper range, both [[optical fiber|optical]] and [[refractory ceramic]] fibers can be drawn which are used for fiber optic sensors and thermal insulation, respectively. Thus, many ceramic materials, both [[glass]]y and crystalline, have found use in various forms from bulk solid-state components to high surface area forms such as thin films, coatings and fibers.&lt;ref name=SAK/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patel, P.J., ''et al.'', (2000) "Transparent ceramics for armor and EM window applications", Proc. SPIE, Vol. 4102, p. 1, '''Inorganic Optical Materials II''', Marker, A.J. and Arthurs, E.G., Eds.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoscale powders===
Ultra-fine and uniform ceramic powders can be formed by precipitation. These powders of single and multiple component compositions can be produced on a nanoscale particle size for dental and [[biomedical]] applications. Composite powders have been patented for use as [[agrochemical]]s and [[herbicide]]s. Powder [[abrasives]], used in a variety of finishing operations, are made using a sol–gel type process. One of the more important applications of sol–gel processing is to carry out [[zeolite]] synthesis. Other elements (metals, metal oxides) can be easily incorporated into the final product and the silicate sol formed by this method is very stable.

Another application in research is to entrap [[biomolecule]]s for sensory ([[biosensor]]s) or catalytic purposes, by physically or chemically preventing them from leaching out and, in the case of [[protein]] or chemically-linked [[small molecule]]s, by shielding them from the external environment yet allowing small molecules to be monitored. The major disadvantages are that the change in local environment may alter the functionality of the protein or small molecule entrapped and that the synthesis step may damage the protein. To circumvent this, various strategies have been explored, such as monomers with protein friendly leaving groups (e.g. [[glycerol]]) and the inclusion of polymers which stabilize protein (e.g. [[polyethylene glycol|PEG]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Entrapment of biomolecules in sol-gel matrix for applications in biosensors: problems and future prospects|author=Gupta R, Chaudhury NK|journal=Biosens Bioelectron|year=2007|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2387–99|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2006.12.025|pmid=17291744|last2=Chaudhury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other products fabricated with this process include various ceramic membranes for [[microfiltration]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[nanofiltration]], [[pervaporation]], and [[reverse osmosis]]. If the liquid in a wet gel is removed under a [[critical point (chemistry)|supercritical]] condition, a highly porous and extremely low density material called aerogel is obtained. Drying the gel by means of low temperature treatments (25-100&amp;nbsp;°C), it is possible to obtain porous solid matrices called [[gel#Xerogels|xerogels]]. In addition, a sol–gel process was developed in the 1950s for the production of [[radioactive]] powders of [[uranium dioxide|UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[thorium dioxide|ThO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] for [[nuclear fuel]]s, without generation of large quantities of dust.

===Opto-mechanical===
Macroscopic [[optical]] elements and active optical components as well as large area [[hot mirror]]s, [[cold mirror]]s, [[lens (optics)|lenses]], and [[beam splitter]]s all with optimal geometry can be made quickly and at low cost via the sol–gel route. In the processing of high performance ceramic nanomaterials with superior opto-mechanical properties under adverse conditions, the size of the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline particles present in the raw material during the synthesis or formation of the object. Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (~500&amp;nbsp;nm) eliminates much of the [[light scattering]], resulting in a translucent or even [[transparent material]].

Furthermore, results indicate that microscopic pores in sintered ceramic nanomaterials, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline grains, cause light to scatter and prevented true transparency. it has been observed that the total volume fraction of these nanoscale pores (both intergranular and intragranular porosity) must be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission. I.E. The density has to be 99.99% of the theoretical crystalline density.&lt;ref name="Yoldas1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prochazka1983"/&gt;

A '''spring''' is an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] object that stores [[Mechanical energy storage|mechanical energy]]. Springs are typically made of [[spring steel]]. There are many spring designs. In everyday use, the term often refers to [[coil spring]]s.

When a conventional spring, without stiffness variability features, is compressed or stretched from its resting position, it exerts an opposing [[force]] approximately proportional to its change in length (this approximation breaks down for larger deflections). The ''rate'' or ''spring constant'' of a spring is the change in the force it exerts, divided by the change in [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of the spring. That is, it is the [[gradient]] of the force versus deflection [[curve]]. An [[tension (physics)|extension]] or [[compression (physical)|compression]] spring's rate is expressed in units of force divided by distance, for example or N/m or lbf/in. A [[torsion spring]] is a spring that works by twisting; when it is twisted about its axis by an angle, it produces a [[torque]] proportional to the angle. A torsion spring's rate is in units of torque divided by angle, such as [[newton metre|N·m]]/[[radian|rad]] or [[ft·lbf]]/degree. The inverse of spring rate is compliance, that is: if a spring has a rate of 10 N/mm, it has a compliance of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm/N. The stiffness (or rate) of springs in parallel is [[additive map|additive]], as is the compliance of springs in series.

Springs are made from a variety of elastic materials, the most common being spring steel. Small springs can be wound from pre-hardened stock, while larger ones are made from [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] steel and hardened after fabrication. Some [[non-ferrous metal]]s are also used including [[phosphor bronze]] and [[titanium]] for parts requiring corrosion resistance and [[beryllium copper]] for springs carrying electrical current (because of its low electrical resistance).

==History==
Simple non-coiled springs were used throughout human history, e.g. the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] (and arrow). In the Bronze Age more sophisticated spring devices were used, as shown by the spread of [[tweezers]] in many cultures. [[Ctesibius of Alexandria]] developed a method for making [[bronze]] with spring-like characteristics by producing an alloy of bronze with an increased proportion of tin, and then hardening it by hammering after it was cast.

[[Coiled springs]] appeared early in the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Springs.html Springs] How Products Are Made, 14 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in door locks.&lt;ref name="White1966" &gt;{{Cite book

In 1676 British physicist [[Robert Hooke]] postulated [[Hooke's law]], which states that the force a spring exerts is proportional to its extension.

Springs can be classified depending on how the load force is applied to them:
*'''Tension/extension spring''' – the spring is designed to operate with a [[tension (physics)|tension]] load, so the spring stretches as the load is applied to it.
*'''Compression spring''' – is designed to operate with a compression load, so the spring gets shorter as the load is applied to it.
*'''[[Torsion spring]]''' – unlike the above types in which the load is an axial force, the load applied to a torsion spring is a [[torque]] or twisting force, and the end of the spring rotates through an angle as the load is applied.
*'''Constant spring''' – supported load remains the same throughout deflection cycle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipingtech.com/products/constant-springs.htm Constant Springs] Piping Technology and Products, (retrieved March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Variable spring''' – resistance of the coil to load varies during compression&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pipingtech.com/products/variable-springs.htm Variable Spring Supports] Piping Technology and Products, (retrieved March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Variable stiffness spring''' – resistance of the coil to load can be dynamically varied for example by the control system,some types of these springs also vary their length thereby providing actuation capability as well &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2017077541A9/en|title=Springs with dynamically variable stiffness and actuation capability|author=|date=3 November 2016|website=google.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They can also be classified based on their shape:
*'''Flat spring''' – this type is made of a flat [[spring steel]].
*'''Machined spring''' – this type of spring is manufactured by machining bar stock with a lathe and/or milling operation rather than a coiling operation. Since it is machined, the spring may incorporate features in addition to the elastic element. Machined springs can be made in the typical load cases of compression/extension, torsion, etc.
*'''Serpentine spring''' – a zig-zag of thick wire – often used in modern upholstery/furniture.
*'''[[Garter spring]] - A coiled steel spring that is connected at each end to create a circular shape.
The most common types of spring are:
* '''[[springboard|Cantilever spring]]''' – a spring fixed only at one end.
* '''Coil spring''' or '''[[helix|helical]] spring''' – a spring (made by winding a wire around a cylinder) is of two types:
** ''Tension'' or ''extension springs'' are designed to become longer under load. Their turns (loops) are normally touching in the unloaded position, and they have a hook, eye or some other means of attachment at each end.
** ''Compression springs'' are designed to become shorter when loaded. Their turns (loops) are not touching in the unloaded position, and they need no attachment points.
** ''Hollow tubing springs'' can be either extension springs or compression springs. Hollow tubing is filled with oil and the means of changing hydrostatic pressure inside the tubing such as a membrane or miniature piston etc. to harden or relax the spring, much like it happens with water pressure inside a garden hose. Alternatively tubing's cross-section is chosen of a shape that it changes its area when tubing is subjected to torsional deformation – change of the cross-section area translates into change of tubing's inside volume and the flow of oil in/out of the spring that can be controlled by valve thereby controlling stiffness. There are many other designs of springs of hollow tubing which can change stiffness with any desired frequency, change stiffness by a multiple or move like a linear actuator in addition to its spring qualities.
* '''[[Volute spring]]''' – a compression coil spring in the form of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] so that under compression the coils are not forced against each other, thus permitting longer travel.
* '''Hairspring''' or '''[[balance spring]]''' – a delicate spiral spring used in [[watch]]es, [[galvanometer]]s, and places where electricity must be carried to partially rotating devices such as [[steering wheel]]s without hindering the rotation.
* '''[[Leaf spring]]''' – a flat spring used in vehicle [[suspension (vehicle)|suspensions]], electrical [[switch]]es, and [[bow (weapon)|bows]].
* '''V-spring''' – used in antique [[firearm]] mechanisms such as the [[wheellock]], [[flintlock]] and [[percussion cap]] locks. Also door-lock spring, as used in antique door latch mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springmasters.com/sp/door-lock-springs.html|title=Door Lock Springs|author=|date=|website=www.springmasters.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types include :
* '''[[Belleville washer]]''' or '''Belleville spring''' – a disc shaped spring commonly used to apply tension to a bolt (and also in the initiation mechanism of pressure-activated [[land mine|landmines]])
* '''[[Constant-force spring]]''' — a tightly rolled ribbon that exerts a nearly constant force as it is unrolled
* '''[[Gas spring]]''' – a volume of compressed gas
* '''Ideal Spring''' – a notional spring used in physics—it has no weight, mass, or damping losses. The force exerted by the spring is proportional to the distance the spring is stretched or compressed from its relaxed position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.physics.buffalo.edu/phy101ab/Section_B/Lect21/Lect21.pdf|title = Ideal Spring and Simple Harmonic Motion|date = |access-date = 2016-01-11|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mainspring]]''' – a spiral ribbon shaped spring used as a power store in [[clockwork]] mechanisms: [[watch]]es, [[clock]]s, [[music box]]es, windup [[toy]]s, and [[mechanically powered flashlight]]s
* '''[[Constant-force spring|Negator spring]]''' – a thin metal band slightly concave in cross-section. When coiled it adopts a flat cross-section but when unrolled it returns to its former curve, thus producing a constant force throughout the displacement and ''negating'' any tendency to re-wind. The most common application is the retracting steel tape rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Samuel|first= Andrew|author2=Weir, John |title=Introduction to engineering design: modelling, synthesis and problem solving strategies|publisher=Butterworth|location=Oxford, England|year=1999|edition=2|page=134|isbn=0-7506-4282-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Progressive rate coil springs''' – A coil spring with a variable rate, usually achieved by having unequal [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|pitch]] so that as the spring is compressed one or more coils rests against its neighbour.
* '''[[Rubber band]]''' – a tension spring where energy is stored by stretching the material.
* '''Spring [[Washer (mechanical)|washer]]''' – used to apply a constant tensile force along the axis of a [[fastener]].
* '''[[Torsion spring]]''' – any spring designed to be twisted rather than compressed or extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eMqVygLDSa0C&amp;pg=PA577|title=Technical Drawing|last=Goetsch|first=David L.|date=2005|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-4018-5760-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in [[Torsion beam suspension|torsion bar]] vehicle suspension systems.
* '''[[Wave spring]]''' – any of many wave shaped springs, washers, and expanders, including linear springs—all of which are generally made with flat wire or discs that are ''[[marcel wave|''marcelled]]'' according to industrial terms, usually by die-stamping, into a wavy regular pattern resulting in curvilinear lobes. Round wire wave springs exist as well. Types include wave washer, single turn wave spring, multi-turn wave spring, linear wave spring, marcel expander, interlaced wave spring, and nested wave spring.

==Physics==
===Hooke's law===
{{Main|Hooke's law}}

As long as not stretched or compressed beyond their [[elastic limit]], most springs obey Hooke's law, which states that the force with which the spring pushes back is linearly proportional to the distance from its equilibrium length:
:&lt;math&gt; F=-kx, \ &lt;/math&gt;
where
: ''x'' is the displacement vector – the distance and direction the spring is deformed from its equilibrium length.
: ''F'' is the resulting force vector – the magnitude and direction of the restoring force the spring exerts
: ''k'' is the '''rate''', '''spring constant''' or '''force constant''' of the spring, a constant that depends on the spring's material and construction. The negative sign indicates that the force the spring exerts is in the opposite direction from its displacement

Coil springs and other common springs typically obey Hooke's law. There are useful springs that don't: springs based on beam bending can for example produce forces that vary [[nonlinear]]ly with displacement.

If made with constant pitch (wire thickness), [[conical springs]] have a variable rate. However, a conical spring can be made to have a constant rate by creating the spring with a variable pitch. A larger pitch in the larger-diameter coils and a smaller pitch in the smaller-diameter coils forces the spring to collapse or extend all the coils at the same rate when deformed.

===Simple harmonic motion===
{{Main|Harmonic oscillator}}
Since force is equal to mass, ''m'', times acceleration, ''a'', the force equation for a spring obeying Hooke's law looks like:
:&lt;math&gt;F = m a \quad \Rightarrow \quad -k x = m a. \,&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Periodampwave.svg|thumb|right|280px|The displacement, ''x'', as a function of time. The amount of time that passes between peaks is called the [[Wave period|period]].]]
The mass of the spring is small in comparison to the mass of the attached mass and is ignored. Since acceleration is simply the second [[derivative]] of x with respect to time,
:&lt;math&gt; - k x = m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
This is a second order linear [[differential equation]] for the displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time. Rearranging:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \frac{k}{m} x = 0, \,&lt;/math&gt;
the solution of which is the sum of a [[sine]] and [[cosine]]:
:&lt;math&gt; x(t) = A \sin \left(t \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \right) + B \cos \left(t \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \right). \, &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants that may be found by considering the initial displacement and velocity of the mass. The graph of this function with &lt;math&gt;B = 0&lt;/math&gt; (zero initial position with some positive initial velocity) is displayed in the image on the right.

==Theory==
In [[classical physics]], a spring can be seen as a device that stores [[potential energy]], specifically [[elastic potential energy]], by straining the bonds between the [[atom]]s of an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material.

Hooke's law of [[theory of elasticity|elasticity]] states that the extension of an elastic rod (its distended length minus its relaxed length) is linearly proportional to its [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]], the [[force]] used to stretch it. Similarly, the contraction (negative extension) is proportional to the [[compression (physical)|compression]] (negative tension).

This law actually holds only approximately, and only when the deformation (extension or contraction) is small compared to the rod's overall length. For deformations beyond the [[Tensile strength|elastic limit]], atomic bonds get broken or rearranged, and a spring may snap, buckle, or permanently deform. Many materials have no clearly defined elastic limit, and Hooke's law can not be meaningfully applied to these materials. Moreover, for the superelastic materials, the linear relationship between force and displacement is appropriate only in the low-strain region.

Hooke's law is a mathematical consequence of the fact that the potential energy of the rod is a minimum when it has its relaxed length. Any [[smooth function]] of one variable approximates a [[quadratic function]] when examined near enough to its minimum point as can be seen by examining the [[Taylor series]]. Therefore, the force—which is the derivative of energy with respect to displacement—approximates a [[linear function]].

Force of fully compressed spring

:&lt;math&gt; F_{max} = \frac{E d^4 (L-n d)}{16 (1+\nu) (D-d)^3 n} \ &lt;/math&gt;

where

: E – [[Young's modulus]]
: d – spring wire diameter
: L – free length of spring
: n – number of active windings
: &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; – [[Poisson ratio]]
: D – spring outer diameter

==Zero-length springs==
"Zero-length spring" is a term for a specially designed coil spring that would exert zero force if it had zero length; if there were no constraint due to the finite wire diameter of such a helical spring, it would have zero length in the unstretched condition. That is, in a line graph of the spring's force versus its length, the line passes through the origin. Obviously a coil spring cannot contract to zero length, because at some point the coils touch each other and the spring can't shorten any more. Zero length springs are made by manufacturing a coil spring with built-in tension (A twist is introduced into the wire as it is coiled during manufacture. This works because a coiled spring "unwinds" as it stretches.), so if it ''could'' contract further, the equilibrium point of the spring, the point at which its restoring force is zero, occurs at a length of zero. In practice, zero length springs are made by combining a "negative length" spring, made with even more tension so its equilibrium point would be at a "negative" length, with a piece of inelastic material of the proper length so the zero force point would occur at zero length.

A zero length spring can be attached to a mass on a hinged boom in such a way that the force on the mass is almost exactly balanced by the vertical component of the force from the spring, whatever the position of the boom. This creates a horizontal "pendulum" with very long oscillation [[period (physics)|period]]. Long-period pendulums enable [[seismometer]]s to sense the slowest waves from earthquakes. The [[Lucien LaCoste|LaCoste]] suspension with zero-length springs is also used in [[gravimeter]]s because it is very sensitive to changes in gravity. Springs for closing doors are often made to have roughly zero length, so that they exert force even when the door is almost closed, so they can hold it closed firmly.

'''Strategic energy management''' ('''SEM''') is a  set of processes for business [[energy management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://semhub.com/what-is-sem|website=semhub.com|accessdate=28 Aug 2017 |title=What Is SEM?}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEM is often deployed via programs that target the [[business]]es or other [[organization]]s within a utility [[territory]] or a [[government]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://library.cee1.org/system/files/library/12994/CEE_2016_Industrial_SEM_Program_Summary_Public.pdf |title=CEESM 2016 Strategic Energy Management Program Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEM is codified in the ISO 50001 standard for energy management systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwalliance.org/conference/sites/default/files/pdf/MES-2015_presentations_Sheaffer.pdf|website=mwalliance.org|accessdate=28 Aug 2017 |title= The Strategic Energy Management Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy benefits ==
The main goal of SEM is to help a [[company]] achieve continuous improvement in its [[energy performance]] over a longer-term period. Some energy benefits of SEM include reduced [[energy consumption]] through improved [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]] and [[energy conservation]], improved [[peak demand]] management and reduced demand charges, decreased overall energy cost, reduced energy costs, [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions and improved reliability through integration of [[distributed energy resources]] (e.g. onsite renewables, localized energy storage, combined heat and power), and improved electrical price stability and reduced GHG emissions through integration of long-term renewable energy contracts.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://neea.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/nw-industrial-sem-collaborative-overview.pdf?sfvrsn=2|website=neea.org|accessdate=28 Aug 2017 |title=Northwest Industrial Strategic Energy Management DEFINITION, GOALS AND SUCCESSES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-energy benefits ==
Although often focused on energy management, SEM also supports other goals, including: reducing downtime and increasing productivity through improved maintenance practices, reducing CO2 and other air emissions through reduced on-site fuel combustion (through efficiency or through beneficial electrification), and improved employee productivity through increased employee morale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2015/data/papers/1-194.pdf|website=aceee.org|accessdate=28 Aug 2017 |title=When Does Energy Management Become Strategic?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Core elements ==
Most companies take several years to develop all the elements of SEM. The core or minimum elements of SEM for achieving the goal and benefits just described include&lt;ref&gt;Consortium for Energy Efficiency, “CEE Strategic Energy Management Minimum Elements,” https://library.cee1.org/content/cee-strategic-energy-management-minimum-elements/&lt;/ref&gt; management commitment to long-term energy performance goals, energy planning and implementation, and system for measuring and reporting energy performance.

== Current activities ==
SEM Collaboratives
Regional SEM collaboratives have met in the Northwestern and Northeastern United States for several years, with interest expressed in other regions for similar collaborative forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neea.org/get-involved/northwest-industrial-sem-collaborative|website=neea.org|accessdate=28 Aug 2017 |title=Northwest SEM Collaborative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first North American SEM Summit was conducted in Denver Colorado on August 15, 2017, with representatives from across the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/conferences/2017/ssi|website=aceee.org|accessdate=28 Aug 2017 |title=2017 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common services ==
While organizations can implement SEM on their own, many have found value in leveraging SEM specialists or SEM-based programs.

===Private companies===
Private companies provide SEM-based services to their customers as a dedicated consulting engagement.  Other companies integrate SEM concepts into their more traditional energy engineering, energy planning, or energy project implementations.

===Energy utilities===
Energy utilities in the U.S. and Canada often deploy dedicated SEM programs or deploy SEM components within other programs. These utilities deploy SEM for multiple reasons increased energy savings to support utility Demand Side Management (DSM) goals, measured in electrical, gas, or other energy savings, increased customer motivation to pursue energy saving opportunities (with less required utility outreach/marketing), reduced peak demand to address constraints in generation and/or transmission/distribution, and increased long-term customer satisfaction

The target customers for these programs are typically larger organizations, often manufacturers or larger building environments such as hospitals, water utilities, and universities.

Some utility SEM programs work with customers on an individual basis, and some provide training and coaching to groups of companies, often referred to as cohorts. The cohort approach tends to be more cost-effective for the utility, since at least some of the coach/trainer’s time can serve several customers at once. In addition, the cohort can provide positive peer pressure for participants to take action and save more energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2015/data/papers/1-31.pdf|website=aceee.org|accessdate=28 Aug 2017 |title=The Second Generation of Strategic Energy Management Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government agencies===
Government agencies around the world often deploy SEM programs to drive adoption of ISO 50001, to increase competitiveness of the businesses within their borders, and/or to address climate priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/Blog/the-value-of-energy-management-systems-and-iso-50001-42890|website=cleanenergyministerial.org|accessdate=28 Aug 2017 |title=The Value of Energy Management Systems and ISO 50001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ISO 50001 ==
ISO 50001 codifies SEM by establishing universal requirements for management systems for energy (EnMSs).  ISO 50001 is aligned to other management system standards for quality and environmental impact.  It includes requirements for management participation, objectives, monitoring and measurement, and several other elements.

[[File:Vista_de_são_paulo_cantareira.jpg|thumb|[[São Paulo city]] seen from [[Serra da Cantareira]]]]
An '''urban forest'''  is a [[forest]] or a collection of trees that grow within a [[city]], [[town]] or a [[suburb]]. In a wider sense it may include any kind of woody plant vegetation growing in and around human settlements. In a narrower sense  (also called '''forest park''') it describes areas whose [[ecosystem]]s are inherited from wilderness leftovers or remnants. Care and management of urban forests is called '''urban forestry'''. Urban forests may be publicly-owned [[municipal forest]]s, but the latter may also be located outside of the town or city to which they belong&lt;ref&gt;Ranasinghe ,WC and Hemakumara, GPTS(2018),  Spatial modelling of the householders' perception and assessment of the potentiality to improve the urban green coverage in residential areas: A case study from Issadeen Town Matara, Sri Lanka, Ruhuna Journal of Science,Vol 9(1); http://rjs.ruh.ac.lk/index.php/rjs/article/view/174 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803074300/http://rjs.ruh.ac.lk/index.php/rjs/article/view/174 |date=2018-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Urban forests play an important role in [[ecology]] of human habitats in many ways: they filter air, water, sunlight, provide shelter to animals and recreational area for people.  They moderate local climate, slowing wind and stormwater, and shading homes and businesses to conserve energy. &lt;ref name="PowerOfStreetscape"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jiri Lev |date=2017 |title=The power of streetscape and how to protect it |url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/4889262/the-power-of-streetscape-and-how-to-protect-it/ |work=Newcastle Herald |location=Newcastle NSW Australia |access-date=2017-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903122019/http://www.theherald.com.au/story/4889262/the-power-of-streetscape-and-how-to-protect-it/ |archive-date=2017-09-03 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are critical in cooling the urban [[heat island]] effect, thus potentially reducing the number of unhealthful [[ozone]] days that plague major cities in peak summer months.

In many countries there is a growing understanding of the importance of the natural ecology in urban forests. There are numerous projects underway aimed at restoration and preservation of ecosystems, ranging from simple elimination of leaf-raking and elimination of invasive plants to full-blown reintroduction of original species and [[riparian]] ecosystems.

Some sources claim that the largest man-made urban forest in the world is located in [[Johannesburg]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="JHBforest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gauteng.net/guide/green_tourism/|title=Green tourism in Gauteng –  Gauteng Tourism Authority: Visit The Province Built On Gold|publisher=|access-date=2013-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516204212/http://www.gauteng.net/guide/green_tourism/|archive-date=2013-05-16|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JHBforest2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1553&amp;Itemid=201|title=city of Johannesburg - Joburg's urban forest to grow|publisher=|access-date=2013-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430002313/http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1553&amp;Itemid=201|archive-date=2015-04-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JHBforest3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/11/18/johannesburg.urban.forest/index.html|title=Johannesburg expands its urban forest|publisher=|access-date=2013-05-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219081401/http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/11/18/johannesburg.urban.forest/index.html|archive-date=2013-12-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;But others claim that this could be a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://africacheck.org/reports/is-johannesburg-the-worlds-largest-man-made-forest-the-claim-is-false/|title=Is Johannesburg the world’s largest man-made forest?

==Benefits==
[[File:Old Put fallen tree jeh.JPG|thumb|left|Forest has grown around an abandoned rail line in the city of [[Yonkers]]]]
{{Refimprove section|date = January 2012}}
The benefits of urban trees and shrubs are many, including beautification, reduction of the [[urban heat island]] effect, reduction of stormwater runoff, reduction of [[air pollution]], reduction of energy costs through increased shade over buildings, enhancement of property values, improved wildlife habitat, and mitigation of overall urban environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W.G. Wilson|year=2011|title=Constructed Climates: A primer on urban environments. |location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-90146-7|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social, psychological, recreational, wildlife===
The presence of trees reduces stress, and trees have long been seen to benefit the health of urban dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Healthy parks, healthy people: The health benefits of contact with nature in a park context|date=March 2008|publisher=Deakin University and Parks Victoria|first=Cecily|last=Maller|first2=Mardie|last2=Townsend|first3=Lawrence|last3=St Leger|url=http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/resources/mhphp/pv1.pdf|access-date=2009-12-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120204604/http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/resources/mhphp/pv1.pdf|archive-date=2010-01-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shade of trees and other urban green spaces make place for people to meet and socialize and play. The [[Biophilia hypothesis]] argues that people are instinctively drawn to nature, while [[Attention Restoration Theory]] goes on to demonstrate tangible improvements in medical, academic and other outcomes, from access to nature. Proper planning and community involvement are important for the positive results to be realized.

Trees and shrubs provide nesting sites and food for birds and other animals. People appreciate watching, feeding, photographing, and painting urban wildlife and the environment they live in.  Urban trees, shrubs and wildlife help people maintain their connection with nature.

===Economic benefits===
The economic benefits of trees and various other plants have been understood for a long time.  Recently, more of these benefits are becoming quantified.  Quantification of the economic benefits of trees helps justify public and private expenditures to maintain them. One of the most obvious examples of economic utility is the example of the deciduous tree planted on the south and west of a building (in the Northern Hemisphere), or north and east (in the Southern Hemisphere). The shade shelters and cools the building during the summer, but allows the sun to warm it in the winter after the leaves fall.

The USDA Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/programs/uesd/uep/products/cufr_195_REF90_57.PDF|author1=Craig W. Johnson |author2=Fred A. Baker |author3=Wayne S. Johnson |year=1990|title=Urban &amp; Community Forestry, a Guide for the Interior Western United States|publisher=USDA Forest Service, Intermountain Region, Ogden, Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes on page 17 that "Businesses flourish, people linger and shop longer, apartments and office space rent quicker, tenants stay longer, property values increase, new business and industry is attracted" by trees.  The physical effects of trees—the shade (solar regulation), humidity control, wind control, erosion control, evaporative cooling, sound and visual screening, traffic control, pollution absorption and precipitation—all have economic benefits.

===Air pollution reduction===
As cities struggle to comply with air quality standards, trees can help to clean the air. The most serious pollutants in the urban atmosphere are ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfuric oxides (SOx) and particulate pollution. Ground-level ozone, or smog, is created by chemical reactions between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. High temperatures increase the rate of this reaction. Vehicle emissions (especially diesel), and emissions from industrial facilities are the major sources of NOx.  Vehicle emissions, industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, trees and other plants are the major sources of VOCs. Particulate pollution, or [[particulates|particulate matter]] (PM10 and PM25), is made up of microscopic solids or liquid droplets that can be inhaled and retained in lung tissue causing serious health problems. Most particulate pollution begins as smoke or diesel soot and can cause serious health risk to people with heart and lung diseases and irritation to healthy citizens. Trees are an important, cost-effective solution to reducing pollution and improving air quality.

;Trees reduce temperatures and smog
With an extensive and healthy urban forest air quality can be drastically improved. Trees help to lower air temperatures and the urban heat island effect in urban areas (see: 'Trees are energy savers' for more information on this process). This reduction of temperature not only lowers energy use, it also improves air quality, as the formation of ozone is dependent on temperature. Trees reduce temperature not only by directly shading: when there is a large number of trees it create a difference in temperatures between the area when they are located and the neighbor area. This creates a difference in atmospheric pressure between the two areas, which creates wind. This phenomenon is called urban breeze cycle if the forest is near the city and park breeze cycle if the forest is in the city. That wind helps to lower temperature in the city.&lt;ref name="The role of trees in climate change managment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change Management|url=https://www.planning.org/cityparks/briefingpapers/climatechange.htm|website=American Planning Association|publisher=American Planning Association|access-date=21 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222051609/https://www.planning.org/cityparks/briefingpapers/climatechange.htm|archive-date=2017-12-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
*As temperatures climb, the formation of ozone increases.
*Healthy urban forests decrease temperatures, and reduce the formation of ozone.
*Large shade trees can reduce local ambient temperatures by 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;°C
*Maximum mid-day temperature reductions due to trees range from 0.04&amp;nbsp;°C to 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C per 1% canopy cover increase.
*In [[Sacramento County, California]], it was estimated that doubling the canopy cover to five million trees would reduce summer temperatures by 3 degrees{{Vague|degrees Fahrenheit? degrees Celsius?|date=February 2009}}. This reduction in temperature would reduce peak ozone levels by as much as 7% and smoggy days by 50%.

;Lower temperatures reduce emissions in parking lots&lt;ref&gt;Klaus I. Scott, James R. Simpson, and E. Gregory McPherson. [http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/programs/uesd/uep/products/11/psw_cufr68_EffectsTreeCoverOnEmissions.pdf "Effects of Tree Cover on Parking Lot Microclimate and Vehicle Emissions"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903230452/http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/programs/uesd/uep/products/11/psw_cufr68_EffectsTreeCoverOnEmissions.pdf |date=2013-09-03 }} USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station Western Center for Urban Forest Research and Education&lt;/ref&gt;
Temperature reduction from shade trees in parking lots lowers the amount of evaporative emissions from parked cars. Unshaded parking lots can be viewed as miniature heat islands, where temperatures can be even higher than surrounding areas. Tree canopies will reduce air temperatures significantly. Although the bulk of hydrocarbon emissions come from tailpipe exhaust, 16% of hydrocarbon emissions are from evaporative emissions that occur when the fuel delivery systems of parked vehicles are heated. These evaporative emissions and the exhaust emissions of the first few minutes of engine operation are sensitive to local microclimate. If cars are shaded in parking lots, evaporative emissions from fuel and volatilized plastics will be greatly reduced.  
*Cars parked in parking lots with 50% canopy cover emit 8% less through evaporative emissions than cars parked in parking lots with only 8% canopy cover.
*Due to the positive effects trees have on reducing temperatures and evaporative emissions in parking lots, cities like [[Davis, California]], have established parking lot ordinances that mandate 50% canopy cover over paved areas.
*"Cold Start" emissions
The volatile components of asphalt pavement evaporate more slowly in shaded parking lots and streets.  The shade not only reduces emissions, but reduces shrinking and cracking so that maintenance intervals can be lengthened.  Less maintenance means less hot asphalt (fumes) and less heavy equipment (exhaust).  The same principle applies to asphalt-based roofing.

;Active pollutant removal
Trees also reduce pollution by actively removing it from the atmosphere. Leaf [[stoma]]ta, the pores on the leaf surface, take in polluting gases which are then absorbed by water inside the leaf. Some species of trees are more susceptible to the uptake of pollution, which can negatively affect plant growth. Ideally, trees should be selected that take in higher quantities of polluting gases and are resistant to the negative effects they can cause.

A study across the [[Chicago]] region determined that trees removed approximately 17 tonnes of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), 93 tonnes of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO2), 98 tonnes of [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and 210 tonnes of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in 1991.

;Carbon sequestration
Urban forest managers are sometimes interested in the amount of carbon removed from the air and stored in their forest as wood in relation to the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere while running tree maintenance equipment powered by fossil fuels.

;Interception of particulate matter
In addition to the uptake of harmful gases, trees act as filters intercepting airborne particles and reducing the amount of harmful particulate matter. The particles are captured by the surface area of the tree and its foliage. These particles temporarily rest on the surface of the tree, as they can be washed off by rainwater, blown off by high winds, or fall to the ground with a dropped leaf. Although trees are only a temporary host to particulate matter, if they did not exist, the temporarily housed particulate matter would remain airborne and harmful to humans. Increased tree cover will increase the amount of particulate matter intercepted from the air.  
* Large evergreen trees with dense foliage collect the most particulate matter.
* The Chicago study determined that trees removed approximately 234 tonnes of particulate matter less than 10 micrometres (PM10) in 1991.
* Large healthy trees greater than 75&amp;nbsp;cm in trunk diameter remove approximately 70 times more air pollution annually (1.4&amp;nbsp;kg/yr) than small healthy trees less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter (0.02&amp;nbsp;kg/yr).

==Biogenic volatile organic compounds==
{{Refimprove section|date = July 2015}}

One important thing to consider when assessing the urban forest's effect on [[air quality]] is that trees emit some biogenic [[volatile organic compounds]] (BVOCs). These are the chemicals (primarily [[isoprene]] and [[monoterpene]]s) that make up the [[essential oil]]s, [[resin]]s, and other organic compounds that plants use to attract pollinators and repel predators. As mentioned above, VOCs react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) to form ozone. BVOCs account for less than 10% of the total amount of BVOCs emitted in urban areas. This means that BVOC emissions from trees can contribute to the formation of ozone. Although their contribution may be small compared with other sources, BVOC emissions could exacerbate a smog problem.

Not all species of trees, however, emit high quantities of BVOCs. The tree species with the highest isoprene emission rates should be planted with caution:  
*''[[Casuarina]]'' (Beefwood) [Casuarinaceae]
*''[[Eucalyptus]]'' [Myrtaceae]
*''[[Liquidambar]]'' (Sweetgum) [Altingiaceae]
*''[[Tupelo|Nyssa]]'' (Tupelo or Black gum) [Cornaceae]
*''[[Platanus]]'' (Plane) [Platanaceae]
*''[[Populus]]'' (Poplar) [Salicaceae]
*''[[Oak|Quercus]]'' (Oak) [Fagaceae]
*''[[Black locust|Robinia]]'' (Black locust) [Fabaceae]
*''[[Willow|Salix]]'' (Willow) [Salicaceae]

Trees that are well adapted to and thrive in certain environments should not be replaced just because they may be high BVOC emitters. The amount of emissions spent on maintaining a tree that may emit low amounts of BVOCs, but is not well suited to an area, could be considerable and outweigh any possible benefits of low BVOC emission rates.

Trees should not be labeled as polluters because their total benefits on air quality and emissions reduction far outweigh the possible consequences of BVOC emissions on ozone concentrations. Emission of BVOCs increase exponentially with temperature. Therefore, higher emissions will occur at higher temperatures. In [[desert climate]]s, locally native trees adapted to drought conditions emit significantly less BVOCs than plants native to wet regions. As discussed above, the formation of ozone is also temperature dependent. Thus, the best way to slow the production of ozone and emission of BVOCs is to reduce urban temperatures and the effect of the urban heat island. As suggested earlier, the most effective way to lower temperatures is with an increased canopy cover.

These effects of the urban forest on ozone production have only recently been discovered by the scientific community, so extensive and conclusive research has not yet been conducted.  There have been some studies quantifying the effect of BVOC emissions on the formation of ozone, but none have conclusively measured the effect of the urban forest. Important questions remain unanswered. For instance, it is unknown if there are enough chemical reactions between BVOC emissions and NOx to produce harmful amounts of ozone in urban environments. It is therefore, important for cities to be aware that this research is still continuing and conclusions should not be drawn before proper evidence has been collected. New research may resolve these issues.

'''Yttrium barium copper oxide''' ('''YBCO''') is a family of [[crystal]]line [[chemical compound]]s, famous for displaying [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. It includes the first material ever discovered to become [[superconductivity|superconducting]] above the boiling point of [[liquid nitrogen]] (77&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) at about 90&amp;nbsp;K. Many YBCO compounds have the general formula [[Yttrium|Y]][[Barium|Ba]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Copper|Cu]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (also known as Y123), although materials with other Y:Ba:Cu ratios exist, such as [[Yttrium|Y]][[Barium|Ba]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Copper|Cu]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (Y124) or [[Yttrium|Y]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Barium|Ba]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[Copper|Cu]]&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (Y247).

==History==
In April 1986, [[Georg Bednorz]] and [[Karl Alexander Müller|Karl Müller]], working at [[IBM]] in [[Zurich]], discovered that certain semiconducting oxides became superconducting at relatively high temperature, in particular, a [[lanthanum barium copper oxide]] becomes superconducting at 35&amp;nbsp;K. This oxide was an [[oxygen-deficient compound|oxygen-deficient]] [[perovskite]]-related material that proved promising and stimulated the search for related compounds with higher superconducting transition temperatures. In 1987, Bednorz and Müller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.

Following Bednorz and Müller's work, in 1987 [[Maw-Kuen Wu]] and [[Chu Ching-wu]] and their graduate students Ashburn and Torng at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]], discovered that YBCO has a [[critical temperature#superconductivity|critical temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) of 93 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Superconductivity at 93 K in a New Mixed-Phase Y-Ba-Cu-O Compound System at Ambient Pressure|journal = Physical Review Letters|year = 1987|volume = 58|pages = 908–910|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.908|pmid = 10035069|issue = 9|bibcode=1987PhRvL..58..908W|author1 = Wu|first1 = M.

To identify the phases, Chu turned to [[Ho-Kwang Mao|Dave Mao]] and [[Robert Hazen]] at the Geophysical Laboratory in the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. They found that the black one (which turned out to be the superconductor) had the composition YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−δ&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=C.

YBCO was the first material found to become superconducting above 77&amp;nbsp;K, the boiling point of [[liquid nitrogen]]. All materials developed before 1986 became superconducting only at temperatures near the boiling points of [[liquid helium]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 4.2&amp;nbsp;K) or [[liquid hydrogen]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 20.28&amp;nbsp;K) — the highest being [[Niobium-germanium|Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge]] at 23 K. The significance of the discovery of YBCO is the much lower cost of the refrigerant used to cool the material to below the [[critical temperature#Superconductivity|critical temperature]].

==Synthesis==
Relatively pure YBCO was first synthesized by heating a mixture of the metal carbonates at temperatures between 1000 and 1300 K.&lt;ref name=hous&gt;{{Housecroft2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=earnshaw&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:4 BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 CuCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + (1/2−''x'') O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + 13 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Modern syntheses of YBCO use the corresponding oxides and nitrates.&lt;ref name=earnshaw /&gt;

The superconducting properties of YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt; are sensitive to the value of ''x'', its oxygen content. Only those materials with 0&amp;nbsp;≤ ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤ 0.65 are superconducting below ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and when ''x''&amp;nbsp;~ 0.7, the material superconducts at the highest temperature of 95&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref name=earnshaw /&gt; or in highest magnetic fields: 120&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|T]] for '''B''' perpendicular and 250&amp;nbsp;T for '''B''' parallel to the CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.physb.2004.01.098|title = Upper critical field for optimally-doped  YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−δ&lt;/sub&gt; |journal = Physica B: Condensed Matter |volume = 346–347 |pages = 319 |year = 2004 |last1 = Sekitani |first1 = T. |last2 = Miura |first2 = N. |last3 = Ikeda |first3 = S. |last4 = Matsuda |first4 = Y.H. |last5 = Shiohara |first5 = Y. |bibcode = 2004PhyB..346..319S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being sensitive to the stoichiometry of oxygen, the properties of YBCO are influenced by the crystallization methods used. Care must be taken to [[sintering|sinter]] YBCO. YBCO is a crystalline material, and the best superconductive properties are obtained when crystal [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are aligned by careful control of [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] and [[quenching]] temperature rates.

Numerous other methods to synthesize YBCO have developed since its discovery by Wu and his co-workers, such as [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD),&lt;ref name="hous" /&gt;&lt;ref name=earnshaw /&gt; [[sol-gel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sun, Yang-Kook  |author2=Oh, In-Hwan  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.|year=1996|volume=35|page=4296|title=Preparation of Ultrafine YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−x&lt;/sub&gt; Superconductor Powders by the Poly(vinyl alcohol)-Assisted Sol−Gel Method|doi=10.1021/ie950527y|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aerosol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide Superconducting Powder Generation by An Aerosol Process|author = Zhou, Derong|publisher = University of Cincinnati|year = 1991|bibcode = 1991PhDT........28Z|page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; methods. These alternative methods, however, still require careful sintering to produce a quality product.

However, new possibilities have been opened since the discovery that trifluoroacetic acid ([[Trifluoroacetic acid|TFA]]), a source of fluorine, prevents the formation of the undesired [[barium carbonate]] (BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Routes such as CSD (chemical solution deposition) have opened a wide range of possibilities, particularly in the preparation of long YBCO tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = High quality YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;{7–''x''}&lt;/sub&gt; thin films grown by trifluoroacetates metal-organic deposition|year = 2003|journal =Supercond.

This, and the lack of dependence on vacuum, makes this method a very promising way to get scalable YBCO tapes.

==Structure==
[[Image:Ybco002.svg|thumb|320px|right|Part of the lattice structure of yttrium barium copper oxide]]
YBCO crystallizes in a defect [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite structure]] consisting of layers. The boundary of each layer is defined by planes of square planar CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units sharing 4 vertices. The planes can sometimes be slightly puckered.&lt;ref name="hous" /&gt; Perpendicular to these CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes are CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ribbons sharing 2 vertices. The [[yttrium]] atoms are found between the CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes, while the [[barium]] atoms are found between the CuO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ribbons and the CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes. This structural feature is illustrated in the figure to the right.

===More details===
[[File:Flyingsuperconductor.ogg|thumb|Like many [[type-II superconductor]]s, YBCO can exhibit [[flux pinning]]: lines of magnetic flux may be pinned in place in a crystal, with a force required to move a piece from a particular magnetic field configuration. A piece of YBCO placed above a magnetic track can thus levitate at a fixed height.&lt;ref name="hous" /&gt;]]
Although YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is a well-defined chemical compound with a specific structure and stoichiometry, materials with fewer than seven oxygen atoms per formula unit are [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s. The structure of these materials depends on the oxygen content. This non-stoichiometry is denoted by the x in the chemical formula YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. When ''x'' = 1, the O(1) sites in the Cu(1) layer are vacant and the structure is [[tetragonal]]. The tetragonal form of YBCO is insulating and does not superconduct. Increasing the oxygen content slightly causes more of the O(1) sites to become occupied. For ''x'' &lt; 0.65, Cu-O chains along the ''b'' axis of the crystal are formed. Elongation of the ''b'' axis changes the structure to [[orthorhombic]], with lattice parameters of ''a'' = 3.82, ''b'' = 3.89, and ''c'' = 11.68 Å.{{citation needed|reason=This data needs a reliable source, e.g. a fact sheet or a research paper.|date=February 2015}} Optimum superconducting properties occur when ''x'' ~ 0.07, i.e., almost all of the O(1) sites are occupied, with few vacancies.

In experiments where other elements are substituted on the Cu and Ba{{why||date=September 2014}} sites, evidence has shown that conduction occurs in the Cu(2)O planes while the Cu(1)O(1) chains act as charge reservoirs, which provide carriers to the CuO planes. However, this model fails to address superconductivity in the homologue Pr123 ([[praseodymium]] instead of yttrium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Physica C|volume=300|issue=3–4|year=1998|page=200|doi=10.1016/S0921-4534(98)00130-0|title=Crystal growth of superconductive PrBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−y&lt;/sub&gt;|last1=Oka|first1=K|bibcode = 1998PhyC..300..200O }}&lt;/ref&gt; This (conduction in the copper planes) confines conductivity to the ''a''-''b'' planes and a large anisotropy in transport properties is observed. Along the ''c'' axis, normal conductivity is 10 times smaller than in the ''a''-''b'' plane. For other [[Cuprate superconductor|cuprate]]s in the same general class, the anisotropy is even greater and inter-plane transport is highly restricted.

Furthermore, the superconducting length scales show similar anisotropy, in both penetration depth (λ&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 150&amp;nbsp;nm, λ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 800&amp;nbsp;nm) and coherence length, (ξ&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 2&amp;nbsp;nm, ξ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm). Although the coherence length in the ''a''-''b'' plane is 5 times greater than that along the ''c'' axis it is quite small compared to classic superconductors such as niobium (where ξ ≈ 40&amp;nbsp;nm). This modest coherence length means that the superconducting state is more susceptible to local disruptions from interfaces or defects on the order of a single unit cell, such as the boundary between twinned crystal domains. This sensitivity to small defects complicates fabricating devices with YBCO, and the material is also sensitive to degradation from humidity.

==Proposed applications==
[[File:YBCO superconductor.JPG|thumb|left|YBCO superconductor in [[Tallinn University of Technology|TTÜ]].]]
Many possible applications of this and related high temperature superconducting materials have been discussed. For example, superconducting materials are finding use as [[superconducting magnets|magnets]] in [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[magnetic levitation]], and [[Josephson junction]]s. (The most used material for power cables and magnets is [[BSCCO]].)

YBCO has yet to be used in many applications involving superconductors for two primary reasons:
*First, although single crystals of YBCO have a very high critical current density, [[polycrystal]]s have a very low critical [[current density]]: only a small current can be passed while maintaining superconductivity. This problem is due to crystal [[grain boundaries]] in the material. When the grain boundary angle is greater than about 5°, the supercurrent cannot cross the boundary. The grain boundary problem can be controlled to some extent by preparing thin films via CVD or by texturing the material to align the grain boundaries.
*A second problem limiting the use of this material in technological applications is associated with processing of the material. Oxide materials such as this are brittle, and forming them into [[superconducting wire]]s by any conventional process does not produce a useful superconductor. (Unlike [[BSCCO]], the [[powder-in-tube]] process does not give good results with YBCO.)

Cooling materials to [[liquid nitrogen]] temperature (77 K) is often not practical on a large scale, although many commercial magnets are routinely cooled to liquid helium temperatures (4.2 K).

The most promising method developed to utilize this material involves deposition of YBCO on flexible metal tapes coated with buffering metal oxides. This is known as '''coated conductor'''. Texture (crystal plane alignment) can be introduced into the metal tape itself (the RABiTS process) or a textured ceramic buffer layer can be deposited, with the aid of an ion beam, on an untextured alloy substrate (the [[IBAD]] process). Subsequent oxide layers prevent diffusion of the metal from the tape into the superconductor while transferring the template for texturing the superconducting layer. Novel variants on CVD, PVD, and solution deposition techniques are used to produce long lengths of the final YBCO layer at high rates. Companies pursuing these processes include [[American Superconductor]], Superpower (a division of [[Furukawa Electric]]), [[Sumitomo]], [[Fujikura]], [[Nexans]] Superconductors, [[Commonwealth Fusion Systems]], and European Advanced Superconductors. A much larger number of research institutes have also produced YBCO tape by these methods.

The superconducting tape may be the key to a [[tokamak]] fusion reactor design that can achieve [[Fusion energy gain factor|breakeven]] energy production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/small-modular-efficient-fusion-plant-0810 A small, modular, efficient fusion plant | MIT News]. Newsoffice.mit.edu. Retrieved on 2015-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  YBCO is often categorized as a [[rare-earth barium copper oxide]] (REBCO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/article/3028113/sustainable-it/mit-takes-a-page-from-tony-stark-edges-closer-to-an-arc-fusion-reactor.html MIT takes a page from Tony Stark, edges closer to an ARC fusion reactor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface modification==
Surface modification of materials has often led to new and improved properties. Corrosion inhibition, polymer adhesion and nucleation, preparation of organic superconductor/insulator/high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductor trilayer structures, and the fabrication of metal/insulator/superconductor tunnel junctions have been developed using surface-modified YBCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Langmuir|year=1998|volume=14|issue=22|title=Surface Coordination Chemistry of YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−δ&lt;/sub&gt; |author=Xu, F. |page=6505|doi=10.1021/la980143n|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These molecular layered materials are synthesized using [[cyclic voltammetry]]. Thus far, YBCO layered with alkylamines, arylamines, and [[thiol]]s have been produced with varying stability of the molecular layer. It has been proposed that amines act as [[Lewis bases]] and bind to [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acidic]] Cu surface sites in YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; to form stable [[coordination bond]]s.

==Hobbyist use==
Shortly after it was discovered, the U.K. Journal ''[[New Scientist]]'' published the 'recipe' for synthesizing YBCO by Heidi Grant (Daughter of author Paul Grant, and herself a high school student at the time of publication) with tools and equipment available in a high-school science laboratory of the time &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=Qe_hJ8qZb7oC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=New+Scientist+Superconductor+Recipe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dRB_IVOkvX&amp;sig=uHzg2UfOjA19E1aBuMVfypIEp3g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2ybK-mYfcAhVEnZQKHVZpAIwQ6AEIUzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Scientist%20Superconductor%20Recipe&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; in their edition of 30th July 1987.

Thanks to this and other publications at the time, YBCO is a popular high-temperature superconductor for use by hobbyists and in education, as the magnetic levitation effect can be easily demonstrated utilising liquid nitrogen as coolant.
