'''''Advertising Age''''', or '''''Ad Age''''', is a global media brand publishing analysis, news and data on [[marketing]] and media. The magazine was started as a [[broadsheet]] newspaper in [[Chicago]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/media/ad-age-timeline-classic-covers/310553/|title=Ad Age Comes of Age: A Timeline of Classic Covers|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, its content appears in multiple formats, including AdAge.com, daily e-mail newsletters, social channels, events and a bimonthly print magazine.

Ad Age is based in New York City. Its parent company, [[Detroit]]-based [[Crain Communications]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vault.com/company-profiles/media-entertainment/crain-communications-inc/company-overview.aspx|title=Crain Communications, Inc.{{!}}Company Profile{{!}}Vault.com|newspaper=Vault|access-date=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a privately held publishing company with more than 30 magazines, including ''[[Autoweek]]'', ''Crain's New York Business'', ''[[Crain's Chicago Business]]'', ''Crain's Detroit Business'', and ''[[Automotive News]]''.

== History ==
Ad Age launched as a broadsheet newspaper in Chicago in 1930.

In 1999, ''Advertising Age'' published a list of the top 100 players in [[Advertising#History|advertising history]]. Among these were [[Alvin Achenbaum]], [[Bill Backer]], Marion Harper Jr., [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], [[ACNielsen]], [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]], and [[J. Walter Thompson]]. In 1980, Henderson Advertising, founded by [[James M. Henderson]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[South Carolina]], became the first agency outside New York or Chicago to be named "Advertising Agency of the Year" by Ad Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowitall.org/legacy/laureates/james%20m.%20henderson%20.html|title=James M. Henderson (1921-1995)|work=knowitall.org|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site AdCritic.com was acquired by The Ad Age Group in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/au/news/trade-mag-publisher-absorbs-adcritic|title=Trade-mag publisher absorbs AdCritic|work=CNET|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An industry trade magazine, ''BtoB'', was folded into Ad Age in January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.talkingnewmedia.com/2013/10/01/btob-magazine-to-fold-into-advertising-age-in-2014/|title=Crain Communications says it will fold BtoB magazine into Advertising Age in 2014|author=D.B. Hebbard|date=October 1, 2013|work=Talking New Media|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ad Age underwent its first major rebrand in 87 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/90144424/after-87-years-ad-age-rebrands-for-a-new-era|title=After 87 Years, Ad Age Rebrands For A New Era|date=2017-09-29|work=Co.Design|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design work was done by the agency [http://originalchampionsofdesign.com/ Original Champions of Design].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8007">An '''aggregate project plan''' (APP) is the process of creating development goals and objectives and using these goals and objectives to improve productivity as well as development capabilities.  The purpose of this process is generally to ensure that each project will accomplish its development goals and objectives. Projects can be differentiated into five types of projects: breakthrough, platform, derivative, [[R&amp;D]], or partnered projects (such as projects performed with partners or [[allianced firms]]). This differentiation determines a project's development goals and objectives as well as resources allocated to that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An aggregate project plan provides [[management]] with a categorized list of projects, which balances short- and long-term goals. This list assists management in making difficult decisions such as when to start projects and which projects should be cannibalized. Starting projects in a sequential manner according to the firm's strategy as well as resources available will allow fewer projects to continue simultaneously and improve productivity.
Another benefit is the creation of an organizational form for each project type. This creates a focus on the generation of competence and builds the speed and productivity of individuals as well as the organization itself.&lt;ref&gt;

== Aggregate project planning process ==
This is the process a firm undergoes to create an aggregate project plan: &lt;br /&gt;
:1.	Create a well-defined and easily understood strategy.
:2.	Relay the strategy with the aim of developing new products, processes, or services and improving efficiency of current projects.
:3.	Establish clear definitions of each type of project: breakthrough, platform, derivative, R&amp;D, or partnered projects.
:4.	List current projects and classify each by project type.
:5.	Eliminate projects that don’t fit within a project type.
:6.	Estimate the average time and resources needed for each project type based on past experience.
:7.	Determine the desired mix of projects.
:8.	Identify existing resources and estimate the number of projects those resources can support.
:9.	Decide which projects to pursue and eliminate the rest.
:10.	Allocate resources to remaining projects and work to improve development capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;

==Five categories of development projects==

=== Derivative projects ===
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Derivative projects can vary from additions or augmentations to existing products or simple price reductions over time. &lt;i&gt; Improvement work on derivative projects falls into three categories, incremental product changes, incremental process changes, and incremental changes in both sectors.&lt;/i&gt;  Due to these minor changes, derivative projects require trivial effort &amp; resources on both development and management.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
''Examples: special edition [[Paint sealant|car paint]] and [[iPod]] [[hard drive]] size updates''&lt;br/&gt;
Many organizations make derivative products, which can range from special editions of existing cars, adding nothing more than a special paint scheme and interior or a new iPod with a large hard drive.

===Platform projects===
&lt;br/&gt;
These projects are the next generation of products for the company.  These are major changes from existing products/services or the way the product/service is made or delivered. These create a new ‘platform‘ for growth in the future.  These projects offer significant improvements in cost, quality, and performance.  Platforms are created to meet the needs of a [[Core (group)|core group]] of customers changing more than one aspect of a product or service; while derivatives normally only change one aspect of a product or service.&lt;br/&gt;
''Examples: new [[car model]]s. [[Microprocessor]]''&lt;br/&gt; 
New car models have major changes in a number of areas which include manufacturing and product changes when they are released creating a platform for the car company.  A new microprocessor with changes in speed, size, and capabilities, while having a new process to create them, adds a new platform for the company.

===Breakthrough Projects===
&lt;br/&gt;
These projects are the highest risk and the highest reward category.  These involve the newest technology greater than that of a platform project.  This use of this technology may be ‘disruptive’ to the rest of the [[industry]] and create an entirely new product category to define the industry.  This may be a brand new technology or significant changes to existing projects.  These types of projects often incorporate new and innovative manufacturing or servicing processes. These types of projects should be given leeway to work outside of normal and existing operating techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
''Examples: [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] data transfer, [[hybrid car]]s''&lt;br/&gt;
Fiber optic data transfer cables revolutionized the industry of data transfer. This new technology was a breakthrough in the industry with lines of [[dark fiber]] laid though many major cities. Hybrid cars are the first types of cars not to rely solely on the use of fossil fuels.

===Research &amp; Development===
&lt;br/&gt;
The invention of knowledge of new materials and technologies that will be used in commercial development.  R&amp;D projects are high risk endeavors with a possibility of high returns.  Research &amp; development is important since it will always occur before product and process development.  R&amp;D projects also use the same resources as commercial development and will always compete for them.  Every organization has different expectations for R&amp;D projects due to its high possibility of failure.  &lt;br/&gt;
''Example: [[3D Television]]''&lt;br/&gt;
An example of a R&amp;D project would be a Television company attempting to develop a new, 3D viewing system for consumers.  This would require extensive research &amp; development that would have a high up-front cost and possible return with a large risk of failure.

===Partnered projects===
&lt;br/&gt;
These projects can fall under any of the other four categories. However, these projects can often be overlooked while mapping the aggregate project plan.  These plans are important and their resource usage should be included in planning.&lt;br/&gt;
''Example: [[Pepsi]] and [[Starbucks]]''&lt;br/&gt;
Starbucks has an agreement that Pepsi will bottle their beverages they sell in retail sources. This is a partnership between both companies that neither can ignore and the resources should be accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Contract law}}
'''Anticipatory repudiation''', also called an '''anticipatory breach''', is a term in the [[law]] of [[contract]]s that describes a declaration by the promising party to a contract that he or she does not intend to live up to his or her obligations under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Which might entitle the other party to claim damages. International principle: [http://www.trans-lex.org/945500 Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repudiation and retraction== 
A party is considered to have repudiated a contract when they evidence a lack of willingness or an inability to perform their contractual obligations. A repudiation of a contract by one party (the repudiating party) will entitle the other party (the aggrieved party) to elect to terminate the contract. This is based on objective intentions i.e. the repudiating party's words or conduct.;&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Cargo Carriers Corp v Citati'' [1957] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 401; See also {{cite AustLII|HCA|31|1953|litigants=Carr v JA Berriman Pty Ltd |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1953/31.pdf (1953) 89 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 327] |courtname=auto |date=}}; {{cite AustLII|HCA|23|1989|litigants=Laurinda Pty Ltd v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1989) 166 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 623 at p647 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This unwillingness or inability to perform a condition must deprive the aggrieved party of substantially the whole of the benefit that they would have received if the remaining obligations were performed under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1985|litigants=Progressive Mailing House v Tabali |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 17 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When such an event occurs, the performing party to the contract is excused from having to fulfill his or her obligations. However, the repudiation can be retracted by the promising party so long as there has been no material change in the position of the performing party in the interim. A retraction of the repudiation restores the performer's obligation to perform on the contract.

Another rationale for the doctrine of repudiation is based on the breach of an implied term not rendering future performance futile: "[O]ne essential promise which is implied in every contract is that neither party will without just cause repudiate his obligations under the contract, whether the time for performance has arrived or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|632|1938|litigants=Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Repudiation of the contract by one party entitles the other party the right to terminate and claim for damages. However, it is possible that the repudiating party does not repudiate the entire contract but only certain obligations. In this case, the aggrieved party will only acquire the right to terminate if the repudiating party repudiates an obligation which, if breached, would grant a right to terminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|51|1989|litigants=Foran v Wight |parallecite=(1989) 168 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 385 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the promising party's repudiation makes it impossible to fulfil its promise, then retraction is not possible and no act by the promising party can restore the performing party's obligations under the contract. For example, if A promises to give B a unique sculpture in exchange for B painting A's house, but A then sells the sculpture to C before B begins the job, this act by A constitutes an anticipatory repudiation which excuses B from performing. Once the sculpture has left A's possession, there is no way that A can fulfil the promise to give the sculpture to B.

The question arises as to why any party would want to provide notice of anticipatory breach.  The reason is that once the performing party is informed of the anticipatory breach, a duty is then created for the performing party to mitigate damages as a result of the breach. Another situation where anticipatory repudiation can occur is where a party has reason to believe the other party is not going to perform and requests reasonable assurances that the other party will perform (see UCC 2-609(1)).  If such reasonable assurances are not given, it will constitute anticipatory repudiation, for which the performing party has various remedies, including termination. However, anticipatory repudiation only applies to a bilateral [[executory contract]] with non-performed duties on both sides.  Additionally, the repudiation must be unequivocal.

== Measuring damages ==
{{original research|section|date=January 2017}}
According to UCC 2-713(1) damages are to be measured at the time when the buyer learned of the breach. This is easy with a one transaction sale, e.g. a widget at the purchaser's door step on X date,; but when does the purchaser learn of the breach in an anticipatory repudiation? There are three main views:

# When the buyer learns of the repudiation
# When the buyer learns of repudiation plus a commercially reasonable time
##UCC 2-610(a) gives this indication, the purchaser would be waiting at your risk if the vendor determined the market price at the time you learn of repudiation.
##UCC 2-723(1) would indicate this, but it would be superfluous with 2-713 so 2-713 must have something other than the plain meaning.
##(1) If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to 2-723 trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market price (Section  UCC 2-708 or Section UCC 2-713) shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.
##This is the majority view: when repudiation is accepted or within a commercial reasonable time
#Time of performance, when the trail that occurs after the time of performance
##This is different than the plain reading for UCC 2-713.

In November 2016, the company launched Any.do 4, that combined the a to do list, a calendar, and a part AI part human personal assistant that can complete users tasks in a single app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-evolution-productivity-omer-perchik?published=t|title=The Next Evolution of Productivity|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the company announced a partnership with Amazon Alexa and Slack. In 2018, the company launched a smart grocery list and shopping list feature as well as integration with Google Assistant and Siri.

Any.do was co-founded by Omer Perchik, Itay Kahana, and Yoni Lindenfeld. It has offices in both [[Tel Aviv]] and [[San Francisco]].

== History ==
Prior to Any.do, co-founders ''Omer Perchik'', ''Itay Kahana'' and ''Yoni Lindenfeld'' launched a simpler version of the app on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] called Taskos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Tessa|title=I'm Omer Perchik, and This Is the Story Behind Any.do|url=http://lifehacker.com/im-omer-perchik-and-this-is-the-story-behind-any-do-1440128266|publisher=Lifehacker|date=Oct 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010, Taskos had 1.3 million users and served as a test version for what would eventually become Any.do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Grove|first=Jennifer|title=Collaborative to-do app Any.do puts Reminders to shame|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/11/10/any-do/|publisher=Venturebeat|date=Nov 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company opened development offices in Tel Aviv, Israel and opened its business headquarters in San Francisco, California in 2012.&lt;ref name="Gannes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20120604/well-liked-android-task-list-any-do-comes-to-iphone-and-chrome/|title=Well-Liked Android Task List Any.DO Comes to iPhone and Chrome|last=Gannes|first=Liz|date=June 4, 2012|publisher=All Things D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, the company released a study revealing the mobile habits of their most productive “super users”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229897|title=5 Habits of Productivity App Super Users|last=|first=|date=Nov 18, 2013|website=|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=Dec 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cal app (deprecated) ===

Any.do released their second app, Cal for iPhone, in July 2013.&lt;ref name="Tofel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/07/11/book-an-appointment-to-the-app-store-any-dos-cal-just-launched-for-ios/|title=Book an appointment to the App Store: Any.Do’s Cal just launched for iOS|last=Tofel|first=Kevin C.|date=July 11, 2013|publisher=GigaOm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cal for Android was later released in December 2013.&lt;ref name="Yeung"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/12/04/dos-cal-smart-calendar-app-lands-android/|title=Any.do’s Cal smart calendar app lands on Android|last=Yeung|first=Ken|date=Dec 4, 2013|publisher=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Any.do, Cal is an interactive, gesture-based calendar app with social integrations. Unlike other calendar apps, Cal helps users focus on the immediate schedule of their day and find pockets of free time for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiegerman|first=Seth|title=Any.DO's Calendar App Helps You Find More Free Time|url=http://mashable.com/2013/07/11/any-do-calendar/|publisher=Mashable|date=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

On October 9, 2013, The Verge reported Any.do to be the one of the main inspirations behind Jony Ive’s [[iOS 7]] redesign, and others have noted its similarities to the revamped Apple operating system.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4817146/taskmasters-how-israeli-intelligence-officers-helped-inspire-the-look-of-ios-7|title=Taskmasters: how Israeli intelligence officers helped inspire the look of iOS 7|last=Newton|first=Casey|date=Oct 9, 2013|publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiegerman|first=Seth|title=iOS 7 Updates Look a Little Too Familiar to Some Apple Developers|url=http://mashable.com/2013/06/11/ios-7-developers/|publisher=Mashable|date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

Any.do announced $1 million in angel funding in November 2011.&lt;ref name="Perez1M" /&gt;

By May 2013 the company had raised $3.5 million from [[Genesis Partners]], [[Eric Schmidt]]’s Innovation Endeavors, [[Blumberg Capital]], Joe Lonsdale of [[Palantir Technologies]], Brian Koo of [[Formation 8]], Joe Greenstein of [[Flixter]], and Felicis Ventures.&lt;ref name="Perez3M"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/13/intelligent-to-do-list-app-any-do-raises-3-5-million-will-further-expand-into-personal-productivity-space/|title=Intelligent To Do List App Any.DO Raises $3.5 Million, Will Further Expand Into Personal Productivity Space|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=May 13, 2013|publisher=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company raised additional unannounced funding from a group of strategic investors including [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] of AME Cloud Ventures and [[Steve Chen]] of YouTube, among others, by October of that same year.&lt;ref name="Newton" /&gt;

'''Blanchette Ferry Hooker''' (October 2, 1909 – November 29, 1992) was the wife of [[John D. Rockefeller III]] and mother of [[Jay Rockefeller]]. She was twice president of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Blanchette"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teltsch|first1=Kathleen|title=Blanchette Rockefeller, 83, Philanthropist, Dies|work=The New York Times|date=December 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Blanchette Ferry Hooker was born in [[Manhattan, New York]] on October 2, 1909. She was the daughter of [[Elon Huntington Hooker]], founder of [[Hooker Chemical Company]], and his wife, Blanche Ferry.

She graduated from [[Miss Chapin's School]] in 1927, where she was president of the student government. She graduated from  [[Vassar College]] in 1931 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in music. On November 11, 1932, she married John D. Rockefeller III, a [[Lineal descendant|scion]] of the prominent [[Rockefeller family]], at [[Riverside Church]] in New York City. They had four children: 
*[[Jay Rockefeller|John Davison "Jay" Rockefeller IV]] 
*[[Hope Aldrich Rockefeller]]
*Sandra Ferry Rockefeller
*[[Alida Rockefeller Messinger|Alida Ferry Rockefeller]]

Blanchette devoted her time to community service, education, and the arts -  in particular the collection of Asian and American art.  "She had been active in the affairs of the Museum of Modern Art since 1949 and was elected a member of the Board of Trustees in December 1952.  In 1958, at a time when many Americans derided modern art or thought it communist and subversive, Rockefeller lent her support to the International Program that helped send ''The New American Painting'', the first major exhibition of [[Abstract Expressionism]], to eight European cities." &lt;ref&gt;Taken in whole or part from http://www.rockarch.org/publications/resrep/rr1997.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller Guest House, NYC, NY.jpg|thumb|Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller Guest House, New York City]]
In 1948, Blanchette Rockefeller commissioned a guest house by architect [[Philip Johnson]]. Located at 242 East [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]] next to the Turtle Bay Music School, it was one of the first residential buildings in New York City to reflect the influence of the Modern movement. The 1950 guest house was a place in which she could display her modern art collection and entertain friends. The Rockefellers donated the house (historically landmarked in 2000) to the Museum of Modern Art in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/00-ROCKEFELLER-GUESTHOUSE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

"Blanchette Rockefeller provided enlightened leadership to MoMA as president of the museum from 1972 through 1985. Two of her most important gifts were [[Willem de Kooning]]’s ''Woman II'' (1952) and [[Clyfford Still]]’s ''Painting'' (1951), an Abstract-Expressionist landscape. The Abstract Expressionist galleries on the second floor are named in her honor. In 1979 Rockefeller accepted an Oscar on behalf of MoMA’s work in film."&lt;ref&gt;Taken in whole or part from {{cite web |url=http://archive.rockefeller.edu/publications/resrep/rr1997.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823035306/http://archive.rockefeller.edu/publications/resrep/rr1997.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rockefellers maintained homes in New York City and at "Fieldwood Farm" in the expansive Rockefeller family estate of Pocantico (see [[Kykuit]] in [[Westchester County, New York]].

She died in her home near [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]] of [[pneumonia]], a complication of [[Alzheimer's Disease]], on November 29, 1992, at the age of 83.&lt;ref name="Blanchette"/&gt; Blanchette was buried at the Rockefeller Family Cemetery, [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]]. The Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute (BRNI) at [[West Virginia University]] in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]] is named in her honor.

[[File:Princess Murat.jpg|thumb|Close-up of portrait at the DAR Museum in Washington, DC.]]
'''Catherine Daingerfield Willis Gray Murat''' (August 17, 1803 &amp;ndash; August 6, 1867) was an American socialite.  She was married to Prince Achille Murat, an exiled Napoleonic prince living in America, from 1826 to 1847.  She was born near [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] and died in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], United States.

==Family==
Murat was the great-grandniece of [[George Washington]]. She was a daughter of [[Colonel]] Byrd C. Willis (August 29, 1781 – 1846) and his wife Mary Lewis.  Mary Lewis was the granddaughter of [[Fielding Lewis]], George Washington's brother-in-law.  Through the Lewis family, she was also a relative of explorer [[Meriwether Lewis]].

Her parents made their first home in [[Orange, Virginia|Orange]] near the Court House. Later they came to [[Willis Hill]]. Col. Willis paid little attention to the management of the plantation and instead spent his time fox hunting, racing, and attending parties. Income was derived from the race profits and the sale of fire wood.

Catherine married Atchison Gray, son of John Gray of [[Traveller's Rest (Kearneysville, West Virginia)]]. Atchison died less than 12 months after their marriage and their child, born after his death, died also.

==Willis family in Florida==

About 1825, Catherine Murat came to Tallahassee with her parents, three brothers and two sisters. In 1826 she met and married her second husband, [[Prince Achille Murat]]. He was a son of [[Joachim Murat]], former [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|King of Naples]] and [[Caroline Bonaparte]].

[[Image:TlhMusBellevue.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Bellevue in 2007, now an exhibit at the [[Tallahassee Museum]].]]

His maternal uncles included [[Joseph Bonaparte]], [[Napoleon I of France]], [[Lucien Bonaparte]], [[Louis Bonaparte]] and [[Jérôme Bonaparte]]. His maternal aunts included [[Elisa Bonaparte]] and [[Pauline Bonaparte]].

Catherine (Willis Gray) Murat, was entertained when abroad. On 8 September 1831&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/443338/medal-commemorating-the-coronation-of-william-iv |title=Medal commemorating the Coronation of William IV 1831|website=Royal Collection Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Catherine was present at the coronation of [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] and was given a seat in [[Westminster Abbey]]. &lt;ref name=HistoryWired&gt;{{cite web| url=http://historywired.si.edu/detail.cfm?ID=225| title=John Bull Locomotive| work=History Wired| publisher=Smithsonian Institution| accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PRRchron1831&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR1831%20June%2004.wd.pdf| title=PRR Chronology: 1831| publisher=Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society| date=June 2004| accessdate=2008-08-04| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, she inherited the {{convert|2000|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Lipona Plantation]] in [[Jefferson County, Florida]] upon the death of her husband. In 1854 she bought [[Bellevue (Florida)|Bellevue]], in [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]], which became her primary residence. 

Catherine became involved in the nation’s first successful preservation effort, the work to preserve George Washington’s home. In 1858, Murat was appointed the first Vice Regent for Florida for the [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]], the title given the central person in each state organizing the association’s work. Working closely with [[Ellen Call Long]], she led the efforts as the state raised $3,791 toward the restoration of [[Mount Vernon]], the largest per capita amount raised by any of the 30 contributing states. Murat served in that post until her death. Despite her staunch Unionism, she was named master of ceremonies during the celebrations of the Florida Secession Convention in 1861. Later, during the [[American Civil War]], Murat participated in the local "Soldiers Aid Societies," who met as sewing circles to clothe the southern troops.

Early in 1866, [[Napoleon III of France]], a maternal first cousin of her husband, granted Murat an annuity from the French government in consideration of her losses during the Civil War. Catherine Murat died August 6, 1867 at Bellevue.

Catherine's marker in the old [[Tallahassee]] Episcopal Cemetery reads: "SACRED to the Memory of PRINCESS C. A. MURAT, Widow of COL. CHARLES LOUIS NAPOLEON ACHILLES MURAT, and Daughter of the late COL. BIRD C. WILLIS, of Virginia. Who departed this life on 6 August 1867, in the 64th year of her age. A kind and affectionate wife and sister, a sincere and devoted friend. None knew her but to love her. None named her but to praise. This Monument is erected to her memory, by her bereaved Brother and Sister."

Such actions can include data gathering and analysis, organizational [[restructuring]], improving [[human resource management]] and [[training]], enhancing [[wages|pay]] and [[Employee benefit|benefits]] while assuring [[sustainability]] under overall [[finance|fiscal]] constraints, and strengthening measures for [[performance management]], [[public participation]], [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]],  and combating [[Political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/civil-service-reform/|title=Civil service reform - GSDRC|work=GSDRC|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil service reform agenda in [[Developing country|developing countries]] has evolved and changed its focus over the decades. The [[academic literature]] on civil service reform has provided arguments and counterarguments clarifying how several approaches to reform affect the overall performance of the civil service.  The increasing availability of empirical [[data]] allows to test the [[effectiveness]] of specific reforms in a given context. While designing effective civil service reforms is a tremendously complex task considering that the right mix of corruption control and performance improvements may vary greatly across and within countries, [[Empirical research|empirical]] as well as [[qualitative research]] can contribute to the body of evidence-based knowledge on civil service reforms in developing countries.

Many challenges remain as persisting [[political economy]] factors hinder the success of civil service reforms.&lt;ref name=":142"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simone|first=Bunse|last2=Verena|first2=Fritz|date=2012-08-01|title=Making public sector reforms work : political and economic contexts, incentives, and strategies|pages=1–54|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/649411468328580569/Making-public-sector-reforms-work-political-and-economic-contexts-incentives-and-strategies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches to Civil Service Reform ==

=== The Influence of Weberian Bureaucracy ===
[[Max Weber]]'s model of the ideal type of [[public administration]] has been an influential approach to civil service reforms in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/capacity-building/global-centre-for-public-service-excellence/PS-Reform.html|title=From Old Public Administration to the New Public Service|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bureaucratic]] type of administration contrasts with the [[Inheritance|patrimonial]] type in its underlying organizing principles. Weber’s organization of the public administration relies on a clearly defined hierarchical structure with a system of subordination and supervision, a division of labor and specified positions with assigned responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Udy|first=Stanley H.|date=1959|title="Bureaucracy" and "Rationality" in Weber's Organization Theory: An Empirical Study|jstor=2088566|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=24|issue=6|pages=791–795|doi=10.2307/2088566}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to the patrimonial system in which there is no distinction between private and public domains, the [[Weberian bureaucracy]] is defined by its impersonal and impartial character. Civil servants operate according to a set of rules and procedures they must observe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlström|first=Carl|last2=Lapuente|first2=Victor|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2009|title=Bureaucracy, Politics and Corruption|ssrn=1450742|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impartiality is in part attained through the professionalization of the civil service and [[meritocratic]] recruitment through competitive examinations.  For full-time and professionalized civil servants, public office-holding becomes a 'vocation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Weberian [[ideal-typical]] principles have served as foundations for civil service reforms in developing countries. Scholars and policymakers have been interested in identifying the specific features that determine bureaucratic efficiency and corruption and the mechanisms through which these features increase effectiveness and restrict corrupt behaviour in the civil service.

Empirical studies&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-01-01|title=Bureaucratic structure and bureaucratic performance in less developed countries|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272799000444|journal=Journal of Public Economics|language=en|volume=75|issue=1|pages=49–71|doi=10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00044-4|issn=0047-2727|last1=Rauch|first1=James E.|last2=Evans|first2=Peter B.|citeseerx=10.1.1.203.288}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that meritocratic recruitment of public officials in particular is associated with lower corruption levels.  There are several ways in which meritocratic recruitment and promotion can restrict corrupt behaviour. To begin with, administering entry examinations and educational attainment requirements enable the selection of competent civil servants. As a matter of fact, a study by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2013/03/arezki.htm|title=Degrees of Development- Finance &amp; Development, March 2013|website=www.imf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that better-educated civil servants are related to lower levels of corruption, better performance including better public finance management and higher [[tax revenue]] mobilization as well as higher [[economic growth]].

Furthermore, the internal promotion and career stability of merit-recruited civil servants create a sense of shared commitment to the 'vocation' of office-holding that establishes '[[Esprit de corps|esprit de corps']], making it harder for corruption to occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other evidence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; suggests that a professional merit-based civil service preempts corruption not necessarily through the selection of capable officials but rather through the appointment of civil servants whose interests differ from politicians'. Misaligned interests create a coordination problem which prevents corrupt practices and instead introduces a system of mutual monitoring.

=== Employment and Pay Reforms ===
During the 1980s, developing countries subject to [[structural adjustment]] programs (SAPs) experienced fiscal austerity notably manifested through pressures to reduce the public wage bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbara|first=Nunberg|date=1989-12-31|title=Public sector pay and employment reform : a review of World Bank experience|pages=1|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/424331468739769767/Public-sector-pay-and-employment-reform-a-review-of-World-Bank-experience|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Klitgaard|R. Klitgaard]] raised concerns that falling civil service wages could exacerbate bureaucratic inefficiencies and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1989-04-01|title=Incentive myopia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X89902544|journal=World Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=447–459|doi=10.1016/0305-750X(89)90254-4|issn=0305-750X|last1=Klitgaard|first1=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low public sector wages have been associated with lower performance and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1990-07-01|title=Internal adjustments to falling civil service salaries: Insights from Uganda|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X90900829|journal=World Development|language=en|volume=18|issue=7|pages=1003–1014|doi=10.1016/0305-750X(90)90082-9|issn=0305-750X|last1=Chew|first1=David C.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salaries below [[opportunity cost]] can induce civil servants to opt for potentially harmful adaptive strategies and seek opportunities for own-account activities. Public officials may ask for compensation through informal or illegal means and these coping strategies compromise the efficiency and honesty of civil service organizations.

Given these arguments, increasing public officials' wages and other employment benefits has been an important aspect of the civil service reform agenda in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/civilservice/mayseminar/Mukherjee.pdf|title=Civil Service Pay and Reward|last=Mukherjee|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic models based on the early work of [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|last2=Stigler|first2=George J.|date=1974-01-01|title=Law Enforcement, Malfeasance, and Compensation of Enforcers|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1086/467507|issn=0047-2530}}&lt;/ref&gt; have had a particular influence on the policy debate.

[[Principal–agent problem|Principal-agent]] models of corruption in the civil service provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between public service pay and corruption.  The shirking model ([[Shapiro–Stiglitz theory|Shapiro-Stiglitz]]) is centred on the choice public officials who have the opportunity to be corrupt must make. These [[Rationality|rational]] [[Utility maximization problem|utility-maximizing]] agents decide to engage in [[Moral hazard|morally hazardous]] behaviour based on a [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost-benefit analysis]] equating the expected returns to corruption ([[Bribery|bribes]]) to the costs of being corrupt (penalties, potential foregone future earnings).&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/do-higher-salaries-lower-petty-corruption-a-policy-experiment-on-west-africa-s-highways|title=Do higher salaries lower petty corruption? A policy experiment on West Africa's highways - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption is detected with a certain probability and is punished by job loss or other penalties. The model predicts that, [[Ceteris paribus|all else equal]], higher wages can deter corruption by increasing the value of behaving honestly. However, when bribes are high and punishment and the probability of detection are low, substantial increases in public official's wages may be required to preempt bribery. Another model explaining bureaucratic corruption, the fair-wage model, makes a distinction between need-based and greed-based corruption. According to this theory, public officials are not necessarily driven by greed but find corruption tempting when their salaries do not allow to meet subsistence levels. 'Fairness' is also determined by other factors, such as the salaries of peers within the civil service, private sector wages, social expectations and the status of civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gong|first=Ting|last2=Wu|first2=Alfred M.|date=2012-10-08|title=Does Increased Civil Service Pay Deter Corruption?: Evidence from China|ssrn=2158530|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of not being paid a fair wage increases corruptibility and also reduces the moral costs of corruption.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klaus|first=Abbink|date=2000|title=Fair Salaries and the Moral Costs of Corruption|url=https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/78377|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model therefore suggests that even modest increases in salaries ensuring 'fair wages' can reduce civil servants' propensity to solicit and accept bribes.

The theoretical linkage between public salary increases and corruption remains ambiguous. In a context of constrained government fiscal resources, the question of [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] to design optimal wage policies arises. A cross-country study by Van Rijckeghem and Weder endeavours to find empirical support for the fair-wage and efficiency wage hypotheses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/30/Corruption-and-the-Rate-of-Temptation-Do-Low-Wages-in-the-Civil-Service-Cause-Corruption-2246|title=Corruption and the Rate of Temptation : Do Low Wages in the Civil Service Cause Corruption?|website=IMF|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude that relative government wages are negatively and significantly correlated with measures of corruption but that eradicating corruption would necessitate unrealistic increases in relative wages.  These correlations, however, cannot be interpreted as evidence of a causal relationship going from public sector wages to corruption. Causality may run in the [[Reverse causation|reverse]] direction, pervasive corruption has been shown to reduce tax revenue collection and public expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=Vito|last2=Davoodi|first2=Hamid R.|date=2000-11-01|title=Corruption, Growth, and Public Finances|ssrn=880260|language=en|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor public finance performance and strong budgetary pressures due to corruption may in turn sustain low civil service salaries. This [[Endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]] problem complicates the understanding of the relationship between pay reforms and corruption.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Klaus Abbink also tests the fair salary hypothesis in a laboratory experimental setting.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The controlled environment in this experiment allows to isolate and identify the impact of 'fair income' considerations on corrupt behaviour. He finds that public officials in two treatments with different perceptions of 'fairness' behave similarly in a bribery game. In other words, high relative public officials salaries do not alter decisions to be corrupt through fairness considerations. These experimental results substantiate Van Rijckeghem and Weder's findings and cast doubt on the cost-effectiveness of increasing public salaries to combat corruption.

Di Tella and Schargrodsky provide additional evidence with their micro-empirical analysis on wages and [[audit]]ing during a crackdown on corruption in [[Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires, Argentina]] in 1996-97.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Tella|first=Rafael|last2=Schargrodsky|first2=Ernesto|date=2003-04-01|title=The Role of Wages and Auditing during a Crackdown on Corruption in the City of Buenos Aires|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=269–292|doi=10.1086/345578|issn=0022-2186}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that wage increases can be effective only when combined with intermediate levels of monitoring intensity (the probability of detection in the shirking model). They test their hypotheses using variations in audit intensity during the crackdown on corruption in public hospitals and find that procurement officers’ wages alone have no statistically significant effect on corruption but detect a negative relationship when wages are interacted with audit intensity. The authors make the case that higher wages and monitoring (“carrots and sticks”) should be used simultaneously to act as an effectual anti-corruption strategy.

The literature on public officials' salaries and corruption offers mixed or inconclusive evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/dfid-research-outputs/what-is-the-evidence-of-the-impact-of-increasing-salaries-on-improving-the-performance-of-public-servants-including-teachers-nurses-and-mid-level-occupations-in-low-and-middle-income-countries-is-it-time-to-give-pay-a-chance|title=What is the evidence of the impact of increasing salaries on improving the performance of public servants?  Is it time to give pay a chance? - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to indicate that pay increases is a necessary but insufficient condition for curbing corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iie.org:443/en/Research-and-Insights/Publications/DFG-NU-LitReviewPublication|title=Combatting Corruption Among Civil Servants (2017)|website=iie|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wage hikes could also have varying effects depending on whether reforms focus on base-salary (unconditional) increases or performance-related pay increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasnain|first=Zahid|last2=Manning|first2=Nick|last3=Pierskalla|first3=Jan Henryk|date=2012|title=Performance-related Pay in the Public Sector: A Review of Theory and Evidence|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/6046|journal=World Bank Policy Research Working Papers|language=English|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decentralization ===
Following the dissatisfaction with [[Centralisation|centralized]] forms of [[governance]], decentralization of public service provision to [[Sub-national entity|sub-national]] governments became a global trend, particularly in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=World|date=1999|title=World Development Report 1999/2000|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5982|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Decentralization]] is the transfer of [[authority]], resources and responsibilities from higher to lower levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.ph/UNDP4/decentralization-and-power-shift-an-imperative-for-good-governance/index.html|title=Decentralization and Power Shift: An Imperative for Good Governance {{!}} UNDP|website=www.ombudsman.gov.ph|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and Rao&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gsdrc.org/topic-guides/decentralisation-and-local-government/|title=Decentralisation and local government - GSDRC|work=GSDRC|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  distinguish three types of decentralization:

*[[Administration (government)|Administrative]] decentralization refers to the ability of [[local government]]s to hire, fire and set terms of reference for their own employees and on the human resource management and government organization framework.
*Under [[Politics|Political]] or [[Democracy|Democratic]] Decentralization, power is transferred to lower levels of government, public officials are elected by local citizens and are accountable to citizens rather than to the central government.
*[[Fiscal policy|Fiscal]] Decentralization involves assigning responsibilities for [[expenditures]] and [[revenue]]s to local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/decentralization/fiscal.htm|title=Fiscal Decentralization|website=www1.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of fiscal decentralization varies according to local governments' ability to raise revenues and the extent to which they are given autonomy in allocating their expenditures.

Countries differ in their degree of administrative, political and fiscal decentralization. For instance, in [[China]] there is a devolution of administrative and fiscal responsibilities but no political decentralization whereas it is the opposite in [[India]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardhan|first=Pranab|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|date=2006|title=Decentralization, Corruption and Government Accountability: An Overview|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/bos/iedwpr/dp-152.html|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theoretical arguments supporting that decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption. To begin with, decentralization is believed to bring the government closer to its citizens and to improve the allocation of resources at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azfar|first=O|last2=Kähkönen|first2=S|last3=Lanyi|first3=A|last4=Meagher|first4=P|last5=Rutherford|first5=Diana|date=2004-01-01|title=Decentralization, Governance and Public Services: The Impact of Institutional Arrangements|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230557423|journal=Devolution and Development: Governance Prospects in Decentralizing States|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal output level of a local public good (at which citizens' [[Marginal utility|marginal benefit]] equals [[marginal cost]] of providing the good) varies across localities because of differences in preferences and costs. Considering that sub-national governments have better information about the preferences and circumstances of their constituencies, they can tailor the provision of public goods according to these preferences, thereby increasing efficiency and total welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oates|first=Wallace E|date=1999|title=An Essay on Fiscal Federalism|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=1120–1149|doi=10.1257/jel.37.3.1120|issn=0022-0515|citeseerx=10.1.1.195.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea goes back to [[Friedrich Hayek|F. Hayek's]] argument in his essay "[[The Use of Knowledge in Society]]" (1945). Hayek asserts that since knowledge is decentralized ("the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayek|first=F. A.|date=1945|title=The Use of Knowledge in Society|jstor=1809376|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=35|issue=4|pages=519–530}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows that decisions and control over resources should be decentralized (a necessary although not sufficient condition for achieving optimal allocation).

However, [[Principal–agent problem|principal-agent models]] demonstrate there can be tradeoffs in transferring [[decision-making]] responsibilities. Under these theoretical frameworks, central public officials are assumed to be public-spirited principals and local officials act as self-interested agents. On the one hand, [[public good]] delivery can be better adapted to local needs but on the other hand, the decisions are made by [[Principal–agent problem|agents]] whose interests differ from the [[Principal–agent problem|principal]]. Delegating [[authority]] can result in 'control loss' or 'abuse of power'. Decentralization can be more effective than centralized decision-making if the gains from adaptability can outweigh the control loss. The overall effects of decentralization on governance and [[welfare]] will therefore depend on the degree to which the principal's and agent's interests are opposed and the principal's ability to exert control over the agent's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melumad|first=Nahum|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|last3=Reichelstein|first3=Stefan|date=1997-06-01|title=Contract Complexity, Incentives, and the Value of Delegation |journal=Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=257–289|doi=10.1111/j.1430-9134.1997.00257.x|issn=1530-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that decentralization can enhance accountability in the service delivery mechanism. Local governments' proximity makes it more feasible for citizens to monitor and hold public officials accountable. The accountability mechanisms work through political decentralization. In a functional local democracy, local elections constitute an 'incomplete contract' enabling citizens to remove non-performing local officials from office.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, as Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, local democracy may not operate effectively in practice in developing countries and may be captured by local elites.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardhan|first=Pranab|last2=Mookherjee|first2=Dilip|date=2000|title=Corruption and Decentralization of Infrastructure Delivery in Developing Countries|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/bosecd/104.html|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, decentralization can reduce corruption by creating horizontal competition between local governments. [[Tiebout model|Tiebout]] make the case in a 1956 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiebout|first=Charles M.|date=1956-10-01|title=A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=64|issue=5|pages=416–424|doi=10.1086/257839|issn=0022-3808}}&lt;/ref&gt; that residents' and factors of production's mobility across localities can reduce the monopoly power exercised by local public officials with respect to regulations and bribes. Fiscal and political decentralization encourages inter-jurisdictional competition that pressures sub-national governments to efficiently deliver local public goods. If citizens are dissatisfied with their local government's performance, they can move to other regions, thereby decreasing tax revenues in less efficient jurisdictions. A similar argument concerning the relationship between a decentralized bureaucratic structure and bribe payments has been explored in the academic literature. [[Susan Rose-Ackerman|Rose-Ackerman]] suggests that a decentralized civil service can reduce bribery since [[competition]] between public officials would bid down bribe payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RVa0BQAAQBAJ|title=Corruption: A Study in Political Economy|last=Rose-Ackerman|first=Susan|date=2013-10-22|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9781483289069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishny and Shleifer further develop this argument, they build a model where citizens and businesses require more than one service or good from several public officials. If government services are substitutes, then the competitive regime still applies. However, when government services are complementary and in the case of a decentralized bureaucratic structure, firms or citizens are facing several independent bureaucrats. Decentralization might therefore lead to a lack of coordination among bribe-seeking bureaucrats and a "[[Tragedy of the commons|Tragedy of the Commons]]" outcome where public officials ask bribe payments that are too high, thereby increasing the burden that corruption imposes on firms and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shleifer|first=A.|last2=Vishny|first2=R. W.|date=1993-08-01|title=Corruption|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/108/3/599/1881822?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=599–617|doi=10.2307/2118402|issn=0033-5533|jstor=2118402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaby and Sylwester empirically test these hypotheses in a cross-country regression and find that bribe payments are higher under a more decentralized bureaucratic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-09-01|title=Bureaucratic competition and public corruption: Evidence from transition countries|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268014000408|journal=European Journal of Political Economy|language=en|volume=35|pages=75–87|doi=10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2014.04.002|issn=0176-2680|last1=Diaby|first1=Aboubacar|last2=Sylwester|first2=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Fisman and Gatti detect a strong negative correlation between fiscal decentralization (as measured by subnational share of total government spending) and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Fisman|last2=Roberta|first2=Gatti|date=2000|title=Decentralization and Corruption : Evidence across Countries|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/19852|journal=|language=en-US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treisman (2000) examines correlations between eight different measures of decentralization with various measures of corruption and service delivery performance. The same measure of fiscal decentralization used by Fisman and Gatti appears not to be significantly correlated with corruption measures.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/2000|title=Decentralization and the Quality of Government|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|date=2000|website=www.imf.org|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decentralization is a complex process which manifests itself in various forms. The design and impetus for decentralization are specific to each country, which complicates comparisons of a single conception of decentralization. The literature on decentralization experiences in several developing countries suggests the effects of decentralization on public sector performance and corruption are likely to be ambiguous and highly context-specific.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The empirical work appears to be inconclusive as various types of decentralization were examined using different measures. What's more, measuring corruption as bribery without paying attention to special interest [[Elite capture|capture]] may provide an inaccurate assessment of the impact of decentralization. As Bardhan and Mookherjee argue, bribery may decrease while being replaced by local elite capture as a result of decentralization.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Treisman purports that the theoretical and empirical arguments about decentralization and governance refer to specific types of decentralization. He identifies five types: structural, decision, resource, electoral and institutional decentralization and develops arguments clarifying how each type affects the quality of government.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While some types of decentralization can improve governance and reduce corruption, others can undermine government performance, this can in part explain the mixed empirical evidence on the effects of decentralization.

=== Top-Down Performance Monitoring ===
Rather than structuring rewards and penalties for corrupt behaviour, another approach to civil service reform seeks to increase the probability that corrupt activity will be observed. Theoretically,  monitoring can reduce [[Information asymmetry|information asymmetries]] so that the principal can induce the agent to choose the optimal level of effort and the optimal degree of corrupt activity. As the agent compares his expected payoff of being honest to that of being corrupt, increasing the probability of getting caught and punished will deter corrupt behaviour.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520074088|title=Controlling Corruption|last=Klitgaard|first=Robert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Chapter 3: Policy Measures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil service auditing by the principal or third parties serves an [[accountability]] function. The inherent conflict of interest as well as the lack of oversight require independent third parties to certify the reliability of financial reporting, performance results and compliance to rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/leading-practices/Pages/the-role-of-auditing-in-public-sector-governance.aspx|title=The Role of Auditing in Public Sector Governance|last=|first=|date=|website=na.theiia.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditors can help exercise oversight by evaluating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the delivery of government services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/33Performanceauditing.pdf|title=Public Sector Performance Auditing in Developing Countries|last=Warring|first=Colleen|last2=Morgan|first2=Stephen|date=2009|website=|access-date=|laydate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[audit]]s must rely on efficiency measures and pre-determined criteria and benchmarks to assess public servant's performance and the impact of government's programs. Performance auditing can also help detect corruption in public entities. Audits highlight irregularities and areas of inefficiencies that may indicate the existence of corruption. Based on suspicious circumstances, auditors can identify illegal behaviour and collect evidence on misdeeds which can subsequently be used to prosecute public servants at fault. As previously mentioned, successful detection efforts by performance auditing can have a deterrent effect on corrupt activities.

Auditing and prosecution were important elements in Justice Plana's campaign to curb corruption in the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the Philippines. Appointed as the new Commissioner of the corrupt Bureau of Internal Revenue, Justice Plana's anti-corruption strategy focused on implementing a new performance evaluation system, gathering information on corruption through intelligence agents and audits and effectively prosecuting corrupt tax officers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While Justice Plana's campaign was a multi-faceted approach, the higher monitoring intensity combined with a highly credible threat of punishment were particularly successful in deterring corrupt behaviour in the Bureau of Internal Revenue. According to Professor Magtolis-Briones, the threat of being detected and prosecuted decidedly lead officials to reconsider their decisions to engage in corrupt activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph:8081/bitstream/handle/0/4711/07_Negative%20Bureaucratic%20Behavior%20and%20Development.pdf?sequence=1|title=Negative Bureaucratic Behaviour and Development:The Case of the Bureau of Internal Revenue|last=Magtolis-Briones|first=Leonor|date=1979|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Georgia, the success of anti-corruption reforms especially relied on top-down monitoring and prosecution but Schueth warns about the potential abuses of monitoring when fighting corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-01|title=Apparatus of capture: Fiscal state formation in the republic of Georgia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811001880|journal=Political Geography|language=en|volume=31|issue=3|pages=133–143|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2011.11.004|issn=0962-6298|last1=Schueth|first1=Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crackdown on corruption in the tax agency involved coercion such as the use of extra-legal surveillance systems to ensure public officials' observance of the new procedural codes.

Laboratory experiments provide evidence on the impact monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-12-01|title=A controlled field experiment on corruption|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292111000389|journal=European Economic Review|language=en|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1072–1082|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2011.04.007|issn=0014-2921|last1=Armantier|first1=Olivier|last2=Boly|first2=Amadou}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a controlled bribery experiment in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Armantier and Boly observed that monitoring and punishment can be an effective anti-corruption policy. The researchers had two treatments, low monitoring and high monitoring.While the 'low monitoring' treatment proved effective in curbing bribery, they could not detect significant treatment effects on bribery in the 'high monitoring' treatment. The authors suggest that high monitoring intensity can crowd out intrinsic motivations to behave honestly.

Serra compare the effectiveness of top-down and bottom-up monitoring in a laboratory bribery game between public officials and private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serra|first=D.|date=2011-06-09|title=Combining Top-Down and Bottom-Up Accountability: Evidence from a Bribery Experiment|url=https://academic.oup.com/jleo/article-abstract/28/3/569/909949|journal=Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=569–587|doi=10.1093/jleo/ewr010|issn=8756-6222|citeseerx=10.1.1.594.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental results suggest that top-down auditing is ineffective in deterring bribery, this may be especially true in weak institutional environments. However, the researcher found that combining formal top-down auditing and bottom-up monitoring created an accountability mechanism that was effective in curbing corruption.

=== Bottom-Up Monitoring and Reforms ===
An alternative approach to improving governance and combating corruption that has gained prominence in recent years is encouraging grassroots participation by community members in local monitoring to induce bottom-up pressures for reform. The 2004 World Development Report: Making Services Work for Poor People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2003-09-30|title=World Development Report 2004 : Making services work for poor people - Overview|pages=1–36|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/527371468166770790/World-Development-Report-2004-Making-services-work-for-poor-people-Overview|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is centred on this grassroots approach to development. Community participation is now considered an important component of reforms aiming to improve public service delivery and corruption at the local level.&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Olken |first=Benjamin |title=Monitoring Corruption: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Indonesia |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=115 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=200–249 |doi=10.1086/517935 |citeseerx=10.1.1.144.6583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up models of governance involve community members participating in the service provision process by allowing them to monitor public officials, to have a say in policymaking, and keep service providers accountable to incentivize them to deliver public goods and services efficiently.

[[Joseph Stiglitz|J. Stiglitz]] argues that community members, as beneficiaries of public goods and services, will have more incentives to monitor and ensure that governments programs are successful compared to indifferent central bureaucrats. In particular, project involving local citizens will be more likely to succeed since community participation helps sustain efforts towards the long-term continuation of projects necessary to keep them effective.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|date=2002|title=Participation and Development: Perspectives from the Comprehensive Development Paradigm|journal=Review of Development Economics|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=163–182|doi=10.1111/1467-9361.00148|issn=1363-6669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, [[Benjamin Olken|B. Olken]] contends that grassroots monitoring for public goods and services may be impaired by a free-rider problem&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; and suggests that government provision of private goods (subsidized food or health care) may generate more incentives to monitor service provision as each community member has a personal interest in securing the effective delivery of goods and in minimizing extortion by public officials. Stiglitz indeed recognizes that grassroots monitoring of public good delivery is in itself a public good and that as such, it is under-provided.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A bottom-up project, the Citizen Report Card (CRC), pioneered by the NGO [[Public Affairs Centre India|Public Affairs Center]] (PAC) was implemented in 1993 in [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. This project aimed at gathering local citizens' feedback on civil service performance and publicizing the results through the media, thereby exerting public pressures for the public service to improve its performance and launch reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adikeshavalu|first=Ravindra|date=2004-06-01|title=An assessment of the impact of Bangalore citizen report cards on the performance of public agencies|pages=1–25|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/777451468752769088/An-assessment-of-the-impact-of-Bangalore-citizen-report-cards-on-the-performance-of-public-agencies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the report cards revealed low levels of citizens' satisfaction with service providers, and the expectation was that report cards would serve as an accountability mechanism that would bring forward issues of service provision quality and corruption levels in the public service. While this initiative did raise awareness on such issues, there was some but not dramatic improvement in service delivery quality between 1994 and 1999. However, the difficulty of measuring improvements in service quality other than through subjective measures restricts opportunities to rigorously evaluate this bottom-up initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01004/WEB/IMAGES/10850832.PDF|title=Making Voices: The Report Card on Bangalore's Public Services|last=Paul|first=Samuel|date=|website=|publisher=Public Affairs Center, Bangalore, India|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Participatory budgeting|Participatory Budgeting]] in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Brazil]] is known among scholars and policymakers as an enduring example of bottom-up reforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Participatory-budgeting-of-Porto-Alegre:-a-in-the-Utzig/b8f09942a1c783728ff4a76e16a37deca2f11998|title=Participatory budgeting of Porto Alegre: a discussion in the light of the principle of democratic legitimacy and of the criterion of governance performance - Semantic Scholar|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory budgeting allows citizens to voice their demands regarding service delivery improvements, and through negotiations to influence budget funds allocation at the municipality level. This project was initiated in 1989, and is said to have improved access to and the quality of public service provision, especially for lower segments of society.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; For instance, 27,000 new public housing units were created in 1989 (compared to only 1,700 in 1986), the number of schools quadrupled between 1986 and 1997 while the share of Porto Alegre's budget going to education and health went from 13% in 1985 to about 40% in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEMPOWERMENT/Resources/14657_Partic-Budg-Brazil-web.pdf|title=Participatory Budgeting in Brazil|last=Bhatnagar et al.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participatory budgeting still has to address some limitations, including lack of representation of the poorest, but its success has led other municipalities in Brazil and public entities in other countries to adopt this initiative.

== Evidence on Reform Effectiveness in Developing Countries ==

=== Pay Reforms Experiences ===

==== Base Salary Increases for Police Officers in Ghana ====
In 2010, the Ghanaian government implemented a civil service salary reform, the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS) to mitigate pay disparities in the public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=D.|first=Larbi, M.|title=The Implementation of the Single Spine Salary Structure (Ssss) in Ghana|date=2007|degree=|publisher=University of Ghana|url=http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/handle/123456789/8394|doi=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police officer]]s were the first beneficiaries of this new salary structure as the police service has historically been the least well-paid of public services in [[Ghana]]. Their wages unilaterally doubled in an attempt to increase their [[Standard of living|living standards]] to reduce [[bribery]] (fair-wage hypothesis). Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang assess the impact of this salary reform using a [[Difference in differences|difference-in-difference]] analysis taking advantage of the exogenous change induced by the policy.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

While police officers' wages doubled, the salaries of other civil servants in Ghana and police officers in [[Burkina Faso]] stayed the same. The researchers identified two groups, the Ghanaian policemen who received the treatment (higher wages) and the control group consisting of other civil servants (Ghanaian custom officers and Burkinabé policemen) whose wages did not increase.

Using data on bribes paid from 2,100 truck trips between Ghana and Burkina Faso,  Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang can observe the differences in interactions with truck drivers between the treated and the control group before the salary reform (2006-2010) and after the salary reform (2010-2012). If we assume group differences would have stayed constant in the absence of the reform ([[Difference in differences#Assumptions|parallel trend assumption]]), the difference-in-difference coefficient estimate measures the causal impact of the salary increase on Ghanaian police officers' propensity to ask for bribes. The results suggest that the salary reform counterintuively increased police officers' efforts to extort bribes, the value of the bribes and the total amount truck drivers had to pay on the road.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; This evidence goes against theoretical arguments on pay reforms in the civil service. Foltz and Opoku-Agyemang posit that these results could be due to the lack of enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Without changing the environment and other incentives facing civil servants, it appears that increasing wages may not have the predicted effects on corruption.

==== Pay for Performance Reforms for Tax Collectors in Pakistan ====
Corruption in tax administration has particularly detrimental effects on tax revenue collection, fiscal balance and overall economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ajaz|first=Tahseen|last2=Ahmad|first2=Eatzaz|date=2010|title=The Effect of Corruption and Governance on Tax Revenues|jstor=41428665|journal=The Pakistan Development Review|volume=49|issue=4|pages=405–417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan, Khwaja and Olken implemented a large-scale randomized experiment in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] to assess the impact of performance-based payment schemes for tax collectors.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Adnan Q. |last=Khan |first2=Asim I. |last2=Khwaja |first3=Benjamin A. |last3=Olken |year=2016 |title=Tax Farming Redux: Experimental Evidence on Performance Pay for Tax Collectors |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=219–271 |doi=10.1093/qje/qjv042 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/66265/1/Khan_Tax%20farming%20redux_2016.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the Punjab provincial government, they randomly allocated tax officials in the provincial urban property tax department into four groups, a control group and three treatment groups corresponding to different pay-for-performance designs.

The three treatment groups differed in the degree to which tax officers' pay was based on revenue collection performance and on other subjective evaluations from taxpayers and the tax department. The 'Revenue' treatment provided incentives depending only on revenue collection exceeding a benchmark while the 'Revenue Plus' scheme tied salaries to tax collection performance as well as accuracy of tax assessment and taxpayers' satisfaction. The last treatment 'Flexible Plus' added several criteria set by the tax department to determine wages. After two fiscal years, Khan, Khwaja and Olken found that across the three treatment groups, tax revenues increased by 9 log points on average which is equivalent to 46% higher growth of revenues compared to the control group.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

The 'Revenue' scheme was the most effective in increasing tax collection but the researchers found no effects on accuracy of tax assessment or the satisfaction of taxpayers. They note that pay-for-performance schemes may have tradeoffs: giving excessive incentives to tax officers might increase their bargaining power with taxpayers and lead to more extortion and taxpayers' dissatisfaction. However, Khan, Khwaja and Olken point out that the benefits of pay-for-performance contracts outweigh their costs and suggest they can effective in increasing tax revenue collection.

=== Monitoring Reforms ===

==== Random Audits in Brazilian Municipalities ====
In 2003, the federal government of Brazil created the [[Comptroller General of Brazil|Controladoria Geral da União]] (CGU) charged with corruption prevention and internal control. The CGU launched an anti-corruption program, Programa de Fiscalização por Sorteios Públicos (Monitoring Program with Public Lotteries), which consists in randomly selecting municipalities for audits and publicly disseminating the findings. As of 2015, 12 years after the beginning of the reform, there have been 2,241 audits in 1,949 municipalities.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Avis |first=Eric |last2=Ferraz |first2=Claudio |last3=Finan |first3=Frederico |date=July 2016 |title=Do Government Audits Reduce Corruption? Estimating the Impacts of Exposing Corrupt Politicians |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 22443 |doi=10.3386/w22443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Avis, Ferraz and Finan exploited the random selection to measure the impact of this anti-corruption program. While some municipalities had been audited several times in the past (treatment group), others were being audited for the first time (control group). Since the municipalities were randomly selected, comparing corruption levels among municipalities in the control and treatment group can provide causal estimates of the effects of the reform.

Based on audit reports, they estimate that 30% of the federal funds transferred to municipalities were stolen. However, they find that corruption levels were 8% lower in municipalities that had previously undergone government audits, thereby suggesting that random audits can be an effective policy against corruption. The researchers posit that random audits can reduce corruption by increasing public officials' perceived probability of being detected. They observed that audits also generated spillover effects, neighbouring municipalities were also affected, having an additional neighbour audited decreased their corruption levels by 7.5%.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The local media played a role in disseminating information about other municipalities' audit outcomes.

Avis et al. identify several mechanisms through which the audits led to lower local corruption. First, the new program introduce a system of political accountability whereby local citizens can punish or reward (dis)honest incumbents. Audits may have also altered the types of candidates who enter into politics. What's more, negative audit results can generate reputational costs and potential legal punishments.

==== Monitoring a Road Building Project in Indonesia ====
The Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) is an Indonesian government program, financed by the World Bank which funds village-level small-scale infrastructure programs. [[Benjamin Olken]] implemented a randomized experiment in which he randomly assigned 608 villages into groups with different audit probabilities prior to the start of a nationwide infrastructure project.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

A random sample of villages were informed that the project would be audited by an audit agency once completed. This increased the probability of detection from 4% to 100%. The audit results were publicly disseminated by the auditors during village meetings. Olken also designed experiments to increase local members' participation in 'accountability meetings' where officials in charge of the road-building project expose how the budget will be spent.

To assess the impact of both monitoring mechanisms, the researcher uses a quantitative measure of corruption levels based on engineers' assessment of the quantity of materials used to build the roads and estimated costs. The discrepancies between project’s official costs reported by village project leaders and the costs estimated by independent engineers measures missing expenditures which are used as a proxy for corruption in Olken's study. It was estimated that on average 24% of materials were missing based on road samples, suggesting that part of the project funds were diverted. Olken finds that increasing the probability of external audits significantly reduced missing expenditures (by 8%), and that this approach to fighting corruption is cost-effective.&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Top-down audits were more effective when village elections were close, which implies that local level accountability can be effective in restraining corrupt behaviour. However, the interventions to increase grassroots participation did not have any significant effects on missing funds.

== Challenges and Barriers to Effective Civil Service Reforms ==
[[Political economy]] dynamics condition the success of civil service reforms. [[Douglass North|North]] et al. argue that some developing countries function as 'limited access orders' in which [[elite]]s exclude broad cross-sections of society to maintain an equilibrium that enables them to extracts rents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=North|first=Douglass C.|last2=Wallis|first2=John Joseph|last3=Webb|first3=Steven B.|last4=Weingast|first4=Barry R.|date=2007-11-09|title=Limited Access Orders In The Developing World :A New Approach To The Problems Of Development|journal=Policy Research Working Papers|language=en|doi=10.1596/1813-9450-4359|issn=1813-9450}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such an equilibrium, political elites have no incentives to break down their patronage networks and introduce [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] recruitment reforms in the civil service as it would threaten their position and reduce their opportunities for [[rent-seeking]]. The [[Clientelism|clientelist]] system on the contrary can be a powerful mechanism through which elites maintain this 'limited access order'. Considerably depending on clientelist and [[patronage]] networks increases the costs of implementing public sector reforms. Elites will therefore be likely to oppose reforms as they stand to lose the most.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geddes|first=Barbara|date=1991|title=A Game Theoretic Model of Reform in Latin American Democracies|jstor=1963165|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=85|issue=2|pages=371–392|doi=10.2307/1963165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What's more, civil service reforms are costly to implement in the short-term while their benefits will be manifested and reaped in the future. Governments are thus unwilling to make such unappealing investment. The long-term nature of reforms and the reluctance to initiate, gather and maintain support for reforms prevent their implementation in the first place. In a background paper for the 2011 World Bank Development Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lant|first=Pritchett|last2=Frauke|first2=de Weijer|date=2011|title=Fragile States : Stuck in a Capability Trap?|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/9109|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; de Weijer and Pritchett appraise that it would take about 20 years to witness improvements in the functional capability of the state. In almost every countries, this exceeds the average duration of a term of office, political incumbents would have no incentives to incur the costs to carry out reforms while the benefits will accrue to future incumbents.

In addition, bureaucratic inertia and resistance to change should not be overlooked. Bureaucrats may be disinclined to accept changes brought by civil service reforms. This is especially true in countries where bureaucrats depend on informal or illegal channels to complement their meager salaries.&lt;ref name=":142"/&gt;

Institutional structures or types of political regimes also matter for reform implementation and success. In a democratic regime, political incumbents may see it in their interests to initiate bureaucratic reforms if voters value and acknowledge the public benefits of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/corruption-and-government/domestic-conditions-for-reform/8B269276F411CD2BA57F1F87E534D02E|title=Domestic Conditions for Reform (Chapter 13) - Corruption and Government|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2018-04-26|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, demand for civil service reforms remains weak in developing countries. Even if bureaucratic corruption is condemned across countries, the internal demand for anti-corruption reforms is undermined by a [[collective action problem]]. Indeed, Persson, Rohstein and Teorell argue that civil service reforms have failed as a result of their mischaracterization of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Anna|last2=Rothstein|first2=Bo|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2012-09-07|title=Why Anticorruption Reforms Fail-Systemic Corruption as a Collective Action Problem|journal=Governance|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=449–471|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2012.01604.x|issn=0952-1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most approaches to civil service reform rely on principal-agent frameworks that assume that 'principled principals' are public-spirited and will always take on the task to fight corruption and improve bureaucratic performance. However, the authors contend that, in contexts where corruption is pervasive, actors will not necessarily respond to incentives aiming at altering their behaviour but instead behave based on the extent to which corruption is the expected behaviour in society.

'''Daniel Ek''' (born 21 February 1983) is a Swedish [[billionaire]] entrepreneur and technologist. Ek is best known as the co-founder and CEO of the music streaming service [[Spotify]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-14/spotify-wins-over-music-pirates-with-labels-approval-correct-.html|title=Spotify’s Ek Wins Over Music Pirates With Labels’ Approval|publisher=Bloomberg|author=Brendan Greeley|date=14 Jul 2011|accessdate=3 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life ==
Ek grew up in Rågsved, Stockholm, Sweden.

== Education ==
Ek graduated from the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] &lt;small&gt;([[:sv:IT-Gymnasiet|sv]])&lt;/small&gt; in [[Sundbyberg]] in 2002, and subsequently studied engineering at the [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] before dropping out to focus on his IT career. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/01/04/spotifys-daniel-ek-the-most-important-man-in-music/3/#c16c443218ed |title=Spotify's Daniel Ek: The Most Important Man In Music}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
===Early ventures===
Ek's first foray into the business world began at age 13 when he started a business making websites for clients from his home. He charged the first client $100, but then charged the next client who asked $200. Eventually, he started charging $5,000 per website. To help expand the business, Ek recruited students from his class to work on the websites from the school computer lab by bribing them with video games. His earnings eventually reached $50,000 per month and by age 18 he was managing a team of 25. Ek's parents started to notice his earnings once he started bringing home large TVs.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pando.com/2012/11/08/daniel-eks-impossible-thinking-started-at-age-13-with-a-web-development-mini-empire/ |title=Daniel Ek's "impossible thinking" started at age 13 with a Web development mini-empire | accessdate=2017-12-06}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ek later served in a senior role at Nordic auction company [[Tradera]] which was acquired by [[Ebay]] in 2006. Ek also served as the [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of browser based game and fashion community [[Stardoll]]. Ek later started another company Advertigo, an online advertising company. Advertigo sold to [[TradeDoubler]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/7259509/Daniel-Ek-profile-Spotify-will-be-worth-tens-of-billions.html |title=Daniel Ek profile: 'Spotify will be worth tens of billions' | accessdate=6 Dec 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After selling Advertigo, Ek briefly became the CEO of [[μTorrent]], working with μTorrent founder [[Ludvig Strigeus]]. This ended when μTorrent was sold to [[BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent]] on December 7 of 2006. Strigeus would later join Ek as a Spotify developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/spotify-reminded-of-utorrent-past-after-branding-grooveshark-pirates-141112/|title=Spotify Reminded of uTorrent Past After Branding Grooveshark ‘Pirates’|publisher=Torrent Freak|author=Andy|date=12 Nov 2014|accessdate=3 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spotify===
The sale of Advertigo as well as his previous work made Ek wealthy enough that he decided to retire. However, after a few months Ek realized that money was meaningless without a project he was passionate about which led to the founding of Spotify.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Ek first had the idea for Spotify in 2002 when peer-to-peer music service [[Napster]] shut down and another illegal site [[Kazaa]] took over. Ek said he "realised that you can never legislate away from piracy. Laws can definitely help, but it doesn't take away the problem. The only way to solve the problem was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry – that gave us Spotify."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Ek incorporated [[Spotify]] AB with [[Martin Lorentzon]] in Stockholm, Sweden in 2006. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/24/spotify-revenue-up-operating-loss-widens/|title=Spotify Subscriptions Boost Revenue But Operating Loss Widens|publisher=Fortune|author=Reuters|date=24 May 2016|accessdate=3 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorentzon had previously worked at and co-founded [[TradeDoubler]] which had acquired Ek's previous company Advertigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6590101/daniel-ek-spotify-ceo-streaming-feature-tidal-apple-record-labels-taylor-swift|title=Billboard Cover: Spotify CEO Daniel Ek on Taylor Swift, His 'Freemium' Business Model and Why He's Saving the Music Industry |publisher=Billboard|author= Robert Levine |date=5 Jun 2015|accessdate=3 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, the company launched its legal music streaming service [[Spotify]]. Initially, Spotify ran on a peer-to-peer distribution model, similar to uTorrent, but switched to a server-client model in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/04/16/spotify-gives-up-on-p2p-technology-for-music-streaming/|title=Spotify gives up on P2P technology for music streaming|publisher=GigaOm|author=Janko Roettgers|date=16 Apr 2014|accessdate=3 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ek serves as CEO of Spotify.&lt;ref name="Spotify"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/daniel-ek |title=Spotify Information |accessdate=2009-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Spotify Co-Founder Martin Lorentzon announced he would be stepping down as Chairman and Ek would be taking over alongside his current role as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/14/spotify-co-founder-martin-lorentzon-steps-down-as-chairman-ceo-daniel-ek-steps-up/|title=Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon steps down as chairman, CEO Daniel Ek steps up|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2017, Spotify has 140 million active users and has raised over $2.5 billion in venture funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/15/15807826/spotify-140-million-active-users |title=Spotify now has 140 million active users |author=Micah Singleton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spotify |title=Spotify on Crunchbase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Daniel Ek was named as the most powerful person in the music industry by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/10/spotify-daniel-ek-most-powerful-person-music-business|title=Spotify's Daniel Ek named most powerful person in the music business|last=music|first=Guardian|date=2017-02-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
In 2016, Ek and fellow Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon wrote an open letter on the blogging platform [[Medium_(website) | Medium]] to the Swedish government saying that if certain changes to Swedish law regarding housing, taxation, and education are not made Spotify will be forced to re-locate from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/661319/sweden-must-change-quickly-spotify-threatens-to-leave-the-country/ |title=Sweden must change quickly”: Spotify threatens to leave the country}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, Ek claims that the high taxes in Sweden on stock options makes it difficult to incentivize programmers to work at startups when startups have trouble competing with larger companies on salary. Moreover, Ek claims Swedish permitting policy is overly restrictive limiting the supply of affordable housing. Opponents of Ek, however, have argued Spotify is hypocritically moving many jobs to [[New York City]] which has many of the same affordability issues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.eu/list/politico-28-class-of-2017-ranking/daniel-ek/ |title=Daniel Ek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2016, Ek married Sofia Levander, his longtime partner, at [[Lake Como]]. At Ek's wedding [[Bruno Mars]] was invited to perform and [[Chris Rock]] officiated; he invited numerous guests, including [[Mark Zuckerberg]].&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7685308/no-1-power-100-daniel-ek-spotify|title=Billboard Power 100's New No. 1: Spotify Streaming Pioneer Daniel Ek|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ek and his wife have two children together.

==Net worth==
It was reported in 2016 that Ek owns approximately $825 million of Spotify, when it was valued at $8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-co-founders-own-1-8bn-stake-in-company-say-estimates/ |title=Spotify Co-founders Own an Estimated $1.8bn Stake in Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spotify has since been valued at $16 billion which would put Ek's share at $1.6 billion assuming he has not sold any of his stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spotify-listing-exclusive/exclusive-spotifys-valuation-turned-up-to-16-billion-in-private-trades-sources-idUSKCN1C226W |title=Exclusive: Spotify's valuation turned up to $16 billion in private trades - sources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the '''de Dietrich''' family has been linked to that of France and of Europe for over three centuries.
To this day, the company that bears the family name continues to play a major role in the economic life of [[Alsace]].
De Dietrich is a holding company based in France which traces its history back to 1684. The incumbent chairman of the supervisory board Marc-Antoine de Dietrich represents the 11th consecutive generation at the helm of the company.
De Dietrich has been active in the automobile, railway and industrial equipment industry amongst others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2920">'''Domar aggregation''' is an approach to aggregating growth measures associated with industries to make larger sector or national aggregate growth rates. The issue comes up in the context of [[national accounts]] and [[multifactor productivity]] (MFP)statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econterms.com/econtent.html#Domar%20aggregation Domar aggregation] at Online Glossary of Research Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective is to construct the growth rate of an aggregate MFP, a sector or national total, as a weighted average of the MFP growth rates of its component industries, usually in order to discuss how the industry-specific changes affected the aggregate. The weights on each industry are called '''Domar weights'''.  The Domar weight for each industry when adding their MFPs together are the ratios of the nominal value of each industry's [[gross output]] to the sum of value-added output of all the industries together.&lt;ref name=hulten78/&gt;&lt;ref name=zheng/&gt;  The objective is to properly account for effects of productivity changes in intermediate goods and industries whose goods are both output and inputs for other industries.  By construction, Domar weights sum up to a figure larger than 1.0.&lt;ref name=hulten78/&gt;  The term "market value of the industry's output" can be used in place of the accounting term "gross output."&lt;ref name=hulten78/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pirkko Aulin-Ahmavaara; Perttu Pakarinen. 2004. [http://www.euklems.net/pub/no8.pdf Industry Level and Aggregate Measures of Productivity Growth with Explicit Treatment of Taxes on Products]. Statistics Finland.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This methodology was introduced by [[Evsey Domar]] (1961).&lt;ref&gt;Domar, Evsey D. On the Measurement of Technological Change, 1961, ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' 71:284 (Dec., 1961), 709-729. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/2228246 jstor])&lt;/ref&gt;  Economist [[Charles Hulten]] developed this theory more formally in a model of a closed economy.&lt;ref name=hulten78&gt;Hulten, Charles R. 1978 Growth accounting with intermediate inputs. ''[[Review of Economic Studies]]'', 45:3, 511-518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zheng&gt;Simon Zheng. 2004.

Working paper, Australian Bureau of Statistics, especially pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Hulten (1978) used "observed expenditure shares" as weights, and in that model "the first-order impact on output of a TFP shock to a firm or an industry is equal to that industry or firm’s sales as a share of output."&lt;ref&gt;David Rezza Baqaee; Emmanuel Farhi. 2017.

'''Downtown''' is the largest business district in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], located near the geographic center of the metropolitan area at the confluence of [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]], [[Interstate 45]], and [[Interstate 69]]. The {{convert|1.84|mi2|km2|adj=on}} district, enclosed by the aforementioned highways, contains the original townsite of Houston at the confluence of [[Buffalo Bayou]] and [[White Oak Bayou]], a point known as [[Allen's Landing]]. Downtown has been the city's preeminent commercial district since its founding in 1836.

Today home to nine [[Fortune 500]] corporations, Downtown contains {{convert|50|e6ft2|m2}} of office space and is the workplace of 150,000 employees.&lt;ref name="DD" /&gt; Downtown is also a major destination for entertainment and recreation. Nine major performing arts organizations are located within the 13,000-seat [[Houston Theater District|Theater District]] at prominent venues including [[Alley Theatre]], [[Hobby Center for the Performing Arts]], [[Jones Hall]], and the [[Wortham Theater Center]]. Two major professional sports venues, [[Minute Maid Park]] and the [[Toyota Center]], are home to the [[Houston Astros]] and [[Houston Rockets]], respectively. [[Discovery Green]], an urban park located on the east side of the district adjacent to the [[George R. Brown Convention Center]], anchors the city's convention district.

Downtown is Houston's civic center, containing [[Houston City Hall]], the [[Harris County Jail|jail]], criminal, and civil courthouses of [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], and [[Federal Detention Center, Houston|a federal prison]] and courthouse. Downtown is also a major public transportation hub, lying at the center of the [[METRORail|light rail system]], [[park and ride]] system, and the metropolitan freeway network; the [[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County]] (METRO) is headquartered in the district. Over 100,000 people commute through Downtown daily.&lt;ref name="DD" /&gt; An extensive [[Houston Downtown Tunnel System|network of pedestrian tunnels]] and skywalks connects a large number of buildings in the district; this system also serves as a subterranean mall.

Geographically, Downtown is bordered by [[East Downtown Houston|East Downtown]] to the east, [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]] to the south, [[Midtown, Houston|Midtown]] to the southwest, [[Fourth Ward, Houston|Fourth Ward]] to the west, [[Sixth Ward, Houston|Sixth Ward]] to the northwest, and [[Near Northside, Houston|Near Northside]] to the north. The district's streets form a strict [[grid plan]] of approximately 400 square blocks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.downtownhouston.org/site_media/uploads/attachments/2014-01-06/Block_Map_2014_1.pdf|title=Downtown Houston Block Numbering (HCAD)|last=|first=|date=January 2014|website=Downtown District|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209125341/http://downtownhouston.org/site_media/uploads/attachments/2014-01-06/Block_Map_2014_1.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; oriented at a southwest to northeast angle. The northern end of the district is crossed by Buffalo Bayou, the banks of which function as a [[linear park]] with a grade-separated system of hike-and-bike trails.

[[File:TownofHoustonHistory.JPG|thumb|Marker in Downtown Houston commemorating the founding of Houston by the Allen Brothers]]

Downtown Houston encompasses the original townsite of Houston. After the [[Texas Revolution]], two New York real estate investors, [[John Kirby Allen]] and [[Augustus Chapman Allen]], purchased {{convert|6642|acres|0|abbr=on}} of land from Thomas F.L. Parrot and his wife, Elizabeth ([[John Austin (soldier)|John Austin]]'s widow), for US$9,428 ({{inflation|US|9428|1836|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpa85|title=PARROTT, THOMAS F. L.|last=HOWARD|first=LIVINGSTON, RONALD|date=2010-06-15|website=tshaonline.org|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Allen brothers settled at the confluence of [[White Oak Bayou|White Oak]] and [[Buffalo Bayou|Buffalo]] bayous, a spot now known as [[Allen's Landing]].

A team of three surveyors, including [[Gail Borden, Jr.]] (best known for inventing [[condensed milk]]) and [[Moses Lapham]], platted a 62-square-block townsite in the fall of 1836, each block approximately 250 by 250 feet, or  {{convert|62500|ft2|m2}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstontx.gov/planning/HistoricPres/landmarks/11PL103_Stuart_Bldg_304_Main_St.pdf|title=Protected Landmark Designation Report – Stuart Building|last=|first=|date=2011-03-21|website=|publisher=City of Houston|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[grid plan]] was designed to conform to the winding route of Buffalo Bayou; east-west streets were aligned at an angle of north 55º west, while north-south streets were at an angle of south 35º west.&lt;ref name="Glass"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glass|first=James L.|date=1994|title=The Original Book of Sales of Lots in the Houston Town Company from 1836 Forward|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/16.3-The-Original-Book-fo-Sales-of-Lots-of-the-Houston-Town-Company-from-1836-Forward-James-Glass.pdf|journal=The Houston Review|volume=16|pages=167–194|via=Houston History Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each block was subdivided into 12 lots – five 50-by-100 foot lots on each side of the block, and two 50-by-125 foot lots between the rows of five.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; The Allen brothers, motivated by their vision for urban civic life, specified wide streets to easily accommodate commercial traffic and reserved blocks for schools, churches, and civic institutions.&lt;ref name="Hogg"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hogg Family and Houston: Philanthropy and the Civic Ideal|last=Kirkland|first=Kate Sayan|first2=|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2009|isbn=9780292748460|location=Austin, Texas|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The townsite was then cleared and drained by a team of Mexican prisoners and [[History of slavery in Texas|black slaves]].&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt; By April 1837, Houston featured a dock, commercial district, the capitol building of the [[Republic of Texas]], and an estimated population of 1,500.&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt; The first city hall was sited at present-day [[Market Square Park]] in 1841; this block also served as the city's preeminent retail market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketsquarepark.com/site_media/uploads/files/2011-03/Back_to_the_Future.pdf|title=Back to the Future|last=Theis|first=David|date=2010|website=Market Square Park|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relocation of the Texan republic's capital to Houston required a significant political campaign by the Allen brothers. The Allens gifted a number of city blocks to prominent Texas politicians and agreed to construct the new capitol building and a large hotel at no cost to the government.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; The Allens also donated blocks to celebrities, relatives, prominent lawyers, and other influential people in order to attract additional investment and speculation to the town.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; During the late 1830s and early 1840s, Houston was in the midst of a [[real estate bubble|land boom]], and lots were selling at "enormous prices," according to a visitor to the town in 1837.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt;

Despite the efforts of the Allen brothers and high economic interest in the town, first few years of Houston's existence were plagued by [[yellow fever]] epidemics, flooding, searing heat, inadequate infrastructure, and crime.&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt; Houston suffered from woefully inadequate city services; the Allens failed to accommodate transit, water service, sewerage, road paving, trash service, or gas service in their plans.&lt;ref name="Glass" /&gt; As a result, in 1839 the Texas Capitol was moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref name="Hogg" /&gt;

In 1840, Houston adopted a [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward system]] of municipal governance, which, at the time, was considered more democratic than a [[Mayor–council government|strong-mayor system]] and had already been adopted by the United States' largest cities.&lt;ref name="Trapp"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Betty Trapp|date=Fall 2010|title=A System of Government Where Business Ruled|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ward-system-of-government.pdf|journal=Houston History Magazine|volume=8|pages=29–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries of the original four wards of Houston radiated out from the intersection of Main and Congress streets; the First Ward was located to the northwest, Second to the northeast, Third to the southeast, and Fourth to the southwest.&lt;ref name="Trapp" /&gt; Fifth Ward was created in 1866, encompassing the area north of Buffalo Bayou and east of White Oak Bayou; Sixth Ward, the final addition to the system, replaced the section of Fourth Ward north of Buffalo Bayou in 1877.&lt;ref name="Trapp" /&gt; The ward system, which featured elected [[aldermen]] who served as representatives of each neighborhood, remained Houston's form of municipal government until 1905, when the city switched to a [[city commission government|commission government]] and the wards, as political entities, were dissolved.&lt;ref name="Trapp" /&gt;

Houston grew steadily thorughout the late 19th century, and the neighborhoods within the boundaries of modern Downtown diversified. To the northeast, around present-day [[Minute Maid Park]], Quality Hill emerged as an elite neighborhood, occupied by entrepreneurs like [[William Marsh Rice]] (namesake of [[Rice University]]), [[William J. Hutchins]], and William L. Foley (namesake of [[Foley's]] department stores).&lt;ref name="Sturrock"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturrock|first=Sidonie|date=Spring 2015|title=Uncovering the Story of Quality Hill, Houston’s First Elite Residential Neighborhood: A Detective on the Case|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Quality-Hill.pdf|journal=Houston History Magazine|volume=12-2|pages=7–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood was well known for its opluent residential architecture, often in the [[Greek Revival]] style.&lt;ref name="Sturrock" /&gt; To the north, along a bend in Buffalo Bayou, the working-class neighborhood of Frost Town welcomed immigrants from Europe and Mexico during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Frost-Town-a-peek-into-past-9203176.php|title=Frost Town offers a peek into the past|last=George|first=Cindy|date=2016-09-04|website=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the arrival of the first [[streetcar]]s in Houston in the 1870s, most development in the city had been centered in and around the present-day Downtown area. One of the first systems, the Houston City Street Railway, opened in 1874 with four lines along the principal commercial thoroughfares in the heart of the business district.&lt;ref name="Baron"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baron|first=Steven|date=1994|title=Streetcars and the Growth of Houston|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/16.2-Streetcars-and-the-Growth-of-Houston-Steven-M-Baron.pdf|journal=The Houston Review|volume=16|pages=67–100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While generally focused on the most prosperous areas of town, the Houston City Street Railway extended one line a full mile south of the center of the city, making it the first streetcar network designed to spur residential development.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; By the 1890s, new, larger local streetcar companies finally accumulated the capital necessary to begin constructing [[streetcar suburb]]s beyond the conventional boundaries of the city.&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; This led to the development and rapid growth of areas like the [[Houston Heights]] and [[Montrose, Houston|Montrose]].&lt;ref name="Baron" /&gt; Residential development subsequently moved out of the central business district; Quality Hill was virtually abandoned by the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Sturrock" /&gt;

Downtown's growth can be attributed to two major factors:  The first arose after the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900]], when investors began seeking a location close to the ports of Southwest Texas, but apparently free of the dangerous hurricanes that frequently struck Galveston and other port cities.  Houston became a wise choice, as only the most powerful storms were able to reach the city.  The second came a year later with the 1901 discovery of oil at [[Spindletop]], just south of [[Beaumont, Texas]].  Shipping and oil industries began flocking to east Texas, many settling in Houston. From that point forward the area grew substantially, as many skyscrapers were constructed, including the city's tallest buildings. In the 1980s, however, economic recession canceled some projects and caused others to be scaled back, such as the [[Bank of the Southwest Tower]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=bankofstreetsouthwesttower-houston-tx-usa Information from Emporis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century much of what was the [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]], the present day east side of Downtown Houston, was what Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who lectured at [[Rice University]], referred to as "the elite neighborhood of late 19th-century Houston." Ralph Bivins of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote that Fox said&lt;!--While Fox actually said it, the wording is Bivins'--&gt; that area was "a silk-stocking neighborhood of Victorian-era homes." Bivins said that the construction of Union Station, which occurred around 1910, caused the "residential character" of the area to "deteriorate." Hotels opened in the area to service travelers. Afterwards, according to Bivins, the area "began a long downward slide toward the skid row of the 1990s" and the hotels devolved into [[flophouse]]s. Passenger trains stopped going to [[Union Station (Houston)|Union Station]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Bivins, Ralph.

Beginning in the 1960s the development of the [[610 Loop]] caused the focus of the Houston area to move away from Downtown Houston. Joel Barna of ''Cite 42'' said that this caused [[Greater Houston]] to shift from "a fragmenting but still centrally focused spatial entity into something more like a doughnut," and that Downtown Houston began to become a "hole" in the "doughnut." As interchange connections with the 610 Loop opened, according to Barna Downtown "became just another node in a multi-node grid" and, as of 1998, "has been that, with already established high densities and land prices." In the mid-1980s, the bank [[savings and loan crisis]] forced many tenants in Downtown Houston buildings to retrench, and some tenants went out of business. Barna said that this development further caused Downtown Houston to decline.&lt;ref name="Barna73"&gt;Barna, Joel Warren.

The [[Gulf Hotel fire]] occurred in 1943.

Areas which are now considered part of Downtown were once within [[Third Ward, Houston, Texas|Third]] and the [[Fourth Ward, Houston, Texas|Fourth]] wards; the construction of Interstate 45 in the 1950s separated the areas from their former communities and placed them in Downtown. Additional freeway construction in the 1960s and 1970s solidified the current boundaries of Downtown. Originally, Downtown was the most important retail area of Houston. Suburban retail construction in the 1970s and 1980s reduced Downtown's importance in terms of retail activity.&lt;ref name="Study11" /&gt;

On April 5, 1986, the entire Downtown area was transformed as part of a concert by French musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]]. Called [[Rendez-Vous Houston]], the open-air show used the skyscrapers as giant projection screens, and as launchpads for fireworks.

In recent years, Downtown has experienced a boom in high-rise residential construction, spurred in large part by the Downtown Living Initiative (DLI), a tax incentive program created by the city. Between 2013 and 2015, the DLI subsidized 5,000 proposed residential units. As a result, Downtown's residential population has increased to 10,165 people in 4,777 units, up from 900 units in the 1995.&lt;ref name="DD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barna72"&gt;Barna, Joel Warren.

In the 1960s, downtown comprised a modest collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown into one of the largest [[skyline]]s in the United States. In 1960, the central business district had 10 million square feet (930,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of office space, increasing to about 16&amp;nbsp;million square feet (1,500,000&amp;nbsp;m²) in 1970. Downtown Houston was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with 8.7&amp;nbsp;million square feet (800,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of office space planned or under construction and huge projects being launched by [[real estate developer]]s. The largest proposed development was the 32-block [[Houston Center]]. Only a small part of the original proposal was ultimately constructed, however. Other large projects included the Cullen Center, Allen Center, and towers for [[Shell Oil Company]]. The surge of skyscrapers mirrored the skyscraper booms in other cities, such as Los Angeles and [[Dallas]]. Houston experienced another downtown construction spurt in the 1970s with the energy industry boom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

[[File:Chase Tower, a block away.jpg|150px|thumb|[[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]]]]
The first major skyscraper to be constructed in Houston was the 50-floor, 218&amp;nbsp;m (714&amp;nbsp;ft) [[One Shell Plaza]] in 1971. A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s, culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, 305&amp;nbsp;m (1,002&amp;nbsp;ft) [[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]] (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), which was completed in 1982. In 2002, it was the tallest structure in Texas, ninth-tallest building in the United States, and the 23rd tallest skyscraper in the world. In 1983, the 71-floor, 296&amp;nbsp;m (970&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Wells Fargo Plaza (Houston)|Wells Fargo Plaza]] was completed, which became the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas, and 11th-tallest in the country. Skyscraper construction in downtown Houston came to an end in the mid-1980s with the collapse of Houston's energy industry and the resulting economic recession.

Twelve years later, the Houston-based [[Enron Corporation]] began constructing a 40-floor, 1,284,013sq.ft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1500 Louisiana St|url=https://www.credifi.com/ui/freemium/propertydetails/1500-Louisiana-St-Houston-TX/552e5ac5cbda711f18d1c172|website=CrediFi|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; skyscraper in 1999 (which was completed in 2002)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/US/TX/HoustonEnronSouth.html Architecture of Enron Center South – Houston, Texas, United States of America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with the company collapsing in one of the most dramatic corporate failures in the history of the United States only two years later.  Chevron bought this building to set up a regional upstream energy headquarters, and in late 2006 announced further consolidation of employees downtown from satellite suburban buildings, and even California and Louisiana offices by leasing the original Enron building across the street.  Both buildings are connected by a second-floor unique walk-across, air-conditioned circular skybridge with three points of connection to both office buildings and a large parking deck.  Other smaller office structures were built in the 2000–2003 period. As of January 2015, downtown Houston had more than 44 million square feet (4,087,733&amp;nbsp;m²) of office space, including more than 29&amp;nbsp;million square feet (1,861,704&amp;nbsp;m²) of [[Class A office|class A]] office space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstondowntown.com/Home/Business/DoingBusiness/DowntownFacts1/Downtown%20Facts.PDF Microsoft Word – 02-FactSheet .doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.downtownhouston.org/site_media/uploads/attachments/2015-02-24/Why_Downtown_15-1-26_1.pdf|title=Why downtown?|website=www.downtownhouston.org|access-date=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable buildings that form Houston's downtown skyline:

* The [[Sweeney, Coombs, and Fredericks Building]] is a late Victorian commercial building with a 3-story corner turret and Eastlake decorative elements that was designed by George E. Dickey in 1889.

Gus Fredericks joined the Sweeney and Coombs Jewelry firm before 1889.  The building is on the corner of Main Street and Congress Street at 301 Main Street.  The jewelry firm is still in business.  It is one of the very few Victorian structures in the Bayou City.

* The [[Houston City Hall]] was started in 1938 and completed in 1939. The original building is an excellent example of the [[Art Deco]] Era.  In front of City Hall is the George Hermann Square.
*The [[Alley Theatre]] was completed in 1968. It is home to the [[Tony Award]] winning theatre company by the same name, the oldest professional theatre company in Texas. It's nine towers and brutality style give it a castle appearance. 
*[[One Shell Plaza]] was, at its completion in 1971, the tallest building in Houston.  It stands {{convert|715|ft|m}} tall, and when the antenna tower on its top is included, the height of One Shell Plaza is {{convert|1000|ft|m}}.
*[[Houston Public Library]]'s Central Library, consists of two separate buildings: the [[Julia Ideson]] Building (1926) and the [[Jesse H. Jones]] Building (1976).
* The [[Houston Industries Building]], formerly known as the 1100 Milam Building, was built in 1973. It went through major renovations in 1996.
* [[Pennzoil Place]], designed by [[Philip Johnson]], built in 1976, is Houston's most award-winning skyscraper, known for its innovative design.  Johnson's forward thinking brought about a new era in skyscraper design.
* The [[First City Tower]] was built in 1981.
*The [[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]], designed by [[I.M. Pei]], was built in 1981. Formerly the Texas Commerce Tower, it is the tallest in Houston and the second tallest in the United States west of the [[Mississippi River]].[[File:Thomas Scanlan Building, Houston, Texas.jpg|thumb|right|Scanlan Building, Houston, Texas (postcard, circa 1912–1924)]]
* The Chevron Tower, formerly the Gulf Tower, was built in 1982.

* The [[Enron Center South]], also the Enron II, designed by [[Cesar Pelli]] was completed in 2002. (Note: [[Enron]] went bankrupt before the building's completion and was sold soon after it was completed for about half of its $200&amp;nbsp;million construction cost).
* The [[Hobby Center for the Performing Arts]] was started in 2000 and completed in 2002.
* The Lyric Centre, named for its adjacency to the Theater District.
* The [[Carter Building (Houston)|Carter Building]], once the tallest building in Texas, more recently re-purposed as a hotel.
* The [[Scanlan Building]], at Main and Preston, was built on the site of the first official "White House" of the [[Republic of Texas]].

The '''electronics industry,''' especially meaning [[consumer electronics]], emerged in the 20th century and has now become a global industry worth billions of dollars. Contemporary society uses all manner of electronic devices built in automated or semi-automated factories operated by the industry.  Products are assembled from [[integrated circuit]]s, principally by [[photolithography]] of [[printed circuit board]]s.

The size of the industry and the use of toxic materials, as well as the difficulty of recycling has led to a series of problems with [[electronic waste]]. International regulation and environmental legislation has been developed in an attempt to  address the issues.

== History ==
The [[electric power industry]] began in the 19th century and this led to the development of all manner of inventions.  [[Gramaphones|Gramophones]] were an early invention and this was followed by [[radio]] transmitters and receivers and televisions. The first [[digital computer]]s were built in the 1940s with a slow development in technology and total sales. In the 1970s and 1980s, the [[vacuum tube]], was largely supplanted by [[Semiconductor component|semiconductor components]] as the fundamental technology of the industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/exar-corp-history/|title=International Directory of Company Histories|last=|first=|publisher=St. James Press|year=1996|isbn=|volume=Vol. 14|location=|pages=|via=FundingUniverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s the [[personal computer]] became popular. A large part of the electronics industry is now involved with [[digital technology]].

The industry now employs large numbers of [[electronics engineer]]s and [[electronics technician]]s to design, develop, test, manufacture, install, and repair electrical and electronic equipment such as communication equipment, medical monitoring devices, navigational equipment, and computers. Common parts manufactured are connectors, system components, cell systems, computer accessories, and these are made of alloy steel, copper, brass, stainless steel, plastic, steel tubing and other materials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bracalente.com/markets/ Industries and Markets]", Bracalente Manufacturing Group, Retrieved April 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumer electronics ==
[[Consumer electronics]] are products intended for everyday use, most often in [[entertainment]], [[communication]]s and [[office]] productivity.  [[Radio broadcasting]] in the early 20th century brought the first major consumer product, the broadcast receiver.  Later products include [[personal computer]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[MP3 player]]s, [[audio equipment]], [[television]]s, [[calculator]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[automotive electronics]], [[digital camera]]s and players and recorders using video media such as [[DVD]]s, [[VCR]]s or [[camcorder]]s. Increasingly these products have become based on digital technologies, and have largely merged with the computer industry in what is increasingly referred to as the [[consumerization]] of [[information technology]].

The CEA ([[Consumer Electronics Association]]) estimated the value of 2017 consumer electronics sales at US$319 billion or INR ₹ 21,98,700cr..&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Effects on the environment ==
Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials and up to 60 elements can be found in complex electronics.
The United States and China are the world leaders in producing electronic waste, each tossing away about 3 million tons each year.&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=612&amp;ArticleID=6471|title=Urgent need to prepare developing countries for surges in E-Waste}}&lt;/ref&gt;   China also remains a major e-waste dumping ground for developed countries.&lt;ref name="unep.org"/&gt; The [[UNEP]] estimate that the amount of e-waste being produced - including mobile phones and computers - could rise by as much as 500 percent over the next decade in some  [[developing country|developing countries]], such as India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Section| first = United Nations News Service| title = As e-waste mountains soar, UN urges smart technologies to protect health| work = United Nations-DPI/NMD - UN News Service Section| accessdate = 2012-03-12| date = 2010-02-22| url = https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33845&amp;Cr=waste&amp;Cr1}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further|Electronic waste}}

Increasing environmental awareness has led to changes in electronics design to reduce or eliminate toxic materials and to reduce energy consumption. The [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) and [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE) were released by the [[European Commission]] in 2002.

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

'''Free trade''' is a [[trade policy]] that does not restrict [[imports]] or [[exports]]; it is the idea of the [[free market]] as applied to [[international trade]]. In government, free trade is predominately advocated by political parties that hold [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] or [[Liberalism|liberal]] economic positions, while economically [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political parties generally support [[protectionism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State Aid for Newspapers: Theories, Cases, Actions|last=Murschetz|first=Paul|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2013|isbn=978-3642356902|location=|pages=64|quote=Parties of the left in government in adopt protectionist policies for ideological reasons and because they wish to save worker jobs.

Most nations are today members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) [[multilateralism|multilateral]] trade agreements. Free trade is additionally exemplified by the [[European Economic Area]] and the [[Mercosur]], which have established [[open market]]s. However, most governments still impose some [[protectionist]] policies that are intended to support local employment, such as applying [[tariff]]s to imports or [[Subsidy|subsidies]] to exports. Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources. Other barriers that may hinder trade include [[import quotas]], taxes, and [[non-tariff barrier]]s, such as regulatory [[legislation]].

There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare, while free trade and the reduction of [[trade barrier]]s has a positive effect on economic growth.&lt;ref name="See P 1994"&gt;See P.Krugman, «The Narrow and Broad Arguments for Free Trade», American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings, 83(3), 1993 ; and P.Krugman, Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in the Age of Diminished Expectations, New York, W.W.

==Features==
Free trade policies generally promote the following features:{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}
* Trade of [[good (economics)|goods]] without taxes (including tariffs) or other [[trade barrier]]s (e.g., quotas on imports or subsidies for producers)
* Trade in services without taxes or other trade barriers
* The absence of "trade-distorting" policies (such as taxes, subsidies, [[regulation]]s, or laws) that give some [[business entity|firms]], households, or [[factors of production]] an advantage over others
* Unregulated access to [[Market (economics)|markets]]
* Unregulated access to market information
* Inability of firms to distort markets through government-imposed [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]] power
* [[Trade agreement]]s which encourage free trade.

==Economics==

===Economic models===
{{details|Supply and demand}}
Two simple ways to understand the proposed benefits of free trade are through David Ricardo's theory of [[comparative advantage]] and by analyzing the impact of a tariff or import quota. An economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade.&lt;ref name = "landsburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hartmann"&gt;[[Thom Hartmann]], ''Unequal Protection'', Second Edition, Chapter 20. p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Most economists would recommend that even developing nations should set their tariff rates quite low, but the economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]], a proponent of industrial policy, believes higher levels may be justified in developing nations because the productivity gap between them and developed nations today is much higher than what developed nations faced when they were at a similar level of technological development. Underdeveloped nations today, Chang believes, are weak players in a much more competitive system.&lt;ref name="autogenerated311"&gt;Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', pp. 311–312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|last1 = Chang
|first1 = Ha-Joon
|title = Kicking Away the Ladder: Good Policies and Good Institutions in Historical Perspective
|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTDECINEQ/Resources/KAL-SummaryPaper.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterarguments to Chang's point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad, whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves, and that developing countries can sell to export markets far richer than any that existed in the 19th century.

If the chief justification for a tariff is to stimulate infant industries, it must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete with imported goods in order to be successful. This theory, known as [[import substitution industrialization]], is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated311"/&gt;

====Tariffs====
[[File:EffectOfTariff.svg|thumb|right|upright=2.05|The pink regions are the net loss to society caused by the existence of the tariff.]]
The chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good. Prior to the tariff, the price of the good in the world market (and hence in the domestic market) is P&lt;sub&gt;world&lt;/sub&gt;. The tariff increases the domestic price to P&lt;sub&gt;tariff&lt;/sub&gt;. The higher price causes domestic production to increase from Q&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; to Q&lt;sub&gt;S2&lt;/sub&gt; and causes domestic consumption to decline from Q&lt;sub&gt;C1&lt;/sub&gt; to Q&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="stockman"&gt;Alan C. Stockman, ''Introduction to Economics'', Second Edition, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mankiw"&gt;[[N. Gregory Mankiw]], ''Macroeconomics'', Fifth Edition, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

This has three main effects on societal welfare. Consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus (green region) becomes smaller. Producers are better off because the producer surplus (yellow region) is made larger. The government also has additional tax revenue (blue region). However, the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government. The magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles. Removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society.&lt;ref name="stockman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mankiw" /&gt;

An almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results. From that country's perspective, the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off, but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers (there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff). Under similar analysis, export tariffs, import quotas, and export quotas all yield nearly identical results.&lt;ref name = "landsburg"/&gt;

Sometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off, and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off, but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions. Free trade creates winners and losers, but theory and empirical evidence show that the size of the winnings from free trade are larger than the losses.&lt;ref name = "landsburg"/&gt;

===Trade diversion===
According to [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] theory, the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to [[efficiency (economics)|economic inefficiency]] through the process of [[trade diversion]]. It is economically efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer, but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff. Applying free trade to the high cost producer (and not the low cost producer as well) can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss. This is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions, such as the [[Doha Round]].&lt;ref name="landsburg"&gt;[[Steven E. Landsburg]]. ''Price Theory and Applications'', Sixth Edition, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economist opinions===
The literature analysing the economics of free trade is extremely rich with extensive work having been done on the theoretical and empirical effects. Though it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among economists is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Most economists would agree{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} that although increasing returns to scale might mean that certain industry could settle in a geographical area without any strong economic reason derived from comparative advantage, this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both "winner" and "loser" will increase with the "winner" gaining more than the "loser" but both gaining more than before in an absolute level.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Economists who advocated free trade believed trade was the reason why certain civilizations prospered economically. Adam Smith, for example, pointed to increased trading as being the reason for the flourishing of not just [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] cultures such as [[Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Roman Empire|Rome]], but also of [[Bengal]] ([[Indian subcontinent|East India]]) and [[China]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the free trade/mercantilist dispute the most important question in economics for centuries. Free trade policies have battled with [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]], [[protectionism|protectionist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]], [[communism|communist]], [[populism|populist]], and other policies over the centuries.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] had [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] free trade policies by the 18th century, with origins in [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]], dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulations]] in 1673, in 1740 which lowered [[Duty (economics)|duties]] to only 3% for imports and exports, and in 1790. Ottoman free trade policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade, such as [[J. R. McCulloch]] in his ''Dictionary of Commerce'' (1834), but criticized by British politicians opposing free trade, such as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who cited the Ottoman Empire as "an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition" in the 1846 [[Corn Laws]] debate, arguing that it destroyed what had been "some of the finest manufactures of the world" in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economics and World History: Myths and Paradoxes|author=[[Paul Bairoch]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1995|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/193124153/Economics-and-World-History-Myths-and-Paradoxes-Paul-Bairoch|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Droits de douane (France, UK, US).png|thumb|Average Tariff Rates (France, UK, US)]]
Trade in [[British America|colonial America]] was regulated by the British mercantile system through the [[Acts of Trade and Navigation]]. Until the 1760s, few colonists openly advocated for free trade, in part because regulations were not strictly enforced – New England was famous for smuggling – but also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the [[American Revolution]]. "The idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong," wrote Dickerson, "was not a part of the thinking of the Revolutionary leaders".&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, ''The Navigation Acts and the American Revolution'', p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free trade came to what would become the United States as a result of [[American Revolutionary War]]. After the British Parliament issued the [[Prohibitory Act]], blockading colonial ports, the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] responded by effectively declaring economic independence, opening American ports to foreign trade on April 6, 1776. According to historian John W. Tyler, "Free trade had been forced on the Americans, like it or not."&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, ''Smugglers &amp; Patriots'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1801 the Pope [[Pius VII]] ordered some liberalization of trade to face the economic crisis in the [[Papal States]] with the [[Motu Proprio]] "Le più colte"; despite this, the export of national corn was forbidden to ensure the food for the State.

[[File:British ships in Canton.jpg|thumb|Britain waged two [[Opium Wars]] to force China to legalize the [[opium trade]] and to open all of China to British merchants.]]
In Britain, free trade became a central principle [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#Free trade|practiced by the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846]].   Large-scale agitation was sponsored by the [[Anti-Corn Law League]].  Under the [[Treaty of Nanking]], China opened five [[treaty ports]] to world trade in 1843. The first free trade agreement, the [[Cobden-Chevalier Treaty]], was put in place in 1860 between Britain and France, which led to successive agreements between other countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=International Monetary Fund Research Dept.|title=World Economic Outlook, May 1997: Globalization: Opportunities and Challenges|date=1997|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=9781455278886|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JCOzhl3848MC&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many classical liberals, especially in 19th and early 20th century Britain (e.g. [[John Stuart Mill]]) and in the United States for much of the 20th century (e.g., [[Henry Ford]] and Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]]), believed that free trade promoted peace.  [[Woodrow Wilson]] included free-trade rhetoric in his "[[Fourteen Points]]" speech of 1918:

{{quote|The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, all we see it, is this: [...]

3. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourteen Points Speech|Fourteen Points]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to economic historian Douglas Irwin, a common myth about U.S. trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early 19th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21731616-douglas-irwin-agrees-trade-policy-important-all-manner-powers-are-wrongly|title=A historian on the myths of American trade|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review by the ''Economist'' of Irwin's 2017 book ''Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy'' notes:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Paul Bairoch]], since the end of the 18th century, the United States has been "the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism". In fact, the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945. For the most part, the "Jeffersonians" strongly opposed it. In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator [[Henry Clay]] continued Hamilton's themes within the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] under the name "[[American System (economic plan)|American System]]." The opposition [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] contested several elections throughout the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s in part over the issue of the tariff and protection of industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Schweikart]], ''What Would the Founders Say?'' (New York: Sentinel, 2011), pp. 106–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the Democratic Party favored moderate tariffs used for government revenue only, while the Whigs favored higher protective tariffs to protect favored industries. The economist [[Henry Charles Carey]] became a leading proponent of the "American System" of economics. This mercantilist "American System" was opposed by the Democratic Party of [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]], [[John Tyler]], [[James K. Polk]], [[Franklin Pierce]], and [[James Buchanan]].

The fledgling [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], who called himself a "Henry Clay tariff Whig", strongly opposed free trade and implemented a 44% tariff during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] – in part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort, and to protect favored industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind|first=Matthew|title=Free Trade Fallacy|url=http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=1080 |publisher=Prospect|accessdate=3 January 2011 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060106154801/http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&amp;DocID=1080 |archivedate = 6 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William McKinley]] (later to become President of the United States) stated the stance of the Republican Party (which won every election for President from 1868 until 1912, except the two non-consecutive terms of [[Grover Cleveland]]) as thus:

{{quote|Under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man. [It is said] that protection is immoral…. Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [the U.S. population] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates the rest of the world. We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefitting mankind everywhere. Well, they say, 'Buy where you can buy the cheapest'…. Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: 'Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards.&lt;ref&gt;William McKinley speech, October 4, 1892 in Boston, MA William McKinley Papers (Library of Congress)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the interwar period, economic [[protectionism]] took hold in the United States, most famously in the form of the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]], which is credited by economists with the prolonging and worldwide propagation of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 6th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2011 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-bannons-bad-history-1505861920|title=Steve Bannon’s Bad History|last=Irwin|first=Douglas A.|date=2017-09-19|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1934, trade liberalization began to take place through the [[Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act]].

In ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', development economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] reviews the history of free trade policies and economic growth, and notes that many of the now-industrialized countries had significant barriers to trade throughout their history. The United States and Britain, sometimes considered the homes of free trade policy, employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times. Britain abolished the [[Corn Laws]], which restricted import of grain, in 1846 in response to domestic pressures, and it reduced protectionism for manufactures in the mid 19th century, when its technological advantage was at its height, but tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950. The United States maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately 40–50% up until the 1950s, augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The most consistent practitioners of free trade have been Switzerland, the Netherlands, and to a lesser degree Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Chang describes the [[export-oriented industrialization]] policies of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] as "far more sophisticated and fine-tuned than their historical equivalents".&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Some degree of protectionism is nevertheless the norm throughout the world. Most developed nations maintain controversial{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} agricultural tariffs. From 1820 to 1980, the average tariffs on manufactures in twelve industrial countries ranged from 11 to 32%. In the developing world, average tariffs on manufactured goods are approximately 34%.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2003), ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The American economist [[C. Fred Bergsten]] devised the ‘bicycle theory’ to describe [[trade policy]]. According to this model trade policy is ‘dynamically unstable’, in that it constantly tends towards either liberalisation or protectionism. To prevent falling off the bike (the disadvantages of protectionism), trade policy and [[multilateral trade negotiations]] must constantly pedal towards greater liberalisation. To achieve greater liberalisation decision makers must appeal to the greater welfare for consumers and the wider national economy over narrower parochial interests. However, Bergsten also posits that it is also necessary to compensate the losers in trade and help them find new work, as this will both reduce the backlash against globalisation and the motives for trades unions and politicians to call for protection of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Destler, Mac and Noland, Marcus (July 2, 2014).

===Post-World War II===
Since the end of [[World War II]], in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War, the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff-barriers and free trade. The U.S. helped establish the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and later the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); although it had rejected an earlier version in the 1950s ([[International Trade Organization]] or ITO).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/pera9707.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Since the 1970s, U.S. governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in the 1990s, the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) in 2006, and a number of bilateral agreements (such as with Jordan).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In Europe, [[Inner Six|six countries]] formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) in 1951 which became the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the [[single market]], and establishing a [[customs union]] between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993.

==Politics==
The relative [[social cost|costs]], benefits and beneficiaries of free trade are debated by academics, governments and interest groups.

Arguments for protectionism fall into the economic category (trade hurts the economy or groups in the economy) or the moral category (the effects of trade might help the economy, but have ill effects in other areas); a general argument against free trade is that it is [[colonialism]] or [[imperialism]] in disguise. The moral category is wide, including concerns of destroying infant industries and undermining long-run economic development, [[income inequality]], [[environmental degradation]], supporting [[child labor]] and [[sweatshops]], [[race to the bottom]], [[wage slavery]], accentuating poverty in poor countries, harming [[Defense (military)|national defense]], and forcing [[cultural change]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald J. Boudreaux|Boudreaux, Don]] ''Globalization'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2017}}

Economic arguments against free trade criticize the assumptions or conclusions of economic theories. Sociopolitical arguments against free trade cite social and political effects that economic arguments do not capture, such as political stability, national security, human rights and environmental protection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Free trade is often opposed by domestic industries that would have their profits and market share reduced by lower prices for imported goods.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Baumol]] and [[Alan Blinder]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=NNRU3b_tE7cC&amp;pg=PA761#PPA722,M1 Economics: Principles and Policy], p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='brakman'&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brakman | first = Steven | authorlink = |author2=Harry Garretsen |author3=Charles Van Marrewijk |author4=Arjen Van Witteloostuijn  | title = Nations and Firms in the Global Economy : An Introduction to International Economics and Business | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | location = Cambridge | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-521-83298-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if United States tariffs on imported sugar were reduced, U.S. sugar producers would receive lower prices and profits, while U.S. sugar consumers would spend less for the same amount of sugar because of those same lower prices. The economic theory of [[David Ricardo]] holds that consumers would necessarily gain more than producers would lose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard L. Stroup]], James D. Gwartney, Russell S. Sobel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1cklAwAVAgkC&amp;pg=PA45#PPA46,M1 Economics: Private and Public Choice], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='pugel'&gt;{{Cite book| last = Pugel | first = Thomas A. | authorlink = | title = International economics | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2003 | location = Boston | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-07-119875-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since each of those few domestic sugar producers would lose a lot while each of a great number of consumers would gain only a little, domestic producers are more likely to mobilize against the lifting of tariffs.&lt;ref name='brakman'/&gt; More generally, producers often favor domestic subsidies and tariffs on imports in their home countries, while objecting to subsidies and tariffs in their export markets.

Socialists frequently oppose free trade on the ground that it allows maximum [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of [[Labor movement|workers]] by [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. For example, [[Karl Marx]] wrote in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', "The bourgeoisie... has set up that single, unconscionable freedom – free trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation." Nonetheless, Marx did favor free trade – ''solely'' because he felt that it would hasten the social revolution.&lt;ref&gt;"It is in this revolutionary sense ''alone'', gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade." Marx, Karl [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/01/09ft.htm#marx On the Question of Free Trade] Speech to the Democratic Association of Brussels at its public meeting of January 9, 1848&lt;/ref&gt;

"Free trade" is opposed by many anti-globalization groups, based on their assertion that free trade agreements generally do not increase the [[economic freedom]] of the poor or the working class, and frequently make them poorer. Where the foreign supplier allows de facto exploitation of labor, domestic free-labor is unfairly forced to compete with the foreign exploited labor. To this extent, free trade is seen as an end-run around workers' rights and laws that protect individual liberty.

Some opponents of free trade favor free trade theory but oppose free trade ''agreements'' as applied. Some opponents of NAFTA see the agreement as being materially harmful to the common people, but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of government-managed trade, rather than against free trade ''per se''. For example, it is argued that it would be wrong to let subsidized corn from the U.S. into Mexico freely under NAFTA at prices well below production cost ([[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]) because of its ruinous effects to Mexican farmers. Of course, such subsidies violate free trade theory, so this argument is not actually against the principle of free trade, but rather its selective implementation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

It has long been argued that free trade is a form of colonialism or imperialism, a position taken by various proponents of [[economic nationalism]] and the school of mercantilism. In the 19th century these criticized British calls for free trade as cover for [[British Empire]], notably in the works of American [[Henry Clay]], architect of the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]]&lt;ref&gt;"Gentlemen deceive themselves. It is not free trade that they are recommending to our acceptance. It is, in effect, the British colonial system that we are invited to adopt; and, if their policy prevail, it will lead, substantially, to the recolonization of these States, under the commercial dominion of Great Britain.", "In Defense of the American System, Against the British Colonial System." 1832, Feb 2, 3, and 6, {{Cite journal| title = The Life and Speeches of Henry Clay | volume = II | first = Henry | last = Clay | year = 1843 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Biyh3OmxhOMC&amp;pg=PA23 |pages= 23–24 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[German American]] economist [[Friedrich List]].&lt;ref&gt;"Had the English left everything to itself – '[[Laissez faire]], laissez aller', as the popular economical school recommends – the [German] merchants of the [[Steelyard]] would be still carrying on their trade in London, the Belgians would be still manufacturing cloth for the English, England would have still continued to be the sheep-farm of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansards]], just as Portugal became the vineyard of England, and has remained so till our days, owing to the stratagem of a cunning diplomatist."&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Ecuadorian President [[Rafael Correa]] has denounced the "sophistry of free trade" in an introduction he wrote for a book titled ''The Hidden Face of Free Trade Accords'', written in part by Correa's current Energy Minister Alberto Acosta. Citing as his source the book [http://www.paecon.net/PAEtexts/Chang1.htm ''Kicking Away the Ladder''], written by [[Ha-Joon Chang]], Correa identified the difference between an "American system" opposed to a "British System" of free trade. The latter, he says, was explicitly viewed by the Americans as "part of the British imperialist system." According to Correa, Chang showed that it was Treasury Secretary [[Alexander Hamilton]], and not [[Friedrich List]], who was the first to present a systematic argument defending industrial protectionism.

==Alternatives==
The following alternatives for free trade have been proposed: [[balanced trade]], [[fair trade]], [[protectionism]], [[industrial policy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==In literature==
The value of free trade was first observed and documented by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwati (2002), ''Free Trade Today'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote,
{{quote|It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy.... If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'', pp. 264–265&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This statement uses the concept of [[absolute advantage]] to present an argument in opposition to [[mercantilism]], the dominant view surrounding trade at the time, which held that a country should aim to export more than it imports, and thus amass wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Smith argues, countries could gain from each producing exclusively the good(s) in which they are most suited to, trading between each other as required for the purposes of consumption. In this vein, it is not the value of exports relative to that of imports that is important, but the value of the goods produced by a nation. The concept of absolute advantage however does not address a situation where a country has no advantage in the production of a particular good or type of good.&lt;ref&gt;Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

This theoretical shortcoming was addressed by the theory of comparative advantage. Generally attributed to [[David Ricardo]] who expanded on it in his 1817 book ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo (1817), ''On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'', Chapter 7 "On Foreign Trade"&lt;/ref&gt; it makes a case for free trade based not on absolute advantage in production of a good, but on the relative [[opportunity cost]]s of production. A country should specialize in whatever good it can produce at the lowest cost, trading this good to buy other goods it requires for consumption. This allows for countries to benefit from trade even when they do not have an absolute advantage in any area of production. While their gains from trade might not be equal to those of a country more productive in all goods, they will still be better off economically from trade than they would be under a state of [[autarky]].
&lt;ref&gt;Bhagwati (2002), ''Free Trade Today'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugel (2007), ''International Economics'', pp. 35–38, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptionally, [[Henry George]]'s 1886 book ''[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' was read out loud in full into the [[Congressional Record]] by five Democratic congressmen.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, "A Fragile Alliance," 425–425&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7qlMAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=protection%20or%20free%20trade ''Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor](New York: 1887).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tyler Cowen]] wrote that '[[Protection or Free Trade]]'' "remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cowen|first1=Tyler|title=Anti-Capitalist Rerun|journal=The American Interest|date=May 1, 2009|volume= 4|issue= 5|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2009/05/01/anti-capitalist-rerun/|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
George discusses the subject in particular with respect to the interests of labor. Although George is very critical towards protectionism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We all hear with interest and pleasure of improvements in transportation by water or land; we are all disposed to regard the opening of canals, the building of railways, the deepening of harbors, the improvement of steamships as beneficial. But if such things are beneficial, how can tariffs be beneficial? The effect of such things is to lessen the cost of transporting commodities; the effect of tariffs is to increase it. If the protective theory be true, every improvement that cheapens the carriage of goods between country and country is an injury to mankind unless tariffs be commensurately increased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truefreetrade.org/pft3.htm "True Free Trade", Chapter 3, ''Protection or Free Trade'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; George considers the general free trade argument 'inadequate'. He argues that the removal of protective tariffs alone is never sufficient to improve the situation of the working class, unless accompanied by a shift towards [[land value tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truefreetrade.org/pft16.htm|title=Protection or Free Trade - Chapter 16|website=www.truefreetrade.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4710">'''GASB 45''', or GASB Statement 45, is an [[accounting]] and [[Financial statements|financial reporting]] provision requiring [[government]] employers to measure and report the [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] associated with other (than pension) postemployment benefits (or [[OPEB]]). Reported OPEBs may include post-retirement medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, life, long-term disability and long-term care benefits that are not associated with a pension plan. Government employers required to comply with GASB 45 include all states, towns, education boards, water districts, mosquito districts, public schools and all other government entities that offer OPEB and report under GASB.

GASB 45 was instigated by the [[Governmental Accounting Standards Board]] (GASB) in July 2004 because of the growing concern over the potential magnitude of government employer obligations for post-employment benefits. GASB 45 will:

#Recognize the cost of OPEB benefits in the period when services are received.
#Provide information about the actuarial liabilities for the promised benefits.
#Provide information useful in assessing potential demands on future [[cash flows]].

GASB 45 applies to the [[financial statements]] issued by government employers that offer OPEB and that are subject to GASB accounting standards. GASB 45 does not apply to private employers or trusts that are established in order to pre-fund OPEB benefits and for trusts that are used as conduits to pay OPEB benefits.

==GASB 45 requirements==
GASB 45 requires the following disclosures on financial statements:
#Information about the OPEBs: what are the benefits, who is eligible for the benefits, how many employees and retirees are covered, and so forth.
#The actuarially determined liability for OPEB benefits and the assets (if any) that are available to offset the liability; also information about the actuarial methods and assumptions that were used to calculate the liability.
#The portion of the liability that must be reported as an annual accounting expense on the employer’s financial statements, and a cumulative accounting of the extent to which the plan sponsor actually makes contributions to offset its annual expense.

==Implementation==
GASB has implemented the reporting of OPEB in three phases. The phase that applies to a plan sponsor for GASB 43 and GASB 45 implementation is identical to the phase that applied to that plan sponsor for GASB 34 implementation and is based on annual revenue reported in the first fiscal year ending after June 15, 1999.
The implementation schedule for GASB 45 is:
#Phase 1 implementation—for employers with annual revenues greater than $100 million—is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.
#Phase 2 implementation—for employers with annual revenues between $10 million and $100 million—is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007.
#Phase 3 implementation—for employers with annual revenues less than $10 million—is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008.

Smaller governments can use the Alternative Measurement Method (AMM) to comply with GASB 45 reporting requirements.  The AMM was designed to provide a lower cost option for organizations with fewer than 100 plan members.  Several online resources are available from credible consulting firms (e.g., Gabriel Roeder Smith, Milliman).

==OPEB liability calculations==
Typically an [[actuary]] (or actuaries) with both [[pension]] and [[Health insurance in the United States|health experience]] must perform the calculations following generally accepted actuarial methods.  For small plans covering fewer than 100 plan members, the plan sponsor can elect to use the alternative measurement method, a streamlined method to calculate the OPEB liability. This approach is typically less expensive and was developed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.

==Unfunded liability==
There are three basic ways of treating unfunded liabilities:
* establish and fund an irrevocable trust
* pay-as-you-go
* setting aside a dedicated reserve

'''George Knipp &amp; Brother Building''' is a historic [[retail]] building located at [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. It is a five-story brick commercial structure with a four-bay [[cast iron architecture|cast-iron façade]], constructed about 1875. It features large window openings flanked by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns.  It was originally the location of John Knipps’ furniture business and his brother George Knipp's enterprise in gas fixtures and plumbing supplies. It was later occupied by a furniture and carpet firm and later a [[McCrory Stores|J.G. McCrory Co. store]].&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-1137.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: 409 West Baltimore Street|date=May 1990|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Peter E.

The '''ISO 9000''' family of [[quality management system]]s standards is designed to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/09544780210439734 |title=The state of ISO 9000 certification: A study of Swedish organizations |year=2002 |last1=Poksinska |first1=Bozena |last2=Dahlgaard |first2=Jens Jörn |last3=Antoni |first3=Marc |journal=The TQM Magazine |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ISO]] 9000 deals with the fundamentals of quality management systems,&lt;ref name="Tsim, Yeung, Leung 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02686900210429669 |title=An adaptation to ISO 9001:2000 for certified organisations |year=2002 |last1=Tsim |first1=Y.C. |last2=Yeung |first2=V.W.S. |last3=Leung |first3=Edgar T.C. |journal=Managerial Auditing Journal |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the seven quality management principles upon which the family of standards is based.&lt;ref name="Tsim, Yeung, Leung 2002" /&gt;

Third-party certification bodies provide independent confirmation that organizations meet the requirements of ISO 9001.

==Background==
ISO 9000 was first published in 1987 by ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsieducation.org/Education/about/brief-history.shtml|title=BSOL Academic - BSI Group|website=Bsieducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the BS 5750 series of standards from [[BSI Group|BSI]] that were proposed to ISO in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/News-Room/BSI-Fast-Facts2/|title=Standards, Training, Testing, Assessment and Certification - BSI Group|website=Bsigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its history can be traced back some twenty years before that, to the publication of government procurement standards, such as the [[United States Department of Defense]] MIL-Q-9858 standard in 1959, and the U.K's Def Stan 05-21 and 05-24. Large organizations which supplied government procurement agencies often had to comply with a variety of quality assurance requirements for each contract awarded which led the defence industry to adopt mutual recognition of NATO AQAP, MIL-Q and Def Stan standards. Eventually, ISO 9000 was adopted as a suitable option, instead of forcing contractors to adopt multiple - and often similar - requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stamatis|first1=D H|title=Understanding ISO 9000 and Implementing the Basics to Quality|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1YGfv04PdS0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Def+Stan+05-21+and+05-24&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oHo-BVa1Yk&amp;sig=daVSwh3-ma79IGwMe8Pne4qSZ14&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCsuTK76LZAhUiDMAKHRQ7Bw8Q6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Def%20Stan%2005-21%20and%2005-24&amp;f=false|publisher=CRC Press|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for use==
The global adoption of ISO 9001 may be attributable to a number of factors. In the early days, the ISO 9001 (9002 and 9003) requirements were intended to be used by procuring organizations, as the basis of contractual arrangements with their suppliers. This helped reduce the need for "supplier development" by establishing basic requirements for a supplier to assure product quality. The ISO 9001 requirements could be tailored to meet specific contractual situations, depending on the complexity of product, business type (design responsibility, manufacture only, distribution, servicing etc.) and risk to the procurer. If a chosen supplier was weak on the controls of their measurement equipment (calibration), and hence QC/inspection results, that specific requirement would be invoked in the contract. The adoption of a single Quality Assurance requirement also lead to cost savings throughout the supply chain by reducing the administrative burden of  maintaining multiple sets of quality manuals and procedures.

A few years later, the U.K. Government took steps to improve national competitiveness following publication of cmd 8621, and Third Party Certification of Quality Management Systems was born, under the auspices of the National Accreditation Council of Certification Bodies (NACCB) which has become the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) .

In addition to several stakeholders' benefits, a number of studies have identified significant financial benefits for organizations certified to ISO 9001, with a 2011 survey from the British Assessment Bureau showing 44% of their certified clients had won new business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-assessment.co.uk/news/iso-9001-proven-to-help-win-new-business |title=ISO 9001 proven to help win new business |date=25 May 2011 |publisher=British Assessment Bureau |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728164740/http://www.british-assessment.co.uk/news/iso-9001-proven-to-help-win-new-business |archivedate=28 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbett ''et al.'' showed that certified organizations achieved superior [[return on assets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsi-emea.com/Quality/CaseStudies/Interstate.pdf |title=BSI Case Study on the Benefits of ISO 9000 Registration - Interstate Worldwide Relocation |publisher=BSi Management System |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519003025/http://www.bsi-emea.com/Quality/CaseStudies/Interstate.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to otherwise similar organizations without certification.&lt;ref name="Corbett, Montes-Sancho, Kirsch 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20110397 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.1040.0358 |title=The Financial Impact of ISO 9000 Certification in the United States: An Empirical Analysis |year=2005 |last1=Corbett |first1=Charles J. |last2=Montes-Sancho |first2=María J. |last3=Kirsch |first3=David A. |journal=Management Science |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=1607–16 |url=http://neumann.hec.ca/cref/sem/documents/040923.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109164222/http://neumann.hec.ca/cref/sem/documents/040923.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heras ''et al.''  found similarly superior performance&lt;ref name="Corbett, Montes-Sancho, Kirsch 2005" /&gt; and demonstrated that this was statistically significant and not a function of organization size.&lt;ref name="eps.udg.es"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02656710210429618 |title=ISO 9000 registration's impact on sales and profitability: A longitudinal analysis of performance before and after accreditation |year=2002 |last1=Heras |first1=Iñaki |last2=Dick |first2=Gavin P.M. |last3=Casadesús |first3=Martí |journal=International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=774|url=http://kar.kent.ac.uk/5118/1/IJQRM%282002%29vol19n6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naveha and Marcus claimed that implementing ISO 9001 led to superior operational performance in the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. automotive industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aap.2006.11.004 |title=Financial performance, ISO 9000 standard and safe driving practices effects on accident rate in the U.S. Motor carrier industry |year=2007 |last1=Naveh |first1=Eitan |last2=Marcus |first2=Alfred |journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharma identified similar improvements in operating performance and linked this to superior financial performance.&lt;ref name="Sharma2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intacc.2005.01.011 |title=The association between ISO 9000 certification and financial performance |year=2005 |last1=Sharma |first1=Divesh S. |journal=The International Journal of Accounting |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chow-Chua ''et al.'' showed better overall financial performance was achieved for companies in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02656710310493643 |title=Does ISO 9000 certification improve business performance? |year=2003 |last1=Chow-Chua |first1=Clare |last2=Goh |first2=Mark |last3=Wan |first3=Tan Boon |journal=International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajan and Tamimi (2003) showed that ISO 9001 certification resulted in superior stock market performance and suggested that shareholders were richly rewarded for the investment in an ISO 9001 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3905/joi.2003.319536 |title=Payoff to ISO 9000 Registration |year=2003 |last1=Rajan |first1=Murli |last2=Tamimi |first2=Nabil |journal=The Journal of Investing |volume=12 |pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the connection between superior financial performance and ISO 9001 may be seen from the examples cited, there remains no proof of direct causation, though [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], such as those of Corbett ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;ref name="Corbett, Montes-Sancho, Kirsch 2005"/&gt; may suggest it. Other writers, such as Heras ''et al.'' (2002),&lt;ref name="eps.udg.es"/&gt; have suggested that while there is some evidence of this, the improvement is partly driven by the fact that there is a tendency for better performing companies to seek ISO 9001 certification.

The mechanism for improving results has also been the subject of much research. Lo ''et al.'' (2007) identified operational improvements (e.g., cycle time reduction, inventory reductions) as following from certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/joi.00207540600733709 |title=The difference in the perceived benefits between firms that maintain ISO certification and those that do not |year=2007 |last1=Lo |first1=Liang Kang |last2=Chang |first2=Dong Shang |journal=International Journal of Production Research |volume=45 |pages=1881–1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal process improvements in organizations lead to externally observable improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02656719710186867 |title=ISO 9000: Marketing motivations and benefits |year=1997 |last1=Buttle |first1=Francis |journal=International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=936–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02656710210415703 |title=Benefits of the ISO  9000:1994 system: Some considerations to reinforce competitive advantage |year=2002 |last1=Santos |first1=Leticia |last2=Escanciano |first2=Carmen |journal=International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=321–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of increased international trade and domestic market share, in addition to the internal benefits such as customer satisfaction, interdepartmental communications, work processes, and customer/supplier partnerships derived, far exceeds any and all initial investment.&lt;ref name="Alcorn1995"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/9780470314661.ch3 |title=The Benefits of ISO 9000 Certification |journal=A Collection of Papers Presented at the 55th Conference on Glass Problems: Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings |volume=16 |issue=2 |series=Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings |year=2008 |last1=Alcorn |first1=Janice E. |isbn=978-0-470-31466-1 |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO 9000 series Quality Management Principles==

The ISO 9000 series are based on seven quality management principles (QMP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO quality management principles|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Iso.org|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven quality management principles are:
*QMP 1 – Customer focus
*QMP 2 – Leadership
*QMP 3 – Engagement of people
*QMP 4 – Process approach
*QMP 5 – Improvement
*QMP 6 – Evidence-based decision making
*QMP 7 – Relationship management

Principle 1 – Customer focus
: Organizations depend on their customers and therefore should understand current and future customer needs, should meet customer requirements and strive to exceed customer expectations.

Principle 2 – Leadership
: Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization. They should create and maintain the internal environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives.

Principle 3 – Engagement of people
:People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used for the organization's benefit.

Principle 4 – Process approach
:A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related resources are managed as a process.

Principle 5 – Improvement
:Improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization.

Principle 6 – Evidence-based decision making
:Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.

Principle 7 – Relationship management
:An organization and its external providers (suppliers, contractors, service providers) are interdependent and a mutually beneficial relationship enhances the ability of both to create value.

'''''ISO 9001:2015 Quality management systems — Requirements''''' is a document of approximately 30 pages which is available from the national standards organization in each country.  Only ISO 9001 is directly audited against for third party assessment purposes.

Contents of ISO 9001:2015 are as follows:

* Section 1: Scope
* Section 2: Normative references
* Section 3: Terms and definitions
* Section 4: Context of the organization
* Section 5: Leadership
* Section 6: Planning
* Section 7: Support
* Section 8: Operation
* Section 9: Performance evaluation
* Section 10: Continual Improvement

Essentially the layout of the standard is similar to the previous ISO 9001:2008 standard in that it follows the [[PDCA|Plan, Do, Check, Act]] cycle in a process-based approach, but is now further encouraging this to have risk-based thinking. (section 0.3.3 of the introduction) The purpose of the quality objectives is to determine the conformity of the requirements (customers and organizations), facilitate effective deployment and improve the quality management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qualitydigest.com/magazine/2000/nov/article/using-quality-objectives-drive-strategic-performance-improvement.html|title=Using Quality Objectives to Drive Strategic Performance Improvement|website=Qualitydigest.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isopocketguides.com/media/docs/ISO2KMAN.doc|format=DOC|title=OBJECTIVE OF THE SAMPLE MANUAL|website=Isopocketguides.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the certification body can issue or renew a certificate, the auditor must be satisfied that the company being assessed has implemented the requirements of sections 4 to 10.  Sections 1 to 3 are not directly audited against, but because they provide context and definitions for the rest of the standard, not that of the organization, their contents must be taken into account.

The standard no longer specifies that the organization shall issue and maintain documented procedures, however, ISO 9001:2015 requires the organization to document any other procedures required for its effective operation.  The standard also requires the organization to issue and communicate a documented [[quality policy]], a quality management system scope, and quality objectives. The standard no longer requires compliant organizations to issue a formal Quality Manual. The standard does require retention of numerous records, as specified throughout the standard. New for the 2015 release is a requirement for an organization to assess risks and opportunities (section 6.1) and to determine internal and external issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction (section 4.1). The organization must demonstrate how the standard’s requirements are being met, while the external auditor’s role is to determine the quality management system's effectiveness. More detailed interpretation and implementation examples are often sought by organizations seeking more information in what can be a very technical area.

==Certification==
[[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]] does not certify organizations itself. Numerous certification bodies exist, which audit organizations and, upon success, issue ISO 9001 compliance certificates. Although commonly referred to as "ISO 9000" certification, the actual standard to which an organization's quality management system can be certified is ISO 9001:2015 (ISO 9001:2008 will expire by around September 2018). Many countries have formed [[accreditation]] bodies to authorize ("accredit") the certification bodies. Both the accreditation bodies and the certification bodies charge fees for their services. The various accreditation bodies have mutual agreements with each other to ensure that certificates issued by one of the [[accredited registrar|accredited certification bodies]] (CB) are accepted worldwide. Certification bodies themselves operate under another quality standard, ISO/IEC 17021,&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 17021: "Conformity assessment. Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems" (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; while accreditation bodies operate under ISO/IEC 17011.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 17011: "Conformity assessment. General requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies" (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization applying for ISO 9001 certification is audited based on an extensive sample of its sites, functions, products, services and processes. The auditor presents a list of problems (defined as "nonconformities", "observations", or "opportunities for improvement") to management. If there are no major nonconformities, the certification body will issue a certificate.  Where major nonconformities are identified, the organization will present an improvement plan to the certification body (e.g., corrective action reports showing how the problems will be resolved); once the certification body is satisfied that the organization has carried out sufficient corrective action, it will issue a certificate.  The certificate is limited by a certain scope (e.g., production of golf balls) and will display the addresses to which the certificate refers.

An ISO 9001 certificate is not a once-and-for-all award but must be renewed at regular intervals recommended by the certification body, usually once every three years. There are no grades of competence within ISO 9001: either a company is certified (meaning that it is committed to the method and model of quality management described in the standard) or it is not. In this respect, ISO 9001 certification contrasts with measurement-based quality systems.

==Evolution of ISO 9000 standards==
The ISO 9000 standard is continually being revised by standing technical committees and advisory groups, who receive feedback from those professionals who are implementing the standard.

===1987 version===
ISO 9000:1987 had the same structure as the UK Standard BS 5750, with three "models" for quality management systems, the selection of which was based on the scope of activities of the organization:
*ISO 9001:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in design, development, production, installation, and servicing'' was for companies and organizations whose activities included the creation of new products.
*ISO 9002:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in production, installation, and servicing'' had basically the same material as ISO 9001 but without covering the creation of new products.
*ISO 9003:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in final inspection and test'' covered only the final inspection of finished product, with no concern for how the product was produced.
''ISO 9000:1987'' was also influenced by existing U.S. and other [[Defense Standard]]s ("MIL SPECS"), and so was well-suited to manufacturing. The emphasis tended to be placed on conformance with procedures rather than the overall process of management, which was likely the actual intent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===1994 version===
''ISO 9000:1994'' emphasized [[quality assurance]] via preventive actions, instead of just checking final product, and continued to require evidence of compliance with documented procedures. As with the first edition, the down-side was that companies tended to implement its requirements by creating shelf-loads of procedure manuals, and becoming burdened with an ISO bureaucracy. In some companies, adapting and improving processes could actually be impeded by the quality system.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===2000 version===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:apcer.png|250px|thumb|right|The Portuguese [[ISO 9001]] certification image]] --&gt;
''ISO 9001:2000'' replaced all three former standards of 1994 issue, ''ISO 9001'', ''ISO 9002'' and ''ISO 9003''. Design and development procedures were required only if a company does, in fact, engage in the creation of new products. The 2000 version sought to make a radical change in thinking by actually placing front and centre the concept of [[process management]] (the monitoring and optimisation of a company's tasks and activities, instead of just inspection of the final product). The 2000 version also demanded involvement by upper executives in order to integrate quality into the business system and avoid delegation of quality functions to junior administrators. Another goal was to improve effectiveness via process performance metrics: numerical measurement of the effectiveness of tasks and activities. Expectations of continual process improvement and tracking customer satisfaction were made explicit.

ISO 9000 Requirements include:
* Approve documents before distribution;
* Provide correct version of documents at points of use;
* Use your records to prove that requirements have been met; and
* Develop a procedure to control your records.

===2008 version===
ISO 9001:2008 in essence re-narrates ISO 9001:2000. The 2008 version only introduced clarifications to the existing requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and some changes intended to improve consistency with [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001:2004]]. There were no new requirements. For example, in ISO 9001:2008, a quality management system being upgraded just needs to be checked to see if it is following the clarifications introduced in the amended version.

ISO 9001 is supplemented directly by two other standards of the family:

* ISO 9000:2005 "Quality management systems. Fundamentals and vocabulary"
* ISO 9004:2009 "Managing for the sustained success of an organization. A quality management approach"
Other standards, like [[ISO 19011]] and the ISO 10000 series, may also be used for specific parts of the quality system.

===2015 version===
In 2012, ISO TC 176 - responsible for ISO 9001 development - celebrated 25 years of implementing ISO 9001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asq.org/blog/2012/03/25-years-of-iso-9000/|title=25 Years of ISO 9000 {{!}} A View from the Q|publisher=ASQ|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that it was necessary to create a new QMS model for the next 25 years. They subsequently commenced the official work on creating a revision of ISO 9001, starting with the new QM principles. This moment was considered by important specialists in the field as "beginning of a new era in the development of quality management systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.asigurareacalitatii.ro/wp-content/uploads/83-02.pdf|title = The Standard ISO 9001:2015 - A Milestone in the Evolution of Quality Management|last = Bacivarov|first = Ioan|date = 1 October 2015|journal = Asigurarea Calitatii - Quality Assurance|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the intensive work from this technical committee, the revised standard ISO 9001:2015 was published by ISO on 23 September 2015. The scope of the standard has not changed; however, the structure and core terms were modified to allow the standard to integrate more easily with other international management systems standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Infographic: ISO 9001:2015 vs. 2008 revision – What has changed? |url=https://maritimecyprus.com/2016/08/11/infographic-iso-90012015-vs-2008-revision-what-has-changed/ |publisher=Maritime Cyprus |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 version is also less prescriptive than its predecessors and focuses on performance. This was achieved by combining the process approach with risk-based thinking, and employing the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle at all levels in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/news_index/news_archive/news.htm?refid=Ref2002|title=ISO 9001:2015 - Just published!|publisher=ISO |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key changes include:

*High-Level Structure of 10 clauses is implemented. Now all new standards released by ISO will have this high-level structure
*Greater emphasis on building a management system suited to each organization's particular needs
*A requirement that those at the top of an organization be involved and accountable, aligning quality with wider business strategy 
*Risk-based thinking throughout the standard makes the whole management system a preventive tool and encourages continuous improvement 
*Less prescriptive requirements for documentation: the organization can now decide what documented information it needs and what format it should be in 
*Alignment with other key management system standards through the use of a common structure and core text&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2015/august/BSI-obtains-first-global-accreditation-for-the-new-Quality-Management-standard-ISO-90012015-from-ANAB/#.Vem-kxFVhBc|title=BSI obtains first global accreditation from ANAB to certify organizations to the new Quality Management standard ISO 9001:2015|publisher=BSI |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Inclusion of Knowledge Management principles
*Quality Manual &amp; Management representative (MR) are no longer mandatory

==Auditing==

Two types of auditing are required to become registered to the standard: auditing by an external certification body (external audit) and audits by internal staff trained for this process (internal audits). The aim is a continual process of review and assessment to verify that the system is working as it is supposed to, to find out where it can improve, and to correct or prevent identified problems. It is considered healthier for internal auditors to audit outside their usual management line, so as to bring a degree of independence to their judgements.

==Industry-specific interpretations==
The ISO 9001 standard is generic; its parts must be carefully interpreted to make sense within a particular organization. [[Software development process|Developing software]] is not like making [[cheese]] or offering [[counseling]] services, yet the ISO 9001 guidelines, because they are business management guidelines, can be applied to each of these.  Diverse organizations&amp;mdash;police departments (United States), professional [[soccer]] teams (Mexico), and city councils (UK)&amp;mdash;have successfully implemented ISO 9001:2000 systems.

Over time, various industry sectors have wanted to standardize their interpretations of the guidelines within their own marketplace.  This is partly to ensure that their versions of ISO 9000 have their specific requirements, but also to try and ensure that more appropriately trained and experienced auditors are sent to assess them.

* The '''[[TickIT]]''' guidelines are an interpretation of ISO 9000 produced by the UK Board of Trade to suit the processes of the information technology industry, especially software development.
* '''[[AS9000]]''' is the Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard, an interpretation developed by major aerospace manufacturers. Those major manufacturers include AlliedSignal, Allison Engine, Boeing, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Lockheed-Martin, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Grumman, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rockwell-Collins, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Sundstrand. The current version is '''[[AS9100|AS9100D]]'''.
* '''PS 9000''' * '''QS 9000''' is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (GM, Ford, Chrysler). It includes techniques such as [[failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]] and [[Advanced Product Quality Planning|APQP]]. QS 9000 is now replaced by ISO/TS 16949.
* '''[[ISO/TS 16949|ISO/TS 16949:2009]]''' is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (American and European manufacturers); the latest version is based on ISO 9001:2008. The emphasis on a process approach is stronger than in ISO 9001:2008. ISO/TS 16949:2009 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2008 and automotive industry-specific requirements.
* '''[[TL 9000]]''' is the Telecom Quality Management and Measurement System Standard, an interpretation developed by the telecom consortium, [http://www.questforum.org QuEST Forum]. In 1998 QuEST Forum developed the TL 9000 Quality Management System to meet the supply chain quality requirements of the worldwide telecommunications industry. The TL 9000 standard is made up of two handbooks: the QMS Requirements Handbook, and the QMS Measurement Handbook. The current versions of the Requirements and Measurements Handbooks are 5.0. Unlike ISO 9001 or other sector-specific standards, TL 9000 includes standardized product and process measurements that must be reported into a central repository, which allows organizations to benchmark their performance in key process areas against peer organizations. It is important to note that TL 9000 R5.0 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2008. 
* '''[[ISO 13485]]:2016''' is the medical industry's equivalent of ISO 9001. ISO 13485:2016 is a stand-alone standard. Because ISO 13485 is relevant to medical devices manufacturers (unlike ISO 9001, which is applicable to any industry), and because of the differences between the two standards relating to continual improvement, compliance with ISO 13485 does not necessarily mean compliance with ISO 9001 (and vice versa).
* '''[[ISO/IEC 90003]]:2014''' provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001 to computer software.
* '''[[ISO/TS 29001]]''' is quality management system requirements for the design, development, production, installation, and service of products for the petroleum, petrochemical, and natural gas industries.  It is equivalent to API Spec Q1 without the Monogram annex.
* '''[[ISO 22000]]''' Food Safety Management Systems.

==Effectiveness==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2013}}

The debate on the effectiveness of ISO 9000 commonly centres on the following questions:
#Are the quality principles in ISO 9001 of value?
#Does it help to implement an ISO 9001-compliant quality management system?
#Does it help to obtain ISO 9001 certification?

The effectiveness of the ISO system being implemented depends on a number of factors, the most significant of which are:
#Commitment of senior management to monitor, control, and improve quality. Organizations that implement an ISO system without this desire and commitment often take the cheapest road to get a certificate on the wall and ignore problem areas uncovered in the audits.
#How well the ISO system integrates into current business practices.  Many organizations that implement ISO try to make their system fit into a cookie-cutter quality manual instead of creating a manual that documents existing practices and only adds new processes to meet the ISO standard when necessary.
#How well the ISO system focuses on improving the customer experience.  The broadest definition of quality is "Whatever the customer perceives good quality to be."  This means that a company doesn't necessarily have to make a product that never fails; some customers will have a higher tolerance for product failures if they always receive shipments on-time or have a positive experience in some other dimension of customer service.  An ISO system should take into account all areas of the customer experience and the industry expectations, and seek to improve them on a continual basis.  This means taking into account all processes that deal with the three stakeholders (customers, suppliers, and organization); only then will a company be able to sustain improvements in the customer's experience.
#How well the auditor finds and communicates areas of improvement.  While ISO auditors may not provide consulting to the clients they audit, there is the potential for auditors to point out areas of improvement.  Many auditors simply rely on submitting reports that indicate compliance or non-compliance with the appropriate section of the standard; however, to most executives, this is like speaking a foreign language.  Auditors that can clearly identify and communicate areas for improvement in language and terms executive management understands facilitate action on improvement initiatives by the companies they audit.  When management doesn't understand why they were non-compliant and the business implications associated with non-compliance, they simply ignore the reports and focus on what they do understand.

===Advantages===
Proper quality management can improve business, often having a positive effect on investment, market share, sales growth, sales margins, competitive advantage, and avoidance of litigation.&lt;ref name="sroufe"&gt;Sroufe, Robert and Sime Curkovic, "An examination of ISO 9000:2000 and supply chain quality assurance." Journal of Operations Management, Volume 26, Issue 4, July 2008, Pages 503-520&lt;/ref&gt; The quality principles in ISO 9000:2000 are also sound, according to Wade &lt;ref name="wade"/&gt; and Barnes, who says that "ISO 9000 guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that can make any company competitive".&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt; Sroufe and Curkovic, (2008) found benefits ranging from registration required to remain part of a supply base, better documentation, to cost benefits, and improved involvement and communication with management.&lt;ref name="sroufe"/&gt; According to ISO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the myths|url=https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/archive/pdf/en/iso_9001_debunking_the_myths.pdf|website=Iso.org|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2015 version of the standard brings the following benefits:
#By assessing their context, organizations can define who is affected by their work and what they expect. This enables clearly stated business objectives and the identification of new business opportunities.  
#Organizations can identify and address the risks associated with their organization.
#By putting customers first, organizations can make sure they consistently meet customer needs and enhance customer satisfaction. This can lead to more repeat customers, new clients and increased business for the organization. 
#Organizations work in a more efficient way as all their processes are aligned and understood by everyone. This increases productivity and efficiency, bringing internal costs down. 
#Organizations will meet necessary statutory and regulatory requirements. 
#Organizations can expand into new markets, as some sectors and clients require ISO 9001 before doing business.

===Criticisms of ISO 9001 certification===
A common criticism of ISO 9000 and 9001 is the amount of money, time, and paperwork required for a complete implementation, and later when needed; ISO 9001 certification.&lt;ref name="clifford" /&gt; Dalgleish cites the "inordinate and often unnecessary paperwork burden" of ISO, and says that "quality managers feel that ISO's overhead and paperwork are excessive and extremely inefficient".&lt;ref name="dalgleish 2003"&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Dalgleish |url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/84308-probing-the-limits-br-iso-9000-more-hindrance-than-help |title=Probing the Limits - ISO 9000: More Hindrance Than Help |work=Quality Magazine |date=5 May 2003 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of minimum documentation for a minimum scope organization has been greatly reduced going from ISO 9001:2000, through ISO 9001:2008 and lastly ISO 9001:2015.

According to Barnes, "Opponents claim that it is only for documentation. Proponents believe that if a company has documented its quality systems, then most of the paperwork has already been completed".&lt;ref name="barnes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/713376-1.html |title=Good Business Sense Is the Key to Confronting ISO 9000 |first=Frank |last=Barnes |work=Review of Business |date=Spring 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227121123/http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/713376-1.html|archivedate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson suggests that ISO standards "elevate inspection of the correct procedures over broader aspects of quality", and therefore, "the workplace becomes oppressive and quality is not improved".&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt;

One study showing reasons for not adopting this standard include the risks and uncertainty of not knowing if there are direct relationships to improved quality, and what kind and how many resources will be needed.  Additional risks include how much certification will cost, increased bureaucratic processes and risk of poor company image if the certification process fails.&lt;ref name="sroufe"/&gt; According to [[John Seddon]], ISO 9001 promotes specification, [[Control (management)|control]], and procedures rather than [[understanding]] and improvement.&lt;ref name="seddon" /&gt; Wade argues that ISO 9000 is effective as a guideline, but that promoting it as a standard "helps to mislead companies into thinking that certification means better quality, ... [undermining] the need for an organization to set its own quality standards".&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bin.co.uk/IMS_May_2002.pdf |title=Is ISO 9000 really a standard? |first=Jim |last=Wade |publisher=ISO Management Systems |date=May–June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Wade argues that reliance on the specifications of ISO 9001 does not guarantee a successful quality system.

The standard is seen as especially prone to failure when a company is interested in certification before quality.&lt;ref name="seddon"/&gt; Certifications are in fact often based on customer contractual requirements rather than a desire to actually improve quality.&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="henricks"/&gt; "If you just want the certificate on the wall, chances are you will create a paper system that doesn't have much to do with the way you actually run your business", said ISO's Roger Frost.&lt;ref name="henricks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2001/december/46342.html |title=ISO a GO-Go |first=Mark |last=Henricks |work=Entrepreneur Magazine |date=December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certification by an independent auditor is often seen as the problem area, and according to Barnes, "has become a vehicle to increase consulting services".&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt;

Dalgleish argues that while "quality has a positive effect on return on investment, market share, sales growth, better sales margins and competitive advantage," "taking a quality approach is unrelated to ISO 9000 registration."&lt;ref name="dalgleish 2005"&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Dalgleish |url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/84308-probing-the-limits-br-iso-9000-more-hindrance-than-help |title=Probing the Limits: ISO 9001 Proves Ineffective |work=Quality Magazine |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ISO itself advises that ISO 9001 can be implemented without certification, simply for the quality benefits that can be achieved.&lt;ref name="isosurvey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/iso9000-14000/pdf/survey2005.pdf |title=The ISO Survey – 2005 |version=Abridged version |format=PDF |publisher=ISO |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahamson argues that fashionable management discourse such as [[Quality Circles]] tends to follow a [[Enterprise life cycle|lifecycle]] in the form of a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]], possibly indicating a [[management fad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=258636 |pages=254–285 |last1=Abrahamson |first1=E. |title=Management Fashion |volume=21 |issue=1 |journal=The Academy of Management Review |year=1996 |doi=10.5465/amr.1996.9602161572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickrell argues{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} that ISO systems merely gauge whether the processes are being followed. It does not gauge how good the processes are or whether the correct parameters are being measured and controlled to ensure quality. Furthermore, when unique technical solutions are involved in the creation of a new part, ISO does not validate the robustness of the technical solution which is a key part of advanced quality planning. It is not unheard of for an ISO-certified plant to display poor quality performance due to poor process selection and/or poor technical solutions.

[[File:. V. de Valenzuela, R. Reyes Jr., Gen. R. Reyes, and J. M. Eder.jpg|thumb|220px|James Martin Eder circa 1913 with [[Rafael Reyes Prieto]]]]

'''James Martin Eder''' (June 24, 1838&amp;nbsp;– December 26, 1921), known in [[Colombia]] as '''Santiago Martín Eder Kaiser''', '''[[Don (honorific)|don]] Santiago Eder''' or simply "El Fundador", is considered the pioneer of the [[sugar]] industry in [[Colombia]], and is widely recognized as one of Colombia's leading 19th century industrial pioneers.

==Early life==
{{main|Jews in Colombia}}
Eder was born in [[Kuldiga|Goldingen]] in the [[Duchy of Courland]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the son of Martin Sass Eder and Dorina Kaiser, and was the youngest of their seven children. In 1851 Santiago Eder immigrated from Courland to [[New York City]] where his older brother and most of his siblings already lived.  He completed his education and after some work experience entered [[Harvard Law School]] in 1858. In 1861 he moved to [[San Francisco]], and from there moved to the Colombian sea port of [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]] where he worked as a lawyer and a commercial representative for [[Panama]]nian trading firms when Panama was still part of Colombia. In 1864 he bought the [[Manuelita]] sugar and coffee farm near the city of [[Palmira, Colombia|Palmira]] in the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] Valley of Colombia. He bought this farm at a public auction in [[Cali]] from the father of leading Colombian novelist [[Jorge Isaacs]]. In 1866 Eder became the [[consul (representative)|consul]] of the [[United States]] in Buenaventura, as well as the vice-consul of [[Chile]]. In 1867 he traveled to [[London]] where he met and married Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Benjamin in the New Synagogue.  In their marriage certificate, the name of don Santiago's father is given as 'Moses Eder'. From this marriage were born his children Henry, Charles, Luisa, Walter, Phanor, Fanny and Edith Eder.

==Industrial pioneer in Colombia==

In 1901 [[Manuelita]] became the first Colombian [[sugar mill]] to move from [[mule]] to [[steam engine|steam powered]] mills. As such, don Santiago became one of Colombia's first industrialists. In 1903 he left his children Charles James and Henry James Eder in charge of his business interests and moved with his wife to [[New York City|New York]]. He remained there until his death at 83 in 1921. Eder is buried at the [[Shearith Israel]] Cemetery in [[Cypress Hills, Brooklyn]]. His nephew  [[Montague David Eder]] was one of England's Leading Zionist.

After his death, the Manuelita sugar company saw further expansions in 1927 and 1939. In 1952 under management of [[Harold Henry Eder]], Santiago's grandson, Manuelita became the first [[sugarcane]] mill in Colombia to make refined sugar. Under Santiago Eder's great grandson [[Henry James Eder]] Manuelita started an international expansion, and today is one of Colombia's leading agro/industrial companies with operations in Colombia, [[Peru]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]]. The current president of Manuelita is [[Harold Eder Garcés]], is don Santiago's great-great-grandson and belongs to the fifth generation of the Eder Family in Colombia.

Much of Santiago Eder's correspondence, mostly business related, but also dealing with the Colombian government and personal family matters, are preserved at the Phanor James Eder Collection at the [[University of Miami]].

'''John Gardiner Calkins Brainard''' (1795–1828) was an American [[lawyer]], [[editing|editor]] and [[poet]].

==Biography==
John Brainard was born in [[New London, Connecticut]], in October 1796, son of Jeremiah G. Brainard, formerly a [[judge]] of the [[Connecticut Superior Court]]. He was a descendant of [[Lion Gardiner]], an early English settler and soldier, who founded the first [[English people|English]] settlement in what became the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. His legacy includes [[Gardiners Island]], which remains in the possession of the family and is the largest privately owned island in the United States.

Brainard was tutored at home by an elder brother and entered [[Yale College]] at the age of 15 in 1811. Biographies agree that he was not an attentive student, and it is uncertain whether he graduated. Nevertheless, on leaving college he was taken on as a student at law in his brother William F. Brainard's office.&lt;ref name="Whittier"&gt;Whittier, J. G., ''[https://archive.org/details/literaryremainso00brairich The literary remains of J.G.C. Brainard: with a sketch of his life]'' (1832)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1819 he had been [[Call to the Bar|called to the bar]] and moved to [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], apparently to set up his own practice. In fact, he seems to have been apathetic about a legal career, feeling that his nature was too sensitive for such a profession. Some of his earliest poems are from this period of his life, published in a [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] literary paper, ''The Microscope'' published by one Cornelius Tuthill.&lt;ref name="Whittier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New"&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/poemsofjohngcbra00braiiala The poems of John G. C. Brainard. A new and authentic collection, with an original memoir of his life]'' (1847).&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1822, he was engaged as editor of the ''Connecticut Mirror'' in a bid to further a literary career. Again, biographies agree that this was not the ideal job for him, and that "his temperament was totally unsuited to rough collissions&lt;!--sic--&gt;  of editorial controversy". In this role he published a number of his own works within the newspaper,&lt;ref name="Whittier"/&gt; which were well received and led to a literary reputation for Brainard.&lt;ref name="New"/&gt;

He appears to have been well known and well thought of in his community.&lt;ref name="Whittier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New"/&gt; He is known to have been a friend of [[McDonald Clarke]], the so-called "Mad poet of Broadway".&lt;ref name="Appleton"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/appletonscyclopa01wils Appleton's cyclopaedia of American biography, Volume 1], (1900)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1824-5 he published a first volume, ''Occasional Pieces of Poetry by John G. C. Brainard'', being reprints of works first published in the ''Mirror'', together with a miscellany of unpublished poems.&lt;ref name="Whittier"/&gt;

By the spring of 1827, he was in failing health, suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. He returned to New London, giving up his ''Mirror'' role, but continuing to have poems published in it.&lt;ref name="Whittier"/&gt;

He died on September 26, 1828. A number of poets, including [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], wrote poems in his memory. A posthumous ''The literary remains of J.G.C. Brainard: with a sketch of his life'' was published in 1832, and revised and republished as ''The poems of John G. C. Brainard. A new and authentic collection''.&lt;ref name="Whittier"/&gt; A number of his poems are reprinted in collections of poems.

His poem "On the Project of African Colonization"&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/poems00brai&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/fk8cf9jq5n;view=1up;seq=11&lt;/ref&gt; is quoted in [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]´s book [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] at the end of chapter XXXVII "Liberty" although without credit and reference.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/203/203-h/203-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1472">'''João Carlos Di Genio''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[physician]] and [[educator]]. He created and is the main owner of the largest educational holding in the country, comprised by the [[Sistema Objetivo]] (primary, secondary and preparatory schools) and the [[Universidade Paulista]] (UNIP), a private university with more than 60 campuses all over Brazil.

Di Genio started his educational career while he was a medical student at the [[University of São Paulo]], in [[São Paulo]] in the 1960s. The mandatory entrance examination to the [[medical school]]s was increasingly tougher and many high school students. The inborn entrepreneurial spirit of di Genio led him to create a one-year preparatory pre-med course, initially in his own home. The success achieved by the course prompted him to establish a formal school, together with three of his colleagues ([[Drauzio Varella]], Tadasi Ito and Roger Patti), which was named ''Curso Pré-Vestibular Nove de Julho''. This later became the Objetivo prep course. Other educational levels were subsequently added.

== Background ==

[[File:01-jung-en.svg|400px|thumb|Administrative divisions]]
'''Jung District (Jung-gu)''' is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|''gu'']], or district, covering the downtown area of [[Daegu]], [[South Korea]].  It borders most of the other districts of Daegu, including [[Nam-gu (Daegu)|Nam-gu]] to the south, [[Seo-gu (Daegu)|Seo-gu]] to the west, [[Buk-gu (Daegu)|Buk-gu]] to the north, and [[Dong-gu (Daegu)|Dong-gu]] and [[Suseong-gu]] to the east.  The northern border is formed by the [[Gyeongbu Line]] railroad, and the eastern border by the [[Sincheon (Daegu)|Sincheon]] stream.

Jung-gu is at the nexus of [[Daegu Subway Line 1]] and [[Daegu Subway Line 2]].  [[Daegu Subway Line 3]] will also pass through the district when it is completed.

==History==
Much of Jung-gu once lay within the old confines of [[Daegu Castle]], which at one time comprised the entire town of Daegu.  A small part of the castle wall is preserved in [[Dalseong Park]].  Many historical incidents in the history of Daegu took place in the district, including the recent [[Daegu subway fire]] and the [[February 28th movement]] calling for the end of the autocratic [[First Republic of South Korea|Rhee regime]] in 1960.  The district was formally established in 1963, with the introduction of the ''gu'' system.

==Land use, demographics==
The land of Jung-gu is almost entirely developed, with only 16% greenspace remaining.  The population of Jung-gu fell steadily after peaking at 218,900 in 1980, as outlying residential districts expanded and residences were replaced by businesses.  In the mid-2000s this trend appeared to stabilize, with the 2005 population rising slightly over 2004.

==Economy and shopping==
The district has been the chief shopping center of Daegu throughout recorded history, beginning with the [[Yangnyeongsi]] and [[Seomun Market|Seomun]] markets, both of which are still in operation.  [[Chilseong Market]], a major center of hardware and furniture sales, is also located in Jung-gu.  Most of the city's department stores are located in or near the district, as are a vast number of smaller shops.
[[Daegu Metropolitan Jungang Library|Daebong Library]], the municipal library that is located here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dblib.daegu.kr/ Daegu Municipal Library website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212195324/http://www.dblib.daegu.kr/ |date=2010-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on May 5, 1971 and has 162,929 books and 931 papers as of 2011.

'''Koljo Karagiosov''' (born July 17, 1896 in Gabrovo &amp;ndash; 1972) was a famous Gabrovian industrialist, German honorary vice-consul.

The only son of  Vassil Karagiosov and Deshka Kalpazanova.  He was a grandson of [[Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov]].  He studied the Gabrovian Gymnasium. Koljo Karagiosov played viola and did paintings. Then became student in Legal in the town of [[Erlangen]] ([[Germany]]), but a few years later he graduated [[Handel Hochschule]] in [[Leipzig]].

==Working experience==
He worked as an accountant in Gabrovo and later, in 1926, he took the management of the family textile company.  As an industrialist Koljo Karagiosov travelled to Germany many times and bought new machines for the factory.

During 1934 Koljo Karagiosoff also became German honorary vice consul. In the field of business and in the field of diplomacy, he was his perfect father successor who kept on developing commercial and diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Germany.

He was Company first director up to 1947 when the Communist government nationalized the private property in Bulgaria. He and many Bulgarian industrialists were punished by the Communist Government. They were imprisoned and sent into exile because of their foreign education, knowledge, skillfulness and wealth. In the camps in Nojarevo and Belene these men worked and lived like prisons tormented by the supervisors. The Socialist party stained the reputation of all of them, announced them “enemy of the nation” and cruelly chased them. Koljo Karagiosov died in 1972.

==Charity==
Karagiosov donated money for different charity organizations, schools, churches and monasteries – The Gabrovian Library, The Women Charity organization “Mother Care” and the Red Cross. He helped his father supplying the [[Zograph Monastery]]  with   provisions which he bought in Bulgaria and sent them in Mount Athos.

==Family==
He had three children – two sons and a daughter.  The elder son Vassil was born in [[Leipzig]] in 1920.  He lived in [[Pleven]] and worked as a musician – piano player.  The second son Bozhidar was born in Gabrovo.  He worked in a PVC manufacturing company and was a singer in the Military choir in Gabrovo.  The daughter Veselinka graduated engineer in Plovdiv.  She worked in the field of Milk industry and Catering establishment. She was a skilful teacher too.

It's not about downplaying my last name as much as it is about loving Pierce. And my brother is very flattered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/2008/11/lauren_bush?currentPage=1 |title=Lauren Bush's Inaugural Designs |accessdate=February 17, 2009 |date=November 1, 2008 |work=[[W (magazine)|W]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President George H.

'''Margaret Osborne duPont''' (born '''Margaret Evelyn Osborne'''; March 4, 1918&amp;nbsp;– October 24, 2012) was a World No. 1 American female [[tennis]] player.

DuPont won a total of 37 singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles, which places her fourth on the all-time list despite never entering the [[Australian Open|Australian Championships]]. She won 25 of her Grand Slam titles at the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], which is an all-time record.

==Career==
DuPont won six [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, saving match points in the finals of the 1946 [[French Open|French Championships]] (versus [[Pauline Betz]]) and 1948 U.S. Championships (versus [[Louise Brough]]). In terms of games played, the 1948 final at the U.S. Championships is the longest women's singles final ever played at that tournament (48 games).

DuPont teamed with Louise Brough to win 20 Grand Slam women's doubles titles, which ties [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Pam Shriver]] for the most Grand Slam titles ever won by a women's doubles team. DuPont and Brough won nine consecutive titles at the U.S. Championships from 1942 through 1950. They won that tournament 12 of the 14 years they entered as a team. Their 12 titles is an all-time record for a women's doubles team at the U.S. Championships, easily surpassing the four career titles won by the teams of Navratilova and Shriver, [[Doris Hart]] and [[Shirley Fry]], and [[Sarah Palfrey]] and [[Alice Marble]]. DuPont won a total of 13 women's doubles titles at the U.S. Championships, which also is an all-time record, as is her 10 consecutive women's doubles titles at the U.S. Championships from 1941 through 1950.

DuPont won more mixed doubles titles at the U.S. Championships than any other player. She won nine titles, including four with [[William Talbert]] (a record for a mixed doubles team at the U.S. Championships) and three with [[Neale Fraser]].

According to John Olliff and Lance Tingay of ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', duPont was ranked in the world top ten from 1946 through 1950, 1953, 1954, 1956, and 1957 (no rankings issued from 1940 through 1945), reaching a career high of World No. 1 in those rankings from 1947 through 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Collins, Bud |title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis: An Authoritative Encyclopedia and Record Book |publisher=New Chapter Press |location=New York, N.Y |year=2008 |pages=695, 702–3 |isbn=0-942257-41-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont was included in the year-end top ten rankings issued by the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] in 1938, 1941 through 1950, 1953, 1956, and 1958. She was the top ranked U.S. player from 1948 through 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=United States Tennis Association |title=1988 Official USTA Tennis Yearbook |publisher=H.O. Zimman, Inc. |location=Lynn, Massachusetts |year=1988 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |pages=260–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1938 through 1958, DuPont went undefeated in ten [[Wightman Cup]] competitions, winning her ten singles and nine doubles matches. She also captained the U.S. team nine times, winning eight.

== Personal life ==
Margaret married [[William duPont, Jr.]] on November 26, 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://findingaids.hagley.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/2317_II.xml|title = William du Pont, Jr. papers (Accession 2317.II), Hagley Museum and Library, Wilmington, DE 19807|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later interrupted her career to give birth to a son, [[William du Pont III|William duPont III]] on July 22, 1952. She is one of the few women to win a major title after childbirth. DuPont never played the Australian Championships because her husband would not let her.  
{{quote|They didn't start to invite people down there and pay their expenses until I got married, and that was wintertime and Will's vacation time, and I just never got to go. He threatened to divorce me if I went to Australia, so I never went. He had that respiratory trouble, and he wanted me to come to California with him. He thought I should be with him. That was that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Billie Jean King]] with Cynthia Starr |title=We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women's Tennis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1988|isbn=0-07-034625-9 |oclc= |doi= |page= 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

She later divorced duPont in 1964 and formed a life partnership with fellow player [[Margaret Varner Bloss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Billie Jean King]] with Cynthia Starr |title=We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women's Tennis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1988|isbn=0-07-034625-9 |oclc= |doi= |page= 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DuPont died on October 24, 2012 while in hospice care in [[El Paso, Texas]] at age 94.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Awards==
She was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1967. The [[Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame]] inducted duPont in 1999. In 2010, she was inducted into the US Open Court of Champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/court/archive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829053750/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/about/court/archive.html |archivedate=2010-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pakistan German Business Forum''' (PGBF) was formed on 3 December 1997 with the active support and co-operation of [[Germany|German]] Ambassador to [[Pakistan]] who is its Patron-in-Chief as well as the German Consul-General in [[Karachi]], Dr. Axel Weishaupt actively supported '''PGBF''' in '''1997'''.

==About PGBF==

Pak-German Business Forum is responsible to promote, facilitate and support Industrial and Trade business relationship between the business communities of [[Pakistan]] and [[Germany]]. PGFB was formed on 3 December 1997.

The Ambassador of Germany in Pakistan is the Patron-in-chief of this organization. It has 160 members, comprising, heads of German multinational companies operating in Pakistan, members from organizations who have Industrial and trade relationship with Germany etc., PGBF operates in close contact with [[Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry]] (FPCCI) and other chambers and enjoys their support and recognition.

In September 1, PGBF, signed an [[Memorandum of understanding|MOU]], of business co-operation, with "Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, Rahein-Neckar, [[Mannheim]], Germany (IHK)". IHK has more than 5000 members from the German Industrial &amp; trade segments. The objective is to bring together the business communities of Pakistan &amp; Germany into direct contact through a systematic, sustainable and long term approach. Based on the success of this MOU, PGBF has the intention to sign more MOUs with different chambers in Germany to bring together the business communities of Germany and Pakistan.

The activities of PGBF are mostly concentrated in [[Karachi]]. It is felt that its activities should be extended to whole of Pakistan specially in the North of Pakistan where large industrial &amp; trade organisations, conducting business with Germany, have a strong presence.

'''Peter Folger''' or '''Foulger''' (1617&amp;nbsp;–1690) was a poet and an [[interpreter]] of the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] language for the first settlers of [[Nantucket]]. He was instrumental in the colonization of Nantucket Island in the [[Massachusetts]] colony. He was the maternal grandfather of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|pages=543 |title=The Life of Benjamin Franklin |first1=Benjamin |last1=Franklin |first2=Jared|last2=Sparks|first3=William|last3=Temple|last4=Franklin| first5=G. F.|last5= Storm|first6=Joseph|last6=Andrews |year=1856 |location=Boston |publisher=Whitman, Niles, and Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Baptist missionary, teacher, and surveyor, his dealings with the native population promoted harmony between the Native Americans and European settlers.

==Life==
Peter Folger was born in 1617 in England, the son of John Folger Jr. (b. c. 1594) and Meribah Gibbs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=3JQK3D3y2XgC&amp;pg=PA740&amp;dq=Meribah+Gibbs+John+Folger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnwsGsg8nWAhVCzlQKHeG_CwsQ6AEIFDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; He came to America in 1635, settling initially in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], and later moving to [[Martha's Vineyard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trent|first=William Peterfield|author2=Benjamin Willis Wells|title=Colonial Prose and Poetry |publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; co.|year=1903|pages=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTH_udTDkcAC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=peter+folger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---There is nothing in THIS source that says that he was born in Norwich or who his parents were----&gt; where he worked as a teacher and surveyor. In 1644, he married [[Mary Morrell Folger|Mary Morrell]], whom he met on the voyage from England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALIUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=peter+folger&amp;as_brr=3|title=New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol 16|last=|first=|publisher=Samuel G. Drake|year=1862|isbn=|location=|pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the Vineyard, Folger supported himself by teaching school and surveying land. He was hired by Governor [[Thomas Mayhew]] and his son Thomas Mayhew Jr. to convert the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population to Christianity, during which time he learned to speak the native language. He was a Baptist in faith, and as such was told not to visit with the Puritans on the mainland. Rev. [[Experience Mayhew]], in a letter to John Gardner, Esquire, dated 1694, states that when Thomas Mayhew, Jr. left for England in 1657, he left the care of his church and mission to Peter Folger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cutter|first1=William|title=American Biography: A New Cyclopedia, Volume 12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vWoKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=peter+Folger+++thomas+mayhew&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OZ3GjQP_s_&amp;sig=V4wiCWPy_3JuQHmg1iOTrTWMu70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S5JcVYm4I8uMNtDMgagO&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20Folger%20%20%20thomas%20mayhew&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From time to time between 1659 and 1662, Folger journeyed to Nantucket in order to survey it for the proprietors. In 1663 Folger moved to Nantucket full-time, having been granted a half a share of land by the proprietors, where he was a surveyor, an Indian interpreter, and clerk in the courts. Shortly thereafter, Folger's daughter, Abiah, was born, later to become the mother of [[Benjamin Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worron|first=Harriet B.|title="Trustum" and His Grandchildren|year=1881|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLkpc0vsrrwC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=peter+folger}}&lt;/ref&gt; who referred to him fondly in his autobiography.

Folger died at [[Nantucket]], Massachusetts, in 1690 and is buried in the Founders Burial Ground.&lt;ref name="Founders Burial Ground"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nha.org/library/cemeteries/infofounders.htm |title=Nantucket Founders Burial Ground Information |website=Nantucket Historical Association |accessdate=February 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Mary Morrill Folger lived until 1704.&lt;ref name="Sparks"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jared Sparks|title=The Works of Benjamin Franklin: Containing Several Political and Historical Tracts Not Included in Any Former Edition, and Many Letters, Official and Private, Not Hitherto Published; with Notes and a Life of the Author|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1sOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA543|year=1844|publisher=C.

'''Russian oligarchs''' (see the related term "[[New Russians]]") are [[business oligarch]]s of the [[former Soviet republics]] who rapidly accumulated wealth during the era of [[privatization in Russia|Russian privatization]] in the aftermath of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the 1990s. The [[Failed state| failing]] [[USSR| Soviet]] state left the ownership of state assets contested, which allowed for [[Blat (favors)| informal deals]] with former USSR officials (mostly in [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]) as a means to acquire state property. Historian [[Edward L. Keenan]] has drawn a comparison between the current Russian phenomenon of oligarchs and the system of powerful [[Boyar#Boyars in Muscovy |boyars]] which emerged in late-Medieval [[Muscovy]].&lt;ref name="Russia's Oligarchy, Alive and Well"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/opinion/russias-oligarchy-alive-and-well.html?_r=0 "Russia's Oligarchy, Alive and Well"], by Andrew S. Weiss, ''New York Times'', December 30, 2013.  {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170204210417/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/opinion/russias-oligarchy-alive-and-well.html?_r=0 |date= February 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern Russian [[oligarchy| oligarchs]] emerged as [[business sector | business-sector]] [[entrepreneur]]s under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] ([[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union| General Secretary]] 1985–1991) during his period of [[Market economy |market]] liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Scheidel|Scheidel, Walter]] (2017). ''The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century''. Princeton University Press. pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 51] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 222-223]&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}  The term [[oligarchy| "oligarch"]] derives from the Ancient Greek word ὀλιγάρχης (oligárkhēs), meaning literally "one of few rulers".

==Yeltsin era==
By the end of the Soviet era in 1991 and during [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s [[perestroika]], many Russian businessmen imported or smuggled goods such as [[personal computer]]s and [[jeans]] into the country and sold them, often on the [[black market]], for a hefty profit.
[[File:Анатолий Чубайс.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Anatoly Chubais]], the man most credited with the Yeltsin-era privatization that led to the growth of the oligarchs&lt;ref name=ProfileAnatoly&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357755.stm Profile: Anatoly Chubais,” BBC News, March 17,2005]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the 1990s, once [[Boris Yeltsin]] became [[President of Russia]] in 1991, the oligarchs emerged as well-connected entrepreneurs who started from nearly nothing and became rich through participation in the [[market (economics)|market]] via connections to the corrupt, but elected, [[government of Russia]] during the state's transition to a [[market-based economy]]. The so-called [[voucher privatization|voucher-privatization]] program enabled a handful of young men to become billionaires, specifically by [[arbitrage|arbitraging]] the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities (e.g. [[Natural gas|gas]], oil) and the prices prevailing on the world market.

Post-Soviet business oligarchs include relatives or close associates of government officials, even government officials themselves, as well as [[crime in Russia|criminal bosses]] often connected to the Russian government&lt;ref&gt;https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/organized-crime-russia&lt;/ref&gt; who achieved vast wealth by acquiring state assets very cheaply (or for free) during the [[privatization in Russia|privatization process]] controlled by the Yeltsin government of 1991–1999.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chrystia Freeland|Freeland, Chrystia]] (2000). ''Sale of the Century: Russia's Wild Ride from Communism to Capitalism''. New York: Crown Business.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific accusations of [[Corporate crime|corruption]] are often leveled at [[Anatoly Chubais]] and [[Yegor Gaidar]], two of the "Young Reformers" chiefly responsible for [[Russian privatization]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~gusev/russian/gybio.html|title=Grigory Yavlinsky|website=www.cs.ccsu.edu|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/SAM-Advanced-Management-Journal/98831087.html Privatization in Russia: its past, present, and future] SAM Advanced Management Journal, 1 January 2003.

Retrieved 31 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Satter]], author of ''Darkness at Dawn'', "what drove the process was not the determination to create a system based on [[universal value]]s but rather the will to introduce a system of private ownership, which, in the absence of law, opened the way for the criminal pursuit of money and power".&lt;ref&gt;Satter, David. ''Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State''. Yale University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, outright criminal groups – in order to avoid attention – assign front-men to serve as executives and/or "legal" owners of the companies they control.

Although the majority of oligarchs were not formally connected with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], there are allegations that they were promoted (at least initially) by the communist [[apparatchik]]s, with strong connections to Soviet power structures and access to the monetary funds of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Politics – Faking Democracy in the Post-Soviet World, [[Andrew Wilson (historian)|Andrew Wilson]], [[Yale University Press]], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braguinsky, Serguey, and Roger Myerson. "A macroeconomic model of Russian transition." ''Economics of Transition'' 15.1 (2007): 77–107.&lt;/ref&gt; Official Russian media usually depict oligarchs as the enemies of "communist forces". The latter is a [[stereotype]] that describes political power that wants to restore Soviet-style communism in Russia.

During Yeltsin's presidency (1991–1999) oligarchs became increasingly influential in Russian politics; they played a significant role in financing the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|re-election of Yeltsin in 1996]]. With [[insider information]] about financial decisions of the government, oligarchs could easily increase their wealth even further. The [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] hit some of the oligarchs hard, however, and those whose holdings were still based mainly on banking lost much of their fortunes.

The most influential and exposed oligarchs from the Yeltsin era include [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], [[Mikhail Fridman]], [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], [[Vladimir Potanin]], [[Alexander Smolensky]], [[Pyotr Aven]], [[Vladimir Vinogradov]] and [[Vitaly Malkin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/oligarchs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:LCYNMjG-y8oJ:www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1996/11/article/british-paper-names-banking-clique/316590.html+&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk British Paper Names Banking Clique] at ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', November 5, 1996 (archived)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Butrin.

''[[Kommersant]]'', March 5, 2002 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; They formed what became known as [[Semibankirschina]] (or seven bankers), a small group of business moguls with a great influence on Boris Yeltsin and his political environment. Together they controlled from 50% to 70% of all Russian finances between 1996 and 2000.

Fridman, Potanin, Aven and Malkin are the only ones on the list to have retained their influence in the Putin era, which began in 1999. Khodorkovsky, Berezovsky and Gusinsky "have been purged by the Kremlin", according to ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/19/russia Billionaires boom as Putin puts oligarchs at N2 in global rich list The Guardian, 19 Feb 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Putin era==
{{further|Russia under Vladimir Putin}}
The most famous oligarchs of the Putin era include [[Roman Abramovich]], [[Alexander Abramov]], [[Oleg Deripaska]], [[Mikhail Prokhorov]], [[Alisher Usmanov]], [[German Khan]], [[Viktor Vekselberg]], [[Leonid Mikhelson]], [[Vagit Alekperov]], [[Mikhail Fridman]], [[Vladimir Potanin]], [[Pyotr Aven]], and [[Vitaly Malkin]].

Between 2000 and 2004, Putin apparently engaged in a power-struggle with some oligarchs, reaching a "grand bargain" with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain their powers, in exchange for their explicit support of – and alignment with – Putin's government.&lt;ref&gt;''Putin: Russia's Choice''. Richard Sakwa, (Routledge, 2008) pp 143-150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Playing Russian Roulette: Putin in search of good governance, by Andre Mommen, in ''Good Governance in the Era of Global is  Neoliberalism: Conflict and Depolitisation in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa'', by Jolle Demmers, Alex E. Fernández Jilberto, Barbara Hogenboom (Routledge, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Many more [[business people]] have become oligarchs during Putin's time in power, and often due to personal relations with Putin, such as the rector of the institute where Putin obtained a degree in 1996, [[Vladimir Litvinenko]],&lt;ref name="Bureau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/03/02/the-fabulous-riches-of-putins-inner-circle/ |title=The fabulous riches of Putin's inner circle |publisher=The Bureau Investigates |accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Putin's childhood friend and [[judo]]-teacher [[Arkady Rotenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/russian-oligarchs-2013-4/ Oligarchology] by Alex Yablon, ''New York Magazine'', Mar 31, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, other analysts argue that the oligarchic structure has remained intact under Putin, with Putin devoting much of his time to mediating power-disputes between rival oligarchs.&lt;ref name="Russia's Oligarchy, Alive and Well" /&gt; Some had been imprisoned, such as [[Mikhael Mirilashvili]].

During Putin's presidency, a number of oligarchs came under fire for various illegal activities, particularly [[tax evasion]] in the businesses they acquired. However, it is widely speculated and believed that the charges were also politically motivated per these tycoons falling out of favor with the Kremlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/european_court_rules_khodorkovskys_rights_violated/24210627.html European Court Rules That Khodorkovsky's Rights Were Violated], Radio Free Europe, 31 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/22/former-russian-tycoon-mikhail-khodorkovsky-first-news-conference-released-prison/ "Khodorkovsky speaks out on plight of Russia's political prisoners"].

This was subsequently extended to 14 years, and after Putin pardoned him,  he was released on 20 December 2013.&lt;ref name="YukosCase"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hague court awards $50 bn compensation to Yukos shareholders|url=http://www.russiaherald.com/index.php/sid/224207121/scat/723971d98160d438/ht/Hague-court-awards-50-bn-compensation-to-Yukos-shareholders|accessdate=29 July 2014 |work=Russia Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'oligarch' has also been applied to technology investors such as [[Yuri Milner]], although without involvement in Russian politics.&lt;ref name=wired-mag&gt;[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/10/mf_milner/all/ Wired Magazine: "How Russian Tycoon Yuri Milner Bought His Way Into Silicon Valley" by Michael Wolff] October 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of the out-of-favor oligarchs, often associated with Chubais's party—the [[Union of Right Forces]], argue that the companies they acquired were not highly valued at the time because they still ran on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] principles, with non-existent [[stock control|stock-control]], huge payrolls, no financial reporting and scant regard for profit. They turned the businesses around and made them profitable for shareholders. They obtain little sympathy from the Russian public due to resentment over the economic disparity they represent.

An economic study distinguishes 21 oligarchic groups as of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Guriev |first1= Sergei |last2= Rachinsky |first2= Andrei |title= The role of oligarchs in Russian capitalism |journal= Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=2005|pages=131-150|doi= 10.1257/0895330053147994|url= https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0895330053147994 |volume=19|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed 36 billionaires of Russian citizenship, with a note: "this list includes businessmen of Russian citizenship who acquired the major share of their wealth privately, while not holding a governmental position". In 2005, the number of billionaires dropped to 30, mostly because of the [[Yukos]] case, with Khodorkovsky dropping from #1 (US$15.2&amp;nbsp;billion) to #21 (US$2.0&amp;nbsp;billion).

A 2013 report by Credit Suisse found that 35% of the wealth of Russia was owned by the wealthiest 110 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The world's wealthy: where on earth are the richest 1%? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/oct/09/worlds-wealthy-where-russia-rich-list |website=The Guardian |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billionaire, philanthropist, art patron and former KGB agent [[Alexander Lebedev]] has criticized the oligarchs, saying "I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption." Lebedev has also described them as "a bunch of uncultured ignoramuses", saying "They don't read books. They don't have time. They don't go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht." He also notes that the oligarchs have no interest in social injustice.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/25/russian-oligarchs-oleg-deripaska |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Twilight of the oligarchs |first=Luke |last=Harding |date=October 25, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the [[USA Treasury]] published a [[Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act#List of Russian tycoons named in the CAATSA unclassified report|"list of oligarchs" per Pub.L. 115–44]].

===Oligarchs in London===
A significant number of Russian oligarchs have bought homes in upmarket sections of [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Weiss, ''IN PLAIN SIGHT: The Kremlin's London Lobby'', World Affairs, Vol. 175, No. 6 (MARCH / APRIL 2013), pp. 84-91.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]], which has been dubbed "Moscow on Thames."&lt;ref&gt;According to British journalist Nick Watt, reporting for ABC's ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''. (broadcast of June 1, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as [[Eugene Shvidler]], [[Alexander Knaster]], [[Konstantin Kagalovsky]] and Abram Reznikov, are [[expatriate]]s, having taken permanent residency in London. This community has led to journalists calling the city "Londongrad". Most own homes in both countries as well as property and have acquired controlling interests in major European companies. They commute on a regular basis between the [[European Union|EU]] and Russia; in many cases their families reside in London, with their children attending school there. In 2007 Abram Reznikov bought one of Spain's mega recycling companies, Alamak Espana Trade SL, while [[Roman Abramovich]] bought the English football club, [[Chelsea F.C.]], in 2003, spending record amounts on players' salaries.&lt;ref&gt;"Over there: American and other foreign owners are revolutionizing British football", ''[[Boston Globe]],'' May 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The billionaire Moscow oligarch [[Mikhail Fridman]], Russia's second richest man as of 2016, is currently restoring [[Athlone House]] in London as a primary residence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/new_athlone_house_owner_i_want_to_restore_it_to_its_former_glory_1_4598330 New Athlone House owner: ‘I want to restore it to its former glory’] 11:21 30 June 2016 Anna Behrmann, Ham and High&lt;/ref&gt; to be worth an estimated £130 million when restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.aol.co.uk/2016/09/15/billionaires-plans-for-derelict-mansion-approved Billionaire's plans for £65 million derelict mansion approved] By Emma Woollacott Sep 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 global recession and credit crisis===
According to the financial news-agency [[Bloomberg L.P.]], Russia's wealthiest 25 individuals have collectively lost US $230&amp;nbsp;billion (£146 billion) since July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Chorafas, D. ''Capitalism without capital''.

Billionaires in Russia and Ukraine have been particularly hard-hit by lenders seeking repayment on [[balloon loan]]s in order to shore up their own balance sheets. Many oligarchs took out generous loans from Russian banks, bought shares, and then took out more loans from western banks against the value of these shares.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/business/2008/10/23/billionaires-margin-calls-biz-billies-cx_af_1023billiemargin.html |title=Margin Calls Ignite Billionaire Fire Sale|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026022503/http://www.forbes.com/business/2008/10/23/billionaires-margin-calls-biz-billies-cx_af_1023billiemargin.html|archivedate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to get hit by the global downturn was [[Oleg Deripaska]], Russia's richest man at the time, who had a net worth of US$28&amp;nbsp;billion in March 2008. As Deripaska borrowed money from western banks using shares in his companies as collateral, the collapse in share price forced him to sell holdings to satisfy the [[margin call]]s.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes.com" /&gt;

'''Sokratis Kokkalis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Σωκράτης Κόκκαλης; 1939) is a Greek billionaire businessman. His father, [[Petros Kokkalis]], was a communist politician and [[Greek Resistance]] member, living in exile in [[East Germany]] after the end of the [[Greek Civil War]].

==Business==
Kokkalis is the founder and majority shareholder of [[Intracom]] Holdings, one of the largest multinational technology groups in Southern Europe{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}, and the Chairman and majority shareholder of [[Intralot|Intralot S.A.]], a [[Video game|gaming]] technology supplier and licensed lottery operator. He has established and presides over the [[Kokkalis Foundation]], a non-profit organization that "promotes education and training, culture and social welfare, medical research and information technology, and athletics", both in Greece and abroad. In 2015 Socrates Kokkalis net worth is estimated to be around US$1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rich List 2005: Top Ten Wealthiest Dynasties in Greece and Turkey|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/blog/2006/01/24/the-rich-list-2005-top-ten-wealthiest-dynasties-in-greece-and-turkey/|accessdate=29 March 2015|work=Business Insider|date=24 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokkalis founded Intracom in 1977 as a telecommunication equipment supplier and manufacturer. The company played a leading role in the modernization of telecommunication infrastructure in Greece, especially through a partnership with [[Ericsson]] for the manufacturing of digital switches. Intracom expanded in Southeastern Europe and became a leading exporting technology Group, including the areas of software for the public sector, defense electronics and construction. It is listed in the [[Athens Stock Exchange]] since 1990.

Kokkalis founded Intralot in 1992, as a hardware and software supplier for the gaming industry. Intralot became one of the three top companies in the sector worldwide, currently with 5,400 employees and presence in 35 countries. Intralot has a strong presence in the [[United States]], with a 20% market share for lotteries, offering its services to 11 [[State lotteries|State Lotteries]].

Kokkalis also led [[Panafon]], the mobile venture of [[Vodafone]] in Greece, immediately after the launch of mobile telephony in Greece in 1992.

In 2005 INTRACOM became a Holding company and acquired [[Hellas Online]], an ISP provider which became a major telephony and Internet supplier. Hellas Online was sold to Vodafone in 2014. The same year Intracom Holdings divested also form the telecom manufacturing arm, Intracom Telecom. The Holding today owns three major companies, the construction branch Intrakat, the software developer Intrasoft International, which is an ORACLE partner and a major supplier to the European Commission and the European Parliament, and Intracom Defense Electronics, with a strong partnership with RAYTHEON. The three companies today employ 2,200  people and have presence in 70 countries around the world. Most of the Group revenues come from exports and international activities.

==Football==
Kokkalis was, for 18 years until 30 December 2010, owner and chairman of the Greek football club [[Olympiacos FC]]. He took the club after the difficult years of the [[George Koskotas|Koskotas scandal]] and managed to bring it back in success.

During his tenure the club won 12 [[Superleague Greece|top division]] titles, five [[Greek football Cup|Greek Cups]], and one [[Greek Super Cup]]. It was also during his chairmanship that Olympiacos leased from the Greek state and for a period of 50 years their homeground [[Karaiskakis Stadium]], which was until that time used by Olympiacos and other Piraeus clubs strictly on a rental basis, and undertook a complete rebuilding of the stadium itself.&lt;ref name=ath&gt;[http://www.athensnews.gr/issue/13425/35949 "End of an era as Kokkalis retires"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210083520/http://www.athensnews.gr/issue/13425/35949 |date=December 10, 2011 }}, ''[[Athens News]]'', 8 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
German authorities' investigations in the [[Stasi]] archives found a 350-page report referring to agent "Rocco" ("953/63") and later "Kaskade" and "Krokus".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/el/capital-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-stasi-%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%BC%CF%85%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%87%CE%BF%CF%82/a-3704613 Capital: «Από πράκτορας της Stasi, δισεκατομμυριούχος]&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that "Rocco" was the code name for Sokratis Kokkalis, allegedly recruited on 25 January 1963.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Kokkalis was alleged to have subsequently bribed Greek officials in order for the [[OTE|national telecommunications company of Greece]] to purchase [[East Germany|East German]] telecommunications equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101226172054/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/olympiakos-soccer-chief-was-spy-for-stasi-661893.html Olympiakos soccer chief was 'spy for Stasi'], ''[[The Independent]]'', 24 February 2002 {{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1832174.stm "Stasi spy claims hit Greek magnate"], [[BBC News]], 20 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Federal Parliament, conducted a detailed investigation and concluded in 1998, that there has been no evidence linking Kokkalis activities and his companies to the DDR.

Kostas Tsimas, a former chief of the Greek intelligence service (EYP) and very close friend of former Greek Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]], stated that Kokkalis is "a Greek patriot", who "worked for Greek national interests in the Balkans and elsewhere".&lt;ref&gt;Eleftherotypia, February 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokkalis was criticized by Greek and international media about his activities in Russia, where his company Intralot had sold lottery equipment, technological know-how and software.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; However, no formal charges were ever filed for any Intralot representative, and the Russian government expressed its trust in Kokkalis and Intralot.&lt;ref name=attack&gt;[https://archive.is/20130217163734/http://www.athensnews.gr/old_issue/12950/7563 "Kokkalis under attack], ''Athens News'', 22 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive criticism was also received in the Romanian press by Kokkalis and the companies Intralot and Intracom for allegedly bribing Romanian officials into signing and extending contracts between the Greek firms and the Romanian Lottery that were thoroughly disadvantageous for the Romanian side, with losses totalling up to 1bn Euros as of April 2014.&lt;ref name=articleRomanian1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ziuanews.ro/dezvaluiri-investigatii/mafie-si-spionaj-la-compania-greceasca-intralot-cea-care-a-tepuit-si-romania-de-sute-de-milioane-de-euro-98110 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011135434/http://www.ziuanews.ro/dezvaluiri-investigatii/mafie-si-spionaj-la-compania-greceasca-intralot-cea-care-a-tepuit-si-romania-de-sute-de-milioane-de-euro-98110 |archivedate=2013-10-11 |df= }}, ''Ziua News'', 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=articleRomanian2&gt;[http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Special/Romania+furata/ROMANIA+FURATA+Politicienii+si+firmele+care+au+pagubit+Loteria+R], ''Digi24'', 2 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Kokkalis was made a [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] fellow in 1997, and received awards from The [[Fulbright Foundation]] and the [[American Academy of Achievement]] for "his leadership in creating educational opportunities and building bridges of cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaepis.org/pages/PhidippidesAward-SOCRATESP.KOKKALIS.htm Socrates P. Kokkalis] biography at Cosmos FM radio station's website&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Kokkalis founded a scholarship program at Harvard bearing his name, which during 15 years offered fellowships for 80 graduates of master's degree Programs at Harvard Kennedy School of Government and 3,000 Executive Training opportunities for individuals from Southeastern Europe.

'''Theodore Lewis "Ted" Bates''' (September 11, 1901 – May 30, 1972) was an American [[advertising]] executive who founded a worldwide [[advertising agency]] that bears his name: [[Ted Bates (advertising firm)|Ted Bates Inc.]]

==Biography==
Born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], Bates attended [[Phillips-Andover Academy]], then graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1924. He founded Ted Bates &amp; Co. in 1940, which evolved into the 21st-century advertising agency [[Bates 141]]. His empire launched in Asia in the early 1960s after acquiring a stake in Cathay Advertising from [[George Patterson (advertiser)|George Patterson]], an Australian advertising executive.  Cathay Advertising was used by Bates as a vehicle to drive expansion in the region so that by the late 1960s, Ted Bates Inc. was operating in [[Manila]], [[Bangkok]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Bates-Worldwide-Inc-Company-History.html Bates Worldwide, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1982, the [[American Advertising Federation]] (AAF) inducted Bates with [[Charles H. Brower]] and [[Bernice Fitz-Gibbon]] to the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]]. His creative partner, advertising maverick [[Rosser Reeves]], described the reasons for Bates' success at the induction: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two things not commonly known which I want to put on the record today. Very early on at one fell swoop, Ted Bates gave away 90 percent of his agency to his key people. When I asked him why, he said, 'Rosser, I would rather own 10 percent of a success than 100 percent of a failure.' And that leads to the other thing. By making us rich and therefore making us work like demons, Ted built an agency that for the first 26 consecutive years did not lose a client...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advertisinghalloffame.org/nominations/ahof09_cfn.pdf Advertising Hall of Fame] (official site)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''[[Textile]] manufacturing''' is a major [[Textile industry|industry]]. It is based on the conversion of [[fiber]] into [[yarn]], yarn into [[fabric]]. These are then [[Dyeing|dyed]] or printed, fabricated into [[clothing|clothes]]. Different types of fibers are used to produce yarn. [[Cotton]] remains the most important natural fiber, so is treated in depth. There are many variable processes available at the [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and fabric-forming stages coupled with the complexities of the [[Finishing (textiles)|finishing]] and colouration processes to the production of a wide ranges of products. There remains a large industry that uses [[Textile manufacturing by pre-industrial methods|hand techniques]] to achieve the same results.

Cotton is the world's most important natural fibre. In the year 2007, the global yield was 25 million tons from 35 million hectares cultivated in more than 50 countries.&lt;ref name="Majeed"/&gt;

There are six stages:&lt;ref name="Processes"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/industry/machproc.php |title=Machine processes|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivating and harvesting===
[[Gossypium|Cotton]] is grown anywhere with long, hot dry summers with plenty of sunshine and low humidity. Indian cotton, gossypium arboreum, is finer but the staple is only suitable for hand processing. American cotton, gossypium hirsutum, produces the longer staple needed for machine production.&lt;ref name="CRT"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.craftrevival.org/voiceDetails.asp?Code=25|title= Handicrafts India.|publisher=Craft Revival Trust,|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planting is from September to mid November and the crop is harvested between March and June. The [[cotton|cotton bolls]] are harvested by stripper harvesters and spindle pickers, that remove the entire boll from the plant. The cotton boll is the seed pod of the cotton plant, attached to each of the thousands of seeds are fibres about 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name="Cultivating"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=64&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Cultivation+%26amp%3B+harvesting |title=Cultivating and Harvesting|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Ginning'''
::The seed cotton goes into a [[Cotton gin]]. The cotton gin separates seeds and removes the "trash" (dirt, stems and leaves) from the fibre. In a saw gin, circular saws grab the fibre and pull it through a grating that is too narrow for the seeds to pass. A roller gin is used with longer staple cotton. Here a leather roller captures the cotton. A knife blade, set close to the roller, detaches the seeds by drawing them through teeth in circular saws and revolving brushes which clean them away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: The ginned cotton fibre, known as lint, is then compressed into bales which are about 1.5 m tall and weigh almost 220 kg. Only 33% of the crop is usable lint. Commercial cotton is priced by quality, and that broadly relates to the average length of the staple, and the variety of the plant. Longer staple cotton (2½ in to 1¼ in) is called Egyptian, medium staple (1¼ in to ¾ in) is called American upland and short staple (less than ¾ in) is called Indian.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::The cotton seed is pressed into a cooking oil. The husks and meal are processed into animal feed, and the stems into paper.

*'''Opening and cleaning'''
[[File:Catalonia Terrassa mNATEC Batuar 1885.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|Platt Bros. Picker]]
::[[Cotton mill]]s get the cotton shipped to them in large, 500 pound bales. When the cotton comes out of a bale, it is all packed together and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes. It is called an '''Opener'''. In order to fluff up the cotton and remove the vegetable matter, the cotton is sent through a picker, or similar machines. The cotton is fed into a machine known as a '''picker''', and gets beaten with a beater bar in order to loosen it up. It is fed through various rollers, which serve to remove the vegetable matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers till it emerges as a continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Preparatory"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=65&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Preparatory+processes |title=Preparatory Processes|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Mixing and [[Scutching]]
Scutching refers to the process of cleaning cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.

[[File:Catalonia Terrassa mNATEC Pentinadora.jpg|thumb|200px|A Combing machine]] 
:Carding: the fibres are separated and then assembled into a loose strand (sliver or tow) at the conclusion of this stage.
::The cotton comes off of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to carding machines. The carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver; a large rope of fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=66,67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Note: In a wider sense Carding can refer to these four processes: Willowing- loosening the fibres; Lapping- removing the dust to create a flat sheet or lap of cotton; Carding- combing the tangled lap into a thick rope of 1/2 inch in diameter, a sliver; and Drawing- where a drawing frame combines 4 slivers into one- repeated for increased quality.
*'''Combing''' is optional, but is used to remove the shorter fibres, creating a stronger yarn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Drawing''' the fibres are straightened
::Several slivers are combined. Each sliver will have thin and thick spots, and by combining several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. Since combining several slivers produces a very thick rope of cotton fibres, directly after being combined the slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::Generally speaking, for machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil.
::*Drawing frame: Draws the strand out
::*Slubbing Frame: adds twist, and winds onto bobbins
::*Intermediate Frames: are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn.
::*Roving frames: reduces to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinning - yarn manufacture===
{{Main|Cotton-spinning machinery}}
*'''[[Spinning (textiles)|Spinning]]'''
::Most spinning today is done using [[Open end spinning|Break or Open-end spinning]], this is a technique where the staples are blown by air into a rotating drum, where they attach themselves to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and [[electrostatic]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method has replaced the older methods of ring and mule spinning. It is also easily adapted for [[Synthetic fiber|artificial fibres]].
::The spinning machines takes the roving, thins it and twists it, creating yarn which it winds onto a bobbin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::In [[Spinning mule|mule spinning]] the roving is pulled off a bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several different speeds. This thins the roving at a consistent rate. If the roving was not a consistent size, then this step could cause a break in the yarn, or could jam the machine. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped bundle of fibres known as a "cop", as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than the less skilled [[ring spinning]].&lt;ref name="RingMule"&gt;{{Citation|last=Saxonhouse|first=Gary|title=Technological Evolution in Cotton Spinning, 1878-1933|url=http://www.textile-technology.com/SST_Seminars/Jeremy.pdf|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2009-01-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716213233/http://www.textile-technology.com/SST_Seminars/Jeremy.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::*The mule was an intermittent process, as the frame advanced and returned a distance of 5ft.It was the descendant of 1779 Crompton device. It produces a softer less twisted thread that was favoured for fines and for weft.
::*The ring was a descendant of the Arkwright water Frame 1769. It was a continuous process, the yarn was coarser, had a greater twist and was stronger so was suited to be warp. Ring spinning is slow due to the distance the thread must pass around the ring, other methods have been introduced.
::Sewing thread, was made of several threads twisted together, or doubled.

*'''Checking'''
::This is the process where each of the bobbins is rewound to give a tighter bobbin.
*'''Folding and twisting'''
::Plying is done by pulling yarn from two or more bobbins and twisting it together, in the opposite direction that in which it was spun. Depending on the weight desired, the cotton may or may not be plied, and the number of strands twisted together varies.&lt;ref name="Spinning"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=66&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Spinning |title=Spinning|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gassing'''
{{Main|Singe#Textiles|Gassing (textile process)}}
::&lt;!-- Not certain where this process should go --&gt; Gassing is the process of passing yarn, as distinct from fabric very rapidly through a series of Bunsen gas flames in a gassing frame, in order to burn off the projecting fibres and make the thread round and smooth and also brighter. Only the better qualities of yarn are gassed, such as that used for voiles, poplins, venetians, gabardines, many Egyptian qualities, etc. There is a loss of weight in gassing, which varies' about 5 to 8 per cent., so that if a 2/60's yarn is required 2/56's would be used. The gassed yarn is darker in shade afterwards, but should not be scorched.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurements====
{{main|Units of textile measurement}}
*Cotton Counts: Refers to the thickness of the cotton yarn where 840 yards of yarns weighs {{convert|1|lb|kg}}. 10 count cotton means that {{convert|8400|yd|m}} of yarn weighs {{convert|1|lb|kg}}. This is coarser than 40 count cotton where 40x840 yards are needed. In the United Kingdom, Counts to 40s are coarse (Oldham Counts), 40 to 80s are medium counts and above 80 is a fine count. In the United States ones to 20s are coarse counts.
*Hank: A length of 7 leas or 840 yards (the worsted hank is only 560 yd&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Thread: A length of 54 in (the circumference of a warp beam)
*Bundle: Usually 10&amp;nbsp;lb
*Lea: A length of 80 threads or 120 yards&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=Cotton count}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Denier: this is an alternative method. It is defined as a number that is equivalent to the weight in grams of 9000m of a single yarn. 15 denier is finer than 30 denier.
*Tex: is the weight in grams of 1&amp;nbsp;km of yarn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weaving-fabric manufacture===
The weaving process uses a [[loom]]. The lengthway threads are known as the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]], and the cross way threads are known as the [[weft]]. The warp, which must be strong, needs to be presented to loom on a warp beam. The weft passes across the loom in a [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], that carries the yarn on a [[pirn]]. These pirns are automatically changed by the loom. Thus, the yarn needs to be wrapped onto a beam, and onto pirns before weaving can commence.&lt;ref name="Weaving"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=66&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Weaving |title=Weaving|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Winding'''
::After being spun and plied, the cotton thread is taken to a warping room where the winding machine takes the required length of yarn and winds it onto warpers bobbins
*'''Warping or beaming'''
[[File:Catalonia Terrassa mNATEC Ordidor.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|A Warper]]
::Racks of bobbins are set up to hold the thread while it is rolled onto the warp bar of a loom. Because the thread is fine, often three of these would be combined to get the desired thread count.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
*'''[[Sizing#Textile warp sizing|Sizing]]'''
::Slasher sizing machine needed for strengthening the warp by adding starch to reduce breakage of the yarns.
*'''Drawing in, Looming'''
::The process of drawing each end of the warp separately through the dents of the [[reed (weaving)|reed]] and the eyes of the healds, in the order indicated by the draft.&lt;!--The drawing-in of the warp threads through the eyes of the healds on the principle that every end that works alike may be drawn on the same shaft. Sometimes the least possible number of shafts is not an advantage. The number of heald shafts required is shown by the draft as every end that lifts differently from others must be on its own shaft. Thus a 6-end twill requires 6 shafts, a 12-end, 12 shafts, and so on.--&gt;
*'''Pirning (Processing the weft)'''
::Pirn winding frame was used to transfer the weft from cheeses of yarn onto the pirns that would fit into the shuttle
*'''[[Weaving]]'''
{{main|Power loom}}
::At this point, the thread is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage anywhere from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 [[Lancashire Loom]]s. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked for such things as a broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle going straight across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these [[Northrop Loom]]s or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{Citation|last=Fowler|first=Alan |title=Lancashire Cotton Operatives and Work, 1900-1950: A Social History of Lancashire Cotton Operatives in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., |year=2003|pages=90|isbn=0-7546-0116-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7GHLv-rLifgC&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::&lt;!--SHED-
The space between the two lines of warp threads caused by raising one portion and depressing the other. The mechanism employed for this raising and lowering, termed 'shedding motions’ are healds, tappets, dobbies, and jacquards. The shuttle passes through this space or shed and leaves a pick of weft behind which is beaten up by the [[reed (weaving)|reed]] and the shed changed for the next pick.--&gt;
[[File:Strickmaschine im Museum.JPG|thumb|200px|A Draper loom in textile museum, [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] ]]
:::The three primary movements of a loom are shedding, picking, and beating-up.
::::*''Shedding'': The operation of dividing the warp into two lines, so that the shuttle can pass between these lines. There are two general kinds of sheds-"open" and "closed." Open Shed-The warp threads are moved when the pattern requires it-from one line to the other. Closed Shed-The warp threads are all placed level in one line after each pick.
::::*''Picking'':The operation of projecting the shuttle from side to side of the loom through the division in the warp threads. This is done by the overpick or underpick motions. The overpick is suitable for quick-running looms, whereas the underpick is best for heavy or slow looms.
::::*''Beating-up'': The third primary movement of the loom when making cloth, and is the action of the [[reed (weaving)|reed]] as it drives each pick of weft to the fell of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=Shed}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::: The [[Lancashire Loom]] was the first semi-automatic loom. [[Jacquard loom]]s and [[Dobby loom]]s are looms that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate looms, or mechanisms added to a plain loom. A [[Northrop Loom]] was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern looms run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet looms, water jet looms and [[rapier looms]].&lt;br&gt;
====Measurements====
* Ends and Picks: Picks refer to the weft, ends refer to the warp. The coarseness of the cloth can be expressed as the [[Units of textile measurement#Picks per inch|number of picks]] and [[Units of textile measurement#Ends per inch|ends]] per quarter inch square, or per inch square. Ends is always written first. For example: ''Heavy domestics are made from coarse yarns, such as 10's to 14's warp and weft, and about 48 ends and 52 picks.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=Ends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issues====
When a hand loom was located in the home, children helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and a child can be as productive as an adult. When weaving moves from the home to the mill, children are often allowed to ''help'' their older sisters, and laws have to be made to prevent [[child labor|child labour]] becoming established.

===Knitting — fabric manufacture===
[[File:Rundstrickmaschine Nadel scharf.jpg|left|thumb|A circular knitting machine.]]
[[File:Rundstrickmaschine Zungennadeln.jpg|thumb|Close-up on the needles.]]
{{main|Knitted fabric}}

[[Knitting]] by [[Knitting machine|machine]] is done in two different ways; warp and weft. Weft knitting (as seen in the pictures) is similar in method to hand knitting with stitches all connected to each other horizontally. Various weft machines can be configured to produce textiles from a single spool of [[yarn]] or multiple spools depending on the size of the machine cylinder (where the needles are bedded). In a [[warp knitting|warp knit]] there are many pieces of yarn and there are vertical chains, zigzagged together by crossing the cotton yarn.

Warp knits do not stretch as much as a weft knit, and it is run-resistant. A weft knit is not run-resistant, but stretches more. This is especially true if spools of [[spandex]] are processed from separate spool containers and interwoven through the cylinder with cotton yarn, giving the finished product more [[Spandex|flexibility]] and making it less prone to having a 'baggy' appearance. The average [[t-shirt]] is a weft knit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier 1970|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finishing — processing of textiles===
The woven cotton fabric in its loom-state not only contains impurities, including warp size, but requires further treatment in order to develop its full textile potential. Furthermore, it may receive considerable added value by applying one or more finishing processes.&lt;ref name="Finishing"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=68&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Finishing|title=Finishing|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DG"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://website.lineone.net/~davghalgh/cotton_finishing.html|title=Cotton finishing|last=GREENHALGH|first=DAVID|year=2005|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Desizing]]'''
::Depending on the size that has been used, the cloth may be steeped in a dilute acid and then rinsed, or enzymes may be used to break down the size.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Scouring'''
::Scouring, is a chemical washing process carried out on cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called [[Boiler|kier]]s. The fabric is boiled in an [[alkali]], which forms a soap with free fatty acids ([[saponification]]). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] can be boiled under pressure, excluding [[oxygen]] which would degrade the [[cellulose]] in the fibre. If the appropriate [[reagent]]s are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and is considered to be a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=155"/&gt;

*'''Bleaching'''
{{Main|Textile bleaching}}
::Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined by the required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an [[oxidizing agent]], such as dilute [[sodium hypochlorite]] or dilute [[hydrogen peroxide]]. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Mercerising'''
{{Main|Mercerized cotton}}
::A further possibility is mercerizing during which the fabric is treated with caustic soda solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]] will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on grey cloth, or after bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Many other chemical treatments may be applied to cotton fabrics to produce low flammability, crease resist and other special effects but four important non-chemical finishing treatments are:

*'''Singeing'''
{{Main|Singe#Textiles}}
::Singeing is designed to burn off the surface fibres from the fabric to produce smoothness. The fabric passes over brushes to raise the fibres, then passes over a plate heated by gas flames.

*'''Raising'''
::Another finishing process is raising. During raising, the fabric surface is treated with sharp teeth to lift the surface fibres, thereby imparting hairiness, softness and warmth, as in flannelette.

*'''Calendering'''
{{Main|Calender}}
::Calendering is the third important mechanical process, in which the fabric is passed between heated rollers to generate smooth, polished or embossed effects depending on roller surface properties and relative speeds.

*'''Shrinking (Sanforizing)'''
{{Main|Sanforization}}
::Finally, mechanical shrinking (sometimes referred to as sanforizing), whereby the fabric is forced to shrink width and/or lengthwise, creates a fabric in which any residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering is minimal.

*'''Dyeing'''
{{Main|Dyeing}}
::Finally, cotton is an absorbent fibre which responds readily to colouration processes. Dyeing, for instance, is commonly carried out with an anionic direct dye by completely immersing the fabric (or yarn) in an aqueous dyebath according to a prescribed procedure. For improved fastness to washing, rubbing and light, other dyes such as vats and reactives are commonly used. These require more complex chemistry during processing and are thus more expensive to apply.

*'''Printing'''
{{Main|Textile printing}}
::Printing, on the other hand, is the application of colour in the form of a paste or ink to the surface of a fabric, in a predetermined pattern. It may be considered as localised dyeing. Printing designs onto already dyed fabric is also possible.

===Economic, environmental and political consequences of cotton manufacture===
Production of cotton requires [[arable land]].
In addition, cotton is farmed intensively and uses large amounts of fertilizer and 25% of the world's insecticides. Native Indian varieties of cotton were rainwater fed, but modern hybrids used for the mills need irrigation, which spreads pests. The 5% of cotton-bearing land in India uses 55% of all pesticides used in India.&lt;ref name="CRT"/&gt; In [[United Kingdom]] some companies design cloths for manufacturers such as Sewport,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sewport.co.uk/fashion-manufacturing-company-sewport/|title=Sewport Ltd London|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=Sewport Ltd London|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624161035/http://www.sewport.co.uk/fashion-manufacturing-company-sewport/|archive-date=2015-06-24|dead-url=yes|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bridge &amp; Stitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bridgeandstitch.com/|title=Bridge &amp; Stitch, Clothing Design and Manufacturer|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=Bridge &amp; Stitch|access-date=2017-02-17|work=|language=en-GB|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/sep/11/fashion-entrepreneurs-how-find-factory-make-products|title=Fashion entrepreneurs: How to find a factory to make your products|last=Lewis|first=Perri|date=2014-09-11|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consumption of energy in form of water and electricity is relatively high, especially in processes like washing, de-sizing, bleaching, rinsing, dyeing, printing, coating and finishing. Processing is time consuming. The major portion of water in textile industry is used for wet processing of textile (70 per cent). Approximately 25 per cent of energy in the total textile production like fibre production, spinning, twisting, weaving, knitting, clothing manufacturing etc. is used in dyeing. About 34 per cent of energy is consumed in spinning, 23 per cent in weaving, 38 per cent in chemical wet processing and five per cent in miscellaneous processes. Power dominates consumption pattern in spinning and weaving, while thermal energy is the major factor for chemical wet processing.&lt;ref name="Majeed"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.dawn.com/2009/01/19/ebr5.htm|title= Cotton and textiles — the challenges ahead|last=Majeed|first=A|date=January 19, 2009 |publisher=Dawn-the Internet edition|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton acts as a [[carbon sink]] as it contains [[Cellulose#Structure_and_properties|cellulose]] and this contains 44,44% carbon. However, due to carbon emissions from fertiliser application, use of mechanized tools to harvest the cotton, ... cotton manufacture tends to emit more CO² than what it stores in the form of cellulose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awsassets.wwfindia.org/downloads/wwf___cotton_carbon_emission.pdf Cutting cotton carbon emissions -Findings from Warangal, India]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of cotton is divided into two segments i.e. organic and [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]].&lt;ref name="Majeed"/&gt; Cotton crop provides livelihood to millions of people but its production is becoming expensive because of high water consumption, use of expensive pesticides, insecticides and fertiliser. Genetically modified products aim to increase disease resistance and reduce the water required. The organic sector was worth $583 million. Genetically modified cotton, in 2007, occupied 43% of cotton growing areas.&lt;ref name="CRT"/&gt;

Before mechanisation, cotton was harvested manually by farmers in India and by African slaves in America. In 2012 [[Uzbekistan]] was a major exporter of cotton and uses manual labour during the harvest. Human rights groups claim that health care professionals and children are forced to pick cotton.&lt;ref name=bbc-usbek-cotton&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19931639 Doctors and nurses are forced to pick cotton]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing of other vegetable fibres==

===Flax===
{{main|Flax}}
Flax is a [[bast fibre]], which means it comes in bundles under the bark of the Linum usitatissimum plant. The plant flowers and is harvested.
:*[[Retting]]
:*Breaking
:*[[Scutching]]
:*[[Hackling]] or combing
It is now treated like cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jute===
{{main|Jute}}
Jute is a [[bast fibre]], which comes from the inner bark of the plants of the Corchorus genus. It is retted like flax, sundried and baled. When spinning a small amount of oil must be added to the fibre. It can be bleached and dyed. It was used for sacks and bags but is now used for the backing for carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jute can be blended with other fibres to make composite fabrics and work continues in Bangladesh to refine the processes and extend the range of usage possible. In the 1970s, jute-cotton composite fabrics were known as ''jutton'' fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2003/10/01/coverstory.htm Daily Star Magazine] 1 October 2003, accessed 20 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemp===
{{main|Hemp}}
Hemp is a [[bast fibre]] from the inner bark of Cannabis sativa. It is difficult to bleach, it is used for making cord and rope.
:*[[Retting]]
:*Separating
:*Pounding&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other bast fibres===
These bast fibres can also be used: [[kenaf]], [[urena]], [[ramie]], [[Urtica dioica|nettle]].

===Other leaf fibres===
[[Sisal]] is the main leaf fibre used; others are: [[abacá]] and [[henequen]].

==Processing of animal and insect fibres==

===Wool===
Wool comes from domesticated sheep. It forms two products, [[woolen]]s and [[worsted]]s. The sheep has two sorts of wool and it is the inner coat that is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been recovered from rags. [[Glossary of textile manufacturing|Shoddy]] is the term for recovered wool that is not matted, while [[Glossary of textile manufacturing|mungo]] comes from [[felt]]ed wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics.

The fleece is cut in one piece from the sheep.This is then skirted to remove the soiled wool, and baled. It is graded into long wool where the fibres can be up to 15 in, but anything over 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches is suitable for combing into worsteds. Fibres less than that form short wool and are described as clothing or carding wool.

At the mill the wool is scoured in a detergent to remove grease (the yolk) and impurities. This is done mechanically in the opening machine. Vegetable matter can be removed chemically using [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] (carbonising). Washing uses a solution of soap and [[sodium carbonate]]. The wool is oiled before carding or combing.
:*Woollens: Use noils from the worsted combs, mungo and shoddy and new short wool

:*Worsteds
:::[[Combing]]: Oiled slivers are wound into laps, and placed in the circular comber. The worsted yarn gathers together to form a top. The shorter fibres or noils remain behind and are removed with a knife.
:*[[Angora wool|Angora]]

===Silk===
The processes in [[silk]] production are similar to those of cotton but take account that reeled silk is a continuous fibre. The terms used are different.
*Opening bales. Assorting skeins: where silk is sorted by colour, size and quality, scouring: where the silk is washed in water of 40 degrees for 12 hours to remove the natural gum, drying: either by steam heating or centrifuge, softening: by rubbing to remove any remaining hard spots.
*Silk throwing (winding). The skeins are placed on a reel in a frame with many others. The silk is wound onto spools or bobbins.
:*Doubling and twisting. The silk is far too fine to be woven, so now it is doubled and twisted to make the warp, known as organzine and the weft, known as tram. In organzine each single is given a few twists per inch (tpi), and combine with several other singles counter twisted hard at 10 to 14 tpi. In tram the two singles are doubled with each other with a light twist, 3 to 6 tpi. Sewing thread is two tram threads, hard twisted, and machine-twist is made of three hard-twisted tram threads. Tram for the crepe process is twisted at up to 80 tpi to make it 'kick up'.
:*Stretching. The thread is tested for consistent size. Any uneven thickness is stretched out. The resulting thread is reeled into containing 500 yd to 2500 yd. The skeins are about 50 inches in loop length.
:*Dyeing: the skeins are scoured again, and discoloration removed with a sulphur process. This weakens the silk. The skeins are now tinted or dyed. They are dried and rewound onto bobbins, spools and skeins. Looming, and the weaving process on power looms is the same as with cotton.
*Weaving. The organzine is now warped. This is a similar process to in cotton. Firstly, thirty threads or so are wound onto a warping reel, and then using the warping reels, the threads are beamed. A thick layer of paper is laid between each layer on the beam to stop entangling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Silk manufacture|date=1900|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles04/textiles17.shtml|work=Antiques Digest: Lost Knowledge from the Past|publisher=Old and Sold|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental consequences of wool and silk manufacture===
Both wool and silk require [[farmland]]. Whereas silkworms require mulberry leaves, sheep eat grass, clover, forbs and other pasture plants. Sheep, like all ruminants emit CO2 via their digestive system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1113/expphysiol.1972.sp002136 MEASUREMENT OF CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION IN SHEEP BY ISOTOPE DILUTION.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, their pastures may sometimes be fertilised&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/pasture-management/use-nitrogen-fertiliser-boost-winter-pasture-growth?page=0%2C2 Use of nitrogen fertiliser to boost winter pasture growth]&lt;/ref&gt; which further increases emissions.

==Processing of synthetic fibres==

===Discussion of types of synthetic fibers===
{{main|Synthetic fiber}}
'''Synthetic fibers''' are the result of extensive development by [[scientist]]s to improve upon the naturally occurring [[animal]] and plant fibers. In general, [[synthetic fiber]]s are created by forcing, or [[extrusion|extruding]], fiber forming materials through holes (called spinnerets) into the air, thus forming a thread. Before synthetic fibers were developed, [[cellulose fiber]]s were made from natural [[cellulose]], which comes from [[plant]]s.

The first artificial fiber, known as [[art silk]] from 1799 onwards, became known as [[viscose]] around 1894, and finally [[rayon]] in 1924. A similar product known as [[cellulose acetate]] was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from [[wood]]. Although these artificial fibers were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, successful modern manufacture began much later in the 1930s. [[Nylon]], the first synthetic fiber, made its debut in the [[United States]] as a replacement for [[silk]], and was used for [[parachute]]s and other [[military]] uses. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The techniques used to process these fibers in yarn are essentially the same as with natural fibers, modifications have to be made as these fibers are of great length, and have no texture such as the scales in cotton and wool that aid meshing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Unlike natural fibres, produced by plants, animals or insects, synthetic fibres are made from [[fossil fuel]]s, and thus require no farmland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actforlibraries.org/do-synthetic-fabrics-harm-the-environment-no/ Do Synthetic Fabrics Harm the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Five Dysfunctions of a Team''''' is a business book by consultant and speaker [[Patrick Lencioni]] first published in 2002. It describes the many pitfalls that teams face as they seek to "grow together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Book Summary: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team|url = https://www.talentsquare.com/blog/book-summary-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/|website = www.talentsquare.com|access-date = 2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book explores the fundamental causes of [[Workplace politics|organizational politics]] and team failure. Like most of Lencioni's books, the bulk of it is written as a [[business fable]]. This book has appeared on American best-seller lists including: ''[[The New York Times Best Seller List]]'', ''[[Business Week]]'', ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.businessweek.com/@@2rq5NIYQUxYloBEA/magazine/content/04_06/b3869036_mz005.htm |title=The BusinessWeek Best-Seller List |date=January 30, 2004 |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808050217/http://www.businessweek.com/@@2rq5NIYQUxYloBEA/magazine/content/04_06/b3869036_mz005.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues it describes were considered especially important to team sports. The book's lessons were applied by several coaches to their teams in the [[National Football League]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/careers/Hot/11-28-05.htm|publisher=USA Today|author=Del Jones|date=November 28, 2005|title=Business leadership book wins fans in NFL – Several coaches apply 'Five Dysfunctions' to game play}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
According to the book, the five dysfunctions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Patrick Lencioni|title=The Five Dysfunctions of a Team|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AEIGAAAACAAJ|isbn=0-7879-6075-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Absence of trust—unwilling to be ''vulnerable'' within the group
* Fear of conflict—seeking ''artificial harmony'' over constructive passionate debate
* Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ''ambiguity'' throughout the organization
* Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets ''low standards''
* Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, ''status and ego'' before team success

== Criticism ==
Gordon Curphy and [[Robert Hogan (psychologist)|Robert Hogan]], both organizational [[psychologist]]s and leadership researchers, provide a critical perspective on Lencioni's team model in their book The Rocket Model: Practical Advice for Building High Performing Teams.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Model-Practical-Building-Performing/dp/0984096981|title=The Rocket Model: Practical Advice for Building High Performing Teams|last=Curphy|first=Gordon|last2=Hogan|first2=Robert|publisher=Hogan Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0984096985|location=USA|pages=19–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they clearly emphasize The Five Dysfunctions of a Team's contributions to the field they also point out major drawbacks of the model:

"Lencioni's model provides useful insights about team dynamics and has some advantages over the other models. The model is straightforward, identifies many of the reasons why teams fail, and offers practical advice on how to build high-functioning teams. Lencioni also deserves credit for pointing out the following: (1) the importance of the "first team"; (2) the need for leaders to teach teams how to win; (3) the recognition of time wasted avoiding conflict; and (4) cascading effect of leadership team dynamics. The simplicity of the Five Dysfunctions model, key insights, and 'touchy-feely' approach to team building make it popular among human resource professionals and team consultants. Nonetheless, Lencioni's book is explicitly a work of fiction; it is not based on research and its practical recommendations lack empirical support. For example, when the trust level among team members is low, Lencioni recommends that leaders put them through a series of personal disclosures and outdoor experiential exercises. However, there is little likelihood that these activities can build trust in dysfunctional work teams. It is more likely that leaders of low-trust teams will invite the members to a paint ball outing but be the only persons with guns. According to Katzenbach and Smith, the only effective method for teams to build trust and cohesion is to do real work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wisdom of Teams|last=Katzenbach|first=Jon|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=1994|isbn=|location=USA, Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meyrs-Briggs Type Indicator Step II (Form Q) Profile|last=Myers|first=K.|last2=Myers|first2=P.|publisher=Consulting Psychologists Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=USA, California, Palo Alto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the results do not constitute real work. Similar problems afflict the four other dysfunctions."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Transaction cost analysis''' ('''TCA'''), as used by institutional investors, is defined by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as "the study of trade prices to determine whether the trades were arranged at favourable prices – low prices for purchases and high prices for sales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=transaction-cost-analysis|title=Transaction Cost Analysis Definition from Financial Times Lexicon|website=lexicon.ft.com|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often split into two parts – pre-trade and post-trade. Recent regulations, such as the European [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive]], have required institutions to achieve best execution. This has resulted in the emergence of a number of companies who make TCA a central offering, such as [[Investment Technology Group]], [[Bloomberg_L.P.|Bloomberg]], [[Trade Informatics]], [[Markit]], and many others.

== Pre-trade ==
Pre-trade analysis is the process of taking known parameters of a planned trade and determining an execution strategy that will minimize the cost of transacting for a given level of acceptable risk. It is not possible to reduce both projected risk and cost past a certain [[efficient frontier]], since reducing risk tolerance requires limiting [[market exposure]] and thus trading faster. In this situation, [[market impact cost]] is much greater than for trades that accept greater risk and are executed more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Almgren, R. and N. Chriss (2000). Optimal execution of portfolio transactions. J. Risk 3 (2), 5–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on Financial Markets ===
[[Robert Almgren]] and [[Neil Chriss]] wrote their seminal paper on "Optimal execution of portfolio transactions", modelling the effect of transaction costs on the liquidation of an optimal portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Almgren]], [[Neil Chriss]], "Optimal execution of portfolio transactions" J. Risk, 3 (Winter 2000/2001) pp.5–39&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Almgren]] and [[Tianhui Li]] subsequently expanded this to a paper on "Option Hedging with Smooth Market Impact"&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|

}}&lt;/ref&gt;, extending the original analysis to derivative markets.

== Post-trade ==
The post-trade process involves first recording the data from previous trading periods, including trade timing, arrival price, average execution price, and relevant details about market movement. These data are then measured and compared to several benchmarks, such as the [[volume-weighted average price]], [[time-weighted average price]], [[participation-weighted average price]], or a variety of other measures. [[Implementation shortfall]] is a commonly targeted benchmark, which is the sum of all explicit and implicit costs. Sometimes, an opportunity cost of not transacting is factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/implementation-shortfall.asp|title=Implementation Shortfall Definition {{!}} Investopedia|last=root|date=2010-06-27|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After measurement, costs must be attributed to their underlying causes. Finally, this analysis is used to evaluate performance and monitor future transactions.

=== Record ===
Transaction cost analysis aims to improve trading at the level of individual decisions. This requires accurately recording the timing and content for every event in an order's life cycle. [[Financial Information eXchange]] (FIX) messages usually provide a consistent and highly accurate source of information for interactions between traders and brokers.

Data drawn from an [[order management system]] (OMS) or [[execution management system]] (EMS), however, are not as granular or as uniform as data from FIX, potentially leading to flawed conclusions unless significant effort is made to address this concern. All gaps must be filled in by supplementing FIX or OMS/EMS messages by communicating with brokers, traders, and portfolio managers.

=== Measure ===
A variety of measures and benchmarks are used in transaction cost analysis. The multitude of definitions for [[best execution]] and the dangers inherent in placing too much emphasis on a single statistic necessitate the ability to compare agents to a diverse set of benchmarks. These comparisons allow costs to be split into several categories, including [[explicit cost]], [[implicit cost]], [[delay cost]], and opportunity cost. The accurate measurement of each of these costs is necessary to facilitate decision management. For example, if the combination of explicit and implicit costs, which represent the realized cost of transacting, is greater than the opportunity cost of not transacting, it suggests that trades may have been executed too quickly. If the reverse is true, it suggests the need to execute more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Perold, André. "The Implementation Shortfall: Paper vs. Reality." ''Journal of Portfolio Management'' 14, no. 3 (spring 1988): 4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attribute ===
Reliable measurements allow decisions to be matched with observed outcomes. In the attribution phase, the four cost categories are broken down further, turning previously confusing statistics into intuitive measures representing specific aspects of a trade. For example, application of a [[transaction cost]] model helps split Implementation Shortfall into the parts resulting from the size of the order, [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]], or paying to cover the [[Bid-offer spread|spread]]. Proper attribution must also distinguish the influence of market factors (i.e. [[Sector (economy)|Sector]], [[Region]], [[Market capitalization]], and [[Momentum (finance)|Momentum]]) from that of human skill.

It is at this stage that problems that can arise if data is not supplemented with communication become clearly evident. For example, an incorrect determination of the time a trader gained control of an order could result in an unfair impact on the performance reported for that trader, when in reality the problem may have resulted from a delay between the portfolio manager and the desk.

=== Evaluate and monitor ===
The final stage of transaction cost analysis involves combining the results of the measurement and attribution to evaluate each agent. This is often done through periodic reports detailing important statistics as well as graphics to help visualize trends in the data. Transaction cost analysis providers will often include regular consulting to help draw conclusions from the data, establish goals to improve performance, and monitor future trading to determine the impact of any changes.

The '''Transnationality Index''' ('''TNI''') is a means of ranking [[multinational corporation]]s that is employed by economists and politicians.  It is calculated as the [[arithmetic mean]] of the following three [[ratio]]s (where "foreign" means outside of the corporation's home country):&lt;ref name=IB&gt;{{cite book|title=International Business|author=Stuart Wall and Bronwen Rees|pages=24|publisher=Pearson Education|date=2004|isbn=9780273685913}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the ratio of foreign assets to total assets
* the ratio of foreign sales to total sales
* the ratio of foreign employment to total employment

The Transnationality Index was developed by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041214130037/http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite_dir/docs/wir98br_gray2_en.pdf] ''The International Trade Journal'' August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|format=PDF|title=What do Internationalization Indices Measure?|publisher=Centre for International Business Studies, [[London South Bank University]]|author=Grazia Ietto-Gillies and Tannis Seccombe-Hett|date=1998-10-08|url=http://www.lsbu.ac.uk./cibs/pdf/6-97.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multinational corporations are also ranked by the amount of foreign assets that they own.  However, the TNI ranking can differ markedly from this.  For example, as of 2000, [[General Electric]] was the second largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign assert ownership.  However, it ranked only 73rd by the TNI, with an index of only 40%.  Although the company had large investments outside of the United States, most of its sales, employment, and assets were within the U.S..  In contrast, [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] has a TNI of 68% and [[Vodafone]] has a TNI of 81%.  As of 2001, General Electric ranked 75th, with a TNI of 36.7%.   The 14 most transnational corporations originated in small countries (Switzerland, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada), whereas the largest multinational corporations in terms of foreign asset ownership all had low TNI scores.  [[General Motors]], the fourth largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign asset ownership only ranked 83rd (30.7%) on the TNI top 100.  [[IBM]] ranked 50th (53.7%), [[Volkswagen]] ranked 45th (55.7%), and [[Toyota]], the sixth largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign asset ownership, only ranked 82nd (30.9%) on the broader TNI scale.&lt;ref name=IB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dicken /&gt;

Peter Dicken, an honorary fellow of the School of Environment and Development at the [[University of Manchester]], argues that TNI data refute the assertions of hyperglobalism.  The data, he argues, prove false the claim that multinational corporations are "inexorably, and inevitably, abandoning their ties to their country of origin".  If that were the case, we would expect the largest multinational corporations to have the majority of their assets, sales, and employmnent outside of their countries of origin, and thus the majority of those corporations to have high TNIs.  In fact, in the UNCTAD TNI data for the top 100 multinational corporations for 2001, the mean TNI is 52.6%, 57 of the 100 have a TNI greater than 50%, and only a mere 16 have a TNI greater than 75%.  Thus, he concludes, measured TNI data provide little evidence for multinational corporations having the proportions of their assets, sales, and employees outside of their home countries that one would expect for truly global firms.&lt;ref name=Dicken&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Shift|author=Peter Dicken|pages=221–224|publisher=SAGE|date=2003|isbn=9780761971504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''value grid''' model was proposed by Pil and Holweg as a means to show that the way firms compete has shifted away from the linear [[value chain]] way management theory has traditionally thought about value chain management.

The advantages of a value-grid framework, as opposed to value chains, is in allowing companies' managers to strategize and coordinate operations. Common non-linear value chain strategies include influencing demand, modifying information access, exploring [[multitier]] penetration, managing risk, seizing value, integrating value, creating new value propositions, exploiting value chains across tiers, pursuing pinch-point mapping, and defining demand enablers.
