      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2134">'''Adur Burzen-Mihr''' was an [[Atash Behram|Atash Bahram]] (a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[fire temple]] of the highest grade) located in [[Parthia (region)|Parthia]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] period it was one of the three [[Legendry Great Fires|Great Fires]] and was associated with the farmer class; the other two were [[Adur Farnbag]] in [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Persis]] which belong to the priest class, and [[Adur Gushnasp]] in [[Media (region)|Media]], which belong to the warrior class. Its establishment can be dated to the late 5th or early 4th century BC. ''Adur'' means "[[Atar|Holy Fire]]", and ''Burzēn-Mihr'' is a [[Parthian language|Parthian]] personal name literally meaning "Exalted is [[Mithra|Mihr]]", thought to be the name of the temple's founder. 

This Fire is described in ''[[Bundahishn]]''. Its location is given as [[Mount Rivand|Mount Rēvand]] (in Avestan: Raēvant), probably a spur of the [[Nishapur mountains]] in the district formerly known as [[Rēvand]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]]. An element of the name is preserved in the name of the nearby village [[Borzinan may]]. Another identification is Mount Mehr, five miles from the village [[Mehr, Razavi Khorasan|Mehr]] on the Shahrud&amp;ndash;Sabzevar Highway.

The Fire is mentioned several times in ''[[Shahnameh]]'' as Mehr-Barzīn (مهر برزین), Mehr (مهر), and Barzīn (برزین), and is used also as a [[simile]] for fiery fierceness.

The Fire is thought to have been a major center of pilgrimage, even after the [[Arsacids]]' fall. In the Sasanian period, although its name was always placed third in texts and the fire was associated with the lowliest class of the society, (farmers; the other two being warriors and priests), it still maintained its importance. Its history in the Islamic period is not known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1784">'''Aggavaṃsa''' of [[Arimaddana]] (modern [[Bagan]], [[Burma]]) was the author of the [[Saddanīti]], a [[grammar]] of the [[Pāli language]], specifically the text of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scriptures, the [[Tipiṭaka]].  The work was completed in 1154, CE and was taken to Laṅka (Ceylon) a few years after its completion.

It can be seen as a descriptive grammatical work. It consists of 28 chapters with the first 19 being entitled ''Mahāsaddanīti'' (The Greater Guidance of Sadda) and the remaining 9 chapters being called ''Cullasaddanīti'' (The Lesser Guidance of Sadda).The Mahāsaddanīti is in two sections: the Padamālā(1-14)that deals with  morphological and syntactic patterns of Pāli and the Dhātumālā(1-14)that gives a full lexicografical account of Pāli roots in eight gaṇas.
The Cullasaddanīti is tantamount to the Suttamālā. It is made up of 1347 suttas accompanying an additional chapter on upasaggas and nipātas .

'''''Pangistu'''''.&lt;ref name="UNHCR" /&gt;}} is an official cover term for various, partly [[Syncretism|syncretic]] forms of [[mysticism]] in [[Indonesia]].{{sfn|Caldarola|1982|p=539, note 30}} It includes ''[[kebatinan]]'', ''kejiwan'', and ''kerohanian''.{{sfn|Caldarola|1982|p=539, note 30}}

==Characteristics==
[[Kebatinan]] can be described as an amalgam of [[animist]], [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]], and [[Islamic]] (especially [[Sufi]]) mystical elements that combine to form Javanese mysticism. According to Caldarola, kepercayaan "is not an apt characterization of what the mystical groups have in common".{{sfn|Caldarola|1982|p=539, note 30}} The [[US State Department|US State Department's]] states:
{{quote|Sizeable populations in [[Java]], [[Kalimantan]], and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]] practice [[animism]] and other types of traditional belief systems termed "Aliran Kepercayaan." Many of those who practice Kepercayaan describe it as more of a [[meditation]]-based spiritual path than a [[religion]]. Some animists combine their beliefs with one of the government-recognized religions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51512.htm "International Religious Freedom Report 2005 (Indonesia)"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Recognition==
As a body of belief, kebatinan is officially recognized in the 1945 [[Indonesia]]n constitution; however, to avoid recognizing it as a formal religion, it is administered by the [[Indonesian Department of Education and Culture|Department of Education and Culture]] rather than by the [[Indonesian Department of Religious Affairs|Department of Religious Affairs]]. The Indonesian Government recognizes the right to follow Aliran Kepercayaan, as long as its practitioners do not upset the public order or offend the sensitivities of the followers of the major religions.

Aliran Kepercayaan has recently{{when|date=April 2013}} been rejected by the [[United Development Party]] [PPP] heterodoxy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Indonesia's Constitutional Court on Nov 2017 ruled that followers of faiths outside the 6 recognized are allowed to state so on their national identity cards, as a 7th category ''aliran kepercayaan'' including [[Marapu]] religion, the [[Parmalim]] followers of ''Ugamo Bangsa Batak'' religion, and [[:id:Sapta Darma]], something that has never happened in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;http://jakartaglobe.id/news/indonesias-constitutional-court-says-yes-indigenous-faiths/&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, it is unclear if Papuan religions are recognized at this point.

==Etymology==
The root of the word ''Ashura'' has the meaning of ''tenth'' in [[Semitic languages]]; hence the name of the remembrance, literally translated, means "the tenth day". According to the orientalist A.{{nbsp}}J. Wensinck, the name is derived from the Hebrew ʿāsōr, with the Aramaic determinative ending.&lt;ref&gt;A.{{nbsp}}J. Wensinck, "Āshūrā", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam{{nbsp}}2''. Retrieved June 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The day is indeed the tenth day of the month, although some Islamic scholars offer up different etymologies. In his book ''Ghuniyatut Talibin'', [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani|Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani]] writes that Islamic scholars differ as to why this day is known as Ashura, some of them suggesting that it is the tenth most important day with which God has blessed Muslims.&lt;ref name="wordsimilarity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Top 10 similar words or synonyms for ashura|url=http://wordsimilarity.com/en/ashura|website=wordsimilarity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
{{Main article|Battle of Karbala}}
The Battle of Karbala took place within the crisis environment resulting from the succession of [[Yazid I]].&lt;ref name="EI-Yazid"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=G.R.|first=Hawting|title=Yazīd (I) b. Muʿāwiya|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Brill|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_8000|edition=second|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hitti|first1=Philip K.|title=The Near East In History A 5000 Year Story|publisher=Literary Licensing, LLC|isbn=1258452456|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oOM2PH3IYrMC&amp;q=yazid+succession&amp;dq=yazid+succession|accessdate=September 23, 2016|language=en|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after succession, Yazid instructed the governor of [[Medina]] to compel Husayn and a few other prominent figures to pledge their allegiance ([[Bay'ah]]).&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; Husayn, however, refrained from making such a pledge, believing that Yazid was openly going against the teachings of Islam and changing the [[sunnah]] of Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref name="alsunnah.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsunnah.ca/yazid.html |title=Al Bidayah wa al-Nihayah |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsunnah.ca/yazid.html |title=Al-Sawa'iq al-Muhriqah |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He, therefore, accompanied by his household, his sons, brothers, and the sons of [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] left Medina to seek asylum in [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

On the other hand, the people in [[Kufa]], when informed of Muawiyah's death, sent letters urging Husayn to join them and pledging to support him against the [[Umayyads]]. Husayn wrote back to them saying that he would send his cousin [[Muslim ibn Aqeel]] to report to him on the situation, and that, if he found them supporter as their letters indicated, he would speedily join them because an [[Imam]] should act in accordance with the [[Quran]] and uphold justice, proclaim the truth, and dedicate himself to the cause of God. The mission of Muslim was initially successful and according to reports, 18,000 men pledged their allegiance. But the situation changed radically when Yazid appointed [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]] as the new governor of Kufa, ordering him to deal severely with Ibn Aqeel. Before news of the adverse turn of events had reached Mecca, Husayn set out for Kufa.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

On the way, Husayn found that his messenger, Muslim ibn Aqeel, had been killed in Kufa. Husayn encountered the army of [[Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad]] along the route towards Kufa. Husayn addressed the Kufan army, reminding them that they had invited him to come because they were without an Imam. He told them that he intended to proceed to Kufa with their support, but if they were now opposed to his coming, he would return to where he had come from. In response, the army urged him to proceed by another route. Thus, he turned to the left and reached [[Karbala]], where the army forced him not to go further and stop at a location that was without water.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

[[File:20131203 Istanbul 012.jpg|thumb|260px|Name of the Karbala [[Martyrdom|Martyr]] ''Husayn with [[Islamic calligraphy]]'' in [[Hagia Sophia]]]]
Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad, the governor instructed [[Umar ibn Sa'ad]], the head of the Kufan army, to offer Ḥusayn and his supporters the opportunity to swear allegiance to Yazid. He also ordered Umar ibn Sa'ad to cut off Husayn and his followers from access to the water of the Euphrates.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt; On the next morning, Umar ibn Sa'ad arranged the Kufan army in battle order.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

The [[Battle of Karbala]] lasted from morning to sunset on October 10, 680 (Muharram{{nbsp}}10, 61{{nbsp}}AH).

Once the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] troops had murdered Husayn and his male followers, they looted the tents, stripped the women of their jewelry, and took the skin upon which [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Zain al-Abidin]] was prostrate.

==Commemoration of the death of Husayn ibn Ali==

[[Image:Kerbela Hussein Moschee.jpg|thumb|Millions of Shia Muslims gather around the Husayn Mosque in Karbala after making the pilgrimage on foot during [[Arba'een]], which is a Shia religious observation that occurs 40 days after the Day of Ashura.]]

===History of the commemoration by Shia===
According to [[Ignác Goldziher]],

{{quote|[E]ver since the black day of Karbala, the history of this family … has been a continuous series of sufferings and persecutions. These are narrated in poetry and prose, in a richly cultivated literature of martyrologies …'More touching than the tears of the Shi'is' has even become an Arabic proverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldziher|first1=Ignác|title=Introduction to Islamic Theology and Law|date=1981|location=Princeton|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first assembly (''majlis'') of the Commemoration of Husayn ibn Ali is said to have been held by Zaynab in prison. In Damascus, too, she is reported to have delivered a poignant oration. The prison sentence ended when Husayn's 3-year-old daughter, [[Sakina bint Husayn|Sakina]], died in captivity. She would often cry in prison to be allowed to see her father. She is believed to have died when she saw her father's mutilated head. Her death caused an uproar in the city, and Yazid, fearing a potential uprising, freed the captives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Zaynab Bint Ali | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion | accessdate=January 19, 2008|url=http://www.bookrags.com/Zaynab_bint_Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Zayn Al Abidin]] said the following:

{{quote|It is said that for twenty years whenever food was placed before him, he would weep. One day a servant said to him, 'O son of Allah's Messenger! Is it not time for your sorrow to come to an end?' He replied, 'Woe upon you! [[Jacob]] the prophet had [[Tribes of Israel|twelve sons]], and Allah made [[Benjamin|one of them]] disappear. His eyes turned white from constant weeping, his head turned grey out of sorrow, and his back became bent in gloom,{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#12:84 Quran, 12:84]}} though his son was alive in this world.

Husayn's grave became a pilgrimage site among Shia Muslims only a few years after his death. A tradition quickly developed of pilgrimage to the [[Imam Husayn Shrine]] and the other Karbala martyrs, known as ''[[Ziarat ashura]]''.&lt;ref name="Popular Shiism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Hosayn B.

Public rites of remembrance for Husayn's martyrdom developed from the early pilgrimages.&lt;ref name="Nafasul Mahmoom"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nafasul Mahmoom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv3dBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|publisher=JAC Developer|pages=12–|id=GGKEY:RQAZ12CNGF5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Buyid dynasty, [[Mu'izz ad-Dawla]] officiated at public commemoration of Ashura in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name= Chelkowski &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chelkowski|first1=Peter|title=Shia Muslim Processional Performances|journal=The Drama Review: TDR|date=January 1, 1985|volume=29|issue=3|pages=18–30|doi=10.2307/1145650|jstor=1145650|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These commemorations were also encouraged in Egypt by the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Abu Mansoor Nizar al-Aziz Billah|al-'Aziz]].&lt;ref name="Blank"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blank|first1=Jonah|title=Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity Among the Daudi Bohras|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226056777|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_FExBRnC3YC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=Egypt+by+the+Fatimid+caliph+al-%27Aziz,+Ashura&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6svNcQK9zv&amp;sig=5k-1JVeLpNJcJAJGLPszWbByMwc&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnturjnMDWAhUMYVAKHXSLDfMQ6AEIZjAN#v=onepage&amp;q=Egypt%20by%20the%20Fatimid%20caliph%20al-'Aziz%2C%20Ashura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the recognition of [[Twelvers]] as the official religion by the [[Safavids]], [[Mourning of Muharram]] extended throughout the first ten days of [[Muharram]].&lt;ref name="Popular Shiism" /&gt;

=== Azadari (mourning) rituals ===

The words ''Azadari'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: عزاداری) which mean mourning and lamentation; and Majalis-e Aza have been exclusively used in connection with the remembrance ceremonies for the martyrdom of Imam Hussain. Majalis-e Aza, also known as Aza-e Husayn, includes mourning congregations, lamentations, [[Mätam|matam]] and all such actions which express the emotions of grief and above all, repulsion against what [[Yazid I|Yazid]] stood for.&lt;ref name="Calmard 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jean|first1=Calmard|title=AZĀDĀRĪ|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azadari|website=iranicaonline|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gesel voor Ashura ritueel - Stichting Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen - TM-4182-17.jpg|thumb|Ritual scourge for use in the Ashura procession. Syria, before 1974.]]

These religious customs show solidarity with Husayn and his family. Through them, people mourn Husayn's death and express regret for the fact that they were not present at the battle to fight and save Husayn and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4620487.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=Devout Muslim guilty of making boys beat themselves during Shia ceremony | first=Steve | last=Bird | date=August 28, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/08/27/55577.html |title=British Muslim convicted over teen floggings |publisher=Alarabiya.net |date=August 27, 2008 |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost 12 centuries, five types of major rituals were developed around the [[battle of Karbala]]. These rituals include the memorial services (''majalis al-ta'ziya''), the visitation of Husayn's tomb in Karbala particularly on the occasion of the tenth day of Ashura and the fortieth day after the battle (Ziyarat Ashura and ziyarat al-Arba'in), the public mourning processions (al-mawakib al-husayniyya or the representation of the battle of Karbala in the form of a play (the shabih), and the flagellation (tatbir).&lt;ref name="Nakash"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakash|first1=Yitzhak|title=An Attempt To Trace the Origin of the Rituals of Āshurā¸|journal=Die Welt des Islams|date=January 1, 1993|volume=33|issue=2|pages=161–81|doi=10.1163/157006093X00063|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/157006093x00063|accessdate=July 17, 2016}}{{subscription required|via=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Shia Muslims believe that taking part in Ashura washes away their sins.&lt;ref&gt;David Pinault, "Shia Lamentation Rituals and Reinterpretations of the Doctrine of Intercession: Two Cases from Modern India," History of Religions 38 no.{{nbsp}}3 (1999): 285–305.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular Shia saying has it that "a single tear shed for Husayn washes away a hundred sins".&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Vali, "The Shia Revival", Norton, 2006, p.{{nbsp}}50&lt;/ref&gt;

For Shia Muslims, the commemoration of Ashura is not a festival but rather a sad event, while Sunni Muslims view it as a victory God gave to Moses. For Shia Muslims, it is a period of intense grief and mourning. Mourners congregate at a mosque for sorrowful, poetic recitations such as ''[[marsiya]]'', ''[[noha]]'', ''[[latmiya]]'', and ''[[soaz]]'' performed in memory of the martyrdom of Husayn, lamenting and grieving to the tune of beating drums and chants of "[[Ya Hussain]]". Also, [[Ulama]]s give sermons with themes of Husayn's personality and position in Islam, and the history of his uprising. The Sheikh of the mosque retells the Battle of Karbala to allow his listeners to relive the pain and sorrow endured by Husayn and his family and they read [[Maqtal Al-Husayn]]&lt;ref name="Nakash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puchowski|first1=Douglas|title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 2|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415994040|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a90rBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1053#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Certain traditional [[flagellation]] rituals such as [[Tatbir|Talwar zani]] (''talwar ka matam'' or sometimes ''tatbir'') use a sword.

On the 10th of the month of [[Muharrem]]{{snd}}The [[Ashure]] Day{{snd}}[[Huseyn bin Ali]] was murdered at [[Karbala]]&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Alevis mourn on this day to commemorate the death of Huseyn bin Ali at [[Kerbala]] in [[Irak]].&lt;/ref&gt; Remembrance by [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]]s, [[Qizilbash]] [[Alevi]]-[[Turkish people|Turks]], and [[Bektashi]]s together in [[Ottoman Empire]]

This day is of particular significance to [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Alawites]], who consider Husayn (the grandson of Prophet Muhammad) [[Ahl al-Bayt]], the third Imam to be the rightful successor of Prophet Muhammad.

According to Kamran Scot Aghaie, "The symbols and rituals of Ashura have evolved over time and have meant different things to different people. However, at the core of the symbolism of Ashura is the moral dichotomy between worldly injustice and corruption on the one hand and God-centered justice, piety, sacrifice and perseverance on the other. Also, [[Shiite]] Muslims consider the remembrance of the tragic events of Ashura to be an important way of worshipping God in a spiritual or mystical way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornell|first1=Vincent J.|author2=Kamran Scot Aghaie|title=Voices of Islam|date=2007|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CN|isbn=978-0275987329|pages=111–12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_eGWvPTtikC&amp;dq=Karbala+Umayyads|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shia Muslims make pilgrimages on Ashura, as they do forty days later on Arba'een, to the Mashhad al-Husayn, the [[shrine]] in Karbala, Iraq, that is traditionally held to be Husayn's tomb. On this day Shia is in remembrance, and mourning attire is worn. They refrain from listening to or playing music since Arabic culture generally considers music impolite during death rituals. It is a time for sorrow and for showing respect for the person's passing, and it is also a time for self-reflection when one commits oneself completely to the mourning of Husayn. Shia Muslims do not plan weddings and parties on this date. They mourn by crying and listening to recollections of the tragedy and sermons on how Husayn and his family were martyred. This is intended to connect them with Husayn's suffering and [[martyrdom]], and the sacrifices he made to keep Islam alive. Husayn's martyrdom is widely interpreted by Shia Muslims a symbol of the struggle against injustice, tyranny, and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/paradigm-akhtar.htm |title=Karbala', an Enduring Paradigm |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shia Muslims  believe the Battle of Karbala was between the forces of good and evil, with Husayn representing good and Yazid representing evil.&lt;ref name="Dabashi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dabashi|first1=Hamid|title=Islamic Liberation Theology: Resisting the Empire|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415771559|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9WTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=Battle+of+Karbala+was+between+the+forces+of+good+and+evil,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k_r-CGZ3Of&amp;sig=9mJPpCeg8r14Mod1YnJjIOR8cRM&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia-r7Nn8DWAhVCPVAKHdgyAaEQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Battle%20of%20Karbala%20was%20between%20the%20forces%20of%20good%20and%20evil%2C&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shia Imams]] strongly insist that the day of Ashura should not be celebrated as a day of joy and festivity. The day of Ashura, according to [[Twelve Imams|Eighth Shia Imam]] [[Ali al-Rida]], must be observed as a day of rest, sorrow, and total disregard of worldly matters.&lt;ref&gt;Ayoub, Shiʻism (1988), pp.{{nbsp}}258&amp;ndash;59&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the events associated with Ashura are held in special congregation halls known as "[[Imambargah]]" and [[Hussainia]].&lt;ref name="Campo2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Eduardo Campo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA318|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438126968|pages=318–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunni Islam===
Sunnis regard fasting during Ashura as recommended, though not obligatory, having been superseded by the [[Ramadan]] fast. [[Sahih Muslim]], (Hadith-2499)&lt;ref name =Sivan&gt;Emmanuel Sivan. "Sunni Radicalism in the Middle East and the Iranian Revolution". ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol.{{nbsp}}21, No.{{nbsp}}1. (February 1989), pp.{{nbsp}}1–30&lt;/ref&gt; According to hadith record in [[Sahih Bukhari]], Ashura was already known as a commemorative day during which some Makkah residents used to observe customary fasting. Prophet Muhammad fasted on the day of Ashura, 10th Muharram, in Makkah. When fasting during the month of Ramadan became obligatory, the fast of Ashura was made non-compulsory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Fast"/&gt;

=== Judaism ===
According to Muslim tradition, the Jews also fasted on the tenth day. According to [[Sunnah|Sunni Muslim tradition]], [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] narrates that Prophet Muhammad came to [[Medina]] and saw the Jews fasting on the tenth day of Muharram. He asked, "What is this?" They said, "This is a good day, this is the day when Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemy and Musa ([[Moses]]) [[Yom Kippur|fasted on this day]]." He said, "We have more claim over Musa than you." So he fasted on the day and told the people to fast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Fast"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, John Andrew. ''Islamic Images and Ideas: Essays on Sacred Symbolism''. McFarland &amp; Co, 2013. pp.{{nbsp}}234–36. {{ISBN|978-0786458486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Marion Holmes ''The Birth of The Prophet Muhammad: Devotional Piety in Sunni Islam''. Routledge, 2007. pp.{{nbsp}}113–15. {{ISBN|978-1135983949}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This tenth in question is believed to be the tenth of the Jewish month of [[Tishri]], which is [[Yom Kippur]] in Judaism.&lt;ref name="Islam, Francis E. 1994, p.{{nbsp}}204"&gt;Prophet Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, Francis E. Peters, SUNY Press, 1994, p.{{nbsp}}204.&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah designates the tenth day of the seventh month as holy and a fast (Lev.{{nbsp}}16, Lev.{{nbsp}}23, Num.{{nbsp}}29). The word "tenth" in Hebrew is ''Asarah'' or ''Asharah'' ({{Hebrew|עשרה}}), which is from the same Semitic root A-SH-R. According to this tradition, Prophet Muhammad continued to observe the veneration of Ashura modeled on its Jewish prototype in late September until shortly before his death, which the verse of [[Nasi']] was revealed and the Jewish-type calendar adjustments of the Muslims became prohibited. From then on, Ashura became distinct from its Jewish predecessor of Yom Kippur.&lt;ref name="Islam, Francis E 1994, p. 204"&gt;Prophet Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, Francis E. Peters, SUNY Press, 1994, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A tadjah at Hosay.jpg|thumb|A tadjah at Hosay in [[Port of Spain]] during the 1950s]]

==Socio-political aspects==
[[File:Sham Ghariban in Imam Reza shrine, Mashhad 13950721 03.jpg|thumb|right|Sham Ghariban ''(the first night in mourn of Husayn)'' in [[Imam Reza Shrine]], [[Mashhad]], Iran]]
Commemoration of Ashura has great socio-political value for the Shia, who have been a minority throughout their history. According to the prevailing conditions at the time of the commemoration, such reminiscences may become a framework for implicit dissent or explicit protest. It was, for instance, used during the [[Islamic Revolution of Iran]], the [[Lebanese Civil War]], the Lebanese resistance against the [[Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israeli military presence]] and in the [[1990s Uprising in Bahrain]]. Sometimes the Ashura commemorations associate the memory of Al-Husayn's martyrdom with the conditions of Islam and Muslims in reference to Husayn's [[Live like Ali, die like Hussein|famous quote]] on the day of Ashura: "Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/English/ArtCulture/2004/03/article06.shtml IslamOnline – Art &amp; Entertainment Section] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211012221/http://www.islamonline.net/English/ArtCulture/2004/03/article06.shtml |date=December 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the period of the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] (1905–1911) onward, mourning gatherings increasingly assumed a political aspect. Following an old established tradition, preachers compared the oppressors of the time with Imam Husayn's enemies, the [[umayyads]].&lt;ref name="Azadari"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Calmard |first=J. | title='AZAÚDAÚRÈ | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica | accessdate=December 16, 2010|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f2/v3f2a063.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504011659/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f2/v3f2a063.html|archivedate=May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political function of commemoration was very marked in the years leading up to the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1978–79, as well as during the revolution itself. In addition, the implicit self-identification of the Muslim revolutionaries with Imam Husayn led to a blossoming of the cult of the martyr, expressed most vividly, perhaps, in the vast cemetery of [[Behesht-e Zahra]], to the south of [[Tehran]], where the martyrs of the revolution and the war against Iraq are buried.&lt;ref name="Azadari" /&gt;

On the other hand, some governments have banned this commemoration. In the 1930s [[Reza Shah]] forbade it in Iran. The regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] saw this as a potential threat and banned Ashura commemorations for many years.&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melton |first1=J.

==In the Gregorian calendar==
{{Main article|Islamic calendar}}

While Ashura is always on the same day of the Islamic calendar, the date on the [[Gregorian calendar]] varies from year to year due to differences between the two calendars, since the Islamic calendar is a [[lunar calendar]] and the Gregorian calendar is a [[solar calendar]]. Furthermore, the appearance of the crescent moon that is used to determine when each Islamic month begins varies from country to country due to the different geographic locations.

==Ashura in Chicago, United States==
Every year on 10th Muharram hundreds take part in procession downtown for Muslim holiday of mourning. Many from Chicago’s Islamic communities donning black garb as a sign of mourning, turn out each year for the anniversary. The message of Ashura is universal and It is about standing up for what is right. At the Loop police blocked off streets for the procession of Ashura, which began and ended at the Thompson Center. Mosque leaders sang poems of mourning, and others carried colorful flags and banners, some bearing the names of those who died alongside Hussein.

Many Muslims took off school for the holiday, as did many others marching down Randolph Street. After the yearly procession, many families go to pray at a mosque or gather at houses, where they often pray and reflect. Over the years, Chicagoans have dealt with all sorts of weather for the procession because the Islamic calendar, based on a lunar system, shifts relative to the standard Julian calendar

==Description==
In the 15th ("Emerging from the Earth") chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the vast number of bodhisattvas from other realms who had appeared to hear Shakyamuni preach in the "Ceremony in the Air" hoped to receive the Buddha's permission to be the ones to propagate the Dharma in the perilous era to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murano|first1=Senchu|title=An Outline of the Lotus Sūtra|journal=Contemporary Religions in Japan|date=1967|volume=8|issue=1|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="Skt version"|Chapter 15 in Kumarajivas translation corresponds to chapter 14 ("Issuing of Bodhisattvas from the Gaps of the Earth") in the extant Sanskrit versions.&lt;ref name=Pye&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pye|first1=Michael|title=Skilful Means - A concept in Mahayana Buddhism|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=173|ISBN=0203503791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kern|first1=Hendrik |title=Saddharma Pundarîka or the Lotus of the True Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XXI, Oxford|pages=281–297|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/lotus/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  To their great chagrin, Shakyamuni refused their request, deferring this honor to unnamed bodhisattvas who already existed in the empty space underneath the ''sahā-world'' [tr: "world of endurance of suffering, any world of transmigration"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soothill|first1=W.E.|authorlink1=William Edward Soothill|last2=Hodous|first2=Lewis|authorlink2=Lewis Hodous|title=A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms|year=1937|publisher=London: Trübner|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Suguro|first=Shinjo|last2=Nichiren Buddhist International Center|first2=trans.|title=Introduction to the Lotus Sutra|url=|year=1998|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|isbn=0875730787|pages=123-124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right after he made this statement the earth shook and a mighty fissure appeared.  Dramatically, and in a single instant, bodhisattvas whose numbers are described in the sutra as "immeasurable, boundless, beyond anything that can be known through calculation, simile or parable" arose from the earth.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Burton, trans.|title=The Lotus sutra and its opening and closing sutras|date=2009|publisher=Soka Gakkai|location=Tokyo|isbn=978-4-412-01409-1|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of them are "golden in hue, with the thirty-two features [of the Buddha] and an immeasurable brightness."&lt;ref&gt;Watson (2009), p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

These bodhisattvas had four leaders and guiding teachers: [[Visistacaritra|Superior Practices]] (the leader of the four), Boundless Practices, [[Visuddhacaritra|Pure Practices]], and [[Supratisthitacaritra|Firmly Established Practices]].&lt;ref name="The English Buddhist Dictionary Committee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murano|first1=Senchu|title=An Outline of the Lotus Sūtra|journal=Contemporary Religions in Japan|date=1967|volume=8|issue=1|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four leaders have been interpreted to represent the four [[bodhisattva vow]]s as practiced by the Mahayana traditions of China, Japan, and Korea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niwano|first1=Nikkyo|title=Buddhism for today: a modern interpretation of the threefold lotus sutra|date=1975|publisher=Weatherhill|location=New York|isbn=9780834801479|edition=1st English|url=http://www.rk-world.org/publications/buddhismfortoday_B15.aspx|quote=1.

==Interpretations==
According to [[Tao Sheng]] (ca. 360–434), the splitting of the earth and the welling forth of the bodhisattvas is indicative that "living beings inherently possess an endowment for enlightenment, and it cannot remain concealed; they are bound to break the earth of defilements and emerge to safeguard the Dharma.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Young-ho|title=Tao-sheng's commentary on the Lotus Sūtra : a study and translation|date=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0791402274|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegory of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth in the 15th-21st chapters of the Lotus Sutra has affected the outlooks and practices of numerous Buddhist schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leighton|first1=Taigen Dan|title=Vision of Awakening Space and Time Dogen and the Lotus Sutra.|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199724277|pages=41–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although interpretations vary school by school, [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] provides a generalized reference:  by rejecting the entreaties of bodhisattvas from other realms of the universe to propagate the Lotus Sutra after his death and by summoning countless bodhisattvas from under the earth, the Buddha affirms that he is from the world and the people of the world can rise to be its caretakers.  In addition, he thus affirms the infinite universality of his life and the lives of all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanh|first1=Thich Nhat|title=Peaceful action, open heart : lessons from the Lotus Sutra|date=2009|publisher=Parallax Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=9781888375930|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The welling forth of innumerable bodhisattvas from the earth has also been used as a metaphor for the emergence of a grassroots Buddhist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moon|first1=Susan|title=Not turning away : the practice of engaged Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=9781590301036|page=160|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metaphor of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth is also being used in secular and ecumenical writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaChance|first1=Albert J.|title=The architecture of the soul : a unitive model of the human person|date=2006|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=1556436025|pages=210–211|quote=We urgently need Bodhisattvas of the Earth from every creed--Jews, Christians, Moslems, Wiccans, Buddhists, Hindus, atheists, humanists, whatever.

===Interpretation in Nichiren Buddhism===
Whereas [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhists]] regard the first fourteen chapters as the transient or theoretical "Imprinted Gate," the "Emerging from the Earth" chapter (ch 15) is regarded as the opening of the Lotus Sutra's essential teachings (chapters 15-28), or the "Original Gate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tanabe|first1=George J.

He claimed to qualify for this designation as the one who first grasped and taught the Mystic Law of [[Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]] in the Latter Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leighton|first1=Taigen Dan|title=Vision of Awakening Space and Time Dogen and the Lotus Sutra.|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199724277|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four leaders of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth are represented on the top row of the [[Gohonzon]], the calligraphic mandala inscribed by [[Nichiren]], flanking the characters for Shakyamuni and Taho (Many Treasures) Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nichiren-shu.org/boston/pages/Honzon/bodhisattva.htm|website=Nichiren-Shu.org|title=Honzon|publisher=Nichiren-shu|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letter "The True Aspect of All Phenomena," Nichiren clearly stated that followers of his who spread and promote his teachings are fellow Bodhisattvas of the Earth: "There should be no discrimination among those who propagate the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo in the Latter Day of the Law, be they men or women. Were they not Bodhisattvas of the Earth,  they could not chant the daimoku. At first only Nichiren chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but then two, three, and a hundred followed, chanting and teaching others. Propagation will unfold this way in the future as well. Does this not signify 'emerging from the earth'?"&lt;ref&gt;Nichiren Daishonin, Soka Gakkai International (ed) (1999). The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, Vol-1, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of the appearance of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth is underscored in most Nichiren schools: [[Soka Gakkai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ikeda|first1=Daisaku|title=The heritage of the ultimate law of life|date=2009|publisher=World Tribune Press|location=Santa Monica, Calif.|isbn=9781938252280|pages=29, 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nichiren Shū]], and [[Nichiren Shoshu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodhisattvas of the Earth|url=http://www.nst.org/articles/bodhisattvas-of-the-earth/|website=Nichiren Shoshu Temple|publisher=NST|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differing interpretations of how the Bodhisattvas of the Earth correspond to contemporary people are described below:

====Nichiren Shu====
Nichiren Shu states that its members aspire to the status of Bodhisattvas of the Earth.&lt;ref name="pbnshi.or.id"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First International Lay Retreat ‘Determined to Be Bodhisattvas of the Earth’|url=http://www.nichiren-shu.org/newsletter/nichirenshu_news/NichirenSN175.pdf|website=Nichiren Shu News|publisher=Published by the Head Office of Nichiren-shu Buddhism &amp; NOPPA|date=Dec 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soka Gakkai====
The Soka Gakkai holds that all people who propagate the ideals of the Lotus Sutra are Bodhisattvas of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ikeda|first1=Daisaku|title=The Heart of the Lotus Sutra: The Mahayana Classic from Theory to Practice|date=2001|publisher=Middleway Press|isbn=0967469759|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kH87BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=bodhisattvas+of+the+earth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIzdzjrf_vxgIViG0eCh2IPwlZ#v=onepage&amp;q=bodhisattvas%20of%20the%20earth&amp;f=false|quote=All those who spread Buddhism in the defiled world of the Latter Day of the Law are, without exception, Bodhisattvas of the Earth.

====Nichiren Shoshu====
Nichiren Shoshu refers to its believers as "associates of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth," "sharing karmic bonds with the Bodhisattvas of the Earth,"  or as "followers of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth." There are occasional references to the laity and priests of Nichiren Shoshu being the Bodhisattvas of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shogu|first1=Kimura|title=Upholding Faith and Practice with a Solid Vow|url=http://www.nichirenshoshumyoshinji.org/sermons/2010/06_10_oko.php|website=Nichiren Shoshu Myoshinji Temple|publisher=Nichiren Shoshu Temple|accessdate=24 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724071649/http://www.nichirenshoshumyoshinji.org/sermons/2010/06_10_oko.php#|archive-date=2015-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodhisattvas of the Earth|url=http://www.nst.org/articles/bodhisattvas-of-the-earth/|website=Nichiren Shoshu Temple|publisher=Nichiren Shoshu Temple|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shonin|first1=Nichinyo|title=Guidance from Sixty-eighth High Priest Nichinyo Shonin: On the Occasion of the  June Kosen-rufu Shodai Ceremony June 2, 2013|url=http://www.nstny.org/Documents/Myosetsuji News Sept_13.pdf|website=Nichiren Shoshu Temple of New York|publisher=Nichiren Shoshu Temple of New York|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation in Lotus Sutra Schools===
According to the [[Risshō Kōsei Kai]], the appearance of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth represent a shift from teachings of theory in the first half of the Lotus Sutra to teachings about conduct and human action, teachings that are applicable to life today.{{refn|group=note|name="first half of the Lotus Sutra"|Nikkyō Niwano: "The first half of the Lotus Sutra was given over largely to the teaching of reason and truth, the teaching of wisdom. But upon completion of that half of the sutra, we had the abrupt appearance of a countless throng of bodhisattvas who were doers. Any teaching without application in practice, in conduct, is nothing. It must move on to the stage of action. True bodhisattvas are the doers who apply their knowledge of the true aspect of all reality, the statement of which truth is the theme of the first half of the Lotus Sutra. They are the doers who, in their compassionate conduct, exemplify the truth of the buddha-nature identity: the kind of persons who make the teaching of the Buddha meaningful in this world. Since this so precisely applies to us who are alive today, it is important to take the message to heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niwano|first1=Nikkyō|title=A guide to the Threefold Lotus Sutra|date=1982|publisher=Kosei Publ. Co.|location=Tokyo|isbn=978-4333010257|edition=2. print.|url=http://www.rk-world.org/publications/guidels_B15.aspx|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Reeves suggests that the massive emergence of the Bodhisattvas from the Earth, born from the ground of daily life, is an ongoing process, not a one-time story.{{refn|group=note|name="the power to see the buddha in others"|Reeves: "The text says that the four groups, the monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, could see these bodhisattvas "by the divine powers of the Buddha."  This is another way of referring to the human imagination, to the power that we all have to transcend everyday life, the power to see the buddha in others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Gene|title=The stories of the Lotus sutra|date=2010|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Boston|isbn=0861716469|page=195|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nikkyo Niwano]] describes a humanistic tone to the ways the emerging bodhisattvas greet the Buddha, inquiring about his health and the receptions of people to his teachings.  The implication is that the Buddha, as a religion founder, is not a godhead or the recipient of a divine revelation.  Rather, his enlightenment stemmed from his own personal efforts.{{refn|group=note|name="different "|Reeves: "In this respect, Buddhism...is quite different from most, perhaps all, other religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Gene|title=The stories of the Lotus sutra|date=2010|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Boston|isbn=0861716469|page=193|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Interpretation in the Sōtō Zen School===
[[Dōgen]], the founder of the Japanese [[Sōtō]] Zen school, made more references to the Lotus Sutra in his commentaries than any other sutras.  His commentaries focused primarily on the 15th (Emerging from the Earth) and 16th (Life Span) Chapters of the Lotus Sutra. Dōgen made numerous speculations about the significance of the bodhisattvas who emerged from the underground.&lt;ref name=Leighton&gt;{{Citation|last=Leighton |first=Taigen Dan |title=Dogen's Appropriation of Lotus Sutra Ground and Space |journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies |year=2005 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=85–105 |url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2862 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109095128/http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2862 |archivedate=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As conceived by Dōgen, the stories of the underground bodhisattvas and the Buddha's inconceivable life-span serve as a fundamental shift in the development of East Asian Mahayana understanding of Buddhahood, an immediate attainment based on fundamental awakening rather than an achievement based on lifetimes of arduous practice.&lt;ref&gt;Leighton 2005, pp. 85–105&lt;/ref&gt; This can be conceived as "Shortening the Path"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Groner|first1=Paul|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|editor2-last=|editor2-first=|editor1-link=|title=Shortening the Path: Early Tendai Interpretations of the Realization of Buddhahood with This Very Body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4580">In [[Ancient Rome]], the term "'''carmen'''" was generally used to signify a [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]; but in its proper sense, it referred to a [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] or [[prayer]], form of [[expiation]], [[execration]], etc. Surviving examples include the ''[[Carmen Arvale]]'' and the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==
Spells and incantations were used for a variety of purposes. If a spell was intended to harm someone, the State could interfere to protect him. For instance, it was not unusual for a farmer whose crops had failed to accuse another farmer of having, by a ''carmen'', lured the crops away. [[Tibullus]], in a poem in which he complains that an old woman has bewitched Marathus, takes the opportunity to recount various feats of witches, such as transferring crops from one field to another. Similarly, [[Pliny the Elder]] records in ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' (XVIII. 8) that a certain [[freedman]], Furius, by using better implements and better methods than his neighbor, obtained richer crops from a smaller strip of land. A neighbor compelled Furius to go before the tribes and accused him of having bewitched his field. But when the tribes saw his sturdy slaves and his implements of witchcraft&amp;mdash;hoes, rakes, and ploughs&amp;mdash;they acquitted him.&lt;ref name="tms"&gt;Burriss, Eli Edward. ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tms/tms00.htm Taboo, Magic, Spirits: A Study of Primitive Elements in Roman Religion]''. New York, Macmillan Company. 1931. Public domain.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=18:chapter=8&amp;highlight=furius&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chanting==
That incantations were chanted is a matter of common observance and scarcely needs illustration. For example, in magic rites, the purpose of which was to induce a dislocated or broken bone to come together, the incantation was sung (''cantare''). Tibullus writes that a witch composed a charm for him, to be chanted three times, after which he had to spit; then Delia's husband would believe gossip about other lovers of Delia, but not about her and Tibullus.&lt;ref name="tms"/&gt;

The two oldest prayers of the Romans which are still known&amp;mdash;the ''[[Carmen Arvale]]'' and the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]''&amp;mdash;were both chanted. [[Livy]] writes that "the leaping priests went through the city chanting their hymns." There is reason to believe that the old prayers which [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] has preserved in his treatise on agriculture were originally in metrical form; but in the directions given to the worshiper, the verb ''dicito'', and not ''cantato'', precedes the prayer, showing that, in Cato's time at least, such prayers were ''spoken'' rather than sung. However, these prayers, even in the form in which they are found in Cato, are predominantly [[spondaic]], in keeping with the slow movement of the chant and with the solemn religious character of the rites. In ceremonies intended to bring thunderbolts down from the sky, incantations were used.&lt;ref name="tms"/&gt;

==Repetition==
Repetition characterized the magic incantation. For instance, the incantation of the lover in [[Virgil]]'s eighth ''[[Eclogue]]'', already referred to, was repeated nine times; the incantation which the witch formulated for Tibullus had to be uttered three times. At the conclusion of the prayer to [[Pales]] is the following: "With these words the goddess must be appeased. So do you, facing the east, utter them four times...." The verses of the ''Carmen Saliare'' were each chanted three times, as the Leaping Priests of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] danced in threefold measure. [[William Warde Fowler|W. Warde Fowler]], who on the whole is not inclined to identify spell and prayer, writes in ''The Religious Experience of the Roman People'' (1911) that the verses "seem certainly to belong rather to the region of magic than of religion proper." Repetition was also characteristic of the ''Carmen Arvale'' and the prayer of the [[Fratres Attiedii]].&lt;ref name="tms"/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Carmen'' is derived from the root ''canere'' (meaning "to sing") with the passive nominal ending -''men'' (therefore "a thing sung," cf. ''flumen'' from ''fluere'' or ''numen'' from ''nuere'').&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, C. T. &amp; Short, C. 1879, ''A Latin Dictionary'', New York: Harper and Brothers; see the entry under '''carmen'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=charm&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upper Canada==
{{main|Upper Canada}}
The first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, [[John Graves Simcoe]], interpreted "Protestant clergy" to mean the clergy of [[Church of England]] only.{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|p=4}} However, in 1823 the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] held that the [[Church of Scotland]] was also entitled to a share of the revenues under the 1791 Act.{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|p=9}} Although [[Peregrine Maitland|Lt-Governor Maitland]] attempted to suppress the publication of that decision, the Legislature passed resolutions the following year that recognized that church's status.{{sfn|Fahey|1991|pp=75}}
[[File:Johnstrachan.JPG|thumb|right|[[John Strachan]]]]
Complications in establishing leasing procedures prevented the reserve lands from being leased before 1803.{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=9}} Until 1819, the reserve lands were managed by the Province, and in most years they earned revenues that were barely sufficient to cover their expenses.{{sfn|Ryerson|1884|p=220}} After the Rev. [[John Strachan]] was appointed to the [[Executive Council of Upper Canada]] in 1815, he began to push for the Church of England's autonomous control of the clergy reserves on the model of the Clergy Corporation created in Lower Canada in 1817. The [[Clergy Corporation]], of which Strachan became the chairman,{{sfn|Schrauwers|2009|p=3}}  was subsequently incorporated in 1819 to manage the Clergy Reserves.

The 1819 charter (drafted by Strachan's former student, Attorney General [[John Beverly Robinson]]){{sfn|Wilson|1959|p=135}} provided for the Bishop of Quebec to become the perpetual Principal and Director (as he was for the Lower Canada body), who, with twelve other directors, constituted the Board. The Bishop's Official (named by the Bishop) and the rectors of Niagara and York could each serve as acting chairman.

Other perpetual directors were:{{sfn|Wilson|1959|p=137}}

:* the incumbents at Kingston, Niagara, York, Cornwall, Grimsby, Ancaster and Hamilton; and
:* the Inspector General and Surveyor General of the Province of Upper Canada.

Any two directors, together with the Principal or an acting chairman, constituted a quorum,{{sfn|Wilson|1959|p=137}} but, because of the poor network of roads, most clergy members were generally unable to attend Corporation meetings.{{sfn|Schrauwers|2009|p=25}} This effectively meant that Strachan (as rector of York), together with the Inspector General and Surveyor General, controlled the Board.{{sfn|Wilson|1959|p=139}} These three members were part of the [[Family Compact]], of which Strachan was the leader.{{sfn|Schrauwers|2009|p=24}}

The reserves were allotted in [[Land lot|lots]] of {{convert|200|acre|ha|0}}, generally intermixed with other lots sold to individuals within each surveyed [[Township (Canada)|township]].{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|p=3}} Except in the [[Thomas Talbot (Upper Canada)|Talbot Settlement]] (where they were located off the main roads), they were generally arranged in a [[checkerboard]] pattern within each township,{{sfn|Wilson|1969|pp=7{{endash}}8}} and were a serious obstacle to economic development as they were effectively [[wiktionary:wasteland|wasteland]],{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=61}} either being abandoned by lessees after the timber had been fully harvested,{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=9}} or unattractive because of the availability of cheap freehold land.{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=9}} This was recognized by the Legislative Assembly in 1817 when it passed resolutions that condemned the lands as "insurmountable obstacles" and called on Westminster to authorize their sale.{{sfn|Fahey|1991|pp=74}}

Until 1827, no reserve lands were sold.{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|p=8}} They were leased for terms of twenty-one years, with rents on a [[sliding scale]]:{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|p=8}}

{| class="wikitable"

|}

Even with higher rates being charged from 1819, total annual revenues were still only £1200 in 1824, and only one-third could be collected without pursuing legal action.{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|p=8}}

In 1826, the [[Canada Company]] was formed to sell off the remaining crown and clergy reserves in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =An Act to enable his Majesty to grant to a company, to incorporated by charter, to be called "The Canada Company", certain lands in the province of Upper Canada, and to invest the said company with certain powers and privileges, and other privileges relating thereto|abbr =|year =6 Geo.

In 1836, before [[John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton|Sir John Colborne]] was succeeded by [[Sir Francis Bond Head]] as lieutenant-governor, he created 57 rectories for the Church of England, with glebe land totalling {{convert|21057|acre|km2|0}}.{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|pp=29{{endash}}30}} This action created significant political dissent,{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|pp=30{{endash}}31}} and was subsequently declared illegal in 1837,{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|p=31}} but was later held in 1856 to have been lawful.{{sfn|Ryerson|1884|p=224}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cihm_89291#page/n493/mode/1up ''Attorney-General v. Grasett''], (1857) 6 Gr. 200&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim, it became one of the issues in the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837 (and subsequently identified as such in [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|the 1838 report]] written by [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]]),{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=61}} where [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] exclaimed to the crowd outside [[Montgomery's Tavern]]:

{{cquote|
Stick true to the cause of Liberty, and you shall, every man of you, have three hundred Acres of Land and a piece out of the Clergy Reserves!{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=18}}
}}

The [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] passed a law to sell the reserves in 1840,{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|pp=41{{endash}}42}} but it was [[disallowance and reservation|disallowed]]{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|pp=43{{endash}}44}} and displaced by an Imperial Act passed later in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title =An Act to provide for the Sale of the Clergy Reserves in the Province of Canada, and for the Distribution of the Proceeds thereof|abbr =|year =3-4 Vic.|chapter =78|link=https://archive.org/stream/cihm_41745#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although considered to be more favourable to the Church of England,{{sfn|Lindsey|Rolph|1851|pp=45{{endash}}48}} the Act as passed provided that only one-half of future sales would be dedicated on a 2:1 basis to the Churches of England and Scotland, with the remaining half being distributed to all other churches according to their respective strengths.{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=19}} The administration of the reserve lands was transferred to the [[Commissioner of Crown Lands (Province of Canada)|Crown Lands Department]], where it was handled in a more professional manner.{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=19}}

==Lower Canada==
[[File:Jacob Mountain, 1st Lord Bishop of Quebec,1778.jpg|thumb|left|Bishop [[Jacob Mountain]]]]
Unlike the distribution of lots that was pursued by Simcoe in Upper Canada, [[Alured Clarke]], [[List of lieutenant governors of Quebec|lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada]], instituted a policy of setting aside large blocks of land apart from either current or contiguous settlement.{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=7}}

The Clergy Corporation in Lower Canada, more formally known as the "Corporation for Superintending, Managing and Conducting the Clergy Reserves within the Province of Lower-Canada", was constituted with the [[Anglican Diocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]] (initially the Right Rev. [[Jacob Mountain]]) as perpetual Principal and Director, and with rectors of four parishes within the diocese constituted as perpetual directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = By-laws, made, ordained and constituted by the Corporation for Superintending, Managing and Conducting the Clergy Reserves within the Province of Lower-Canada on Wednesday the 1st day of March, in the year of Our Lord Christ 1820|url = https://archive.org/stream/cihm_91242#page/n4/mode/1up|publisher = archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828, a British parliamentary committee reported that leases were being granted on certain terms:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Lease terms for clergy reserve lands in Lower Canada per 200-acre lot (1828)
|-

|Next 7 years ||align="right"|£2 10''s''.||align="right"|16 bushels
|-
|Last 7 years ||align="right"|£3 15''s''.||align="right"|24 bushels
|}

The reserve lands generated little income in Lower Canada, with the average annual profit from such activity amounting to only £3 between 1791 and 1837.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=60}}

==Abolition==
Pressure arose to reform the entire structure of the reserves, but the government of [[Robert Baldwin]] and [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine]] chose not to proceed on such a course, because of the resistance of the established churches and the roadblocks presented by the 1791 Act.{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=20}} However, such caution eventually came to be seen as inflexibility, which would be overcome by the rise of the [[Clear Grits|Grit movement]] in 1850.{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=20}}

Even as late as 1853, Strachan was still campaigning to ensure the Church of England's dominance in the matter. As he stated in a letter to [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle|Lord Newcastle]]:

{{cquote|
Can religious liberty be preserved in no other way than by putting all religions on a level, as equally entitled for support from public encouragement and protection ? Are the Koran, the Vedas, the book of the Mormons, and the Holy Bible, to be held equally sacred ? And are the public authorities, the organs by which the nation acts, to take any of these indifferently as the rule to direct them in their public proceedings ? And in a nation of Protestants, who have high and peculiar interests to preserve and transmit to posterity, are all places of power and trust, and even the Throne itself, to be open equally to the Atheist, the Infidel, the Pagan, the Mussulman, the Romanist, the Mormon and the Protestant ? Is the kingdom of Satan, in whatever shape it may appear, lo enjoy the same public favor as the Kingdom of God ? Is a Christian Church, a Pagan temple, and a mosque, to be equally held in honor? In one word, is "the freedom of the City to be bestowed on all the gods of mankind?"{{sfn|Strachan|1853|pp=26{{endash}}27}}
}}

Following the victory of [[Augustin-Norbert Morin]] and [[Allan MacNab]] in the [[List of elections in the Province of Canada#1854|1854 general election]], in conjunction with the abolition of [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial tenure]] in [[Lower Canada]],{{sfn|Wilson|1969|p=21}} the lands were finally removed from church control and secularized under an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]],{{sfn|Fahey|1991|pp=175}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to make better provision for the appropriation of Moneys arising from the lands heretofore known as the Clergy Reserves, by rendering them available for Municipal purposes|abbr =S.Prov.C.|year =1854|chapter =2|link= https://books.google.com/books?id=3CpCAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA85&amp;ots=eQbEuFPoNi&amp;pg=RA1-PA4#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; under which:{{sfn|Fahey|1991|pp=175}}

:* sales and other revenues from the reserves were constituted as separate funds dedicated to municipal purposes in Upper and Lower Canada,&lt;ref&gt;S.Prov.C. 1854, c. 2, s. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and
:* recipients of stipends could cede their life claims to their respective churches, which could in turn commute the sums of such claims at 6% ''[[per annum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;S.Prov.C. 1854, c. 2, s. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and aftermath==
Reform of the Clergy Reserves was a major issue in Canadian politics from its creation until its abolition. The controversy stemmed from the fact that many supporters of the religious endowment were part of the Tory ruling class. Even [[Robert Baldwin]], who was the leader of the struggle for [[Responsible Government]] did not advocate for complete abolition and chose to resign his seat rather than tackle the question.

In 1867, the Municipalities Funds for Upper and Lower Canada were declared to be part of the joint property of the new provinces of Ontario and Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =British North America Act, 1867|abbr =|year =30 &amp; 31 Vic.|chapter =3|schedule=IV|link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; subject to division and adjustment at a later date by arbitrators appointed under s. 142 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]]''. The funds were awarded to each province respectively in September 1870,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sessional Paper No. 9: Copy of the Award of the Arbitrators between the Provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, referred to in the second paragraph of the Speech from the Throne.

In December 2006, the Australian government responded to the newly formed CIPFG's petition alleging unethical [[Organ transplantation in China|organ transplant procedures in China]] by announcing the abolition of training programs for Chinese doctors in organ transplant procedures in the Prince Charles and the Princess Alexandra Hospitals as well as ending their joint research programs into organ transplantation with China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{about|the clerical office|other uses|Dean (disambiguation)}}

A '''dean''', in a church context, is a [[cleric]] holding certain positions of authority within a religious hierarchy. The title is used mainly in the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], and many [[Lutheranism|Lutheran denominations]]. A dean's assistant is called a subdean.

==History==

Latin ''decanus'' has various meanings related to the most important of ten parts, perhaps originally in astrology. In the military, it was the head of a group of ten, and by the 5th century CE, it was the head of a group of ten monks. It came to refer to various civil functionaries in the later Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' ''[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/47724 s.v.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the monastic use, it came to mean the head of a [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] of [[canon (priest)|canon]]s of a [[collegiate church]] or [[cathedral church]].&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

Based on that use, [[dean (academic)|deans]] in universities now fill various administrative positions.

== Officials ==
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] and the [[Cardinal Vice-Dean]] are the president and vice-president of the college. Both are elected. Except for presiding and delegating administrative tasks, they have no authority over the cardinals, acting as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (first among equals).

In the universities that grew out of the cathedral and monastery schools, a [[Dean (education)|university dean]] came to be an official with various administrative duties.

==Anglican Communion==
===Cathedrals===
{{See also|List of deans in the Church of England}}

In the [[Church of England]] and elsewhere in the [[Anglican Communion]], the dean is the chief resident cleric of a [[cathedral]] or other [[collegiate church]] and the head of the [[chapter (religion)|chapter of canons]]. If the cathedral or collegiate church has its own parish, the dean is usually also [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the parish. However, in the [[Church of Ireland]] the roles are often separated, and most cathedrals in the [[Church of England]] do not have associated parishes. In the [[Church in Wales]], however, most cathedrals are parish churches, and their deans are now also [[vicar]]s of their parishes.

In some parts of the Communion (particularly in the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] and, formerly in some cathedrals in England), the senior resident cleric in a cathedral is a [[provost (religion)|provost]]. Each [[diocese]] of the Scottish Episcopal Church has a ''dean of the diocese'': this is a cleric who, rather than heading the cathedral staff, assists the [[bishop]] in the administration of the diocese. In this way, a Scottish Episcopal dean is similar to an [[archdeacon]] in the other member churches of the Communion (a post that does not exist in the Scottish church). In the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], the roles of senior cleric of the cathedral are combined in one person who is referred to as "Rector of Cathedral and Dean of Diocese". Thus, [[Peter Elliott (priest)|Peter Elliott]] is Rector of [[Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver)|Christ Church Cathedral]] and Dean of [[Anglican Diocese of New Westminster|New Westminster]].

The style ''The [[Very Reverend]]'' distinguishes a cleric as a dean (or a cathedral provost). For example, the Very Reverend [[June Osborne]] was Dean of [[Salisbury Cathedral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salisburyjournal.co.uk/sj_opinion/qanda/10424489.Q___A_with_The_Very_Reverend_June_Osborne__Dean_of_Salisbury_Cathedral/|title=Q &amp; A with The Very Reverend June Osborne, Dean of Salisbury Cathedral|website=Salisbury Journal|language=en|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The legal act by which a cathedral dean in the Church of England takes up his or her role is the ''[[Institution (Christianity)|institution]]'', which is invariably followed in the same service by the [[Installation (Christianity)|installation]] (into his/her ''stall'' in the cathedral church); an "institution and installation" are very often referred to simply as an installation. In consideration of the high status of a Dean, the Very Reverend title is normally a permanent title preferment.

Some important deans include the deans of [[Dean of St Paul's|St Paul's]], [[Dean of Canterbury|Canterbury Cathedral]] and [[Westminster Abbey]]. Westminster Abbey is a [[royal peculiar]], not the seat of any bishop or a cathedral, but is led by a dean. The deans of [[Washington National Cathedral]] and [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]] are likewise important clerics in their churches.

===Rural or area deaneries===
{{main|Rural Dean}}
In many parts of the Anglican Communion, [[parish]]es are grouped together to form [[deanery|deaneries]], each being a constituent administrative district of the diocese. Usually, a deanery is led by one of the [[incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbents]] of the deanery's parishes, who is called a ''rural dean'', but in more urban areas this has often been replaced by the title ''area dean'' or ''regional dean''. Such a dean chairs the meeting of the deanery's clergy (which, like a cathedral, is called a chapter), and may also chair a [[Deanery Synod|deanery synod]]. [[Rural Dean]]s (and those known by alternative titles) rank as [[primus inter pares|primi inter pares]] of their chapters, and do not have the seniority of cathedral or diocesan deans.

===Other uses===
The head of an Anglican [[seminary|theological college]] or [[seminary]] may also be called a [[dean (education)|dean]] (in common with its use in [[education]]).

==Catholic Church==
{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}
The title "dean" is conferred upon a pastor of a parish who serves as a senior figure, though usually without specific jurisdictional authority, over a section of a diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-02-17|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04659a.htm|title=Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are sometimes referred to as "rural deans", and are expected to show a degree of leadership among the pastors of the region, known as a [[deanery]]. This function is sometimes titled "vicar forane". An [[episcopal vicar]] serves a similar function, but has more formal authority and specific powers under [[canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]].

In recent years, the [[Catholic Church]] in England and Wales has introduced the custom of designating cathedral deans, formerly known as cathedral administrators. However, the term differs slightly from the Anglican usage as Catholic deans do not necessarily preside over the [[cathedral chapter]] (this function belonging to the office of [[Provost (religion)|Provost]]), and are not necessarily required even to be a member of the chapter. More commonly, in places throughout the world where a cathedral chapter has not been erected (as for instance, in the United States, where there are no chapters at all), the term [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] is used for the priest who serves as chief administrator of a cathedral church.

Another important use of the term within the Catholic Church is in the office of the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]], who serves as senior member of that body. Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]] is the current dean.

==Lutheran Church==
Within the Lutheran tradition, particularly in the Nordic and Baltic tradition of evangelical episcopal Lutheranism, senior clergy bear the title 'Dean'. Each diocese usually has a cathedral Dean, in charge of the cathedral church, and a series of area deans to supervise the clergy in a given geographical area. In the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], there are also deans in charge of leading the administrative work and personnel of the Chapters. &lt;ref&gt;See for example the structure of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia [http://www.lelb.lv/en/?ct=clergy here].&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Methodism==
[[United Methodism|United Methodist]] Christians often speak of a "dean" in terms of the dean of the cabinet. Every annual conference has a bishop's cabinet made up of the district superintendents under the bishop's appointment, as well as occasionally a few other conference officials. One of these superintendents is chosen by his or her colleagues to serve as the dean, usually for one year. This dean then has certain administrative and leadership responsibilities, and is accountable to the bishop.

==Other uses==
In various other religious denominations, the title "dean" may be used informally in its wider sense of a senior or venerated member of a congregation. The title may also used in its academic sense in parochial schools.

The '''Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The Act amends the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]] to allow one party to petition a court to not declare their divorce decree absolute until they have received a similar document from a religion's authority.

The Act was brought before Parliament by [[Andrew Dismore]] MP as a [[Private Members' Bill]] under the [[Ten Minute Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jul/27/religion.world1|title=Law seeks to ease Jewish divorces|author=Stephen Bates|date=27 July 2002|accessdate=2012-07-26|location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act applies only to [[England and Wales]].

The need for the legislation was demonstrated in the 2000 divorce case of ''O v O''.&lt;ref&gt;''O v O (Jurisdiction: Jewish Divorce)'' [2000] 2 FLR 147&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{transl|sem|’Ēl|italics=no}}''' (or '''’Il''', written ''[[aleph]]-[[lamedh]]'', e.g. {{lang-uga|𐎛𐎍}}; {{lang-phn|𐤀𐤋}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155548/http://canaanite.org/dictionary/index.php?a=srch&amp;d=18&amp;id_srch=6226bd8234e202e3bd888f76207bcb7d&amp;il=en&amp;p=1 ''Online Phoenician Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he-n|אל}}; {{lang-syr|ܐܠ}}; {{lang-ar|إل}} or {{lang|ar|إله|rtl=yes}}; cognate to {{lang-akk|𒀭|ilu}}) is a [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] word meaning "[[God (male deity)|god]]" or "[[deity]]", or referring (as a proper name) to any one of multiple major ancient Near Eastern deities. A rarer form, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;ila'', represents the predicate form in Old Akkadian and in [[Amorite language|Amorite]].{{sfn|Cross|1997|p=14}} The word is derived from the [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] archaic biliteral [[wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/ʾil-|{{transl|sem|ʾ&amp;#8209;l}}]], meaning "god".

Specific deities known as ''ʾEl'' or ''ʾIl'' include the supreme god of the [[ancient Canaanite religion]]{{sfn|Matthews|2004|p=79}} and the supreme god of [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic speakers]] in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]].{{sfn|Gelb|1961|p=6}}

==Linguistic forms and meanings==
[[Cognate]] forms are found throughout the [[Semitic languages]]. They include [[Ugaritic]] {{lang|uga-Latn|ʾilu}}, pl. {{lang|uga-Latn|ʾlm}}; [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] {{lang|phn-Latn|ʾl}} pl. {{lang|phn-Latn|ʾlm}}; [[Hebrew]] {{lang|he-Latn|ʾēl}}, pl. {{lang|he-Latn|ʾēlîm}}; [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|arc-Latn|ʾl}}; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] {{lang|akk-Latn|ilu}}, pl. {{lang|akk-Latn|ilānu}}.

In northwest Semitic use, ''El'' was both a generic word for any god and the special name or title of a particular god who was distinguished from other gods as being "the god".{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=135}}
El is listed at the head of many pantheons. In some [[Canaanites|Canaanite]] and Ugaritic sources, El played a role as father of the gods or of creation.&lt;ref name="Leeming2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Leeming|title=The Oxford Companion to World Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;pg=PA60|date=17 November 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-515669-0|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because the word sometimes refers to a god other than the great god Ēl, it is frequently ambiguous as to whether Ēl followed by another name means the great god Ēl with a particular epithet applied or refers to another god entirely. For example, in the Ugaritic texts, ''ʾil mlk'' is understood{{sfn|Rahmouni|2007|p=41}} to mean "Ēl the King" but ''ʾil hd'' as "the god [[Hadad]]".{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The Semitic root ''ʾlh'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|[[ʾilāh]]}}'', Aramaic ''ʾAlāh'', ''ʾElāh'', Hebrew ''ʾelōah'') may be ''ʾl'' with a parasitic h, and ''ʾl'' may be an abbreviated form of ''ʾlh''. In Ugaritic the plural form meaning "gods" is {{lang|uga-Latn|ʾilhm}}, equivalent to Hebrew {{lang|he-Latn|[[Elohim|ʾ&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;lōhîm]]}} "powers". In the Hebrew texts this word is interpreted as being semantically singular for "god" by biblical commentators.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book |last1=Keller |first1=Catherine |author-link1=Catherine Keller (theologian) |chapter=The Pluri-Singularity of Creation |editor1-last=McFarland |editor1-first=Ian A. |title=Creation and Humanity: The Sources of Christian Theology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7E12H6cjqUoC&amp;q=%22Its+ending+marks+it+stubbornly%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Its%20ending%20marks%20it%20stubbornly%22&amp;f=false |series=Sources of Christian theology |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |publication-date=2009 |page=74 |isbn=9780664231354 |accessdate=2015-07-08 |quote=[...] ''Elohim''—a flux of syllables, labial, multiple.

The stem ''ʾl'' is found prominently in the earliest strata of east Semitic, northwest Semitic, and south Semitic groups. Personal names including the stem ''ʾl'' are found with similar patterns in both [[Amorite language|Amorite]] and [[Sabaean language|Sabaic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sabaic dictionary: English, French, Arabic|last=Beeston|first=A.

==Proto-Sinaitic, Phoenician, Aramaic, and Hittite texts==

The Egyptian god [[Ptah]] is given the title ''ḏū gitti'' 'Lord of [[Gath (city)|Gath]]' in a prism from [[Tel Lachish]] which has on its opposite face the name of [[Amenhotep II]] (c. 1435–1420 BCE). The title ''ḏū gitti'' is also found in Serābitṭ text 353. Cross (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;19) points out that Ptah is often called ''the Lord (or one) of eternity'' and thinks it may be this identification of ʼĒl with Ptah that lead to the epithet ''’olam'' 'eternal' being applied to ʼĒl so early and so consistently.{{sfn|Cross|1973|p=19}} (However, in the Ugaritic texts, Ptah is seemingly identified rather with the craftsman god Kothar-wa-Khasis.){{sfn|Wyatt|2002|p=43}}

A [[Phoenicia]]n inscribed [[Arslan Tash amulets|amulet of the seventh century BCE from Arslan Tash]] may refer to ʼĒl. The text was translated by Rosenthal (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;658) as follows:

{{poemquote|An eternal bond has been established for us.
''Ashshur'' has established (it) for us,
and all the divine beings
and ''the majority of the group'' of all the holy ones,
through the bond of heaven and earth ''for ever'', ...{{sfn|Rosenthal|1969|p=658}}}}

However, Cross (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;17) translated the text as follows:

{{poemquote|The Eternal One (‘Olam) has made a covenant oath with us,
Asherah has made (a pact) with us.
And all the sons of El,
And the great council of all the Holy Ones.
With oaths of Heaven and Ancient Earth.{{sfn|Cross|1973|p=17}}}}

In some inscriptions, the name ''’Ēl qōne ’arṣ'' meaning "ʼĒl creator of Earth" appears, even including a late inscription at Leptis Magna in [[Tripolitania]] dating to the second century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFDonnerRöllig1962–1964|Donner &amp; Röllig 1962–1964]], No. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hittite texts, the expression becomes the single name ''Ilkunirsa'', this Ilkunirsa appearing as the husband of Asherdu (Asherah) and father of 77 or 88 sons.{{sfn|Binger|1997|p=92}}

In a Hurrian hymn to ʼĒl (published in ''Ugaritica V'', text RS 24.278), he is called ''’il brt'' and ''’il dn'' which Cross (p.&amp;nbsp;39) takes as 'ʼĒl of the covenant' and 'ʼĒl the judge' respectively.{{sfn|Cross|1973|p=39}}

==Amorites==
[[Amorite language|Amorite]] inscriptions from [[Sam'al]] refer to numerous gods, sometimes by name, sometimes by title, especially by such titles as ''Ilabrat'' 'God of the people'(?), ''ʾil abīka'' "God of your father", ''ʾil abīni'' "God of our father" and so forth. Various family gods are recorded, divine names listed as belonging to a particular family or clan, sometimes by title and sometimes by name, including the name ''ʾil'' "God". In Amorite personal names, the most common divine elements are ''ʾil'' "God", ''[[Hadad]]''/''Adad'', and [[Dagon|''Dagan'']]. It is likely that ''ʾil'' is also very often the god called in Akkadian texts ''[[Amurru (god)|Amurru]]'' or ''ʾil ʾamurru''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Ugarit and the Levant==
For the [[Canaanites]] and the ancient [[Levant]]ine region as a whole, Ēl or Il was the supreme god, the father of mankind and all creatures.{{sfn|Kugel|2007|p=423}} He also fathered many gods, most importantly [[Hadad]], [[Yam (god)|Yam]], and [[Mot (Semitic god)|Mot]], each sharing similar attributes to the Greco-Roman gods: [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], and [[Hades]] respectively.

As recorded on the [[clay tablet]]s of [[Ugarit]], El is the husband of the goddess [[Asherah]].

Three pantheon lists found at [[Ugarit]] (modern {{transl|apc|Ras Shamrā}}—{{lang-ar|رأس شمرا|rtl=yes}}, [[Syria]]) begin with the four gods ''’il-’ib'' (which according to Cross;{{sfn|Cross|1973|p=14}} is the name of a generic kind of deity, perhaps the divine ancestor of the people), Ēl, Dagnu (that is [[Dagon]]), and [[Baal|Ba’l]] Ṣapān (that is the god Haddu or [[Hadad]]).{{sfn|Cross|1973|p=14}} Though Ugarit had a large temple dedicated to Dagon and another to Hadad, there was no temple dedicated to Ēl.

Ēl is called again and again ''&lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;ôru ‘Ēl'' ("Bull Ēl" or "the bull god"). He is ''bātnyu binwāti'' ("Creator of creatures"), ''’abū banī ’ili'' ("father of the gods"), and ''‘abū ‘adami'' ("father of man"). He is ''qāniyunu ‘ôlam'' ("creator eternal"), the epithet ''‘ôlam'' appearing in Hebrew form in the Hebrew name of God ''’ēl ‘ôlam'' "God Eternal" in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 21.33. He is ''ḥātikuka'' ("your patriarch"). Ēl is the grey-bearded ancient one, full of wisdom, ''malku'' ("King"), ''’abū šamīma'' ("Father of years"), ''’El gibbōr'' ("Ēl the warrior"). He is also named ''lṭpn'' of unknown meaning, variously rendered as Latpan, Latipan, or Lutpani ("shroud-face" by ''Strong's Hebrew Concordance'').

"El" (Father of Heaven / Saturn) and his major son: "Hadad" (Father of Earth / Jupiter), are symbolized both by the bull, and both wear bull horns on their headdresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In Canaanite mythology, El builds a desert sanctuary with his children and his two wives, leading to speculation {{By whom|date=April 2015}} that at one point El was a desert god.

The mysterious Ugaritic text ''Shachar and Shalim'' tells how (perhaps near the beginning of all things) Ēl came to shores of the [[sea]] and saw two women who bobbed up and down. Ēl was sexually aroused and took the two with him, killed a [[bird]] by throwing a staff at it, and roasted it over a fire. He asked the women to tell him when the bird was fully cooked, and to then address him either as husband or as father, for he would thenceforward behave to them as they called him. They saluted him as husband. He then lay with them, and they gave birth to ''Shachar'' ("Dawn") and ''Shalim'' ("Dusk"). Again Ēl lay with his wives and the wives gave birth to "the gracious gods", "cleavers of the sea", "children of the sea". The names of these wives are not explicitly provided, but some confusing rubrics at the beginning of the account mention the goddess [[Asherah|Athirat]], who is otherwise Ēl's chief wife, and the goddess Raḥmayyu ("the one of the womb"), otherwise unknown.

In the Ugaritic [[Baal cycle|Ba‘al cycle]], Ēl is introduced dwelling on (or in) Mount Lel (''Lel'' possibly meaning "Night") at the fountains of the two rivers at the spring of the two deeps. He dwells in a tent according to some interpretations of the text which may explain why he had no temple in Ugarit. As to the rivers and the spring of the two deeps, these might refer to real streams, or to the mythological sources of the salt water ocean and the fresh water sources under the earth, or to the waters above the heavens and the waters beneath the earth.

In the episode of the "Palace of Ba‘al", the god Ba‘al Hadad invites the "seventy sons of Athirat" to a feast in his new palace. Presumably these sons have been fathered on Athirat by Ēl; in following passages they seem be the gods (''’ilm'') in general or at least a large portion of them. The only sons of Ēl named individually in the Ugaritic texts are Yamm ("Sea"), Mot ("Death"), and [[Attar (god)|Ashtar]], who may be the chief and leader of most of the sons of Ēl. Ba‘al Hadad is a few times called Ēl's son rather than the son of [[Dagan (god)|Dagan]] as he is normally called, possibly because Ēl is in the position of a clan-father to all the gods.

The fragmentary text R.S. 24.258 describes a banquet to which Ēl invites the other gods and then disgraces himself by becoming outrageously drunk and passing out after confronting an otherwise unknown Hubbay, "he with the horns and tail". The text ends with an incantation for the cure of some disease, possibly hang-over.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] form (אל) appears in Latin letters in [[Standard Hebrew]] transcription as El and in [[Tiberian Hebrew]] transcription as ʾĒl. ''El'' is a generic word for ''god'' that could be used for any god, including [[Hadad]], [[Moloch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Yahweh]]. 

In the [[Tanakh]], ''[[Elohim|’&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;lōhîm]]'' is the normal word for a god or the great god (or gods, given that the 'im' suffix makes a word plural in Hebrew). But the form ''’El'' also appears, mostly in poetic passages and in the patriarchal narratives attributed to the [[Priestly source]] of the [[documentary hypothesis]]. It occurs 217 times in the [[Masoretic Text]]: seventy-three times in the [[Psalms]] and fifty-five times in the [[Book of Job]], and otherwise mostly in poetic passages or passages written in elevated prose. It occasionally appears with the definite article as ''hā’Ēl'' 'the god' (for example in {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|22:31,33–48|HE}}).

The theological position of the Tanakh is that the names ''Ēl'' and ''’Ĕlōhîm'', when used in the singular to mean the supreme god, refer to Yahweh, beside whom other gods are supposed to be either nonexistent or insignificant. Whether this was a long-standing belief or a relatively new one has long been the subject of inconclusive scholarly debate about the prehistory of the sources of the Tanakh and about the prehistory of Israelite religion. In the P strand, [[YHWH]] says in {{bibleverse||Exodus|6:2–3|HE}}:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I revealed myself to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as [[Ēl Shaddāi]], but was not known to them by my name, YHVH.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before El's revelation with the name of Yahweh, it is said in {{bibleverse||Genesis|14:18–20|HE}} that Abraham accepted the blessing of El, when [[Melchizedek]], the king of [[Salem (Bible)|Salem]] and high priest of its deity [[El Elyon]] blessed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholarly position is that the identification of Yahweh with Ēl is late, that Yahweh was earlier thought of as only one of many gods, and not normally identified with Ēl. Another is that in much of the Hebrew Bible the name El is an alternate name for Yahweh, but in the [[Elohist]] and Priestly traditions it is conceived as an earlier name than Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Destruction of Leviathan.png|right|250px|thumb|''The Destruction of Leviathan'' by [[Gustave Doré]] (1865)]]

In some places, especially in {{bibleverse||Psalm|29|HE}}, Yahweh is clearly envisioned as a [[weather god|storm god]], something not true of Ēl so far as we know (although true of his son, Ba'al Hadad). It is Yahweh who is prophesied to one day battle [[Leviathan]] the serpent, and slay the dragon in the sea in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|27:1|HE}}. The slaying of the serpent in myth is a deed attributed to both Ba’al Hadad and ‘Anat in the Ugaritic texts, but not to Ēl.

Such mythological motifs are variously seen as late survivals from a period when Yahweh held a place in theology comparable to that of Hadad at Ugarit; or as late [[henotheistic]]/monotheistic applications to Yahweh of deeds more commonly attributed to Hadad; or simply as examples of eclectic application of the same motifs and imagery to various different gods. Similarly, it is argued inconclusively whether Ēl Shaddāi, Ēl ‘Ôlām, Ēl ‘Elyôn, and so forth, were originally understood as separate divinities. [[Albrecht Alt]] presented his theories on the original differences of such gods in ''Der Gott der Väter'' in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But others have argued that from patriarchal times, these different names were in fact generally understood to refer to the same single great god, Ēl. This is the position of [[Frank Moore Cross]] (1973).{{sfn|Cross|1973}} What is certain is that the form ’El does appear in Israelite names from every period including the name ''Yiśrā’ēl'' ("Israel"), meaning "El strives" or "struggled with El".

According to ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems almost certain that the God of the Jews evolved gradually from the Canaanite El, who was in all likelihood the "God of Abraham"... If El was the high God of Abraham—Elohim, the prototype of Yahveh—Asherah was his wife, and there are archaeological indications that she was perceived as such before she was in effect "divorced" in the context of emerging Judaism of the 7th century BCE.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The apparent plural form ''’Ēlîm'' or ''’Ēlim'' "gods" occurs only four times in the Tanakh. {{bibleverse||Psalm|29|HE}}, understood as an enthronement psalm, begins:

{{poemquote|A Psalm of David.

Ascribe to Yahweh, sons of Gods (''b&lt;sup&gt;ê&lt;/sup&gt;nê ’Ēlîm''),
Ascribe to Yahweh, glory and strength}}

{{bibleverse||Psalm|89:6|HE}} (verse 7 in Hebrew) has:

{{poemquote|For who in the skies compares to Yahweh,
who can be likened to Yahweh among the sons of Gods (''b&lt;sup&gt;ê&lt;/sup&gt;nê ’Ēlîm'').}}

Traditionally ''b&lt;sup&gt;ê&lt;/sup&gt;nê ’ēlîm'' has been interpreted as 'sons of the mighty', 'mighty ones', for ''’El'' can mean 'mighty', though such use may be metaphorical (compare the English expression ''[by] God awful''). It is possible also that the expression ''’ēlîm'' in both places descends from an archaic stock phrase in which ''’lm'' was a singular form with the ''m''-enclitic and therefore to be translated as 'sons of Ēl'. The ''m''-enclitic appears elsewhere in the Tanakh and in other Semitic languages. Its meaning is unknown, possibly simply emphasis. It appears in similar contexts in Ugaritic texts where the expression ''bn ’il'' alternates with ''bn ’ilm'', but both must mean 'sons of Ēl'. That phrase with ''m''-enclitic also appears in Phoenician inscriptions as late as the fifth century BCE.

One of the other two occurrences in the Tanakh is in the "Song of Moses", {{bibleverse||Exodus|15:11a|HE}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is like you among the Gods (''’ēlim''), Yahweh?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final occurrence is in {{bibleverse||Daniel|11:36|HE}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And the king will do according to his pleasure; and he will exalt himself and magnify himself over every god (''’ēl''), and against the God of Gods (''’El ’Elîm'') he will speak outrageous things, and will prosper until the indignation is accomplished: for that which is decided will be done.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are a few cases in the Tanakh where some think ''’El'' referring to the great god Ēl is not equated with Yahweh. One is in {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|28:2|HE}}, in the taunt against a man who claims to be divine, in this instance, the leader of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: "Thus says the Lord Yahweh: 'Because your heart is proud and you have said: "I am ''’ēl'' (god), in the seat of ''’&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;lōhîm'' (''gods''), I am enthroned in the middle of the seas." Yet you are man and not ''’El'' even though you have made your heart like the heart of ''’&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;lōhîm'' ('gods').{{'"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here ''’ēl'' might refer to a generic god, or to a highest god, Ēl.  When viewed as applying to the King of Tyre specifically, the king was probably not thinking of Yahweh.  When viewed as a general taunt against anyone making divine claims, it may or may not refer to Yahweh depending on the context.

In {{bibleverse||Judges|9:46|HE}} we find ''’Ēl B&lt;sup&gt;ê&lt;/sup&gt;rît'' 'God of the Covenant', seemingly the same as the ''Ba‘al B&lt;sup&gt;ê&lt;/sup&gt;rît'' 'Lord of the Covenant' whose worship has been condemned a few verses earlier. See [[Baal]] for a discussion of this passage.

{{bibleverse||Psalm|82:1|HE}} says:

{{poemquote|''’&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;lōhîm'' ("god") stands in the council of ''’ēl''
he judges among the gods (''Elohim'').}}

This could mean that Yahweh judges along with many other gods as one of the council of the high god Ēl. However it can also mean that Yahweh stands in the [[Divine Council]] (generally known as the Council of Ēl), as Ēl judging among the other members of the Council. The following verses in which the god condemns those whom he says were previously named ''gods'' (''Elohim'') and ''sons of the Most High'' suggest the god here is in fact Ēl judging the lesser gods.

An archaic phrase appears in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:13|HE}}, ''kôkk&lt;sup&gt;ê&lt;/sup&gt;bê ’ēl'' 'stars of God', referring to the circumpolar stars that never set, possibly especially to the seven stars of [[Ursa Major]]. The phrase also occurs in the [[Pyrgi Tablets|Pyrgi Inscription]] as ''hkkbm ’l'' (preceded by the definite article ''h'' and followed by the ''m''-enclitic). Two other apparent fossilized expressions are ''arzê-’ēl'' 'cedars of God' (generally translated something like 'mighty cedars', 'goodly cedars') in {{bibleverse||Psalm|80:10|HE}} (in Hebrew verse 11) and ''k&lt;sup&gt;ê&lt;/sup&gt;harrê-’ēl'' 'mountains of God' (generally translated something like 'great mountains', 'mighty mountains') in {{bibleverse||Psalm|36:7|HE}} (in Hebrew verse 6).

For the reference in some texts of {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|32:8|HE}} to seventy sons of God corresponding to the seventy sons of Ēl in the Ugaritic texts, see [[`Elyôn]].

==Sanchuniathon==
[[Philo of Byblos]] (c. 64–141 AD) was a Greek writer whose account ''[[Sanchuniathon]]'' survives in quotation by [[Eusebius]] and may contain the major surviving traces of Phoenician mythology. Ēl (rendered ''Elus'' or called by his standard [[Greek mythology|Greek]] counterpart [[Cronus]]) is not the creator God or first God. Ēl is rather the son of Sky (Uranus) and Earth (Ge).&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Sky and Earth are themselves children of [[Elyon|‘Elyôn]] 'Most High'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Ēl is brother to the God [[Bethel (god)|Bethel]], to [[Dagon]] and to an unknown god, equated with the Greek [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and to the goddesses [[Aphrodite]]/[[Astarte|’Ashtart]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] (presumably [[Asherah]]), and [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]] (equated with [[Ba‘alat Gebal]]). Ēl is the father of [[Persephone]] and of Athena (presumably the goddess ‘[[Anat]]).&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

Sky and Earth have separated from one another in hostility, but Sky insists on continuing to force himself on Earth and attempts to destroy the children born of such unions. At last, Ēl, with the advice of his daughter Athena and the god [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (perhaps [[Thoth]]), Ēl successfully attacks his father Sky with a sickle and spear of iron. He and his military allies the ''Eloim'' gain Sky's kingdom.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

In a later passage it is explained that Ēl castrated Sky. One of Sky's concubines (who was given to Ēl's brother Dagon) was already pregnant by Sky. The son who is born of the union, called Demarûs or Zeus, but once called Adodus, is obviously Hadad, the Ba‘al of the Ugaritic texts who now becomes an ally of his grandfather Sky and begins to make war on Ēl.

Ēl has three wives, his sisters or half-sisters Aphrodite/Astarte (‘Ashtart), Rhea (presumably Asherah), and Dione (identified by Sanchuniathon with Ba‘alat Gebal the tutelary goddess of [[Byblos]], a city which Sanchuniathon says that Ēl founded).

El is depicted primarily as a warrior; in Ugaritic sources Baal has the warrior role and El is peaceful, and it may be that the ''Sanchuniathon'' depicts an earlier tradition that was more preserved in the southern regions of Canaan.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Patrick D. |title=El the Warrior |journal=The Harvard Theological Review |date=1967 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=411–431 |jstor=509250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=Alberto Ravinell Whitney |title=The Storm-god in the Ancient Near East |date=2003 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |isbn=9781575060699 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255}}

[[Eusebius]], through whom the ''Sanchuniathon'' is preserved, is not interested in setting the work forth completely or in order. But we are told that Ēl slew his own son Sadidus (a name that some commentators think might be a corruption of ''Shaddai'', one of the epithets of the Biblical Ēl) and that Ēl also beheaded one of his daughters. Later, perhaps referring to this same death of Sadidus we are told:

{{quote|text=But on the occurrence of a pestilence and mortality Cronus offers his only begotten son as a whole burnt-offering to his father Sky and circumcises himself, compelling his allies also to do the same.}}

A fuller account of the sacrifice appears later:
{{quote|text=It was a custom of the ancients in great crises of danger for the rulers of a city or nation, in order to avert the common ruin, to give up the most beloved of their children for sacrifice as a ransom to the avenging daemons; and those who were thus given up were sacrificed with mystic rites. Cronus then, whom the Phoenicians call Elus, who was king of the country and subsequently, after his decease, was deified as the star [[Saturn]], had by a nymph of the country named Anobret an only begotten son, whom they on this account called Iedud, the only begotten being still so called among the Phoenicians; and when very great dangers from war had beset the country, he arrayed his son in royal apparel, and prepared an altar, and sacrificed him.}}

The account also relates that Thoth:
{{quote|text=also devised for Cronus as insignia of royalty four eyes in front and behind ... but two of them quietly closed, and upon his shoulders four wings, two as spread for flying, and two as folded. And the symbol meant that Cronus could see when asleep, and sleep while waking: and similarly in the case of the wings, that he flew while at rest, and was at rest when flying. But to each of the other gods he gave two wings upon the shoulders, as meaning that they accompanied Cronus in his flight. And to Cronus himself again he gave two wings upon his head, one representing the all-ruling mind, and one sensation.}}

This is the form under which Ēl/Cronus appears on coins from Byblos from the reign of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (175–164 BCE) four spread wings and two folded wings, leaning on a staff. Such images continued to appear on coins until after the time of [[Augustus]].

==Poseidon==

A bilingual inscription from [[Palmyra]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFDonnerRöllig1962–1964|Donner &amp; Röllig 1962–1964]], No. 11, p. 43. and No. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; dated to the 1st century equates ''Ēl-Creator-of-the-Earth'' with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Poseidon]]. Going back to the 8th century BCE, the bilingual inscription&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFDonnerRöllig1962–1964|Donner &amp; Röllig 1962–1964]], No. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Karatepe]] in the [[Taurus Mountains]] equates ''Ēl-Creator-of-the-Earth'' to Luwian hieroglyphs read as ''&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;a-a-ś'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; this being the Luwian form of the name of the [[Babylonia]]n water god [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]], lord of the abyss of water under the earth. (This inscription lists Ēl in second place in the local pantheon, following [[Baalshamin|Ba‘al Shamîm]] and preceding the ''Eternal Sun''.)

Poseidon is known to have been worshipped in [[Beirut]], his image appearing on coins from that city. Poseidon of Beirut was also worshipped at [[Delos]] where there was an association of merchants, shipmasters, and warehousemen called the Poseidoniastae of Berytus founded in 110 or 109 BCE. Three of the four chapels at its headquarters on the hill northwest of the Sacred Lake were dedicated to Poseidon, the [[Tyche]] of the city equated with Astarte (that is ‘Ashtart), and to [[Eshmun]].

Also at Delos, that association of Tyrians, though mostly devoted to [[Heracles]]-[[Melqart]], elected a member to bear a crown every year when sacrifices to Poseidon took place. A banker named Philostratus donated two altars, one to Palaistine [[Aphrodite Urania]] (‘Ashtart) and one to Poseidon "of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]]".

Though Sanchuniathon distinguishes Poseidon from his Elus/Cronus, this might be a splitting off of a particular aspect of Ēl in a euhemeristic account. Identification of an aspect of Ēl with Poseidon rather than with Cronus might have been felt to better fit with Hellenistic religious practice, if indeed this Phoenician Poseidon really is Ēl who dwells at the source of the two deeps in Ugaritic texts. More information is needed to be certain.

The Smritis of Hinduism recognize [[Hindu wedding#Eight types of marriage|eight methods of marriage]], one of them being Gandharva marriage. The other seven are: ''Brahma'', ''Daiva'', ''Arya'', ''Prajapatya'', ''Asura'', ''Raksasa'' and ''Paisacha''.&lt;ref name=jgl2001B&gt;The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, James G. Lochtefeld (2001), {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, Page 427&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rjb1969&gt;Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, Rajbali Pandey (1969), see Chapter VIII, {{ISBN|978-8120803961}}, pages 153-233&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Apastamba Grhyasutra'', an ancient Hindu literature, Gandharva marriage is a method of marriage where the woman chooses her own husband. They meet each other of their own accord, consent to live together, and their relationship is consummated in copulation born of passion. This form of marriage did not require consent of parents or anyone else. According to Vedic texts, this is one of earliest and common forms of marriage in Rig Vedic times.&lt;ref name=rjb1969/&gt;

In Rig vedic opinions and classical literature, the commonly described marriage method was Gandharva, where the bride and the groom had met each other in their ordinary village life, or in various other places such as regional festivals and fairs, begun to enjoy each other's company, and decided to be together. This free choice and mutual attraction were generally approved by their kinsmen. A passage in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' suggests that parents usually left the daughter free in selection of her lover and directly encouraged her in being forward in love-affairs. The mother of the girl thought of the time when the daughter's developed youth (''Pativedanam'', post-puberty), that she would win a husband for herself, it was a smooth and happy sort of affair with nothing scandalous and unnatural about it.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, Rajbali Pandey (1969), see Chapter VIII, {{ISBN|978-8120803961}}, pages 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jjm1989"&gt;{{Citation | title=Sexual life in ancient India: a study in the comparative history of Indian culture | author=Johann Jakob Meyer | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 1989 | isbn=978-81-208-0638-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translated version of the ''Atharvaveda'' (Strikaratâni, ii.36) passage is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
May (Oh Agni!) a suitor after our own heart come to us;
may he come to this maiden with fortune;
May she be agreeable to suitors,
:charming at festivals,
:promptly obtain happiness through a husband.

As this comfortable cave (Oh Indra!) furnishing a safe abode
hath become pleasing to all life,
thus may this woman be a favourite of fortune,
:well beloved,
:not at odds with her husband!

Do thou ascend the full, inexhaustible ship of fortune
to bring hither to this woman the suitor who shall be agreeable to thee.
Bring hither by thy shouts (Oh lord of wealth!) the suitor &amp;ndash;
:bend his mind towards her.
:Turn thou the attention of every agreeable suitor to her.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Mahabharata]], one of two major epics of Hindus, Rishi Kanva, the foster father of [[Shakuntala]], recommends Gandharva marriage with the statement “''The marriage of a desiring woman with a desiring man, without religious ceremonies, is the best marriage''.”&lt;ref&gt;See Mahabharata, iv, 94.60, as translated by Rajbali Pandey (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in Mahabharata (iii:190.36), the epic says “''No man any longer asks for the daughter, nor does a father give away his daughter, they (women) find the man for themselves''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Sexual life in ancient India: a study in the comparative history of Indian culture | author=Johann Jakob Meyer | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 1989 | isbn=978-81-208-0638-2|page = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The historic debate on Gandharva marriage==
[[File:Hidamba Devi Temple in Manali.JPG|thumb|Hidamba Devi Temple in Manali (India) - dedicated to the wife and ''Paandav Bheem'', joined by ''Gandharva'' marriage]]
Gandharva marriage over time became controversial, disputed and debated. Majority of ancient scholars discouraged it on religious and moral grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, Rajbali Pandey (1969), see Chapter VIII, {{ISBN|978-8120803961}}, see page 163&lt;/ref&gt; One argument found in the classical literature is that Gandharva marriage originates and sustains from lust, ignores the sacred rituals and vows the groom and bride must make to each other, and it does not consider other aspects of a relationship necessary in a long married life that lasts through the old age. Such a marriage, argued these ancient vedic scholars, may or may not be lasting.

[[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] argued that Gandharva marriage may be suited for some, but not for most; he argues Gandharva marriage is best suited for males who are warriors, serving in the military, administrators, nobility and rulers (Kshatriyas).&lt;ref name="Johann Jakob Meyer 90"&gt;{{Citation | title=Sexual life in ancient India: a study in the comparative history of Indian culture | author=Johann Jakob Meyer | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 1989 | isbn=978-81-208-0638-2|page = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudhayana, another ancient vedic scholar, disagrees and writes Gandharva marriage is suitable for most people including merchants and farmers and artisans (Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras), but not for the priest families (Brahmin castes). Baudhayana claims that this is so because Gandharva marriage is based on love and free will. Narada, yet another ancient scholar who wrote [[Nāradasmṛti]] sometime between 100 BC and 400 AD, suggests Gandharva marriage is best for everyone including the Brahmins, calling it ''sadharna''; Narada claims the only methods of marriage that are wrong are those that are based on abduction, violence, fraud or purchase.&lt;ref name="Johann Jakob Meyer 90"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nāradasmṛti xii.44&lt;/ref&gt;

==The decline of Gandharva marriage==
[[File:Hindu Symbolic Marriage.jpg|thumb|Gandharva marriage: couple exchange garlands under a tree. Illustration from [Sougandhika Parinaya] written in [Kannada]]]
There is no consensus theory to explain why Gandharva marriages declined. One theory claims that as prosperity and wealth increased, parents sought greater control of the activities and social life of their children. Another theory claims that after the vedic period when marriageable age for girls was 16 years or higher, social upheavals encouraged child marriages. The social upheavals included those caused by wars between Indian kingdoms, unexpected attacks and attempts to take young women and men as prisoners during waves of attacks from Persia, central Asia and Muslim Sultans/Emperors. With the arrival of Muslim culture and rulers, which itself favored child marriages, the [[Hindu culture]] too shifted to child marriages where the girl was not mature. This practice eliminated the girl's desire or ability to seek men on her accord, meet them, choose and enter into Gandharva marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, Rajbali Pandey (1969), see Chapter VIII, {{ISBN|978-8120803961}}, see pages 163-189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamasutra Of Vatsayana - Richard F. Burton, Penguin Books; {{ISBN|9780143066446}}; see pages 48-51 (Review and Introduction by John Spellman, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the influence of foreign conquest, claims Pandey, Hindu ideology shifted from diversity of marriage types to where the social pressures compelled the girl's family to seek arranged early marriages. Yet another theory is that the priestly caste of India, who officiated Brahma marriages and religious ceremonies, over time crafted rules that declared Gandharva marriage for most Hindus as inappropriate and disapproved (''aprasasta''), because traditional marriages were a source of their income, and Gandharva marriages made them poorer or obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Sexual life in ancient India: a study in the comparative history of Indian culture | author=Johann Jakob Meyer | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 1989 | isbn=978-81-208-0638-2|pages = 94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817 AD, Gandharva marriages in India were ruled legal for some social groups by the Bengal Saddar Court.&lt;ref name="ref17rajix"&gt;{{Citation | title=A treatise on Hindu law and usage | author=John Dawson Mayne | publisher=Higginbotham, 1878 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FwsTAAAAYAAJ | quote=''... The validity of a Gandharva marriage between Kshatriyas appears to have been declared by the Bengal Sudder Court in 1817 ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Justice Abdur Rahim held that the marriage in Gandharva form was not valid in India. This ruling came from the Madras High Court, with the statement that amongst the Hindus, the Gandharva form of marriage was obsolete (as of 1930). This was appealed with the note that the fact that the case is in court is proof that Gandharva weddings among Hindus is not obsolete.&lt;ref name=jm1974/&gt;

In 1946, the Patna High Court in Kamani Devi v. Kameshwar Singh, ILR 25 Pat 58 = (AIR 1946 Pat 316) held that the relationship of husband and wife, created by Gandharva marriage is binding. The husband, the court ruled, cannot escape his responsiability of financially caring for his wife married in Gandharva form. The Patna High Court went further and held that the celebration of Gandharva form of marriage must be attended with nuptial rites and ceremonies including Homa (invocation before the sacred fire) and Saptapadi (the taking of seven steps by the groom and the bride together) for its validity. This ruling was cited in a decision by the Supreme Court in the case of Bhaurao v. State of Maharashtra.

In a 1974 case, Justice Mukherji noted, "Gandharva form of marriage should not be regarded as concubinage or quasi-marital union, more so in the context of the modern Society and in the background of the forward thinking of the present law givers. The possibility of legal validity of this form of marriage in the whole of India in near future even without being backed by custom, is too notorious to be ignored. In a sense, Gandharva form of marriage is trying to come back very fast (in India), pushing parental domination to the background."&lt;ref name=jm1974&gt;[http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1284806/?type=print Ram Chandra Bhattacharjee vs Manju Bhattacharjee on 17 September, 1974], AIR 1975 Cal 118, Judge N.C. Mukherji (Calcutta High Court)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The re-emergence of Gandharva marriage==
In modern India, particularly in urban regions, Gandharva marriage is re-emerging. These type of unions in India are now called ''live in relationship''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianhealthdigest.com/love-marriage-and-indian-society/ Love marriage and Indian Society, Zara (July 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Giri Raj.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">[[Rupa Goswami|Rūpa Gosvāmin]]'s '''{{IAST|Haṃsadūta}}''' (Hansa-duta, हंसदूत) or ''Swan Messenger'' was composed in the early part of the sixteenth century CE. In ''{{IAST|Haṃsadūta}}'' romantic and religious love are combined, to produce a poem that shines with the intensity of love for [[Krishna]], the godhead. It was composed in Bengal by [[Rupa Goswami|Rūpa Gosvāmin]], who was one of the most famous poets of the [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya sampradāya]] established by his contemporary, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]]. The Gaudiyas were devotees of [[Krishna]]. &lt;br /&gt;
In the ''{{IAST|Haṃsadūta}}'' [[Krishna]] has left [[Vrindavan]] for [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], abandoning the many cowherd girls who adore him. Chief among them was [[Radha|Rādhā]], and she is distraught. Her friend Lalitā meets a swan on the banks of the Yamuna and begs him to take a message to [[Krishna]].&lt;br /&gt;
The theme, as of all messenger poems, is viraha, separation in love. Allusions to romance are never far away.&lt;br /&gt;
The journey of the swan in the ''{{IAST|Haṃsadūta}}'' is concluded in 35 of its 142 stanzas, as the distance of swan has to cover is fairly short, from Vrindavan to Mathura. Lalitā’s message takes up over half the poem, and dwells upon the state of the grief-stricken lover, [[Radha|Rādhā]] in this case, while praising her sweetheart&amp;nbsp;– though [[Krishna]] is chided for forsaking the cowherd girls.&lt;br /&gt;
In the ''{{IAST|Haṃsadūta}}'', [[Rupa Goswami|Rūpa Gosvāmin]] uses a number of puns which are ingeniously employed in order to weave the mythology of [[Krishna]] into the work.

==English translations==

The [[Clay Sanskrit Library]] has published a translation of ''{{IAST|Haṃsadūta}}'' by Sir James Mallinson as a part of the volume ''Messenger Poems''.

[[Hinduism]] is a minority religion in [[Belgium]]. There are estimated to be about 6,500 Hindus in the country, which includes 1,500 Hare Krishnas and 5,000 other Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71371.htm IRF2006]&lt;/ref&gt; This does not count [[Buddhist]]s, who are treated as a different religious community by the Belgian government. Hindu religious or monastic orders that are active in Belgium are [[ISKCON]] and the [[Brahma Kumaris]].

There is only one Hindu temple of any size in the country. Spread over 135 acres, the temple was consecrated in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/new-balinese-hindu-temple-in-belgium-brings-stones-halfway-across-the-world/8520.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian community in Belgium==
[[File:Ganesha festival Antwerp6.jpg|thumb|[[Ganesh Chaturthi]] festival in Antwerp]]

There are about 7,000 people of Indian origin in Belgium.

A section of immigrants from Palanpur district in Gujarat entered the port city of Antwerp to work with the Jewish community in the diamond business, and eventually started their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nriinternet.com/EUROPE/Belgium/DiamondBusiness/index.htm Gujaratis families dominate 60 percent diamond trade in Belgium]&lt;/ref&gt; The Antwerp Indians still form a very tightly knit group and actively celebrate Indian festivals.

Indian software companies like Aricent, HCL, TCS, Daffodil Software Ltd and Infosys have a presence in Belgium.

Some farm labourers and shop-hands, mainly immigrants from North India, have also entered Belgium illegally.&lt;ref name=ch11&gt;[http://indiandiaspora.nic.in/diasporapdf/chapter11.pdf Diaspora - chapter 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian associations in Belgium==

Despite the small size of the community there are several Indian cultural associations. The leading ones are Indo-Belgian Association,&lt;ref name="IBA"&gt;[http://www.inbelg.eu/ Indo-Belgian Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Cultural Centre ASBL&lt;ref&gt;[http://brusselsmandir.com Indian Cultural Centre ASBL]&lt;/ref&gt; and Antwerp India Association.

The Hindu Forum of Belgium (HFB or FHB)&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.webassistant.com/hinduforum/hindu_forum_of_belgium/Home.html HFB]&lt;/ref&gt; was created by Hindu organisations in Belgium. It was launched on 16 March 2007 in Brussels.

A handful of Indians work in the financial institutions based in Luxembourg, which boasts an Indian Association. As in the Netherlands, Belgians regularly adopt children from India.&lt;ref name=ch11&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 250 families engaged in diamond trade in Antwerp. Many of the other Indians living in Belgium are professionals employed with either multinational companies or other professional organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indembassy.be/Bilateral_Belgium.asp Indian community in Belgium]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indo-Belgian Association VZW-ASBL==
Indo-Belgian Association or InBelg&lt;ref name="IBA"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; has emerged as the largest Indian non-profit organization with more than 9000 people in it. The main objective of InBelg is to organize events for, about and around Indians and India-related themes in Belgium and elsewhere. InBelg has eight units which organize city-specific or group-specific events: InBelg Gent, InBelg Brussels, InBelg Leuven, InBelg Antwerp, InBelg Women's Club, InBelg Students Club, See-EU and See-India. InBelg organizes around 60 events throughout the year, including Indian festivals, Bollywood movie shows, food fairs, India-info evenings, trips to various parts of Europe, lectures, Indian cooking lessons, and workshops.

==Nepalese Hindu community in Belgium==
It is estimated that around 6000 Hindu of Nepalese origin live in Belgium. Leuven, Antwerpen, Brussels and Brugge are the major cities where Nepali Hindus live. They organize cultural and religious activities on special occasions each year. The main rituals like Nwaran, Pasni, birthday, Bratabandha, marriage, and Griha prabhesh are performed at their homes. They also organize Devi Puja and Shiva Puja on Navarati and Shivaratri.

The Nepali community has not built a temple yet but they intend to establish it to preserve [[Hindu culture]] and tradition. Shreemad Bhagabat Mahayagya was organized to meet this target but it is still in process. Ram Hari Shasti has contributed his time and effort as a Hindu priest for the Nepalese and Hindu community in Belgium.

==Hindu organizations==

===Sanatan Dharma Sewa Parisad===
This is the oldest Hindu cultural association in Belgium. Different Puja and praying are organized on special occasions like Shivaratri and Shravan month. In recent years, it has been celebrating Shree Krishnastami festival with ISKCON in Durby.

===Jayatu Sanskritam===
The [[Jayatu Sanskritam]] association works to promote Hindu traditional culture in Belgium. It was the main organizer of Shremad Bhagabat Mahapuran held in Leuven in 2011. It was a huge Mahayaga organized for the first time in Belgium and around 5000 devotees actively participated. Other associations like Sai Pariwar Belgium and Sanatan Dharma Sewa Parisad were actively present there.

===Satya Sai Pariwar===
Satya Sai Bhajan Mandali is a Hindu association of Nepalese people in Belgium. They organize Sai Bhajan every Sunday in Leuven, Antwerpen and Oostende. They have also collaborated with Satya Sai Kendra of Brussels.

==ISKCON in Belgium==
The International Society for Krishna Consciousness ([[ISKCON]]) is active in Belgium. An ISKCON temple has been built in Septon-Durbuy and is known as Radhadesh. ISKCON centers have been established in Antwerp and Gent. In other towns, where no such center exists, "local get-together programs" are organized periodically at the homes of private individuals where worship of [[Krishna]] is conducted. This is generally organized on festive occasions like [[Janmashtami]] and [[Deepavali]].

ISKCON has the following activities in Belgium:

* Centre-1: ISKCON Center, [[Antwerpen]], Belgium
* Centre-2: Local Get-together Program, [[Ghent]], Belgium
* Center-3: ISKCON Radhadesh temple, in the Septon neighbourhood of [[Durbuy]]. This is the only proper ISKCON temple in Belgium. It includes:
** The main temple, a grand structure where daily worship is performed and festivals are celebrated
** Bhaktivedanta Library Services (BLS), a substantial library and research facility
** [[Bhaktivedanta College]], a religious denomination educational campus, the only Hindu [[Vaishnava]] university in Belgium
** Radhadesh Govinda, the local edition of ISKCON's [[Hare Krishna Food for Life|Food for Life]] program

==Balinese Hinduism==
[[File:Paradisio gen.JPG|thumb|Kingdom of [[Ganesha]]]]

Two Balinese Temples exist in the [[Pairi_Daiza#Other_attractions|Pairi Daiza]] botanical garden in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pairidaiza.eu/en/activities/the-big-balinese-temple&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pairidaiza.eu/en/activities/pura-bunga-the-flower-temple&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4-hectare (9.9-acre) Kingdom of Ganesha, which was opened in 2009, is the largest Indonesian garden in Europe, and reproduces the plant life and feel of the Indonesian archipelago , particularly [[Bali]]. Its collections include [[Pura Agung Shanti Buwana]] Balinese Hindu temple, [[East Nusa Tenggara]] and [[Toraja]] traditional houses and miniature replicas of [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temples. In August 2009 the Indonesian government has sent a pair of Sumatran elephants to enliven the Indonesian Park. It is the first endangered animal breeding loan program that Indonesia ever had in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;https://nationaltokens.com/coins/brugelette-pairi-daiza-royaume-de-ganesha-the-temples/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[hairstyle]]s adopted in the Christian tradition''' have been most varied, over history.

==Early Christians==
The paintings in the [[catacombs]] permit the belief that the early Christians simply followed the fashion of their time. The short hair of the men and the braids of the women were, towards the end of the second century, curled, and arranged in tiers, while for women the hair twined about the head over the brow. Particular locks were reserved to fall over the forehead and upon the temples. 

[[Christian iconography]] still proceeds in accordance with types created in the beginning of Christianity. Images of [[Christ]] retain the long  braided locks parted in the middle and flowing to the shoulders. Those of the [[Blessed Virgin]] still wear the veil which conceals a portion of the brow and confines the neck. The [[Orans|Orantes]], which represent the generality of the faithful, have the hair covered by a full veil which falls to the shoulders. [[Byzantine]] iconography differs little as to head-dress from that of the catacombs. [[Mosaic]]s and ivories portray emperors, bishops, priests and the faithful wearing the hair of a medium length, cut squarely across the forehead. 

Women then wore a round head-dress which encircled the face. Emperors and empresses wore a large, low [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], wide at the top, ornamented with precious stones cut en cabochon, and jeweled [[pendant]]s falling down to the shoulders, such as may be seen in the mosaics of [[S. Vitalis at Ravenna]] and a large number of [[diptych]]s. The hair of [[patriarch]]s and [[bishop]]s was of medium length and was surmounted by a [[closed crown]] or a [[double tiara]].

==Middle Ages==

The invading [[barbarian]]s allowed their hair to grow freely, and to fall unrestrained on the shoulders. After the fall of the [[Merovingians]], and while the invaders were conforming more and more to the prevailing Byzantine taste or fashion, they did not immediately take up the fashion of cutting the hair. [[Carloman I|Carloman]], the brother of [[Charlemagne]], is represented at the age of fourteen with his hair falling in long locked tresses behind. 

Church councils regulated the head-dress of clerics and monks: according to [[St. Jerome]]'s testimony, the monks were bearded, and the ''Vita Hilarionis'' also states that certain persons considered it meritorious to cut hair each year at [[Easter]]. The ''Statuta antiqua Ecclesiae'' (can. xliv) forbade them to allow hair or beard to grow. A synod held by [[St. Patrick]] (can. vi) in 456 prescribed that the clerics should dress their hair in the manner of the Roman clerics, and those who allowed their hair to grow were expelled from the Church (can. x). The [[Council of Agde]] (506) authorized the archdeacon to employ force in cutting the hair of recalcitrants; the [[Council of Braga]] (572) ordained that the hair should be short, and the ears exposed. The [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] (633) denounced the lectors in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] who wore a small [[tonsure]] and allowed the hair to grow immoderately, and two [[Council of Rome|Councils of Rome]] ([[Synod of Rome (721)|721]] and 743) [[anathematized]] those who should neglect the regulations in this matter. 

In the ninth century there is more distinction between freemen and slaves, as regards the hair. Henceforth the slaves were no longer shorn save in punishment for certain offences. Under [[Louis the Débonnaire]] and [[Charles the Bald]] the hair was cut on the temples and the back of the head. In the tenth century the hair cut at the height of the ears fell regularly about the head. At the end of twelfth century the hair was shaven close on the top of the head and fell in long curls behind.

Fashions changed, from hair smooth on the top of the head and rising in a sudden roll in front, a tuft of hair in the form of a flame, or the more ordinary topknot. Not every one followed these fashions.

==Early Modern times==

The clergy followed with a sort of timidity the fashion of the [[wig]], but, except prelates and court chaplains, they refrained from the over-luxurious models. Priests contented themselves with wearing the wig in folio, or square, or the wig à la [[Sartine]]. They bared the part corresponding to the tonsure. In the religious orders, the tonsure very early interposed an obstacle to hairstyles, but the tonsure itself was the occasion of many combinations.

{{Listen|filename=Huron Carol.ogg|title=Huron Carol|description=Tune for ''Huron Carol''}}
The "'''Huron Carol'''" (or "'''Twas in the Moon of Wintertime'''") is a Canadian [[Christmas]] [[hymn]] (Canada's oldest Christmas song), written probably in 1642 by [[Jean de Brébeuf]], a [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] at [[Sainte-Marie among the Hurons]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J. McGee, ''The Music of Canada'' (New York and London: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1985): 13. {{ISBN|0-393-02279-X}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-393-95376-9}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; Brébeuf wrote the lyrics in the [[Wyandot language|native language]] of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]/[[Wyandot people|Wendat]] people; the song's original Huron title is "'''Jesous Ahatonhia'''" ("''Jesus, he is born''"). The song's melody is based on a traditional French [[folk music|folk]] song, "[[Une Jeune Pucelle]]" ("A Young Maid"). The well-known English lyrics were written in 1926 by [[Jesse Edgar Middleton]], and the copyright to these lyrics was held by The Frederick Harris Music Co., Limited, but entered the public domain in 2011.

The English version of the hymn uses imagery familiar in the early 20th century, in place of the traditional [[Nativity play|Nativity]] story. This version is derived from Brébeuf's original song and Huron religious concepts. In the English version, [[Jesus]] is born in a "lodge of broken bark" and wrapped in a "robe of rabbit skin". He is surrounded by hunters instead of [[shepherd]]s, and the [[Magi]] are portrayed as "chiefs from afar" who bring him "fox and beaver pelts" instead of the more familiar [[gold]], [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]]. The English translation uses a traditional [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] name, [[Gitche Manitou|Gitchi Manitou]], for [[God the Father|God]], which is not in the original Wyandot version. The original lyrics are now sometimes modified to use imagery accessible to Christians who are not familiar with [[indigenous peoples in Canada|aboriginal Canadian]] cultures.

The song remains a common Christmas hymn in Canadian churches of many Christian denominations. It is also found in several American hymnals, including ''The Hymnal 1982'' of The Episcopal Church (#114), The United Methodist Hymnal (#244) and Evangelical Lutheran Worship (#284).

Because the melody spans a modest range, it is ideally suited to instruments that have a limited pitch range, such as the [[Native American flute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flutopedia.com/song_huron_carol.htm |title=The Huron Carol - Sheet Music for the Native American Flute |author=Clint Goss |work=Flutopedia |year=2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==

The song was included, as "Jesous Ahatonia", on [[Burl Ives]]'s 1952 album ''[[Christmas Day in the Morning]]'' and was later released as a Burl Ives single under the title "Indian Christmas Carol". [[Bruce Cockburn]] has also recorded a rendition of the song in the original Huron. [[Tom Jackson (actor)|Tom Jackson]] performed this song during his annual ''[[Huron Carole]]'' tour. [[Crash Test Dummies]] did it on their 2002 album, ''Jingle all the Way''. A haunting choral arrangement by R. Anderson was included on the 1997 album ''The Mystery of Christmas'', by the Canadian group the Elora Festival Singers. The music has been rearranged by [[Loreena McKennitt]] under the title "Breton Carol" in 2008. A new recording with a very mystical setting of the Huron Carol was released in 2011 performed by [[The Canadian Tenors]]. In 2001, Terry McDade and [[The McDades]] recorded a version featuring Indian [[bansuri]] on their Free Radio Records release "Midwinter". In 2002, Heather Dale released a trilingual version (Wendat [Huron], French, English) on her ''This Endris Night'' album, updated in 2017 as a YouTube video with an American Sign Language translation. Dale uses a very different English translation, attributed to Father H. Kierans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heatherdale.com/store/index.php?dispatch=products.view&amp;product_id=30018 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110020325/http://heatherdale.com/store/index.php?dispatch=products.view&amp;product_id=30018 |archivedate=November 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2017}} [[Sarah McLachlan]] recorded the song on her 2016 holiday album, ''[[Wonderland (Sarah McLachlan album)|Wonderland]]'', released on the October 21, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/wonderland-mw0002979801|title=Wonderland - Sarah McLachlan - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===
The 1926 English version by Jesse Edgar Middleton.

&lt;poem&gt;
'Twas in the moon of winter-time
When all the birds had fled,
That mighty [[Gitchi Manitou]]
Sent angel choirs instead;
Before their light the stars grew dim,
And wandering hunters heard the hymn:
"Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born,
In excelsis gloria."

Within a lodge of broken bark
The tender Babe was found,
A ragged robe of rabbit skin
Enwrapp'd His beauty round;
But as the hunter braves drew nigh,
The angel song rang loud and high...
"Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born,
In excelsis gloria."

The earliest moon of wintertime
Is not so round and fair
As was the ring of glory
On the helpless infant there.
The chiefs from far before him knelt
With gifts of fox and beaver pelt.
Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born,
In excelsis gloria.

O children of the forest free,
O sons of Manitou,
The Holy Child of earth and heaven
Is born today for you.
Come kneel before the radiant Boy
Who brings you beauty, peace and joy.
"Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born,
In excelsis gloria."
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Ibrahim George Kheiralla''' (11 November 1849 - 6 March 1929) was a founder of the first American [[Bahá'í]] community along with Anton Haddad. He was born to a Christian family in a village on [[Mount Lebanon]] in 1849 and later studied medicine at the [[Syrian Protestant College]] in Beirut.&lt;ref name="browne:kheiralla"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Browne| first = Edward G. | year = 1918| author-link = Edward Granville Browne | title =Materials for the study of the Bábí religion | publisher = Digitally Reprinted.

==Conversion and emigration==
Ibrahim George Kheiralla converted to the [[Bahá'í Faith in Egypt|Bahá'í Faith]] while living in Egypt in 1889 when he met Hájí `Abdu’l-Karím-i-Tihrání.  Kheiralla went through Europe and eventually came to the United States in late 1892 where he joined Anton Haddad, the first Bahá'í to come to America.&lt;ref name=Stockmanv1&gt;{{cite book

In 1894 Kheiralla moved on to Chicago following the interest fostered by the [[World's Columbian Exposition]]'s [[World Parliament of Religions]]. In Chicago he taught  "Truth Seeker" classes.  One of the early converts while Kheiralla was in Chicago was [[Thornton Chase]], who had read the presentation about the Bahá'ís at the Exposition, and is generally considered the first Bahá'í convert in the West.  Other individuals had converted, but none remained members of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stockman |first=Robert H. | authorlink= Robert Stockman |date= 2001 |title=Thornton Chase: First American Bahá'í |url= http://www.bahai-library.org/books/t.chase/ |chapter-url= http://www.bahai-library.org/books/t.chase/ch.chapt11.html |chapter= The Search Ends |location= Wilmette  |publisher= Baha'i Publishing Trust |page= |isbn=978-0877432821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher [[Robert Stockman]] considers Chase's importance as an early North American Bahá’í thinker, publicist, administrator, and organizer is still underappreciated and that in many ways Chase’s death left a gap in the North American Bahá’í community that remained unfilled until the rise to prominence in the early 1920s of [[Horace Holley (Bahá'í)|Horace Holley]], the chief developer of Bahá’í organization in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Pilgrimage and return to America==
In 1898, Kheiralla undertook a [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] to Palestine to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá with other American pilgrims, including [[Phoebe Hearst]], [[Lua Getsinger]] and [[May Maxwell|May Boles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sandra Hutchinson|author2=Richard Hollinger | editor-last =Keller| editor-first = Rosemary Skinner | editor2-last = Ruether | editor2-first =Rosemary Radford | editor3-last =Cantlon | editor3-first = Marie |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America: Native American creation stories | chapter =Women in the North American Baha'i Community | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=WPILfbtT5tQC&amp;pg=PA776 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPILfbtT5tQC|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-34687-8|pages=776–786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Nakhjavani, Violette |year=1996|title=Maxwells of Montreal, The |publisher = George Ronald | location= |isbn=978-0-85398-551-8| page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Hearsts | first = Judith | last = Robinson | publisher = University of Delaware Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-87413-383-1 | pages = 311–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Akka, Kheiralla witnessed first hand the conflict between `Abdu'l-Bahá and his [[Bahá'u'lláh's family|brothers]].  Upon his return to America in 1899, Kheiralla began to announce his avowed leadership of Western Bahá'ís independent of `Abdu'l-Bahá&lt;ref name=Stockmanv1/&gt; and authored a book, ''Beha'u'llah'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kheiralla |first=Ibrahim George |date=1900 |title=Beha 'u'llah |url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/K-O/K/kheiralla/Behaullah.htm |location=Chicago |publisher= Reprinted.

Early after the return to America, `Abdu'l-Bahá sent, first, Anton Haddad with a letter contesting the definition of leadership, then Khieralla's initial teacher of the religion, `Abdu’l-Karím-i-Tihrání, to confront him.&lt;ref name=Stockmanv1/&gt; The conflict made the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite news

==Muslim buildings in Slovenia==
[[File:Mošeja-Log pod Mangartom4.jpg|right|thumb|260px|An old Austro-Hungarian Mosque in Log pod Mangartom, pulled down after World War I]]
There was a mosque in [[Log pod Mangartom]], a village now in the extreme northwest of Slovenia, [[Log pod Mangartom Mosque]], built by the [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry Regiment No. 4]] during World War I and probably demolished soon after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.logpodmangartom.si/dzamija.pdf |title=Džamija |language=Slovenian|trans-title=The Mosque |first=Husein |last=Sejko Mekanović |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, works begun to build a mosque in Ljubljana, to be completed in 2016.

===Ljubljana Mosque===
In September 2013 the foundation stone was laid for a mosque to be 70% funded by Qatar 44 years after the a petition was filed to build a mosque. The mosque will include a cultural centre at a cost of US$16 million to be completed in 2016 with construction commencing in November. The groundbreaking was attended by Prime Minister [[Alenka Bratušek]] who said the building would be a "symbolic victory against all forms of religious intolerance" and that Europe would not be as culturally rich without Islam. There were about 10,000 others in attendance including Ljubljana Mayor [[Zoran Janković (politician)|Zoran Jankovic]] and an unnamed government minister from Qatar. Slovenia's highest Islamic authority Mufti [[Nedzad Grabus]] said: "We are happy to be starting this civic project in Ljubljana, which will thus become a better-known and a more pluralistic city."&lt;Ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/09/2013914161756283157.html&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was also attended by the Bosniak member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina [[Bakir Izetbegović]]. Other attendees were former President of Slovenia [[Danilo Turk]] and Mufti of the Islamic Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina [[Hussein Kavazovic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=haber&amp;ArticleID=117944&lt;/ref&gt; The project had faced administrative hurdles and was a political risk in a majority Roman Catholic country. It also faced a possible referendum on the matter in 2004 with 12,000 signatures for it; however, the [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia]] rejected the petition on the grounds of [[freedom of religion]]. It was also controversial due to the financial crisis afflicting the country. At the ceremony, there was also a rare sight of women in headscarves.&lt;ReF&gt;http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/09/14/uk-slovenia-mosque-idUKBRE98D07A20130914&lt;/ref&gt;

Lalit Shah, its Vice President in 1980, suggested establishment of an umbrella organization of all the Jain organizations in North America. At that time about 15 Jain organizations were in existence, including the [[Jain Center of America]], Jain Meditation International Center founded by [[Chitrabhanu]], International Mahavir Jain Mission founded by [[Sushil Kumar (Jain monk)|Sushil Kumar]], and Jain centers in [[Boston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluralism.org/affiliates/student/piliavsky/index.php |title=The Pluralism Project at Harvard University |publisher=Pluralism.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chicago. The plan for JAINA was conceptualized at the first Jain Convention held in [[Los Angeles]] in 1981, and formalized at the second Jain Convention in [[New York, New York|New York]] in 1983, with the advice and approval of Chitrabhanu and Sushil Kumar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Indian Muslims |url=http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2007/jul/08/jain_convention_new_jersey_draws_thousands.html |title=Jain convention in New Jersey draws thousands &amp;#124; Indian Muslims |publisher=Indianmuslims.info |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kunala Stupa''' is a Buddhist [[stupa]] and [[vihara|monastery]] complex to the south-east of [[Taxila]], on a hill about 200 meters just south of [[Sirkap]],Punjab, [[Pakistan]], thought to date to the 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name=JHM&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=Sir John Hubert |title=Taxila: An Illustrated Account of Archaeological Excavations |date=1951 |publisher=CUP Archive |page=348 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9s8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on a hill overlooking the ancient [[Indo-Greek]] city of [[Sirkap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boda |first1=Sharon La |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania |date=1995 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9781884964046 |page=807 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqHPpNaZfNwC&amp;pg=PA807 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Libertas''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Liberty'') is the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] and [[Liberty (goddess)|embodiment of liberty]].

== Temples and derived inspirations ==

The [[Roman Republic]] was established simultaneously with the creation of Libertas and is associated with the overthrow of the [[Tarquinia (gens)|Tarquin kings]]. She was worshiped by the [[Junia (gens)|Junii]], the family of [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Catholic Quarterly Review ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJkNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA589|year=1880|publisher=Hardy and Mahony|page=589}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 238 BC, before the [[Second Punic War]], [[Tiberius Gracchus]] built a temple to Libertas on the [[Aventine Hill]].&lt;ref name="GalinskyLapatin2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karl Galinsky|author2=Kenneth Lapatin|title=Cultural Memories in the Roman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oW5dCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA230|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-1-60606-462-7|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Census tables were stored inside the temple's atrium. A subsequent temple was built (58–57 BC) on [[Palatine Hill]], another of the [[Seven hills of Rome]], by [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. By building and consecrating the temple on the site of the former house of then-exiled [[Cicero]], Claudius ensured that the land was legally uninhabitable. Upon his return, Cicero successfully argued that the consecration was invalid and thus managed to reclaim the land and destroy the temple. In 46 BC, the Roman Senate voted to build and dedicate a shrine to Libertas in recognition of [[Julius Caesar]], but no temple was built; instead, a small statue of the goddess stood in the [[Roman Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1389461/Libertas |title=Libertas |year=2008 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertas, along with other Roman goddesses, has served as the inspiration for many modern-day symbols, including the [[Statue of Liberty]] on [[Liberty Island]] in the United States. According to the National Park Service, the Statue's Roman robe is the main feature that invokes Libertas and the symbol of Liberty from which the Statue derives its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/stli/teachercorner/page13.html |title=Robe |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, money throughout history has borne the name or image of Libertas. Libertas was pictured on [[Galba]]'s "Freedom of the People" coins during his short reign after the death of [[Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artgallery.yale.edu/pdf/perspect/roman_coins.pdf |format=PDF |title=Roman Coins |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031072838/http://artgallery.yale.edu/pdf/perspect/roman_coins.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of North Carolina records two instances of private banks in its state depicting Libertas on their banknotes;&lt;ref name="Howgego1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Howgego|first=C. J.|authorlink=Christopher Howgego|title=Ancient history from coins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RvEEynd4ZiQC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=1995|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-08993-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dc.lib.unc.edu/u?/numismatics,503 |title=Bank of Fayetteville one-dollar note, 1855 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertas is depicted on the 5, 10 and 20 [[Rappen]] denomination coins of [[Switzerland]].

The Greek equivalent of the goddess Libertas is [[Eleutheria]], the personification of liberty.

== Symbols of Libertas ==
[[File:Zwanzigrappen (cropped).jpg|thumb|Libertas is depicted on coins from several countries, such as the [[coins of the Swiss franc|Swiss twenty-cent coin]] depicted here.]]

As "[[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]]", Libertas was depicted on the obverse (heads side) of most coinage in the U.S. into the twentieth century.

The goddess Libertas is also depicted on the [[Great Seal of France]], created in 1848. This is the image which later influenced French sculptor [[Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi]] in the creation of his statue of [[Liberty Enlightening the World]].

Libertas was associated with the [[Pileus (hat)|pileus]], commonly worn by the freed slave:&lt;ref name="sacred"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Karen |last1=Tate |first2=Brad |last2=Olson | title = Sacred Places of Goddess: 108 Destinations | publisher = CCC Publishing | year = 2005 | location =  | pages = 360–361 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b7KbLLjzuRgC | isbn = 1-888729-11-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Among the Romans the cap of felt was the emblem of liberty'''. When a slave obtained his freedom he had his head shaved, and wore instead of his hair an undyed pileus (πίλεον λευκόν, [[Diodorus Siculus]] Exc. Leg. 22 p625, ed. Wess.; [[Plautus|Plaut.]] Amphit. I.1.306; [[Persius]], V.82). Hence the phrase ''servos ad pileum vocare'' is a summons to liberty, by which slaves were frequently called upon to take up arms with a promise of liberty ([[Livy|Liv.]] XXIV.32). '''The figure of Liberty on some of the coins of [[Antoninus Pius]], struck A.D. 145, holds this cap in the right hand'''.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, James. Entry "Pileus" in William Smith's ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' ([[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], London, 1875).&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertas was also recognized in ancient Rome by the rod (''vindicta'' or ''festuca''),&lt;ref name="sacred" /&gt; used ceremonially in the act of ''Manumissio vindicta'', Latin for "Freedom by the Rod" (emphasis added):

:The master brought his slave before the [[magistratus]], and stated the grounds ([[causa]]) of the intended manumission. '''The lictor of the magistratus laid a rod ([[festuca]]) on the head of the slave, accompanied with certain formal words, in which he declared that he was a free man ex Jure Quiritium''', that is, "vindicavit in libertatem". The master in the meantime held the slave, and after he had pronounced the words "hunc hominem liberum volo," he turned him round (momento turbinis exit Marcus Dama, Persius, Sat. V.78) and let him go (emisit e manu, or misit manu, Plaut. Capt. II.3.48), whence the general name of the act of manumission. The magistratus then declared him to be free [...]&lt;ref&gt;Long, George. Entry "[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Manumissio.html Manumission]" in William Smith's ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'' (John Murray, London, 1875).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personifications==
The symbolic characters [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] who represents the United States and [[Marianne]], who represents France, the [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York Harbor]] and many other characters and concepts of the modern age were created, and are seen, as embodiments of Libertas.

'''Liborio Zerda''' ([[Bogotá]], [[Republic of New Granada]], 10 July 1834 (other sources state 1830 or 1833)&lt;ref name=BancoZerda/&gt;&lt;ref name=BancoZerda2&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/category/autores-dccreator/zerda-liborio-1833-1919 Liborio Zerda] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt; - Bogotá, Colombia, 9 November 1919) was a [[Colombia]]n [[physician]] and [[List of Muisca scholars|Muisca scholar]]. Zerda has been important in the natural sciences of the late 19th and early 20th century in Colombia, publishing many articles about various topics, from medicine to chemical analysis, radioactivity and the popular drink [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]].&lt;ref name=BancoZerda&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/biografias/zerdlibo.htm Biography Liborio Zerda] - [[Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda&gt;{{es}} [https://encolombia.com/libreria-digital/lmedicina/humanismo/humanismo-liboriozerda/ Doctor Liborio Zerda]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerda was contemporaneous with other Muisca scholars, and influenced by them; [[Joaquín Acosta]] and [[Ezequiel Uricoechea]]. He analysed the work done by [[José Domingo Duquesne]] on the [[Muisca numerals]] and published in 1883 his major work ''El Dorado'' about the [[Muisca mythology|mythical]] ''[[El Dorado]]'', that he situated not in [[Lake Guatavita]] as is currently accepted to have been the site of the inauguration of the new ''[[zipa]]'', but in the [[Siecha Lakes]] in the [[Chingaza Natural National Park]].

Liborio Zerda taught at the ''Colegio del Rosario'' in Bogotá for 60 years and died on November 9, 1919 in the Colombian capital.

== Biography ==
Liborio Zerda was born on July 10, 1830, 1833 or 1834 in the capital of the then [[Republic of New Granada]], Bogotá. He attended the ''Colegio de San Bartolomé'', a strict school that prohibited their students to walk on the streets at night, enter houses with a bad reputation, playing games or read obscene books. His interest for [[natural science]]s was born at the ''Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Señora del Rosario'', where Zerda, as student of [[Joaquín Acosta]], took classes in [[chemistry]], [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]]. Liborio Zerda studied Medicine at the [[Universidad Central]] in the capital, graduating in 1853. He became a medical practitioner in Bogotá right after finishing his studies and in 1854 gained his specialisation in [[surgery]] and military medicine.&lt;ref name=BancoZerda/&gt;&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt;

After the foundation of the ''Comisión Corográfica'' in 1850, led by Italian [[Agustín Codazzi]], Zerda founded the ''Sociedad Caldas'' in 1855. In 1859 Zerda joined the ''Sociedad de Naturalistas Neogranadinos'', which was founded by Muisca scholar [[Ezequiel Uricoechea]]. In this society, Liborio Zerda analysed mineralogy, while teaching courses on chemistry and physics. In those times, the studies of natural sciences were not yet well developed in Colombia. Zerda published about the "new" phenomenon of [[radioactivity]].&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt;

In 1865 Zerda founded the ''Escuela de Medicina Privada'', precursor of present-day private medicine schools. During the first years of this school, Zerda published about [[coca]] and [[opium]] use in Bogotá (''Estudios sobre la Coca y el Opio bogotano''), drinking water analysis (''Análisis de las aguas potables de Bogotá'') and oils (''Método para blanquear y purificar los aceites grasos''). A year later, he published his first book, about horse medicine; ''Hipiátrica, tratado de medicina del caballo''.&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt;

1867 was the year of foundation of the [[National University of Colombia|Universidad Nacional]], that housed a faculty on natural sciences (''Escuela de Ciencias Naturales''). Zerda published about the chemical analysis, mainly of [[halite|salt]], common on the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], with works titled ''Análisis de sal gema, sal compactada, sal cristalizada y de agua de las principales fuentes salinas de la República'', ''Determinación de la presencia del iodo en el pescado del río Funza'', ''Análisis químico y estudio de las aplicaciones medicinales de varias aguas minerales naturales'' and ''Análisis sobre muestras de hulla de la Sabana de Bogotá, Zipaquirá y Riohacha''. For this publication, Zerda was awarded the ''Medalla de Oro en la Exposición Nacional''.&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt; In 1891 Zerda wrote the ''Catálogo de la colección mineralógica'' and published about [[snake venom]].&lt;ref name=BancoZerda/&gt;

During the later 19th century, Zerda published about [[Chicha#Colombia|chicha]], the [[Muisca cuisine|alcoholic beverage]] of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] that was popular at the time, with a publication called ''Estudio químico patológico e higiénico de la chicha, bebida popular en Colombia''. He also wrote about ions, electrons and [[radium]] (''El radium y sus propiedades maravillosas'') and the illnesses flies spread (''Las moscas transmisoras de enfermedad''). His work on chicha revealed the danger of [[maize]] infected with a fungus.&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt;

Zerda died on November 9, 1919 in his city of birth Bogotá.&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt;

=== About the Muisca ===
The interests of the intellectual Zerda were not restricted to the natural sciences. He published papers about the [[Muisca history|history]] of the Muisca, their habits, traditions and [[Muisca religion|religion]]. His book ''El Dorado'', published in 1883 and reprinted in 1947, is one of the first [[anthropology|anthropological]], historical and ethnographical studies on the original inhabitants of the [[Bogotá savanna]] and northern areas of the Altiplano.&lt;ref name=BancoZerda/&gt;&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt;

Liborio Zerda analysed the work by [[José Domingo Duquesne]] who in 1795 had written about the [[Chibcha language|language]] and [[Muisca numerals|numerals]] of the Muisca. The Chibcha language was almost extinct by the late 19th century and the revival of it by Zerda has aided in later analyses of the language.&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt;

On the Muisca numerals, Zerda discovered the importance of [[frogs]] in the Muisca culture. He stated that the frog represented the times of draught on the Altiplano. An extended frog or one without legs symbolises rest, happiness and the [[Muisca agriculture|harvests]]. Frogs with a human head stand for intelligence. An eagle with a frog in its claws symbolised summer.&lt;ref&gt;Bohórquez, 2008, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; The frog was known from the [[Muisca calendar]], that was first analysed by Duquesne. Zerda theorised that the well-known publication of Duquesne (''Disertación sobre el origen del calendario y jeroglíficos de los moscas'') was merely a summary of the larger work ''Anillo astronóomico de los moscas''.&lt;ref&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; Zerda did not analyse the work done on the Muisca calendar by famous naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who met Duquesne in Colombia in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Liborio Zerda wrote about a stone that represented the calendar, a similar stone as the [[Choachí Stone]], which was found later. It has been thought possible by researcher [[Manuel Arturo Izquierdo Peña]] that the stone Zerda described was actually a mould used in the famous goldworking of the Muisca, to produce ''[[tunjo]]s''.&lt;ref name=Izquierdo_p84&gt;Izquierdo Peña, 2009, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later chapters of ''El Dorado'', Zerda draws comparisons between the origins of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] with Africa and Asia, based on metalworking and [[ceramic]]s. In his work, he described the ritual of ''[[El Dorado]]'' in sacred [[Lake Guatavita]], represented in the golden [[Muisca raft]], which was found after Zerda's death in [[Pasca]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]].&lt;ref name=EnColombiaZerda/&gt; The book also treats other indigenous tribes of Colombia, such as the [[Panche people|Panche]] and others and formed the basis for the 20th century anthropological studies of the Muisca.&lt;ref name=BancoZerda/&gt;

In the view of Zerda, the Muisca were a [[neolithic]] culture and their [[Muisca architecture#roads|ancient roads]] were built by an earlier, superior civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 2005, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; Deeply influenced by the ethnological works of [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Lubbock]], [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|De Mortillet]] and [[Paul Broca|Broca]], Zerda proposed a long chronology of the history of the Muisca. He defended the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|period of Spanish conquest]] to educate the primitive Muisca to a higher level. Zerda proposed the sacred [[Siecha Lakes]] were the actual site of ''El Dorado'', later found to have been [[Lake Guatavita]].&lt;ref&gt;Guarín Martínez, 2005, p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

Liborio Zerda's research revealed the diet of the Muisca people was formed by the deer species ''[[Cervus virginianus]]'', ''[[Cervus mexicanus]]'' and ''[[Cervus simplicicomis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; and fish from the [[Funza River|Funza]] and other [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense#Rivers|rivers]] (''[[Eremophilus mutisii]]'' and ''[[Grundulus bogotensis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, pp.110-111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bohórquez, 2008, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; The fish provided a source of [[iodine]] for the Muisca.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez &amp; Manrique, 2014, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, Zerda described a [[Muisca mummification|mummy]] of a young girl, found in a cave on the Toquilla [[paramo]] within the municipality of [[Aquitania, Boyacá|Aquitania]], at {{convert|4000|m|ft}} altitude. The mummy was decorated with golden objects and wrapped in cotton mantles. The body was organised in a [[squatting position]].&lt;ref&gt;Martínez &amp; Martínez, 2012, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote about [[Cuchavira]], god of the rainbow of the Muisca.&lt;ref&gt;Villa Posse, 1993, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enochian angels''' are entities described in the [[Enochian magic]] system, introduced in the sixteenth century by [[John Dee]] (1527–1608) and [[Edward Kelley]] (1555–1597).

==History==
John Dee was born a Christian, and this can be seen throughout his journals and his "Enochian" system of Angel Magic.  Therein, we find an obvious belief in the [[Trinity]] (Father, Son and Holy Spirit).  We also find a fourth Supreme Being in the figure of "Galvah" (Omega) &amp;mdash; who is also called the Mother, Wisdom and "I AM" in Dee's journals.  This figure is known in Judaism as the [[Shekhinah]] &amp;mdash; Divine Presence; to the Gnostics as [[Sophia (name)|Sophia]] &amp;mdash; Wisdom; and to the Hermetic Qabalah as Aima Elohim &amp;mdash; Mother of the gods. Compare [[Theotokos]], Mother of God, in Catholic beliefs.

Beneath these four Divinities are several hierarchies of [[angel]]s, or intelligent rulers, set over such things as the Planets, the Stars and the four Quarters of the Earth.

The angels of the four quarters are symbolized by the "Watchtowers" &amp;mdash; four large magical word-square Tables (collectively called the [[Great Table of the Earth]]).  Most of the well-known Enochian Angels are drawn from the Watchtowers of the Great Table.

Each of the four Watchtowers is collectively governed by six Seniors (aka Elders) &amp;mdash; making a total of 24 Elders as seen in the [[Revelation of St. John]].  Each Watchtower is further divided into four sub-quadrants, where we find the names of various Archangels and Angels who govern the quarters of the world.  In this way, the entire universe, visible and invisible, is teeming with living intelligences.

==The angelic names contained in the Watchtowers==
The names of the Enochian angels are drawn from a number of enciphered tables, received through the "spirit actions" of John Dee, Edward Kelly, and occasionally another scryer.  The Watchtower set of angels is one of the larger and better developed sets.  A problem arises in that there are several variations on the Watchtowers themselves and several ways of drawing the names therefrom.  The four Watchtowers were first received on 25 June 1584.  This arrangement and order is reflected in Dee's prayer - The Fundamental Obeisance.  They were then rearranged slightly and corrected in the days following: 26 June through 2 July 1584; this arrangement corresponds to the majority of prayers in Sloane MS. 3191 (The Book of Earthly Victory and Science) and is what is given in the published versions of that text, notably Geoffrey James' ''Enochian Evocation'' / ''Magick'' and Robert Turner's ''Elizabethan Magic''. Late in the course of Dee and Kelly's work together, on 19 April 1587, the [[Archangel Raphael]], was said to have appeared, and reformed the Watchtowers, rearranging their order and directions and making some minor corrections.  It is this arrangement that is used in the Golden Dawn and subsequent derivatives such as [[Thelema]], [[Wicca]] and the [[Church of Satan]]. The Golden Dawn also follows a slightly different method of drawing forth some of the names from the Tables. The Golden Dawn method of extracting the names, is heavily influenced by the post Dee text contained in Sloane MS. 307 and published by Stephen Skinner and David Rankine as ''Practical Angel Magic of Dr John Dee's Enochian Tables''.  For convenience sake, in identifying these variations when they differ, the received set is labelled Received, the set reflected in Sloane MS. 3191 is labelled Orthodox, the set reformed by Raphael as Reformed and the variations used by the Golden Dawn as GD. The Angelic Hierarchies of the Watchtowers are also set out in several visions of Edward Kelly's and enshrined in a Talisman constructed by John Dee, published in ''A True &amp; Faithful Relation'' and on display in the [[British Museum]] collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">'''Matthew 3:14''' is the fourteenth verse of the third chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]]. [[Jesus]] has come to [[John the Baptist]] to be baptized, but in this verse John balks at doing so.

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
: But John forbad him, saying, 
: I have to need to be baptized of 
:thee, and comest thou to me?

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
: But John would have hindered 
: him, saying, "I need to be baptized 
: by you, and you come to me?"

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=2:23&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 3:14]

Gundry notes that this section does not appear in Luke or Mark and concludes that it is thus likely original to Matthew. In the environment the author of Matthew is presumed to have been writing in there would still have been many followers of John the Baptist who felt he was equal or superior to Jesus. Matthew is thus very careful to specify the relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Albright and Mann state that this verse and the next are often seen as an embarrassed attempt to justify the messiah being baptized by a mere mortal.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, W.F.]] and C.S. Mann. "Matthew." ''[[The Anchor Bible Series]].'' New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The verse does not specify why exactly John believes he is the one to be baptized. Based on [[Matthew 3:11]] most scholars feel it is mainly an issue of precedence. However, according to Hill the [[Gospel of the Nazarenes],] adds a clarification to this section stating that it was because of Jesus' sinlessness that John felt he was the one who should be baptized.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, David. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In John the order of events is different, and the Baptist only recognizes Jesus' nature after the baptism.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. T. France|France, R.T.]]. ''The Gospel of Matthew.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 pg. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3491">'''Matthew 6:6''' is the sixth verse of the sixth chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]] and is part of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]. This verse continues the discussion on the proper procedure for [[praying]]; that is, not to do it in public, but to do it in private.

In the [[King James Version]] of the [[Bible]] the text reads:
:But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy 
:closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray 
:to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father 
:which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:But you, when you pray, enter into your inner
:chamber, and having shut your door, pray to 
:your Father who is in secret, and your Father 
:who sees in secret will reward you openly.

For a collection of other versions see [http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=6:6&amp;src=! BibRef Matthew 6:6]

After condemning ostentatious prayer in the previous verse, this verse outlines the proper procedure for praying. As with charitable giving, the true believer should act in secret. 

Theologian [[Eduard Schweizer]] suggests that the room ({{lang-gr|ταμεῖόν}}, ''tameion'') referenced in this verse would have been the storage room. Most of [[Jesus]]' audiences would have lived in homes with only one room, but in Palestine it was common to have a separate storage area with a door to protect foodstuffs. This would have been the only room with a door. Schweizer suggests that this reference has been assimilated to the wording of {{bibleverse||Isaiah|26:20|NKJV}}:
:''Come, my people, enter your chambers, and shut your doors behind you'',&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, Eduard, ''The Good News According to Matthew'', Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

an action which the [[Pulpit Commentary]] associates with "a time of terror".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm Pulpit Commentary] on Matthew 6, accessed 13 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] argues that "every Jewish house had a place for secret devotion" &lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/6.htm Barnes' Notes] on Matthew 6, accessed 13 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; such as a room above the front porch, whereas [[Charles Ellicott]] thought the reference was to "the steward’s closet, in the place which seemed to men least likely, which they would count it irreverent to connect with the idea of prayer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/6.htm Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers] on Matthew 6, accessed 13 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of this verse closely parallels the end of [[Matthew 6:4]]. This verse adds the mention of the [[omnipresent]] God being in secret, as well as being able to see all that is in secret. As with Matthew 6:4, most scholars feel that "openly" is an erroneous addition at the end of this verse.&lt;ref&gt;Luz, Ulrich. ''Matthew 1-7: A Commentary'', trans. Wilhelm C. Linss.

'''Modekngei''', or ''Ngara Modekngei'' (United Sect) is a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religious movement founded around 1915 by [[Temedad]], a native of the island of [[Babeldaob]], that spread throughout [[Palau]]. It rose to political ascendancy between the [[world war]]s and is currently professed by 8.8%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ps.html|title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Palau|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Palau's population.

While only about 8% of Palauans practice Modekngei, a large concentration of that figure reside in the same village. Ibobang, a small town with a population of less than 100 in [[Ngatpang]] state, is a community devoted to the practice of Modekngei.

Modekngei religion is a hybrid of ancient Palauan customs and [[Christianity]]. Followers of the religion believe in the Christian God and recognize [[Jesus Christ]] as the saviour while simultaneously making appeasements to traditional Palauan deities.

The origins of Modekngei are unknown, but one belief is that Modekngei began as a nonviolent opposition to the Japanese occupation and is an amalgamation of native [[animistic]] and [[Christian]] beliefs carried on in an [[oral tradition]] of chants called ''keskes'', tending to reinforce the native culture heritage.

A common story told in Ngatpang is that the religion developed from the efforts of Christian missionaries who came to Palau in hopes to convert the islanders to Christianity. Upon arriving in the village of Ibobang, the missionaries were so taken back by the citizens' commitment to traditional customs that the missionaries made an exception and allowed the Palauans to keep their goddess and still partake in Christianity.

The goal of Modekngei religion is to preserve ancient Palauan traditions in a way that aligns itself with [[Christianity|Christian salvation]].

Modekngei followers in Ibobang practice a traditional lifestyle centered on ancient ideas of family, community, and purity. The religion prohibits followers from all [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and drug use, and children in the village are required to be home by dark and abstain from making loud noises in sacred places.

Citizens of Ibobang attend daily church services. The church building is located in the center of the village and is likewise the center of activity. One of the many Modekngei customs requires members of the community to walk silently to church each morning. To speak, especially loudly, before a church service is disrespectful and borderline [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]. Women in Ibobang usually dress in [[Western world|western]] apparel, but when it comes to church they are required to always wear a skirt or dress when either entering or passing the building. As a result, it’s not uncommon to see a woman in Ibobang dressed in pants to take a longer route to her destination to keep from crossing the church grounds without the proper attire.

Daily Modekngei church services are short, consisting mostly of individual and group [[prayers]]. However, services celebrating both traditional and religious holidays are more elaborate and can last several days with weeks of communal preparation.

One custom that most Palauans observe—regardless of religious affiliation—is the prohibition of any alcohol or [[tobacco]] within the city limits of Ibobang. According to ancient belief, violating this religious law will bring terrible rainstorms upon the village that won’t go away until the [[sin]] has been forgiven by the Modekngei goddess.

Even Palauans who normally partake in such activities will abstain from bringing any banned substances within the city limits. The traditional belief that continuous rain will plague the village is so strong that Modekngei elders will hang fruit and other treats on tree branches throughout the village in hopes of bribing the goddess to be forgiving of outsiders' misconduct.

Another customary activity that takes place in Ibobang is the blessing of the roads. This particular custom coincides with the [[moon cycle|moon’s cycle]]. A few days before each full moon, the community works together to clean the entire village. Lawns are cut, trash is cleaned and houses are scrubbed. Then, the evening before the full moon dawns, everyone who lives in Ibobang waits inside their houses while a village elder walks up and down the streets chanting prayers and blessings over the village. This is a necessary practice in Modekngei because it’s believed that during a full moon, the Modekngei goddess is better able to see the malpractices of her people.

Ibobang is the home of [http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!218545!0 Belau Modekngei School (BMS)], a boarding school for high school students situated at the far end of the village. In 1974, a handful of Modekngei elders realized their desire to pass on the ancient traditions of the Modekngei religion to future generations.

Today, between 25 and 30 students from the 9th to 12th grade are [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Belau-Modekngei-School-Class-of/122304404467760 enrolled at BMS]. Students and faculty have the option of living on campus in traditional dormatory-style housing with no [[electricity]] or [[running water]], or in the surrounding villages of [[Ngatpang]]. Slightly more than half the students live on campus.

The student body at BMS is diverse. Some of the students attend because they come from families who value a traditional education. Other students enroll at BMS as a last resort option. As one of very few private high schools on [[Palau]], BMS has the option of accepting students who have been expelled from the island's [https://web.archive.org/web/20070517090702/http://www.palaumoe.net/phs/html/home.htm one and only public high school].

Students at BMS study core academic subjects such as English, Math and Palauan, but they also take Modekngei religion classes, have the opportunity to farm ancient medicinal crops, and practice traditional customs along with the village.

Belau Modekngei's primary goal is to preserve Modekngei religion for future generations of Palauans.

'''Mor''' (vernacular pronunciation) or '''Mar''' (from {{lang-syc|ܡܪܝ}} ''{{Transl|syr|Mār(y)}}'', written with a silent final [[yodh]]) is a title of respect in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], literally meaning 'my lord'. It is given to all [[saint]]s and is also used before [[Christian name]] of [[bishop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Brock S.

In the second Syriac inscription, Appendix I, the title is used for Bishop Diskoros)»''&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding feminine form given to women saints is '''Mart''' or '''Mort''' ({{Lang-syr|ܡܪܬܝ}}, ''{{Transl|syr|Mārt(y)}}''). The title is placed before the [[Christian name]], as in Mar Aprem/Mor Afrem ([[Ephrem the Syrian]]) and Mart/Mort Maryam ([[Mary, mother of Jesus]]).

The variant ''[[Maran]]'' or ''Moran'' ({{Lang-syr|ܡܪܢ}}, ''{{Transl|syr|Māran}}''), meaning "[[God|Our Lord]]", is a particular title given to [[Jesus]], either alone or in combination with other names and titles. Likewise, ''Martan'' or ''Mortan''  ({{Lang-syr|ܡܪܬܢ}}, ''{{Transl|syr|Mārtan}}'', "Our Lady") is a title of Mary, mother of Jesus.

Occasionally, the term ''Maran'' or ''Moran'' has been used of various Eastern Christian [[patriarch]]s and [[catholicos|catholicoi]]. The [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church|Malankara Orthodox Catholicos]] use the title ''Moran Mor''. Sometimes the Indian bearers of this title are called ''Moran Mar'', using a hybrid style from both Syriac dialects that reflects somewhat the history of Syrian Christians in [[Kerala]]. The [[Pope]] of Rome is referred to as ''Mar Papa'' by the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of [[India]].

The obscure variant ''Marya'' or ''Moryo'' ({{Lang-syr|ܡܪܝܐ}}, ''{{Transl|syr|Māryā}}'') is used in the [[Peshitta]] [[Old Testament]] to render the [[Tetragrammaton]]. Although this word is clearly a derived form of the above, there is a fanciful derivation found in early Syriac lexica, that the word is an [[initialism]] as follows:
*{{Lang|syr|ܡ}} — {{Lang|syr|ܡܪܘܬܐ}}, ''{{Transl|syr|māruṯā}}'', 'lordship'
*{{Lang|syr|ܪ}} — {{Lang|syr|ܪܒܘܬܐ}}, ''{{Transl|syr|rabbuṯā}}'', 'majesty'
*{{Lang|syr|ܝ ܐ}} — {{Lang|syr|ܐܝܬܝܐ}}, ''{{Transl|syr|iṯyā}}'', 'self-existence'
In [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] through to date this Aramaic word is pronounced [mar] ({{lang-he|{{hebrew|מָר}}}}), and it is used as a formal way of addressing or referring to a male person. In the [[Gemara]], [[Tabyomi]] is sometimes referred to as Mar.&lt;ref&gt;Bacher, Wilhelm.  [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14192-tabyomi "Tabyomi."] ''JewishEncyclopedia.com''.  1906.  30 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; "Mar" was also the title of the [[Exilarch]] (leader of the [[Jewish diaspora]] community in Babylon), with the Aramaic-speaking Jews sharing many cultural attributes with the Syriac Christians. In the [[Modern Hebrew]] of contemporary Israel, "Mar" is used without distinction for any male person, like "[[Mr.]]" in English. However, in Rabbanical circles of [[Jews]] from the [[Middle East]], the Aramaic variant form מָרָן (Maran, Aramaic: our lord) is still a title to used for highly appreciated Rabbis, such as [[Ovadia Yosef]], the spiritual leader of the [[Shas]] party.&lt;ref&gt;"The life of Maran Ovadia Yosef, of Blessed and Holy Memory" - Hebrew-language obituary and biography on "Kooker", an Israeli religious news website [http://www.kooker.co.il/%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%A0%D7%A8-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%97-%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%9F-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%A2-%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%98%D7%90/]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of religion}}
'''Myth and ritual''' are two central components of religious practice. Although [[myth]] and [[ritual]] are commonly united as parts of [[religion]], the exact relationship between them has been a matter of controversy among scholars. One of the approaches to this problem is "the myth and ritual, or myth-ritualist, theory," held notably by the so-called [[Cambridge Ritualists]], which holds that "myth does not stand by itself but is tied to ritual."&lt;ref name="Segal61"/&gt; This theory is still disputed; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigms]], but not that one developed from the other.&lt;ref name="Meletinsky117"/&gt;

==Overview==
The "[[myth and ritual school]]" is the name given to a series of authors who have focused their [[philological]] studies on the "ritual purposes of myths."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica entries on [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-400991/Myth-and-Ritual-School Myth and Ritual School (religion)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these scholars (e.g., [[W. Robertson-Smith]], [[James George Frazer]], [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], [[S. H. Hooke]]) supported the "primacy of ritual" hypothesis, which claimed that "every myth is derived from a particular ritual and that the [[syntagmatic]] quality of myth is a reproduction of the succession of ritual act."&lt;ref name="Meletinsky117"&gt;Meletinsky, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the important approaches to the study of [[mythological]] thinking have been those of [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Schiller]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Freud]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Lévi-Strauss]], [[Northrop Frye|Frye]], the [[Soviet school]], and the Myth and Ritual School.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Lanoue, Foreword to Meletinsky, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Soviet researchers such as [[Jakov E. Golosovker]], [[Frank-Kamenecky]], [[Olga Freidenberg]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], "grounded the study of myth and ritual in [[folklore]] and in the [[world view]] of [[popular culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;Meletinsky, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, the [[semantic]] study of myth and ritual, particularly by [[Bill Stanner]] and [[Victor Turner]], has supported a connection between myth and ritual. However, it has not supported the notion that one preceded and produced the other, as supporters of the "primacy of ritual" hypothesis would claim. According to the currently dominant scholarly view, the link between myth and ritual is that they share common [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigms]].&lt;ref name="Meletinsky117"/&gt;

==Ritual from myth==
One possibility immediately presents itself: perhaps ritual arose from myth. Many religious rituals—notably [[Passover]] among Jews, [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] among Christians, and the [[Hajj]] among Muslims—commemorate, or involve commemoration of, events in religious literature.

===E. B. Tylor===
Leaving the sphere of historical religions, the ritual-from-myth approach often sees the relationship between myth and ritual as analogous to the relationship between science and technology. The pioneering anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] is the classic exponent of this view.&lt;ref name="Segal63"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; He saw myth as an attempt to explain the world: for him, myth was a sort of proto-science.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual is secondary: just as technology is an application of science, so ritual is an application of myth—an attempt to produce certain effects, given the supposed nature of the world: "For Tylor, myth functions to explain the world as an end in itself. Ritual applies that explanation to control the world."&lt;ref name="Segal63"/&gt; A ritual always presupposes a preexisting myth: in short, myth gives rise to ritual.

==Myth from ritual (primacy of ritual)==
Against the intuitive idea that ritual reenacts myth or applies mythical theories, many 19th-century anthropologists supported the opposite position: that myth and religious doctrine result from ritual. This is known as the "primacy of ritual" hypothesis.

===William Robertson Smith===
This view was asserted for the first time by the bible scholar [[William Robertson Smith]].&lt;ref name="Meletinsky19"&gt;Meletinsky pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar [[Meletinsky]] notes that Smith introduced the concept "dogmatically."&lt;ref name="Meletinsky19"/&gt; In his ''Lectures on the Religion of the Semites'' (1889), Smith draws a distinction between ancient and modern religion: in modern religion, doctrine is central; in ancient religion, ritual is central.&lt;ref name="Segal61"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, Smith argues, ancients tended to be conservative with regard to rituals, making sure to pass them down faithfully. In contrast, the myths that justified those rituals could change. In fact, according to Smith, many of the myths that have come down to us arose "after the original, nonmythic reason [...] for the ritual had somehow been forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, Smith gives the worship of [[Adonis]]. Worshipers mourned Adonis's mythical death in a ritual that coincided with the annual withering of the vegetation. According to Smith, the ritual mourning originally had a nonmythical explanation: with the annual withering of plants, "the worshippers lament out of natural sympathy [...] just as modern man is touched with melancholy at the falling of autumn leaves."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; Once worshipers forgot the original, nonmythical reason for the mourning ritual, they created "the myth of Adonis as the dying and rising god of vegetation [...] to account for the ritual."&lt;ref name="Segal63"/&gt;

===Stanley Edgar Hyman===
In his essay "The Ritual View of Myth and the Mythic," (1955) Stanley Edgar Hyman makes an argument similar to Smith's:
{{quote|"In Fiji [...] the physical peculiarities of an island with only one small patch of fertile soil are explained by a myth telling how Mberewalaki, a culture hero, flew into a passion at the misbehavior of the people of the island and hurled all the soil he was bringing them in a heap, instead of laying it out properly. Hocart points out that the myth is used aetiologically to explain the nature of the island, but did not originate in that attempt. The adventures of Mberewalaki originated, like all mythology, in ritual performance, and most of the lore of Hocart's Fijian informants consisted of such ritual myths.  When they get interested in the topology of the island or are asked about it, Hocart argues, they do precisely what we would do, which is ransack their lore for an answer."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 68, No. 270, ''Myth: A Symposium'' (1955), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here Hyman argues against the etiological interpretation of myth, which says that myths originated from attempts to explain the origins ([[etiology|etiologies]]) of natural phenomena. If true, the etiological interpretation would make myth older than, or at least independent of, ritual—as E.B. Tylor believes it is. But Hyman argues that people use myth for etiological purposes only after myth is already in place: in short, myths didn't originate as explanations of natural phenomena. Further, Hyman argues, myth originated from ritual performance. Thus, ritual came before myth, and myth depends on ritual for its existence until it gains an independent status as an etiological story.

===James Frazer===
The famous anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] claimed that myth emerges from ritual during the natural process of religious evolution. Many of his ideas were inspired by those of [[Robertson Smith]].&lt;ref name="Meletinsky19"/&gt; In ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890; 1906–1915), Frazer famously argues that man progresses from belief in magic (and rituals based on magic), through belief in religion, to science.&lt;ref name="Frazer711"&gt;Frazer, p. 711''&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is as follows.

Man starts out with a reflexive belief in a natural law. He thinks he can influence nature by correctly applying this law: "In magic man depends on his own strength to meet the difficulties and dangers that beset him on every side. He believes in a certain established order of nature on which he can surely count, and which he can manipulate for his own ends."&lt;ref name="Frazer711"/&gt;

However, the natural law man imagines—namely, magic—does not work. When he sees that his pretended natural law is false, man gives up the idea of a knowable natural law and "throws himself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings behind the veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those far-reaching powers which he once arrogated to himself."&lt;ref name="Frazer711"/&gt; In other words, when man loses his belief in magic, he justifies his formerly magical rituals by saying that they reenact myths or honor mythical beings. According to Frazer,
{{quote|"myth changes while custom remains constant; men continue to do what their fathers did before them, though the reasons on which their fathers acted have been long forgotten. The history of religion is a long attempt to reconcile old custom with new reason, to find a sound theory for an absurd practice."&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Jane Ellen Harrison and S. H. Hooke===
The classicist [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] and the biblical scholar [[S. H. Hooke]] regarded myth as intimately connected to ritual. However, "against Smith," they "vigorously deny" that myth's main purpose is to justify a ritual by giving an account of how it first arose (e.g., justifying the Adonis worshipers' ritual mourning by attributing it to Adonis's mythical death).&lt;ref name="Segal71"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, these scholars think a myth is largely just a narrative description of a corresponding ritual: according to Harrison, "the primary meaning of myth ... is the spoken correlative of the acted rite, the thing done."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison; quoted in Segal (no specific text cited), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison and Hooke gave an explanation for why ancients would feel the need to describe the ritual in a narrative form. They suggest that the spoken word, like the acted ritual, was considered to have magical potency: "The spoken word had the efficacy of an act."&lt;ref&gt;Hooke; quoted in Segal (no specific text cited), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Frazer, Harrison believed that myths could arise as the initial reason a ritual was forgotten or became diluted. As an example, she cited rituals that center on the annual renewal of vegetation. Such rituals often involve a participant who undergoes a staged death and resurrection. Harrison argues that the ritual, although "performed annually, was exclusively initiatory";&lt;ref name="Segal71"/&gt; it was performed on people to initiate them into their roles as full-standing members of society. At this early point, the "god" was simply "the projection of the euphoria produced by the ritual."&lt;ref name="Segal71"/&gt; Later, however, this euphoria became personified as a distinct god, and this god later became the god of vegetation, for "just as the initiates symbolically died and were reborn as fully fledged members of society, so the god of vegetation and in turn crops literally died and were reborn."&lt;ref name="Segal71"/&gt; In time, people forgot the ritual's initiatory function and only remembered its status as a commemoration of the Adonis myth.&lt;ref name="Segal71"/&gt;

==Myth and ritual as non-coextensive==
Not all students of mythology think ritual emerged from myth or myth emerged from ritual: some allow myths and rituals a greater degree of freedom from one another. Although myths and rituals often appear together, these scholars do not think every myth has or had a corresponding ritual, or vice versa.

===Walter Burkert===
The classicist [[Walter Burkert]] believes myths and rituals were originally independent.&lt;ref name="Segal76"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; When myths and rituals do come together, he argues, they do so to reinforce each other. A myth that tells how the gods established a ritual reinforces that ritual by giving it divine status: "Do this because the gods did or do it."&lt;ref name="Segal76"/&gt; A ritual based on a mythical event makes the story of that event more than a mere myth: the myth becomes more important because it narrates an event whose imitation is considered sacred.&lt;ref name="Segal76"/&gt;

Furthermore, Burkert argues that myth and ritual together serve a "socializing function."&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Burkert gives the example of hunting rituals. Hunting, Burkert argues, took on a sacred, ritualistic aura once it ceased to be necessary for survival: "Hunting lost its basic function with the emergence of agriculture some ten thousand years ago. But hunting ritual had become so important that it could not be given up."&lt;ref&gt;Burkert (1979), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; By performing the ritual of hunting together, an ancient society bonded itself together as a group, and also provided a way for its members to vent their anxieties over their own aggressiveness and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronisław Malinowski===
Like William Smith, the anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] argued in his essay ''Myth in Primitive Psychology'' (1926) that myths function as fictitious accounts of the origin of rituals, thereby providing a justification for those rituals: myth "gives rituals a hoary past and thereby sanctions them."&lt;ref name="Segal2004p73"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malinowski also points out that many cultural practices besides ritual have related myths: for Malinowski, "myth and ritual are therefore not coextensive."&lt;ref name="Segal2004p73"/&gt; In other words, not all myths are outgrowths of ritual, and not all rituals are outgrowths of myth.

===Mircea Eliade===
Like Malinowski, the religious scholar [[Mircea Eliade]] thinks one important function of myth is to provide an explanation for ritual. Eliade notes that, in many societies, rituals are considered important precisely because they were established by the mythical gods or heroes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Myth and Reality," p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade approvingly quotes Malinowski's claim that a myth is "a narrative resurrection of a primeval reality."&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, "Myth in Primitive Psychology" (1926; reprinted in "Magic, Science and Religion" [New York: 1955], pp. 101, 108), quoted in Eliade, "Myth and Reality," p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade adds: "Because myth relates the ''gesta'' [deeds] of Supernatural Beings [...] it becomes the exemplary model for all significant human actions."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Myth and Reality," p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional man sees mythical figures as models to be imitated. Therefore, societies claim that many of their rituals were established by mythical figures, thereby making the rituals seem all the more important. However, also like Malinowski, Eliade notes that societies use myths to sanction many kinds of activities, not just rituals: "For him, too, then, myth and ritual are not coextensive."&lt;ref name="Segal2004p73"/&gt;

Eliade goes beyond Malinowski by giving an explanation for why myth can confer such an importance upon ritual: according to Eliade, "when [ritually] [re-]enacted myth acts as a time machine, carrying one back to the time of the myth and thereby bringing one closer to god."&lt;ref name="Segal2004p73"/&gt; But, again, for Eliade myth and ritual are not coextensive: the same return to the mythical age can be achieved simply by retelling a myth, without any ritual reenactment. According to Eliade, traditional man sees both myths and rituals as vehicles for "eternal return" to the mythical age (see [[Eternal return (Eliade)]]):
{{quote|"In imitating the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythic [[hero]], or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Myths, Dreams and Mysteries," p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recital of myths and enactment of rituals serve a common purpose: they are two different means to remain in sacred time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7989">[[Image:Pontifical Mass - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|thumb|A Pontifical Sung Mass, from a Missal of the Fifteenth Century, [[British Museum]]]]

In the context of the [[Tridentine Mass]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], a '''Pontifical High Mass''', also called '''Solemn Pontifical Mass''', is a [[Solemn Mass|Solemn or High Mass]] celebrated by a [[bishop]] using certain prescribed ceremonies. The term is also used among [[Anglo-Catholic]] [[Anglicans]]. Although in modern English the word "pontifical" is almost exclusively associated with the [[Pope]], any bishop may be properly called a [[pontiff]]. Thus, the celebrant of a Pontifical High Mass may be any bishop, and not just a pope.

==Origins==

In the early Church, [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was normally celebrated by the bishop, with other clergy. In the [[Roman Rite]] this evolved into a form of Solemn High Mass celebrated by a bishop accompanied by a [[deacon]], [[subdeacon]], assistant deacons,&lt;ref&gt;''Canonici in habitu diaconi si opus est, eius brachia sustentantes'' according to the ''Caeremoniale episcoporum.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[thurifer]], [[acolyte]](s) and other ministers, under the guidance of a priest acting as Master of Ceremonies. Most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests. The parts to be said aloud are all chanted, except that the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, which before the reform of [[Pope Pius V]] were said in the sacristy or during the entrance procession, were said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon, while the choir sang the Introit.

The full Pontifical High Mass is carried out when the bishop celebrates the Mass at the throne (or cathedra) in his own cathedral church, or with permission at the throne in another diocese.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pontifical Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Low Mass]] celebrated by a bishop is almost identical with one celebrated by a [[priest]], except that the bishop puts on the [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]] only after the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, uses the greeting "Peace be with you" rather than the priest or deacon's "The Lord be with you", and makes the sign of the cross three times at the final blessing, which may be preceded by a formula that begins with "Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini" (Our help is in the name of the Lord).

==Differences from ordinary Solemn Mass==

===Celebration by a bishop other than the pope===

In contrast to celebration by a priest, a bishop celebrates almost the entire first half of the Solemn High Mass until the offertory at the ''[[cathedra]]'', often referred to as his throne, to the left of the [[altar]]. Instead of saying ''Dominus vobiscum'' "The Lord be with you" as the opening liturgical greeting, a bishop says ''Pax vobis'' "Peace to you".

A bishop also wears vestments additional to those of a priest:
* The [[dalmatic]], the distinctive vestment of a deacon, worn under the bishop's [[chasuble]] to show that he has the full powers of the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]]
* The [[tunicle]], the particular vestment of the subdeacon, worn under the bishop's dalmatic, further to show the fullness of the [[major orders]]. Since the 19th century it looks almost exactly the same as the dalmatic
* The [[mitre]], the bishop's headdress
* The [[crosier]], the bishop's hooked staff
* [[buskin#Roman Catholic Church|Episcopal sandals]] along with [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13434a.htm episcopal sandals] a specially decorated form of footwear, in the shape of slippers
* a [[pectoral cross]]
* [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06589a.htm liturgical gloves]
* A [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan archbishop]], celebrating Mass within the area of his province over which he has jurisdiction, wears a [[pallium]] over the chasuble, as a sign of the special authority over the [[suffragan bishop]]s, granted by the [[Pope]]. The metropolitan archbishop does not need the permission of one of his suffragan bishops to celebrate Mass in one of the suffragan's churches or even the cathedral, but he will usually do so as a sign of respect.

When the bishop sits at the cathedra, a special silk cloth, called a [[gremial]](e), of the same liturgical colour as the bishop's vestments is placed in his lap.

===Papal Mass===

{{main|Papal Mass}}

[[Image:PapalMass1.JPG|thumb|right|Papal Solemn Mass celebrated by [[Pope John XXIII]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the early 1960s. &lt;br&gt;Note the presence of multiple assistant priests and ministers, and the mitre and the [[papal tiara]]s placed on the altar]]

The Pope's Pontifical High Mass, when celebrated with full solemnity, was even more elaborate. As is still done in papal Masses on occasions such as the inauguration of a pontificate, the [[Gospel]] and [[Epistle]] were sung not only in [[Latin language|Latin]] by a Latin-Rite deacon and subdeacon, but also in [[Greek language|Greek]] by [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern]] clergy, wearing the vestments of their own rite and observing its customs, such as placing the deacon's stole on the Gospel Book and bowing rather than genuflecting. This custom stresses the unity of the universal Catholic Church, formed by both the Eastern and the Western ([[Latin Church]]) Churches in full communion.

At the elevations of host and chalice, the Silveri symphony was played on the trumpets of the no longer existing [[Guardia Nobile|Noble Guard]]. Through a misunderstanding of the name Silveri, English speakers sometimes referred to this as the sounding of silver trumpets. An [[Asterisk (liturgy)|asterisk]] – a common eucharistic implement in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rites]], in which it is shaped differently from the twelve-ray asterisk that was used in Papal Masses - was used to cover the host on the [[paten]], when it was brought to the Pope at his throne for communion. The Pope drank the Precious Blood, the wine having been consecrated, through a golden tube. Even for the laity, the use of a tube [http://www.catholicliturgy.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/documentText/Index/4/SubIndex/67/ContentIndex/178/Start/1] is one of the four ways envisaged in the 1970 revision of the [[Roman Missal]] for receiving Communion from the chalice, cf. also ''General Instruction of the Roman Missal'', 248-250. It was also customary for some of the bread and wine used at the Mass to be consumed by the sacristan and the cup-bearer in the presence of the Pope at the offertory and again before the Our Father (''Pater noster'') in a short ceremony called the ''praegustatio'' as a precaution against poison or invalid matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perso.orange.fr/civitas.dei/PapalMass.htm ''Solemn Papal Mass'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglican use of the term==
In the Anglo-Catholic tradition of [[Anglicanism]], the term ''Pontifical High Mass'' may refer to a Mass celebrated with the traditional Tridentine ceremonies described above. Liturgical manuals such as ''Ritual Notes'' provide a framework for incorporating Tridentine ceremonial into the services of the [[Book of Common Prayer]]. More generally, the term may refer to any High Mass celebrated by a bishop, usually in the presence of his or her throne.  The Pontifical High Mass is one of four full-form pontifical functions, the other three being pontifical [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], High Mass in the presence of a greater prelate, and Solemn Evensong in the presence of a greater prelate. In its more traditional form, the ministers required at the service are a deacon and subdeacon of the Mass, assistant deacons in dalmatics, and an assistant priest in [[cope]] and [[surplice]], who acts as the episcopal [[chaplain]], along with the usual servers.&lt;ref&gt;E.C.R. Lamburn, ''Ritual Notes'', 11th ed., Knott, London 1964, 411ff&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pāñcajanya''' (or '''Panchjanya''') is the name of the [[conch]] (''Shankha'') in [[Hindu]] mythology which was blown by [[Krishna]] at the start of the [[Mahabharata War]] between the [[Kaurava]]s and [[Pandava]]s at Kurukshetra, which was a ''Dharam-yudha'' (sacred war for the righteous) between the usurper King [[Dhritrashtra]]'s hundred sons, the eldest being [[Duryodhana]], and the five [[Pandava]]s (the cousins) supported by Lord Krishna himself.

Panchjanya when blown by Lord [[Krishna]] symbolised the war was won by the righteous Pandavas.  Panchjanya is the ''udghosh'', the sound of righteousness to be heard by the people of the world. Panchjanya is mentioned in the text 15 of the first chapter of [[Bhagavad Gita]]. Panchjanya, the great conch was a token of gift taken from Panchjana, the navigator in whose ship Srikrishna voyaged to rescue Sandipani's son.

It is said that when Krishna blows on His transcendental conchshell, the wives of the demons become subject to abortions, and the wives of the demigods become blessed with all auspiciousness. In this way, the sound of Krishna's conchshell used to vibrate and circulate all over the world.

==Identification==
The Panchajanya Conch is a Sinistral variety of the species [[Turbinella pyrum]] L. showing total five plaits or folds in the conch cavity. This type is extremely rare.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4514">'''Qarin I''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: کارن), was the eighth ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 839 to 867. 

== Biography ==
His brother, [[Shapur (Bavandid ruler)|Shapur]], was murdered in 825 by an [[Qarinvand]] named [[Mazyar]], who then conquered his domains. With the aid of [[Abbasids]] and [[Tahirids]], however, Qarin managed to reclaim his domains from Mazyar. During the same period, Mazyar was betrayed by his brother [[Quhyar]], and was sentenced to death in [[Baghdad]]. In 842, Qarin converted to [[Islam]],{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}}{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=205–206}} where he was rewarded with the title of '''Abu'l-Muluk'''.

In the 860s, western Iran was governed by the Tahirid [[Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir]], whose brother [[Sulayman ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir]] deputized him in [[Tabaristan]] and [[Gurgan]]. Popular resentment of the Tahirids' rule increased through the oppression of their officials, especially their fiscal agents in the province. Consequently, in 864 a rebellion broke out in the towns of [[Royan, Iran|Ruyan]], Kalar and [[Chalus, Iran|Chalus]], led by two "sons of [[Rostam]]". The rebels called upon [[Hasan ibn Zayd]], an [[Alids|Alid]], to lead them, and allied themselves with the neighbouring [[Dailamites]]. Hasan, who assumed the [[laqab|regnal name]] ''al-Da‘ī ila’l-ḥaqq'' ("He who summons to the Truth"), was recognized as [[emir]] by a part of the local population, and even secured the allegiance of the [[Justanid]] king of [[Daylam]], [[Vahsudan ibn Marzuban]].{{sfn|Buhl|1986|pp=245}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|pp=102-103}}{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=205–206}} Qarin, however, opposed [[Zaydid]] rule in Tabaristan, and allied himself with Sulayman ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir against Hasan, but was defeated by Hasan in a battle, who had Qarin's domains devastated and his brother [[Ja'far ibn Shahriyar]] killed. Qarin then had to swear loyalty to the Zaydids and send his two sons [[Surkhab ibn Qarin]] and [[Maziar ibn Qarin]] as hostages to the Zaydid court, but quickly mutinied against Hasan, and in 868, was forced to flee to [[Qumis, Iran|Kumis]].{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}} Qarin I died in 867, and was succeeded by his son or grandson [[Rustam I]].

The '''religious views of Abraham Lincoln''' are a matter of interest among scholars and the public. [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] grew up in a highly religious [[Baptist]] family. He never joined any Church, and was a [[Religious skeptic|skeptic]] as a young man and sometimes ridiculed revivalists. He frequently referred to God and had a deep knowledge of the [[Bible]], often quoting it. Lincoln attended Protestant church services with his wife and children, and after two of them died he became more intensely concerned with religion.&lt;ref name="Fiery"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Fiery Trial | page=35 | author =  Eric Foner |isbn =978-0-393-06618-0 | oclc=601096674 | publisher=Norton | year=2010| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=earytjxi6pEC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lincoln never made an unambiguous public profession of Christian belief, several people who knew him personally, such as [[Chaplain of the United States Senate|Chaplain of the Senate]] [[Phineas Densmore Gurley|Phineas Gurley]] and [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], claimed that he believed in Christ in the religious sense.&lt;ref name="online"&gt;Mary T.

&lt;/ref&gt; However, close friends who had known Lincoln for years, such as [[Ward Hill Lamon]] and [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], rejected the idea that he was a believing Christian.&lt;ref name=Steiner1936 /&gt; During his 1846 run for the House of Representatives, in order to dispel accusations concerning his religious beliefs, Lincoln issued a handbill stating that he had "never denied the truth of the Scriptures".&lt;ref name="Abraham Lincoln Online"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/handbill.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln Online |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seemed to believe in an all-powerful God, who shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A. Noll|title=A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGF3wbzzy9QC&amp;pg=PA322|year=1992|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|pages=321–22|isbn=9780802806512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Lincoln's parents were [[Hard shell baptist|"hard shell" Baptists]], joining the Little Pigeon Baptist Church near [[Lincoln City, Indiana]], in 1823.&lt;ref name="NYT.baptist"&gt;{{cite news |title=Says Record Shows Lincoln A Baptist |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/10/31/98763649.pdf |newspaper=New York Times |date=October 31, 1921 |accessdate=2010-02-20 | format=PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1831, Lincoln moved to [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]], which had no churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald | first=David Herbert | title=Lincoln | location=New York | publisher=Touchstone | year=1995 | page=48}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, historian [[Mark Noll]] states that "Lincoln never joined a church nor ever made a clear profession of standard Christian belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pl/Abraham_Lincoln.html |title=The Ambiguous Religion of Abraham Lincoln |accessdate=2010-04-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505033555/http://www.adherents.com/people/pl/Abraham_Lincoln.html| archivedate=2010-05-05 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Noll quotes Lincoln's friend Jesse Fell:

{{quote|that the president "seldom communicated to anyone his views" on religion, and he went on to suggest that those views were not orthodox: "on the innate depravity of man, the character and office of the great head of the Church, the Atonement, the infallibility of the written revelation, the performance of miracles, the nature and design of...future rewards and punishments...and many other subjects, he held opinions utterly at variance with what are usually taught in the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A. Noll|title=A History of Christianity in the United States and Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGF3wbzzy9QC&amp;pg=PA322|year=1992|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noll argues Lincoln was turned against organized Christianity by his experiences as a young man witnessing how excessive emotion and bitter sectarian quarrels marked yearly camp meetings and the ministry of traveling preachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark A. |last=Noll |title=The Ambiguous Religion of President Abraham Lincoln |year=1992 |accessdate=2010-02-20 |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pl/Abraham_Lincoln.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
As a young man, Lincoln enjoyed reading the works of [[deists]] such as [[Thomas Paine]]. He drafted a pamphlet incorporating such ideas but did not publish it.  After charges of hostility to Christianity almost cost him a congressional bid, he kept his unorthodox beliefs private.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=thHUIbmvvhkC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A7SBT4X-KYqi8QPgwsCFBg&amp;ved=0CJsBEOgBMBM#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Radicals in Their Own Time] Michael Anthony Lawrence - 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- this info belongs here in the section about his early life.--&gt;
The one aspect of his parents' [[Calvinist]] religion that Lincoln apparently embraced wholeheartedly throughout his life was the "doctrine of necessity", also known as [[predestination]], [[determinism]], or [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0018.105/--abraham-lincoln-and-the-doctrine-of-necessity?rgn=main;view=fulltext |first=Allen C. |last=Guelzo |title=Abraham Lincoln and the Doctrine of Necessity |journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |volume=18.1 |year=1997 |accessdate=2010-02-20}} 29 pars.
&lt;/ref&gt;
It was almost always through these lenses that Lincoln assessed the meaning of the Civil War.

[[James Adams (lawyer)|James Adams]] labeled Lincoln as a deist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald | first=David Herbert | title=Lincoln | location=New York | publisher=Touchstone | year=1995 | page=74}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been reported that in 1834 he wrote a manuscript essay challenging orthodox [[Christianity]] modeled on Paine's book ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', which a friend supposedly burned to protect him from ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fighting for Lincoln's Soul |first=Michael |last=Nelson |publisher=Virginia Quarterly Review |date=Autumn 2003 |url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2003/autumn/nelson-fighting-lincolns-soul/ |accessdate=2010-02-20 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123033632/http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2003/autumn/nelson-fighting-lincolns-soul/ |archive-date=2009-01-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to biographer Rev. William Barton, Lincoln likely had written an essay something of this character, but it was not likely that it was burned in such a manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4LXXmsmdEYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The Soul of Abraham Lincoln |first=William Eleazar |last=Barton |year=1920|chapter= XII |page= 150 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; William J. Johnson, New Salem schoolteacher Mentor Graham, with whom Lincoln boarded, reported in 1874 that the manuscript was "a defense of [[Universal reconciliation|universal salvation]]."

The existence of the manuscript influenced by Paine was originally described by Herndon in his biography on Lincoln. Harvey Lee Ross, mail carrier who lived in New Salem with Lincoln in 1834, asserts that this was a fictional story by Herndon. He states the following issues with the original biographer's account. Herndon was 16 years old in 1834 and lived 20 miles away in Springfield and did not have contact with Lincoln. There was no stove in Samuel Hill's store in 1834 where the manuscript was allegedly burned.  There was not a copy of ''The Age of Reason'' on the bookshelf at the tavern where Herndon said Lincoln had read it. Finally, Ross states he was very well acquainted with everyone in the community of New Salem and he would have known about any conversations regarding a document of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;Rufus Rockwell Wilson (1946). Lincoln's First Years In Illinois, The Primavera Press, Inc, NY. pp.51-53.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a reasonable conclusion that there was never a manuscript written and Paine was not a contributing factor in Lincoln's ideas towards religion.

{{quote|I remember well his argument. He took the passage, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive," and followed with the proposition that whatever the breach or injury of Adam's transgression to the human race was, which no doubt was very great, was made just and right by the atonement of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William J. Johnson|title=Abraham Lincoln the Christian|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Abraham_Lincoln_the_Christian.html?id=SY6rNGoNaI0C|year=1913|publisher=New York: Eaton &amp; Mains|pages=31–34 (citing a letter dated March 17, 1874, from Petersburg, Illinois, and published in an article on "Lincoln's Religious Belief" in the Springfield Journal of May 16, 1874)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Noll writes, "At least early on, Lincoln was probably also a [[Universalist]] who believed in the eventual salvation of all people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark A. |last=Noll |title=The Puzzling Faith of Abraham Lincoln |year=1992 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1992/issue33/3311.html?start=1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln was often perplexed by the attacks on his character by way of his religious choices. In a letter written to Martin M. Morris in 1843, Lincoln wrote:

{{quote|There was the strangest combination of church influence against me. [[Edward Dickinson Baker|[Edward Dickinson] Baker]] is a [[Campbellite]]; and therefore, as I suppose with few exceptions, got all of that Church. My wife had some relations in the Presbyterian churches, and some in the Episcopal churches; and therefore, wherever it would tell, I was set down as either one or the other, while it was everywhere contended that no Christian ought to vote for me because I belonged to no Church, and was suspected of being a Deist and had talked of fighting a duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John G. |last=Nicolay |title=Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln |publisher=Kessinger Publishing Company |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Nicholas Shepherd, 1846-crop.jpg|thumb|alt=Middle aged clean shaven Lincoln from the hips up.|Lincoln in his late 30s as a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] (Photo taken by one of Lincoln's law students around 1846)]]

In 1846, when Lincoln ran for congress against [[Peter Cartwright (exhorter)|Peter Cartwright]], the noted evangelist, Cartwright tried to make Lincoln's religion or lack of it a major issue of the campaign.  Responding to accusations that he was an "infidel", Lincoln defended himself, publishing a hand-bill to "directly contradict" the charge made against him. The declaration was released as follows:

{{quote|'''Handbill Replying to Charges of Infidelity'''

July 31, 1846

''To the Voters of the Seventh Congressional District.''

FELLOW CITIZENS:

A charge having got into circulation in some of the neighborhoods of this District, in substance that I am an open scoffer at Christianity, I have by the advice of some friends concluded to notice the subject in this form. That I am not a member of any Christian Church, is true; but I have never denied the truth of the Scriptures; and I have never spoken with intentional disrespect of religion in general, or of any denomination of Christians in particular. It is true that in early life I was inclined to believe in what I understand is called the "Doctrine of Necessity"&amp;mdash;that is, that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control; and I have sometimes (with one, two or three, but never publicly) tried to maintain this opinion in argument. The habit of arguing thus however, I have, entirely left off for more than five years. And I add here, I have always understood this same opinion to be held by several of the Christian denominations. The foregoing, is the whole truth, briefly stated, in relation to myself, upon this subject.

I do not think I could myself, be brought to support a man for office, whom I knew to be an open enemy of, and scoffer at, religion. Leaving the higher matter of eternal consequences, between him and his Maker, I still do not think any man has the right thus to insult the feelings, and injure the morals, of the community in which he may live. If, then, I was guilty of such conduct, I should blame no man who should condemn me for it; but I do blame those, whoever they may be, who falsely put such a charge in circulation against me.

July 31, 1846. A. LINCOLN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lincoln|first1=Abraham|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln|date=1953|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Association|page=383|edition=Volume 1|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln1/1:403?rgn=div1;view=fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Carl Sandburg recounts in ''Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years'', Lincoln attended one of Cartwright's revival meetings. At the conclusion of the service, the fiery pulpiteer called for all who intended to go to heaven to rise. Naturally, the response was heartening. Then, he called for all those who wished to go to hell to stand. Unsurprisingly there were not many takers. Lincoln had responded to neither option. Cartwright closed in. "Mr. Lincoln, you have not expressed an interest in going to either heaven or hell. May I enquire as to where you do plan to go?" Lincoln replied: "I did not come here with the idea of being singled out, but since you ask, I will reply with equal candor. I intend to go to Congress."&lt;ref name=Steiner1936&gt;

[[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], Lincoln's law partner, stated that Lincoln admired deists Thomas Paine and [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref name="Lander2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Lander|title=Lincoln and Darwin: Shared Visions of Race, Science, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaTnoZ_uYlUC|year=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Herndon, an advocate of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s, said Lincoln thought the works of authors like Darwin and Spencer "entirely too heavy for an ordinary mind to digest" but he read and was "interested ... greatly" in a book expounding on these ideas, "''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges of Creation]]''", and he was "deeply impressed with the notion of the so-called 'universal law' — evolution... and he became a warm advocate of the new doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William H. Herndon|title=Herndon's Life of Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51KsKiobw2cC&amp;pg=PA354|origyear=1889|year=2008|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Hitchens |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/01/09/the-man-who-made-us-whole.html |title=Hitchens on Lincoln |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln believed in God, but some said he doubted the idea that Christ is God. In a written statement to Herndon, James W. Keyes said Lincoln 

&lt;blockquote&gt;believed in a Creator of all things, who had neither beginning nor end, who possessing all power and wisdom, established a principal, in Obedience to which, Worlds move and are upheld, and animel and vegatable life came into existence. A reason he gave for his belief was, that in view of the Order and harmony of nature which all beheld, it would have been More miraculouis to have Come about by chance, than to have been created and arranged by some great thinking power.&lt;ref name = "Keyes"&gt;{{cite web|author=James W.

Keyes also added that Lincoln once said 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the christian theory, that, Christ is God, or equal to the Creator he said had better be taken for granted — for by the test of reason all might become infidels on that subject, for evidence of Christs divinity Came to us in somewhat doubtful Shape — but that the Sistom of Christianity was an ingenious one at least — and perhaps was Calculated to do good.&lt;ref name = "Keyes"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the White House years, Lincoln and his family often attended the [[New York Avenue Presbyterian Church]], where the family pew he rented is marked by a plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrlincolnswhitehouse.org/inside.asp?ID=189&amp;subjectID=4 |title=Mr. Lincoln's White House |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Inaugural Address==
[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-55, 1861-crop.jpg|thumb|The first photographic image of Lincoln as president]]

On Monday, March 4, 1861, Lincoln delivered his first inaugural address, after the oath of office was administered by Chief Justice Roger Taney.  Lincoln's speech addressed the national crisis of the southern secession from the union.  Lincoln had hoped to resolve the conflict peacefully without a civil war.  During the address, Lincoln stated "Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/lincoln1.asp |title=First Inaugural Address of Abraham Lincoln  |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In 1862 and 1863, during the most difficult days of the Civil War and his presidency, Lincoln's utterances were sometimes marked with spiritual overtones.

===1862: Bereavement and Emancipation===
[[File:WILLIE.JPG|thumb|[[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie Lincoln]], who died in the White House during his father's presidency]]
On Thursday, February 20, 1862, at 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Lincoln's eleven-year-old son, [[William Wallace Lincoln]] ("Willie"), died at the White House. Historians suggest that this may have been the most difficult personal crisis in Lincoln's life. After the funeral, he attempted a return to his routine but was unable. One week after the funeral, he isolated himself in his office and wept all day. Several people reported that Lincoln told them that his feelings about religion changed at this time. Willie is reported to have often remarked that he wanted to become a minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prairieghosts.com/a_lincoln.html |title=Seances In The White House?

&lt;/ref&gt;

When his son died, Lincoln reportedly said, "May God live in all. He was too good for this earth. The good Lord has called him home. I know that he is much better off in Heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Behind the Scenes, or, Thirty years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House |location=New York |publisher=G. W.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

This transformation is reported by a considerable number of contemporaries, and a number of scholars agree, though there is less agreement on the nature of this change.
*Pulitzer prize historian David H. Donald, ''Lincoln'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995), p. 336-337, writes: "After the burial the President repeatedly shut himself in a room so that he could weep alone... During this time he increasingly turned to religion for solace... During the weeks after Willie's death Lincoln had several long talks with the Rev. Phineas D. Gurley, pastor of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington where the Lincolns rented a pew... [W]hen he looked back on the events of this tragic spring, recognized that he underwent what he called 'a process of crystallization' in his religious beliefs."
*Ronald White, ''Lincoln's Greatest Speech'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002), p. 134, writes, "Many have pointed to the death of Willie on February 20, 1862, as a critical moment in Lincoln's struggles with faith."
*[[Stephen Oates]], ''With Malice Toward None: A Life of Abraham Lincoln'' (Harper &amp; Row, 1977), p. 70, writes, "After Willie's death, he talked more frequently about God than he had before."
*Sandburg, ''Abraham Lincoln: The War Years'', III:379-380, recounts a report that "Mr. Lincoln's views in relation to spiritual things seemed changed from that hour [viz., Willie's death]."
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spiritualism]], popularly in vogue during this era, was tried by Lincoln's wife. She used the services of mediums and spiritualists to try to contact their dead son. Lincoln allegedly attended at least one seance at the White House at this time with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mary_todd_lincoln.htm |title=Mary Todd Lincoln and Clairvoyance |accessdate=2010-02-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Matthew Simpson|Bishop Matthew Simpson]] gave the address at Lincoln's funeral he quoted him asking a soldier "Do you ever find yourself talking with the dead? Since Willie's death, I catch myself every day, involuntarily talking with him as if he were with me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Morris|editor1-first=Benjamin Franklin|title=Memorial Record of the Nation's Tribute to Abraham Lincoln ...

At the same time, the war was not going well for the Union. General [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]]'s failure in the [[Peninsula Campaign]] came about within months after Willie's death. Next came [[Robert E. Lee]]'s impressive victory at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], after which he said, "I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOYGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=%22Scribner%27s+Monthly%22+%2B1873+%2B%22The+Later+Life+and+Religious+Sentiments+of+Abraham+Lincoln%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |last=Reed |first=James A. |title=The Later Life and Religious Sentiments of Abraham Lincoln |journal=Scribner's Monthly |volume=6| issue =  3 |date=July 1873 |page=340}}citing Noah Brooks article in ''Harper's Monthly'', July 1865
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David H. Donald, ''Lincoln'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995), 354, writes, "By the summer of 1862, Lincoln felt especially in need of divine help. Everything, it seemed, was going wrong, and his hope for bringing a speedy end to the war was dashed."
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Salmon Chase, as he was preparing to issue the preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]], Lincoln said, "I made a solemn vow before God, that if General Lee was driven back from Maryland I would crown the result by the declaration of freedom to the slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTsl3N7hDpAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=six+months+at+the+white+house+carpenter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bUkvamYWdL&amp;sig=rWzfEd_nifcgEQhd6T3EvRsKPqk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gXt_S4fMKIOeswPcq9n8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  |first=Frank B |last=Carpenter |authorlink=Francis Bicknell Carpenter |title=Six Months at the White House |year=1866 |page=90 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}
as reported by Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon Portland Chase, September 22, 1862. Others present used the word ''resolution'' instead of ''vow to God''. [[Gideon Welles]], ''Diary of Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy Under Lincoln and Johnson'' (Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1911), 1:143, reported that Lincoln made a covenant with God that if God would change the tide of the war, Lincoln would change his policy toward slavery. See also Nicholas Parrillo, "Lincoln's Calvinist Transformation: Emancipation and War," ''Civil War History'' (September 1, 2000).
&lt;/ref&gt; The differences in interpretation of Lincoln's statement may be due to the belief that "swearing or vowing" to God was considered blasphemous by some religious organizations.{{ref}}

At the same time, Lincoln sat down in his office and penned the following words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be, wrong. God cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war it is quite possible that God's purpose is something different from the purpose of either party -- and yet the human instrumentalities, working just as they do, are of the best adaptation to effect His purpose. I am almost ready to say that this is probably true -- that God wills this contest, and wills that it shall not end yet. By his mere great power, on the minds of the now contestants, He could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And, having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/meditat.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's Meditation on the Divine Will |accessdate=2010-02-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This concept continued to dominate Lincoln's public remarks for the rest of the war. The same theological allegory was to be prominent in [[Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address]] in March 1865:

{{quote|Both [North and South] read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes.}}

===1863: Gettysburg===
In late 1862 and early 1863 Lincoln would endure more agonies. The defeat of General [[Ambrose Burnside]] at Fredericksburg followed by the defeat of General [[Joseph Hooker]] at Chancellorsville sent Lincoln into a deep depression. "If there is a worse place than hell I am in it," Lincoln told [[Andrew Curtin]] in December 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Sandburg, ''Abraham Lincoln: The War Years'' (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1939), Vol. 1, 630.
&lt;/ref&gt;

1863 was to be the year, however, in which the tide turned in favor of the Union. The [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863 was the first time that Lee was soundly defeated. Prompted by [[Sarah Josepha Hale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm |title=1863 Thanksgiving Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln |accessdate=2010-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100123030743/http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm| archivedate=2010-01-23 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
in the fall, Lincoln issued the first Federally mandated Thanksgiving Day to be kept on the last Thursday in November. Reflecting on the successes of the past year, Lincoln said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/source/sb2/sb2w.htm |title=NPS Source Book: Abraham Lincoln |accessdate=2010-02-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 1863, Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto, "[[In God We Trust]]," to engrave on U.S. coins. Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted "doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval."
&lt;/ref&gt;

When a pious minister told Lincoln he "hoped the Lord is on our side," the president responded, "I am not at all concerned about that.... But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord's side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=F.B. |last=Carpenter |title=Six Months at the White House |authorlink=Francis Bicknell Carpenter |page=282 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTsl3N7hDpAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=six+months+at+the+white+house+carpenter&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bUkvamYWdL&amp;sig=rWzfEd_nifcgEQhd6T3EvRsKPqk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gXt_S4fMKIOeswPcq9n8Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |year=1866 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1863, Lincoln travelled to [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], to participate in the dedication of the cemetery established there for the thousands of soldiers who died during the recent battle. There he gave his celebrated speech, the [[Gettysburg Address]], wherein he hoped that the nation shall, "under God," have a new birth of freedom. The words, "under God," may not have been in his written manuscript, but it is posited by some sources that he added them extemporaneously from the podium.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Barton, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg: What He Intended to Say; What He Said; What he was Reported to have Said; What he Wished he had Said'' (New York: Peter Smith, 1950), pp. 138-139.
&lt;/ref&gt;
According to scholars, he may have drawn the expression from George Washington's hagiographer, [[Parson Weems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/264xqezm.asp?pg=1 |title=Under God |accessdate=2010-02-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===1864===
In 1864, some former slaves in Maryland presented Lincoln with a gift of a Bible. According to one report, Lincoln replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In regard to this great book, I have but to say, it is the best gift God has given to man. All the good the Saviour gave to the world was communicated through this book. But for it we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are to be found portrayed in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=lincoln;rgn=div1;view=text;idno=lincoln7;node=lincoln7%3A1184 |title=Abraham Lincoln, quoted in ''The Washington Daily Morning Chronicle'' |date=September 8, 1864 |accessdate=2010-02-20}} ''The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'' (Rutgers University Press, 1953), Roy P. Basler, editor. Volume, VII, p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the reported speech in Maryland, Lincoln's law partner Herndon remarked "I am aware of the fraud committed on Mr. Lincoln in reporting some insane remarks supposed to have been made by him, in 1864, on the presentation of a Bible to him by the colored people of Baltimore. No sane man ever uttered such folly, and no sane man will ever believe it."&lt;ref&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Six Historic Americans: Abraham Lincoln". http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_5.html#3. Retrieved 2011-01-02."&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1864, Lincoln, placing the Civil War squarely within a divine province, wrote in a letter to a member of the [[Quakers|Society of Friends]], "The purposes of the Almighty are perfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals may fail accurately to perceive them in advance. We hoped for a happy termination of this terrible war long before this; but God knows best, and has ruled otherwise...we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us, trusting that so working still conduces to the great ends He ordains. Surely He intends some great good to follow this mighty convulsion, which no mortal could make, and no mortal could stay."&lt;ref name="Donald 1996, p. 514-515"&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 514–515.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1865===
On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he told his wife at [[Ford's Theatre]] that he wanted to visit the [[Holy Land]] and that "there was no place he so much desired to see as Jerusalem." &lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

===1865: Memory book===
Following Lincoln's assassination a memory book, ''The Lincoln Memorial Album—Immortelles'', in which people could write their thoughts includes some comments on Lincoln's religion. One entry, written by a well-known Presbyterian minister, the [[John Henry Barrows|Rev. John H. Barrows]], claimed that Lincoln had become a Christian in 1863 but provided no evidence. He said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the anxious uncertainties of the great war, he gradually rose to the heights where Jehovah became to him the sublimest of realities, the ruler of nations....When darkness gathered over the brave armies fighting for the nation's life, this strong man in the early morning knelt and wrestled in prayer with Him who holds the fate of empires. When the clouds lifted above the carnage of Gettysburg, he gave his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lincoln Memorial Album |page=508 |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_5.html#1.18 |accessdate=2010-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210090350/http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_5.html| archivedate=2010-02-10 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pastor of a church in Freeport, Illinois, in November 1864, said that a man from Illinois visited Lincoln in the White House and, after conducting other business, asked the president if he loved Jesus. The pastor said that Lincoln buried his face in his handkerchief as tears came to his eyes and then answered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I left home to take this chair of state, I requested my countrymen to pray for me. I was not then a Christian. When my son died, the severest trial of my life, I was not a Christian. But, when I went to Gettysburg and looked upon the graves of our dead heroes who had fallen in defense of their country, I then and there consecrated myself to Christ. Yes, ''I do love Jesus''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quote appeared on page one of the ''Freeport Weekly Journal'' on December 7, 1864.&lt;ref&gt;''Freeport Weekly Journal'', "The Victory of Truth, a Discourse Preached on the Day of National Thanksgiving, November 24, 1864, in the First Presbyterian Church of Freeport, Illinois, by Isaac E. Carey", Quote appears in ''Freeport Weekly Journal,'' December 7, 1864, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

This has been portrayed to have been Lincoln's "reply" to this unnamed Illinois minister when asked if he loved Jesus. Some versions of this have Lincoln using the word "crosses" instead of "graves", and some have him saying "Christ" instead of "Jesus". William Eleazar Barton quotes this version in ''The Soul of Abraham Lincoln'' (1920), but further writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This incident must have appeared in print immediately after Lincoln's death, for I find it quoted in memorial addresses of May, 1865. Mr. Oldroyd has endeavored to learn for me in what paper he found it and on whose authority it rests, but without result. He does not remember where he found it. It is inherently improbable, and rests on no adequate testimony. It ought to be wholly disregarded. The earliest reference I have found to the story in which Lincoln is alleged to have said to an unnamed Illinois minister, "I do love Jesus" is in a sermon preached in the Baptist Church of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, April 19, 1865, by Rev. W.W. Whitcomb, which was published in the Oshkosh ''Northwestern'', April 21, 1865, and in 1907 issued in pamphlet form by John E. Burton.&lt;ref&gt;See a discussion of this story in ''They Never Said It'', by Paul F. Boller &amp; John George (Oxford Univ. Press, 1989, p. 91).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==After his assassination==
[[File:AbrahamLincolnOilPainting1869Restored.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of Lincoln sitting with his hand on his chin and his elbow on his leg.|''[[Abraham Lincoln (Healy)|Lincoln]]'', painting by [[George Peter Alexander Healy]] in 1869]]

Following Lincoln's assassination, there were competing biographies, some claiming Lincoln had been a Christian and others that he had been a non-believer. In 1872, Colonel [[Ward Hill Lamon]] published his ''Life of Abraham Lincoln; From his Birth to his Inauguration as President'' using interviews and correspondences collected by [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], Lincoln's law partner in Springfield. Lamon had also been a law partner with Lincoln in Illinois, from 1852 until 1857, and later was Lincoln's personal bodyguard in Washington. Lamon's biography stated that Lincoln did not himself believe in the divinity of Jesus, and that several who knew him as a young man described him as an "infidel".&lt;ref name=Steiner1936 /&gt;

Rev. James Armstrong Reed, in preparing his 1873 lectures on the religion of Lincoln, asked a number of people if there was any evidence of Lincoln being an "infidel" in his later life. The reply from [[Phineas Gurley]], pastor of the same [[New York Avenue Presbyterian Church]] while Lincoln was an attender, to Reed's question was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not believe a word of it. It could not have been true of him while here, for I have had frequent and intimate conversations with him on the subject of the Bible and the Christian religion, when he could have had no motive to deceive me, and I considered him sound not only on the truth of the Christian religion but on all its fundamental doctrines and teaching. And more than that: in the latter days of his chastened and weary life, after the death of his son Willie, and his visit to the battle-field of Gettysburg, he said, with tears in his eyes, that he had lost confidence in everything but God, and that he now believed his heart was changed, and that he loved the Saviour, and, if he was not deceived in himself, it was his intention soon to make a profession of religion.&lt;ref name="Reed 339"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Noah Brooks, a newspaperman, and a friend and biographer of Lincoln's, in reply to Reed's inquiry if there was any truth to claims that Lincoln was an "infidel", stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to what has appeared from my pen, I will state that I have had many conversations with Mr. Lincoln, which were more or less of a religious character, and while I never tried to draw anything like a statement of his views from him, yet he freely expressed himself to me as having 'a hope of blessed immortality through Jesus Christ.' His views seemed to settle so naturally around that statement, that I considered no other necessary. His language seemed not that of an inquirer, but of one who had a prior settled belief in the fundamental doctrines of the Christian religion. Once or twice, speaking to me of the change which had come upon him, he said, while he could not fix any definite time, yet it was after he came here, and I am very positive that in his own mind he identified it with about the time of Willie's death. He said, too, that after he went to the White House he kept up the habit of daily prayer. Sometimes he said it was only ten words, but those ten words he had. There is no possible reason to suppose that Mr. Lincoln would ever deceive me as to his religious sentiments. In many conversations with him, I absorbed the firm conviction that Mr. Lincoln was at heart a Christian man, believed in the Savior, and was seriously considering the step which would formally connect him with the visible church on earth. Certainly, any suggestion as to Mr. Lincoln's skepticism or Infidelity, to me who knew him intimately from 1862 till the time of his death, is a monstrous fiction -- a shocking perversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOYGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=%22Scribner%27s+Monthly%22+%2B1873+%2B%22The+Later+Life+and+Religious+Sentiments+of+Abraham+Lincoln%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a |title=The Later Life and Religious Sentiments of Abraham Lincoln |publisher=Scribner's Monthly |volume=6| issue =  3 |first=James A. |last=Reed |date=July 1873 |page=340 |accessdate=2010-02-20}} Noah Brooks to J.A.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to an affidavit signed under oath in Essex County, New Jersey, February 15, 1928, by Mrs. Sidney I. Lauck, then a very old woman: "After Mr. Lincoln's death, Dr. Gurley told me that Mr. Lincoln had made all the necessary arrangements with him and the Session of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church to be received into the membership of the said church, by confession of his faith in Christ, on the Easter Sunday following the Friday night when Mr. Lincoln was assassinated." Mrs. Lauck was, she said, about thirty years of age at the time of the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;D. James Kennedy in his booklet, "What They Believed:  The Faith of Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln" p. 59, Published by Coral Ridge Ministries, 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;
While this is possible, Dr. Gurley did not mention anything about Lincoln's impending membership at the funeral in the White House, in which he delivered the sermon that has been preserved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gurley.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's White House Funeral Sermon |accessdate=2010-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100219202810/http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gurley.htm| archivedate=2010-02-19 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}
&lt;/ref&gt; nor in his reply to Reed (above).

[[Francis Bicknell Carpenter]], the author of ''Six Months in the White House'', told Reed that he "believed Mr. Lincoln to be a sincere Christian"  and reported that Lincoln had told a woman from Brooklyn in the United States Christian Commission that he had had "a change of heart" and intended "at some suitable opportunity to make a profession of religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOYGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=%22Scribner%27s+Monthly%22+%2B1873+%2B%22The+Later+Life+and+Religious+Sentiments+of+Abraham+Lincoln%22&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a |title=The Later Life and Religious Sentiments of Abraham Lincoln |publisher=Scribner's Monthly |volume=6| issue =  3 |first=James A. |last=Reed |date=July 1873 |page=340 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. [[Madison Clinton Peters]], in his 1909 biography wrote, "That he was a true and sincere Christian, in fact, if not in form, is fully proved by many extracts from his letters and public utterances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=Madison |title=Abraham Lincoln's Religion |publisher=Graham Press |year=1909 |page=29 |url=http://libsysdigi.library.uiuc.edu/oca/Books2008-06/abrahamlincolnsr00peter/abrahamlincolnsr00peter.pdf |accessdate=2010-02-20 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotations attributed to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mrs. Lincoln]] seem inconsistent. She wrote to Reverend Smith, the pastor in Springfield: "When too - the overwhelming sorrow came upon us, our beautiful bright angelic boy, Willie was called away from us, to his Heavenly Home, with God's chastising hand upon us - he turned his heart to Christ."&lt;ref name="online"/&gt;

But Ward Lamon claimed that Mary Lincoln said to William Herndon:  "Mr. Lincoln had no hope and no faith in the usual acceptance of these words".&lt;ref&gt;Ward Hill (Colonel) Lamon, ''Life of Lincoln'' p. 489
&lt;/ref&gt;
and Herndon claimed she told him that "Mr. Lincoln's maxim and philosophy were, 'What is to be, will be, and no prayers of ours can arrest the decree.' He never joined any church. He was a religious man always, I think, but was not a technical Christian."&lt;ref&gt;William Herndon ''Religion of Lincoln''
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Mary Lincoln utterly denied these quotes, insisting that Herndon had "put those words in her mouth." She wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;With very great sorrow &amp; natural indignation have I read of Mr Herndon, placing words in my mouth--never once uttered. I remember the call he made on me for a few minutes at the [St. Nicholas] hotel as he mentions, your welcome entrance a quarter of an hour afterward, naturally prevented a further interview with him. Mr Herndon, had always been an utter stranger to me, he was not considered an habitué, at our house.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Todd Lincoln to John T. Stuart, December 15, 1873, ''Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters'', ed. Justin G. Turner and Linda Leavitt Turner (New York: Knopf, 1972), 603.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Herndon's reply to these accusations was never answered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jala/22.2/wilson.html |title=Herndon's reply and more on the enmity between himself and Mary Lincoln |accessdate=2010-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100211144445/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jala/22.2/wilson.html| archivedate=2010-02-11 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Remsburg]] (1848–1919), President of the [[American Secular Union]] in 1897, argued against claims of Lincoln's conversion in his book ''Six Historic Americans'' (1906). He cites several of Lincoln's close associates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_5.html#3 |title=Six Historic Americans: Abraham Lincoln |accessdate=2010-02-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210090350/http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/john_remsburg/six_historic_americans/chapter_5.html| archivedate=2010-02-10 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*The man who stood nearest to President Lincoln at Washington—nearer than any clergyman or newspaper correspondent—was his private secretary, [[John George Nicolay|Col. John G. Nicolay]]. In a letter dated May 27, 1865, Colonel Nicolay says: "Mr. Lincoln did not, to my knowledge, in any way change his religious ideas, opinions, or beliefs from the time he left Springfield to the day of his death."
*His lifelong friend and executor, [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|Judge David Davis]], affirmed the same: "He had no faith in the Christian sense of the term."
*His biographer, [[Ward Hill Lamon|Colonel Lamon]], intimately acquainted with him in Illinois, and with him during all the years that he lived in Washington, says: "Never in all that time did he let fall from his lips or his pen an expression which remotely implied the slightest faith in Jesus as the son of God and the Savior of men." Both Lamon and Herndon published biographies of their former colleague after his assassination relating their personal recollections of him. Each denied Lincoln's adherence to Christianity and characterized his religious beliefs as deist or skeptical.

In a letter dated February 4, 1866, William Herndon wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Lincoln's religion is too well known to me to allow of even a shadow of a doubt; he is or was a Theist &amp; a Rationalist, denying all extraordinary - supernatural inspiration or revelation. At one time in his life, he was an elevated [[Pantheism|Pantheist]], doubting the immortality of the soul as the Christian world understands that term. He believed that the soul lost its identity and was immortal as a force. Subsequent to this he rose to the belief of a God, and this is all the change he ever underwent. I speak knowing what I say. He was a noble man- a good great man for all this. My own ideas of God- his attributes - man, his destiny, &amp; the relations of the two, are tinged with Mr. Lincoln's religion. I cannot, for the poor life of me, see why men dodge the sacred truth of things. In my poor lectures I stick to the truth and bide my time. I love Mr. Lincoln dearly, almost worship him, but that can't blind me. He's the purest politician I ever saw, and the justest man. I am scribbling- that's the word- away on a life of Mr. Lincoln- gathering known- authentic &amp; true facts of him. Excuse the liberties I have taken with you- hope you won't have a fight with Johnson. Is he turning out a fool - a Tyler? He must go with God if he wants to be a living and vital power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raab Collection|url=http://www.raabcollection.com/presidential/abraham-lincoln-autograph/Abraham-Lincoln-Autograph-Religion.aspx|work=Raab Collection|accessdate=2011-04-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513182211/http://www.raabcollection.com/presidential/abraham-lincoln-autograph/Abraham-Lincoln-Autograph-Religion.aspx| archivedate=2011-05-13 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Guy|title='Pantheist' Lincoln would be unelectable today|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pantheist-lincoln-would-be-unelectable-today-2269024.html|accessdate=2012-06-05|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern views==
In ''Lincoln: A Life of Purpose and Power'' (2006), [[Richard Carwardine]] of Oxford University highlights Lincoln's considerable ability to rally evangelical Northern Protestants to the flag by nourishing the millennial belief that they were God's chosen people. Historian [[Allen C. Guelzo]] notes: "This was no mean feat, coming from a man who had been suspected of agnosticism or atheism for most of his life. Yet by the end, while still a religious skeptic, Lincoln, too, seemed to equate the preservation of the Union and the freeing of the slaves with some higher, mystical purpose."&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EEDC153EF93AA25751C0A9609C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

Guelzo, director of Civil War Era Studies at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, published ''Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President'' in 1999. Guelzo argues that Lincoln's boyhood inculcation of Calvinism was the dominant thread running through his adult life. He characterizes Lincoln's worldview as a kind of "Calvinized Deism".&lt;ref&gt;p447 ''Redeemer President''

==Synopsis==
===From pleasure to sin===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
For the Jews, procreation was the vital aspect of sex, but it was celebrated as part of a polygamous male-centred culture. Celibacy, adultery and homosexuality were outlawed. The [[Greek culture]] dominant at the time of Christ celebrated sexuality, particularly the male body and wives had no more rights than slaves. But there was another strand, the world of the spirit being more important to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] with a denial of the flesh.

[[Jesus]] decreed [[monogamy]] and no [[divorce]] but said little else about it and he was not representative of his church in other ways. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] praised celibacy but was divided: he called one woman an apostle but forbade women from speaking in church.

In the second century, [[Anthony of Egypt]] became the most famous of hermits who brought in the idea of [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s from the [[Syriac Christianity|Syrian]] understanding of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. The [[apocryphal]] [[Gospel of James]] elaborated [[Virgin Mary|Mary]]'s story and introduced the idea of her [[perpetual virginity]] and [[Immaculate conception|miraculous birth]]. People began to explain away Jesus's brothers and sisters, so that the most important marriage in the Christian story does not involve sex at all. [[Clement of Alexandria]] taught that sex except for procreation is wrong and [[Origen]] castrated himself to avoid temptation.

After [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]'s [[Vision of Constantine|vision of the Cross]] before the [[Battle of the Milvian Bridge]] had in his view given him the [[Roman Empire|empire]], he aligned Christianity with imperial power. [[Jerome]] tried to be a monk but became secretary to the [[bishop of Rome]] where he attacked [[Helvidius]] who claimed that Mary had enjoyed family life, and claimed that Joseph as well as [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Mary was a virgin]].

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s sexual conflicts lay at the root of his teaching about sex summed up by the biblical exhortation "make no provision for the flesh". Holiness demanded control, the opposite of lust which he decided was a consequence of the fall: it explains our conviction that sex is shameful.

When Roman power collapsed in the fourth century, Christianity stepped into the power vacuum. Teaching was spread by the [[Christian monasticism|monasteries]] and the [[penitential]] laid out endless rules about sex: on only 100 days a year was any sex permitted and years of penitence were decreed for any non-acceptable behaviour such as [[oral sex]] or [[masturbation]].

===Sexual revolution===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
It was not until [[Pope Gregory VII]] in the 11th century that [[Gregorian Reform|marriage became a Christian ceremony]]. To ensure inheritance, couples must then be married by a priest and rules including the [[Affinity (canon law)|prohibition of seventh cousins marrying]] gave large powers to the church who would sell [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensations]] for marriage or [[annulment]] for large sums. Under the [[Sarum Rite]], marriages only took place in the porch of the church, but this ambivalence slowly dissolved. In 1139 [[priestly marriages]] were declared invalid and the celibate priests increasingly saw themselves as superior. Women who had learning and a voice through the monasteries, were now excluded from the new universities and some resorted to [[mysticism]], which often had erotic overtones. 

Excessive sexual desire even for your own wife was now seen as wrong. But alongside this grew the tradition of [[courtly love]], which celebrated adultery and even homosexuality. [[Thomas Aquinas]] said that the greatest castle needed a sewer and the churches allowed [[brothel]]s—the 'stews'—next to the cathedral.

In the 16th century [[Martin Luther]] rebelled against the church's monopoly. He rejected Augustine's idea of [[Original sin#Augustine|original sin]] as transmitted through sex, and the sacramental nature of marriage. He decided that all clergy should be married, leading by example and having six children in eight years. The [[Münster Rebellion|Anabaptists of Münster]] went a lot further, and [[John of Leiden]] even introduced [[polygamy]] during the year-long siege of the town by the local bishop. He was captured and tortured with several others and their bodies displayed in a cage on the side of the church.

One aim of the [[Counter-Reformation]] was to put this revolution back in the box. Part of the effort was the establishment of the [[Piarists|Pious schools]] by [[Joseph Calasanz]] in [[Spain]] in the early 17th century. Unfortunately the headmaster of the school in [[Naples]], Father Stefano Cherubini, was found to be sexually abusing his pupils. Because of his powerful Papal connections, Calasanz didn't sack him but instead promoted him, so that he eventually displaced Calasanz.

Across Europe, women were accused of [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|witchcraft]] by both Catholics and Protestants. Many were tortured into confessing sex with the devil in the [[Würzburg witch trial]]. In 1590, even bad weather was blamed on witchcraft and 80 of 100 burned at the stake were women.

===Christianity v The West===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
The 18th century saw the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] with the Christian authorities losing control of sex. In London's [[Covent Garden]] there were all types of prostitutes by 1711 and meeting places for gays called "[[Molly house]]s" where [[same-sex marriage]] was performed. 

[[John Wesley]]'s [[evangelical revival]] saw a new role for women with the woman preachers such as [[Ordination of women in the United Methodist Church#John Wesley's views on women|Sarah Crosby]] and women started to become the bulk of the congregations. But after Wesley's death, the Methodist conference in 1803 stopped women preachers and a promising start faded out, just as in the early church.

The [[French Revolution]] stripped the church of its wealth and killed 2,000 priests, marriage became secular, divorce was permitted and homosexuality legitimised, though peace with the church was restored by [[Napoleon]]. [[Secular marriage]] was restored in the 1830s in England by civil registration which spread to all European countries and divorce was permitted from 1857, although the Church of England wouldn't accept the remarriage of divorcees until 2002.  

Very often reforming legislation was supported by some within the church. Thus [[Josephine Butler]] led the campaign against the [[Contagious Diseases Act]]; [[John Colenso|Bishop Colenso]] argued in favour of tolerance of polygamy where it was traditional in Africa; in 1930 the [[Lambeth Conference]] accepted the need for condoms in specific situations; [[Derrick Sherwin Bailey]] argued for the [[decriminalization]] of homosexuality.

But the Catholic church generally battened down the hatches, although scandals forfeited trust, with [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict]] resigning at the height of the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|child sexual abuse scandals]].

'''''Sicut dudum''''' ({{lang-en|Just as Long Ago}}) is a [[papal bull]] promulgated by [[Pope Eugene IV]] in Florence on January 13, 1435, which forbade the enslavement of local [[Guanches|natives]] in the [[Canary Islands]] who had converted or were converting to Christianity. ''Sicut dudum'' was meant to reinforce ''[[Creator omnium]]'', issued  the previous year, condemning Portuguese slave raids in the Canary Islands. Over forty years after ''Creator omnium'' and ''Sicut dudum'', [[Pope Sixtus IV]] found it necessary to repeat the prohibition in his papal bull ''Regimini gregis'', which threatened the excommunication of all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians.

== Background ==
[[File:LocationCanaries.PNG|thumb|Location of Canary Islands]]
Christianity had gained many converts in the Canary Islands by the early 1430s. The ownership of the lands had been the subject of dispute between Portugal and the Kingdom of Castille. The lack of effective control had resulted in periodic raids on the islands to procure slaves. Acting on a complaint by Fernando Calvetos, bishop of the islands,&lt;ref name=Housley&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5qCDL94HWN8C&amp;pg=PA184 Housley, Norman. ''Religious Warfare in Europe 1400–1536'', Oxford University Press, 2002] {{ISBN|9780198208112}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pagenumber|date=March 2018}} Pope Eugene IV issued a [[papal bull]], ''Creator omnium'', on 17 December 1434, annulling previous permission granted to Portugal to conquer those islands still pagan. Eugene excommunicated anyone who enslaved newly converted Christians, the penalty to stand until the captives were restored to their liberty and possessions.&lt;ref name=Raiswell&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&amp;pg=PA260 Raiswell, Richard. "Eugene IV, Papal bulls of", ''The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery'', Junius P. Rodriguez ed., ABC-CLIO, 1997] {{ISBN|9780874368857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Sicut dudum'' ==
Slave raids continued in the islands during 1435 and Eugene issued a further edict (''Sicut dudum'') that affirmed the ban on enslavement,&lt;ref name=Raiswell/&gt; and ordered, under pain of excommunication, that all such slaves be immediately set free:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We order and command all and each of the faithful of each sex, within the space of fifteen days of the publication of these letters in the place where they live, that they restore to their earlier liberty all and each person of either sex who were once residents of said Canary Islands, and made captives since the time of their capture, and who have been made subject to slavery. These people are to be totally and perpetually free, and are to be let go without the exaction or reception of money.&lt;ref name=Panzer&gt;Panzer, Joel S., Appendix B of Fr. Joel S. Panzer's book, "The Popes and Slavery", Appendix B, Society of St. Paul, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eugene went on to say that, "''If this is not done when the fifteen days have passed, they incur the sentence of excommunication by the act itself, from which they cannot be absolved, except at the point of death, even by the Holy See, or by any Spanish bishop, or by the aforementioned Ferdinand, unless they have first given freedom to these captive persons and restored their goods.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Eugene04/eugene04sicut.htm Pope Eugene IV, ''Sicut Dudm'', §4, Florence, 13 January 1435]&lt;/ref&gt; The specific reference to Spanish bishops and Bishop Ferdinand of San Marcial del Rubicón in Lanzarote suggests that the Portuguese were not the only ones engaged in slave raids in the Canaries.

Joel S. Panzer views ''Sicut dudum'' as a significant condemnation of slavery, issued sixty years before the Europeans found the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchinhistory.org/pages/booklets/slavery.htm Panzer, Joel S., "The Popes and Slavery", ''Homiletic &amp; Pastoral Review'', December 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene tempered ''Sicut dudum'' with another bull (15 September 1436) due to the complaints made by King [[Duarte of Portugal]], that allowed the Portuguese to conquer any unconverted parts of the Canary Islands. The king suggested that Portugal be authorized to evangelize and civilize the islands, as other less reputable persons were unlikely to heed the pontiff. Political weakness compelled the Renaissance Papacy to adopt an acquiescent and unchallenging position when approached for requests for privileges in favour of these ventures.&lt;ref name=Housley/&gt; Without a navy of his own to police the islands, the Pope opted in favor of the Portuguese as the lesser of two evils.&lt;ref name=Stogre&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c72sjS0RiY4C&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=Piis+fidelium+1493&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WmSzaqsh23&amp;sig=Fyn2s271JtA5_8xAudlt64e5MiE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7ZnaU_WeK42TyAThk4GYCw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Piis%20fidelium%201493&amp;f=false Stogre, Michael.

In 1476 Pope Sixtus IV reiterated the concerns expressed in "Sicut dudum" in his papal bull, ''Regimini gregis'', in which he threatened to excommunicate all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians.

'''Sidney Rittenberg''' ({{zh|c=李敦白|p=Lǐ Dūnbái}}; born August 14, 1921) is an [[List of American print journalists|American journalist]], scholar, and Chinese linguist who lived in [[China]] from 1944 to 1980. He worked closely with [[Mao Zedong]], [[Zhu De]],  [[Zhou Enlai]], and other leaders of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) during the war, and was with these central Communist leaders at [[Yan'an]]. He witnessed first-hand much of what occurred at upper levels of the CCP and knew many of its leaders personally. Later, he was imprisoned in [[solitary confinement]], twice, for a total of 16 years.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;Michael Bristow, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13974472 'Sidney Rittenberg: Chairman Mao's Favourite American'], BBC, 30 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first [[United States|American]] citizen to join the CCP.&lt;ref name=nyt710&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/the-man-who-stayed-behind-in-china-comes-forward/?ref=china |title=The Man Who Stayed Behind in China Comes Into Focus
|author= MARK MCDONALD |publisher=New York Times |date=2012-07-10 |accessdate=2012-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rittenberg's connections and experience have enabled him to run a successful consultancy business representing some of the world's biggest brands, such as [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi Strauss]], [[Microsoft]], [[Hughes Aircraft]] and [[Teledesic]].

==Early life==
Rittenberg was born into a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]], and lived there until his college studies. After attending [[Porter-Gaud School|Porter Military Academy]], he turned down a full scholarship to [[Princeton University]] and instead attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he majored in [[philosophy]]. While attending [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|Chapel Hill]], he became a member of the [[Dialectic Society]] and the [[Communist Party of the United States|US Communist Party]]. In 1942, following the entry of the US into [[World War II]]—and after his leaving the Communist Party—Rittenberg joined the [[United States Army|Army]] and was sent to [[Stanford]]'s Army Far Eastern Language and Area School to learn [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Rittenberg did not wish to be assigned to study Japanese, and was able to be assigned to learn [[Chinese language|Chinese]] instead. This led to his being sent to China in 1944. Rittenberg said that one of the turning points in his life came shortly after he arrived in China.  He was sent to bring a $26 check to the family of a girl who was killed by a drunken US soldier. Despite the family's devastation, they gave Rittenberg $6 for his help.  It was at that point that "something inside Sidney Rittenberg shifted."&lt;ref&gt;U-Turn: What If You Woke Up One Morning and Realized You Were Living the Wrong Life, by Bruce Grierson&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war, he decided to stay in China as part of the [[United Nations]] famine relief program. This led to his meeting the leaders of the Communist movement at [[Yan'an]] in 1946.

==Yan'an==
At [[Yan'an]], Rittenberg observed the comradeship of CCP leaders, but ran afoul of the small city's strict moral regimen. Rittenberg's memoirs relay his impressions as a young man seeking the acceptance not accorded to him as a leftist labor organizer in South Carolina. Although isolated in the [[loess]] caves of the arid northwest, Yan'an was the site of intense introspection by urban intellectuals like Rittenberg, whose first sustained contact with Chinese communism occurred in Yan'an's uniquely isolated setting. Yan'an was also the site of an ongoing [[Yan'an Rectification Movement]] launched by [[Mao Zedong]] in the previous year. Artists—cartoonists and novelists in particular—were falling under the influence of Mao, whose nascent [[personality cult]] Rittenberg soon began to observe. More immediately than Chairman Mao, however, a young female cadre soon lured Rittenberg into a romantic liaison which was immediately exposed and nearly resulted in his expulsion from Yan'an. With the slow but inexorable march toward civil war in 1946, Rittenberg would be drawn out, and into the next phase of his involvement with the Chinese Communist Party.

==Interpreting for Mao==
Twice, Rittenberg interpreted a message for the United States from [[Mao Zedong]]. The message was the same both times. Mao said that after the war was over in China, and after Mao became the leader of the country, he wanted to still have a good relationship with the United States. This was for two reasons: first, because the United States was the only country that could supply him with the money he needed to rebuild the country; second, because Mao did not wish to depend on the Soviets. Both times this message was delivered it was rejected by President Truman. Rittenberg believes that had Truman decided to talk to Mao, both the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]] could possibly have been averted.

The Communist Party leadership sought Rittenberg's assistance in translating their messages into English, including the writings of Mao. Rittenberg also worked for the [[Xinhua News Agency]] and [[Radio Peking]].&lt;ref name=nyt710/&gt;

==First imprisonment==
In 1949, Rittenberg was thrown into solitary confinement for supposedly being a member of a local [[spy]] network connected with an international spy network "uncovered" in the Soviet Union. For one year, he was kept in a completely dark room, and was kept for five years after that before he was finally released. Rittenberg attributes his survival in solitary confinement to a poem by [[Edwin Markham]]:&lt;ref&gt;Geeks &amp; geezers: how era, values, and defining moments shape leaders, by Warren G. Bennis, Robert J. Thomas&lt;/ref&gt;

:''They drew a circle that shut me out
:''Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout
:''But love and I had the wit to win;
:''We drew a circle that took them in.

Rittenberg recalled hearing this poem from his sister when he was sick as a child, and, upon his imprisonment, it came back to him, and he used it to build relationships with the prison guards and managed to convince them to provide him with books and a candle to read.

In 1955, he was released, which he attributes to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death.

== Cultural Revolution ==
During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Rittenberg was radicalised and in the summer of 1967 headed the "[[Norman Bethune]] - Yan'an rebel group",&lt;ref&gt;Chinese: 白求恩－延安造反团&lt;/ref&gt; which had about seventy members. He led political struggles at [[China Radio International]]. [[Han Suyin]] at that time said that Rittenberg was in complete control of the radio station. On April 8, 1967, the [[People's Daily]] published a long article written by him.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese: [http://hi.baidu.com/lishilaoshi/blog/item/ee8fe1c448c6e2a88326ac78.html 中国文化大革命打开了通向共产主义的航道]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, he represented a faction of foreigners in struggle session against [[Wang Guangmei]] at [[Tsinghua University]]. He also attacked other foreigners who were living in Beijing at that time, including Ma Haide ([[George Hatem]]). Ma Haide had advised Rittenberg not to interfere in Chinese political affairs.

==Second imprisonment==
After several people were labelled as "516 elements" in September 1967, foreigners also became targets of that campaign and were labelled "516 elements" and foreign spies. A poster with the title "How an American seized red power at Radio China International" was put up at the radio station, and Rittenberg was also criticised in a poster at the Friendship Hotel, where many foreigners were living.

In February 1968, several members of the "Norman Bethune - Yan'an rebel group" were arrested, among them [[Israel Epstein]] and his wife Elsie Fairfax-Cholmeley, Michael Shapiro and Rittenberg. This time, the reason for his arrest was supposed actions and criticisms against the [[dictatorship]] and [[bureaucracy]]. He was also charged with maintaining connections with the "Chinese [[Nikita Khrushchev]]" [[Liu Shaoqi]], whom Rittenberg had strongly criticised in the previous campaigns.  His wife, Wang Yulin was sent to a "May Seventh Cadre School".  During his stay he penned a new [[Confucian]] saying: "Man who climbs out on limb should listen carefully for sound of saw."  According to him, he did not hear the saw until it was too late.

On [[International Women's Day]], March 8, 1973, there was a reception for foreign experts in the [[Great Hall of the People]], most of whom had been released by that time. Zhou Enlai spoke and apologised to the foreigners, but also said: "There are also some foreigners who during the Cultural Revolution participated in a certain organisation, who participated in destructive activities of bad elements. Sidney Rittenberg is one of those people; he was involved in the counterrevolutionary clique of Wang Li, Guan Feng and [[Qi Benyu]]."

In November 1977, Rittenberg was released and rehabilitated — probably as the last of all the foreigners. In March 1980, he moved back to the United States.

==Present day==
Rittenberg is a faculty member in the Chinese Studies Program at [[Pacific Lutheran University]]. He is married to Yulin, and has four children.  In 1993, he wrote a book about his experiences in China entitled ''The Man Who Stayed Behind'', with the aid of Amanda Bennett.

Rittenberg and his wife operate Rittenberg &amp; Associates, a consulting firm that provides assistance to businesses who work with Chinese companies.  Some of their best-known clients included [[Billy Graham]] and [[Mike Wallace]].  Rittenberg frequently speaks about his experiences in [[China]], and is currently living on [[Fox Island, Washington|Fox Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. In an interview in 2008, he criticized the [[neoconservative]] and the Bush administration's view of China as a threat.

In 2012, Irv Drasnin, Lucy Ostrander, and Don Sellers produced a documentary about Rittenberg called ''[http://revolutionarymovie.com/index.html The Revolutionary]''. Rittenberg and the producers spoke about his experiences and the film at the USC's US-China Institute in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2833 Q and A Following the Screening of the Revolutionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Jew in the Lotus''''' is a 1994 book by [[Rodger Kamenetz]] about a historic dialogue between [[rabbi]]s and the [[Dalai Lama]], the first recorded major dialogue between experts in [[Judaism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kamenetz|first1=Rodger|title=The Jew in the lotus : a poet's rediscovery of Jewish identity in Buddhist India|date=1995|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|location=[San Francisco, Calif.]|isbn=978-0060645748|edition= 1st HarperCollins paperback.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was a popular success and became an international best-seller. Writing in the [[New York Times]], [[Verlyn Klinkenborg]] cited its broader relevance as a book "about the survival of esoteric traditions in a world bent on destroying them." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klinkenborg|first=Verlyn|title=Going to See the Lama|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/books/going-to-see-the-lama.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 24, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was primarily potent in capturing an ongoing engagement in the US between Jews, often highly secularized, and Buddhist teachings. Kamenetz popularized the term [[Jewish Buddhist|JUBU]] or [[Jewish Buddhist]], interviewing poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[vipassana]] teacher [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], [[Ram Dass]] and other American Jews involved with bringing Eastern traditions to the West.  The book also made prominent a Jewish mystical response to Eastern spirituality in the [[Jewish renewal]] movement, led by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]], and [[Jewish meditation]] as taught by Rabbi Jonathan Omer-Man. The title is a pun on the Vajrayana mantra ''[[Om mani padme hum]]'' which is frequently interpreted as "hail to the jewel in the lotus".

First published in 1994 by Harper San Francisco, it is now on its 37th reprint. In fall of 2007 the paperback was reissued with an afterword that updated readers on Jewish-Buddhist dialogues.
'''The Jew in the Lotus''' inspired a PBS documentary of the same name produced and directed by Laurel Chiten, released theatrically in New York, Los Angeles and Boston, and subsequently on Independent Lens on   September 1, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ITVS|title=The Jew in the Lotus|url=http://www.itvs.org/films/jew-in-the-lotus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peace pipe.jpg|thumb|240px|alt=ceremonial pipe stem|Decorated stem of a [[ceremonial pipe]].]]

'''The red road''' is a modern, [[English language|English-language]] concept of the right path of life, as inspired by some of the beliefs found in a variety of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] spiritual teachings.&lt;ref name=Pritchard1&gt;Evan T Pritchard, ''Native American Stories of the Sacred: Annotated &amp; Explained,'' Sky Light Illuminations: 2005. Quote: "[[Black Elk]], in ''The Sacred Pipe'', speaks of the Red Road as the north-south cross of the Medicine Wheel, and the east-west cross as the black or blue road, the way we ..."&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used primarily in the [[Pan-Indian]] and [[New Age]] communities,&lt;ref name="rainbow"&gt;McGaa, Ed, ''Rainbow Tribe: Ordinary People Journeying on the Red Road''. HarperCollins, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PDeloria"&gt;Deloria, Philip J., ''Playing Indian''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-300-08067-4}}. Chapter Six: "Counterculture Indians and the New Age"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huhndorf"&gt;Huhndorf, Shari Michelle, ''Going Native: Indians in the American Cultural Imagination''. Cornell University Press, 2001. p.164&lt;/ref&gt; and rarely among traditional Indigenous people,&lt;ref name="PDeloria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huhndorf"/&gt; who have terms in their own languages for their spiritual ways.&lt;ref name=Pritchard2&gt;''Native American Stories of the Sacred: Annotated &amp; Explained'', 2005- Page xi "One unifying feature of Native American belief is the concept of the "Red Road," though each tribe and nation also has its own name for it. Black Elk speaks of the Red Road in the book The Sacred Pipe."&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans' spiritual teachings are diverse. While some peoples share common elements in their beliefs, the cultures are highly individualized. The ceremonies and many of the beliefs are unique to the people of these diverse bands, tribes and nations.&lt;ref name=Pritchard2/&gt;

==Black Elk==
In his book ''[[Black Elk Speaks]],'' [[John G. Neihardt]] explored spiritual beliefs as he says they were told to him  by [[Black Elk]] (1863–1950), an [[Oglala Lakota]].&lt;ref name="Neihardt"&gt;Neihardt, John G. (1932, William Morrow &amp; Company) ''[[Black Elk Speaks]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Neihardt is non-Native. In the late 20th century, his work was criticized as diverging from, and misrepresenting, Lakota beliefs and ceremonies.&lt;ref name="DeMallie"&gt;DeMallie, Raymond (Nebraska University Press, 1985). ''The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk's Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt'', {{ISBN|0803265646}}. Introduction and notes throughout the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silvio"&gt;[http://www.ipl.org.ar/cgi-bin/ref/litcrit/litcrit.out.pl?ti=bla-680 Carl Silvio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007023844/http://www.ipl.org.ar/cgi-bin/ref/litcrit/litcrit.out.pl?ti=bla-680 |date=2007-10-07 }}, [[Internet Public Library]], academic arguments on authorship, translation, and interpretation for prospective audiences have been written by Carl Silvio, among others.  Note: This site has been superseded since 2010 by www.ipl2.org, a consortium of universities, accessed 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neihardt said that Black Elk believed he had an obligation to "help to bring my people back into the sacred hoop, that they might again walk the red road in a sacred manner pleasing to the powers of the universe that are one power."&lt;ref&gt;Willis Goth Regier, ''Masterpieces of American Indian Literature''. U of Nebraska Press, 2005, p. 580. {{ISBN|0-8032-8997-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hear me, four quarters of the world--a relative I am! Give me the strength to walk the soft earth, a relative to all that is! Give me the eyes to see and the strength to understand, that I may be like you. With your power only can I face the winds.&lt;br&gt;
[[Great Spirit]], Great Spirit, my Grandfather, all over the earth the faces of living things are all alike. With tenderness have these come up out of the ground. Look upon these faces of children without number and with children in their arms, that they may face the wind and walk the good road to the day of quiet.&lt;br&gt;
This is my prayer; hear me now!"

- "Black Elk's Prayer for All Life"&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/twalker/blckelk4.htm Walker, "A Social Ethical Analysis of BLACK ELK SPEAKS"], [[Southern Methodist University]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Treatment of addictions==
In some modern addiction treatment programs, the idea of the Red Road may be part of the recovery process. Some of these programs are primarily for Native populations, but take a [[Pan-Indianism|Pan-Indian]] or [[New Age]] approach, through "the [[Sweat lodge]], the Red Road, and the Recovery Medicine Wheel."&lt;ref&gt;RD VICK, LM Smith, CIR Herrera - The healing circle: An alternative path to alcoholism recovery  ''Counseling and Values'', 1998 - Wiley Online Library "... Therefore, the incorporation of tribal spiritual teachings and practices into the recovery process can be crucial to its success. Three elements are central to the recovery process: the Sweat Lodge, the Red Road, and the Recovery Medicine Wheel."&lt;/ref&gt; Other "Red Road to Recovery" programs are not run by or for Native people, but are groups of predominantly non-Native, New Age adherents. 

==Mainstream usage==
The phrase "The Red Road" has been picked up by many non-Native adherents of [[New Age]] and [[hippie]] lifestyles, based on their interpretation of Native American spirituality.&lt;ref name="rainbow"/&gt; Critics have accused such followers of [[cultural appropriation]] and misrepresentation.&lt;ref name="PDeloria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huhndorf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldred"&gt;Aldred, Lisa, "Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality" in: ''The American Indian Quarterly'' issn.24.3 (2000) pp.329-352.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2460">'''Tianzhu''' (Chinese: 天主, Tiānzhǔ), meaning "Heavenly Master" or "Lord of Heaven," was the Chinese word used by the [[Jesuit China missions]] to designate [[God]].&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CRArQFHGfn8C&amp;pg=PA73 ''Manufacturing Confucianism: Chinese traditions &amp; universal civilization'' by Lionel M. Jensen p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The word first appeared in [[Michele Ruggieri]]'s Chinese translation of the ''[[Decalogo]]'', or ''Ten Commandments''.&lt;ref name="Jensen" /&gt; In 1584, Ruggieri and [[Matteo Ricci]] published their first catechism, ''Tiānzhǔ shílù'' (天主實錄, ''The Veritable Record of the Lord of Heaven'').&lt;ref name="O'Malley"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hzbsz3TOsZAC&amp;pg=PA365 ''The Jesuits: cultures, sciences, and the arts, 1540-1773, Volume 1'' by John W. O'Malley p.365]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matteo Ricci]] later wrote a [[catechism]] entitled ''Tiānzhŭ Shíyì'' (天主實義, ''The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven'').&lt;ref name="Jensen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Malley"/&gt;

Following the [[Chinese rites controversy]], the term ''Tiānzhŭ'' was officially adopted by the [[Pope]] in 1715, who rejected alternative terms such as ''[[Tian|Tiān]]'' (天, "Heaven") and ''[[Shangdi|Shàngdì]]'' (上帝, "Supreme Emperor").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw1TV4VvY8IC&amp;pg=PA52 ''Chinese Christians in America: conversion, assimilation, and adhesive identities'' by Fenggang Yang p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Catholicism]]" is most commonly rendered as ''Tiānzhǔjiào'' (天主教, "Religion of the Lord of Heaven").  An individual Catholic is ''[[Tianzhu jiaotu|Tiānzhŭjiào tú]]'';&lt;ref&gt;"Catholic", in ''Collins Chinese Concise Dictionary'' (2006), New York:  HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt; ''tú'' includes the meanings "disciple" and "believer."&lt;ref&gt;"tú" in ''Collins Chinese Concise Dictionary'' (2006), New York:  HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt; The same ''[[hanja]]'' characters are used in the Korean words for Catholicism and Catholic believer.

{{Vajrayana}}
A '''bajracharya''' or '''vajracharya''' (lit. "[[vajra]] carrier") is a [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhist]] priest among the [[Newar]] communities of [[Nepal]] and a Revered Teacher who is highly attained in Vajrayana practices and rituals.  Vajracharya means "vajra carrier". They are also commonly called '''guru-ju''' or '''gu-bhaju''' (a short form for guru bhaju) which are Nepali terms related to the Sanskrit term [[guru]], and translate as "teacher" or "priest". The bajracharya is the highest ranking of the Newar [[caste]]s that are born Buddhist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hattaway|first=Paul|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Diary|publisher=William Carey Library|year=2004|pages=198|isbn=0-87808-361-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzEOKNPsv2EC&amp;dq=Bajracharya+Buddhist&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of vajracharya institution is ascribed to the decline of celibate Buddhist monks in about 13th century, and the emergence of Vajrayana.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KoNT6tjk9mQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Vajracharya+caste&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eyxAVY_ALo7SoASWzIHQCw&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Vajracharya%20caste&amp;f=false A History of Nepal, John Whelpton, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 30]&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a professional Guruju, a person of the bajracharya caste must go through a number of rituals. The bajracharya boy goes through a ritualistic process of [[initiation]] known as ''bajravishekha'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bajracharya.org/nepalibuddhism.htm|title=A Brief Introduction of Distinctive Features of Nepalese Buddhism|year=2002|accessdate=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; including shaving off the head as the [[buddhahood|buddha]] and asking for [[alms]], at a minimum of seven houses a day in different places, in the tradition of [[bhikku|monks]] since the time of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Sometimes  [[tantras|tantric]] [[Newar Buddhism]] and Esoteric Buddhism is referred to as "Vajracharya Buddhism".

The writers of ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-century Nepal'' explore the unusual relationship of the vajracharyas and their assistant shakyas with [[Buddhist monasticism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;, Unlike Vajracharyas, Shakya men may not be priests for others, but together with Vajracharya men they are the members of the traditional Newar Buddhist monasteries, known honorifically as vihara and colloquially as Baha or Bahi. In so far as Shakya and Vajracharya men filled their roles in the monastery, they were monks. In effect, they were married, part-time monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah LeVine, David N. Gellner|title=Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-century Nepal|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2005|page=37|isbn=978-0-674-01908-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9C1iF3MAYgC&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the modern Buddhist scholars in Nepal belong to the vajracharya tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l3KmWbcq5foC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=pandit+vajracharya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jy5AVexWk7ihBIu2gNAK&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pandit%20vajracharya&amp;f=false The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art, John C. Huntington, Dina Bangdel, Robert A. F. Thurman, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Columbus Museum of Art, Serindia Publications, Inc., 2003, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;
There are several legendary vajracharya priests from different parts of Kathmandu valley. Shatikaracharya, a king who turned into a powerful tantric priest and disappeared inside the cave in Shantipur Swoyambhu is well known for his expertise in vajrayana buddhist practice. He is still believed to be dwelling inside the Shantipura cave performing intense sadhana.
Vajracharya Bandhudutta, who was a disciple of the legendary Shatikaracharya, is credited with bringing lord lokesvara form kamaru kamakhya Askam, in Kathmandu valley. Leela Vajra, a Buddhist priest from sakhu is believed to have built kasthamandap from the wood obtained from kalpabrikshhya  ( wish fulfilling tree)
Similarly Surata Vajra, Vak Vajra, Sashwot Vajra, Manjuvajra ( Jamana Gubhaju) etc. are some of the famous Vajracharya priests whose folklores of magical and mystical deeds are popular among the people of Kathmandu valley

'''Zhizha''' ({{zh|t=紙紮|s=纸扎|p=zhǐzā}}), or '''Taoist paper art''', is a type of traditional craft, mainly used as offerings in [[Taoism|Taoist]] festive celebrations and funerals. It had become a widely accepted element in religious practice since Northern [[Song Dynasty]]. It now faces a gradual loss of craftsmanship due to related environmental concerns and weakened superstitions.

== Origin ==

Zhizha is generally perceived as a form of offering in festive celebrations and funerals. It is believed to be a substitute for living offerings in a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjfeiyi.com/showminsu.asp?id=247 |title=纸扎艺术 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126214859/http://bjfeiyi.com/showminsu.asp?id=247 |archivedate=January 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young women in ancient China were offered as brides every year to a so called “River God” in exchange for less frequent floods. To facilitate the exchange, the women would be sacrificed. This practice was later halted by Ximen Bao of Wei due to ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_26349.htm |title=Ximen Bao. |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174603/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_26349.htm |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhizha is the present form of offerings. It only appeared after the maturation of papermaking skills in the [[Han dynasty]]. Its common usage came to reality in Northern Song Dynasty, when burning zhǐmǎ (paper dolls in the shape of animals) and zhǐyǒng (paper tomb figures) became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjfeiyi.com/showminsu.asp?id=247 |title=纸扎艺术 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126214859/http://bjfeiyi.com/showminsu.asp?id=247 |archivedate=January 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Effigies, which were often produced purposefully to resemble humans, took varied forms in different periods of time, from couch grass, terracotta, and eventually paper. 

== Usage ==

Zhizha art plays an important role in Chinese culture. Despite being one of the most important kinds of decorations in villages, it also serves as an important medium of communication between humans and gods in different forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/History/zh_TW/web/mh/publications/spa_2010-08-23_01.html |title=從紙紮用品看香港民俗文化 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zhizha art is mostly for festive or funeral decoration and offerings. During festivals which perform the Taoist ritual, “[[Dajiao]]”, Zhizha is used to make symbolic decorations such as lanterns, the models of mythic creatures and Gods in parades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= |title=JOURNEY THROUGH HISTORY: A MODERN COURSE 1 |publisher=ARISTO EDUCATIONAL PRESS LTD. |date=2003 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Ghost Festival]] and [[Qingming Festival]], apart from [[joss paper]], people burn Zhizha offerings to worship gods and show respect to the ghosts of the deceased. While similarly, Zhizha is essential for a traditional Taoist funeral. Since the Chinese generally believe in an afterlife, anything needed for the deceased to enjoy their afterlives, such as houses, furniture, food, gadgets and even servants will be made into Zhizha models and burned as offerings to them.

=== Materials and structure ===

[[Bamboo]] and colored paper are used to prepare Zhizha. The manufacturing process of different offerings are similar, but for large and complex Zhizha, the production process is more time-consuming and more complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sky-home.tw/txt.asp |title=online zhizha shop |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404010221/http://www.sky-home.tw/txt.asp |archivedate=April 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


Generally, to create a Zhiza, the first step is to draft the appearance on a graph. Then, the paper is cut and torn into the desired shape. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiculture.net/20511/html/c19/20511c19.html |title=中國民間藝術 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form for support made by bamboo is needed on which to glue the colored paper. It is possible to alter the shape of Zhizha to the desired form. Therefore, a large variety of Zhizha products such as apartment, mobile phones, laptops, vehicles, etc, can be made. 

== Zhizha evolution ==

Comparing Zhizha in the past to modern Zhizha, there are differences in its types and production processes.

=== Types of Product ===

In the past, the types of Zhizha is simpler, as Zhizha craftsmen made products that fulfilled basic human needs for clothing, food, shelter and transportation. Common types of Zhizha includes mansions, servants, paper money and sedan chair.{{what|date=March 2016}} People believe that burning these kinds of necessities to their ancestors can ensure them a better afterlife. However, there are various types of Zhizha like iPhones, iPads and also branded products like [[Prada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiculture.net/20511/html/c19/20511c19.html |title=Super-market of the dead |publisher= |date=2015-08-27 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production Method ===

In terms of the production process, most of Zhizha in the past was hand-made, and the production cost was generally high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenage.hk/b5/ga/ga_article.php?article_id=674 |title=紙紮進化論 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Zhizha work has shifted to factories in China for mass production so as to lower the cost. "Though most people can buy paper-made offerings in local stores, a quick look at taobao.com, the most popular online shopping mall in China, reveals a wide choice of paper-made items from mini-houses, Mercedes Benz cars, passports and LV suitcases to iPads and iPhones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiculture.net/20511/html/c19/20511c19.html |title=Super-market of the dead |publisher= |date=2015-08-27 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhizha therefore evolves with the era.

== Craftsmanship ==

The craftsmen who produced Zhizha are usually recognised as zhācǎi jiàng (扎彩匠 in Chinese). Skills are passed down to the disciples from “sifus” (“masters”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1200960/talking-dead-art-making-taoist-paper-effigies
|title=Talking to the dead: the art of making Taoist paper effigies. |publisher= |date=2013-03-27 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Zhizha is [[Taoism]]-based, a Taoist priest can be a Zhizha craftsman. They learn the craftsmanship while handling their priestly duties simultaneously. The production of paper crafts is considered as an inferior duty, thus they are often assigned to the young priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= |title=Up in Flames: The Ephemeral Art of Pasted-paper Sculpture in Taiwan |publisher= United States: Stanford University Press.|date=2004 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As revealed by Chan and Bok, Zhizha, as a kind of traditional craft, is declining at present. One of the contributing factors is the low entry rate of new craftsmen into the industry. The growing disbelief in the afterlife, and increased awareness of the pollutive nature of burning Zhizha offerings are believed the main reasons behind the decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1200960/talking-dead-art-making-taoist-paper-effigies|title=Talking to the dead: the art of making Taoist paper effigies. |publisher= |date=2013-03-27 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Śarīra''' is a generic term referring to Buddhist [[relic]]s, although in common usage it usually refers to [[pearl]] or [[crystal]]-like [[bead]]-shaped objects that are purportedly found among the [[cremation|cremated]] ashes of Buddhist spiritual masters. Relics of the Buddha after cremation are termed ''dhātu'' in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html "Maha-parinibbana Sutta,"]&lt;/ref&gt; Śarīra are held to emanate or incite 'blessings' and 'grace' (Sanskrit: [[adhiṣṭhāna]]) within the [[mindstream]] and experience of those connected to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Dan|title=Pearls from Bones: Relics, Chortens, Tertons and the Signs of Saintly Death in Tibet|journal=Numen|date=September 1994|volume=41|issue=3|pages=274|doi=10.2307/3270352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarira are also [[apotropaic magic|believed to ward off evil]] in the Himalayan Buddhist tradition.

==Terminology==
Śarīra originally meant "body" in Sanskrit, but when used in [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit]] texts to mean "relics", it is always used in the plural: śarīrāḥ.  The term ''ringsel'' is a [[loanword]] from the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]]. Both of these terms are ambiguous in English; they are generally used as synonyms, although according to some interpretations, ringsels are a subset of śarīras.

Śarīra can refer to:
* [[Dharmakāya]] śarīra, which are [[sutra]]s as told by the Buddha. According to [[Ding Fubao]]'s ''Dictionary of Buddhist Terms'', a Dharma body śarīra is "the Sutra as told by the Buddha: That which is unchanging in what is told by the Buddha, is of the same property as the essence of the Buddha himself, hence it is called the 'dharma body śarīra'".
* Remains of the Buddha or other spiritual masters, either cremated remains or other pieces, including a finger bone or a preserved body, similar to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Incorruptibility|incorruptibles]]. Full body śarīra refers to [[Buddhist mummies]], the mummified remains of spiritual masters.
* Broken-body śarīras refers specifically to cremated remains.
* When used without qualification, it generally refers to the pearl-like remnant of a master left after cremation.

==Pearl-like śarīras==
Although the term śarīra can be used to refer to a wide variety of Buddhist relics, as listed above, it is generally used to refer to [[pearl]] or [[crystal]]-like [[bead]]-shaped objects that are purportedly found among the cremated ashes of Buddhist spiritual masters.

These objects are considered relics of significant importance in many sects of [[Buddhism]] since they are believed to embody the spiritual knowledge, teachings, realizations or living essence of spiritual masters. They are taken as evidence of the masters' [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] and spiritual purity. Some believe that śarīras are deliberately left by the consciousness of a master for veneration, and that the beauty of the śarīras depends on how well the masters had cultivated their mind and souls. Śarīra come in a variety of colours, and some are even translucent.

Sariras are typically displayed in a glass bowl inside small gold urns or [[stupa]]s as well as enshrined inside the master's statue. Śarīras are also believed to mysteriously multiply while inside their containers if they have been stored under favorable conditions. [[Saffron]] threads are sometimes placed within or around the bowl containing individual śarīra as an offering.

In the Korean ''[[Samguk yusa]]'' it is said that the monk Myojong received a śarīra from a turtle which caused others to treat the monk better.&lt;ref&gt;[[Il-yeon]]: ''Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea'', translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 100f. Silk Pagoda (2006). {{ISBN|1-59654-348-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occurrence of śarīra is not restricted to ancient times, and many Buddhists have shown that śarīra are not limited to humans or masters. Many texts of [[Pure Land Buddhism]] report śarīras of many adherents, some occurring recently. Some Buddhists associate a student's spiritual life with the amount and condition of the śarīra they leave after cremation. Many Pure Land Buddhists believe [[Amitābha]]'s power manifests cremated remains into śarīra. Many claim that pearls of śarīra rain at the funerals of eminent monks. There are reports that śarīra may appear, multiply or disappear, depending on a keeper's thoughts. One's vow may also be important. One legend holds that the translator [[Kumārajīva]] wanted to demonstrate that his translations were not false; as a result his tongue remained intact after cremation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Explanations==
[[File:Relics of buddha from His Holiness Supreme Patriarch of Thailand 2012.jpg|thumb|Relics of buddha from His Holiness Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]]

There is evidence that under certain conditions of heating, human bones can form crystalline structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7665130 | volume=74 | issue=1-2 | title=Scanning electron microscope observations of heat-treated human bone |date=June 1995 | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | pages=29–45 | doi=10.1016/0379-0738(95)01735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one chemical analysis, śarīras were found to be composed of the constituent elements of both bones and stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forshang.org/000forshangintro/forshangintroc.htm |title=A Brief Introduction of Forshang World Foundation |publisher=Forshang.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary films==
Pearl relics are documented in the 2008 film, ''[[Unmistaken Child]]'', among the cremation ashes of [[Geshe Lama Konchog]].

==In Javanese language==
Javanese has a strong historical bond with the Hindu tradition and Sanskrit liturgical language. Śarīra is also used in Archaic (Kawi) Javanese, preserving its original meaning of 'body' or 'human body'. The word also finds its way into the modern Javanese language as "slira" with the same meaning. "Sliramu" (strictly translated as 'your body') and "sliraku" (strictly translated as 'my body') are usually used in poems or songs to replace "you" and "I", respectively. The word is not common but is used in both oral and written contexts.
