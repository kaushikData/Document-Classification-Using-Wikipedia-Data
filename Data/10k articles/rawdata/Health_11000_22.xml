The '''100K Pathogen Genome Project''' was launched in July 2012 by Bart Weimer (UC Davis) as an academic, public, and private partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burton |first1=Thomas |title=FDA Aims to Track Food-Borne Bacteria's Genetic Codes |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303919504577522874167270932 |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to sequence the genomes of 100,000 infectious microorganisms to create a database of bacterial genome sequences for use in public health, outbreak detection, and bacterial pathogen detection. This will speed up the diagnosis of [[foodborne illness]]es and shorten infectious disease outbreaks.&lt;ref name="fda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm311661.htm |title=FDA, UC Davis, Agilent Technologies and CDC to create publicly available food pathogen genome database |author=Curtis Allen |date=12 July 2012 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=2 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202154000/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm311661.htm |archivedate=2 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 100K Pathogen Genome Project is a public-private collaborative project to sequence the genomes of 100,000 infectious microorganisms. [https://www.wellcomegenomecampus.org/aboutus/genomicsengland.html The 100K Genome Project] will provide a roadmap for developing tests to identify pathogens and trace their origins more quickly.

Partners announced in the launch of the project were [[UC Davis]], [[Agilent Technologies]], and the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], with the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[US Department of Agriculture]] noted as collaborators. As the project has proceeded, the partnership has evolved to include or replace these founding partners. The 100K Pathogen Genome Project was selected by the IBM/Mars Food Safety Consortium for metagenomic sequences.

The 100K Pathogen Genome Project is conducting high-throughput [[next-generation sequencing]] (NGS) to investigate the genomes of targeted [[microorganism]]s, with [[whole genome sequencing]] to be carried out on a small number of microorganisms for use as a reference genome. Most bacterial strains will be sequenced and assembled as draft genomes; however, the project has also produced closed genomes for a variety of enteric pathogens in the 100K bioproject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/186441 |title=100K Food Pathogen Project |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from this project is also available for download at the 100K Pathogen Genome Project [http://100kgenomes.org] website.

This strategy enables worldwide collaboration to identify sets of [[biomarker|genetic biomarkers]] associated with important pathogen traits. This five-year microbial pathogen project will result in a free, public database containing the sequence information for each pathogen's genome. The completed gene sequences will be stored in the [[National Institutes of Health]] ([[NIH]])'s [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] ([[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]])'s public database.&lt;ref name="genomeweb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/100k-genome-project-launched-sequence-genomes-foodborne-waterborne-pathogens |title=100K Genome Project Launched to Sequence Genomes of Foodborne, Waterborne Pathogens |date=12 July 2012 |publisher=Genomeweb LLC |accessdate=2 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202154433/https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/100k-genome-project-launched-sequence-genomes-foodborne-waterborne-pathogens |archivedate=2 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the database, scientists will be able to develop new methods of controlling disease-causing bacteria in the food chain.

[[File:AIDS Clinical Trials Group logo.gif|thumb|right|ACTG logo]]
The '''AIDS Clinical Trials Group''' network (ACTG) is one of the largest [[HIV]] clinical trials organizations in the world, playing a major role in setting standards of care for HIV infection and [[opportunistic diseases]] related to HIV and [[AIDS]] in the [[United States]] and the [[developing world]]. The ACTG is composed of, and directed by, leading clinical scientists in HIV/AIDS therapeutic research. The ACTG is funded by the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], [[National Institutes of Health]] through the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]].

==Mission==
Through innovative studies of the treatment of HIV-1 infection and its complications, ACTG research focuses on:

*New therapies based on knowledge of the cellular events and reactions in the development of disease (pathogenesis) 
*Treatment strategies to limit replication of HIV-1 and improve disease-free survival among infected individuals 
*Rapid development of agents (drugs or treatment strategies) that prevent or delay the complications of HIV-related disorders 
*HIV-1 pathogenesis through advanced laboratory investigation 
*Recruitment and retention of clinical trial participants who reflect the changing demographics of the AIDS epidemic 
*Therapeutic approaches that improve quality of life for persons with HIV-1 infection

==History==
The ACTG has been pivotal{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} in providing the data necessary for the approval of therapeutic agents, as well as treatment and prevention strategies, for many opportunistic infections and malignancies.

:In 1986, the original AIDS Treatment and Evaluation Units were established by the National Institutes of Health. 
:In 1987, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) was established by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
:In 1991, the ACTG divided its focus into two groups and created the Adult ACTG (AACTG) and the Pediatric ACTG (PACTG). 
:In 1995 the AACTG restructured and created a true self-governing structure, with self-evaluation of sites, priority setting of scientific research, discretionary spending. The PACTG became its own group and an AIDS Malignancy Consortium was established under the National Cancer Institute. 
:In 1999 the AACTG applied for continued funding as an investigator led and run group 
:In 2000, the AACTG began the planning and development of international research initiatives in the developing world.
:In 2005, the ACTG opened its first multinational AIDS clinical trial in 16 sites around the globe “A Phase IV, Prospective, Randomized, Open-Label Evaluation of the Efficacy of Once-Daily PI &amp; Once-Daily Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor - Containing Therapy Combinations for Initial Treatment of HIV-1 Infected individuals from Resource - Limited Settings (PEARLS) Trial”, the results of which suggested men and women respond to antiretroviral drugs differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26216">'''Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom''',  also known as the '''ABC strategy''' or '''abstinence-plus sex education''', also known as abstinence-based sex education, is a [[sex education]] policy based on a combination of "risk avoidance" and [[harm reduction]] which modifies the approach of [[abstinence-only sex education]] by including education about the value of partner reduction [[safe sex]] and [[birth control]] methods. Abstinence-only sex education is strictly to promote the sexual abstinence until marriage, and does not teach about safe sex or contraceptives. The abstinence-based sex education program is meant to stress abstinence and include information on safe sex practices. In general terms, this strategy of sex education is a compromise between abstinence-only education and comprehensive sex education. The ABC approach was developed in response to the growing epidemic of [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]], and to prevent the spread of other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. This approach has been credited by some with the falling numbers of those infected with AIDS in Uganda, Kenya and Zimbabwe, among others. From 1990 to 2001 the percentage of Ugandans living with AIDS fell from 15% to between 5 and 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|year=2005|title=ABC in Uganda: success or subterfuge?|url=|journal=HIV/AIDS Policy&amp;Law Review|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Edward C.|last2=Halperin|first2=Daniel T.|last3=Nantulya|first3=Vinand|last4=Hogle|first4=Janice A.|date=2006-05-11|title=Uganda's HIV Prevention Success: The Role of Sexual Behavior Change and the National Response|journal=AIDS and Behavior|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=335–346|doi=10.1007/s10461-006-9073-y|issn=1090-7165|pmc=1544373|pmid=16688475}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fall is believed to result from the employment of the ABC approach, especially reduction in the number of sex partners, called "Zero-Grazing" in Uganda.

Abstinence-based sex education can include issues of human relationships, the basic biology of human reproduction, safe sex methods and contraceptives, [[HIV/AIDS]] information, and masturbation in place of sex. It recommends [[sexual abstinence]] outside marriage as an ideal, having only a single long-term sexual partner. The use of [[condom]]s and other safe sex practices is advocated only if it is not possible to remain with a single sexual partner. Advocating this ideal, whilst pragmatically dealing with the fact that abstinence only sex education is ineffective by itself, has made the ABC approach popular with many African governments and relief agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Edward C.|title=Rethinking AIDS Prevention|type=book |publisher=Preager|year=2003 |oclc=612065556|isbn=978-0865693166}}{{Page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC approach has notably been used in African countries. Versions of this approach have been used for [[abstinence-only sex education in Uganda]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ABC of HIV prevention |publisher=[[AVERT]] |url=http://www.avert.org/abc-hiv.htm|date=2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its positive impact has been confirmed by a 2009 Stanford University survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eran |last1=Bendavid |first2=Jayanta |last2=Bhattacharya |title=The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=19349625 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19349625 |laysummary=http://healthpolicy.stanford.edu/news/stanford_study_first_ever_to_show_us_aids_relief_program_saved_a_million_lives_20090406/ |laysource=[[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]] |laydate=April 6, 2009 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-10-200905190-00117 |year=2009 |volume=150 |issue=10 |pages=688–95 |pmc=2892894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Abstinence, be faithful, use a Condom consists of three components:
*'''Abstinence''': The ABC approach encourages young adults to delay "sexual debut" (age of first sexual intercourse), or to use abstinence until marriage, the most effective way to avoid HIV infection, as advocated as the ideal by Christianity.  The program develops skills for practicing abstinence and encourages participants to adopt social norms that support abstinence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  
*'''Be Faithful''': In addition to abstinence, the ABC approach encourages participants to eliminate casual or other concurrent sex partners and to practice fidelity within their marriages and other sexual relationships.  This reduces exposure to HIV..{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* '''Use a Condom''': The Catholic Church has publicly stated its opposition to condom use. However, in 2010, during an interview, Pope Benedict XVI addressed the use of condoms and his view that condoms are the "first step" of morality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bengiano|first=Giuseppe|last2=Carrara|first2=Sabina|last3=Filipi|first3=Valentina|last4=Brosens|first4=Ivo|year=2011|title=Condoms, HIV and the Roman Catholic Church|url=|journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online|volume=22|pages=701–709|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Starting primarily in the 1980s and 1990s, the popularity of the "abstinence plus" sex education program grew into a common method of teaching students, in the [[United States]], about sexuality. The program understood that it would not be possible to stop all teenagers from having sex, but still stressed that abstinence is the only guaranteed way of avoiding unwanted pregnancies and contraction of STDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ashbee |first=Edward |title=The Bush Administration, Sex and the Moral Agenda |location=New York |publisher=Manchester UP |year=2007 |pages=102–36 |isbn=978-0-7190-7277-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important message to teens from the program comes from [[Joycelyn Elders]], [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton's]] first [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], that "if they have a baby there is an 80% likelihood they'll be poor, ignorant, and slaves for the rest of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;"Illegitimate rhetoric- Clinton administration's policies towards sex education", ''National Review'' (15 August 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] established a "Girl Power!" campaign focusing on girls ages 9–14 which encouraged abstinence as a form of empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE NATIONAL STRATEGY TO PREVENT OUT-OF-WEDLOCK TEEN PREGNANCIES|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/teenp/strategy.htm|work=aspe.hhs.gov|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who would reject abstinence, or have early sex forced upon them, abstinence-only messages provided little to no hope to prevent pregnancy and spread of disease. To account for this, some states included information about contraceptives in their sex education programs along with encouragement for students to be abstinent. Of the states that, in 1995, required abstinence education, fourteen also included the use of contraception within the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=327–39 |doi=10.1016/S0190-7409(97)00021-2 |title=Sex Education and Abstinence: Programs and Evaluation |year=1997 |last1=Besharov |first1=Douglas J. |last2=Gardiner |first2=Karen N. |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=19 |issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1995, [[Hawaii]] passed the Abstinence-Based Education Policy. (Policy # 2110). It is meant to support abstinence and help develop skills to continue abstinence, help teens who have had sexual intercourse to abstain from further, and to provide teens with information on contraceptives and methods for preventing sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lilinote.k12.hi.us/STATE/BOE/POL1.NSF/85255a0a0010ae82852555340060479d/1bb88fd5ec2ea5940a2566a3000110ef?OpenDocument|title=Abstinence-Based Education Policy|publisher=Hawaii State Government|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the federal government increased funding for state abstinence education as an inclusion of the Welfare Reform Act, creating Title V, and the abstinence-only-until-marriage program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Jillian B.|last2=Packham|first2=Analisa|year=2016|title=The Effects of State-Mandated Abstinence-Based Sex Education on Teen Health Outcomes|url=|journal=Health Economics|volume=26|issue=4|pages=403–420|doi=10.1002/hec.3315|pmid=26918400|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in abstinence funding created incentives for states to maintain these rulings, which over 20 states have.

In 2006 and 2007, $176 million was given annually to abstinence-only programs, whose central message was to delay sexual activity until marriage, preventing the inclusion of information about safe-sex practices or contraception.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|year=2011|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e24658|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|via=|pmid=22022362|pmc=3194801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 2009, funding was cut off for abstinence-only education programs, with no further fund allocated in the 2010 FY budget, and the push for evidence-based sex education and teen pregnancy prevention programs. However, on September 29, 2009 funding was restored to abstinence-only programs, as well as leaving the decision of what sex education program would be taught in public schools up to the individual states&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The state of Texas, where the law states that comprehensive sex education is allowed to be taught, but 94% of school districts have been reported to use abstinence-only sex education, developed an abstinence-plus sex education program called ''Big Decisions'', which not only emphasized abstinence to high school students, but integrated education about condom use and contraception, contradicting the majority of the school districts' decisions to maintain an abstinence-only education program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Realini|first=Janet P.|last2=Buzi|first2=Ruth S.|last3=Smith|first3=Peggy B.|last4=Martinez|first4=Mario|year=2010|title=Evaluation of "Big Decisions": An Abstinence-Plus Sexuality Curriculum|url=|journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy|volume=36|issue=4|pages=313–326|via=|doi=10.1080/0092623x.2010.488113|pmid=20574887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==

=== Uganda ===
Uganda has been touted as the success story of the ABC strategy, with a significant reduction of HIV/AIDS infection rates and a push towards sexual behavior change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This shift in sexual behavior began in the mid 1980s, when AIDS was a global disease, resulting in the reduction of multiple sexual partners for an individual, and the increase of condom use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parkhurst|first=Justin O.|year=2010|title=Evidence, politics and Uganda's HIV success: Moving forward with ABC and HIV prevention|url=|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=23|issue=2|pages=240–252|doi=10.1002/jid.1667|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  there is debate over whether the ABC strategy was the sole factor that contributed to the decline in HIV/AIDS infection. There has also been debate and discourse over the emphasis of one tenet of ABC sex education over the other. Currently there is the debate over the emphasis of "A" over "C" and vis versa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Uganda's HIV/AIDS and sex education program has a greater focus on the use of condoms in preventing HIV/AIDS, however, religious institutions emphasize abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The success of the ABC strategy in sex education is in part due to the fact that the branches of this strategy are "proximate determinants of HIV infection", also known as ways of reducing or even avoiding the risk of infection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Malawi ===
Like Uganda, there is a push to change the sexual behaviors, however, this message is being emphasized by religious leaders rather than state officials.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trinitapoli|first=Jenny|year=2009|title=Religious teachings and influences on the ABCs of HIV prevention in Malawi|url=|journal=Social Science and Medicine|volume=69|issue=2|pages=199–209|via=|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.04.018|pmid=19447536}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three tenets of ABC are broken down in Malawi into groups. Abstinence is emphasized for individuals who are young and unmarried, who hear messages about AIDS regularly; Be faithful is emphasized with married couples whose religious leader "polices" their sexual behavior; Condom use is a contested area with religious leaders due to the fact that religious openly denounce condom use, however some leaders have privately consulted individuals on condom use, resulting in many members doing so.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, religious leaders do not comment on the risks and issues of AIDS, which can potentially put an entire congregation at risk.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Religious and Ideological Influences ==
Many communities that have adopted the ABC strategy of sex education have used this strategy of sex education in congruence with religious or ideological influences. In Malawi, religious leaders influence and emphasize the use  this strategy&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, in the United States, ideologies influence the use of ABC strategy. In this case, political ideologies influence the use of various sex education programs. For example, conservatism had previously taught young women that sex was about danger, not pleasure, focusing on an abstinence-only education program, reinforcing the foundational conservative ideas  of fear, and that society is fragile and human nature is inherently bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Citizen's Guide to American Ideology|last=Marietta|first=Morgan|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=14–17|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes to School|last=Luker|first=Kristin|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=130|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political ideologies have long been influences in the debate over sex education programs, pushing political agendas.

Globally, the debate of sex education divides liberals and conservatives. In many countries, children do not receive proper sex education, and discourage the act of sex itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Jonathan|year=2014|title=Sex education is a global dividing line between liberals and conservatives|url=|journal=The Washington Post|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==
The usefulness of the ABC approach is highly debated. The three elements are interpreted differently by different actors and critics argue that often abstinence and faithfulness are unduly promoted over condoms and other measures such as education, female empowerment and making available modern antiviral drugs.&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;{{cite journal |pages=590–3 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(05)70219-X |title=HIV/AIDS: Sex, abstinence, and behaviour change |year=2005 |last1=Barnett |first1=Tony |last2=Parkhurst |first2=Justin |journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases |volume=5 |issue=9 |pmid=16122682}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] under President George W Bush has been criticized for seeming to prioritize "A" and "B" over "C" within its funding criteria. "C" activities may only be directed at "high-risk" groups, and not to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Accountability Office, 2006; Cohen J. Tate T. 2005.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, donor funding has always been allocated overwhelmingly to condoms, reflecting clear US and European policy priorities, including under George W Bush.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Criticisms ===
Critics argue that in many countries women are frequently infected by their unfaithful husbands while being faithfully married, and thus women who follow the recommendations of ABC promoters face an increased risk of HIV infection.&lt;ref name=Sinding&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Steven W. |last1=Sinding |title=Does 'CNN' (Condoms, Needles, Negotiation) Work Better than 'ABC' (Abstinence, Being Faithful and Condom Use) in Attacking the AIDS Epidemic? |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |jstor=3649501 |pmid=15888408 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3103805.html |pages=38–40 |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |doi=10.1363/ifpp.31.38.05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Condoms, needles, and negotiation]] is a proposed alternative approach  as is ''SAVE'' (Safer practices, Available medication, Voluntary testing &amp; counseling and Empowerment through education).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anerela.org/prevention-model.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over anerela. Deze website is te koop! |publisher=anerela.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics furthermore allege that the strategy overlooks the epidemic's social, political, and economic causes and "vulnerable populations", e.g. [[sex worker]]s and "those who lack the ability to negotiate safe sex" as well as risk groups such as [[homosexual]]s and [[intravenous drug user]]s. However, most infections in Africa occur outside these vulnerable groups, and ABC  was a US donor policy only for the "generalized" epidemics in Africa. Murphy et al. found that Uganda's ABC approach empowered  women. "Remarkably, in the 2000–2001 Uganda DHS, 91 percent of women said they could refuse sex with their husbands if they knew their husbands had STIs, a somewhat higher percentage than in several other African countries" &lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030379 |title=Was the "ABC" Approach (Abstinence, Being Faithful, Using Condoms) Responsible for Uganda's Decline in HIV? |year=2006 |last1=Murphy |first1=Elaine M. |last2=Greene |first2=Margaret E. |last3=Mihailovic |first3=Alexandra |last4=Olupot-Olupot |first4=Peter |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=e379 |pmid=17002505 |pmc=1564179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics also argue that using the word "abstinence," then teaching about safe sex and contraceptives, can be contradictory.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jonathan |last1=Cohen |first2=Tony |last2=Tate |title=The Less They Know, the Better: Abstinence-Only HIV/AIDS Programs in Uganda |journal=Reproductive Health Matters |jstor=25475267 |pmid=18446994 |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2005/uganda0305/index.htm |pages=174–178 |volume=14 |issue=28 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(06)28249-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the argument of the gendered presentation of ABC success stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Shari L.|last2=Ehrhardt|first2=Anke A.|year=2007|title=Going Beyond "ABC" to Include "GEM": Critical Reflections on Progress in the HIV/AIDS Epidemic|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=97|issue=1|pages=13–18|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.074591|pmid=17138923|via=|pmc=1716252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has indicated that the power roles in which men and women fall in the gender dynamic of relationships, as well as sexual double standards, sexual violence, and harmful cultural practices affect a greater number of women when trying to implement HIV/AIDS prevention through individual decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Critiques of geographic location are also relevant in the success of ABC success. Migration patterns within a population affect both men and women where men who migrate are more likely to contract the infection and bring it back and infect their female partner, whose greatest risk of contracting HIV is from their husbands extramarital sexual encounters, but women are also seen contracting the disease outside of their primary relationship, focusing the ABC strategy on morality and "static individualized behavior".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parikh|first=Shanti A.|year=2007|title=The Political Economy of Marriage and HIV: The ABC Approach, "Safe" Infidelity, and Managing Moral Risk in Uganda|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=97|issue=7|pages=1198–1208|via=|doi=10.2105/ajph.2006.088682|pmid=17538057|pmc=1913085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate in the U.S. ===
How sex education should be taught in public schools in the United States has been a topic for debate since the sexual revolution.  A majority of the debate is focused on whether or not there should be a comprehensive sex education program or an abstinence-only program.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Abstinence-only sex education programs have been proven to be ineffective and there is little evidence showing that abstinence-only, or abstinence-only-until-marriage programs lower [[risky sexual behavior]] in teens&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kelly L.|last2=Lee Smith|first2=Matthew|last3=Rosen|first3=Brittany L.|last4=Wiley|first4=David C.|year=2012|title=Adoption and implementation characteristics for abstinence-plus curriculum|url=|journal=American Journal of Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence to support a parental push for earlier sex education for students, starting in elementary school rather than middle school. Along with the push for earlier sex education, there is the call for age-appropriate sex education. This means that for elementary school students, the sex education they receive will be tailored to their age. A study conducted in 2013 found that parents who pushed for earlier sex education settled on the sex education elementary school students receive will be 89% communication skills, 65% human anatomy/reproductive information, 61% abstinence, 53% HIV/STD infection information, and 52% gender/sexual orientation issues.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barr|first=Elissa M.|last2=Moore|first2=Michelle J.|last3=Johnson|first3=Tammie|last4=Forrest|first4=Jamie|last5=Jordan|first5=Melissa|year=2014|title=New Evidence: Data Documenting Parental Support for Earlier Sexuality Education Authors|url=|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=84|issue=1|pages=10–17|doi=10.1111/josh.12112|via=|pmid=24320147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents in this study also supported a greater emphasis on sex education in middle schools and an increase in the teaching of the same topics from elementary school as well as a greater emphasis on birth control and condom use&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Pope]] [[Benedict XVI]] has criticized some harm reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that "if the soul is lacking, if Africans do not help one another, the scourge [of HIV] cannot be resolved by distributing condoms; quite the contrary, we risk worsening the problem".{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Whilst this position has been widely denounced for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yankee |last1=Doodling |title=The papal position on condoms and HIV |journal=BMJ |pmid=19321547 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19321547 |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1217 |year=2009 |volume=338 |pages=b1217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b1206 |title=Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem |year=2009 |last1=Roehr |first1=B. |journal=BMJ |volume=338 |pages=b1206 |pmid=19321545}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been expert scientific opinion and evidence supporting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Pope May Be Right |first=Edward C. |last=Green |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032702825.html |work=The Washington Post |date=29 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Archbishop Gabriel Charles Palmer-Buckle of Accra has stated that "the Catholic Church [offers] three methods to help solve this problem of AIDS in Africa: "A", abstain; "B", be faithful; "C", chastity, which is in consonance with traditional African values. Those [[Planned Parenthood]] people are only talking about condoms. By the way, they know full well that the condoms devoted to Africa are sub-standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/ghanaian-archbishop-says-church-has-failed-africa |title=Ghanaian archbishop says church has failed Africa |date=October 14, 2009 |first=John L. |last=Allen |work=National Catholic Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|no reliable sources]] that condoms distributed in Africa are inferior to those elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12294480 |year=1999 |title=South Africa plays down faulty condom scare |pages=10–1 |journal=AIDS Weekly Plus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major proponent of the ABC approach, author and member of Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and Aids in 2003-2007, Harvard University's Edward C Green, stated “Advocates of the ABCs often use the term to mean a primary emphasis on abstinence/delay of sexual debut and faithfulness/partner reduction, with condom use being a secondary but necessary strategy for those who do not or cannot practice abstinence or fidelity." Furthermore, Green in his seminal book Rethinking AIDS Prevention (Praeger 2003) argued  that the success in Uganda, where prevalence feel 21% to 6% between 1989-2003 was largely due to the "B" of the ABC approach, fidelity or reduction in multiple partners. This conclusion was validated and expanded to underscore the dangers of concurrent sexual partners by Helen Epstein, in The Invisible Cure &lt;ref&gt;{The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West, and the Fight Against AIDS. Farrar, Straus and Giroux 2007 |&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Urban bicycle 47.JPG|thumb|The [[City bicycle|urban bicycle]], one of the most spread and known vehicle for active mobility]]
'''Active mobility, active travel, active transport''' or '''active transportation''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.activetrans.org/|title=Active Transportation Alliance|author=|date=|website=www.activetrans.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of transport of [[Travel|people]] and sometimes [[Good (economics)|goods]], that only uses the [[physical activity]] of the human being for the locomotion. The most known forms of active mobility are [[walking]] or [[cycling]], though other mobility means such as the [[skateboard]], [[kick scooter]] or [[roller skates]] are also a form of active mobility. In certain latitudes and elevations, practical transportation may also include cross-country skiing and snowshoeing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicalactivitystrategy.ca/pdfs/BEAT/TPlans/City%20Revelstoke_Active%20Transportation%20Plan.pdf|title=Revelstoke Active Transportation Plan, City of Revelstoke, BC|last=|first=|date=2010-01-26|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, perhaps only in the winter season. 

The academical literature evidences that public policies which promote active mobility tend to increase [[Health indicator|health indicators]] by increasing the levels of [[physical fitness]] and reducing the rates of [[obesity]] and diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pucher|first=John|last2=Buehler|first2=Ralph|last3=Bassett|first3=David R.|last4=Dannenberg|first4=Andrew L.|date=1 October 2010|title=Walking and Cycling to Health: A Comparative Analysis of City, State, and International Data|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2009.189324|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=100|issue=10|pages=1986–1992|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2009.189324|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2937005|pmid=20724675}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst also reducing the consumption of [[fossil fuel]]s and consequent particulates, Nitrous Oxide and [[Carbon emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polisnetwork.eu/uploads/Modules/PublicDocuments/polis-paper-health-and-transport_final-3-dec.pdf|title=Polis: Securing the benefits of active travel in Europe|author=|date=|website=polisnetwork.eu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and environment==
Serious [[health]] and environmental problems, especially [[global climate change]] due to fossil fuel usage and the continued increase in obesity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lysander.sourceoecd.org/pdf/factbook2009/302009011e-11-01-04.pdf |title=OECD data showing rates of obesity |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a current political concern. A [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] Health Committee report into Obesity in 2004 recommended promoting and facilitating cycling and walking as key components of an integrated anti-obesity strategy, suggesting "physical activity incorporated into the fabric of everyday life".&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Health Committee, Obesity – Third Report of Session 2003–04 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmhealth/23/23.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Public Health England estimated in 2016 that in the UK, physical inactivity directly contributes to one in six deaths every year. The PHE report notes that including walking and cycling to daily routines is the most effective way to increase physical activity and reduce levels of obesity, as well as prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and several mental illnesses, including depression.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/523460/Working_Together_to_Promote_Active_Travel_A_briefing_for_local_authorities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Studies have shown that the recent global increase in levels of obesity can be attributed to the decrease in physical activity by [[children]] and adults.  This is also as a result of an increase in more [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]] forms of leisure (TV, video games) and to low levels of walking and cycling. Correlational studies have shown that across socio-economic groupings in the UK [[caloric]] intake does not vary significantly, whereas activity levels and [[body mass index|BMI]] do, and are closely correlated to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, A. M et al. BMJ 1995;311:437–439&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Centers for Disease Control]] has also recommended increasing access to active transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyplaces/transportation/promote_strategy.htm|title=CDC – Healthy Places – Transportation HIA Toolkit – Strategies: Promote Active Transportation|author=|date=9 June 2017|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses from the public administrations==
In response to the high level of sedentarian life-style and automobile usage, which have negative environmental and health effects, a recent movement has emerged led by [[public health]] and environmental campaigners to advocate for stronger policies and practices that promote active travel, and make cycling and walking safer and more attractive. The intention being that these modes could, in many instances, replace car usage for everyday journeys to school, shops, public services, etc. To facilitate this would require local planning and highway authorities to invest in ensuring safe routes are available to these destinations (danger from other road traffic is frequently cited as the primary reason for not cycling). In many areas, the current focus of development for cycling infrastructure is on isolated leisure trails, resulting in highly fragmented [[cycle route]]s and pavements/sidewalks, which do not link effectively to everyday destinations. Governments can take the initiative to establish active transportation programs and plans, such as California's Active Transportation Program (ATP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/LocalPrograms/atp/index.html|title=Active Transportation Program (ATP)|website=www.dot.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portland, Oregon's Regional Active Transportation Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oregonmetro.gov/regional-active-transportation-plan|title=Regional Active Transportation Plan|date=2014-07-25|work=Metro|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fort Worth, Texas ATP&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortworthtexas.gov/atp/|title=Active Transportation Plan|website=City of Fort Worth, Texas|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and San Diego County ATP,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/pds/advance/ActiveTransportationPlan.html|title=Active Transportation Plan|website=www.sandiegocounty.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Active and Sustainable School Transportation (ASST) planning and implementation, such as in Hamilton, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/elementary/get-involved/active-and-sustainable-school-transportation-asst/|title=Active and Sustainable School Transportation (ASST) {{!}} Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board|last=Board|first=Hamilton-Wentworth District School|website=www.hwdsb.on.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In 2012 Polis, a network of European cities and regions, published a position paper that calls upon European institutions and other European actors to take action, to ensure that the promotion of health benefits of active travel are maximised in all relevant European policies and programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polisnetwork.eu/publicnews/194/45/Polis-Released-Position-Paper-on-Active-Travel-and-Health/|title=Polis Network – News|date=|publisher=Polisnetwork.eu|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommendation are based on references in European policy documents to improving health through active travel which should form the basis of shared objectives, policies, work programmes and investment to increase levels of walking and cycling.

Specific recommendations include:

* Clearly identifying a leader for the work on active travel and health in the [[European Commission]].
* Consulting stakeholders from the health, environment and transport sectors to explore the opportunity of European initiatives.
* Internalisation of [[external costs]] in transport aimed at ensuring that all health costs are taken into account, including physical inactivity.
* Taking the economic dimension of active [[mobilities|mobility]], and the long-term savings it can generate in [[healthcare costs]] and environmental benefits, systematically into consideration when appraising transport and urban development plans and policies.
* Institutions at the European level may wish to consider funding activities to secure the benefits of active travel in Europe.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, over 50% of car journeys are under 5&amp;nbsp;km, which in theory, could be replaced by active mobility means.&lt;ref&gt;Source: CTC&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, the UK Association of Directors of Public Health, with [[Sustrans]], [[Cyclists' Touring Club|CTC]], [[Ramblers|The Ramblers]] and other agencies, launched a Call to Action on Active Travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adsph.org/downloads/policies/Take_action_on_active_travel_2009.pdf |title=Take Action on Active Travel |publisher=Adsph.org |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222222226/http://www.adsph.org/downloads/policies/Take_action_on_active_travel_2009.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sets out a number of clear goals for local planning and highway authorities.  If achieved, these goals could mark an effective response to the steadily increasing problem of obesity, and also help reduce carbon emissions.  However, the process for monitoring progress towards these goals (beyond anecdotal good-news stories) and holding councils to account for their performance, is weak, and threatens to undermine progress towards the goals:

* A 20&amp;nbsp;mph (32&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed limit to be made the norm in residential areas
* A coherent high quality network of cycle routes that link everyday destinations
* Improved driver training and better-enforced [[traffic laws]]
* Ambitious official targets to be set for increases in walking and cycling

The ''[[Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013]]'' became law in Wales in 2013. The Act requires local authorities to continuously improve facilities and routes for pedestrians and cyclists and to prepare maps identifying current and potential future routes for their use. It also requires new road schemes (including road improvement) to consider the needs of pedestrians and cyclists at design stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senedd.assembly.wales/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=5750|title=Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013  – National Assembly for Wales|work=assembly.wales|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agricultural safety and health''' is an aspect of [[occupational safety and health]] in the agricultural workplace. It specifically addresses the health and safety of farmers, farm workers, and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/|title=CDC - Agricultural Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to perceived belief and notions of work in the agricultural landscape, agriculture is one of the most dangerous industries in the US, with a variety of factors causing injuries and death in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Reed |first1=Deborah B. |last2=Wachs |first2=Joy E. |date=September 2004 |title=The Risky Business of Production Agriculture |doi=10.1177/216507990405200909 |journal=AAOHN Journal |volume=52 |pages=401–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the injuries, long-term or short, prevalent in the occupation are [[hearing loss]], [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s, respiratory diseases, poisoning from [[pesticides]] and chemicals, reproductive issues, and many other ailments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Arthur L.|last2=McKnight|first2=Robert|last3=Kirkhorn|first3=Steven R.|last4=Gunderson|first4=Paul|date=April 2004 |title=Issues of Agricultural Safety and Health |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123007 |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=25|issue=1|pages=225–245|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123007|issn=0163-7525}}&lt;/ref&gt; These injuries are caused mainly by loud noises from machinery, stress from transporting heavy objects, gases and fumes like methane and from chemicals, and other various causes, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Details ==
According to a 2011 study by the [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]], a major cause of injury and deaths in the workplace comes from farm machinery/vehicles, specifically tractor overturns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/agriculturaloperations/vehiclehazards.html|title=Agricultural Operations: Vehicle Hazards|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] has stressed that while the industry produces a necessary product needed by everyone, the industry is diminishing in prevalence and only recently, has been viewed as an occupation needed of further knowledge and development of safety measures and standards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following a 1988 national conference held at [[Ohio State University]] and University of Ohio, the report ''Agriculture at risk'' was published in the ''Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health''.&lt;ref&gt;Donham, K.J., and J. F. Storm. 1988. Agriculture at risk: A report to the nation. Journal of Agricultural Safety and Health 8(1):9-35.&lt;/ref&gt; This report was funded by NIOSH, who assisted with the initiation of research and implementation regarding agricultural health issues, illnesses, and safety measures in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The demographics behind agricultural work has been changing throughout the years, with the rise of more private, family owned farm industries, as well as the increasing prevalence of young farm workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Young farm workers are at a greater risk than older or adult farm workers of injury, but this issue is not addressed to the full extent due to nonexistence in the statistics of the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|Bureau of Labor]], which only regards those of age 16 and older.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Increase of young farm workers could be attributed to the rising trend of "return to farming". Not only young workers, but women farm workers are increasing at a steady rate as the lead operators of the farm industries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the exact timeline of the history behind agricultural occupational safety and health is not set, there are major dates, through the years, that led the way of increasing the importance of agricultural safety measures. The initial steps in enacting laws to improve agricultural safety measures occurred in 1878 in the Threshing Machines Act.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofosh.org.uk/timeline.html|title=Timeline - History of Occupational Safety and Health|website=www.historyofosh.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in the timeline, the Agriculture Poisonous Substances Act and Agriculture Safety, Health, and Welfare Provisions Act were enacted in 1952 and 1956, respectively, to address regulations of the use of chemicals as well as stressing safety and sanitation measures, especially for young children farm workers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most recent event has occurred in 2008 in which the [[Pesticides Safety Directorate|Pesticide Safety Directorate (PSD)]] is now under the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), with the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Areas (DEFRA) being the previous department to oversee the [[Pesticides Safety Directorate|PSD]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Risk ==
The agriculture industry is one of the most dangerous occupations and has led to thousands of deaths due to work-related injuries in the US. In 2011 the fatality rate for farmworkers was 7 times higher than that of all the workers in the private industry, a difference of 24.9 deaths for every 100,000 people as opposed to 3.5 deaths for every 100,000 people in the private industry.&lt;ref name="osha"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/agriculturaloperations/|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Agricultural Operations|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) estimated that 374 farmers and farmworkers died due to a work-related injury in 2012, tractor overturns being the number one cause death. An average of 113 youth between the ages of 16–19 years die annually from agriculture related injuries (1995-2002). About 167 farmworkers each day are affected by a lost-work-time injury in which 5% of them suffer from permanent damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/|title=CDC - Agricultural Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-fatal injuries that farmworkers are at high risk for include work-related lung problems, hearing loss due to noise, skin diseases, various cancers due to exposure to certain chemicals as well as prolonged exposure to the sun.&lt;ref name="osha" /&gt;

== Laws and regulations ==
Unlike other industries that impose labor laws and occupational safety and health regulations in the workplace, agriculture deals with diverse production, large labor force and an array of environmental conditions that makes it difficult to address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agsafety.osu.edu/|title=Agricultural Safety &amp; Health Program|website=agsafety.osu.edu|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the first law towards agriculture safety started in 1878 with the Threshing Machines Act 1878. As the industry mechanized, the Chaff-Cuttings Machine (Accidents) Act 1897 provided slightly more statutory protection. In 1947, the Health, Welfare, and Safety in Non-Industrial Employment Hours of Employment of Juveniles: Report by a Committee of Enquiry was presented to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament,]] leading to two acts. These two acts, the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952, and the Agriculture (Safety, Health, and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956. The Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952, which protected employees against risks of poisoning, while the Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956 gave workers and children health protection and safeguards. However, it was repealed and modified in 1975 by the Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956 (Repeals and Modifications) Regulations 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.historyofosh.org.uk/timeline.html|title = Timeline - History of Occupational Safety and Health|website = www.historyofosh.org.uk/|access-date = 2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
[[File:Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration logo.png|thumb|The Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration logo.]]
In the [[United States of America]], the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) overviews agricultural safety. as with all OSHA standards, it is covered by Section 5(a)(1) and Section 5(a)(2), which requires employers to "furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees" and to comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this act." Agriculture Safety is covered by the Agriculture (29 CFR 1928), which mostly covers farm equipment and operation, and the General Industry (29 CFR 1910) standards, which defines workplace safety for all industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owastand.display_standard_group?p_toc_level=1&amp;p_part_number=1928|title = Occup. Safety and Health Standards for Agriculture &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website = www.osha.gov|access-date = 2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owastand.display_standard_group?p_toc_level=1&amp;p_part_number=1910|title = Occupational Safety and Health Standards &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website = www.osha.gov|access-date = 2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, there are 28 OSHA-approved State Plans that have standards that are "at least as effective as OSHA's and may have different or more stringent requirements".&lt;ref name="oshastandards"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/agriculturaloperations/standards.html|title = Safety and Health Topics &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Agricultural Operations - Standards|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|access-date = 2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illnesses and injuries from agricultural work ==
Illnesses and injuries regarding agriculture can vary from one farm to another, according to which industry or sector the farm specializes in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This becomes more apparent as the environment of each farm is different according to these specialties, which in turn poses different areas of risk factors leading to injuries and ailments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In all though, there are similarities in the risk factors and illnesses that agricultural workers face on a day to day basis as in injuries from machinery, large animals, pesticides, respiratory illness-causing factors, musculoskeletal disorders, [[hearing loss]], reproductive issues regarding women, and many more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most common illnesses seem to be [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s, [[pesticide poisoning]], and [[Respiratory disease|respiratory diseases.]]

=== Musculoskeletal disorders ===
[[Musculoskeletal disorder]]s can arise from a number of factors, but the main causes seem to be from livestock and large machinery/equipment. Machinery are usually devoid of safety measures and pose a greater threat, since agricultural workers fix and operate these machines themselves for utilization in the fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These machines may also be run while repairs are under way, causing even more instances of potential injuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bending, twisting, and stretching motions that are apparent when operating these equipment causes much back and neck strain, leading to more exacerbated conditions over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is in regards to not only agricultural workers operating machinery, but also workers in the fields, who experience pain and strains in the wrists, back, hips, and knees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Livestock can also pose a threat to the [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal systems]] of the body due to their large weight and varied behavior, possibly leading to kicking and unintentional blows by the animal to the agricultural worker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; No matter the cause, it is apparent that [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s are common in the agricultural industry and need to be addressed to treat the ailment as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a study regarding agricultural work safety climate of  approximately 300 [[North Carolina]] migrant farmworkers, 40% had musculoskeletal ailments and many reported numerous days working while ill.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arcury|first=Thomas A.|last2=O’Hara|first2=Heather|last3=Grzywacz|first3=Joseph G.|last4=Isom|first4=Scott|last5=Chen|first5=Haiying|last6=Quandt|first6=Sara A.|date=May 2012|title=Work Safety Climate, Musculoskeletal Discomfort, Working While Injured, and Depression Among Migrant Farmworkers in North Carolina|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=S2|pages=S272–S278|doi=10.2105/ajph.2011.300597|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3358567|pmid=22401520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many underestimated the safety measures they were able to obtain and thought that risks were inevitable due to the risks involved in agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Musculoskeletal disorders are categorized into acute or first time injuries and chronic long-term ailments according to many acute injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis and Kotowski|first=Kermit G. and Susan E.|date=2007|title=Understanding the Ergonomic Risk for Musculoskeletal Disorders in the United States Agricultural Sector|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajim.20479/epdf|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=50|pages=501–511|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/ajim.20479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pesticide poisoning ===
[[File:Pesticides application 01.jpg|thumb|[[Pesticide]] application for chemical control of nematodes in a sunflower planted field. [[Karaisalı|Karaisalı, Adana - Turkey.]]]]
Chemical and pesticide use causes many health ailments as in chemical or pesticide poisoning and reproductive issues in women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some common chemicals used in agriculture are [[bipyridyl]]s, [[Organophosphate|organophosphates,]] and [[carbamate]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Exposure to pesticides can occur through not just the process of making pesticides, but also in other agricultural tasks like harvesting crop or irrigating fields.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calvert|first=Geoffrey M., et. al|date=2008|title=Acute Pesticide Poisoning Among Agricultural Workers in the United States|doi=10.1002/ajim.20623|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=51|pages=883–898|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the problem arises in the lack of more strict safety measures as well as utilization of personal protective equipment, but the use of pesticides requires care in itself of set safety measures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The United States' use of pesticides resides heavily in agriculture, with 75% being used in this industry.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In a study by the [[California Department of Pesticide Regulation]] and the [[SENSOR-Pesticides|SENSOR- Pesticides]] program, regarding pesticide poisoning incidence rates out of 3,271 cases, 402 individuals had medium severity illnesses from pesticide exposure with high severity cases being rare and lower severity being more common.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; From this study, the pesticides that were deemed to cause most cases of diseases were [[cholinesterase]], [[Pyrethroid|pyrethroids,]] [[inorganic compound]]s, and [[dithiocarbamate]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Insecticide|Insecticides,]] specifically cholinesterase inhibitors (N-methyl carbamates and [[organophosphate]]s) cause a majority of the illnesses in 54% of the individuals in the case.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some of the more common symptoms seen in pesticide poisoning were nervous system impairments, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, respiratory impairments, skin impairments, inflammations, and many more.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Respiratory diseases ===
Recently, agricultural respiratory diseases have been rising from development of animal production facilities causing toxic fumes to permeate the area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Much of the irritants involved in causing these diseases are [[ammonia]], [[Organic dust toxic syndrome|organic dust,]] [[hydrogen sulfide]], bacterial microorganisms, mold, and various [[Hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Youth in agricultural operations ==
Incidents that occur involving farm machinery are a risk to children under the age of 13 and those who are employed in any way must be properly trained by their employer in order to use the machinery. According to the law, children under 13 cannot drive any farm machinery, and children under 16 cannot operate machinery that is equipped with mechanisms that could seriously injure them.&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety Executive, United Kingdom, “Children and Public Safety.” Children and Public Safety. http://www.hse.gov.uk/agriculture/topics/children.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if there is an adult present within the machine, children under 13 cannot sit within the cab of an agricultural vehicle. As for children or adults who are not there for labor, use of a trailer may be allowed under the condition that the trailer is in good condition, has good seating, is fitted with guard railing, and supervision is supplied at all times.

Children are also prohibited from being within the vicinity of a potentially dangerous animal. Without competent supervision, animals can exhibit behaviors that may severely injure a child in the area. Children are exposed to potential danger in the farm, so areas that chemicals are stored, reservoirs, slurry pits, grain bins, and that contain farm machinery, must be properly enclosed with fencing or locked for precaution.

Nonfatal injuries in agriculture that occur may permanently disable, injure, or kill youths over 13 on the farm in the United States. An estimation of $1 billion annually has been spent on nonfatal injuries to youths in agriculture. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health]] has created the Childhood Agricultural Injury Prevention Initiative for young workers and their employers to reduce the amount of injures on the job. 33,000 children have farm-related injuries each year in the United States, and 113 who are less than 20 years of age have died from farm-related injuries between 1995 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Youth in Agriculture |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United States Department of Labor |url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/agriculturaloperations/youngworkers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
In 1991, the Surgeon General's Conference in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], was held to bring awareness to the risks that children face in production agriculture. A session titled "Intervention: Safe Behaviors Among Adults and Children," emphasized the need for children's injury prevention. This conference was followed by the Childhood Agricultural Injury Prevention symposium in [[Marshfield, Wisconsin]], that sought to propose policies, further education on agricultural injuries among children, and demonstrate relevant research on the topic. As a result of the symposium, the National Committee for Childhood Agricultural Injury Prevention (NCCAIP) was formed. From this, the [[National Action Plan for Children|National Action Plan]] was finalized over 16 months, and it addressed agricultural injuries that occurred to children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Childhood Agricultural Injury Prevention Initiative |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=10 April 2017 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/childag/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural risks concerning livestock ==
=== Large livestock ===
Handling livestock involves a risk of injury.  Large livestock, especially, have the ability to crush the handler, and without proper training and competent workers, unrestrained cattle can seriously injure workers, visitors, and even vets. Proper handling facilities that are kept in working order are suggested when dealing with larger livestock.&lt;ref name="hse.gov.uk"&gt;Health and Safety Executive, United Kingdom, “Agriculture: livestock.” Agriculture: livestock. http://www.hse.gov.uk/agriculture/topics/livestock.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A suitable race and crush may be helpful, but makeshift equipment has more hazards and risk of injury. When keeping bulls, most accidents occur because of the lack of precaution when handling the bull. Because bulls are temperamental, training will be helpful when exposing the bull to others. Bulls who are willing to be trained can be taught to associate people will their needs, such as feeding, exercise, and grooming. Training will then make a less hazardous workplace if the bull is docile. At 10 months, it is suggested to ring bulls, and the ring must be inspected regularly.&lt;ref name="hse.gov.uk"/&gt; Competent workers and proper handling will avoid fatal injuries.

=== Zoonosis ===
[[File:Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), H&amp;E.jpg|thumb|Magnified 100X, and stained with H&amp;E (hematoxylin and eosin) staining technique, this light photomicrograph of brain tissue reveals the presence of prominent spongiotic changes in the cortex, and loss of neurons in a case of [[Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).]]]]
Exposure to animal with diseases are a risk for agricultural workers. [[Zoonosis]] are diseases that are transmitted from infected animals to humans. Most zoonotic diseases are caused by organisms such as parasites, [[bacteria]], [[prion]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protozoa]], and [[virus]]es, which reside within the animal but can be pathogens to humans. Direct or indirect transmission from feces or bodily fluids can result in infection, and consuming animal products that are contaminated can also become a cause of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Animal-Acquired Infections &amp; Related Hazards |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United States Department of Labor |url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/topics/agriculturaloperations/hazards_controls.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their close contact with animals, farmers, veterinarians, ranchers, and other agricultural workers are more at risk for contracting zoonotic diseases.

=== Examples of zoonotic diseases ===
*[[Anthrax]]
*[[Avian influenza]]
*[[Brucellosis]]
*[[Cryptosporidiosis]]
*[[Giardiasis]]
*[[Leptospirosis]]
*[[Mycobacterium bovis]]
*[[Orthohantavirus]]

An '''agroecosystem''' is the basic unit of study in [[agroecology]], and is somewhat arbitrarily defined as a spatially and functionally coherent unit of agricultural activity, and includes the living and nonliving components involved in that unit as well as their interactions.
&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;Agro-ecosystem Health Project. 1996. Agroecosystem health. University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---
An [[ecosystem]] is a ”functional system of complementary relations between living organisms and their environment, delimited by arbitrarily chosen boundaries, which in space and time appear to maintain a steady yet dynamic [[equilibrium]]."
&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt; Gliessman, Stephen. R Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture. Ann Arbor: Sleeping Bear Press, 1998. &lt;/ref&gt; 
---&gt;

An agroecosystem can be viewed as a subset of a conventional [[ecosystem]]. As the name implies, at the core of an agroecosystem lies the human activity of [[agriculture]]. However, an agroecosystem is not restricted to the immediate site of agricultural activity (e.g. the [[farm]]), but rather includes the region that is impacted by this activity, usually by changes to the complexity of [[Community (ecology)|species assemblages]] and [[Food chain|energy flows]], as well as to the [[Nutrient cycle|net nutrient balance]]. Traditionally an agroecosystem, particularly one managed [[Intensive farming|intensively]], is characterized as having a simpler species composition and simpler energy and nutrient flows than "natural" ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;Elske van de Fliert and Ann R.

==The future for farming?==
Some major organizations are hailing farming within agro ecosystems as the way forward for mainstream [[agriculture]]. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of [[erosion]] and reduced [[soil fertility]]. According to a report by the [[International Water Management Institute]] and the [[United Nations Environment Programme]],&lt;ref&gt;Boelee, E. (Ed) [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/ Ecosystems for water and food security], 2011, [[IWMI]], [[UNEP]]&lt;/ref&gt; there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests, as well addressing inequities that sometimes result when such measures are adopted, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for
more productive farmland, or the preservation of a [[wetland]] system that limits fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D., [http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf Opinion: The Water Deficit], ''The Scientist'', 23 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==A long tradition==
[[Forest gardening|Forest gardens]] are probably the world's oldest and most resilient agroecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of a family improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the family's garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20forest-garden%20farms%20of%20Kandy%2C%20Sri%20Lanka.&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major efforts of disciplines such as [[agroecology]] is to promote management styles that blur the distinction between agroecosystems and "natural" ecosystems, both by decreasing the impact of agriculture (increasing the biological and trophic complexity of the agricultural system as well as decreasing the nutrient inputs/outflow) and by increasing awareness that "downstream" effects extend agroecosystems beyond the boundaries of the farm (e.g. the [[Corn_belt#Corn_Belt|Corn Belt]] agroecosystem includes the [[Hypoxic_zone#Gulf_of_Mexico|hypoxic zone]] in the Gulf of Mexico). In the first case, [[polyculture]] or [[Buffer Strips|buffer strips]] for wildlife habitat can restore some complexity to a cropping system, while [[organic farming]] can reduce nutrient inputs. Efforts of the second type are most common at the [[Drainage basin|watershed]] scale. An example is the [[Conservation district|National Association of Conservation Districts']] [[Lake Mendota]] Watershed Project, which seeks to reduce runoff from the agricultural lands feeding into the lake with the aim of reducing [[algal blooms]].

&lt;!---
Agroecosystems may be distinguished from other ecosystems through the specific manner in which humans manipulate these ecosystems; agroecosystems are ecosystems manipulated by humans for the production of [[food]], [[fiber]], and [[fuel]]. ---&gt;

'''Alan Walter Whiteside''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born in Nairobi, [[Kenya]], on 18 March 1956) is a [[South African]] academic, researcher and professor at the [[Balsillie School of International Affairs]] and professor emeritus at the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]]. He is well known for his innovative work in the field of the social impacts of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]].

==Education==
Whiteside obtained a bachelor's degree in 1978, and an MA (Development Economics) in 1980, from the School of Development Studies at the [[University of East Anglia]].  He then obtained a D.Econ. from the University of Natal (now University of KwaZulu-Natal) in 2003.  Whiteside joined the university as a research fellow in 1983, and in 1998 founded the Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research Division&lt;ref name="heard.org.za"&gt;http://www.heard.org.za&lt;/ref&gt; (HEARD). He held a chair at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, where he was executive director of HEARD. Currently, Whiteside has a position at the Balsillie School of International Affairs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balsillieschool.ca/|title=Balsillie School of International Affairs|website=www.balsillieschool.ca|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wilfrid Laurier University]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=12912{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; School of International Policy and Governance. He holds a [[Center for International Governance Innovation]] Chair in Global Health Policy.   

==Career==

Whiteside started his career as a freelance journalist and teacher in Mbabane, Swaziland, before joining the Botswana Ministry of Finance and Development Planning as an [[Overseas Development Institute]] Fellow and a planning officer/economist in 1980.
He was a research fellow,  senior research fellow and associate professor at the Economic Research Unit at the University of Natal, from 1983 to 1997. Whiteside was an associate and director for Capricorn Africa Economic Associates, in Mbabane, Swaziland, between 1988 and 1998.
In 1998 he founded the Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research Division&lt;ref name="heard.org.za"/&gt; (HEARD) and he was subsequently promoted to professor. He was a senior research fellow at the [[Department for International Development]](DFID) from 2009 to 2012.

In 2012 he was appointed CIGI Chair in Global Health at the Balsillie School of International Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wlu.ca/news_detail.php?grp_id=0&amp;nws_id=10446&lt;/ref&gt;

Whiteside has written many peer-reviewed articles, and has authored several books and numerous papers relating to HIV and AIDS.  Of particular importance was his 2003 paper, (with fellow academic [[Alex de Waal]]), ‘New variant famine: AIDS and the food crisis in southern Africa’, in The Lancet. Among his books are the popular ‘AIDS the Challenge for South Africa’  (with [[Clem Sunter]], 2000), and influential academic volumes such as ‘HIV/AIDS: A Very Short Introduction’, ([[Oxford University Press]], 2008), and 'AIDS in the Twenty-First Century: Disease and Globalization' (with Tony Barnett,  2006).
Whiteside’s work has encompassed lecturing, mentorship and training.  He developed the successful ‘Planning for HIV/AIDS’ training workshop for the Overseas Development Group at the University of East Anglia.  He continues to mentor and supervise many students, academics and researchers in the field.  He has worked with many international donors philanthropies and the corporate sector.

Whiteside was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to science and strategic interventions to curb HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61092|supp=y|page=N27|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/391415/Diplomatic_and_Overseas_NY15_Honours_List.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 31, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231045943/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/391415/Diplomatic_and_Overseas_NY15_Honours_List.pdf |archivedate=December 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public and professional service==

== Cold temperature ==
Many believe that cold temperature can cause and therefore prevention of exposure to cold temperature can prevent the common cold.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Ec2002/&gt; --&gt; Evidence does not support this association.&lt;ref name=Ec2002&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eccles|first=R.|date=2002-09-01|title=Acute cooling of the body surface and the common cold|journal=Rhinology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=109–114|issn=0300-0729|pmid=12357708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vitamin C ==
{{main|Vitamin C and the common cold}}

Vitamin C was identified in the early part of the previous century and there was much interest in its possible effects on various infections including the common cold.&lt;ref name="Hemila2006"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Hemilä |first=Harri |title=Do vitamins C and E affect respiratory infections? |date=January 2006 |publisher=University of Helsinki |isbn=978-952-10-2837-3 |hdl=10138/20335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hemila2009"&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-3-7643-9912-2_13|chapter = Vitamins and minerals|title = Commond Cold| pages=275–307|year = 2009|last1 = Hemilä|first1 = Harri| isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hemila2013&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23440782 | pmc=1160577 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4 | issue=1 | title=Vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold | year=2013 | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | page=CD000980 | last1 = Hemilä | first1 = H | last2 = Chalker | first2 = E}} Refs to the review: http://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hemila/CC&lt;/ref&gt; A few controlled trials on the effect of vitamin C on the common cold were carried out already in the 1940s,&lt;ref name=Hemila2013 /&gt; but the topic became particularly popular after 1970, when [[Linus Pauling]], a double Nobel laureate, wrote a best-selling book ''[[Vitamin C and the Common Cold (book)|Vitamin C and the Common Cold]]''.&lt;ref name="Hemila2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hemila1997&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemilä | first1 = H | year = 1997 | title = Vitamin C supplementation and the common cold - was Linus Pauling right or wrong? | journal = Int J Vitam Nutr Res | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 329–335 | hdl = 10250/7980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauling's book led to great interest in the topic among lay people, but also among academic circles. After Pauling's book, a number of controlled trials were carried out. However, the interest disappeared after the middle of 1970s apparently because of the publication of two reviews and one primary study, which all concluded that vitamin C does not influence the common cold. However, the three papers were later shown to be erroneous.&lt;ref name="Hemila2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hemila2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hemila2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hemila1997 /&gt;

According to the Cochrane review on vitamin C and the common cold, 1 g/day or more of vitamin C does not influence common cold incidence in the general community.&lt;ref name=Hemila2013 /&gt; However, in five randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials with participants who were under heavy short-term physical stress (three of the trials were with marathon runners), vitamin C halved the incidence of colds.&lt;ref name=Hemila2013 /&gt; In the dose of 1 g/day or more, vitamin C shortened the duration of colds in adults by 8% and in children by 18%.&lt;ref name=Hemila2013 /&gt; Vitamin C also decreased the severity of colds.

==Echinacea==
[[Image:EchinaceaPurpureaMaxima1a.UME.JPG|thumb|[[Echinacea]] flower]]

A [[systematic review]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]], last updated in 2014, examines twenty-four [[randomized controlled trial]]s studying various echinacea preparations for prevention and treatment of the common cold. Echinacea showed no benefit over [[placebo]] for prevention.&lt;ref name=Karsch2014 /&gt; Evidence for treatment was inconsistent. Reported side effects were rare.&lt;ref name="Karsch2014" /&gt;

2007 [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] conclude that there is some evidence that echinacea may reduce either the duration or severity of the common cold, but results are not consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=SA|author2=Sander, S|author3=White, CM|author4=Rinaldi, M|author5=Coleman, CI|title=Evaluation of echinacea for the prevention and treatment of the common cold: a meta-analysis.|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|date=July 2007|volume=7|issue=7|pages=473–80|pmid=17597571|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(07)70160-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21544">'''Amblyaudia''' (amblyos- blunt; audia-hearing) is a term coined by Dr. Deborah Moncrieff from the University of Pittsburgh to characterize a specific pattern of performance from dichotic listening tests.  Dichotic listening tests are widely used to assess individuals for binaural integration, a type of auditory processing skill. During the tests, individuals are asked to identify different words presented simultaneously to the two ears. Normal listeners can identify the words fairly well and show a small difference between the two ears with one ear slightly dominant over the other.  For the majority of listeners, this small difference is referred to as a "right-ear advantage" because their right ear performs slightly better than their left ear.  But some normal individuals produce a "left-ear advantage" during dichotic tests and others perform at equal levels in the two ears.  Amblyaudia is diagnosed when the scores from the two ears are significantly different with the individual's dominant ear score much higher than the score in the non-dominant ear &lt;ref&gt;Moncrieff, Keith, Abramson, &amp; Swann (2016) Diagnosis of amblyaudia in children referred for auditory processing assessment. International journal of audiology, 55(6), 333-345.&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers interested in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of amblyaudia consider it to be a [[brain]] based [[hearing]] disorder that may be inherited or that may result from auditory deprivation during critical periods of brain development.&lt;ref name="Whitton 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitton JP, Polley DB |title=Evaluating the perceptual and pathophysiological consequences of auditory deprivation in early postnatal life: a comparison of basic and clinical studies |journal=J.

Even in quiet environments, individuals with amblyaudia may fail to understand what they are hearing, especially if the information is new or complicated.  Amblyaudia can be conceptualized as the auditory analog of the better known central [[visual]] disorder [[amblyopia]]. The term “lazy ear” has been used to describe amblyaudia although it is currently not known whether it stems from deficits in the auditory periphery (middle ear or cochlea) or from other parts of the [[auditory system]] in the brain, or both.  A characteristic of amblyaudia is suppression of activity in the non-dominant auditory pathway by activity in the dominant pathway which may be genetically determined&lt;ref name="Morell 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morell RJ, Brewer CC, Ge D |title=A twin study of auditory processing indicates that dichotic listening ability is a strongly heritable trait |journal=Hum.

A significant deficit in a child's ability to use and comprehend expressive language may be seen in children who lacked auditory stimulation throughout the critical periods of auditory system development. A child suffering from amblyaudia may have trouble in appropriate vocabulary comprehension and production and the use of past, present and future tenses.

==Risk Factors==
Families report the presence of amblyaudia in several individuals, suggesting that it may be genetic in nature.  It is possible that abnormal auditory input during the first two years of life may increase a child’s risk for amblyaudia, although the precise relationship between deprivation timing and development of amblyaudia is still unclear. Recurrent ear infections ([[otitis media]]) are the leading cause of temporary auditory deprivation in young children.&lt;ref name="Pennie 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Pennie RA |title=Prospective study of antibiotic prescribing for children |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=44 |issue= |pages=1850–6 |date=September 1998 |pmid=9789665 |pmc=2277846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teele 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teele DW, Klein JO, Rosner B |title=Epidemiology of otitis media during the first seven years of life in children in greater Boston: a prospective, cohort study |journal=J.

Aural atresia (a closed external auditory canal) also causes temporary auditory deprivation in young children. Hearing can be restored to children with ear infections and aural atresia through surgical intervention (although ear infections will also resolve spontaneously). Nevertheless, children with histories of auditory deprivation secondary to these diseases can experience amblyaudia for years after their hearing has been restored.&lt;ref name="Hall 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmington 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilmington D, Gray L, Jahrsdoerfer R |title=Binaural processing after corrected congenital unilateral conductive hearing loss |journal=Hear.

==Physiology==
Amblyaudia is a deficit in binaural integration of environmental information entering the auditory system.  It is a disorder related to [[brain]] organization and function rather than what is typically considered a “hearing loss” (damage to the cochlea). It may be genetic or developmentally acquired or both. When animals are temporarily deprived of hearing from an early age, profound changes occur in the brain. Specifically, cell sizes in brainstem nuclei are reduced,&lt;ref name="Webster 1977"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Webster DB, Webster M |title=Neonatal sound deprivation affects brain stem auditory nuclei |journal=Arch Otolaryngol |volume=103 |issue=7 |pages=392–6 |date=July 1977 |pmid=880104 |doi=10.1001/archotol.1977.00780240050006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webster 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Webster DB, Webster M |title=Effects of neonatal conductive hearing loss on brain stem auditory nuclei |journal=Ann.

This last point is particularly important for listening tasks that require inputs from two ears to perform well. There are multiple auditory functions that rely on the computation of well calibrated inputs from the two ears. Chief among these is the ability to localize [[sound sources]] and separate what we want to hear from a background of noise. In the brainstem, the [[auditory system]] compares the timing and levels of sounds between the two ears to encode the location of sound sources (sounds that originate from our right as opposed to left side are louder and arrive earlier in our right ear). This ability to separate sound sources not only helps us locate the [[trajectories]] of moving objects, but also to separate different sound sources in noisy environments.

An electrophysiologic study demonstrated that children with amblyaudia (referred to then as a "left-ear deficit") were less able to process information from their non-dominant ears when competing information is arriving at their dominant ears. The N400-P800 complex&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = ERP evidence of a dichotic left-ear deficit in some dyslexic children|last = Moncrieff|first = DW|date = Jul 2004|journal = J Am Acad Audiol|doi = 10.3766/jaaa.15.7.6|pmid = 15484601|access-date =|volume=15|pages=518–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed a strong and highly correlated response from the dominant and non-dominant ears among normal children while the response from children with amblyaudia was uncorrelated and indicated an inability to separate information arriving at the non-dominant ear from the information arriving at the dominant ear.  The same children also produced weaker fMRI responses from their non-dominant left ears&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Hemodynamic differences in children with dichotic listening deficits: preliminary results from an fMRI study during a cued listening task.|last = Moncrieff|first = D|date = Jan 2008|journal = J Am Acad Audiol|doi = 10.3766/jaaa.19.1.4|pmid = 18637408|access-date =|volume=19|pages=33–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; when processing dichotic material in the scanner.

==Clinical Diagnosis==
A clinical diagnosis of amblyaudia is made following [[dichotic listening test]]ing as part of an auditory processing evaluation. Clinicians are advised to use newly developed dichotic listening tests that provide normative cut-off scores for the listener's dominant and non-dominant ears. These are the Randomized Dichotic Digits Test &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Recognition of randomly presented one-, two-, and three-pair dichotic digits by children and young adults.|last = Moncrieff|first = DW|date = Jan 2009|journal = J Am Acad Audiol|doi = 10.3766/jaaa.20.1.6|pmid = 19927683|access-date =|volume=20|pages=58–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dichotic Words Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Age- and Gender-Specific Normative Information from Children Assessed with a Dichotic Words Test.|last = Moncrieff|first = D|date = Jul 2015|journal = J Am Acad Audiol|doi = 10.3766/jaaa.14096|pmid = 26218052|access-date =|volume=26|pages=632–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older dichotic listening tests that provide normative information for the right and left ears can be used to supplement these two tests for support of the diagnosis (&lt;ref&gt;Moncrieff, Keith, Abramson, &amp; Swann, 2016. Diagnosis of amblyaudia in children referred for auditory processing assessment. International journal of audiology, 55(6), 333-345.&lt;/ref&gt;). If performance across two or more dichotic listening tests is normal in the dominant ear and significantly below normal in the non-dominant ear, a diagnosis of amblyaudia can be made.&lt;ref name="Moncrieff 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author =Moncrieff DW |title=Dichotic listening in children: age-related changes in direction and magnitude of ear advantage |journal=Brain Cogn |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=316–22 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21530051 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2011.03.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis can also be made if performance in both ears is below normal but performance in the non-dominant ear is significantly poorer, thereby resulting in an abnormally large asymmetry between the two ears. Amblyaudia is emerging as a distinct subtype of [[auditory processing disorder]] (APD).

A number of computer-based auditory training programs exist for children with generalized [[Auditory processing disorder|Auditory Processing Disorders (APD)]]. In the visual system, it has been proven that adults with amblyopia can improve their [[visual acuity]] with targeted brain training programs ([[perceptual learning]]).&lt;ref name="Levi 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levi DM, Li RW |title=Perceptual learning as a potential treatment for amblyopia: a mini-review |journal=Vision Res. |volume=49 |issue=21 |pages=2535–49 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19250947 |pmc=2764839 |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2009.02.010 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A focused perceptual training protocol for children with amblyaudia called Auditory Rehabilitation for Interaural Asymmetry (ARIA) was developed in 2001&lt;ref name="Moncrieff 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moncrieff DW, Wertz D |title=Auditory rehabilitation for interaural asymmetry: preliminary evidence of improved dichotic listening performance following intensive training |journal=Int J Audiol |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=84–97 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18236240 |doi=10.1080/14992020701770835}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been found to improve dichotic listening performance in the non-dominant ear and enhance general listening skills.  ARIA is now available in a number of clinical sites in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

'''Artificial insemination''' ('''AI''') is the deliberate introduction of [[sperm]] into a female's [[cervix]] or [[uterus|uterine cavity]] for the purpose of achieving a [[pregnancy]] through [[in vivo fertilization]] by means other than [[sexual intercourse]]. It is a [[assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatment]] for humans, and is common practice in [[animal breeding]], including [[dairy cattle]] (see [[Frozen bovine semen]]) and [[pig]]s.

Artificial insemination may employ [[assisted reproductive technology]], [[sperm donation]] and [[animal husbandry]] techniques. Artificial insemination techniques available include [[Artificial insemination#Intracervical insemination|intracervical insemination]] and [[Artificial insemination#Intrauterine insemination|intrauterine insemination]]. The beneficiaries of artificial insemination are women who desire to give birth to their own child who may be single, women who are in a [[lesbian]] relationship or women who are in a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationship but with a male partner who is [[male infertility|infertile]] or who has a physical impairment which prevents full intercourse from taking place. Intracervical insemination (ICI) is the easiest and most common insemination technique and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance.&lt;ref name="European Sperm Bank USA"&gt;[http://www.europeanspermbankusa.com/faq/articles/demystifying-iui-ici-ivi-and-ivf European Sperm Bank USA]&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with [[natural insemination]] (i.e., insemination by sexual intercourse), artificial insemination can be more expensive and more invasive, and may require professional assistance.

[[Sperm donation laws by country|Some countries have laws which restrict and regulate who can donate sperm]] and who is able to receive artificial insemination, and the consequences of such insemination. Some women who live in a jurisdiction which does not permit artificial insemination in the circumstance in which she finds herself may [[fertility tourism|travel to another jurisdiction which permits it]].

===History===
The first reported case of artificial insemination by donor occurred in 1884: Dr. [[William H. Pancoast]], a professor in Philadelphia, took sperm from his "best looking" student to inseminate an anesthetized woman. The woman was not informed about the procedure, unlike her infertile husband. The case was reported 25 years later in a medical journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Medical World |date=April 1909 |pages=163–164 |title=Letter to the Editor: Artificial Impregnation |url=http://familyscholars.org/2011/02/17/4579/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724221400/http://familyscholars.org/2011/02/17/4579/ |archivedate=2012-07-24 }} (cited in {{cite journal|author1=Gregoire, A.  |author2=Mayer, R.|year=1964|title=The impregnators|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=16|pages=130–4 | pmid = 14256095|doi=10.1016/s0015-0282(16)35476-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sperm bank|sperm bank]] was developed in Iowa starting in the 1920s in research conducted by University of Iowa medical school researchers Jerome Sherman and Raymond Bunge.&lt;ref&gt;Kara W. Swanson, “The Birth of the Sperm Bank,” ''Annals of Iowa,'' 71 (Summer 2012), 241–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, direct intraperitoneal insemination (DIPI) was occasionally used, where doctors injected sperm into the lower abdomen through a surgical hole or incision, with the intention of letting them find the oocyte at the ovary or after entering the genital tract through the [[ostium of the fallopian tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lauren |last=Cox |title=Oral Sex, a Knife Fight and Then Sperm Still Impregnated Girl.

===General===
The sperm used in artificial insemination may be provided by either the woman's husband or partner (partner sperm) or by a known or anonymous sperm donor (see [[sperm donation]] (donor sperm)).

If the procedure is successful, the woman will conceive and carry a baby to term in the normal manner. A pregnancy resulting from artificial insemination is no different from a pregnancy achieved by sexual intercourse. In all cases, the woman is the biological mother of any child produced by AI, and the male whose sperm is used is the biological father.

There are multiple methods used to obtain the semen necessary for artificial insemination. Some methods require only men, while others require a combination of a male and female. Those that require only men to obtain semen are masturbation or the aspiration of sperm by means of a puncture of the testicle and epididymus. Methods of collecting semen that involve a combination of a male and female include interrupted intercourse, intercourse with a 'collection condom', or the post-coital aspiration of the semen from the vagina.

There are a number of reasons why a woman with a male partner would use artificial insemination to achieve pregnancy. For example, a woman's immune system may be rejecting her partner's sperm as invading molecules.&lt;ref name="The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson |first=Sarah |title=Professor |url=http://www.figo.org/news/female-bodies-reject-certain-sperm |accessdate=2012-12-27 |newspaper=International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics |date=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104131213/http://www.figo.org/news/female-bodies-reject-certain-sperm |archivedate=2012-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who have issues with the cervix – such as cervical scarring, cervical blockage from [[endometriosis]], or thick cervical [[mucus]] – may also benefit from artificial insemination, since the sperm must pass through the cervix to result in fertilization.

In the case of heterosexual couples who are finding it difficult to conceive, before artificial insemination is turned to as the solution, doctors will require an examination of both the male and female involved in order to remove any and all physical hindrances that are preventing them from naturally achieving a pregnancy. The couple is also given a fertility test to determine the motility, number, and viability of the male's sperm and the success of the female's ovulation. From these tests, the doctor may or may not recommend a form of artificial insemination.

===Preparations===
Timing is critical, as the window and opportunity for fertilization is little more than twelve hours from the release of the ovum. To increase the chance of success, the woman's menstrual cycle is closely observed, often using ovulation kits, ultrasounds or blood tests, such as [[basal body temperature]] tests over, noting the color and texture of the vaginal mucus, and the softness of the nose of her cervix. To improve the success rate of AI, drugs to create a [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|stimulated cycle]] may be used, but the use of such drugs also results in an increased chance of a multiple birth.

Sperm can be provided fresh or [[sperm washing|washed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Adams |title=in vitro fertilization technique |location=Monterey CA |year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The washing of sperm increases the chances of fertilization. Pre- and post-concentration of motile sperm is counted. Sperm from a sperm bank will be frozen and quarantined for a period, and the donor will be tested before and after production of the sample to ensure that he does not carry a transmissible disease. For fresh shipping, a [[semen extender]] is used.

If sperm is provided by a private donor, either directly or through a sperm agency, it is usually supplied fresh, not frozen, and it will not be quarantined. Donor sperm provided in this way may be given directly to the recipient woman or her partner, or it may be transported in specially insulated containers. Some donors have their own freezing apparatus to freeze and store their sperm.

===Techniques===
[[File:Scheme female reproductive system-en.svg|thumb|The [[female reproductive system|human female reproductive system]]. The cervix is part of the [[uterus]]. The [[cervical canal]] connects the interiors of the uterus and [[vagina]].]]
Semen used is used either fresh, raw, or frozen. Where donor sperm is supplied by a sperm bank, it will always be quarantined and frozen, and will need to be thawed before use. When an ovum is released, semen is introduced into the woman's [[vagina]], [[uterus]] or [[cervix]], depending on the method being used.

Sperm is occasionally inserted twice within a 'treatment cycle'.

====Intracervical insemination====
Intracervical insemination (ICI) is painless and is the easiest and most common insemination technique. It closely replicates the ejaculation of semen by the penis into the vagina during intercourse.

ICI involves the introduction of unwashed or raw semen into the vagina at the entrance to the [[cervix]], usually by means of a needleless syringe. 

It is the simplest type of artificial insemination, and unwashed or raw semen is normally used, but semen supplied by a donor through a sperm bank which has been prepared for IUI use may also be used. The procedure is commonly used in home, self-insemination and practitioner insemination procedures, and for insemination where semen is provided by private donors.

In order to perform an ICI insemination, air must be expelled from a needle-less syringe which is then filled with semen which has been allowed to liquify. Any further enclosed air must be removed by gently pressing the plunger forward. The woman lies on her back and the syringe is then inserted into the vagina. Care is optimal when inserting the syringe, so that the tip is as close to the entrance to the cervix as possible. A vaginal speculum may be used for this purpose. The plunger is then slowly pushed forward and the semen in the syringe is gently emptied deep into the vagina. It is important that the syringe is emptied slowly for best results. The syringe may be left in place for several minutes before removal. The woman can bring herself to orgasm so that the cervix 'dips down' into the pool of semen, again replicating closely vaginal intercourse, and this may improve the success rate. The woman is advised to lie still for about half-an-hour to improve the success rate.

One insemination during a cycle is usually sufficient. Additional inseminations may not improve the chances of a pregnancy.

Ordinary sexual lubricants should not be used in the process, but special fertility or 'sperm-friendly' lubricants can be used for increased ease and comfort.

When performed at home without the presence of a professional, aiming the sperm in the vagina at the neck of the cervix may be more difficult to achieve and the effect may be to 'flood' the vagina with semen, rather than to target it specifically at the entrance to the cervix. This procedure is therefore sometimes referred to as intravaginal insemination (IVI).&lt;ref name="European Sperm Bank USA"/&gt; Sperm supplied by a sperm bank will be frozen and must be allowed to thaw before insemination. The sealed end of the straw itself must be cut off and the open end of the straw is usually fixed straight on to the tip of the syringe, allowing the contents to be drawn into the syringe. Sperm from more than one straw can generally be used in the same syringe. Where fresh semen is used, this must be allowed to liquefy before inserting it into the syringe, or alternatively, the syringe may be back-loaded.

A conception cap, which is a form of [[conception device]], may be inserted into the vagina following insemination and may be left in place for several hours. Using this method, a woman may go about her usual activities while the cervical cap holds the semen in the vagina close to the entrance to the cervix. Advocates of this method claim that it increases the chances of conception. One advantage with the conception device is that fresh, non-liquefied semen may be used. The partner or donor may ejaculate straight into the cap and this can be immediately inserted into the vagina. Other methods may be used to insert semen into the vagina notably involving different uses of a conception cap. This may, for example, be inserted filled with sperm which does not have to be liquefied. The male may therefore ejaculate straight into the cap. Alternatively, a specially designed conception cap with a tube attached may be inserted empty into the vagina after which liquefied semen is poured into the tube. These methods are designed to ensure that donor or partner semen is inseminated as close as possible to the cervix and that it is kept in place there to increase the chances of conception.

====Intrauterine insemination====
Intrauterine insemination (IUI) involves injection of washed sperm into the uterus with a [[catheter]]. If unwashed semen is used, it may elicit uterine cramping, expelling the semen and causing pain, due to content of [[prostaglandin]]s. (Prostaglandins are also the compounds responsible for causing the myometrium to contract and expel the menses from the uterus, during [[menstruation]].) Resting on the table for fifteen minutes after an IUI is optimal for the woman to increase the pregnancy rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/711566?src=mpnews&amp;spon=16&amp;uac=75071SJ|publisher=Medscape Medical News|title=Immobilization May Improve Pregnancy Rate After Intrauterine Insemination|author=Laurie Barclay|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike ICI, intrauterine insemination normally requires a medical practitioner to perform the procedure. A female under 30 years of age has optimal chances with IUI; for the man, a [[total motile spermatozoa|TMS]] of more than 5 million per ml is optimal.&lt;ref name=merviel&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merviel P, Heraud MH, Grenier N, Lourdel E, Sanguinet P, Copin H |title=Predictive factors for pregnancy after intrauterine insemination (IUI): An analysis of 1038 cycles and a review of the literature |journal=Fertil.

A promising cycle is one that offers two [[ovarian follicle|follicles]] measuring more than 16&amp;nbsp;mm, and [[estrogen]] of more than 500 pg/mL on the day of [[human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]] administration.&lt;ref name=merviel/&gt; A short period of ejaculatory abstinence before intrauterine insemination is associated with higher [[pregnancy rate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshburn PB, Alanis M, Matthews ML |title=A short period of ejaculatory abstinence before intrauterine insemination is associated with higher pregnancy rates |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 1|pages= 286–8|date=September 2009 |pmid=19732887 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.07.972 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[GnRH agonist]] administration at the time of implantation does not improve pregnancy outcome in intrauterine insemination cycles according to a [[randomized controlled trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellver J, Labarta E, Bosch E |title=GnRH agonist administration at the time of implantation does not improve pregnancy outcome in intrauterine insemination cycles: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 94|issue= 3|pages= 1065–71|date=June 2009 |pmid=19501354 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.04.044 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUI is a more efficient method of artificial insemination than ICI and, because of its generally higher success rate, is usually the insemination procedure of choice for single women and lesbians using donor semen in a fertility centre and who are less likely to have fertility issues of their own. Enabling the sperm to be inserted directly into the womb will produce a better chance of conceiving.

It is also a method used by couples using donor sperm in a fertility centre.

IUI can be used in conjunction with [[controlled ovarian hyperstimulation]] (COH). Still, [[advanced maternal age]] causes decreased success rates; women aged 38–39 years appear to have reasonable success during the first two cycles of ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI. However, for women aged over 40 years, there appears to be no benefit after a single cycle of COH/IUI.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Medical experts therefore recommend considering [[in vitro fertilization]] after one failed COH/IUI cycle for women aged over 40 years.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 1| volume = 94| pages = 144–148| year = 2010| doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.02.040| pmid = 19394605| journal = Fertility and Sterility| title = Poor success of gonadotropin-induced controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination for older women| last2 = Missmer | first1 = I. | first2 = S.| last3 = Hornstein | first3 = M.| last1 = Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A double intrauterine insemination theoretically increases pregnancy rates by decreasing the risk of missing the [[fertile window]] during ovulation. However, a [[randomized trial]] of insemination after [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] found no difference in live birth rate between single and double intrauterine insemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagis T, Haydardedeoglu B, Kilicdag EB, Cok T, Simsek E, Parlakgumus AH |title=Single versus double intrauterine insemination in multi-follicular ovarian hyperstimulation cycles: a randomized trial |journal=Hum Reprod |volume= 25|issue= 7|pages= 1684–90|date=May 2010 |pmid=20457669 |doi=10.1093/humrep/deq112 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrauterine tuboperitoneal insemination====
Intrauterine tuboperitoneal insemination (IUTPI) involves injection of washed sperm into both the uterus and [[fallopian tube]]s. The cervix is then clamped to prevent leakage to the vagina, best achieved with a specially designed double nut bivalve (DNB) speculum. The sperm is mixed to create a volume of 10 ml, sufficient to fill the [[uterine cavity]], pass through the interstitial part of the tubes and the [[ampulla]], finally reaching the [[peritoneal cavity]] and the [[Pouch of Douglas]] where it would be mixed with the peritoneal and [[follicular fluid]]. IUTPI can be useful in [[unexplained infertility]], mild or moderate male infertility, and mild or moderate endometriosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leonidas Mamas, M.D. |title=Comparison of fallopian tube sperm perfusion and intrauterine tuboperitoneal insemination:a prospective randomized study |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=735–740 |date=March 2006 |pmid= 16500346|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2005.08.025|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-tubal sub fertility, fallopian tube sperm perfusion may be the preferred technique over intrauterine insemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G S Shekhawat, MD|title=Intrauterine insemination versus Fallopian tube sperm perfusion in non-tubal infertility|journal=Internet Medical Journal|year=2012|url=http://internetmedicaljournal.blogspot.com/2012/01/intrauterine-insemination-versus.html|access-date=2012-01-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003115/http://internetmedicaljournal.blogspot.com/2012/01/intrauterine-insemination-versus.html|archive-date=2014-05-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intratubal insemination====
Intratubal insemination (ITI) involves injection of washed sperm into the [[fallopian tube]], although this procedure is no longer generally regarded as having any beneficial effect compared with IUI.&lt;ref name=hurd&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hurd WW, Randolph JF, Ansbacher R, Menge AC, Ohl DA, Brown AN |title=Comparison of intracervical, intrauterine, and intratubal techniques for donor insemination |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=339–42 |date=February 1993 |pmid=8425628}}&lt;/ref&gt; ITI however, should not be confused with [[gamete intrafallopian transfer]], where both eggs and sperm are mixed outside the woman's body and then immediately inserted into the fallopian tube where fertilization takes place.

===Pregnancy rate===
[[Image:Success rates by amount of sperm.svg|thumb|right|250px|Approximate pregnancy rate as a function of [[total sperm count]] (may be twice as large as [[total motile sperm count]]). Values are for intrauterine insemination. (Old data, rates are likely higher today){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}]]
{{main|Pregnancy rate}}
The pregnancy or success rates for artificial insemination are 10 to 15% per [[menstrual cycle]] using ICI,&lt;ref name=utrecht&gt;[http://faqs.cs.uu.nl/na-dir/medicine/infertility-faq/part4.html Utrecht CS News] Subject: Infertility FAQ (part 4/4)&lt;/ref&gt; and 15–20% per cycle for IUI.&lt;ref name=utrecht/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2010}} In IUI, about 60 to 70% have achieved pregnancy after 6 cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Intrauterine insemination. Information notes from the fertility clinic at Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby. By PhD Ulrik Kesmodel et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these pregnancy rates may be very misleading, since many factors, including the age and health of the recipient, have to be included to give a meaningful answer, e.g. definition of success and calculation of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980513092650/http://ivf.com/success.html IVF.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For couples with [[unexplained infertility]], unstimulated IUI is no more effective than natural means of conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fertility treatments 'no benefit' |newspaper=BBC News |date=7 August 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7547400.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bhattacharya S, Harrild K, Mollison J |title=Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial |journal=BMJ |volume=337 |issue= |pages=a716 |year=2008 |pmid=18687718 |pmc=2505091 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a716|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pregnancy rate also depends on the [[total sperm count]], or, more specifically, the [[total motile sperm count]] (TMSC), used in a cycle. The success rate increases with increasing TMSC, but only up to a certain count, when other factors become limiting to success. The summed pregnancy rate of two cycles using a TMSC of 5 million (may be a TSC of ~10 million on graph) in each cycle is substantially higher than one single cycle using a TMSC of 10 million. However, although more cost-efficient, using a lower TMSC also increases the average time taken to achieve pregnancy. Women whose age is becoming a major [[Female infertility#General factors|factor in fertility]] may not want to spend that extra time.

===Samples per child===
The number of samples (ejaculates) required to give rise to a child varies substantially from person to person, as well as from clinic to clinic. However, the following equations generalize the main factors involved:

For '''intracervical insemination''':
:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{V_s \times c \times r_s}{n_r} &lt;/math&gt;

* ''N'' is how many children a single sample can give rise to.
* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of a sample (ejaculate), usually between 1.0&amp;nbsp;[[milliliters|mL]] and 6.5&amp;nbsp;mL&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web | last = Essig | first = Maria G. | editor1-first = Susan|editor1-last=Van Houten|editor2-first=Tracy|editor2-last=Landauer|others=Reviewed by Martin Gabica and Avery L.

*''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the pregnancy rate per cycle, between 10% to 35% &lt;ref name="utrecht"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cryos4&gt;[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/clinics/questions-answers.aspx#5351 Cryos International&amp;nbsp;– What is the expected pregnancy rate (PR) using your donor semen?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107151459/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/clinics/questions-answers.aspx#5351 |date=January 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[total motile sperm count]] recommended for vaginal insemination (VI) or intra-cervical insemination (ICI), approximately 20 million pr. ml.&lt;ref name=Cryos5&gt;[http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx#7169 Cryos International&amp;nbsp;– How much sperm should I order?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172939/http://dk.cryosinternational.com/private-customers/questions-answers.aspx |date=2013-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pregnancy rate increases with increasing number of motile sperm used, but only up to a certain degree, when other factors become limiting instead.

{{hidden|Derivation of the equation (click at right to view)| In the simplest form, the equation reads:
:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{n_s}{n_c} \times r_s&lt;/math&gt;

:''N'' is how many children a single sample can give rise to
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of vials produced per sample
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of vials used in a cycle
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the pregnancy rate per cycle

''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; can be further split into:

:&lt;math&gt;n_s = \frac{V_s}{V_v} &lt;/math&gt;
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of vials produced per sample
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of a sample
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of the vials used

''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; may be split into:
:&lt;math&gt;n_c = \frac{n_r}{n_s} &lt;/math&gt;
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of vials used in a cycle
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of motile sperm recommended for use in a cycle
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of motile sperm in a vial

''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; may be split into:
:&lt;math&gt;n_s = V_v \times c &lt;/math&gt;
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of motile sperm in a vial
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of the vials used
:''c'' is the concentration of motile sperm in a sample

Thus, the factors can be presented as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{V_s \times c \times r_s}{n_r} \times \frac{V_v}{V_v} &lt;/math&gt;
:''N'' is how many children a single sample can help giving rise to
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of a sample
:''c'' is the concentration of motile sperm in a sample
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the pregnancy rate per cycle
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of motile sperm recommended for use in a cycles
:''V''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of the vials used (its value doesn't affect ''N'' and may be eliminated. In short, the smaller the vials, the more vials are used)
}}

[[Image:Live birth rates by TMSC.svg|thumb|right|250px|Approximate live birth rate (''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) among infertile couples as a function of [[total motile sperm count]] (''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;). Values are for intrauterine insemination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}]]

With these numbers, one sample would on average help giving rise to 0.1–0.6 children, that is, it actually takes on average 2–5 samples to make a child.

For '''intrauterine insemination''', a ''centrifugation fraction'' (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;) may be added to the equation:
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the fraction of the volume that remains after centrifugation of the sample, which may be about half (0.5) to a third (0.33).

:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{V_s \times f_c \times c \times r_s}{n_r} &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, only 5 million motile sperm may be needed per cycle with IUI (''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;=5 million)&lt;ref name="cryos4"/&gt;

Thus, only 1–3 samples may be needed for a child if used for IUI.

===Social implications===
One of the key issues arising from the rise of  dependency on [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ARTs) is the pressure placed on couples to conceive; 'where children are highly desired, parenthood is culturally mandatory, and childlessness socially unacceptable'.&lt;ref name=Inhorn&gt;{{cite journal |first=Marcia C. |last=Inhorn |title=Global infertility and the globalization of new reproductive technologies: Illustrations from Egypt |journal=Social Science and Medicine|volume=56 |issue=9 |pages=1837–51 |year=2003 |doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00208-3 |pmid=12650724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[medicalization]] of infertility creates a framework in which individuals are encouraged to think of infertility quite negatively. In many cultures donor insemination is religiously and culturally prohibited, often meaning that less accessible "high tech" and expensive ARTs, like IVF, are the only solution.

An over-reliance on reproductive technologies in dealing with infertility prevents many&amp;nbsp;– especially, for example, in the "[[Female infertility#Social stigma|infertility belt]]" of central and southern Africa&amp;nbsp;– from dealing with many of the key causes of infertility treatable by artificial insemination techniques; namely preventable infections, dietary and lifestyle influences.&lt;ref name=Inhorn/&gt; 

If good records are not kept, the offspring when grown up risk [[accidental incest]].

=== Morality in Christianity ===
An [[Anglican]] writer says that, "To achieve union but not children by means of contraceptives and to achieve children but not union by means of artificial insemination are both equally wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Morals and Medicine: The Moral Problems of the Patient's Right to Know the Truth, Contraception, Artificial Insemination, Sterilization, Euthanasia |author=Joseph F. Fletcher |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9781400868377 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosexual intercourse is viewed by the Catholic Church as an act meant to be experienced only by married couples; it is viewed as a physical representation of the spiritual unity of marriage between a husband and wife. According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', artificial insemination "dissociates the sexual act from the procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by two persons giving themselves to one another, but one that 'entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is, in itself, contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children'".&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=2377|long=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal restrictions ===
Some countries restrict artificial insemination in a variety of ways. For example, some countries do not permit AI for single women, and some Muslim countries do not permit the use of donor sperm. As of May 2013, the following European countries permit medically assisted AI for single women:

==In animals==
[[File:Inseminatie (4494727256).jpg|thumb|A man performing artificial insemination of a cow.]]
[[File:Horse breeding dummy.jpg|right|thumb|A [[breeding mount]] with built-in [[artificial vagina]] used in [[semen collection]] from horses for use in artificial insemination]]

AI is useful for pets, [[livestock]], [[endangered species]], and animals in zoos or [[marine park]]s difficult to transport. 


===Reasons and techniques===
{{See also|Captive breeding}}
It may be used for many reasons, including to allow a male to inseminate a much larger number of females, to allow use of genetic material from males separated by distance or time, to overcome physical breeding difficulties, to control the paternity of offspring, to synchronise births, to avoid injury incurred during natural mating, and to avoid the need to keep a male at all (such as for small numbers of females or in species whose fertile males may be difficult to manage).

[[semen collection|Semen is collected]], extended, then cooled or frozen. It can be used on site or shipped to the female's location. If frozen, the small plastic tube holding the semen is referred to as a ''straw''. To allow the sperm to remain viable during the time before and after it is frozen, the semen is mixed with a solution containing glycerol or other cryoprotectants. An ''[[Semen extender|extender]]'' is a solution that allows the semen from a donor to impregnate more females by making insemination possible with fewer sperm. Antibiotics, such as streptomycin, are sometimes added to the sperm to control some bacterial venereal diseases. Before the actual insemination, [[estrus]] may be induced through the use of [[progestogen]] and another [[hormone]] (usually [[Equine chorionic gonadotropin|PMSG]] or [[Prostaglandin F2α]]).

===History===
[[File:Instrumentos de IA en 1936.GIF|thumb|IA tools brought from the USSR by [[Luis Thomasset]] in 1935 to work at Cambridge Laboratories and South America.]]
The first viviparous to be artificially fertilized was a dog. The experiment was conducted with success by the Italian [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] in 1780. Another pioneer was the Russian [[Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov|Ilya Ivanov]] since 1899. In 1935 Suffolk sheep diluted semen was sent from Cambridge by plane to Krakow, Poland, and international research joint (Prawochenki from Poland, Milovanoff from USSR, Hammond from Cambridge, Walton from Scotland, and Thomasset from Uruguay).

Modern artificial insemination was pioneered by John O. Almquist of the Pennsylvania State University.  His improvement of breeding efficiency by the use of antibiotics (first proven with penicillin in 1946) to control bacterial growth, decreasing embrionic mortality and increase fertility, and various new techniques for processing, freezing and thawing of frozen semen significantly enhanced the practical utilization of AI in the livestock industry, and earned him the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ilan |last=Chet |chapter=John O. Almquist |title=Wolf Prize in Agriculture |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1v2vJmdAj84C&amp;pg=PA121 |year=2009 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-283-585-7 |pages=121–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1981 [[Wolf Foundation Prize]] in Agriculture.  Many techniques developed by him have since been applied to other species, including that of the human male.

===Species===
Artificial insemination is used in many non-human animals, including [[sheep]], [[horse breeding|horse]]s, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equine-reproduction.com/articles/insemination.htm|title=Equine Artificial Insemination|website=www.equine-reproduction.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[cattle]], [[pigs]], [[canine reproduction|dog]]s,  [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigree]] animals generally, [[zoo]] animals, [[Domestic turkey|turkey]]s and even [[Western honey bee|honeybees]].  

Artificial insemination of farm animals is very common in today's agriculture industry in the developed world, especially for breeding dairy cattle (75% of all inseminations&lt;!-- Is this of all inseminations of dairy cows, or all inseminations of dairy cows by dairy bulls?  (Many dairy cows are crossed with beef bulls to produce crossbred beef, usually using natural insemination) --&gt;). [[Swine]] are also bred using this method (up to 85% of all inseminations). It provides an economical means for a livestock breeder to improve their herds utilizing males having very desirable traits.

Although common with cattle and swine, AI is not as widely practised in the [[horse breeding|breeding of horses]]. A small number of equine associations in North America accept only horses that have been conceived by "natural cover"  or "natural service"&amp;nbsp;– the actual physical mating of a [[mare]] to a [[stallion]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[Jockey Club]] being the most notable of these, as no AI is allowed in [[Thoroughbred]] breeding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darleyflyingstart.com/2006/work/july07_sun_pathak.shtml The Jockey Club has never allowed artificial insemination.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920004757/http://www.darleyflyingstart.com/2006/work/july07_sun_pathak.shtml |date=September 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other registries such as the [[AQHA]] and [[warmblood]] registries allow registration of foals created through AI, and the process is widely used allowing the breeding of mares to stallions not resident at the same facility&amp;nbsp;– or even in the same country&amp;nbsp;– through the use of transported frozen or cooled semen.

In modern species conservation, semen collection and artificial insemination is used also in birds. In 2013 scientist of the Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen, Germany, from the working group of Michael Lierz, Clinic for birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, developed a novel technique for semen collection and artificial insemination in parrots producing the world's first macaw by assisted reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lierz M, Reinschmidt M, Müller H, Wink M, Neumann D |title=A novel method for semen collection and artificial insemination in large parrots (Psittaciformes) |journal=Sci Rep |volume=3 |issue= |pages=2066 |year=2013 |pmid=23797622 |pmc=3691562 |doi=10.1038/srep02066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blunt trauma''', '''blunt injury''', '''non-penetrating trauma''' or '''blunt force trauma''' is [[physical trauma]] to a body part, either by impact, injury or physical attack. The latter is usually referred to as blunt force trauma. Blunt trauma is the initial trauma, from which develops more specific types such as [[contusion]]s, [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]], [[laceration]]s, and/or [[bone fracture]]s.  Blunt trauma is contrasted with [[penetrating trauma]], in which an object such as a projectile or knife enters the body.

It is important to note that initially there may be little in the way of overt clinical signs to indicate that serious internal abdominal injury has occurred, making assessment more challenging and requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion.&lt;ref name="Management of Abdominal Trauma"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fitzgerald |first1= J.E.F. |author-link1= |last2=Larvin |first2=Mike |author-link2= |last3= |first3= |author-link3= |last4= |first4= |author-link4= |last5= |first5= |author-link5= |display-authors= |author-mask= |last-author-amp= |date= |year=2009 |orig-year= |chapter= Chapter 15: Management of Abdominal Trauma |script-chapter= |trans-chapter= |chapter-url= |chapter-format= |editor1-last=Baker |editor1-first=Qassim |editor1-link= |editor2-last=Aldoori |editor2-first=Munther |editor2-link= |editor3-last= |editor3-first= |editor3-link= |editor4-last= |editor4-first= |editor4-link= |editor5-last= |editor5-first= |editor5-link= |display-editors= |title=Clinical Surgery: A Practical Guide |script-title= |trans-title= |url= |dead-url= |format= |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |others= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |publication-date= |page= |pages=192–204 |at= |nopp= |arxiv= |bibcode= |doi= |isbn=9781444109627 |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |subscription= |lay-summary= |lay-source= |lay-date= |quote= |name-list-format= |mode= |postscript= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic physical mechanisms at play with the potential of injury to intra-abdominal organs: compression and deceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Intestinal Injury from Blunt Abdominal Trauma: A Study of 47 Cases | author=Mukhopadhyay M | date=October 2009 | journal=Oman Med J | volume=24 |issue=4 | pages=256–259 |pmid=22216378 |pmc=3243872 | doi=10.5001/omj.2009.52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former occurs from a direct blow, such as a punch, or compression against a non-yielding object such as a seat belt or steering column.
This force may deform a hollow organ thereby increasing its intra-luminal or internal pressure, leading to rupture.  Deceleration, on the other hand, causes stretching and shearing at the points at which mobile structures, such as the bowel, are anchored.  This can cause tearing of the [[mesentery]] of the bowel, and injury to the blood vessels that travel within the mesentery.  Classic examples of these mechanisms are a [[hepatic]] tear along the [[Round ligament of liver|ligamentum teres]] and injuries to the [[renal artery|renal arteries]].

When blunt abdominal trauma is complicated by 'internal injury', the [[liver]] and [[spleen]] (see [[blunt splenic trauma]]) are most frequently involved, followed by the [[intestine|small intestine]].

In rare cases, this injury has been attributed to medical techniques such as the [[Heimlich Maneuver]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mack L, Forbes TL, Harris KA |title=Acute aortic thrombosis following incorrect application of the Heimlich maneuver |journal=Ann Vasc Surg |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=130–3 |date=January 2002 |pmid=11904818 |doi=10.1007/s10016-001-0147-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts at [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation#Complications|cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and manual thrusts to clear an airway.  Although these are rare examples, it has been suggested that they are caused by applying unnecessary pressure when administering such techniques.  Finally, the occurrence of splenic rupture with mild blunt abdominal trama in those convalescing from [[infectious mononucleosis]] is well reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor TE, Skinner LJ, Kiely P, Fenton JE |title=Return to contact sports following infectious mononucleosis: the role of serial ultrasonography |journal=Ear Nose Throat J |volume=90 |issue=8 |pages=E21–4 |date=August 2011 |pmid=21853428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
In all but the most obviously trivial injuries, the first concern is to exclude anything that might be quickly or immediately life-threatening.  This is resolved by ascertaining that the subject's airway is open and competent, that breathing is unlabored, and that circulation—i.e. pulses that can be felt—is present.  This is sometimes described as the "A, B, C's"—Airway, Breathing, and Circulation—and is the first step in any resuscitation or triage.  Then, the history of the accident or injury is amplified with any medical, dietary (timing of last oral intake) and past history, from whatever sources such as family, friends, previous treating physicians that might be available.  This method is sometimes given the mnemonic "[[SAMPLE history|SAMPLE]]".  The amount of time spent on diagnosis should be minimized and expedited by a combination of clinical assessment and appropriate use of technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woods SD |title=Assessment of blunt abdominal trauma |journal=Aust N Z J Surg |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=75–6 |date=February 1995 |pmid=7857232 |doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.1995.tb07263.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[diagnostic peritoneal lavage|diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)]], or [[Focused assessment with sonography for trauma|bedside ultrasound examination (FAST)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marco GG, Diego S, Giulio A, Luca S |title=Screening US and CT for blunt abdominal trauma: a retrospective study |journal=Eur J Radiol |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=97–101 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16168270 |doi=10.1016/j.ejrad.2005.02.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0720-048X(05)00048-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; before proceeding to [[laparotomy]] if required.  If time and the patient's stability permits, CT examination may be carried out if available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jansen JO, Yule SR, Loudon MA |title=Investigation of blunt abdominal trauma |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7650 |pages=938–42 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18436949 |pmc=2335258 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39534.686192.80 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18436949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its advantages include superior definition of the injury, leading to grading of the injury and sometimes the confidence to avoid or postpone surgery.  Its disadvantages include the time taken to acquire images, although this gets shorter with each generation of scanners, and the removal of the patient from the immediate view of the emergency or surgical staff.

Recently, criteria have been defined that might allow patients with blunt abdominal trauma to be discharged safely without further evaluation.  The characteristics of such patients would include:
* absence of intoxication
* no evidence of lowered blood pressure or raised pulse rate
* no abdominal pain or tenderness
* no blood in the urine.  
To be considered low risk, patients would need to meet all low-risk criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kendall JL, Kestler AM, Whitaker KT, Adkisson MM, Haukoos JS |title=Blunt abdominal trauma patients are at very low risk for intra-abdominal injury after emergency department observation |journal=West J Emerg Med |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=496–504 |date=November 2011 |pmid=22224146 |pmc=3236146 |doi=10.5811/westjem.2010.11.2016 |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8753v7ms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blunt abdominal trauma in sports===

In the US, the majority of contact-collision injuries, usually blunt trauma, should have been witnessed in high school or collegiate games where the athletic training staff are trained to keep their eyes on the play. This may allow some departure from [[Advanced trauma life support|Advanced Trauma Life Support]] guidelines in the initial assessment, although the principles always apply. The major priority then becomes separating contusions and musculo-tendinous injuries from injuries to solid organs and the gut and recognizing potential for developing blood loss, and reacting accordingly. Blunt injuries to the [[kidney]] from helmets, shoulder pads, and knees are also described in American football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brophy RH, Gamradt SC, Barnes RP |title=Kidney injuries in professional American football: implications for management of an athlete with 1 functioning kidney |journal=Am J Sports Med |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=85–90 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17986635 |doi=10.1177/0363546507308940 |url=http://ajs.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17986635|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; association football, martial arts, and all-terrain vehicle accidents.

== Treatment ==
In every case where the presumption of internal injury has been sufficient to trigger the diagnostic steps outlined above, intravenous access will be established and [[Volume expanders|crystalloid solutions]] and/or blood will be administered at rates sufficient to maintain the circulation. Thereafter, further treatment will depend on the grade of organ damage estimated by the prior investigations and will vary from close observation with the ability to intervene quickly, or surgery, open or [[Laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=D'Errico E, Goffre B, Mazza D |title=Blunt abdominal trauma: current management |journal=Chir Ital |volume=61 |issue=5-6 |pages=601–6 |year=2009 |pmid=20380265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of blunt abdominal trauma, there is no shown benefit from surgery unless bleeding is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oyo-Ita|first=Angela|last2=Chinnock|first2=Paul|last3=Ikpeme|first3=Ikpeme A.|date=2015-11-13|year=|title=Surgical versus non-surgical management of abdominal injury|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=11|pages=CD007383|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007383.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26568111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bundesverband der Pharmazeutischen Industrie''' ('''BPI''') founded after WWII with headquarters in Berlin is a German [[Non-profit association]] and [[trade group]] for [[Small and medium-sized enterprises]] in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. {{As of| 2017}} it represented 250 classic [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] companies, pharmaceutical service providers, [[biotech]] companies, herbal medicines and homeopathy/anthroposophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpi.de/bpi/der-bpi/portrait/|title=BPI - Partner im Gesundheitswesen: Portrait|website=www.bpi.de|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with altogether approximately 78,000 employees. BPI´s focus has been on [[political consulting]] and [[public relations]] on the [[EU]]-level in order to enhance development in the national and international health care systems.

==History==
The Bundesverband der Pharmazeutischen Industrie (BPI) was founded after WWII with headquarters in Berlin as an [[Eingetragener Verein]]. It is the German [[industry association]] or [[trade group]] for a broad spectrum of companies in the [[pharmaceutical industry]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} BPI works

Large pharmaceutical companies in Germany are represented by the [[Verband Forschender Arzneimittelhersteller]] ("Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies", vfa)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vfa.de/en/about-us-member-companies About us &amp; Member Companies] Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (vfa), retrieved 5 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pharmaceutical industry association in Germany, the [[Bundesverband der Arzneimittelhersteller]] ("German Medicines Manufacturers' Association", BAH), has about 450 company members including 150 traditional pharmaceutical manufacturers and about 150 other members with a business interest in healthcare, such as publishers and [[polling organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bah-bonn.de/en/bah-bundesverband-der-arzneimittel-hersteller-ev/ Bundesverband der Arzneimittelhersteller] German Medicines Manufacturers' Association, in English, accessed 4 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of BPI begins with the health of man and works towards enhancing the health care system to become more future-oriented. The company works towards this goal by aiding and consulting in several aspects of pharmaceutical and medical device development and improving market chances.

==Function==
BPI´s focus has been on [[political consulting]] and [[public relations]] on the [[EU]]-level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.de/bpi/bpi-europa-vertretung/bpi-europa-repraesentanz/|title=BPI - Partner im Gesundheitswesen: BPI-Europa-Repräsentanz|website=Bpi.de|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; BPI headquarters is located in Berlin. There is also an office in [[Brussels]].

Cannabis was introduced to Cuba as a textile crop in 1793, but planters on the island found sugar to be a more lucrative crop.&lt;ref name="Abel2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=E.L. Abel|title=Marihuana: The First Twelve Thousand Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGgzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|date=29 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4899-2189-5|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1949, prior to the [[Cuban Revolution]], a journal noted that most of the cannabis found in Cuba was imported from Mexico, but it was increasingly grown on the island, and was receiving attention in medical, juridical, and police publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Marihuana in Latin America: the threat it constitutes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSJXAAAAMAAJ|year=1949|publisher=Linacre Press|pages=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3224">'''[[Decontamination]] foam''' (known commonly as '''Decon foam''') is a spray-on [[Washing|cleaning]] [[solution]] that, due to its physical properties, has a longer residence time on contaminated surfaces than regular liquids and thus provides efficient decontamination of biological and chemical contaminants (e.g. [[chemical warfare|chemical warfare agents]], [[anthrax|anthrax spores]] or other [[toxic industrial materials]] (TIM)). The composition of decontamination foams is essentially water and a surfactant, creating an [[Firefighting foam#Synthetic foams|aqueous film forming foam]] that various reactive chemicals are then added, diminishing the amount of contaminants adhering to a surface and forming less hazardous products. Common reactants are hydrogen peroxide and quaternary ammonium complexes (QACs).

It is designed for use in emergency situations involving areas containing large numbers of possibly contaminated people e.g. at [[Convention (meeting)|convention]]s, [[airport]]s, [[concert]]s etc.

==Benefits of decontamination foam==
The two main benefits of decontamination foam over liquid decontaminants (chlorine, decontamination solutions, etc.) are its effectiveness on non horizontal surfaces and its high air to liquid ratio. Other decontaminants are difficult to apply to walls and ceilings due to poor adhesion, however decon foam is much better at adhering to surfaces, which increases the amount of time for the decontamination reaction to take place. Additionally, the high air to liquid ratio allows the foam to be used without over-applying the decontaminant. This high ratio also allows a small amount of liquid to cover a relatively large area in the event of a major contamination.

==Soap cannons and other foam delivery systems in practice==
The [[LAX]] airport soap cannon can spray large quantities of decon foam on crowds of potentially exposed persons, e.g. to [[mass decontamination|decon]] an entire planeload of people who might be victims of a nuclear, chemical, or biological agent release.

==Mixing and use==
Decon foam often comes in multiple bottles, that, when mixed, combine to form the decontamination solution. The bottles should be kept separate until needed as the foam may begin to lose effectiveness after mixing. After these bottles are mixed together, the foam can be applied by spraying it on a contaminated area or by manual application.

==Use for crowd control==
Decon foam is also useful as an [[area denial weapons]] medium for [[crowd control]], e.g. to make the ground slippery, as well as to reduce [[visibility]] (as a [[fog]]), such as with the CASCAD product.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16182">'''Diana M. Zuckerman''' (born 16 June 1950&lt;ref&gt;http://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?AuthRecID=3305166&amp;v1=1&amp;HC=1&amp;SEQ=20071211042258&amp;PID=27945 {{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Americans|American]] health policy analyst who focuses on the implications of policies for public health and patients’ health. She is an expert on national health policy, particularly in [[women's health]] and the safety and effectiveness of medical products. She is the President of the [[National Center for Health Research]] (formerly National Research Center for Women &amp; Families) and [[the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopcancerfund.org/|title=Stop Cancer Fund - Information you can use. A voice you can trust.|work=stopcancerfund.org|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Zuckerman earned her B.A. in [[psychology]] from [[Smith College]] and then obtained a [[Ph.D]] in [[psychology]] from [[THE Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] in 1977. At [[Yale Medical School]] she was a post-doctoral fellow in [[epidemiology]] and [[public health]] from 1979 to 1980.

==Career==
She was on the faculty at [[Vassar College]] and [[Yale University]], and directed a longitudinal study of college students as director of the Seven College Study at [[Harvard University]], publishing books and articles on the impact of media on children, the impact of religion on the health of the elderly, and how women's life experiences influence their mental and physical health. She left academia in 1983 when she was selected as a Fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science Congressional Science Fellowship program.&lt;ref name=center4research&gt;[http://www.center4research.org/about-us/key-staff/ National Research Center for Women &amp; Families staff listing] Retrieved June 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1985 to 1993 she worked at the [[U.S. Congress]] in a House subcommittee where she was responsible for a dozen Congressional oversight investigations on health and social policy, including political manipulation of government grants to prevent [[child abuse]], lack of safeguards for [[infertility treatment]]s, financial conflicts of interest among [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) grant recipients, and the lack of safety studies on [[breast implant]]s. Information from the hearings received widespread public health, government, and media attention, resulting in several policy and regulatory changes, including the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) requiring implant manufacturers to submit safety studies for the first time.&lt;ref name=center4research/&gt;

In 1993, Zuckerman joined the staff of the [[Senate Veterans Affairs Committee]] and began an investigation that resulted in the first Congressional hearings focused on the possible causes of [[Gulf War syndrome]]. In 1995 she was a senior policy advisor in the [[Clinton Administration]]. From 1996, she undertook leading roles in [[non-profit organization]]s, including, from 1999, presidency of the National Research Center for Women &amp; Families&lt;ref name=center4research/&gt; (renamed the [[National Center for Health Research]] in 2014) and [[The Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund]]. In 2010, she was inducted into the Women in Medicine International Hall of Fame by the American Medical Women's Association.

Her work focuses on improving the quality of [[medical product]]s and healthcare in the United States. She has been highly critical of scientific and medical research paid for by companies, who then use this to promote their products, as well as the lack of media coverage on independently funded research that challenges industry-funded research. She has said:
:You've heard of junk science &amp;mdash; a term coined by corporations to describe research they don’t like &amp;mdash; but the real danger to public health might be called "checkbook science": research intended not to expand knowledge or to benefit humanity, but instead to sell products.&lt;ref name=hype&gt;Zuckerman, Diana (2002)[http://www.fair.org/extra/0209/hype-health.html Hype in health reporting]. Retrieved August 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, Zuckerman and colleagues Paul Brown and Dr. [[Steven Nissen]] published a study in the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]'', which evaluated the FDA’s recalls of devices that the agency considered potentially deadly or otherwise very high risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zuckerman DM, Brown P, Nissen SE|title=Medical device recalls and the FDA approval process|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=171|issue=11|pages=1006–11|date=June 2011|pmid=21321283|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on FDA data, the authors determined that most of the devices that were high-risk recalls had never been studied in [[clinical trials]] prior to FDA approval, and that the FDA needed to use more stringent criteria for implanted medical devices and those used to diagnose serious illnesses, and an editorial in the same issue agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Redberg RF, Dhruva SS|title=Medical device recalls: get it right the first time: Comment on "Medical device recalls and the FDA approval process"|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|volume=171 |issue=11|pages=1011–2|date=June 2011|pmid=21321286|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/not-enough-safety-testing-on-medical-implant-devices-studies-claim/|title=Not enough safety testing on medical implant devices, studies claim|date=September 30, 2014|work=cbsnews.com|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/medical-devices-lack-safety-evidence-study-finds-1412017201|title=Medical Devices Lack Safety Evidence, Study Finds|author=Thomas M.

In April 2011, Zuckerman presented the results of the study at a hearing of the [[United States Senate Special Committee on Aging|U.S. Senate Senate Special Committee on Aging]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aging.senate.gov{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerman is the author of five books, several book chapters, and dozens of articles in medical and academic journals, and in newspapers across the country. Her policy work has resulted in news coverage on all the major TV networks, including [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], public television, ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[20/20]]'', [[National Public Radio]], and in major U.S. print media such as ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/business/09device.html|author=Gardiner Harris|title=F.D.A. to Check Safety of Old Devices|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 8, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/health/policy/27device.html|title=Quickly Vetted, Treatment Is Offered to Patients|author=Reed Abelson|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 27, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/us/long-term-data-on-complications-adds-to-criticism-of-contraceptive-implant.html|author=Ronio Caryn Rabin|title=Long-Term Data on Complications Adds to Criticism of Essure Contraceptive Implant|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 3, 2015|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/business/knee-replacement-device-unapproved-but-used-in-surgery.html|title=Knee Replacement Device Unapproved, but Used in Surgery|author=Marshall Allen|author2=Olga Pierce|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=February 6, 2015|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/04/AR2005120400887.html|title=Implant Maker Fixed Samples Only|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=December 4, 2005|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Times]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/23/nation/la-na-breast-implants-20110623|title=Breast implants: FDA stands by silicone implants|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 23, 2011|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Boston Globe]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/02/19/hip-implants-bit-more-likely-fail-women/0TTTL3ztxYQ9gyI43RR2fL/story.html|title=Hip implants a bit more likely to fail in women|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2005/04/14/fda_panel_supports_firms_breast_implant/|title=FDA panel supports firm's breast implant|work=boston.com|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', ''[[New York Daily News]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', ''[[Family Circle]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Self (magazine)|Self]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.self.com/wellness/health/2011/01/cheap-cosmetic-surgery/|title=The True Price of Cheap Cosmetic Surgery|author=SELF Staffers|work=[[Self (magazine)|SELF]]|date=January 26, 2011|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many other newspapers, magazines, and radio programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://center4research.org/about-us/key-staff/|title=Key Staff|publisher=[[National Center for Health Research]]|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408187_3|title=Are Breast Implants Safe?|work=[[Medscape]]|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/25/us/politics/ap-us-contraception-device-fda.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testimonies===
Zuckerman has appeared before numerous FDA advisory committees to testify as a medical expert on a variety of drugs and devices.
 
On December 12, 2013, Zuckerman testified regarding the type-2 [[diabetes]] drug [[dapagliflozin]] (Farxiga), saying: "My concern about this drug is that there are just too many unanswered questions – and those unanswered questions are frightening ones. That was true when the FDA rejected this application for approval 2 years ago, and it is still true today." She cited studies that highlighted the risks that the drug poses, as well as methodological concerns such as a lack of diversity in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;http://center4research.org/public-policy/testimony-briefings-statements/statementdapagliflozin/{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 14, 2012, Zuckerman made a statement at a Capitol Hill press conference about the VALID Compounding Act. She stated that loopholes in the FDA law, including compounding pharmacies, have allowed hundreds of people to get sick with meningitis and several to die. The VALID Compounding Act is designed to close the loopholes that are so harmful to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopcancerfund.org/in-the-news/valid-compounding-press/|title=Statement by Dr. Diana Zuckerman, Capitol Hill Press Conference|publisher=[[The Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund]]|date=November 14, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], a person with a [[disability]] is defined as: "a person whose daily life or life in society is substantially limited over the long term due to a physical disability or mental disability".&lt;ref name = Iwakuma &gt;{{cite book|last=Iwakuma|first=Miho|editor-last=Kramer|editor-first=Eric Mark|title=The emerging monoculture : assimilation and the "model minority"|date=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780275973124|chapter=Being Disabled in Modern Japan: A Minority Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=125}} Japan ratified the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (CRPD) on 20 January 2014.

==Demographics==
In 1998 the government estimated that there were 5,753,000 people with disabilities in Japan, constituting about 4.8% of the total population. The totals of the three legally defined categories were: 3,170,000 [[Physical disability|physically disabled]]; 413,000 [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]]; and 4,170,000 have [[mental disorder|psychiatric disabilities]]. The physically disabled category was made up of people with the following impairments: 1,657,000 (56.5%) limb impairments; 305,000 (10.4%) are visually impaired; 350,000 (11.9%) have hearing impairments; while 621,000 (21.2%) had "internal disabilities" such as heart disease.&lt;ref name = Iwakuma/&gt;{{rp|pages=125-126}}&lt;!-- Look for more recent statistics --&gt;

==Legislation and government policy==
{{see also|Disability rights in Japan}}
Japan signed the CRPD in September 2007, but took until January 2014 to ratify it. The long delay was due to various legislative amendments and policy reforms that had to be in place before ratification.&lt;ref name=Mayumi&gt;{{cite web|first=Shirasawa |last=Mayumi |url=http://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00133/ |title=The Long Road to Disability Rights in Japan |publisher=Nippon.com |date=2014-10-02 |accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disabled Iranian veterans''', called '''''janbaz''''' ({{lang-fa|جانباز}}, literally "those who were willing to lose their lives") in [[Iran]],&lt;ref name=Stimson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Allen|last2=Kornblet|first2=Sarah|title=Advancing the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: A US–Iran Dialogue on Law, Policy, and Advocacy|url=http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Iran_and_America_A_Dialogue_on_Disability.pdf|website=Stimson|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly constitute the [[disabled]] [[veteran]]s of the [[Iran–Iraq war]]. According to Mohammad Esfandiari, director of communications and public relations of Iran’s Martyrs and Disabled Veterans’ Organization, there are 548,499 disabled veterans of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] living in Iran as of June 2014, a number which includes the victims of [[Iraq chemical attacks against Iran|Iraq's chemical weapon attacks on Iran]].&lt;ref name=AM&gt;{{cite news|last1=Samimi|first1=Mehrnaz|title=Iran's disabled veterans lack services|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/09/iran-veterans-iraq-war-disability.html#ixzz3xQrsHnVB|accessdate=16 January 2016|work=Al-Monitor|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are called "chemical ''janbaz''" ({{lang-fa|جانباز شیمیایی}}).

==Chemical warfare veterans==
After [[Iraq chemical attacks against Iran|Iraqi chemical attacks]] against Iranian soldiers and civilians, from 1983 to 1988, the number of people suffering injuries, including [[respiratory]] (42%), [[ocular]] (39%) and [[skin complications]] (25%) was more than 3,400 – a number which increased to at least 45,000 twenty years later, "due to the occurrence of late respiratory complications of [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] exposure."&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Najafi Mehri|first1=Soheil|last2=Ebadi|first2=Abbas|last3=Heravi Karimooi|first3=Majideh|last4=Foroughan|first4=Mahshid|last5=Sahraei|first5=Hedayat|title=Experiences Living with Fatigue in Iranian Veterans Chemically Injured by Sulfur Mustard Gas: A Phenomenological Study|journal=Asian Nursing Research|date=30 November 2012|volume=6|issue=4|pages=181–186|doi=10.1016/j.anr.2012.10.008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1976131712000709|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The latency period can be as much as 40 years" and "So almost every day there are new cases — 30 years after the war," said Shahriar Khateri, the co-founder of the Society for Chemical Weapons Victims Support. According to Farhad Hashemnezhad in 2002, at least 20 percent of the patients were "civilians who didn’t think they were close enough to be exposed." This large number of chemically affected veterans has made Iran the world’s largest laboratory for the study of the effects of [[chemical weapons]]. According to a declassified [[CIA]] report, as a result of Iraq’s repeated use of nerve agents and toxic gases in the 1980s, Iran suffered more than 50,000 casualties mostly by mustard gas used in dusty, liquid and vapor forms packed into [[bomb]]s and [[artillery]] shells which were then fired at the front lines and beyond, at targets such as hospitals. The number of registered chemically affected veterans was 70,000 by 2014, according to Shahriar Khateri, Iran’s leading expert on chemical weapons victims.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Robin|title=Iran Still Haunted and Influenced By Chemical Weapons Attacks|url=http://world.time.com/2014/01/20/iran-still-haunted-and-influenced-by-chemical-weapons-attacks/|accessdate=20 January 2016|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; "awareness could have saved lives," Khateri said.&lt;ref name=Guardian-1/&gt; Doctors estimate that the final toll of Iraq’s chemical weapons could be as high as 90,000, equal to the total deaths from all [[Chemical weapons in World War I|toxic gases in World War I]].&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

During the Iran–Iraq War, mustard gas was used by Iraq against Iran, and it was the "first time ever that nerve agents such as [[sarin]] and [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] were employed."&lt;ref name=Guardian-1/&gt; Experiencing the outcomes of the chemical weapons, chemical warfare veterans believe that the younger generations should be instructed that "war is not a computer game." "We want to show how painful the consequences are. We don't want revenge. We just want to show what happens so it won't happen again," said Saadi, injured by Iraqi mustard gas.&lt;ref name=Guardian-1/&gt;

==Psychiatric veterans==
The number of mentally disabled veterans including those who suffer from [[PTSD]] is increasing some of them increasingly showing signs of mental issues and the mental health conditions have worsened with age in others.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt;
==Services==
In [[Tehran]] alone there are very few [[wheelchair]]-accessible [[Wheelchair ramp|ramps]], elevators and parking spots
and the problem is more serious in smaller cities. This is while over 5,000 disabled Iranian veterans, mostly living in the capital, are restricted to wheelchairs for mobility. According to the Tehran Metro Group many more elevators are needed in Tehran’s subway system. To provide better services for disabled veterans, the Iranian government has announced that around $5 million has been dedicated to constructing ramps and wheelchair-accessible paths throughout Tehran. No similar official plans are dedicated for other cities in Iran. &lt;ref name=AM/&gt;

In Tehran, chemical weapons victims are often referred to the Sasan Hospital.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

The [[Tehran Peace Museum]] plans to focus on the enduring human consequences of Iran–Iraq War and serves as a centre for surviving victims of the war, especially chemical warfare veterans attacked by Saddam Hussein's forces.&lt;ref name=Guardian-1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Black|first1=Ian|last2=editor|first2=Middle East|title=The legacy of chemical warfare|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/26/iran-iraq-war|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=The Guardian|date=24 November 2008|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to numerous laws and regulations the Iranian government has passed to address disability related issues, the Disability Protect Act, including 16 articles
providing legal protections for disabled persons in areas such as public building access, education, housing and finance, has been Iran’s
most progressive and comprehensive legislation concerning disabled persons which was passed in 2003.&lt;ref name=Stimson/&gt;

The ''Janbazan'' Foundation is created by Iran government for the assistance of Iranian disabled veterans and for giving them special treatment.&lt;ref name=Stimson/&gt; They also receive services such as financial loan from [[Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last1=Wehrey|first1=Frederic|last2=Green|first2=Jerrold D.|last3=Nichiporuk|first3=Brian|last4=Nader|first4=Alireza|last5=Nafisi|first5=Rasool|last6=Hansell|first6=Lydia|last7=Bohandy|first7=S.

==In popular culture==
Veterans are presented with awards and are thanked for their service on formalities such as ceremonies which are plentiful and widely covered in the Iranian media, particularly on two annual national occasions, namely Disabled Veterans’ Day in May and [[Sacred Defence Week]] (Sept. 20–27), which commemorates the commencement of the Iran–Iraq War.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt;

According to the [[supreme leader of Iran]], [[Ali Khamenei]], "disabled war veterans are images of the war crimes of [[Great power|big powers]] who encouraged former Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]] to invade Iran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writers|title=Disabled war veterans are testimony to Iranian history: Leader|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=249538|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=Tehran Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writers|title=Leader praises disabled war veterans as testimony of Iranian history|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/News/127337.html|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=www.iran-daily.com|issue=Iran Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galilee Medical Center''' ({{lang-he-n|המרכז הרפואי לגליל}}, ''HaMerkaz HaRefu'i LaGalil''), abbreviated '''GMC''', is a [[hospital]] located in the coastal city of [[Nahariya]] and is the second largest hospital in northern Israel (after [[Rambam Hospital]] in [[Haifa]]). It was established in 1956.

The hospital located on the outskirts of Nahariya, three kilometers from the city center, serving half a million residents of the western Galilee, from [[Karmiel]] to the coast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3_wMCdhoAfgC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=nahariya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UTmaT9DtG9Or8AOo18CSDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=nahariya&amp;f=false Civilians Under Assault: Hezbollah's Rocket Attacks on Israel, Human Rights Watch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since its modest beginning as a small maternity hospital, The Galilee Medical Center has grown into a 722-bed facility. The [[emergency department]] receives about 400 people every day and the number of hospitalizations is about 60,000 a year. Approximately 420 physicians practice in this government owned hospital, while the total number of employees is about 2200. The hospital staff is a reflection of the multi-ethnic demography of the Western Galilee, consisting of Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze and others. In 2007, the Western Galilee Hospital was the first to appoint an Arab Israeli, Dr. Masad Barhoum, as its director.

Located in close proximity to Israel's northern border with Lebanon, the hospital's main area of expertise is trauma: IDF soldiers, Israeli civilians, UN personnel and civilians from neighboring Arab countries.

The '''history of malaria''' stretches from its prehistoric origin as a [[zoonotic]] disease in the primates of Africa through to the 21st century. A widespread and potentially lethal human infectious disease, at its peak [[malaria]] infested every continent, except [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carter R, Mendis KN | title =Evolutionary and historical aspects of the burden of malaria | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev| volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 564–94| year = 2002 | pmid = 12364370 | url = http://skishore.wikispaces.com/file/view/Evo-Historical+Aspects+of+Malaria.pdf | pmc=126857 | doi=10.1128/cmr.15.4.564-594.2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its prevention and treatment have been targeted in science and medicine for hundreds of years. Since the discovery of the [[parasite]]s which cause it, research attention has focused on their biology, as well as that of the [[mosquitoe]]s which transmit the parasites.

References to its unique, periodic fevers are found throughout recorded history beginning in the first millennium BCE in Greece and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Neghina R, Neghina AM, Marincu I, Iacobiciu I | title = Malaria, a Journey in Time: In Search of the Lost Myths and Forgotten Stories| journal = Am J Med Sci | issue =6| pages = 492–498| year =2010 | pmid = 20601857 | doi=10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3181e7fe6c | volume=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3044/ The Su Wen of the Huangdi Neijing (Inner Classic of the Yellow Emperor)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of years, traditional [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] have been used to treat malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Willcox ML, Bodeker G | title = Traditional herbal medicines for malaria | journal = BMJ| year = 2004 | volume = 329| pages = 1156–9| pmid =15539672| doi =10.1136/bmj.329.7475.1156| url = http://www.giftsofhealth.org/ritam/flyer/Willcox&amp;Bodeker2004.pdf | issue = 7475 | pmc = 527695 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of [[Cinchona|cinchona tree]], which contains [[quinine]]. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide [[Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane|DDT]], swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and [[artemisinin]]s, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =Economic outcomes of Malaria in South East Asia|publisher= „Opportunities for cooperation between Europe and Asia” |date= 2015|accessdate=5 August 2016|isbn=978-83-62753-58-1|location= Józefów|pages= 157–174|url= http://www.proeconomics.pl/artykuly/Malaria.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaria researchers have won multiple Nobel Prizes for their achievements, although the disease continues to afflict some 200 million patients each year, killing more than 600,000.

Malaria was the most important health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during [[World War II]], where about 500,000 men were infected.&lt;ref name="Bray 2004"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bray RS |title=Armies of Pestilence: The Effects of Pandemics on History |year=2004|publisher=James Clarke |isbn=978-0-227-17240-7 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djPWGnvBm08C&amp;pg=PA102}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, "Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns."&lt;ref name="Byrne 2008"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Byrne JP |title=Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A-M |year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-34102-1 |page=383 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&amp;pg=PA383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the 20th century, malaria remained endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including large areas of Central and South America, [[Hispaniola]] ([[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] species of the parasite have complicated control measures.

About 10,000 years ago, malaria started having a major impact on human survival, coinciding with the start of agriculture in the [[Neolithic revolution]]. Consequences included [[natural selection]] for [[sickle-cell disease]], [[thalassaemias]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], [[Southeast Asian ovalocytosis]], [[elliptocytosis]] and loss of the Gerbich antigen ([[glycophorin C]]) and the [[Duffy antigen system|Duffy antigen]] on the [[red blood cells|erythrocytes]], because such [[blood disorders]] confer a selective advantage against malaria infection ([[balancing selection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Canali S| title = Researches on thalassemia and malaria in Italy and the origins of the "Haldane hypothesis"| journal = Med Secoli| volume =20 | issue =3| pages = 827–46| year =2008 | pmid = 19848219 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38028954_Researches_on_thalassemia_and_malaria_in_Italy_and_the_origins_of_the_Haldane_hypothesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three major types of inherited [[Genetic resistance to malaria|genetic resistance]] (sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) were present in the [[Mediterranean]] world by the time of the [[Roman Empire]], about 2000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sallares R, Bouwman A, Anderung C | title = The Spread of Malaria to Southern Europe in Antiquity: New Approaches to Old Problems | journal = Med Hist| volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–28| year = 2004 | pmid = 16021928 | pmc=547919 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300007651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical period ==

Malaria became widely recognized in [[ancient Greece]] by the 4th century BCE, and is implicated in the decline of many [[city-state]] populations. The term ''μίασμα'' (Greek for [[Miasma theory|miasma]]): "stain, pollution", was coined by [[Hippocrates]] of [[Kos]] who used it to describe dangerous fumes from the ground that are transported by winds and can cause serious illnesses. [[Hippocrates]] (460–370 BCE), the "father of medicine", related the presence of intermittent [[fevers]] with [[Climate|climatic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] conditions and classified the fever according to periodicity: Gk.:''tritaios pyretos'' / L.:''febris tertiana'' (fever every third day), and Gk.:''tetartaios pyretos'' / L.:''febris quartana'' (fever every fourth day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Hippocrates| title = Of the epidemics | translator=Francis Adams |publisher=The Internet Classics Archive| url =http://classics.mit.edu//Hippocrates/epidemics.mb.txt }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pappas G, Kiriaze IJ, Falagas ME | title = Insights into infectious disease in the era of Hippocrates | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | year = 2008 | pmid = 18178502 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2007.11.003 | volume = 12 | pages = 347–50 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' (The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor) dating from ~300 BCE – 200 CE apparently refers to repeated paroxysmal fevers associated with enlarged [[spleens]] and a tendency to epidemic occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cox F | title = History of human parasitology | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 595–612 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12364371 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.15.4.595-612.2002 | pmc = 126866 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 168 BCE, the herbal remedy ''Qing-hao'' ([[:zh:青蒿素|青蒿]]) (''[[Artemisia annua]]'') came into use in China to treat female [[hemorrhoid]]s (''[[Wushi'er bingfang]]'' translated as "Recipes for 52 kinds of diseases" unearthed from the [[Mawangdui]]).&lt;ref name=Li&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li Y, Wu YL | title = An over four millennium story behind qinghaosu (artemisinin)--a fantastic antimalarial drug from a traditional Chinese herb| journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 10 | pages = 2197–230| year = 2003| pmid =14529339 | doi = 10.2174/0929867033456710 | issue = 21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Qing-hao'' was first recommended for acute intermittent fever episodes by [[Ge Hong]] as an effective medication in the 4th-century Chinese manuscript ''Zhou hou bei ji fang'', usually translated as "Emergency Prescriptions kept in one's Sleeve".&lt;ref name="Wright2010"/&gt; His recommendation was to soak fresh plants of the [[Artemisia (genus)|artemisia]] herb in cold water, wring it out and ingest the expressed bitter juice in its raw state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hsu E | title = Reflections on the 'discovery' of the antimalarial qinghao| journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology| volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 666–70 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16722826 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02673.x |pmc=1885105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li Y, Wu YL | title = How Chinese scientists discovered qinghaosu (artemisinin) and developed its derivatives?

'Roman fever' refers to a particularly deadly strain of [[malaria]] that affected the Roman Campagna and the city of Rome throughout various epochs in history. An epidemic of Roman fever during the fifth century AD may have contributed to the fall of the [[Roman empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Sallares R | title = Malaria and Rome: a history of malaria in ancient Italy| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2002 | isbn = 9780199248506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lalchhandama K |title=The making of modern malariology: from miasma to mosquito-malaria theory |journal=Science Vision |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=3–17 |year=2014 |url=http://www.sciencevision.org/current_issue/dl/Lalchhandama.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427025145/http://www.sciencevision.org/current_issue/dl/Lalchhandama.pdf |archivedate=27 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The many remedies to reduce the [[spleen]] in [[Pedanius Dioscorides]]'s ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' have been suggested to have been a response to chronic malaria in the Roman empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.ibidispress.scriptmania.com/box_widget.html | title=Dioscorides: De Materia Medica | publisher=Ibidis | author=Osbaldeston, Tess Anne | year=2000 | pages=Introduction, xxvi | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062658/http://www.ibidispress.scriptmania.com/box_widget.html | archivedate=24 September 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some so-called "[[vampire]] burials" in [[late antiquity]] may have been performed in response to malaria epidemics. For example, some children who died of malaria were buried in the [[necropolis]] at [[Lugnano in Teverina]] using rituals meant to prevent them from [[Undead|returning from the dead]]. Modern scholars hypothesize that communities feared that the dead would return and spread disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/10/15/archaeologists-find-vampire-burial-site-child-feared-capable-rising-dead|title=Archaeologists find ‘vampire burial’ site of a child feared capable of rising from the dead|last=Phillips|first=Kristine|date=2018-10-15|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 835, the celebration of [[Hallowmas]] (All Saints Day) was moved from May to November at the behest of [[Pope Gregory IV]], on the "practical grounds that Rome in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it", and perhaps because of [[public health]] considerations regarding Roman Fever, which claimed a number of lives of [[pilgrim]]s during the sultry summers of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Butler's Saint for the Day (Paul Burns), Liturgical Press, page 516&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle Ages ==

During the [[Middle Ages]], treatments for malaria (and other diseases) included blood-letting, inducing vomiting, limb amputations and [[trepanning]]. Physicians and surgeons in the period used herbal medicines like [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] to bring about pain relief in afflicted patients.&lt;ref name="medline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/531.html|title=Belladonna|date=2009-12-16|publisher=Medline Plus|accessdate=2010-11-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220172635/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/531.html| archivedate= 20 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ebadi, Manuchair|title=Pharmacodynamic Basis of Herbal Medicine|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=9780849370502|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMJKgfhCKzIC&amp;pg=PA203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===

The name malaria derived from ''mal aria'' ('bad air' in [[Italian language#History|Medieval Italian]]). This idea came from the Ancient Romans who thought that this disease came from the horrible fumes in the swamps. The word malaria has its roots in the [[miasma theory]], as described by historian and chancellor of Florence [[Leonardo Bruni]] in his ''Historiarum Florentini populi libri XII'', which was the first major example of Renaissance historical writing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hempelmann E, Krafts K | title = Bad air, amulets and mosquitoes: 2,000 years of changing perspectives on malaria | journal = Malar J. | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 213 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23835014 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-12-232| url = http://www.malariajournal.com/content/pdf/1475-2875-12-232.pdf | pmc=3723432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erano alcuni a' quali pareva sommamente utile e necessario a ridurre lo esercito, e massimamente essendo affaticato per la infermità e per la '''mala aria'''e per lungo e difficile campeggiare nel tempo dell'autunno e in luoghi infermi, e vedendo ancora ch'egli era diminuito assai per la licenza conceduta a molti pel capitano di potersi partire: perocchè, nel tempo che eglino erano stati lungamente a quello assedio, molti, o per disagio del campo o per paura d'infermità, avevano domandato e ottenuto licenza da lui (Acciajuoli 1476).

After the Florentines had conquered this stronghold, after putting good guardians on it they were discussing among themselves how to proceed. For some of them it appeared most useful and necessary to reduce the army, more so as it was extremely stressed by disease and '''bad air''', and due to the long-lasting and difficult camps in unhealthy places during the autumn. They (the Florentines) further considered that the army was reduced in numbers due to the leave permits granted to many soldiers by their officers. In fact, during the siege, many soldiers had asked and obtained leave permits due to the camp hardships and fear of illness [translated from medieval Italian, Toscanic dialect].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The coastal plains of [[southern Italy]] fell from international prominence when malaria expanded in the sixteenth century. At roughly the same time, in the coastal marshes of England, mortality from "marsh fever" or "tertian ague" (''ague'': via French from medieval Latin ''acuta'' (''febris''), acute fever) was comparable to that in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dobson MJ | title = Malaria in England: a geographical and historical perspective| journal = Parassitologia | volume = 36| pages = 35–60| year = 1994 | pmid = 7898959 | issue = 1–2}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal | author = Knottnerus O S | title = Malaria Around the North Sea: A Survey | journal = Gerold Wefer, Wolfgang H.

In the book ''[[1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created]]'', the author [[Charles C. Mann|Charles Mann]] cites sources that speculate that the reason African slaves were brought to the British Americas was because of their immunity to malaria. Britain did not have large numbers of African slaves, there were plenty of unemployed workers who could come as [[indentured servant]]s. In the area above the [[Mason–Dixon line]], the malaria protozoa did not fare well, the English-speaking indentured servant proved more profitable as he would work toward his freedom and hence worked with less supervision and coercion. As malaria spread, places such as the tidewater of Virginia and South Carolina which had previously been habitable by white people became endemic with malaria. Small white landholders were at a disadvantage to plantation owners, as they risk complete economic ruin when they were sick, while plantation owners relied on more malaria resistant West African slaves. Malaria caused huge losses to British forces in the South during the revolutionary war as well as to Union forces during the Civil War. Malaria also helped weaken the Native American population and make them more susceptible to other diseases.

=== Cinchona tree ===
Spanish [[missionaries]] found that fever was treated by [[Amerindians]] near Loxa ([[Peru]]) with powder from [[Jesuit's bark|Peruvian bark]] (later established to be from any of several trees of genus ''[[Cinchona]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Butler AR, Khan S, Ferguson E | title = A brief history of malaria chemotherapy| journal = J R Coll Physicians Edinb | volume = 40| issue = 2| pages = 172–7 | year = 2010| pmid = 20695174| url = http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_40_2/butler.pdf | doi = 10.4997/JRCPE.2010.216}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used by the [[Quechuas|Quechua]] Indians of Peru to reduce the shaking effects caused by severe chills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guerra F.| title = The introduction of Cinchona in the treatment of malaria | journal = J Trop Med Hyg.| volume = 80 |issue = 6| pages = 112–118; 135–140| year = 1977 | pmid = 330870}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesuit]] Brother Agostino Salumbrino (1561–1642), who lived in [[Lima]] and was an [[apothecary]] by training, observed the Quechua using the bark of the [[cinchona]] tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from cold, it was nevertheless effective for malaria. The use of the “fever tree” bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries ([[Jesuit's bark]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Greenwood D.| title = The quinine connection| journal = J Antimicrob Chemother | volume = 30| issue = 4 | pages =417–27 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1490916 | doi = 10.1093/jac/30.4.417}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaufman T, Rúveda E | title = The quest for quinine: those who won the battles and those who won the war | journal = Angew Chem Int Ed Engl | volume = 44 | issue = 6 | pages = 854–85 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15669029 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200400663}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesuit [[Bernabé Cobo|Bernabé de Cobo]] (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited with taking cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of [[Italy]], in 1632. [[Francesco Torti]] wrote in 1712 that only “intermittent fever” was amenable to the fever tree bark.&lt;ref&gt;Torti, F. "Therapeutice Specialis ad Febres Periodicas Perniciosas", 1712 Modena&lt;/ref&gt; This work finally established the specific nature of cinchona bark and brought about its general use in medicine.&lt;ref name=Chwatt&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bruce-Chwatt LJ |title=Three hundred and fifty years of the Peruvian fever bark |journal=British Medical Journal (Clinical Research Edition) |volume=296 |issue=6635 |pages=1486–7 |year=1988 |pmid=3134079 |pmc=2546010 |doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6635.1486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be nearly 200 years before the active principles, quinine and other [[alkaloid]]s, of cinchona bark were isolated. [[Quinine]], a toxic plant alkaloid, is, in addition to its anti-malarial properties, an effective muscle relaxant, as the modern use for nocturnal leg [[cramp]]s suggests (corroborating its use for shivering by the Peruvian Indians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guay DR| title = Are there alternatives to the use of quinine to treat nocturnal leg cramps?| journal = Consult Pharm | volume = 23 |issue = 2| pages =141–56 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18454580 | doi = 10.4140/TCP.n.2008.141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical indications ===
In 1717, the dark pigmentation of a postmortem [[spleen]] and brain was published by the epidemiologist [[Giovanni Maria Lancisi]] in his malaria text book ''De noxiis paludum effluviis eorumque remediis''. This was one of the earliest reports of the characteristic enlargement of the spleen and dark color of the spleen and brain which are the most constant post-mortem indications of chronic malaria infection. He related the prevalence of malaria in swampy areas to the presence of [[flies]] and recommended [[swamp]] [[drainage]] to prevent it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cook GC, Webb AJ | title = Perceptions of malaria transmission before Ross' discovery in 1897| journal = Postgrad Med J |volume= 76 |issue= 901|pages= 738–40|year= 2000 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1741788/pdf/v076p00738.pdf | doi=10.1136/pmj.76.901.738 | pmid=11060174 | pmc=1741788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th century ==
[[File:AL1887 pg190 Map Death from Malaria (US, 1880 Census).jpg|thumb|Map of the United States showing the distribution of deaths from malaria. Census of 1880.]]
In the nineteenth century, the first drugs were developed to treat malaria and parasites were first identified as its source.

=== Antimalarial drugs ===

==== Quinine ====

French chemist [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] and French pharmacist [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]] separated in 1820 the alkaloids cinchonine and quinine from powdered fever tree bark, allowing for the creation of standardized doses of the active ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier and Caventou (1820) [https://books.google.com/books?id=veE3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Suite: Des recherches chimiques sur les quinquinas"] (Continuation: Chemical research on quinquinas), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', vol. 15, pages 337–365. The authors name quinine on page 348: "..., nous avons cru devoir la nommer ''quinine'', pour la distinguer de la cinchonine par un nom qui indique également son origine." (..., we thought that we should name it "quinine" in order to distinguish it from cinchonine by means of a name that also indicates its origin.)&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyle RA, Shampe MA |title=Discoverers of quinine |journal=JAMA |volume=229 |issue=4 |pages=462 |year=1974 |pmid=4600403 |doi=10.1001/jama.229.4.462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1820, the bark was simply dried, ground to a fine powder and mixed into a liquid (commonly wine) for drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siegel RE, Poynter FN |title= Robert Talbor, Charles II, and cinchona: a contemporary document|journal=Med Hist |volume=6 |issue=1|pages=82–5|year=1962 |pmid=16562233 |pmc=1034677 |doi=10.1017/s0025727300026892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An English trader, [[Charles Ledger]], and his [[Amerindian]] servant spent four years collecting cinchona seeds in the Andes in [[Bolivia]], highly prized for their quinine but whose export was prohibited. Ledger managed to get seeds out; in 1865, the Dutch government cultivated 20,000 trees of the ''[[Cinchona ledgeriana]]'' in Java (Indonesia). By the end of the nineteenth century, the Dutch had established a world monopoly over its supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gramiccia G|title= Ledger's cinchona seeds: a composite of field experience, chance, and intuition|journal= Parassitologia |volume= 29 |issue= 2–3|pages= 207–20|year= 1987 |pmid=3334083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 'Warburg's Tincture' ====

In 1834, in [[British Guiana]], a German physician, [[Carl Warburg]], invented an [[antipyretic]] medicine: '[[Warburg's Tincture]]'. This secret, proprietary remedy contained quinine and other [[Herbalism|herbs]]. Trials were made in Europe in the 1840s and 1850s. It was officially adopted by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1847. It was considered by many eminent medical professionals to be a more efficacious [[antimalarial]] than quinine. It was also more economical. The British Government supplied Warburg's Tincture to troops in [[India]] and other colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Maclean WC |title= Professor Maclean, C.B., on the true composition and therapeutic value of Warburg's Tincture |journal=Lancet |volume=106|pages=716–718 |year=1875|doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(02)30835-3 |issue= 2724}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Poser CM, Bruyn GW |title= An Illustrated History of Malaria | page= 87|location=New York|year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4fyLSwLP3MC |publisher= Informa Health Care |isbn= 978-1-85070-068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methylene blue ====

In 1876, [[methylene blue]] was synthesized by German chemist [[Heinrich Caro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krafts K, Hempelmann E, Oleksyn BJ |title=In search of the malarial parasite : Biographical sketches of the blood stain contributors|journal= Parasitol Research |volume= 109 |pages=521–529|year=2011|pmid=21660627 |doi=10.1007/s00436-011-2475-4 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Ehrlich]] in 1880 described the use of "neutral" dyes – mixtures of [[acid]]ic and [[base (chemistry)|basic]] [[dye]]s for the differentiation of cells in peripheral blood smears.

This new method differentiated [[blood cell]]s and demonstrated the nuclei of malarial parasites. Malachowski's staining technique was one of the most significant technical advances in the history of malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krafts KP, Hempelmann E, Oleksyn B |title=The color purple: from royalty to laboratory, with apologies to Malachowski |journal= Biotech Histochem |volume=86 |pages=7–35|year=2011 |pmid= 21235291| doi = 10.3109/10520295.2010.515490 |issue=1|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49755721_The_color_purple_from_royalty_to_laboratory_with_apologies_to_Malachowski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, [[Paul Guttmann]] and Ehrlich noted that methylene blue had a high affinity for some tissues and that this dye had a slight antimalarial property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guttmann P, Ehrlich P |title= Ueber die Wirkung des Methylenblau bei Malaria|journal= Berliner Klinische Wochenschrift |volume= 28 |pages= 953–956|year= 1891|url =http://www.pei.de/cln_092/nn_164284/SharedDocs/Downloads/institut/paul-ehrlich/1886-1896/1891-wirkung-methylenblau-malaria,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/1891-wirkung-methylenblau-malaria.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Methylene blue and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] may act by preventing the [[biocrystallization]] of [[heme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wainwright M, Amaral L |title= The phenothiazinium chromophore and the evolution of antimalarial drugs|journal= Trop Med Int Health|volume= 10|issue=6 |pages=501–11|year= 2005 |pmid=15941412 |url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118667658/PDFSTART |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2005.01417.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laveran malaria drawings.png|thumb| In 1880, [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]] observed pigmented parasites and the exflagellation of male gametocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laveran CLA |title=Note sur un nouveau parasite trouvé dans le sang de plusieurs malades atteints de fièvre palustres |journal=Bull Acad Med |volume=9 |pages=1235–1236 |year=1880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Cause: Identification of Plasmodium and Anopheles ===

In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lorber CG, Lorber CP, Schneider J |title=Die Medizinerfamilie Meckel aus Wetzlar |journal=Hess Aerzteblatt |volume=2 |pages=95–99 |year=2005 |url=http://www.laekh.de/upload/Hess._Aerzteblatt/2005/2005_02/2005_02_08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719054014/http://www.laekh.de/upload/Hess._Aerzteblatt/2005/2005_02/2005_02_08.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded [[hemozoin|black-brown pigment granules]] in the blood and [[spleen]] of a patient who had died in a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria [[parasitism|parasites]] without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was [[melanin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meckel H.|title= Ueber schwarzes Pigment in der Milz und dem Blute einer Geisteskranken|journal= Zeitschrift für Psychiatrie |volume= IV |pages= 198–226 |year= 1847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The causal relationship of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]], working in the military hospital of [[Constantine, Algeria]], observed pigmented parasites inside the [[red blood cell]]s of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving [[Flagellum|flagella]] were [[parasitic]] [[microorganisms]]. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism ''Oscillaria malariae'' and proposed that malaria was caused by this [[protozoa]]n.&lt;ref name=Cox &gt;{{cite journal | author = Cox FE | title = History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors | journal = Parasites &amp; Vectors | volume = 3 | pages = 5 | year = 2010 |doi = 10.1186/1756-3305-3-5 |url = http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/pdf/1756-3305-3-5.pdf | pmid = 20205846 | issue = 1 | pmc = 2825508}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.

In 1885, [[Ettore Marchiafava]], [[Angelo Celli]] and [[Camillo Golgi]] studied the reproduction cycles in human blood (Golgi cycles). Golgi observed that all parasites present in the blood divided almost simultaneously at regular intervals and that division coincided with attacks of fever. In 1886 Golgi described the morphological differences that are still used to distinguish two malaria parasite species ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' and ''[[Plasmodium malariae]]''. Shortly after this Sakharov in 1889 and Marchiafava &amp; Celli in 1890 independently identified ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' as a species distinct from ''P. vivax'' and ''P. malariae''. In 1890, Grassi and Feletti reviewed the available information and named both ''P. malariae'' and ''P. vivax'' (although within the genus ''[[Haemamoeba]]''.)&lt;ref name=Grassi1890&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassi |first1=B |last2=Feletti |first2=R |year=1890 |title=Parasites malariques chez les oiseaux. |journal=Arch. Ital. Biol. |volume=13 |pages=297–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, Laveran's germ was generally accepted, but most of his initial ideas had been discarded in favor of the taxonomic work and clinical [[pathology]] of the Italian school. Marchiafava and Celli called the new microorganism ''[[Plasmodium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith DC, Sanford LB |title= Laveran's germ: the reception and use of a medical discovery|journal= Am J Trop Med Hyg|volume= 34 |issue= 1|pages=2–20 |year= 1985 |pmid= 2578751}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''H. vivax'' was soon renamed ''Plasmodium vivax''. In 1892, Marchiafava and Bignami proved that the multiple forms seen by Laveran were from a single species. This species was eventually named ''P. falciparum''. Laveran was awarded the 1907 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] "in recognition of his work on the role played by protozoa in causing diseases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Biography of Alphonse Laveran | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1907/laveran-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch physician [[Pieter Klazes Pel|Pieter Pel]] first proposed a tissue stage of the malaria parasite in 1886, presaging its discovery by over 50 years. This suggestion was reiterated in 1893 when Golgi suggested that the parasites might have an undiscovered tissue phase (this time in endothelial cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Golgi C |title= Sulle febbri malariche estivo-autumnali di Roma|journal= Gass Med di Pavia |volume= 2 |pages=481–493, 505–520, 529–544, 553–559 |year= 1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pel in 1896 supported Golgi's latent phase theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pel PK |title= Mededeelingen uit de Geneeskundige kliniek.

An early effort at malaria prevention occurred in 1896 in Massachusetts. An [[Uxbridge, MA|Uxbridge]] outbreak prompted health officer [[Leonard White (physician)|Dr. Leonard White]] to write a report to the State Board of Health, which led to a study of mosquito-malaria links and the first efforts for malaria prevention. Massachusetts state pathologist, Theobald Smith, asked that White's son collect mosquito specimens for further analysis, and that citizens add [[Window screen|screens]] to windows, and [[Drainage|drain]] collections of water.&lt;ref name="malaria"&gt;{{cite web |title=A History of Mosquitoes in Massachusetts, by Curtis R.

Britain's [[Ronald Ross|Sir Ronald Ross]], an army surgeon working in [[Secunderabad]] [[India]], proved in 1897 that [[Mosquito-malaria theory|malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes]], an event now commemorated via [[World Mosquito Day]].&lt;ref name="dfid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/world-mosquito-day/ |title=World Mosquito Day 2010 |publisher=Department for International Development |date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=21 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CLT7rY2B?url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/latest-news/2010/world-mosquito-day/ |archivedate=21 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to find pigmented malaria parasites in a mosquito that he artificially fed on a malaria patient who had crescents in his blood. He continued his research into malaria by showing that certain mosquito species (''[[Culex]] fatigans'') transmit malaria to [[sparrows]] and he isolated malaria parasites from the [[salivary glands]] of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Biography of Ronald Ross | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1902/ross-bio.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported this to the [[British Medical Association]] in Edinburgh in 1898.

[[Giovanni Battista Grassi]], professor of [[Comparative Anatomy]] at Rome University, showed that human malaria could only be transmitted by ''[[Anopheles]]'' (Greek ''anofelís'': good-for-nothing) mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Capanna E |title= Grassi versus Ross: who solved the riddle of malaria? | journal= International Microbiology |volume= 9 |issue= 1 |pages= 69–74|year= 2006|pmid=16636993 |url = http://www.im.microbios.org/0901/0901069.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassi along with coworkers [[Amico Bignami]], [[Giuseppe Bastianelli]] and Ettore Marchiafava announced at the session of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] on 4 December 1898 that a healthy man in a non-malarial zone had contracted tertian malaria after being bitten by an experimentally infected ''Anopheles claviger'' specimen.

In 1898–1899, Bastianelli, Bignami and Grassi were the first to observe the complete transmission cycle of ''P. falciparum'', ''P. vivax'' and ''P. malaria'' from mosquito to human and back in ''A. claviger''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Grassi B, Bignami A, Bastianelli G |title=Ulteriore ricerche sul ciclo dei parassiti malarici umani sul corpo del zanzarone|journal= Accad Lincei|year=1899|issue=8|pages=21–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dispute broke out between the British and Italian schools of malariology over priority, but Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for "his work on malaria, by which he has shown how it enters the organism and thereby has laid the foundation for successful research on this disease and methods of combating it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ross and the Discovery that Mosquitoes Transmit Malaria Parasites| work = CDC Malaria website | url = https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/ross.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070602185153/http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/ross.htm |archivedate = 2 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthesis of quinine ===

[[William Henry Perkin]], a student of [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] at the [[Royal College of Chemistry]] in London, unsuccessfully tried in the 1850s to synthesize quinine in a commercial process. The idea was to take two equivalents of N-allyltoluidine ({{chem|C|10|H || 13|N}}) and three atoms of oxygen to produce quinine ({{chem|C|20|H|24|N|2|O|2}}) and water. Instead, [[Perkin's mauve]] was produced when attempting [[quinine total synthesis]] via the oxidation of N-allyltoluidine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Seeman JI|title= The Woodward-Doering/Rabe-Kindler total synthesis of quinine: setting the record straight|journal= Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume= 46 |issue= 9 |pages=1378–413 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17294412 |doi= 10.1002/anie.200601551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Perkin's discovery, all [[dye]]s and pigments were derived from roots, leaves, insects, or, in the case of [[Tyrian purple]], [[Mollusca|molluscs]].

Quinine wouldn't be successfully synthesized until 1918. Synthesis remains elaborate, expensive and low yield, with the additional problem of separation of the stereoisomers. Though quinine is not one of the major drugs used in treatment, modern production still relies on extraction from the cinchona tree.

=== Etiology: Plasmodium tissue stage and reproduction ===

Relapses were first noted in 1897 by William S. Thayer, who recounted the experiences of a physician who relapsed 21 months after leaving an endemic area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Thayer W. |title=Lectures on the malarial fevers |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Woqcfoq5dwoC | publisher=D.Appleton &amp; Co., New York|year= 1898 |isbn= 978-0-543-91236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the existence of a tissue stage. Relapses were confirmed by Patrick Manson, who allowed infected ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes to feed on his eldest son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Manson P | title =Experimental proof of the mosquito-malaria theory. 1900 | journal = Originally published in Br Med J 1900;2:949–951; reprint in: Yale J Biol Med |volume = 75 | pages = 107–12 | year = 2002 | pmc=2588736 | pmid = 12230309 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Manson then described a relapse nine months after his apparent cure with quinine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Manson PT | title =Experimental Malaria: Recurrence after Nine Months | journal = Br Med J |volume = 2| pages = 77 | year = 1901 | pmc=2505910 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.2115.77 | pmid=20759742 | issue = 2115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in 1900 Amico Bignami and Giuseppe Bastianelli found that they could not infect an individual with blood containing only gametocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bignami A, Bastianelli G |title =Sulla inoculazione delle sangue di semiluna malariche d'uomo | journal = Atti Soc Studi Malar |volume = 1| pages = 15–20 | year = 1900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of the existence of a chronic blood stage infection was proposed by Ronald Ross and David Thompson in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross R, Thompson D | title =Some enumeration studies on malarial fever | url=https://archive.org/stream/philtrans04341040/04341040_djvu.txt |journal = Ann Trop Med Parasitol |volume = 4| pages = 267–306 | year = 1910 | bibcode =1910RSPSB..83..159R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of asexually-reproducing avian malaria parasites in cells of the internal organs was first demonstrated by Henrique de Beaurepaire Aragão in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=James SP, Tate P | title = Exo-erythrocytic schizogony in Plasmodium gallinaceum Brumpt, 1935 | journal = Parasitology |volume = 30| pages = 128–138| year = 1938 | doi =10.1017/S0031182000010891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three possible mechanisms of relapse were proposed by [[Émile Marchoux|Marchoux]] in 1926 (&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;) [[parthenogenesis]] of macro[[gametocyte]]s: (&lt;code&gt;ii&lt;/code&gt;) persistence of [[schizont]]s in small numbers in the blood where immunity inhibits multiplication, but later disappears and/or (&lt;code&gt;iii&lt;/code&gt;) reactivation of an encysted body in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marchoux E | title =Paludisme| journal = J. B. Bailliere, Paris. | year = 1926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James in 1931 proposed that sporozoites are carried to internal organs, where they enter [[reticuloendothelial]] cells and undergo a cycle of development, based on quinine's lack of activity on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = James SP | title =The use of plasmoquine in the prevention of malarial infections | journal = Proc R Acad Sci Amst |volume = 34| pages = 1424–1425 | year = 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huff and Bloom in 1935 demonstrated stages of avian malaria that transpire outside blood cells (exoerythrocytic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huff CG, Bloom W | title =A Malarial Parasite Infecting All Blood and Blood-Forming Cells of Birds | journal = J Infect Dis |volume = 57| pages = 315–336 | year = 1935 | issue = 3 | publisher = The Journal of Infectious Diseases, Vol. 57, No. 3 | jstor = 30088998 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/57.3.315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 Fairley ''et al.'' reported that inoculation of blood from a patient with ''P. vivax'' may fail to induce malaria, although the donor may subsequently exhibit the condition.

=== Malariotherapy ===
{{see also|Pyrotherapy|Helminthic therapy}}

In the early twentieth century, before [[antibiotics]], patients with tertiary [[syphilis]] were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, [[Julius Wagner-Jauregg]], a Viennese [[psychiatrist]], began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | author = Vogel G | title = Malaria as a Lifesaving Therapy | volume = 342 | page = 686 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24202157 | doi=10.1126/science.342.6159.686 | issue=6159| bibcode = 2013Sci...342..686V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (''Spirochaeta pallida'' also known as ''[[Treponema pallidum]]''). ''P. vivax'' infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wagner-Jauregg J. | title = Verhütung und Behandlung der Progressiven Paralyse durch Impfmalaria | journal = Handbuch der experimentellen Therapie, Ergänzungsband München | year = 1931 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of [[chemotherapeutic]] research and was practised until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frankenburg FR, Baldessarini RJ | title = Neurosyphilis, malaria, and the discovery of antipsychotic agents| journal = Harv Rev Psychiatry. | volume = 16 | issue =5 | pages = 299–307| year = 2008 | pmid =18803105 | doi = 10.1080/10673220802432350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation in the treatment of [[dementia paralytica]].&lt;ref name="nobel-1927"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1927/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1927 | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panama Canal and vector control ===
{{main|Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal}}

In 1881, Dr. [[Carlos Finlay]], a Cuban-born physician of Scottish ancestry, theorized that [[yellow fever]] was transmitted by a specific mosquito, later designated ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Finlay CJ.|title=El mosquito hipotéticamente considerado como agent de transmision de la fiebre amarilla|journal=Anales de la Real Academia de Ciencias Médicas Físicas y Naturales de la Habana|date=1881|issue=18|pages=147–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory remained controversial for twenty years until confirmed in 1901 by [[Walter Reed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reed W, Carroll J, Agramonte A |title= The Etiology of Yellow Fever|journal= JAMA|volume= 36|issue= 7|pages= 431–440 |year= 1901|doi=10.1001/jama.1901.52470070017001f}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted exclusively by an insect vector, and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or eradication of its insect vector.

Yellow fever and malaria among workers had seriously delayed construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. Mosquito control instituted by [[William C.

==== Artemisinins ====
Systematic screening of traditional Chinese medical herbs was carried out by Chinese research teams, consisting of hundreds of scientists in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li Y, Wu Y | title = A golden phoenix arising from the herbal nest – A review and reflection on the study of antimalarial drug Qinghaosu | journal = Frontiers of Chemistry in China | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 357–422 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s11458-010-0214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qinghaosu, later named [[artemisinin]], was cold-extracted in a neutral milieu (pH 7.0) from the dried leaves of ''[[Artemisia annua]]''.&lt;ref name="Wright2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright CW, Linley PA, Brun R, Wittlin S, Hsu E | title = Ancient Chinese methods are remarkably effective for the preparation of artemisinin-rich extracts of qing hao with potent antimalarial activity | journal = Molecules| volume = 15 | pages = 804–12| year = 2010 |pmid =20335947 |url = http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/15/2/804/pdf | doi = 10.3390/molecules15020804 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liao F| title = Discovery of Artemisinin (Qinghaosu) | journal = Molecules| volume = 14 | pages = 5362–5366| year = 2009 | doi =10.3390/molecules14125362 |url = http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/14/12/5362/pdf | issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artemisinin was isolated by pharmacologist [[Tu Youyou]] ([[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], 2015). Tu headed a team tasked by the Chinese government with finding a treatment for choloroquine-resistant malaria. Their work was known as [[Project 523]], named after the date it was announced – 23 May 1967. The team investigated more than 2000  Chinese herb preparations and by 1971 had made 380 extracts from 200 herbs. An extract from qinghao (''[[Artemisia annua]]'') was effective but the results were variable. Tu reviewed the literature, including ''Zhou hou bei ji fang'' (A handbook of prescriptions for emergencies) written in 340 BC by Chinese physician Ge Hong. This book contained the only useful reference to the herb: "A handful of qinghao immersed with two litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all." Tu's team subsequently isolated a nontoxic, neutral extract that was 100% effective against parasitemia in animals. The first successful trials of artemisinin were in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller LH, Su X | title = Artemisinin: Discovery from the Chinese Herbal Garden| journal = Cell | volume = 146 | issue = 6 | pages = 855–858 | year = 2011 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.024 | pmc=3414217 | pmid=21907397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Artemisia annua West Virginia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Artemisia annua]]'' being grown as a field crop in [[West Virginia]] for the production of artemisinin, 2005]]

Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene [[lactone]] containing a [[peroxide]] group, which is believed to be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, [[artesunate]] and [[artemether]], have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of ''[[Plasmodium berghei|P. berghei]]'' and ''P. cynomolgi'' and have transmission-blocking activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chotivanich K, Sattabongkot J, Udomsangpetch R, Looareesuwan S, Day NP, Coleman RE, White NJ | title = Transmission-Blocking Activities of Quinine, Primaquine, and Artesunate| journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother| volume = 50| issue = 6| pages = 1927–30| year = 2006| pmid = 16723547| doi =10.1128/AAC.01472-05 | pmc = 1479118}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, [[Zhou Yiqing]] and his team combined artemether and [[lumefantrine]] into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as [[Artemether/lumefantrine|“Coartem”]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weiyuan C| title = Ancient Chinese anti-fever cure becomes panacea for malaria| journal =Bull World Health Organ| volume = 87| issue = 10| pages = 743–4| year = 2009| pmid = 19876540| pmc=2755319| doi = 10.2471/BLT.09.051009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated ''falciparum'' malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nosten F, White NJ | title = Artemisinin-based combination treatment of falciparum malaria| journal = Am J Trop Med Hyg | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 181–92 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18165491| url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/77/6_Suppl/181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insecticides ===

Efforts to control the spread of malaria suffered a major setback in 1930: [[Entomology|entomologist]] [[Raymond Corbett Shannon]] discovered imported disease-bearing ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' mosquitoes living in [[Brazil]] (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be ''A. arabiensis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mosquito: The Story of Man's Deadliest foe | year=2002 | publisher=Hyperion | page=131 | first1=Andrew | last1=Spielman | first2=Michael | last2=D'Antonio | isbn=978-0-7868-8667-8|postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This species of mosquito is a particularly efficient vector for malaria and is native to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parmakelis A, Russello MA, Caccone A, Marcondes CB, Costa J, Forattini OP, Sallum MA, Wilkerson RC, Powell JR |title=Historical analysis of a near disaster: Anopheles gambiae in Brazil |journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=176–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18187802 |url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/78/1/176}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest epidemic of malaria ever seen in the [[New World]]. However, complete eradication of ''A. gambiae'' from northeast Brazil and thus from the New World was achieved in 1940 by the systematic application of the [[arsenic]]-containing compound [[Paris green]] to breeding places, and of [[pyrethrum]] spray-killing to adult resting places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Russell PF, West LS, Manwell RD, MacDonald G | title = Practical Malariology 2nd ed | publisher = Oxford University Press, London, New York, Toronto| year = 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== DDT ====

Austrian chemist [[Othmar Zeidler]] is credited with the first synthesis of [[DDT]] ('''D'''ichloro'''D'''iphenyl'''T'''richloroethane) in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zeidler O| title = Verbindungen von Chloral mit Brom- und Chlorbenzol| journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 1180–1181 | year = 1874 |doi = 10.1002/cber.18740070278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The insecticidal properties of DDT were identified in 1939 by chemist [[Paul Hermann Müller]] of [[Novartis|Geigy Pharmaceutical]]. For his discovery of DDT as a contact [[poison]] against several [[arthropod]]s, he was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.&lt;ref name="nobel-1948"&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/index.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1948 | accessdate = 2007-07-28 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1942, samples of the chemical were acquired by the United States, Britain and Germany. Laboratory tests demonstrated that it was highly effective against many insects.

[[Rockefeller Foundation]] studies showed in [[Mexico]] that DDT remained effective for six to eight weeks if sprayed on the inside walls and ceilings of houses and other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = The Rockefeller Foundation| title = Annual Report | year = 1944 |url = http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/uploads/files/d336704a-253d-45da-8572-5c98bcd65801-1944.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first field test in which residual DDT was applied to the interior surfaces of all habitations and outbuildings was carried out in central [[Italy]] in the spring of 1944. The objective was to determine the residual effect of the spray upon ''Anopheline'' density in the absence of other control measures. Spraying began in [[Castel Volturno]] and, after a few months, in the delta of the [[Tiber]]. The unprecedented effectiveness of the chemical was confirmed: the new [[insecticide]] was able to eradicate malaria by eradicating mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soper FL, Knipe FW, Casini G, Riehl LA, Rubino A | title = Reduction of Anopheles Density Effected by the Preseason Spraying of Building Interiors with DDT in Kerosene, at Castel Volturno, Italy, in 1944–1945 and in the Tiber Delta in 1945 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 177–200 | year = 1947 | pmid = 20292226 | journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of World War II, a massive malaria control program based on DDT spraying was carried out in Italy. In [[Sardinia]] – the second largest island in the Mediterranean – between 1946 and 1951, the Rockefeller Foundation conducted a large-scale experiment to test the feasibility of the strategy of "species eradication" in an endemic malaria vector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tognotti E| title = Program to Eradicate Malaria in Sardinia, 1946–1950| journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages = 1460–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19788815 |url = https://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/9/pdfs/08-1317.pdf | pmc = 2819864 | doi = 10.3201/eid1509.081317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria was effectively eliminated in the United States by the use of DDT in the [[National Malaria Eradication Program]] (1947–52). The concept of eradication prevailed in 1955 in the Eighth [[World Health Assembly]]: DDT was adopted as a primary tool in the fight against malaria.

In 1953, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) launched an antimalarial program in parts of Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication in tropical Africa. However, these projects encountered difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from malaria eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Webb James L. A. | year = 2011 | title = The First Large-Scale Use of Synthetic Insecticide for Malaria Control in Tropical Africa: Lessons from Liberia, 1945–1962 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_medicine_and_allied_sciences/v066/66.3.webb.html | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine &amp; Allied Sciences | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 347–376 | doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrq046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT was banned in the US in 1972, after the discussion opened in 1962 by ''[[Silent Spring]]'', written by American biologist [[Rachel Carson]], which launched the [[Environmental science|environmental]] movement in the West. The book catalogued the environmental impacts of indiscriminate DDT spraying and suggested that DDT and other [[pesticide]]s cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to [[wildlife]]. The [[United States Agency for International Development|U.S. Agency for International Development]] supports [[Indoor residual spraying|indoor DDT spraying]] as a vital component of malaria control programs and has initiated DDT and other insecticide spraying programs in tropical countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sadasivaiah S, Tozan Y, Breman JG | title = Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for indoor residual spraying in Africa: how can it be used for malaria control? | journal = American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 249–63 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18165500 |url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/abstract/77/6_Suppl/249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pyrethrum ====

Other [[insecticide]]s are available for mosquito control, as well as physical measures, such as draining the [[wetland]] breeding grounds and the provision of better [[sanitation]]. [[Pyrethrum]] (from the flowering plant ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'' [or ''[[Tanacetum]]''] ''cinerariaefolium'') is an economically important source of natural insecticide. [[Pyrethrin]]s attack the [[nervous system]]s of all insects. A few minutes after application, the insect cannot move or fly, while female mosquitoes are inhibited from biting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duchon S, Bonnet J, Marcombe S, Zaim M, Corbel V | title = Pyrethrum: a mixture of natural pyrethrins has potential for malaria vector control | journal = Journal of Medical Entomology | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 516–22 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19496422 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/033.046.0316 | doi = 10.1603/033.046.0316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of pyrethrum in insecticide preparations dates to about 400 [[Common Era|BCE]]. Pyrethrins are [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] and break down easily on exposure to light. The majority of the world's supply of pyrethrin and ''Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium'' comes from [[Kenya]]. The flower was first introduced into Kenya and the highlands of [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]] during the late 1920s. The flowers of the plant are harvested shortly after blooming; they are either dried and powdered, or the oils within the flowers are extracted with [[solvent]]s.

=== Research ===

==== Avian, mouse and monkey models ====
Until the 1950s, screening of anti-malarial drugs was carried out on avian malaria. Avian malaria species differ from those that infect humans. The discovery in 1948 of ''[[Plasmodium berghei]]'' in wild rodents in the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vincke IH, Lips M |title= Un nouveau plasmodium d'un rongeur sauvage du Congo: ''Plasmodium berghei'' n.sp |journal= Annales de la Société Belge de Médecine Tropicale |volume= 28 |pages= 97–104|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later other rodent species that could infect laboratory rats transformed drug development. The short hepatic phase and life cycle of these parasites made them useful as animal models, a status they still retain.&lt;ref name="Cox " /&gt; ''Plasmodium cynomolgi'' in rhesus monkeys (''[[Macaca mulatta]]'') were used in the 1960s to test drugs active against ''P. vivax''.

Growth of the liver stages in animal-free systems was achieved in the 1980s when pre-erythrocytic ''P. berghei'' stages were grown in wI38, a human [[embryonic cell|embryonic lung cell]] line (cells cultured from one specimen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Influence of Cell Type and Culture Medium on the In vitro Cultivation of Exoerythrocytic Stages of Plasmodium berghei |first1=Michael R. |last1=Hollingdale |first2=Pamela |last2=Leland |first3=James L. |last3=Leef |first4=Richard L. |last4=Beaudoin |journal=The Journal of Parasitology |volume= 69 |issue= 2 |date=April 1983 |pages= 346–352 |doi=10.2307/3281232 |jstor=3281232}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by their growth in human hepatoma line HepG2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 2489396| year = 1989| author1 = Davies| first1 = C.

S.| last3 = Winger| first3 = L. A.| last4 = Sinden| first4 = R. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''P. falciparum'' and ''P. vivax'' have been grown in human liver cells; partial development of ''P. ovale'' in human liver cells was achieved; and ''P. malariae'' was grown in chimpanzee and ''[[Night monkey|monkey]]'' liver cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1128/CMR.15.3.355-364.2002| pmid = 12097244| title = Cultivation of ''Plasmodium'' spp.| journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews| volume = 15| issue = 3| pages = 355–64| year = 2002| last1 = Schuster | first1 = F. L.| pmc = 118084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful continuous [[malaria culture]] was established in 1976 by William Trager and James B. Jensen, which facilitated research into the molecular biology of the parasite and the development of new drugs. By using increasing volumes of culture medium, ''P.falciparum'' was grown to higher [[parasitemia]] levels (above 10%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trager W, Jensen JB | title = Human malaria parasites in continuous culture| journal = Science| volume = 193 | issue = 4254 | pages = 673–5 | year = 1976 | pmid = 781840| doi=10.1126/science.781840| bibcode = 1976Sci...193..673T}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schuster FL | title = Cultivation of Plasmodium spp | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev| volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–64 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12097244 | url = http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/355 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.15.3.355-364.2002 | pmc = 118084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diagnostics ====

The use of antigen-based [[Malaria antigen detection tests|malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)]] emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ling IT, Cooksley S, Bates PA, Hempelmann E, Wilson RJ | title=Antibodies to the glutamate dehydrogenase of Plasmodium falciparum| journal=Parasitology | year=1986 | volume=92 | pages=313–24 | pmid=3086819 | doi=10.1017/S0031182000064088 | issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twenty-first century [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]] [[microscopy]] and RDTs became the two preferred [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] techniques. Malaria RDTs do not require special equipment and offer the potential to extend accurate malaria diagnosis to areas lacking microscopy services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Makler MT, Piper RC | title=Rapid malaria tests: where do we go after 20 years?| journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg| year=2009| volume=81 | pages=921–6 | pmid=19996417|url = http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/6/921 | doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2009.09-0202 | issue=6 }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bisoffi Z, Gobbi F, Angheben A, Van den Ende J | title=The Role of Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Managing Malaria| journal=PLOS Medicine| year=2009| volume=6 | pages=e1000063 | pmid=19399160|url =http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000063 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000063 | issue=4 | pmc=2667642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A zoonotic malarial parasite ===

''Plasmodium knowlesi'' has been known since the 1930s in Asian [[macaque]] monkeys and as experimentally capable of infecting humans. In 1965 a natural human infection was reported in a U.S. soldier returning from the Pahang Jungle of the [[Malaysia]]n peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Antinori S, Galimberti L, Milazzo L, Corbellino M | title=Plasmodium knowlesi: The emerging zoonotic malaria parasite |journal=Acta Tropica|year=2013|volume=125|pages=191–201|url = http://www.malarianexus.com/_common/updateable/files/articles/634941176681754741.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Huntington's disease Outreach Project for Education at Stanford''' ('''HOPES''') is a student-run project at [[Stanford University]] dedicated to making scientific information about [[Huntington's disease]] (HD) more readily accessible to patients and the public. Initiated by Professor William H. Durham in 2000, HOPES is a team of faculty members and undergraduate students at Stanford that surveys the rapidly growing scientific and clinical literature on Huntington's disease. They then present this information in a web resource that reflects the current scientific understanding of HD.

The HOPES website&lt;ref&gt;[http://hopes.stanford.edu HOPES website]&lt;/ref&gt; provides information about topics including the causes and symptoms of HD, existing drugs and supplements that may help HD patients, recent advances in HD research and lifestyle choices for managing HD. Articles summarize and synthesize recent research on HD for a non-technical audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdsa.org/research/links.html "Sources of Research Information"] Huntington's Disease Society of America, 2008 &lt;!--accessed July 4, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The website is designed for people of all ages and scientific backgrounds. Material ranges from interactive articles about basic genetics, written for children, to more comprehensive topics in [[molecular neuroscience]], such as the potential for [[stem cell]]s to treat or cure HD.

==Awards==
In June 2008 HOPES was honored with the first annual “Giving a Voice to HD” award from the [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]] (HDSA), which recognizes an individual or group who has helped to raise awareness about HD in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Marsha. [http://www.hdac.org/features/article.php?p_articleNumber=579 "The 2008 HDSA Convention"] Huntington’s Disease Advocacy Center, June 2008 &lt;!--accessed July 4, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In October 2018, HOPES was honored with the Community Advocate Award at the 12th Annual San Francisco Team Hope Walk

==History and structure==

interACT was founded in 2006 in [[Cotati, California]].&lt;ref name="found"&gt;{{cite web|title = AIC's Mission|url = http://aiclegal.org/who-we-are/mission/|accessdate = 22 May 2013|website = aiclegal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Resolve: Healing the Legacy of Intersex/DSD Treatment|url = https://www.changemakers.com/empower-patient/entries/resolve-healing-legacy-intersexdsd-treatment|website = [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public]] |date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is now based in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]].

==Advocacy==

interACT uses innovative strategies to advocate for the legal and human rights of children born with intersex traits, including media work and the development of youth leadership, in addition to strategic litigation. Issues of focus are [[informed consent]], [[insurance]], identity documents, school accommodation, discrimination, medical records retrieval, adoption, military service, [[medical privacy]], refugee asylum, and wider international human rights.&lt;ref name=WhatWeDo&gt;{{cite web|title=AIC: What we do|url=http://aiclegal.org/what-we-do/in-the-community|accessdate= May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torture"&gt;{{cite press release |last=Tamar-Mattis |first=Anne |title=Report to the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture: Medical Treatment of People with Intersex Conditions as Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment |trans-title=|language= |date=December 10, 2012 |publisher=AIC |location= |url=http://aiclegal.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AIC-Testimony-to-the-United-Nations-Special-Rapporteur-on-Torture_December-2012.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=May 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sterilization and Minors with Intersex Conditions in California Law|url = http://www.californialawreview.org/sterilization-and-minors-with-intersex-conditions-in-california-law/|website = California Law Review|date = April 19, 2012|last = Tamar-Mattis|first = Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical integrity and bodily autonomy===

In 2014, following testimony by then staff member [[Pidgeon Pagonis]], [[Anne Tamar-Mattis]] was published on medical interventions as torture in healthcare settings, in a book by the [[Center for Human Rights &amp; Humanitarian Law]] at [[American University]] [[Washington College of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Center for Human Rights &amp; Humanitarian Law| pages = 91–104 | editors = Center for Human Rights &amp; Humanitarian Law, Washington College of Law, American University (eds.)| last = Tamar-Mattis| first = Anne| title = Torture in Healthcare Settings: Reflections on the Special Rapporteur on Torture's 2013 Thematic Report| chapter = Medical Treatment of People with intersex conditions as Torture and cruel, inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment| location = Washington, D.C.| date = 2014| chapterurl = http://antitorture.org/torture-in-healthcare-publication/| accessdate = May 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the United Nations Committee Against Torture asked the United States government to comment on reports of [[intersex medical interventions]] on infants and children, following submission of a report by interACT.&lt;ref name="interact2016un"&gt;{{Cite web| last = interACT| title = Recommendations from interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth regarding the List of Issues for the United States for the 59th Session of the Committee Against Torture| date = June 2016| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_ICS_USA_24552_E.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = United Nations| last2 = Committee against Torture| title = List of issues prior to submission of the sixth periodic report of the United States of America| date = December 2016| url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CAT%2fC%2fUSA%2fQPR%2f6&amp;Lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its submission, interACT stated that it is "unaware of any jurisdiction in the U.S. that enforces its own [[FGM]] laws in cases where the girl undergoing clitoral cutting has an intersex trait".&lt;ref name="interactcat"&gt;{{Cite conference|last=interACT|title=Recommendations from interACT: Advocates for Intersex Youth regarding the List of Issues for the United States for the 59th Session of the Committee Against Torture|date=June 2016|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_ICS_USA_24552_E.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, [[Human Rights Watch]] and interACT published a major report on medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children, "I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me", based on interviews with intersex persons, families and physicians.&lt;ref name="hrw2017b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stewart2017" /&gt; The report found that "Intersex people in the United States are subjected to medical practices that can inflict irreversible physical and psychological harm on them starting in infancy, harms that can last throughout their lives."&lt;ref name="hrw2017"/&gt; The report calls for a ban on "surgical procedures that seek to alter the gonads, genitals, or internal sex organs of children with atypical sex characteristics too young to participate in the decision, when those procedures both carry a meaningful risk of harm and can be safely deferred."&lt;ref name="hrw2017"&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 978-1-62313-502-7| last1 = Human Rights Watch| author1-link = Human Rights Watch | last2 = interACT | author2-link = Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth | title = "I Want to Be Like Nature Made Me"| date = July 2017| url = https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/07/25/i-want-be-nature-made-me/medically-unnecessary-surgeries-intersex-children-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stewart2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Stewart| first = Philippa| title = Interview: Intersex Babies Don't Need 'Fixing' | work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = July 25, 2017 | date = July 25, 2017 | url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/interview-intersex-babies-dont-need-fixing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw2017b"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Human Rights Watch| title = US: Harmful Surgery on Intersex Children| work = Human Rights Watch| accessdate = July 25, 2017 | date = July 25, 2017 | url = https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/us-harmful-surgery-intersex-children}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====M.C. v. Aaronson case====
On May 14, 2013, interACT, [[The Southern Poverty Law Center]], and pro bono counsel for the private law firms of Janet, Jenner &amp; Suggs and [[Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP]] filed a lawsuit against South Carolina Department of Social Services (SCDSS), [[Greenville Health System]], [[Medical University of South Carolina]] and individual employees for performing an irreversible and medically unnecessary surgery on an infant who was in the state's care at the time of the surgery.&lt;ref name=Integrity&gt;{{cite web|title=AIC's Groundbreaking Lawsuit Accuses South Carolina, Doctors and Hospitals of Performing Unnecessary Surgery on Infant|url=http://aiclegal.org/programs/project-integrity/|publisher=Advocates for Informed Choice|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SPLC&gt;{{cite news|title=Groundbreaking SPLC lawsuit accuses South Carolina, doctors and hospitals of unnecessary surgery on infant|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/world-our-backyard/2013/may/18/adoptive-parents-sue-over-sons-sex-assignment-surg/|accessdate=May 22, 2013|newspaper=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|date= May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WashTimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Sesana|first=Laura|title=Adoptive parents sue over son's sex-assignment surgery|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/world-our-backyard/2013/may/18/adoptive-parents-sue-over-sons-sex-assignment-surg/|accessdate=May 22, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date= May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/17/1209792/-Sex-change-surgery-performed-on-16-month-old-South-Carolina-child-without-consent Daily Kos: Sex change surgery performed on 16-month-old South Carolina child without consent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/society/youth/2013/05/14/lawsuit-filed-over-unnecessary-surgery-intersex-baby Lawsuit Filed Over Unnecessary Surgery on Intersex Baby | Advocate.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/hospital-sued-for-performing-unneeded-sex-assignment-su-505780577 Hospital Sued For Performing Unneeded Sex-Assignment Surgery on Baby] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606223129/http://gawker.com/hospital-sued-for-performing-unneeded-sex-assignment-su-505780577 |date=June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants sought to [[motion to dismiss|dismiss]] the case and seek a defense of qualified [[legal immunity|immunity]], but these were denied by the [[District Court for the District of South Carolina]]. In January 2015, the [[Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] reversed this decision and dismissed the complaint, stating that, "it did not 'mean to diminish the severe harm that M.C. claims to have suffered' but that a reasonable official in 2006 did not have fair warning from then-existing precedent that performing sex assignment surgery on sixteen-month-old M.C. violated a clearly established constitutional right."&lt;ref name="largent2015"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2015/03/05/m-c-v-aaronson-update/ | title = M.C. v.

===Youth leadership development===

interACT Youth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://interactyouth.org/|title = interACT Youth |date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a program for intersex youth, run by intersex youth. All members between 14 and 25 years old, have intersex traits, and are in a place where they are ready to speak out about their experiences. interACT Youth works to provide tomorrow's scholars and activists a platform for their vital perspectives. A product of this work entitled "What We Wish Our Doctors Knew"&lt;ref&gt;http://aiclegal.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/interact_ms-updated.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of its kind: Intersex youth talking back to medical providers and caregivers. InterACT Youth is funded in part by [[Ms. Foundation]] and [[Liberty Hill Foundation]].

In 2013, the then youth leadership coordinator,&lt;ref name="paper-aug2016"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hilary Weaver|title=Meet Chicago's White-House-Honored Intersex Activist, Pidgeon Pagonis|url=http://www.papermag.com/meet-chicagos-white-house-honored-intersex-activist-pidgeon-pagonis-1967101092.html|website=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pidgeon Pagonis]], testified for interACT before the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] about the medical interventions they were subjected to as an intersex child,&lt;ref name="interact-apr2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pursuit of Happiness in Our Original Beautiful Bodies: Pidgeon Pagonis' Recent Testimony before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|url=http://interactadvocates.org/the-pursuit-of-happiness-in-our-original-beautiful-bodies-pidgeon-pagonis-recent-testimony-before-the-inter-american-commission-on-human-rights/|website=interACT|accessdate=January 8, 2017|date=April 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside Latin Americans [[Mauro Cabral]], [[Natasha Jiménez]] and Paula Machado.&lt;ref name="iachr"&gt;{{Cite|publisher=Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|last=Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos|title=Violencia contra Personas Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales, Trans e Intersex en América|date=November 2015|url=http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/informes/pdfs/ViolenciaPersonasLGBTI.pdf|authorlink=Inter-American Commission on Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media work===

interACT has worked with [[MTV]] on the program ''[[Faking It (2014 TV series)|Faking It]]'', notable for providing the first intersex main character in a television show,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Meet television's groundbreaking intersex character |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/meet-televisions-groundbreaking-intersex-character|website=Buzzfeed }}&lt;/ref&gt; and television's first intersex character played by an intersex actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/faking-it-intersex/04/2016/|title="Faking It" Breaks New Ground With First Intersex Actor To Play Intersex Character On TV|website=New Now Next|access-date= April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, interACT began working with Belgian-born model [[Hanne Gaby Odiele]] to tackle social taboos and unnecessary surgeries.&lt;ref name="miller2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/23/model-hanne-gaby-odiele-reveals-she-intersex/96622908/ | title = Model Hanne Gaby Odiele reveals she is intersex | last = Miller | first = Susan | work = [[USA Today]] | date = January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interAct2017han"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PRESSRELEASE-HannesAnnouncement.pdf | title = International Fashion Model Hanne Gaby Odiele Reveals She is Intersex: Announces Partnership with interACT Advocates for Intersex Youth to Raise Awareness About the Importance of Human Rights Protections for Intersex People Worldwide | work = interACT | date = January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

interACT published a media guide on covering intersex issues in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last = interACT| title = Media Guide, Covering the Intersex Community| date = January 2017| url = http://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/INTERSEX-MEDIAGUIDE-interACT.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===

Having historically used the current clinical terminology of [[disorders of sex development]], interACT issued a strong statement favoring the term intersex in 2016, citing increasing acceptance and public awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = interACT| title = interACT Statement on Intersex Terminology| work = interACT| date = May 2016| url = http://interactadvocates.org/interact-statement-on-intersex-terminology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2722">'''The inverse care law''' is the principle that the availability of good medical or social care tends to vary inversely with the need of the population served. Proposed by [[Julian Tudor Hart]] in 1971, the term has since been widely adopted. It is a [[pun]] on [[inverse-square law]], a term and concept from [[physics]].

The law states that:

''"The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served. This ... operates more completely where medical care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=Julian Tudor|title=The Inverse Care Law|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/resources/public-health-and-wellbeing/poverty-and-inequality/the-inverse-care-law/|website=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=27 April 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart later paraphrased his argument: "To the extent that health care becomes a commodity it becomes distributed just like champagne. That is rich people gets lots of it. Poor people don’t get any of it."

The Inverse Care Law is a key issue in the debate about [[health inequality]].  As [[Frank Dobson]] put it when he was [[Secretary of State for Health]]: "Inequality in health is the worst inequality of all. There is no more serious inequality than knowing that you'll die sooner because you're badly off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GOVT TAKES ACTION TO REDUCE HEALTH INEQUALITIES|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/govt-takes-action-to-reduce-health-inequalities/1494985.article|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=Local Government Chronicle|date=12 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laya Healthcare''' is a [[health insurance]] company in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Its headquarters are in [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]], [[County Cork]]. It is regulated by the [[Health Insurance Authority]].

==History==
BUPA Ireland entered the private medical insurance market in Ireland in 1997 ending the [[Vhi Healthcare]] monopoly which had existed for almost 40 years following the opening of the health insurance market in Ireland in 1994.&lt;ref name="Health Insurance Act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0016/index.html|title=Health Insurance Act 1994|publisher=Irish Statute Book|date=30 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, BUPA Ireland announced that it would be leaving the Irish market as the High Court had left the Risk Equalisation scheme unchallenged. BUPA Ireland argued it could not afford to make a cash transfer to Vhi Healthcare as required under the Risk Equalisation Scheme. In February 2007 the [[QUINN group]] acquired BUPA Ireland and renamed it QUINN-healthcare.&lt;ref name=RTE&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0417/quinn.html Quinn Group announces 500 Fermoy jobs] RTÉ News, 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finfacts.ie&gt;[http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1014214.shtml Irish Supreme Court rules in favour of BUPA in risk equalisation case against the Government] Finfacts Ireland, 16 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As a new insurer, QUINN-healthcare was exempt from the Risk Equalisation payments for three years which was the normal concession granted to any new market entrant. In 1994 the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] ruled that the Governments Risk Equalisation specifications were incompatible with the ''Health Insurance Act 1994'' and must be set aside. But the ''Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill December 2008'' proposed a new scheme of levies on all health insurance members to be used to fund a new system of tax credits for those over 50 who have private medical insurance.&lt;ref name=Citizenship&gt;[http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/health/health-insurance/private_health_insurance Private health insurance] Private Medical Insurance in Ireland, a short summary; Citizens Information Board, 24 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, the future of the entity came into question, as its holder, the QUINN group, fell into administration, and was looking to sell off its insurance assets in the UK and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurancetimes.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=13&amp;storycode=384920 Quinn health price tag: €20m?] Insurance Times, 14 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A plan was considered by the Irish Government to buy QUINN-healthcare and merge it with Vhi Healthcare, but was not acted on.&lt;ref name=IT_22062012/&gt;

==Management buy-out and re-branding==
On 23 December 2011 Dónal Clancy, Managing Director of QUINN-healthcare announced that a senior management bid enabled by [[Swiss Re]] as the re-insurer was successfully concluded with the administrators. Bruce Hodkinson of Swiss Re, confirmed that Elips Life (a wholly owned subsidiary of Swiss Re) would be the underwriter.

The company was re-branded in May 2012 as Laya Healthcare.&lt;ref name=IT_22062012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/0622/1224318449949.html|title=Laya in rude good health after scare|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laya means "Looking After You Always".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0501/quinn-healthcare-laya-healthcare.html|title=Quinn Healthcare rebranding as Laya Healthcare from 14 May|work=[[RTÉ News]]|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laya Healthcare is currently the second largest health insurer in Ireland.

On 1 April 2015, [[American International Group|AIG]] acquired Laya Healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.layahealthcare.ie/pressandmedia/pressreleases/aig-completes-the-acquisition-of-laya-healthcare.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
[[File:Our Lady the Vivifying Fountain.jpg|right|thumb|Russian icon of the Theotokos, ''Life-giving Spring'', 17th century]]
Outside the Imperial City of Constantinople, near the [[Walls of Constantinople#Golden Gate|Golden Gate]] (''Porta Aurea'') used to be found a grove of trees. A [[shrine]] was located there with a spring of water, which from early times had been dedicated to the [[Theotokos]]. Over time, the [[Sacred Grove|grove]] had become overgrown and the spring became fetid.&lt;ref name="Kovalchuk"&gt;Kovalchuk, Archpriest Feodor S. (1985). ''Wonder-Working Icons of the Theotokos.'' Youngstown OH: Central States Deanery, pp.67–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sacred Tradition|traditional]] account surrounding the feast of the Life-Giving Spring is recorded by [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos]], the last of the Greek ecclesiastical historians, who flourished around 1320. It begins with a miracle that occurred involving a soldier named Leo Marcellus, the future [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo&amp;nbsp;I]]. On April 4, 450,&lt;ref name="Kovalchuk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://hramkgu.ru/publ/chitaem_ikonu/ikona_bozhiej_materi_zhivonosnyj_istochnik/7-1-0-93 Икона Божией Матери «Живоносный Источник»] Храм Святых равноапостольных Кирилла и Мефодия.&lt;/ref&gt; as Leo was passing by the grove, he came across a blind man who had become lost. Leo took pity on him, led him to the pathway, seated him in the shade and began to search for water to give the thirsty man. Leo heard a voice say to him, "Do not trouble yourself, Leo, to look for water elsewhere, it is right here!" Looking about, he could see no one, and neither could he see any water. Then he heard the voice again, 
[[File:Saint Mary Of The Spring 2010-10-09 02.jpg|left|thumb|135px|The [[Holy well]] (''hagiasma'') of the [[Church of St. Mary of the Spring (Istanbul)|Church of the Life Giving Font (Istanbul)]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Leo, ''Emperor'', go into the grove, take the water which you will find and give it to the thirsty man. Then take the mud [from the stream] and put it on the blind man's eyes.... And build a [[temple]] [church] here ... that all who come here will find answers to their [[Prayer|petitions]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leo did as he was told, and when the blind man's eyes were anointed he regained his sight.

After his accession to the throne, the Emperor erected a magnificent church on this site, dedicated to the [[Theotokos]],&lt;ref name=HOROLOGION/&gt; and the water continued to work miraculous cures, as well as [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrections from the dead]], through the [[intercession of the Theotokos]], and therefore it was called "The Life-Giving Spring."&lt;ref name=ANTIOCHIAN/&gt;

==Church==
{{main|Church of St. Mary of the Spring (Istanbul)}}
Historians [[Procopius]] and [[Cedrenus]] state that [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Justinian]] erected a new church, larger than the first, in the last years of his reign (559-560), utilizing materials that had remained after the erection of the [[Hagia Sophia]].&lt;ref name=JANIN/&gt; After the erection of the sanctuary, the Byzantines named the Gate that was situated outside the [[Walls of Constantinople#Theodosian Walls|walls of Theodosius&amp;nbsp;II]] ''"[[Walls of constantinople#Gate of the Spring|Gate of the Spring]]"'' ({{lang-el|Πύλη τῆς Πηγῆς}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Müller-Wiener, Wolfgang (1977). ''Bildlexikon zur Topographie Istanbuls: Byzantion, Konstantinupolis, Istanbul bis zum Beginn d. 17 Jh..'' Tübingen: Wasmuth.  p.416.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the church was torn down by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], and the stones used to build a [[mosque]] of [[Bayezid II Mosque|Sultan Bayezid]].  Only a small chapel remained at the site of the church. Twenty-five steps led down to the site of the spring, surrounded by a railing. In 1547 the French humanist [[Petrus Gyllius]] noted that the church no longer existed, but that ailing people continued to visit the spring of [[holy water]].&lt;ref name=ECUMEN/&gt;

As a result of the [[Greek War of Independence]] of 1821, even the little chapel was destroyed and the spring was left buried under the rubble.

In 1833 the reforming [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud&amp;nbsp;II]] gave permission for the Christians to rebuild the church. When the foundations of the original church were discovered during the course of construction, the Sultan issued a second [[firman]] permitting not only the reconstruction of the small chapel, but of a large church according to the original dimensions. Construction was completed on December 30, 1834, and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]], [[Ecumenical Patriarchs of Constantinople|Constantius&amp;nbsp;II]] [[consecrated]] the church on February 2, 1835, celebrating with 12 bishops and an enormous flood of the faithful.

On September 6, 1955, during the anti-Greek [[Istanbul Pogrom]], the church was one of the targets of the fanatic mob. The building was burned to the ground while the abbot was lynched, and 90-year-old [[Archimandrite]] Chrisanthos Mantas was assassinated by the mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Λιμπιτσιούνη|first=Ανθή Γ.|script-title=el:Το πλέγμα των ελληνοτουρκικών σχέσεων και η ελληνική μειονότητα στην Τουρκία, οι Έλληνες της Κωνσταντινούπολης της Ίμβρου και της Τενέδου|url=http://invenio.lib.auth.gr/record/113326/files/LIBITSIOUNI.pdf?version=1|publisher=University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=3 October 2011|pages=23–24|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another small chapel has been rebuilt on the site, but the church has not yet been restored to its former size. The spring still flows to this day and is considered by the faithful to have [[Thaumaturge|wonderworking]] properties.

==Feast day==
[[File:Procession -- Feast of Life-Giving Font -- Arcadia, Greece, 1959.jpg|right|thumb|Procession on the feast day of the Life-giving Spring, [[Bright Friday]] 1959, Arcadia, Greece]]
The feast day is observed on [[Bright Friday]], that is, the Friday following [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter). It is the only feast day which may be celebrated during Bright Week, as all other commemorations which happen to fall during this time are usually transferred to another day. The [[propers]] (hymns and prayers) of the feast are combined with the Paschal hymns, and there is often a [[Lesser Blessing of Waters]] performed after the [[Divine Liturgy]] on Bright Friday.

There is also a commemoration of the [[Icon]] of the Theotokos the ''Life-giving Spring'' observed on [[April 4 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|April 4]] ([[Julian Calendar]]) / April 17 ([[Gregorian Calendar]]).&lt;ref name=PRAVOSLAVIE/&gt;

This type of icon spread throughout the [[Byzantine commonwealth|Orthodox world]], particularly in places where a spring was believed to be [[Holy well|sacred]].&lt;ref name=ECUMEN/&gt;

In old [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], continuing Greek traditions, there was a custom to sanctify [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] that were located near [[Church (building)|churches]], dedicate them to the [[Theotokos|Holy Mother]], and paint icons of her under the title ''The Life Giving Spring''.&lt;ref&gt;Kristina Kondratieva (Global Art Communications project). ''[http://www.iconkuznetsov.com/index.php?sid=341&amp;did=264&amp;lang=eng Panagia The Life Giving Spring].'' Yuriy Kuznetsov: Icons of the XXI Century. Accessed: 2011-05-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar revelation of the Theotokos occurred in Estonia in the 16th century. The [[Pühtitsa Convent]] is located on a site where, according to a 16th-century legend, near the local village of [[Kuremäe]], a shepherd witnessed a divine revelation of the [[Theotokos]] near a spring of water that is to this day venerated as holy and is famous for many miracles and healings. The icon, which was painted much later, is known as the ''Pühtitsa icon of the Mother of God "To the spring"'' ({{ru icon}}: Пюхтицкая икона Божией Матери «У источника»).&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.portal-slovo.ru/art/43233.php Пюхтицкая икона Божией Матери «У источника»]. Православные.Ру. 07.07.2010. Retrieved: 2013-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hymns==
In the 9th century, [[Joseph the Hymnographer]] gave the title "Zoodochos Pege" (''Life-giving Spring'') to a [[Theotokion|hymn]] (''Theotokion'') for the [[Mother of God]] for the first time.&lt;ref name=ECUMEN/&gt;

[[Apolytikion]] (Tone 3)&lt;ref name=OMHKSEA&gt;[[Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia]]. ''[http://www.omhksea.org/2011/05/bright-friday/ Bright Friday].'' Accessed: 2011-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some are large companies that own the entire process for economic reasons; others aim to control the whole process to improve quality, working conditions, or environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/02/13/171891081/bean-to-bar-chocolate-makers-dare-to-bare-how-its-done|title=Bean-To-Bar Chocolate Makers Dare To Bare How It's Done|date=14 February 2013|work=NPR.org|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] postulated that women were more prone to [[neurosis]] because they experienced aggression towards the self, which stemmed from developmental issues. Freud's postulation is countered by the idea that societal factors, such as [[gender role]]s, may play a major role in the development of mental illness. When considering gender and mental illness, one must look to both biology and social/cultural factors to explain areas in which men and women develop different mental illnesses. Societal [[patriarchy]] and gender roles have adverse effects on the psychological perceptions of both men and women. These gender roles may include the pressure on men not to show their emotions and the fact that women, on average, have lower self-esteem and sense of control than men. When certain factors, such as work outside the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], are controlled, women and men tend to experience a full range of mental illnesses at approximately equal rates. In some cases when such factors were controlled, women showed lower rates of mental illness on the whole.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite book

The [[object relations theory]] postulates that because women are mostly responsible for parenting, mothers emphasize the importance of relationships to their daughters while pushing their sons into independence. Sarah Rosenfield uses this theory to argue that males and females develop different types of symptoms when they are mentally ill. Men tend to display externalized symptoms, expressing problematic emotions in outward behavior. Women tend to develop internalized symptoms, where problematic feelings are directed towards the self. In accordance with the internalized-externalized dichotomy, women are more commonly diagnosed with mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and phobias. Once thought to be more common in women, [[borderline personality disorder]] has been found to be equally prevalent among both men and women.&lt;ref name="Sansone"&gt;{{cite journal

== Violence against women and connections to mental health ==

=== Intimate partner violence and domestic violence ===
[[Intimate partner violence]] (IPV) is a particularly gendered issue. Data collected from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) of women and men aged 18–65 found that women were significantly more likely than men to experience physical and sexual IPV.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coker|first=Ann L|last2=Davis|first2=Keith E|last3=Arias|first3=Ileana|last4=Desai|first4=Sujata|last5=Sanderson|first5=Maureen|last6=Brandt|first6=Heather M|last7=Smith|first7=Paige H|date=1 November 2002|title=Physical and mental health effects of intimate partner violence for men and women|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749379702005147|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|language=English|volume=23|issue=4|pages=260–268|doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(02)00514-7|issn=0749-3797|pmid=12406480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous studies conducted linking the experience of being a survivor of domestic violence to a number of mental health issues, including [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], substance dependence, and suicidal attempts. Humphreys and Thiara (2003) assert that the body of existing research evidence shows a direct link between the experience of IPV and higher rates of [[self-harm]], depression, and trauma symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=Cathy|last2=Thiara|first2=Ravi|date=1 March 2003 |title=Mental Health and Domestic Violence: 'I Call it Symptoms of Abuse'|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/33.2.209|journal=[[The British Journal of Social Work]]|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=209–226|doi=10.1093/bjsw/33.2.209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NVAWS survey found that physical IPV was associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms, substance dependence problems, and chronic mental illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study conducted in 1995 of 171 women reporting a history of domestic violence and 175 reporting no history of domestic violence confirmed these hypotheses. The study found that the women with a history of domestic violence were 11.4 times more likely to suffer dissociation, 4.7 times more likely to suffer anxiety, 3 times as likely to suffer from depression, and 2.3 times more likely to have a substance abuse problem.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PhD|first=Gwenneth L. Roberts|last2=BBus|last3=RN|last4=PhD|first4=Gail M. Williams|last5=MSc|last6=FRC|first6=Joan M. Lawrence|last7=FRANZCP|last8=MD|first8=Beverley Raphael|last9=FRC|date=1999-01-13|title=How Does Domestic Violence Affect Women's Mental Health?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J013v28n01_08|journal=Women &amp; Health|volume=28|issue=1|pages=117–129|doi=10.1300/J013v28n01_08|issn=0363-0242}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same study noted that several of the women interviewed stated that they only began having mental health issues when they began to experience violence in their intimate relationships.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a similar study, 191 women who reported at least one event of IPV in their lifetime were tested for PTSD. 33% of the women tested positively were lifetime PTSD, and 11.4% tested positive for current PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Gwenneth L.|last2=Lawrence|first2=Joan M.|last3=Williams|first3=Gail M.|last4=Raphael|first4=Beverley|date=1998-12-01|title=The impact of domestic violence on women's mental health|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-842X.1998.tb01496.x/abstract|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=22|issue=7|pages=796–801|doi=10.1111/j.1467-842X.1998.tb01496.x|issn=1753-6405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that in a group of women in a psychiatric inpatient hospital ward, women who were survivors of domestic violence were twice as likely to suffer depression as those were not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; All twenty of the women interviewed fit into a pattern of symptoms associated with trauma-based mental health disorders. Six of the women had attempted suicide. Moreover, the women spoke openly of a direct connection between the IPV they suffered and their resulting mental disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The direct psychological effects of IPV may contribute directly to the development of these disorders. In Humphreys' and Thiara's study, 60% of the women interviewed feared for their life, 69% feared for their emotional wellbeing, and 60% feared for their mental health. Some of the women discussed an undermining of their self-esteem, as well as an "overwhelming fear and erosion of their sense of safety."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Johnson and Ferraro (2000) refer to this overwhelming fear as "intimate terrorism," decimating a women's sense of security and contributing to a worsening psychological state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Michael P.|last2=Ferraro|first2=Kathleen J.|date=2000-11-01|title=Research on Domestic Violence in the 1990s: Making Distinctions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00948.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=62|issue=4|pages=948–963|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00948.x|issn=1741-3737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humphreys and Thiara (2003) refer to these consequential mental disorders as "symptoms of abuse". That sentiment is echoed by some survivors who don't feel comfortable identifying with loaded diagnoses such as depression or PTSD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Medical screening for domestic violence ===
Scholars studying the effects of IPV on mental health note the necessity of screening for domestic violence in primary care patients. Roberts, Williams, Lawrence and Raphael (2008) conclude from their study that women who presented to doctors with somatic symptoms including abdominal pain and headaches are often subjected to a variety of investigative tests, without domestic violence ever being raised as a potential cause.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

McLeer, Anwar, Herman and Maquiling (1989) find from their research that when protocol for detection of IPV was introduced, the rate of identification of battered women increased from 5.6% to 30% in one year.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLeer|first=Susan V|last2=Anwar|first2=A.H. Rebecca|last3=Herman|first3=Suzanne|last4=Maquiling|first4=Kevin|date=1989-06-01|title=Education is not enough: A systems failure in protecting battered women|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0196064489805219|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine|language=English|volume=18|issue=6|pages=651–653|doi=10.1016/s0196-0644(89)80521-9|issn=0196-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt; When followed up eight years later, only 7.7% were identified.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Ramsay, Richardson, Carter, Davidson and Feder (2002) found in a systematic review that about half to three-quarters of women in primary care responding to surveys believe that routine screening for domestic violence is acceptable, and a higher proportion is shown among women with a history of having been abused. In contrast, only a minority of nurses and doctors favored screening, shown in the results of two surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jean|last2=Richardson|first2=Jo|last3=Carter|first3=Yvonne H.|last4=Davidson|first4=Leslie L.|last5=Feder|first5=Gene|date=2002-08-10|title=Should health professionals screen women for domestic violence? Systematic review|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/325/7359/314|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=325|issue=7359|pages=314|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7359.314|issn=0959-8138|pmid=12169509|pmc=117773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduction of discussion of domestic violence into standard primary care may have revealing effects in itself. In one case, a domestic violence victim states that "the introduction of the words 'domestic violence' to me, as hard as they were to swallow, were like a fresh light on my situation because it made me think differently about things."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Treatment options ===
Thiara and Turner (2000) find other obstacles to treatment of IPV survivors include physicians' belief that the abuser requires treatment rather than survivor, a sense of feeling unqualified to treat IPV survivors with the appropriate sensitivity and effectiveness (and therefore sidestepping questions that could lead to IPV disclosure), and overt [[Victim blaming|victim-blaming]].&lt;ref&gt;Thiara, R. and Turner. A. (2000) ''Responses to Domestic Violence by Health Care Professionals.'' London, Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster Health Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors themselves note the need for "immediate and flexible services" including 24/7 hotlines, as well as non-judgmental and victim-trusting approaches from physicians.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another barrier to seeking treatment is that a threat often used against women IPV victims is that they are "crazy", and seeking treatment may seem to a survivor like a confirmation of this sentiment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Even when women have sought treatment, there are still problematic elements to existing treatment services. In mixed-sex hospitals, there have been worrying reports that suggest a lack of safety for women survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, J. and Copperman, J. (2002) ''Mental Health Services that Work for Women: Summary Findings of a UK Survey'', Canterbury, The Tizard Centre, University of Kent.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnstone, L. (2001) 'For better and for worse', ''Mental Health Today,'' December, pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is crucial to adopt an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] approach when considering how to treat survivors. In Humphreys' and Thiara's study, they found that "black and minority ethnic women were significantly more likely than white women to suffer substantial problems both emotionally and materially."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This intersectional approach can include a push for more female doctors, as well as people of color in the medical profession.

==Gender Differences in Mental Illness Following a Traumatic Event==

===Genders Differences in Prevalence===

====Posttraumatic Stress Disorder====

[[Posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is among the most common responses a person can have in response to a traumatic event&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Research has found that women have elevated rates of PTSD compared to men&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Christiansen |first1=Dorte M. |title=A Fresh Look at Anxiety Disorders |date=2015 |publisher=InTech |isbn=9789535121497 |url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/a-fresh-look-at-anxiety-disorders/examining-sex-and-gender-differences-in-anxiety-disorders |language=en |chapter=Examining Sex and Gender Differences in Anxiety Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to epidemiological studies, women are two to three times are likely as men to develop PTSD&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olff |first1=Miranda |title=Sex and gender differences in post-traumatic stress disorder: an update |journal=European Journal of Psychotraumatology |date=27 July 2017 |volume=8 |issue=sup4 |pages=1351204 |doi=10.1080/20008198.2017.1351204 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20008198.2017.1351204 |language=en |issn=2000-8198}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is reported to be about 10-12% in women and 5-6% in men&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Women are also four times as likely to develop chronic PTSD compared to men&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tolin |first1=David |last2=Breslau |first2=Naomi |title=Sex differences in risk of PTSD |journal=PTSD Research Quarterly |date=1 January 2007 |volume=18 |pages=1–7 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283559563_Sex_differences_in_risk_of_PTSD}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, women are at greater risk for developing PTSD despite exposure to fewer traumatic events than men&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. There are even observed differences in the type of symptoms endorsed by men and women&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Women are more likely to endorse specific sub-clusters of symptoms, such as re-experiencing symptoms (e.g. flashbacks) and hyper-arousal symptoms&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.  These differences have been found to be persistent across cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

====Depression====

While PTSD is perhaps the most well-known psychological response to a trauma, [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can also develop following exposure to traumatic events&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=(us) |first1=Center for Substance Abuse Treatment |title=Understanding the Impact of Trauma |date=2014 |publisher=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (US) |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women are twice as likely as men to experience depression; the lifetime prevalence of [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD) is 21.3% in women and 12.7% in men&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nolen-Hoeksema |first1=Susan |title=Gender Differences in Depression |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=October 2001 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=173–176 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00142 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com.paloaltou.idm.oclc.org/doi/10.1111/1467-8721.00142 |issn=0963-7214}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===High-impact Traumas and Gender Differences in Mental Illness===

====Posttraumatic Stress Disorder====

Some have theorized that the observed gender differences are due to women being exposed to more high impact-traumas, such as sexual assault&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Epidemiological studies have found that men are more likely to have PTSD as a result of experiencing combat, war, accidents, nonsexual assaults, disaster or fire, and witnessing death or injury.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Ronald C.|date=1995-12-01|title=Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/archpsyc.1995.03950240066012|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=52|issue=12|pages=1048|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1995.03950240066012|issn=0003-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, women are more likely to have PTSD attributable to rape, sexual assault, sexual molestation, and childhood sexual abuse&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolin|first=David F.|last2=Foa|first2=Edna B.|date=2006|title=Sex differences in trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder: A quantitative review of 25 years of research.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.959|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=132|issue=6|pages=959–992|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.132.6.959|issn=1939-1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, despite the theorized explanation that gender differences were due to differential exposure rates to high impact traumas such as sexual assaults, a meta-analysis found that when excluding instances of sexual assault or abuse, women remained at greater for developing PTSD&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Additionally, it has been found that when only looking at those who have experienced sexual assaults, women remained approximately twice as likely as men to develop PTSD&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Thus, it is likely that exposure to specific traumatic events such as sexual assault only partially accounts for the observed gender differences in PTSD&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;.

====Depression====

Research suggest that gender differences in exposure to traumatic events have serve as an explanation for observed differences in MDD&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. It has been indicated in research that women have been found to have two times the rate of sexual assault as men when sexual assault is defined as being pressured or forced into unwanted sexual contact&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. A history of sexual assault is thought to be related to increased rates of depression. For example, studies of survivors of childhood sexual assault found that the rates of childhood sexual assault ranged from 7-19% for women and 3-7% for men. This gender discrepancy in childhood sexual assault in turn contributed to 35% of the observed gender difference in adult depression&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. It is also thought that the increased likelihood of adverse traumatic experiences in childhood may also help to explain the observed gender difference in MDD. Studies show that women have been found to have an increased risk of experiencing traumatic events in childhood, especially childhood sexual abuse&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Piccinelli |first1=Marco |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Greg |title=Gender differences in depression: Critical review |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |date=2000 |volume=177 |issue=6 |pages=486–492 |doi=10.1192/bjp.177.6.486 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/gender-differences-in-depression/0770B51752F17A5A081F9878B0952608 |language=en |issn=0007-1250}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This increased risk of experiencing traumatic events in childhood has been associated with an increased risk of developing depression, making women more sensitive to developing depression than men&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.

===Biology and Gender Differences in Mental Illness===

====Posttraumatic Stress Disorder====

Biological differences is a proposed mechanism contributing to observed gender differences in PTSD. Dysregulation of the [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis]] has been proposed for both men and women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donner |first1=Nina C. |last2=Lowry |first2=Christopher A. |title=Sex differences in anxiety and emotional behavior |journal=Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology |date=2013 |volume=465 |issue=5 |pages=601–626 |doi=10.1007/s00424-013-1271-7 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3805826/ |issn=0031-6768}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The HPA helps to regulate an individual’s stress response by changing the amount of stress hormones released into the body, such as [[cortisol]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. However, a meta-analysis found that women have greater dysregulation than men; women have been found to have lower circulating cortisol concentrations compared to healthy controls, where men did not have this difference in cortisol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meewisse |first1=Marie-Louise |last2=Reitsma |first2=Johannes B. |last3=Vries |first3=Giel-Jan De |last4=Gersons |first4=Berthold P. R. |last5=Olff |first5=Miranda |title=Cortisol and post-traumatic stress disorder in adults: Systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |date=2007 |volume=191 |issue=5 |pages=387–392 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.024877 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/cortisol-and-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults/6FFFD1E8E88D99439D7BC2D0B46AD820 |language=en |issn=0007-1250}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also thought that gender differences in threat appraisal might contribute to observed gender differences in PTSD as well by contributing to HPA dysregulation&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olff|first=Miranda|last2=Langeland|first2=Willie|last3=Draijer|first3=Nel|last4=Gersons|first4=Berthold P. R.|date=2007|title=Gender differences in posttraumatic stress disorder.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.183|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=133|issue=2|pages=183–204|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.183|issn=1939-1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women are reported to be more likely to appraise events as stressful and to report higher perceived distress in response to traumatic events compared to men, potentially leading to an increased dysregulation of the HPA in women than in men&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;. However, research looking at potential biological explanations for gender differences in PTSD is in its infancy, and further research is needed before conclusions can be drawn.

====Depression====

As with PTSD, there has also been some evidence of a biological difference between men and women that may contribute to the observed gender difference&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Expanding on the research concerning the HPA and PTSD, one existing hypothesis is that women are more likely than men to have a dysregulated HPA in response to a traumatic event, like in PTSD. This dysregulation may occur as a result of the increased likelihood of women experiencing a traumatic event, as traumatic events have been known to contribute to HPA dysregulation&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Differences in stress hormone levels can influence moods due to the negative effect of high cortisol concentrations on biochemicals that regular mood such as [[serotonin]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Research has found that people with MDD have elevated cortisol levels in response to stress and that low serotonin levels are related to the development of depression&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. Thus, it is possible that a dysregulation in the HPA, when combined with the increased history of traumatic events, may contribute to the gender differences seen in depression&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

===Coping Mechanisms and Gender Differences in PTSD===

For PTSD, genders differences in coping mechanisms has been proposed as a potential explanation for observed gender differences in PTSD prevalence rates&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Studies have found that women tend to respond differently to stressful situations than men. For example, men are more likely than women to react using the fight-or-flight response&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Additionally, men are more likely to use problem-focused coping&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, which is known to decrease the risk of developing PTSD when a stressor is perceived to be within an individual’s control&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hundt |first1=Natalie |last2=Williams |first2=Ann |last3=Mendelson |first3=Jenna |last4=Nelson-Gray |first4=Rosemery |title=Coping mediates relationships between reinforcement sensitivity and symptoms of psychopathology |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=1 April 2013 |volume=54 |pages=726–731 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.11.028 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257045511_Coping_mediates_relationships_between_reinforcement_sensitivity_and_symptoms_of_psychopathology}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Women, meanwhile, are thought to use emotion-focused, defensive, and palliative coping strategies&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. As well, women are more likely to engage in strategies such as wishful thinking, mental disengagement, and the suppression of traumatic memories. These coping strategies have been found in research to correlate with an increased likelihood of developing PTSD&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Women are more likely to blame themselves following a traumatic event than men, which has been found to increase an individual’s risk of PTSD&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. In addition, women have been found to be more sensitive to a loss of social support following a traumatic event than men&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. A variety of differences in coping mechanisms and use of coping mechanisms may likely play a role in observed gender differences in PTSD.

These described differences in coping mechanisms are in line with a preliminary model of sex-specific pathways to PTSD. The model, proposed by Christiansen and Elklit&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, suggests that there are sex differences in the physiological stress response. In this model, variables such as dissociation, social support, and use of emotion-focused coping may be involved in the development and maintenance of PTSD in women, whereas physiological arousal, anxiety, avoidant coping, and use of problem-focused coping may be more likely to be related to the development and maintenance of PTSD in men&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. However, this model is only preliminary and further research is needed.

'''Mi-Case''' is a suite of web-based [[Medical case management|case management]] and [[operations management]] software provided by CASMACO Ltd. (trading as Mi-Case). Mi-Case is used in public and commercial sector organisations including criminal justice and behavioural health agencies to underpin a multi-agency/institutional approach to offender management, correctional services, drug and alcohol abuse, policing, probation, healthcare and the court system. The Mi-Case Upstream range  is used by the upstream [[oil and gas]] industry to support [[incident management]] as well as risk and [[root cause analysis]] in production.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

== History ==
Mi-Case was launched in early 2006 by an international consulting and software firm, Mi-Services, headquartered in UK and US. Mi-Case was born out of the work done with UK Drug Intervention Programmes (DIPs), Drug Action Teams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Honey |first=Alan |title=Mi-Case from Business &amp; Decision |magazine=Information Management |date=July–August 2009 |url=https://www.information-management.com/news/mi-case-from-business-decision |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Case Management? |url=https://www.psychologyschoolguide.net/social-work-careers/case-manager/ |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and treatment providers to assist them and other types of agencies and initiatives in their operations: to increase [[Medical case management|case management]], demonstrate performance and enable best practice when sharing (offender/patient) data. The company was acquired later in the same year by a larger global consulting and systems integration company, [[Business &amp; Decision]]. Since March 2012 it has operated as Casmaco Ltd., which is a majority owned subsidiary of Business &amp; Decision Group, serving the USA, UK and continental European markets.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Software ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Mi-Case is a suite of web-based case management and operations management including: Mi-Case [[Criminal Justice]], Mi-Case Behavioural [[Healthcare]] and Mi-Case [[Oil and Gas]] range of solutions. 
The Mi-Case Criminal Justice and Behavioural Health have been designed to enable clients to be tracked through their cycle of interventions and maintain a continuity of treatment and/or attention. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Mi-Case is developed for:
* Groups of organisations sharing information on a common client or supporting a common initiative
* Single organisations needing to case manage a person as they progress (or regress) through a process

Mi-Case can track and record key client information in relation to:
* Objectives, actions and outcomes of client meetings
* Treatment modalities
* Court appearances
* Arrests and prison sentences
* Identification of risks and issues
* Drug usage, prescriptions
* Other social care interventions

=== Oil and Gas ===
The Mi-Case approach to web based data sharing has also been applied to the commercial sector and is used by [[Upstream (oil industry)|upstream oil]] and gas organisations to manage off shore / on shore data sharing on production equipment and shift management.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Technology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Mi-Case was originally developed using [[Active Server Pages]] but was later upgraded to [[Microsoft .NET]]. It sits on an [[Oracle database]] and has been upgraded to later versions of the database broadly as they have become available or widely used. Mi-Case uses [[128 bit]] encryption of data being transmitted across the internet as part of its data security approach.

== Users ==
=== United Kingdom ===
Mi-Case is used by 30 customers in the UK, most of which are directly linked to the UK [[Home Office]] directives and UK [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) initiatives.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== United States ===
=== State of Maryland ===
In February 2009 Business &amp; Decision was awarded a $12.5m contract by the [[Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services]] (DPSCS) to implement Mi-Case to replace numerous information silos and legacy applications managing ‘offender case management’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=3 February 2009 |title=Business &amp; Decision Is Awarded $12.5m Contract for Mi-Case, Case Management Solution |location=London, England |publisher=Business &amp; Decision |url=http://group.businessdecision.com/News/551/1067-news.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three phases of this project went live in 2011. By fall 2012 Mi-Case is scheduled to provide all DPSCS agencies with accurate and timely access to integrated data captured throughout the lifecycle of an offender from arrest, booking, pre-trial, incarceration, and through supervision in the community. The solution also allows for information sharing with local [[law enforcement]] and other criminal justice partners. Mi-Case is used by all of DPSCS' divisions to manage the interaction with offenders in accordance with the State’s requirements of best practice and to obtain [[management information]] and reports.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11104">The {{Nihongo|'''Muraiken Undō'''|無癩県運動|Muraiken Undō}}, or '''No Leprosy Patients in Our Prefecture Movement'''{{disputed inline|date=October 2015}}, was a government funded [[Japan]]ese [[public health]] and [[social movement]] which began between 1929 and 1934. Its mission was to systematically eliminate [[leprosy]], (Hansen's disease), a readily transmissible, previously incurable, chronic infectious disease caused by [[Mycobacterium leprae|M. leprae]], from each [[prefecture (Japan)|prefecture]] in Japan. This was to be achieved by caring for those afflicted by the disease in government funded [[sanatorium]]s.

==Origin==
In 1927, the Japanese government planned the dissolution of leprosy communities (leper colonies). The district welfare officers of [[Aichi Prefecture]], [[Mamoru Uchida]] and Soichiro Shiotani, studied the conditions of the communities of the Honmyoji Temple in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]]. Six patients wished to enter the Kyushu Sanatorium, (later [[Kikuchi Keifuen Sanatorium]]). However, they were refused by [[Matsuki Miyazaki]], the director of the sanatorium. Uchida and Shiotani brought the patients to [[Kensuke Mitsuda]] at the [[Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium]]. Together, the welfare officers and Mitsuda initiated the movement. In 1931, the concept was made law. In the same year, the [[Empress Teimei]] founded the Leprosy Prevention Association. [[Eiichi Shibusawa]] was its president. The birthday of the empress, around 25 June, marked the beginning of an annual Leprosy Prevention Week. In 1952, at the time of the death of the empress, the name of the Leprosy Prevention Association was changed to Tofu Kyokai.&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto [1993:127]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sato [2007:44-53]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siguyama [2006:]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Miyake [1978:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The movement==
The governor of each prefecture raised funds for the building of leprosy sanatoriums. The movement and its slogans, for example, "donate 10-tsubo houses (33.058 square meters) to sanatoriums", were publicised in newspapers, radio, film advertisements, and through religious groups, schools and other organisations. For example, a Jodo Shinshu school founded an association called Otani Komyokai to popularise the movement.
&lt;ref&gt;Shinshu Ohtaniha [1996:65,83]&lt;/ref&gt; Patients were forcibly hospitalised.

==Public response==
Public interest in the movement varied between prefectures and over time. The people of  [[Tottori Prefecture]] were most supportive of the movement. Kiyotatsu Tatsuda, the governor of Tottori prefecture, raised funds for the movement, invited Mitsuda to give lectures about the movemen and built six houses in the Airakuen sanatorium to accommodate leprosy patients from Tottori Prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;Tottori Prefecture[ 2008:65-72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tottori Prefecture [2008:1-94]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], [[Miyagi Prefecture]], [[Toyama Prefecture]], [[Okayama Prefecture]], [[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Aichi Prefecture]] and [[Mie Prefecture]] were also supportive.

==Problems==
The forced hospitalisation increased the [[leprosy stigma]] of the patients, their families and their neighbourhoods. Some patients were transferred beyond their own neighbourhoods, increasing their isolation. The conditions in sanatoriums suffered from overcrowding. Food ran short. In 1936, riots occurred and some patients escaped.

==Masako Ogawa==
[[Masako Ogawa]] was a Japanese physician who worked at the Nagashima Aiseien sanatorium. In 1938, she wrote the book, ''Spring in a Small Island'' which later became a film. She wrote of her experiences in persuading leprosy sufferers in remote areas to be hospitalised. Some criticised Ogawa for accelerating the "No leprosy patients our in prefecture" movement and giving an impression that leprosy was to be feared.&lt;ref&gt;Ogawa [1938:]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Arai [1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second movement==
On 31 December 1947, the Japanese government's Ministry of Interior Affairs, which had been responsible leprosy control, was abolished. After [[World War II]], welfare officers were less involved because their role had induced stigma. Responsibility for control of leprosy was transferred to the prefectures. The names of patients previously reported to the head of police stations were reported to governors of prefectures. In November 1947, the  Ministry of Welfare commented on the "No leprosy patients in our prefecture" movement. It stated that the elimination of leprosy was important for the building of a cultural state, and therefore, should be accomplished. Hospitalization should be commenced with the most contagious patients. 
In 1949, the government advised that training courses for physicians and technicians should begin; physical examination of all citizens should occur and patients should be hospitalised, even on rumour. 
In 1952, [[Matsuo Fujimoto]], an hospitalised leprosy sufferer of Kumamoto, was tried, found guilty and executed for murder. His execution was contentious because some people felt he was being unfairly treated because he was a leper. 
By 1955, the government bodies responsible for control of leprosy included the ministry of welfare; the prefectures; the departments of public health and medicine; the section of tuberculosis prevention and the national sanatoria. Working for the movement were medical schools and physicians, news media, women's groups, schools and religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Tofu Association [1955:]&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians who lectured for the movement included [[Kensuke Mitsuda]], [[Fumio Hayashi (doctor)]], [[Isamu Tajiri]] and [[Mamoru Uchida]].

==Apologies==
The following apology was issued by the Ohtani Sect of Jōdo Shinshu Buddhism:&lt;ref&gt;Nomura [1996:120]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
The 1931 leprosy prevention law of Japan aimed at the segregation of leprosy patients for the safety of healthy individuals.  Later, the necessity of segregation was negated scientifically. With several amendments of the law, the leprosy prevention law was finally outlawed through longtime endeavors of the national Hansen's disease patients councils. In the first place, it is to be stressed that the law aimed at the segregation of leprosy patients, at the erasure of leprosy patients from the society to create a safe society of healthy people. This planted an eranous concept that people with leprosy were dangerous people requiring segregation and justifying segregation. In 1931, our Otani section started an Ohtani Komyokai in order to advance the no leprosy in our prefecture movement  in accord with [[Kensuke Mitsuda]], without hearing the opinion of [[Noboru Ogasawara]]. We could not recognize the significance of segregatory policy of leprosy which committed an outrage upon human rights. We did comfort sermons to patients, but the sermons might be only helpful in persuading them to accept the present situation, namely, segregation. Now we have to accept criticisms and have to repent of our sins. We apologize to patients with leprosy and their families who had endured the sufferings of segregation for committing our failure.
}}

In 2001, when the leprosy prevention law was ruled unconstitutional, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Welfare, and the [[National Diet]] published statements of apology to leprosy patients and their families. Several prefectural governors made apologies at public sanatoriums.

==Compensation==
In 2001, compensation to patients hospitalised between 1960 and 1998 was legislated. The compensation varied between 8,000,000 yen to 14,000,000 yen per person.

'''The Pirbright Institute''' (formerly the '''Institute for Animal Health''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Surrey]], England, dedicated to the study of [[infectious disease]]s of [[livestock|farm animals]]. It forms part of the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government's]] [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC). The Institute employs scientists, vets, PhD students and operations staff.

==History==
It began in 1914 to test cows for [[tuberculosis]]. More buildings were added in 1925. Compton was established by the [[Agricultural Research Council]] in 1937. Pirbright became a research institute in 1939 and Compton in 1942. The Houghton Poultry Research Station at [[Houghton, Cambridgeshire]] was established in 1948. In 1963 Pirbright became the Animal Virus Research Institute and Compton became the Institute for Research on Animal Diseases. The Neuropathogenesis Unit (NPU) was established in Edinburgh in 1981. This became part of the [[Roslin Institute]] in 2007.

In 1987, Compton, Houghton and Pirbright became the Institute for Animal Health, being funded by BBSRC. Houghton closed in 1992, operations at Compton are being rapidly wound down with the site due to close in 2015.

The [[Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research]] was sited at Compton until October 2005.

Significant investment (over £170 million) is taking place at Pirbright with the development of new world class laboratory and animal facilities. The Institute has been known as "The Pirbright Institute" since October 2012.

==Directors of note==

*Dr [[John Burns Brooksby]] 1964 until 1980&lt;ref&gt;http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiogmem/53/77.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The work previously carried out at Compton has either moved out to the university sector, ended or has been transferred to the Pirbright Site. The Compton site currently carries out work on [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] (commonplace) animal diseases including some Avian Viruses and a small amount of Bovine Immunology whilst Pirbright works on exotic (unusual) [[animal diseases]] (usually caused by virus outbreaks). Pirbright has National and International Reference Laboratories of diseases.

===Funding===
25% of its income comes from a core grant from the BBSRC of around £11m.  Around 50% comes from research grants from related government organisations, such as DEFRA, or industry and charities (such as the [[Wellcome Trust]]). The remaining 25% comes from direct payments for work carried out.

==Function==
The Pirbright Institute carries out research, diagnostics and surveillance [[Animal virology|viruses]] carried by animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), African swine fever, bluetongue, lumpy skin disease and avian and swine flu  [[Livestock|farm animal]]s.  Understanding of viruses comes from [[molecular biology]].

It carries out surveillance activities on farm animal health and disease movement in the UK.

== Location ==
The Institute had two sites at:
* [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] in [[Berkshire]] - This was closed in early 2016 and services relocated to Pirbright where new facilities had been constructed.
* [[Pirbright]] in [[Surrey]] — shared with commercial company [[Merial]]

There are two forms of institution-based training for general dentistry available for dental school graduates in [[Australia]]: 
* '''General dental residency''' or '''Dental house officer''', often abbreviated as '''GDR''' and '''DO''' respectively. 
* '''Graduate diploma in clinical dentistry''', often abbreviated as '''GradDipClinDent'''

==Canada==
There are three forms of institution-based training for general dentistry available for dental school graduates in [[Canada]]: 
* '''General practice residency''', often abbreviated as '''GPR'''
* '''Special Enhancement for general dentistry''', often abbreviated as '''SEGD'''
* '''Multidisciplinary training program''', often abbreviated as '''MTP'''

==United States==

There are two forms of institution-based training for general dentistry available for dental school graduates in the [[United States]]:
* '''General practice residency''', often abbreviated as '''GPR'''
* '''Advanced education in general dentistry''', often abbreviated as '''AEGD'''

==United Kingdom==
In the UK, most postgraduate training in dentistry are specialized. Some universities offer postgraduate degrees in general dentistry, with an emphasis on clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/courses/degree/dentistry-dental-sciences Newcastle University - Dentistry and Dental Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program details==
All of the programs below can be 1-year programs with an option available to continue for a second year, or they may be a two-year program from the start.  They allow the new dentist to further hone his or her skills in most of the traditionally defined disciplines of dentistry while at the same time increasing one's speed and refining one's techniques.  These programs also afford trainees the opportunity to learn from the attending dentists who serve a supervisory role, something generally unavailable in private practice.

===AEGD===
While a GPR is a hospital-based program, an AEGD is usually not and the differences between the two types of programs are generally a result of this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sodsc.org/what-iss-the-difference-between-a-gpr-and-an-aegd-programs.html What is the difference between a GPR and an AEGD?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221073126/http://www.sodsc.org/what-iss-the-difference-between-a-gpr-and-an-aegd-programs.html |date=2009-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  AEGDs are usually based in postgraduate dental school clinics.  Both types of programs afford the trainee with a larger patient pool than he or she was exposed to in dental school as an undergraduate; while dental students will typically treat 2 or 3 patients a day in multiple-hour-long sessions, these postgraduate programs are constructed so that trainees may see anywhere from 8-15 patients a day, or even more.  They emphasize restorative dentistry, fixed and removable prosthodontics, orofacial pain, and dental implants.

===DO/GDR===
Both DO and GDR programs are 1-year long commitments and are usually based in a hospital setting.  These programs provide a dentist with a wide range of experiences including  oral surgery, oral pathology, oral medicine, and treating medically compromised patients.

===GPR===
Programs will often emphasize the importance of managing comprehensive dental treatment plans and adjusting them based on the patient's medical condition.  During training, residents may be faced with the task of managing patients that require dentistry in a hospital setting due to a compromised medical condition.  Medical management of dental patients may be emphasized in weekly grand rounds and rotations through [[anesthesia]], [[internal medicine]], and the hospital [[emergency room|emergency department]].  Some programs also provide rotations in family medicine and otolaryngology.  These rotations not only increase the trainee's knowledge and experience, but also allow physicians, resident or attending, to see how dentistry and medicine are related, permitting a better referral relationship in future practices.  This relationship is best demonstrated in tumor boards where both medical and dental residents discuss and treatment plan head and neck cancer patients.  GPR residents may also become familiar with performing dental/oral surgical procedures in the [[operating room]] and managing the patient's stay while in the hospital.  Rotation through the dental specialties increases the resident's ability to handle situations in private practice without referral to a specialist.

===GradDipClinDent===
These programs are usually 1-year in length and are designed very similar in structure to an AEGD program.  Emphasis is placed on restorative dentistry, fixed prosthodontics, removable prosthodontics, orofacial pain, and dental implants.

===SEGD===
Emphasis is on enhanced general practice skills to allow for broader patient care to underserviced areas.  Clinical experience is usually obtained from the residency clinic in the department of dentistry, and during rotations including off site rural experience.

===Multidisciplinary training program===
The goal of the program is to provide the recent dental graduate with a broad multidisciplinary approach to the clinical practice of dentistry.  The postgraduate trainees are thus under the constant supervision and guidance of members of the attending staff.  Experience is gained in general practice and specialties. The specialties represented are: Endodontics, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine, Orthodontics, Periodontics, Prosthodontics and Pediatric Dentistry. 

In general, GPR, DO/GDR, and MPT programs pay higher stipends than do AEGD, SEGD, and GradDipClinDent programs; this is because the former residents take call and answer consults.   While on call, the residents are expected to manage dental as well as some head and neck [[Physical trauma|trauma]] reporting to the ER in accordance with hospital guidelines

'''Quentin Collins''' is the name of several characters featured in the 1966–1971  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] cult [[TV]] [[Gothic horror]]-[[soap opera]] ''[[Dark Shadows]]''. All variations of the character have been played by actor [[David Selby]].

==Quentin I==
The first Quentin Collins is actually the third one shown in the TV series. This version of Quentin was first introduced in episode #1109 in a storyline commonly referred to as the "1840 flashback".

In the 1840 storyline, Quentin Collins was one of two brothers living at the Gothic mansion known as [[Collinwood Mansion]] in the fictional town of [[Collinsport, Maine]]. Born in 1808, as the favorite son of his mentally troubled father Daniel Collins, Quentin was the head of the Collins Family, and stood to inherit the entire family fortune. This position brought him into frequent conflict with his scheming brother, Gabriel (Christopher Pennock). Quentin was married to a woman named Samantha Drew ([[Virginia Vestoff]]), with whom he had a son named Tad (David Henesy).

Around 1839, Quentin had an affair with Joanna Mills.  After he broke off with her, he took Tad on an ocean voyage, on which  Quentin became close friends with a fellow passenger, Gerard Stiles ([[Jim Storm (actor)|James Storm]]).  His wife Samantha eventually discovered the affair and secretly murdered Joanna, making it look as if she had killed herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1970-10-28. Episode 1132] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quentin was interested in the study of witchcraft. He was not part of a witches coven, but is eventually framed by Gerard (who was possessed by the spirit of the 17th-century [[warlock]] Judah Zachery) and sentenced to execution.  Quentin also fancied himself an amateur inventor and used his knowledge of the occult and supernatural powers to develop a device that he called his "Stairway Through Time". He persistently labored to build his staircase in a cellar room at Collinwood. It was Quentin's belief that ascending the staircase could open a dimensional portal through which individuals could view and even interact with the future. What Quentin never realized, however, was that his staircase also created a divergent parallel reality (This functioned as the genesis for several storylines which took place in parallel universes). Quentin's devotion towards his work gave Gerard the means by which to manipulate and ultimately betray him.

In early 1840, Quentin, Tad, and Gerard Stiles had been off at sea for several months. Gerard comes back to Collinwood with the news for Quentin's wife, that her husband and son Tad had been lost at sea.

When Samantha thought that her husband and son were dead, she began spending more and more time with Gerard. Over time, they fell in love, and he asked her to marry. On the day they got married, Quentin returned. He was shocked to discover that his wife had thought him dead, and had married his best friend.

While his wife decided whom she wanted, either him or Gerard; Quentin began having an affair with his son's governess, Daphne Harridge ([[Kate Jackson]]), the sister of Quentin's former lover, Joanna Mills.

Gerard meanwhile had fallen prey to the spirit of a disembodied warlock named Judah Zachary. Judah wanted revenge against the entire Collins family for sentencing him to death for [[witchcraft]] in the late 17th century. Judah's spirit took possession of Gerard Stiles and used him as a secret weapon against the Collins family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1970-11-03. Episode 1137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working alongside a disreputable mortician named Lamar Trask ([[Jerry Lacy]]), who was the son of the 1790s witch hunter Reverend Trask (also played by Lacy), Gerard convinced the local authorities that Quentin was a Satanist and that he had used his knowledge of the dark arts to murder a young woman named Lorna Bell, as well as his own brother-in-law, Randall Drew. Quentin was arrested on charges of Witchcraft and murder, and taken to jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1970-11-30. Episode 1156] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When his ailing father heard the news concerning Quentin's arrest, he changed his will, leaving the entire Collins family fortune to Gerard Stiles.

Quentin was convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to death by beheading. However, with the aid of [[Angelique the Witch|Valerie Collins]] ([[Lara Parker]]), and his cousins Desmond ([[John Karlen]]) and [[Barnabas Collins|Barnabas]] ([[Jonathan Frid]]), Quentin escaped being beheaded. At the last minute, Gerard was shot. At the same moment, the head of Judah Zachary burned up in front of the judge in the case. With its destruction, Gerard was free from the possession and confessed that Quentin was innocent, admitting that Judah was responsible for all the deaths. After asking for forgiveness, Gerard died in Quentin's arms. Quentin having been cleared of all charges, eloped with Daphne Harridge. The two left Collinsport forever to make a new life for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1971-01-26. Episode 1197] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quentin II==
The second Quentin Collins was actually the first one featured in the series, and is arguably the more popular of the two versions among fans, owing primarily to the fact that he is a [[werewolf]]. (When Quentin became a werewolf, the character was played by [[Alex Stevens]].) He was born in 1870, and had three siblings; two brothers, the eldest Edward ([[Louis Edmonds]]), the youngest Carl ([[John Karlen]]), and older sister Judith Collins ([[Joan Bennett]]). He had loved two children like his own, his niece and nephew, Jamison (Henesy) and Nora ([[Denise Nickerson]]). This version of Quentin was the great-nephew of the first Quentin Collins and whose lineage includes several supporting characters peppered throughout the series, including his great-grandchildren Amy (Nickerson), Chris, and Tom Jennings ([[Don Briscoe]]).

This Quentin Collins originally appeared in December 1968 as an angry, silent, malevolent spirit haunting the playroom in the west wing of Collinwood (along with the ghost of his lover Beth Chavez).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1968-12-16. Episode 646] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quentin and Beth's spirits befriended the children David Collins (Henesy) and his friend and distant cousin, Amy Jennings. David strongly resembled Jamison Collins. Eventually, they took possession of both children and used them to serve their own interests.

In an effort to save his family, the former vampire known as [[Barnabas Collins]], used the cosmological principles of the [[I Ching]] to send his spirit backwards through time to the year 1897 (Unfortunately for Barnabas, this meant becoming a vampire once again as such was his physical state during that time period). This series of episodes is commonly referred to as the "1897 flashback".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-03-03. Episode 701] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first Quentin, the second also was secretly involved in the occult and practiced witchcraft. He was a member of a witches coven headed by his best friend, the Collins family lawyer Evan Hanley (Humbert Allen Astredo).

In 1897, Quentin had earned himself a reputation of being the black sheep of the family – due largely in part to his marriage and subsequent abuse of a girl named Jenny (Marie Wallace). Quentin's affair with his brother Edward's wife Laura ([[Diana Millay]]), and his running off to Egypt with Laura resulted in Jenny Collins going insane. While Quentin was away, Jenny had two babies, a boy and a girl. Along with Beth Chavez, Edward and Judith Collins conspired to keep Jenny hidden from the rest of the family by imprisoning her inside of the tower room at Collinwood. Edward and Judith wanted to keep any knowledge of the babies from their father and the rest of the world. To that end they gave Jenny's children to Ms. Filmore in Collinsport, who would raise the children as her own. Amy, Chris, and Tom Jennings are descendant from the female child (Lenore Filmore).

When Quentin returned from Egypt in the spring of 1897, his wife was nowhere to be found. He turned his attention to his grandmother Edith Collins (Isabella Hoopes), who was ill and near death. Quentin hoped that she would leave the Collins wealth and control of Collinwood to him. When she dies, in an attempt to make that hope a reality, Quentin had Jamison Collins steal the will from the lining of Edith Collins' coffin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-03-12. Episode 708] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The will left everything to Edith's favorite, Edward. Quentin was only guaranteed a room at Collinwood for the rest of his life, but given no money. So Quentin went so far as to have Evan Hanley get Sandor Racosi ([[Thayer David]]) to make a fake will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-03-14. Episode 710] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quentin was being haunted by the ghost of Edith, and thought that Barnabas Collins was plotting against him. Being suspicious of his mysterious cousin from England, and believing he would try to interfere in his plans, Quentin and Hanley did a [[black magic]] ritual asking for help to defeat their enemies. Using the innocence of his young nephew Jamison as a focal point, they manage to summon a powerful spirit. The ritual resurrected from Hell the powerful witch Angelique (Lara Parker).

Barnabas Collins stole the fake will, and had Sandor now under his vampiric control to change it, leaving everything to Judith Collins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''.

Quentin had Jamison steal Barnabas’s cane which he then uses in a ritual to cause Barnabas great pain. Had Barnabas been mortal instead of a vampire, the ritual would have killed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]].

Soon after, Quentin's insane wife Jenny escaped from the tower room and stabbed Quentin to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]].

However, Angelique was jealous of Barnabas latest love interest Rachel Drummond. So she turned Quentin into a zombie, and had him try to take Rachel back to the grave with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]].

Due to Jamison's strange behavior of acting like Quentin, Edward Collins decides to send Jamison and Nora to the Worthington Hall Boarding School operated by Reverend Gregory Trask.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-04-04.

Yet, Barnabas was able to save Rachel. Reverend Trask's prayer was apparently answered when Quentin was restored to life, and Jamison was no longer possessed by Quentin, although Angelique was apparently the one that actually used her powers to do it for her own reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-04-07.

After returning from the dead, Quentin had increased paranoia about Jenny trying to kill him again. It was at this time that Magda ([[Grayson Hall]]) and Sandor Racosi (Thayer David) discovered that Jenny was still alive. It turns out that she was Magda's sister, a gypsy that had run away from home and married Quentin. None of the Collins family had known that she was a gypsy, so it was a shock to Judith, Edward, and the rest of the family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''.

Magda threatened to curse Quentin if he did anything more to hurt her sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-05-05.

When Jenny catches Quentin and Beth kissing, she attacks him with a knife. In self-defense he kills Jenny. With the help of his brother Edward, in order to protect the Collins name, Jenny's death is covered up as an accidental fall down the stairs. Magda finds a button from Quentin's suit in Jenny's hand, and can easily tell that Jenny didn't die from a fall, but was strangled. So she makes plans to curse Quentin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-05-07.

Quentin, believing that he was already cursed, and thinking he was haunted by the ghost of Jenny, went to Magda and tried to persuade her to lift the curse. His sister Judith gave him $10,000, in return for Quentin signing away his right to live at Collinwood. Magda and Sandor took the money, and said the curse was lifted, having a drink to the agreement. Then Magda threw the money back at him and informed Quentin that the drink he had just consumed contained the curse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-05-08. Episode 749] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quentin soon discovered that he had inherited a curse that transformed him into a werewolf whenever the moon was full. He had no memory of what he did as a werewolf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-05-12. Episode 751] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation itself was painful and unbearable for Quentin. He was tormented by the blood of innocent victims he found on himself the morning after. Barnabas, sympathetic to Quentin's plight, tried to help him overcome the curse, but to no avail. He did, however, succeed in altering Quentin’s destiny, preventing the creation of the future timeline where Quentin’s spirit plagued Collinwood.

Quentin felt hopeless and contemplated suicide as the only way out. But Magda, having discovered that she had not only cursed Quentin, but also her sister Jenny's children for all eternity, decided to try to help find a cure for Quentin. Magda had heard of a magical hand possessed by a gypsy tribe controlled by King Johnny Romano. Magda went away to find the magical hand of Count Petofi and stole it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-06-02. Episode 766] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to Collinwood, with the hand, in hopes of lifting the werewolf curse from Quentin and his first-born male descendants. However, the hand's powers were uncontrollable, and it did as it pleased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-06-18. Episode 778] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the powerful warlock [[Andreas Petofi|Count Petofi]], and his servant Aristede arrived in Collinsport, looking for his all-powerful hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-07-09. Episode 793] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After causing much trouble for the Collins family by possessing Jamison Collins with his own spirit, Petofi pressured Barnabas and Quentin to yield the magical hand. Barnabas and Quentin felt compelled to do so or risk Jamison dying, and with him the entire future of the Collins family. So they gave Petofi back his hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-08-07. Episode 814] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reverend Gregory Trask had become suspicious of Quentin and his strange behavior. He discovered Quentin with chains in his room, and Quentin confessed that he was the werewolf, and wanted to be killed. Trask, wanting to make sure Quentin was the werewolf, took him to a cell in the basement, and waited for the moon. Yet, Quentin didn't change that night. Upon arriving back at his room, he met Count Petofi, who showed Quentin his portrait, and that it had changed into the werewolf instead of him. Petofi said he would expect the debt of curing Quentin to be paid at some point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-09-01. Episodes 831-833] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the portrait cure Quentin of lycanthropy, but he was also rendered immortal due to the efforts of the artist Charles Delaware Tate ([[Roger Davis (television actor)|Roger Davis]]), whose powers were a gift of Count Petofi. In a pastiche of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', at the request of Count Petofi, Tate painted a portrait of Quentin Collins. So long as the portrait remained intact, Quentin would remain forever young, and the portrait would change into the werewolf instead of Quentin himself.

Quentin soon discovered that the price Count Petofi expected to be paid was his now immortal body. Count Petofi wanted to escape the gypsies, who wanted his powerful hand for themselves. Petofi used his powers to swap bodies with Quentin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-10-06.

However, something went wrong with Petofi's spell. The powers returned to the hand in his old body. Quentin used the powers of the hand to reverse the body swap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-10-31.

Quentin was still alive and wandering the streets of Collinsport by the year 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darkshadows.com/main.html ''Dark Shadows''. [[Dan Curtis]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. 1969-12-12. Episode 904] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007003926/http://darkshadows.com/main.html |date=2006-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An amnesiac calling himself Grant Douglas, he reunited with Barnabas Collins and soon regained his true memories. He worked closely alongside Barnabas and his trusted companion Dr. Julia Hoffman (Grayson Hall), and aided them against the likes of Angelique and the Cult of the Leviathans.

During this time, Quentin discovered that his lycanthropy had passed along his family line, affecting his descendant Chris Jennings (Chris' twin brother, Tom, ironically enough became a vampire).

==''Night of Dark Shadows''==
In 1971, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released ''[[Night of Dark Shadows]]'', a sequel to the 1970 film ''[[House of Dark Shadows]]''. Although both films presumably share continuity with one another, they exist independently of the television series. Once again, David Selby resumed the role of Quentin Collins as well as that of his character’s ancestor, Charles Collins. In ''Night of Dark Shadows'', Quentin Collins is an artist who inherits Collinwood after the passing of the last remaining family member, [[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]].

Along with his wife Tracy ([[Kate Jackson]]), Quentin becomes the victim of [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique]] – a witch who died over a century ago. Angelique's spirit operates in tandem with that of her 19th century lover, Charles Collins and slowly subverts Quentin's will. Before long, Quentin's soul is consumed by the evil of Charles Collins and he begins stalking his wife and friends.

==''Dark Shadows'' audio drama==
Based on a stage play performed at a ''Dark Shadows'' convention, ''Return to Collinwood'' is an audio drama written by David Selby's son, Jamison Selby and Jim Pierson centered around Quentin Collins return to Collinwood. It starred most of the original cast, including David Selby (Quentin Collins), Kathryn Leigh Scott (Maggie Evans), John Karlen (Willie Loomis), Nancy Barrett (Carolyn), Lara Parker (Angelique), and many more.

In 2006, [[Big Finish Productions]] continued the ''Dark Shadows'' saga with an original series of audio dramas, starring most of the original cast, with the addition of David Selby's son Jamison, and other talented voice actors. Like ''Return to Collinwood'', Quentin Collins is the central character, and the first season dealt with Quentin's return to Collinwood, and his attempts to re-establish the Collins family.

The first season comprises four discs, featuring David Selby (Quentin Collins), Lara Parker (Angelique), Kathryn Leigh Scott (Maggie Evans), and John Karlen (Willie Loomis). More information and online ordering can be found at [https://www.bigfinish.com/hubs/v/dark-shadows].

A magical portrait changed into the werewolf on the three nights of the full moon instead of Quentin.
* Eternal youth, due to magical portrait of him, painted in 1897.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''Registered Dental Nurse''' (RDN) works as part of a dental team in a variety of clinical and non-clinical settings. From 30 July 2008, all qualified Dental Nurses in the UK must be registered with the [[General Dental Council]] (GDC) to continue working legally and must hold the NEBDN National Diploma or another recognised qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Qualifications ==
The most up-to-date recognised qualifications that lead to registering with the GDC are specified by the [[General Dental Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dental nursing|url=https://www.gdc-uk.org/professionals/education/recent-inspections/inspections-dental-nursing|publisher=General Dental Council (UK)|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dental hospitals and [[Further education|further education colleges]] run courses on a full-time and [[Part time|part-time]] basis.

A small proportion of student Dental Nurses start their career in a hospital. They will attend lectures, usually at a school of dental nursing several times a week. Their practical experience is gained from placements on specialists clinics within the hospital, before qualifying.

==Professional associations in the UK==
[[File:British Association of Dental Nurses.png|thumb]]

The [[British Association of Dental Nurses]] is the professional organisation representing dental nurses in the UK – whether qualified or unqualified, working in General Practice, hospital, community, the armed forces, industry, practice management or reception. This Association supports dental nurses themselves and represents the interests of Dental Nurses at all levels. BADN Executive Committee is made up of dental nurses elected by the members.

The National Dental Nursing Conference, held each year, provides an opportunity for members of the dental team to meet with colleagues, socialise and further their professional education. The Conference is held in a different location each year. Current BADN members receive a discount on Conference registration fees.

BADN members in all categories have access to the digital quarterly journal “The British Dental Nurses’ Journal”. In addition, members have access to the legal helpline, as well as information and support, a members only area of the BADN website, and a range of discounts and special offers. 

Full membership is available with or without indemnity cover. Student Associate e-membership is also available to Student Dental Nurses on or awaiting a place on a recognised course.

'''Retinal vasculitis''' is inflammation of the vascular branches of the [[retinal artery]], caused either by primary ocular disease processes, or as a specific presentation of any systemic form of [[vasculitis]] such as [[Behçet's disease]], [[sarcoidosis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], or any form of [[Systemic disease|systemic]] nectrozing vasculitis such as [[temporal arteritis]], [[polyarteritis nodosa]], and [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], or due to [[lupus erythematosus]], or [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref name=it&gt;{{cite web|title=Retinal Vasculitis|author=Lynn K.

==Symptoms==
Retinal vasculitis presents as painless, decrease of visual acuity (blurry vision), visual [[floaters]], [[scotomas]] (dark spot in vision), decreased ability to distinguish colors, and [[metamorphopsia]] (distortion of images such as linear images).&lt;ref name=it /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Retinal vasculitis is very rare as the only presenting symptom. Often there is sufficient systemic evidence to help the physician decide between any one of the aforementioned possible systemic diseases. For those patients who present with only vasculitis of the retinal vessels, great investigative effort (Chest X-ray, blood test, urinary analysis, vascular biopsy, ophthalmology assessment, etc.) should be undertaken to ensure that a systemic disease is not the hidden culprit.
===Findings===
Ophthalmic examination may reveal [[neovascularization]] (creation of new vessels in the retina), retinal vessel narrowing, retinal vessel cuffing, retinal hemorrhage, or possible vitritis (inflammation of the [[vitreous body]]) or choroiditis (inflammation of the [[choroid]]).&lt;ref name=it /&gt;

'''Sampada Gramin Mahila Sanstha (SANGRAM)''' is a voluntary organization that was co-founded by activist [[Meena Seshu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rewire.news/article/2010/07/25/work-sangram-workers-claiming-their-rights|title=The Work of Sangram: Sex Workers Claiming Their Rights|last=Ray|first=Audacia|date=2010-07-25|work=Rewire.News|access-date=2018-06-01|last2=Correspondent|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It works at the [[grassroots]] level with activists, volunteers and paid workers. It is slowly gaining importance as a practical training ground for other NGO’s and GO’s interested in working on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in a [[rural]] context. SANGRAM started its work with women in [[prostitution]] and [[sex worker|sex work]] from South [[Maharashtra]] and [[North Karnataka]] in 1992 and has since fanned out among diverse populations. SANGRAM is based in [[Sangli district]], which has the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in Maharashtra after [[Mumbai]]. 

==The peer intervention==
One settlement in one town: from this small beginning in 1992, the peer education programme has grown to span six districts in Maharashtra and the border areas of North Karnataka. About 120 peer educators drop off 350,000 [[condom]]s to 5,500 women each month. These women include [[devadasi]]s, [[streetwalker]]s, and [[housewife|housewives]] in sex work, "flying" sex workers working in different locations, [[brothel]] keepers, PLHA etc.

The locations that the [[peer education]] programme spans are as diverse as the women themselves. They range from small hutments to sturdy homes in industrial centres like [[Karad]], where household women turn to prostitution and sex work on market days. They include textile towns like [[Ichalkaranji]], popularly known as the Manchester of India, and truck stops like Pethnaka on national highway no 4, where women from nearby villages work from midnight to dawn. They cover ''dhabas'' and cloth cabins, brothels and lodges.

Unlike programmes that view sex workers as carriers of HIV, SANGRAM’s peer education programme sees a woman in prostitution and sex work as an individual who can be empowered to become an agent of change for herself and her community. This vision is based on two underlying premises:

* Insiders are more effective than outsiders in reaching the community
* Women in prostitution and sex work can reliably enforce condom use for their own protection

It frames HIV within a context of sexuality, gender and rights. For instance, condoms are viewed as life-saving equipment that women in prostitution and sex work must have access to – by right. Workers are trained on issues such as law, inheritance, property rights and other gendered issues related to HIV.

==VAMP==
When the [[peer education]] programme began in 1992, it was run by SANGRAM. Since 1996, the peer intervention has been run by VAMP, a collective of women in prostitution and sex work. As part of its responsibilities, VAMP runs and manages the peer intervention in the six districts where it began: [[Sangli district|Sangli]], [[Satara district|Satara]], [[Kolhapur District|Kolhapur]], [[Solapur district|Solapur]], [[Bagalkot district|Bagalkot]], [[Belgaum district|Belgaum]]. “Once VAMP was formed, we actually decided to close down SANGRAM.” But the women perceived it as abandonment. “They would tell us, 'Because we are sex workers, you want us to form our own organization and work on our own,' recalls SANGRAM staff.

VAMP members – all of whom are women in prostitution and sex work – said they felt comfortable managing the community on their own, but needed help with back-office work: writing proposals, managing accounts, dealing with the Charity Commissioner etc. “We will manage the community at all levels and only come to you in a crisis,” VAMP members told SANGRAM staff. It was then decided that the two organizations should collaborate – with each bringing its strengths and meeting the other’s needs.

Women in prostitution and sex work are champions at orally keeping track of money and handling salary and other disbursals – but putting it on paper is another story. “The women are scared of paperwork.” “They need to learn that they don’t need to be scared – but this is an alien space for them.” An earlier attempt to train the women did not work. “The energy dipped.” Now, for each project that VAMP runs, its members select a co-ordinator who will put their words on paper.

Reading, writing, and doing paperwork is a need that women in prostitution and sex work often need help with, simply because many of them have never been to school. But not being able to read or write does not mean that they cannot think. Working from its philosophy of building capacities, SANGRAM proposed a unique solution to the paperwork problem:

* Women in prostitution and sex work would record their day-to-day work and accounts by dictating these to literate people in their own community – clients, sons, daughters, and colleagues.
* A person trusted and identified by VAMP members would be appointed as co-ordinator. Raju Naik, the person who the women chose, is the son of a sex worker. He is the first male co-ordinator of VAMP, and his salary is split between VAMP and SANGRAM.

'''Sandow''' is the highest village of Chiktan block, situated {{convert|60|km|mi}} away in the east of district headquarter [[Kargil]] Ladakh (''[[Jammu and Kashmir ]]''). Sandow is surrounded by villages-Lamsoo in the west, Yokma Kharboo and Shakar in the south and Lhalung Batalik in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inmap.in/Yokma%20Kharboo/Shakar-chiktan/Kargil/Jammu%20and%20Kashmir|title=Yokma Kharboo|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandow falls under Shakar constituency zone. The village is {{convert|58|km|mi}} from Kargil town, located on 34.55 latitude and 76.38 longitude and at an altitude of {{convert|3200|m|ft}} above mean sea level. The village was settled some around 300 years before, on a syncline of a complex range of Himalaya.

== Climate ==
Sandow has very cool climate with temperature dropping to {{convert|-30|C}} in winter. Very cool normal wind makes life harsh there in winter. In summer temperature rises to 20. Three main seasons i.e. spring, autumn and winter are very cold. In winter snowfall of over 1 feet will be there which is the main source of water for the summer. There is a large like namely Shashi Lake 2&amp;nbsp;km above the village which stores snow water melted in spring and early summer to ensure continuous water supply for the whole summer.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture is very important and main work of the villagers. Crops like Barley, wheat and pea are cultivated. Agricultural works begins in mid-April until August. There are canals to water fields as there used to be very less rainfall. Until a few years back all agricultural works like ploughing, threshing, grinding to flour are used to be done by peoples with help of animals but now machines replaced grinding and threshing.

==== Topography====
[[File:Sandow in winter.jpg|thumb|Sandow in winter|381x381px]]
Sandow is in between mountains and is very rugged. Small agricultural fields are made in the mountains alongside the stream. Soil here is not productive, basically soil is very new, formed by degradation and erosion of mountains peoples have made the soil cultivable by fediing the soil with local manures whole village and field are in slope of mountains.

==== Education ====
There is a middle school in the village. Literacy rate of the village is above 80% and most of the students are pursuing their higher studies in various parts of India. A secondary school is located {{convert|10|km|mi}} away from the village in another village Shakar.

==== Population ====
There are about 40 households in the villages and population is roughly 400.

[[File:Shashi Tso ( Lake ).jpg|thumb]]
Shashi Lake (popularly known as Shashi Tso)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amanrajimages.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/shashi-tso-kargil-ii-ladakh-ii/|title=SHASHI TSO (KARGIL) II LADAKH II|date=2015-06-29|website=AMAN RAJ|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the unexplored lakes of [[Kargil district|Kargil]] located 08&amp;nbsp;km from village Sandow. It is a beautiful artificial lake located in upper mountain range of Shashi at an altitude of 4,200&amp;nbsp;metres (14,000&amp;nbsp;ft) surrounded by mountains on all sides. The lake is snow fed so its volume changes with seasons reaching at peak volume in June. The lake remains in frozen state for half of the year. The Lake is seasonal and it gets filled up in Months of May–June when snow starts to melt in the surrounding mountains. It is famous for its scenic beauty, cool weather, fresh icy water and adventures like Kayaking and trekking. It is base camp for trekking to Barbanchanla peak which is the highest peak of [http://inmap.in/Shakar-chiktan/Kargil/Jammu%20and%20Kashmir Shakar-Chiktan]. The area surrounding the lake are grazing grounds for livestock of surrounding villagers and wild animals like fox, deer, ibex, wolves etc. could be seen around the lake drinking water.

=== Construction ===
This lake was constructed about 60 years back by the villagers of twin village of Sandow and Yokma Kharboo with the purpose of permanent water source for the agricultural land in the two villages which lies along the stream originating from the lake. A wall was constructed on lower side of the lake to stop the water and regulatory water gateway was made to allow water to flow in case overfilled. A required amount of water leak from the base of the wall which makes it independent, requiring no human to regulate the flowing water level from the lake.The wall was constructed with a slope varying from 40 degrees at bottom to 60 degrees at top and one can easily walk even on the slanting wall of the lake.It was constructed without use of any cement, concrete and iron and this adds to the wonder of visitors.

=== Excursions and tourism ===
The Lake is connected with road to Sandow  and lalung and one can reach there through both the roads from Kargil. Through Sandow it is connected to National highway (NH1) at Khangral and Lotsum. It is 65&amp;nbsp;km from district headquarter Kargil and 200&amp;nbsp;km from Leh. From last few years (after linking it with road to Sandow) thousands of peoples are flooding to the lake for picnic in summer mainly in the month of July and August. Nowadays it has become a favourite picnic spot  for peoples of the region and school children.  2015 alone saw a footfall of more than 10 thousand with locals mainly staying a day long while most foreign tourists stayed for many days and explored the surrounding areas like Trekking to Barbanchan la and trip to mysterious Api Strinjangmo-e-Baho (roughly translated as Old Spider's cave).

=== In news ===
In 2015 the lake drew attention from administration when due to overfilling and resulting leakages damaging low lying areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jammu-kashmir/community/now-breach-in-shahsi-lake-poses-threat-to-kargil-residents/79212.html|title=The Tribune India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reachladakh.com/another-phuktal-like-situation-at-shahsi-lake-kargil/2844.html|title=reachladakh.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElmwoodCollege.JPG|thumb|right|SRUC's Elmwood Campus in Cupar, Fife]]

'''Scotland's Rural College''' (SRUC) is a [[higher education]] institution that combines education, consulting and research in [[Scotland]]. It focuses on [[agriculture]].  It was founded in October 2012 through a merger of [[Barony College]], [[Elmwood College]], [[Oatridge College]] and the [[Scottish Agricultural College]] (SAC).

The institution will work towards gaining the status of a [[university college]] with degree awarding powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sruc.ac.uk/news/article/158/sruc_launch_strengthens_support_for_agriculture_and_rural_sector |title=SRUC Launch Strengthens Support for Agriculture and Rural Sector |date=2 October 2012 |publisher=SRUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until such time, the initialism SRUC is given as the organisation's name to avoid a reference to university college status.&lt;ref&gt;SRUC Boards and Committees Remits and Structures document, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; SRUC is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under Scottish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC003712|SRUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees are currently awarded by [[The University of Edinburgh]] and [[The University of Glasgow]] depending on the campus.

SRUC students study land-based courses on sites throughout Scotland from further education to PhD level. The organisation’s Research Division carries out research in the agriculture and rural sector while the Consulting Division, SAC Consulting, works with more than 12,000 clients in rural businesses and associated industries. The college has six campuses across Scotland while the Consulting arm has 26 offices located both in Scotland and in the north of England, as well as eight veterinary surveillance centres. SRUC’s Research Division operates in six research centres, and SRUC also runs eight farms for both research and educational purposes.

==History==
Scotland’s Rural College‘s heritage stretches back more than 100 years through many smaller institutions which have merged. The current organisation came into being on 1 October 2012 after [[land-based college]]s Barony, Elmwood and Oatridge merged with the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/192670-agricultural-colleges-merge-to-create-training-hub-for-rural-industries/ |title=Agricultural colleges merge to create training hub for rural industries |work=[[STV News]] |date=1 October 2012 |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Barony College===
Before it became a college the 300 acre Barony estate had a varied existence. It was an elegant home, a home for the elderly, a wartime army training camp and, up until 1947, a prisoner of war camp. In 1949 Dumfries County Council Education Department purchased the estate with the purpose of turning it into an agricultural school. The Barony Farm School opened in 1953, with a class 46 boys of 14 to 15 years of age.

Day release classes in general agriculture and agricultural engineering began 1962, and ten years later the school became the Barony Agricultural College. The 70s and 80s saw the range of courses on offer expand to include National Certificates in agriculture, fish farming, forestry, countryside rangers, horticulture, animal care, veterinary nursing and equine studies. By this time most students at the college were studying full-time.

A new teaching block complete with a large sports hall, a multigym and a bar was opened in 1992. The new millennium brought massive investment in Animal Care and Veterinary Nursing, an Equine Unit and a Forestry Technology Centre. The Dairy Technology Centre was opened in 2006, complete with a robotic milking system.

===Elmwood College===
While Elmwood College did not officially open its doors until 1972, its foundations were laid 20 years earlier holding classes in the local school and cricket club before Fife County Council Education Committee acquired some land and erected a [[Nissen hut]]. This was followed by the purchase of the adjacent property of Elmwood House, Gardens and Greenhouses in 1953 for the sum of £2,300.

In 1956 the first day release classes in Scotland for agricultural and horticultural apprentices commenced at Elmwood Agricultural Centre. Elmwood College continued to expand during the early 1960s and this culminated in the construction of a new building, completed in 1972. By then Elmwood had also acquired Stratheden Hospital Farm. The College was officially opened in 1972 by Sir Hector Munro.

Elmwood is well known for its golf education and construction of the golf course began in 1995 with special attention being given to both the quality of the course and consideration of the local environment. Opened in 1997 the Elmwood course was Geo Certified in 2013; this environmental plaudit is only awarded to courses which prove they are working as sustainably as possible.

===The Scottish Agricultural College===
Three agricultural colleges were created in the east, north and west of Scotland around the close of the 19th century. They fulfilled a critical need to transfer the growing scientific knowledge of agricultural issues like soil condition, drainage, use of manures and animal diseases, to farmers and the general public. In 1899 the agricultural department of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College amalgamated with the Scottish Dairy Institute and formed the West of Scotland Agricultural College. Originally based in Glasgow, the organisation began moving to Ayrshire when in 1927 the [[Auchincruive]] estate was left to the College by John Hannah of Girvan Mains.

The Edinburgh and East of Scotland College of Agriculture was formed in 1901 and grew so rapidly its premises in the city’s George Square had to be expanded in 1904. In 1913 they formed a Joint Committee on Research in Animal Breeding with the [[University of Edinburgh]].

North of Scotland College of Agriculture (NOSCA) began in 1904 in Aberdeen through grants from ten benefactors including most of the local councils nearby. In 1914 it moved to the Craibstone Estate, which is still a campus today.

In 1990 these three major agricultural colleges merged to form the [[Scottish Agricultural College]] (SAC). SAC’s three main divisions offered research, education and consultancy.

==Campuses==
SRUC has six campuses located throughout Scotland, each offering varied land-based education courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sruc.ac.uk/info/120169/campuses_and_offices |title=Campuses and Offices |accessdate=22 January 2013|publisher=SRUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aberdeen Campus is based on Craibstone Estate about {{convert|5|mi}} outside [[Aberdeen]] in the north east of Scotland. As well as halls of residence and a library, the campus also boasts many sporting opportunities with an Astroturf pitch, a gym, sauna and steam room and a golf course. Courses on offer in Aberdeen include agriculture, organic farming and countryside and environmental management.

The Ayr campus is shared with students from the [[University of the West of Scotland]]. The £81 million facility was opened in September 2011 and was awarded the internationally recognised [[BREEAM]] Excellence rating for its environmentally friendly design. As well as student accommodation, the campus has a library and a diverse range of sporting activities, including climbing and horse riding, are available. Courses on offer in Ayr include Agricultural Bioscience and Green Technology.

Barony Campus is set in a working {{convert|260|ha|km2}} estate in [[Dumfries and Galloway]] in south west Scotland. As well as the usual student facilities such as library and accommodation, the campus is home to the Scottish Dairy technology Centre and the Scottish Forestry Technology Centre. Courses on offer at Barony include animal care, equine studies and forestry and arboriculture.

Edinburgh campus - Located on the south side of the capital this campus is shared with the [[University of Edinburgh]]. This allows students to access the university’s facilities, both academic and recreational, as well as SRUC’s. As well as libraries and cafes the campus also has sporting amenities and is just a ten-minute bus journey from the city centre. Courses on offer in Edinburgh include horticulture, applied animal science and rural resource management.

SRUC Elmwood is based in Cupar, a small town in [[Fife]] approximately nine miles from [[St Andrews]]. As well having as a professional golf course, students have the opportunity to play badminton, table tennis and football, or work out in the gym. Courses on offer at Elmwood include conservation, greenkeeping and gamekeeping.

Situated in [[West Lothian]], SRUC’s Oatridge Campus is set on a large estate which includes a working farm. As well as a student accommodation and a library, there is also a nine-hole golf course, and the campus is home to the [[Scottish National Equestrian Centre]] (SNEC). Courses on offer at Oatridge include [[farriery]] and forge work, and land-based engineering.

==Academic profile==
{{As of|2012|October}}, the combined college had around 8,000 students and 1,500 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/comment-new-rural-education-power-takes-to-the-european-stage-1-2556575 |title=Comment: New rural education power takes to the European stage | first=Andrew |last=Arbuckle |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=1 October 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, after two years with a principal, SRUC appointed Professor Wayne Powell to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/farming/wayne-powell-appointed-as-new-sruc-principal-1-4112080 |title=Wayne Powell appointed as new SRUC principal | first=Andrew |last=Arbuckle |work=The Scotsman |date=27 April 2016 |accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The further education and degree programmes at Scotland’s Rural College are grouped into six main departments: Agriculture and Business Management, Animal and Equine, Engineering, Science and Technology, Environment and Countryside, Horticulture and Landscape, and Sport and Tourism.

Students can study at all levels – from access courses and vocational studies, through undergraduate programmes covering [[Higher National Certificate|HNC]], [[Higher National Diploma|HND]] and undergraduate degree courses, to taught postgraduate programmes and PhDs.

==Research==
SRUC Research seeks to address major challenges posed by the growing human population, and increasing demand for food, in a world with a potentially dramatically changing climate and with growing pressure on its natural resources. SRUC Research aims to benefit the rural economy and rural communities and enhance their environment.

SRUC’s Research Division is divided into four interdisciplinary research groups; each of which are devoted to different, often overlapping, areas of land-based research.

*Animal Health and Veterinary Science Group: This group is focused on animal science and in particular; genetics, genomics, animal behaviour and welfare, nutrition, disease and epidemiology.
*Crop and Soil Systems Research Group: This group’s hopes to help develop resilient and sustainable systems of crop production that are economically viable, but also environmentally and socially acceptable.
*Future Farming Systems Research Group: This group aims to understand and engage with farmers and so help improve farming systems both nationally and internationally.
*Land Economy, Environment and Society Research Group: This group’s research aims to improve the economic, environmental and social sustainability of rural areas.

'''Sylva Macharová''' (23 June 1893 – 19 January 1968) was a Czech nurse who was one of the first trained nurses in [[Prague]]. She headed the first nursing school in the country between 1923 and 1931. She was one of the inaugural recipients of the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]]. After a break to raise her family, Macharová returned to nursing after [[World War II]], working at a military hospital until 1949. Thereafter, she was appointed Head of the Rehabilitation Department in the private clinic of Professor Jirásek.

==Early life==
Sylva Macharová was born on 23 June 1893 in [[Vienna]], which was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at that time.{{sfn|Vašíčková|2007|p=7}} Her father was the Czech poet [[Josef Svatopluk Machar]],{{sfn|Pistulková|2007|p=19}} who at the time of her birth was working as a bank clerk.{{sfn|Institute of Czech Literature|n.d.}} After attending the Lyceum in [[Hradec Králové]] for her secondary schooling,{{sfn|Kutnohorská|2010|pp=75-76}} Macharová enrolled in 1913{{sfn|Vašíčková|2007|p=7}} in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolfinerhaus|de}} Hospital School of Nursing in Vienna. She graduated in 1915 and went to [[Prague]],{{sfn|Kutnohorská|2010|pp=75-76}} becoming one of the first licensed nurses of the city.{{sfn|Langhans|2005}}

==Career==
Macharová, who spoke Czech, English, and German, began working in a sanatorium in [[Podolí (Prague)|Podolí]]. Soon thereafter, she became a [[Perioperative nursing|scrub nurse]] in the clinic of Professor Kukuly.{{sfn|Pistulková|2007|p=19}} Around 1918, Macharová went to [[Zlín]] at the request of [[Tomáš Baťa]], founder of [[Bata Shoes]], who was the mayor of Zlín at that time. He wanted her to investigate why they had cases of wound [[suppuration]] and she was able to discover the cause.{{sfn|Vašíčková|2007|p=7}} In 1920, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] awarded the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]] for the first time, and Macharová was one of two Czech recipients, the other being Irene Metekickova. The award was designed to recognize those who exhibited exemplary performance of nursing duties.{{sfn|''The British Journal of Nursing''|1920|p=334}}

In 1923, Macharová became the first headmistress of the Czechoslovakian School of Nursing, taking over from the three [[American Red Cross]] nurses who had initially developed the theoretical and practical training for the school.{{sfn|Pistulková|2007|p=9}} Simultaneously, she became the director of the German Nursing School in the city.{{sfn|Langhans|2005}} During her tenure, the school expanded rapidly, but maintained its dedication to professionalism.{{sfn|Pistulková|2007|p=19}} Macharová developed internship opportunities and workshops to improve skill and she sought to integrate languages in both schools.{{sfn|Vašíčková|2007|p=23}}

In 1931, Macharová married Alfonse Novacek, a [[veterinarian]]. They moved to [[Moravské Budějovice]],{{sfn|Langhans|2005}} where Macharová raised two sons, until 1938. At that time, the family returned to Prague because Marcharová's father was ill.{{sfn|Pistulková|2007|p=19}} In 1946, she returned to nursing, working at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Central Military Hospital|cs|3=Ústřední vojenská nemocnice}}, which was often referred to as the Střešovická Hospital, due to its nearness to [[Střešovice]].{{sfn|Pistulková|2007|p=20}} She worked in the [[neurosurgery]] unit until 1949, when for political reasons she was forced to resign.{{sfn|Langhans|2005}} That same year, she was hired as the she head of the Rehabilitation Department in the private clinic of Professor Jiráska, where she worked until her retirement in 1957.{{sfn|Pistulková|2007|p=20}}

Macharová died after a lengthy bout with cancer on 19 January 1968.{{sfn|Pistulková|2007|p=20}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3028">The '''Texas Medication Algorithm Project''' ('''TMAP''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/mhprograms/TMAPtoc.shtm DSHS.state.tx.us] - Texas Medication Algorithm Project&lt;/ref&gt; is a controversial decision-tree [[medical algorithm]], the design of which was based on the expert opinions of mental health specialists. It has provided and rolled out a set of [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] management guidelines for doctors treating certain mental disorders within [[Texas|Texas']] publicly funded [[mental health]] care system, along with manuals relating to each of them.  The algorithms commence after diagnosis and cover pharmacological treatment (hence "Medication Algorithm").

==History==
TMAP was initiated in the fall of 1997 and the initial research covered around 500 patients.

TMAP arose from a collaboration that began in 1995 between the [[Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation]] (TDMHMR), [[pharmaceutical]] companies, and the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas|University of Texas Southwestern]].  The research was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Meadows Foundation, the Lightner-Sams Foundation, the Nanny Hogan Boyd Charitable Trust, TDMHMR, the Center for Mental Health Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Health Services Research and Development Research Career Scientist Award, the United States Pharmacopoeia Convention Inc. and Mental Health Connections.

Numerous companies that invent and develop antipsychotic medications provided use of their medications and furnished funding for the project. Companies did not participate in the production of the guidelines. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahrp.org/infomail/05/10/14.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 TMAP was mentioned as an example of a successful project in a paper regarding implementing mental health screening programs throughout the [[United States]], by the President [[George W. Bush| George W. Bush's ]]  [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]], which looks to expand the program federally.  The President had previously been Governor of Texas, in the period when TMAP was implemented.  Similar programs have been implemented in about a dozen States, according to a 2004 report in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.

Similar algorithms with similar prescribing advice have been produced elsewhere, for instance at the [[Maudsley Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhc.com/Algorithms/AlgoLinks.HTML] Lists of Psychopharmacology Algorithms.  Compiled by David N. Osser, M.D. and Robert D. Patterson, M.D.  (viewed 17 March 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; London.

'''Video self-modeling''' ('''VSM''') is a form of [[observational learning]] in which individuals observe themselves performing a [[behavior]] successfully on [[video]], and then [[Imitation|imitate]] the targeted behavior. VSM allows individuals to view themselves being successful, acting appropriately, or performing new tasks. [[Peter Dowrick]], a key researcher in the development of self-modeling, described two forms of VSM, ''feedforward'' and ''self-review''. ''Self-review'' involves someone with a relatively well developed skill watching examples of best performance.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"&gt;Dowrick, P. W. &amp; Biggs, J. (1983), Using Video: Psychological and social applications (1st ed.), New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the procedure used by [[Laura Wilkinson]], gold medal platform diver, prior to every meet. In an interview after her gold medal performance, she was asked how she prepares for competition.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;National Broadcasting Corporation (2000, September, 24). Laura Wilkinson gold medal interview - Sydney games. New York: NY.&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she watches a video that consists of her best dives along with encouragement from family and coaches. Self-review is mainly used in sports training as a form of [[visual imaging]].&lt;ref name="Buggey"&gt;Buggey, T. (2009). Seeing is Believing: Self-modeling Applications with Children with Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities. Baltimore; Woodbine House.&lt;/ref&gt; Feedforward, on the other hand, is used with people who do not have a skill or when a new skill is emerging. Thus, feedforward is the method most often used in instructional or clinical settings.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"/&gt; Because Feedforward involves new skills or behaviors performed by the viewer, it usually requires some degree of [[video editing]] to make it appear that the viewer is performing in an advanced manner. The term feedforward can be contrasted with the more traditional term ''[[feedback]]'' as it relates to receiving information about performance. Feedback allows people to see how they are doing. Feedforward allows them to see how they could be performing; a [[future self]]. Feedforward is mainly used in [[education]] and [[therapy]] circles and mainly with children with [[disabilities]]. It has been found to be especially effective with children with [[autism]] who tend to be [[Visual learning|visual learners]] and who seem to attend better to monitors than to live models.&lt;ref name="Bauman"&gt;Bauman, M. L.  (1999). Autism: Clinical features and neurological observations. In [[Helen Tager-Flusberg]] (Ed.) Neurological Disorders (pp. 383-399). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Research across an array of behaviors and many types of disabilities has been ongoing since 1970 with very positive results. Researchers report that changes occur rapidly, there is good maintenance, and that changes [[Generalization|generalize]] across settings.&lt;ref name="Bellini"&gt;Bellini, S. &amp; Akullian, J., (2007). A [[meta-analysis]] of [[video modeling]] and video self-modeling interventions for children and adolescents with [[autism spectrum disorders]]. Exceptional Children, 73, 261-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption by educators and therapists has lagged behind the research possibly because of the technology requirements for editing videos. The advent of user-friendly editing software such as [[iMovie]] and [[Movie Maker]] has gone a long way in solving that problem. Another reason that the use of VSM seems to be gathering momentum is an article that appeared in 2007 by Scott Bellini and Jennifer Akulian.&lt;ref name="Bellini"/&gt;  These researchers conducted a meta-analyses of all forms of video modeling and concluded that both peer and self-modeling met the Council for Exceptional Children's requirements for research-based methods.
Self-modeling has several attributes that sets it apart as a good tool to use with children with disabilities. It uses only positive imagery which makes it fit well into most [[positive behavior support]] plans. Effects of VSM should be seen almost immediately. If change is not seen after two or three viewings, one can move quickly to an alternate intervention.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"/&gt; Finally, there appears to be no real down-side to the method. No damage is done if it does not work for an individual. As Buggey states in his book, the only tangible outcome when no results are seen is that the person ends up with a flattering video of him or herself.&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt;
In his book, ''Seeing is Believing'', [[Tom Buggey]] lists three major ways video footage can be collected and compiled into a feedforward video:&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt;

# '''Imitation''' – Particularly useful with [[language]] skills. Children are prompted to say words or phrases. Words can be new or rarely used and phrases and sentences can be longer or more complex than presently used. Individual words can even be extracted from videos using [[video editing software]] and joined into sentences.
# '''[[Role playing]]''' – Particularly useful for social skills. Children act out scenes of proper behavior that are usually challenging for them. For example, the triggers of [[tantrums]] can be determined and then each trigger can become a scene in the VSM video – with the person performing appropriate alternative behaviors rather than tantruming.
# '''Let the camera roll to capture rare behaviors''' – typically used with persons who cannot imitate or follow directions. This can be very time-consuming; however, it has been used effectively for eating problems. A child can be filmed during several lunch periods and best examples of appropriate eating (such as putting food to mouth) can be extracted and combined into a feedforward movie.

== Caveats ==
Although VSM has shown overwhelming success with a range of ages and types of disabilities it has had problematic results with children under 4 yrs&lt;ref name="Buggey, T. (In Press)"&gt;Buggey, T. (2016). Facilitating social initiations with young preschoolers with autism using self-modeling: A replication. Focus on Autism and Other Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, E., Beck, D., Sloane, H., Goldsmith, D., Jenson, W., Bowen, J., Kehle, T. (1993). Self-Modeling with preschoolers. School Psychology International, 14, 83-89.&lt;/ref&gt; and with persons with very severe [[cognitive disabilities]] (although it has been successful with children with severe autism).&lt;ref name="Hoomes"&gt;Buggey, T., Hoomes, G., Williams, S. &amp; Sherberger, B. (2010). Facilitating social initiations with preschoolers with autism using self-modeling. Focus on Autism and Other Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt; Users must use caution to not depict behavior that is far beyond the viewer's ability. Showing skills beyond the reach of individuals can cause frustration and work counter to the purpose of VSM. Both [[Speech/language pathologist|speech/language]] and [[Physical therapy|physical]] or [[occupational therapist]]s need to be consulted when the skills needing to be addressed fall within their areas of expertise. (update: 2017. Studies with children under the age of 4 were restricted to the training of social skills. However, The Dept. of Education in Minnesota (MDOE) funded a training project for its Birth to 3 caregivers in 2013. Participants were trained in the use of VSM and were required to record and report results to a MDOE supervisor. Over 90 personnel were trained and 87 submitted results. All but 3 reported positive results. The skills addressed were mainly functional and language-based. Because none of these cases involved training social interaction skills, it was hypothesized that use of VSM with children under 4 [as young as 2 yrs. 1 mo.] was practical for certain behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, V. &amp; Buggey, T. (2014). The Minnesota Project: VSM use in Early Intervention. The Division of Early Childhood (CEC) Annual Conference. St. Louis, MO.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Users should also be aware of the differences between ''self-modeling'' and ''[[self-observation]]''. While self-modeling involves edited videos depicting only positive imagery, self-observation involves watching raw, unedited footage of behavior. The classic example of self-observation is watching game films in sports. Much can be gained by using self-observation; however, there is a risk that if behaviors viewed are too negative (e.g. a lineman missing blocking assignments 60% of the time) it could adversely affect [[self-confidence]], and thus the performance of the viewer. Buggey&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt; suggests that use of self-observation with children with disabilities should be used with extreme caution.

== Theory behind self-modeling ==

Many self-modeling researchers point to [[Albert Bandura]]'s studies&lt;ref name="Bandura"&gt;Bandura, A. (1994). Self-efficacy. In V. S. Ramachaudran (Ed.), Encyclopedia of human behavior (Vol. 4, pp. 71-81). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  on [[Observational learning|social learning]] as key to the understanding of the effectiveness of VSM. Bandura made two fundamental findings that relate directly to self modeling. The first is that the best models are those as close to the viewer as possible in all attributes including ability. You cannot get closer than when the model and viewer are the same person with only a slight change in ability. The other finding involves [[self-efficacy]], the belief that one can succeed at a task. Bandura found that the higher the belief in success, the higher the success rate. Self-modeling allows children to see themselves succeeding, and increases self-efficacy (as long as the new behavior is attainable and developmentally appropriate).

One of the reasons VSM may work so well with social behaviors may have been uncovered by Thomas Kehle and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Theodore"&gt;Kehle, T. J., Bray, M. A., Margiano, S. G., Theodore, L. A., &amp; Zhou, Z. (2002). Self-modeling as an effective intervention for students with serious emotional disturbance: Are we modifying children's memories? Psychology in the Schools, 39, 203-207.&lt;/ref&gt; While working with children with [[emotional disorder]]s who had had VSM intervention, they noticed that clients had difficulty remembering negative behaviors during [[exit interview]]s. They hypothesized that these individual were not only getting new memories based on VSM experiences, but they were also supplanting memories of the old behaviors. Their hypothesis was substantiated in the 2002 study. Their findings are preliminary and there have not been any published [[replication (scientific method)|replication]]s, but if substantiated, it raises both interesting methodological and ethical issues.

== Possible applications ==
Any behavior that can be observed, and thus filmed, can be a subject of a self-modeling video. In their meta-analyes article, Bellini and Akulian identified behaviors that were addressed in studies they evaluated. These include:
# [[Cognitive skill]]s such as math computation
# [[Selective mutism]]
# Language skills
# [[Activities of daily living|Functional skill]]s such as making beds or getting dressed
# [[Motor skill|Physical skill]]s such as swimming or lifting legs when walking
# [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
# [[Stuttering]]
# [[Oral reading fluency]]

The title '''Virgin''' (Latin ''Virgo'', Greek {{lang|grc|Παρθένος}}) is an honorific bestowed on female [[saint]]s and [[Beatification|blesseds]] in both the   [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

[[Chastity]] is one of the [[seven virtues]] in Christian tradition, listed by [[Pope Gregory I]] at the end of the 6th century. In  [[1 Corinthians]],  [[Saint Paul]] suggests a special role for virgins or unmarried women ({{lang|grc|ἡ γυνὴ καὶ ἡ παρθένος ἡ ἄγαμος}}) as more suitable for  "the things of the Lord" ({{lang|grc|μεριμνᾷ τὰ τοῦ κυρίου}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Corinthians]] 7:34 "There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband." ([[KJV]]). &lt;/ref&gt;
In [[2 Corinthians]] 11:2, Paul alludes to the metaphor of the Church as [[Bride of Christ]] by addressing the congregation 
"I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ".

In the theology of the [[Church Fathers]], the prototype of the sacred virgin is [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], consecrated by the [[Holy Spirit]] at [[Annunciation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/speeches/2008/may/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080515_ordo-virginum.html Pope Benedict XVI. "Address to the Participants in the International Congress of the ''Ordo Virginum''", May 15, 2008, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;  
Although not stated in the gospels, the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] was widely upheld as a dogma by the Church Fathers from  the 4th century. 

==Virgin martyrs==
[[File:Mantegna, santa eufemia, capodimonte.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Euphemia]] with [[Crown of martyrdom|crown]], [[lily]] and [[palm branch]] ([[Andrea Mantegna ]], 1454)]]

In the [[hagiography]] of [[Christian martyrs]] of the late 1st to early 4th centuries, '''virgin martyrs''' 
(Latin ''{{lang|la|virgo et martyr}}'', Greek {{lang|grc|παρθένος-μάρτυρας}}, Russian {{lang|ru|дева-мученица}})
are Christian virgins, often persecuted for their refusal to enter a worldly marriage after having vowed to keep their virginity.

==Other virgin saints==

The first known formal consecration is that of [[Saint Marcellina]], dated AD 353, mentioned in ''De Virginibus'' by her brother, [[Saint Ambrose]]. Another early consecrated virgin is [[Saint Genevieve]] (c. 422 &amp;ndash; c. 512).

[[Margaret of Hungary (saint)|Saint Margaret of Hungary]] (1242–1270) is noted as a nun and virgin, as she received 
a separate consecration as a virgin in spite of already having taken monastic vows; this was done in order to dissuade her father, king [[Béla IV of Hungary]], from trying to have her vows rescinded by the pope for the purposes of a political marriage.

According to [[Raymond of Capua]], [[Catherine of Siena]] (c. 1347–1380) at the age of twenty-one (c. 1368) experienced what she described in her letters as a "[[Bridal theology|Mystical Marriage]]" with [[Jesus]], later a popular subject in art as the ''[[Mystic marriage of Saint Catherine]]''.

Saint [[Thérèse of Lisieux]] (1873–1897), canonized in 1925.

==Consecrated virgins==
{{main|Consecrated virgin}}
The tradition of the rite of consecration dates back to the 4th century. The rite for virgins living in the world has been reintroduced under [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1970. &lt;ref name=OCV&gt;''Ordo Consecrationis Virginum'' (31 May 1970),
''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis|AAS]]'' 62 (1970) 650 = ''EDIL'' 2082-2092 = ''DOL'' 294 no. 3352. English translation: ''The Rites of the Catholic Church'' 2 (n. 29, p. 81), 132-164, ''DOL'' 395 nos. 3253-3262.&lt;/ref&gt; The reintroduction of the rite of consecration of virgins for women living in the world was notably campaigned for by [[Anne Leflaive]] (1899–1987), who had been consecrated as a virgin in 1924, and who campaigned for the formal recognition of the rite of consecration during the 1920s to 1960s.&lt;ref name=Roux&gt;Jacqueline Roux, [https://consecratedvirgins.org/usacv/sites/default/files/documents/VocRes/laflaive.pdf Summary of Anne Laflaive: One Life for the Reawakening of a Forgotten Vocation]{{year needed|date=July 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of consecrated virgins ranges in the thousands. While the Holy See does not keep official statistics, estimates derived from diocesane records range at around 5,000 consecrated virgins worldwide as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadette Mary Reis, [https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2018-07/order-virgins-ecclesiae-sponsae-imago.html "Church reproposes Order of Virgins 50 years after its restoration"], Vatican News, 4 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, according to the Ministry of Environment 75% of water and 50% of sanitation services in France are provided by the private sector, primarily by two firms, [[Veolia Water]] and [[Suez Environnement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/Les-differents-modes-de-gestion-de.html Ministry of Environment: Water management models] quotes even higher figures: 75% for water and 50% for sanitation {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143443/http://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/Les-differents-modes-de-gestion-de.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the ''Loi Sapin'' strengthened competition in the sector by limiting the duration of contracts to 20 years, among others. In 2010 the lease contracts for Paris with [[Suez Environnement]] and [[Veolia Water]] expired and the water system returned to public management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remunicipalisation.org/cases#Paris Remunicipalization Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Municipality of Paris:[http://www.paris.fr/portail/accueil/Portal.lut?page_id=1&amp;document_type_id=2&amp;document_id=76394&amp;portlet_id=21961 L'eau remunicipalisée depuis le 1er janvier], 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of privatization==

The typical form of delegated management (Gestion Déléguée) from the public to the private sector is through a [[lease]] contract (''Affermage'') or a [[concession (contract)|concession]] contract. A lease contract is of shorter duration (10–15 years) and the responsibility to finance most of the infrastructure remains with the municipality. A concession contract is of longer duration (20–30 years) and the Concessionnaire is in charge of mobilizing financial resources. In both cases, the municipality or the Intermunicipal utility fixes the water and sanitation tariff and remains the owner of the infrastructure. Other forms of delegated management include the ''Régie intéressée'' and the ''Gérance'', less common forms of private sector participation under which the private sector takes fewer risks.

==Water companies==

There are three large private French water companies:
* [[Veolia Environnement]] (known as ''Compagnie Générale des Eaux'' in France) provided drinking water to 24.6 million people and wastewater services to 16.7 million people in 2010, in partnership with more than 8,000 municipalities, including [[Lyon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veoliawater.com/about/locations/france.htm Veolia in France], retrieved on June 5, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[SUEZ]] (known as ''Compagnie Lyonnaise des Eaux'' in France) provided 12 million people with water services in 5,000 municipalities and 9 million with wastewater services in 2,600 municipalities &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyonnaise-des-eaux.fr/qui-sommes-nous/strategie-et-valeurs/chiffres-cles Chiffres clés], retrieved on June 5, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[:fr:Groupe SAUR|SAUR]] provides water and sanitation services to 5.5 million people in more than 6,700 municipalities and municipal associations, mainly in rural and peri-urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saur.com/en/index.html SAUR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The private Société des Eaux de Marseille (SEM), half owned by Veolia Environnement and half owned by SUEZ, provides [[Marseille]] with water and wastewater services. 

== Assessment of private sector participation ==
Private sector participation in water supply and sanitation has a long tradition in France and has provided many benefits to municipalities, such as lower levels of public debt. However, it is not without its critics. A comparative assessment of public and private service provision is complicated by the absence of a mandatory national performance benchmarking system. Therefore, supporters and opponents of private sector participation often find it hard to provide objective figures to back up their respective positions.

===Comparison of tariff levels===
According to the Ministry of Environment, in 1992 tariffs by private providers were 22% higher than for public providers.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Environment"&gt;[http://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/Les-differents-modes-de-gestion-de.html Ministry of Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143443/http://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/Les-differents-modes-de-gestion-de.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After competition in the sector has been strengthened through the ''Loi Sapin'' in 1993, the difference declined to 13% in 1998, according to the Ministry of Environment.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Environment" /&gt; No matter how high the difference is, these assessments do not compare apples with apples. For example, public companies do not have to pay for the acquisition of public land. Also, they are not subject to corporate income tax (''taxe professionnelle'') or property tax (''redevance pour occupation du domaine public'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-info/i3081.asp#P328_35250 Rapport d'information n° 3081], Assemblée nationale, 22 mai 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Both factors reduce the costs of public companies compared to private companies without providing an economic benefit, since the higher costs of private companies are channeled back to the public treasury. In addition, a study by the research institute INRA showed that the municipalities with the most difficult conditions tend to delegate service provision to the private sector, thus biasing the comparison of tariff levels. Among the conditions driving municipalities to seek private sector participation are the classification in an ecologically sensitive zone implying stricter wastewater treatment standards and a lower population density implying a longer network per customer.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Carpentier, Céline Naugues, Arnaud Reynaud and Alban Thomas: "''[http://www.inra.fr/internet/Departements/ESR/publications/iss/pdf_eng/iss04-2_Eng.pdf Une mesure de l'effet de la délégation sur le prix de l'eau en France]", Institut national de la recherche agronomique (INRA) - Sciences Sociales,'' Volume 19, juillet 2004, no. 2. The study uses data from the 1999 survey "''Prix de l'eau dans les collectivités territoriales''" of the ''Institut Français de l'Environnement'', among others.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Competition===
A 2003 report by the French Supreme Audit Agency (''Cour des Comptes'') on water and sanitation in France covering the period 1995-2002 confirms that in 1999, six years after the Loi Sapin strengthened competition, 85% of contracts were still renewed with the incumbent. The ''Cour des Comptes'' noted that many municipalities, including some large ones, do not have the capacity to control the private sector contracts, in particular unjustified increases of certain fees. The municipalities do not use the numerous legal instruments at their disposal to better control the lease contracts they sign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/CC/documents/RPT/RapportEau.pdf Cour des Comptes, La gestion des services publics d’eau et d’assainissement, 2003], p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics, the three large private water companies are in a stronger negotiation position than the municipalities, thus leading to a lack of meaningful competition and [[regulatory capture]].&lt;ref name="globenet1"&gt;[http://www.globenet.org/aitec/chantiers/sp/eau/SPeauFrance.html Association Internationale de Techniciens, Experts et Chercheurs (AITEC):DOSSIER EAU - Le service public de l'eau en France]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency===
The annual financial reports submitted by the private enterprises to the municipalities are often not very transparent. For example, the ''Cour des Comptes'' noted that these reports cannot be compared to the financial projections submitted during contract negotiation, because they are established on different bases.

In some cases, private water companies also use accounting tricks to increase their profit margin. The ''Cour des Comptes'' noted that revenues from ancillary activities, such as the sale of bulk water to neighboring municipalities or electricity sales from hydropower production, are sometimes omitted from the financial reports to the municipalities. Furthermore, some operators cover fees for a “renewal guarantee” without fully reinvesting the proceeds. These revenues thus constitute a net gain for the operator at the end of the contract. Also, water companies are allowed to carry out works through their own subsidiaries without selecting them according to the local government regulations for competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/CC/documents/RPT/RapportEau.pdf Cour des Comptes, La gestion des services publics d’eau et d’assainissement, 2003], p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, large utilities can manipulate transfer prices, thus making their finances even more intransparent to municipal regulators.

===Campaign financing and corruption===
Private water utilities have been used as a vehicle for financing election campaigns and other political activities, leading to corrupt practices despite several laws passed to prevent corruption in the 1990s, such as the ''Loi Sapin''. Some municipal associations, such as in [[Grenoble]], have sued private operators leading to the cancellation of contracts and to a prison sentence against the mayor of Grenoble in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globenet.org/aitec/chantiers/sp/eau/SPeauFrance.html Association Internationale de Techniciens, Experts et Chercheurs (AITEC):DOSSIER EAU - Le service public de l'eau en France] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.psiru.org/reports/Grenoble.doc PSIRU Grenoble]&lt;/ref&gt;
