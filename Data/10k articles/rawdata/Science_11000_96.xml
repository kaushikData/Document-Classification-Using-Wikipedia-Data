The '''A1077 road''' runs through [[North Lincolnshire]], [[England]], between [[Scunthorpe]] and South Killingholme.

==Route==
===Scunthorpe to Barton===
The western terminus of the A1077 starts at the [[M181 motorway]] ''[[Frodingham, Lincolnshire|Frodingham]] Grange'' roundabout in Gunness, next to the ground of [[Scunthorpe United F.C.]], a large [[Tesco]], a [[Frankie &amp; Benny's]], the Gallagher Retail Park, and [[Travelodge UK|Travelodge]] Scunthorpe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/281/Scunthorpe-hotel Travelodge Scunthorpe] Retrieved 13 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is Scunthorpe's northern ring road, built as the North West Orbital in stages 1, 2A, 2B and 3, funded by the [[European Regional Development Fund|ERDF]], and known now as the ''Phoenix Parkway''. There is left turn at the ''Neap House Junction'' for the B1216 for Gunness, in [[Flixborough]], then the ''Skippingdale Roundabout'' for the Skippingdale Industrial Estate to the north and [[OSI Group|OSI Food Solutions]] to the south; this factory makes all the burgers for [[McDonald's]] in the UK - 3 million a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osigroup.com/locations/ OSI Group] Retrieved 13 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There is the ''Foxhills Roundabout'' for the large Foxhills Industrial Estate, home of the national [[Nisa (retailer)]], then a roundabout for the B1430 for [[Normanby Hall]] and the [[Normanby, North Lincolnshire|Normanby]] Distribution Park, then a smaller roundabout for the [[Sawcliffe]] Industrial Estate to the south, and a roundabout with the A1029 (for Scunthorpe) at the [[Dragonby]] Vale Enterprise Park. 

It passes through [[Roxby cum Risby]], and [[Roxby, Lincolnshire]] itself. At [[Winterton, Lincolnshire|Winterton]], the north-south route has a staggered junction with the B1430. The eastwards route is the parish boundary between Winterton and [[Winteringham]], with a right turn for the B1207 for Winterton. The landscape is flat, alongside the southern bank of the [[Humber]]. It meets the A15 at the grade-separated ''Barton on Humber Junction'', built in 1978.

===Barton to South Killingholme===
The road passes west-east through the middle of [[Barton-upon-Humber]]. The road passes a former [[Kimberly-Clark]] factory, to the north, which made [[Huggies]]. It passes through [[Thornton Curtis]] and the ''Thornton Hunt'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thorntonhuntinn.co.uk/home/ Thornton Hunt Inn] Retrieved 13 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Wootton, North Lincolnshire]] and the ''Nags Head''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nagsheadwootton.co.uk/ Nags Head] Retrieved 13 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This section of the road is part of a larger north-west to south-east route that is known as ''Barton Street'' and leads onto the A18. At Ulceby Grange there is a T-junction, and a right turn for the B1211, for [[Croxton, Lincolnshire|Croxton]] and [[Brigg]]. The road passes west-east through [[Ulceby, North Lincolnshire]]. ''Barton Street'' is the B1211 to the south, at a right turn, leading to the A18. At [[Ulceby railway station]] there is a [[Level crossings in the United Kingdom|level crossing]] with the [[Barton line]], and the road enters South Killingholme, and passes the ''Yarborough Arms''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yarborougharms.co.uk/ Yarborough Arms] Retrieved 13 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A few hundred metres after the road is crossed by two 400kV pylon lines, the road has its eastern terminus at the A160 T-junction.

==Former route==
The western terminus was originally in Scunthorpe at a roundabout of the A1076 and A1029.

'''''A Short History of Nearly Everything''''' by American author [[Bill Bryson]] is a [[popular science]] book that explains some areas of science, using easily accessible language that appeals more so to the general public than many other books dedicated to the subject. It was one of the bestselling popular science books of 2005 in the United Kingdom, selling over 300,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff of BBC Focus|first=|date=July 2006|title=How to... Make a Mint From Science|url=|journal=|publisher=[[BBC Focus]]|volume=|pages=54|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Short History'' deviates from Bryson's popular [[Travel literature|travel book]] genre, instead describing general sciences such as [[chemistry]], [[paleontology]], [[astronomy]], and [[particle physics]]. In it, he explores time from the [[Big Bang]] to the discovery of [[quantum mechanics]], via [[evolution]] and [[geology]].

== Background ==
Bill Bryson wrote this book because he was dissatisfied with his ''scientific knowledge''—that was, not much at all. He writes that science was a distant, unexplained subject at school. Textbooks and teachers alike did not ignite the passion for knowledge in him, mainly because they never delved in the ''whys'', ''hows'', and ''whens''.

{{quote|"It was as if [the textbook writer] wanted to keep the good stuff secret by making all of it soberly unfathomable."|Bryson, on the state of science books used within his school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Bryson |first=Bill |publication-date=May 2003 |title=A Short History of Nearly Everything |publisher=[[Broadway Books]] |location=USA |isbn=0-7679-0817-1
|authorlink=Bill Bryson}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Contents ==
Bryson describes graphically and in layperson's terms [[Universe#Size, age, contents, structure, and laws|the size of the universe]] and that of [[atom]]s and [[subatomic particles]]. He then explores the history of [[geology]] and [[biology]] and traces life from its first appearance to today's modern humans, placing emphasis on the development of the modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Furthermore, he discusses the possibility of the Earth being struck by a [[meteorite]] and reflects on human capabilities of spotting a meteor before it [[Impact event|impacts the Earth]], and the extensive damage that such an event would cause. He also describes some of the most recent destructive disasters of volcanic origin in the history of our planet, including [[Krakatoa]] and [[Yellowstone National Park]].

A large part of the book is devoted to relating humorous stories about the scientists behind the research and discoveries and their sometimes eccentric behaviours. Bryson also speaks about modern scientific views on human effects on the Earth's climate and livelihood of other species, and the magnitude of natural disasters such as [[earthquakes]], [[volcanoes]], [[tsunamis]], [[hurricanes]], and the [[mass extinctions]] caused by some of these events.

The book contains several factual errors and inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://errata.wikidot.com/0767908171 Errata and corrigenda: "A Short History of Nearly Everything" by Bill Bryson]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have arisen because new discoveries have been made since the book's publication, and some classifications have changed. For example, [[Pluto]] has been reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]], and the universe is not going to stop [[Metric_expansion_of_space|expanding, it is speeding up]].

An illustrated edition of the book was released in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of Nearly Everything: Special Illustrated Edition|last=Bryson|first=Bill|publisher=Broadway Books|isbn=0-7679-2322-7|location=|publication-date=November 2005|pages=|authorlink=Bill Bryson}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few editions in [[Audiobook]] form are also available, including an abridged version read by the author, and at least three unabridged versions.

== Awards and reviews ==
The book received generally favourable reviews, with reviewers citing the book as informative, well-written, and highly entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/21/billbryson.scienceandnature|title=Everything you've ever wanted to know (but didn't dare ask)|last=Waller|first=John|date=June 21, 2003|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=June 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060724/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/21/billbryson.scienceandnature|archive-date=March 12, 2017|dead-url=No|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jupiterscientific.org/review/shne.html|title=A Book Review of: ''A Short History of Nearly Everything'' by Bill Bryson – Broadway Books, 2003|last=Jupiter Scientific staff|first=|date=2004|website=Jupiter Scientific|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221140708/http://www.jupiterscientific.org/review/shne.html|archive-date=December 21, 2017|dead-url=No|access-date=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/a-short-history-of-nearly-everything|title=Review – A Short History of Nearly Everything|last=Ayers|first=Kate|date=January 23, 2011|website=Bookreporter|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808130013/https://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/a-short-history-of-nearly-everything|archive-date=August 8, 2017|dead-url=No|access-date=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, this book won Bryson the prestigious [[The Aventis Prizes for Science Books|Aventis Prize]] for best general science book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3806375.stm|title=Bryson wins £10,000 science prize|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=June 14, 2004|work=|accessdate=March 15, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125022342/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3806375.stm|archive-date=January 25, 2018|dead-url=No|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryson later donated the [[Pound sterling|GBP£]]10,000 prize to the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] children's charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/22/awardsandprizes.scienceandnature|title=Bryson gives away Aventis winnings|last=Crown|first=Sarah|date=June 22, 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=June 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630081915/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/22/awardsandprizes.scienceandnature|archive-date=June 30, 2018|dead-url=No|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the book won the EU [[Descartes Prize]] for science communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/07/scienceprizes.billbryson|title=Bryson wins Descartes prize for his guide to science|last=Pauli|first=Michelle|date=December 7, 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=June 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630082035/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/07/scienceprizes.billbryson|archive-date=June 30, 2018|dead-url=No|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was shortlisted for the [[Samuel Johnson Prize]] for the same year.

A '''bioinformatics workflow management system''' is a specialized form of [[workflow management system]] designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a [[workflows|workflow]], that relate to [[bioinformatics]].

There are currently many different workflow systems. Some have been developed more generally as [[scientific workflow system]]s for use by scientists from many different disciplines like [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. All such systems are based on an abstract representation of how a computation proceeds in the form of a directed graph, where each node represents a task to be executed and edges represent either data flow or execution dependencies between different tasks.  Each system typically provides a visual front-end, allowing the user to build and modify complex applications with little or no programming expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Oinn | first1 = T. | last2 = Greenwood | first2 = M. | last3 = Addis | first3 = M. | last4 = Alpdemir | first4 = M.

==Comparisons between workflow systems==
With a large number of bioinformatics workflow systems to choose from, it becomes difficult to understand and compare the features of the different workflow systems. There has been little work conducted in evaluating and comparing the systems from a bioinformatician's perspective, especially when it comes to comparing the data types they can deal with, the in-built functionalities that are provided to the user or even their performance or usability. Examples of existing comparisons include

* The paper "Scientific workflow systems-can one size fit all?",&lt;ref name="CIBEC 2008"/&gt; which provides a high-level framework for comparing workflow systems based on their control flow and data flow properties. The systems compared include [[Discovery Net]], [[Taverna workbench|Taverna]], Triana, [[Kepler scientific workflow system|Kepler]] as well as Yawl and [[Business Process Execution Language|BPEL]].
* The paper "Meta-workflows: pattern-based interoperability between Galaxy and Taverna"&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book | last1 = Abouelhoda | first1 = M. | last2 = Alaa | first2 = S. | last3 = Ghanem | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1145/1833398.1833400 | chapter = Meta-workflows | title = Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Workflow Approaches to New Data-centric Science - Wands '10 | pages = 1 | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781450301886 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a more user-oriented comparison between [[Taverna workbench|Taverna]] and [[Galaxy (computational biology)|Galaxy]] in the context of enabling interoperability between both systems.

* The infrastructure paper "Delivering ICT Infrastructure for Biomedical Research"&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3318">Professor '''Byron Barnard Lamont''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (born 2 January 1945) is a [[Western Australia]]n botanist. He is currently a senior researcher within the Department of Environmental Biology of [[Curtin University of Technology]]. A specialist in [[ecology]] of the flora of the [[South West Botanic Province]], he has published hundreds of papers.

Born in [[Perth, Western Australia]], he attended Applecross and Mount Pleasant Primary Schools, and later [[Wesley College, Perth|Wesley College]]. From 1963 to 1966 he pursued undergraduate studies at the Instituate of Agriculture, [[University of Western Australia]], graduating with a Bachelor of Agricultural Science with majors in Soils, Agronomy and Microbiology. He then undertook a Master's degree under the supervision of [[Brian Grieve]], focussed on soil-plant relationships of ''[[Hakea]]'', especially its [[proteoid root]]s. His research into proteoid roots earned him a [[PhD.]] in 1974. Thereafter he began studying part time for a [[Doctor of Science]] degree, which was  awarded in 1993. During this period he held a series of academic positions within Curtin University of Technology.

Among his many publications are two books, around 30 book chapters and review papers, and over 100 journal papers. He is the author of ''[[Hakea cygna]]'', [[Hakea cygna subsp. needlei|''H.&amp;nbsp;c.''&amp;nbsp;subsp. ''needlei'']] and ''[[Hakea erecta|H.&amp;nbsp;erecta]]''. He also published the name ''Hakea rubriflora'', but this has since been found to be a synonym of ''[[Hakea denticulata|H.&amp;nbsp;denticulata]]''.

Lamont was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the [[2010 Australia Day Honours]] "For service to conservation and the environment, particularly Australian flora as an educator, researcher and author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LAMONT, Byron Barnard|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1141788|website=Australian Honours Search Facility, Dept of Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He currently lives in the Perth suburb of [[Bull Creek, Western Australia|Bull Creek]]. He is married with two adult children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">In the study of [[shortest path problem|path-finding problems]] in [[artificial intelligence]], a [[heuristic function]] is said to be '''consistent''', or '''monotone''', if its estimate is always less than or equal to the estimated distance from any neighboring vertex to the goal, plus the cost of reaching that neighbor.

Formally, for every node ''N'' and each [[Successor_(graph_theory)#Direction|successor]] ''P'' of ''N'', the estimated cost of reaching the goal from ''N'' is no greater than the step cost of getting to ''P'' plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from ''P''. That is:
: &lt;math&gt;h(N) \leq c(N,P) + h(P)&lt;/math&gt; and 
: &lt;math&gt;h(G) = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:* ''h'' is the consistent heuristic function
:* ''N'' is any node in the graph
:* ''P'' is any descendant of ''N''
:* ''G'' is any goal node
:* c(N,P) is the cost of reaching node P from N

A consistent heuristic is also [[admissible heuristic|admissible]], i.e. it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal (the [[Converse (logic)|converse]], however, is not always true). This is proved by induction on &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, the length of the best path from node to goal. By assumption, &lt;math&gt;h(N_m) \leq h^*(N_m)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h^*(n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the cost of the shortest path from ''n'' to the goal. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;h(N_{m+1}) \leq c(N_{m+1}, N_m) + h(N_m) \leq c(N_{m+1}, N_m) + h^*(N_m) = h^*(N_{m+1})&lt;/math&gt;,
making it admissible. (&lt;math&gt;N_{m+1}&lt;/math&gt; is any node whose best path to the goal, of length m+1, goes through some immediate child &lt;math&gt;N_{m}&lt;/math&gt; whose best path to the goal is of length m.)

However, an admissible heuristic &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, can be made into a consistent heuristic, &lt;math&gt;h'&lt;/math&gt;, through the following adjustment:
: &lt;math&gt; h'(P) \gets \max(h(P), h(N) - c(N,P)) &lt;/math&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; equation.)

==Consequences of monotonicity==
[[File:Heuristics Comparison.png|thumb|250px|Comparison of an admissible but inconsistent and a consistent heuristic evaluation function.]]
Consistent heuristics are called monotone because the estimated final cost of a partial solution, &lt;math&gt;f(N_j)=g(N_j)+h(N_j)&lt;/math&gt; is monotonically non-decreasing along the best path to the goal, where &lt;math&gt;g(N_j)=\sum_{i=2}^j c(N_{i-1},N_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost of the best path from start node &lt;math&gt;N_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N_j&lt;/math&gt;.  It's necessary and sufficient for a heuristic to obey the [[triangle inequality]] in order to be consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | first = Judea
 | last = Pearl
 | title = Heuristics: Intelligent Search Strategies for Computer Problem Solving
 | publisher = Addison-Wesley
 | year = 1984
 | isbn = 0-201-05594-5
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[A* search algorithm]], using a consistent heuristic means that once a node is expanded, the cost by which it was reached is the lowest possible, under the same conditions that Dijkstra's algorithm requires in solving the [[shortest path problem]] (no negative cost cycles).  In fact, if the search graph is given cost &lt;math&gt;c'(N,P)=c(N,P)+h(P)-h(N)&lt;/math&gt; for a consistent &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, then A* is equivalent to best-first search on that graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.&lt;ref name="Russell 1995"/&gt;  In the unusual event that an admissible heuristic is not consistent, a node will need repeated expansion every time a new best (so-far) cost is achieved for it.

The '''Craig telescope''' was a large telescope built in the 1850s, and while much larger than previous refracting telescopes, it had some problems that hampered its use.&lt;ref name="Information"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trZX7dbuW54C&amp;pg=PA573&amp;lpg=PA573&amp;dq=craig+telescope&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ozK9Ftqqjm&amp;sig=4GVs3PTxOdjy0pEin_oJHrVMgE0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0wJKBw73RAhURfiYKHRTJC5cQ6AEIUzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=craig%20telescope&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist|last=Information|first=Reed Business|date=1982-12-02|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its unique design and potential caused a great deal of excitement about it in its day.&lt;ref name="Information"/&gt; The telescope was ready in August 1852 and was visited by the [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|William Parsons]] (he was famous for the [[Leviathan of Parsonstown]], the largest telescope overall of this age).&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=trZX7dbuW54C&amp;pg=PA573&amp;lpg=PA573&amp;dq=craig+telescope&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ozK9Ftqqjm&amp;sig=4GVs3PTxOdjy0pEin_oJHrVMgE0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0wJKBw73RAhURfiYKHRTJC5cQ6AEIUzAL#v=onepage&amp;q=craig%20telescope&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is known to been used to observe the planet [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

It was the largest refracting telescope (a telescope with a lens) in the world from 1852 to 1857, erected near London, England.&lt;ref name=craig1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ns82&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=trZX7dbuW54C&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=%22Craig+telescope%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZfF-TJjxM8T38Abpy4DYAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Craig%20telescope%22&amp;f=false New Scientist: Dec 2, 1982 "The Monster Telescope at Wandworth"]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[great refractor]], a large refracting telescope with an [[achromatic lens|achromatic]]  [[Doublet (lens)|doublet]] with an aperture of 61&amp;nbsp;cm (2 feet (24 inches)) and that was completed in 1852 in [[Wandsworth Common]] and dismantled around 1857 (although the brick tower probably survived until 1870).&lt;ref name=craig1&gt;[http://www.craig-telescope.co.uk/ The Online Museum of the Craig Telescope (www.craig-telescope.co.uk)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ns82/&gt; It had a focal length of 76–83 feet.&lt;ref name=scidisc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MiUFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Craig+telescope&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lv5-TO31MML88AajoenRAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Craig%20telescope&amp;f=false ANNUAL OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY:1854, Page 156 (Google Books 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; Its namesake, the Rev. John Craig, spent a small fortune to produce a uniquely designed telescope with nearly double the aperture of the next largest refracting telescopes, making it the largest refracting telescope in the World for the better part of a decade.&lt;ref name=craig1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ns82/&gt;  However, it had problem with its lens figuring starting from its [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] in the summer of 1852.&lt;ref name=craig1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B5kAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22Craig+telescope%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lvp-TIGwE4G88gbyou3UAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Craig%20telescope%22&amp;f=false The Mechanics' magazine, museum, register, journal, and gazette, Volume 57, Page 354. (Google Books 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; It soon fell into disuse as that same year Craig lost his only son, then his wife in 1854, and lost his brother and was put in jail for 6 weeks in 1856.&lt;ref name=craig1/&gt;

Craig did not have the lens re-figured and the telescope struggled to achieve his modest goals, which included observations of Earth's Moon and Saturn.&lt;ref name=craig1/&gt; It was eventually demolished and Craig moved on to other projects, including opening one of the first indoor skating rinks.&lt;ref name=craig1/&gt;

The doublet was made with [[flint glass]] by [[Chance Brothers]] and a plate glass by [[Thames Plate Glass Company]].&lt;ref name=ns82/&gt; The mounting was designed by [[William Gravatt]], and featured a 19.5 meter tall brick tower with a 24.5 m long cigar shaped telescope tube (built by [[Messrs Rennie]]) slung from the side.&lt;ref name=ns82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O00AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=%22Craig+telescope%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZfF-TJjxM8T38Abpy4DYAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Craig%20telescope%22&amp;f=false "The geography of the heavens: and class-book of astronomy: accompanied by a ..."

The next largest refractors were two 15 inch (38&amp;nbsp;cm) refractors built by Merz and Mahler of Münich ([[Joseph Fraunhofer]]'s firm), one at [[Pulkovo Observatory]] in Europe and one at [[Harvard College Observatory]] in America. The largest telescope at the time was in Ireland, a 6-foot (183&amp;nbsp;cm) aperture [[speculum metal|metal]] mirror by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]]. (see "[[Leviathan of Parsonstown]]")

One of the goals for the telescope was to look for a Moon for Venus and to confirm the third (Crepe) ring of saturn&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; Some of the reported issues were with the overall lens quality and troubles in the personal life of Craig.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

'''''Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo and the Making of the Animal Kingdom''''' is a 2005 book by the [[molecular biologist]] [[Sean B. Carroll]]. It presents a summary of the emerging field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] and the role of [[evo-devo gene toolkit|toolkit genes]]. It has won numerous awards for science communication.

The book's somewhat controversial&lt;ref name=Coyne/&gt; argument is that [[evolution]] in animals (though no doubt similar processes occur in other organisms) proceeds mostly by modifying the way that regulatory genes, which do not code for structural [[protein]]s (such as [[enzyme]]s), control [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. In turn, these regulatory genes turn out to be based on a very old set of [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] genes which Carroll nicknames the toolkit. Almost identical sequences can be found across the animal kingdom, meaning that toolkit genes such as ''[[Hox gene|Hox]]'' must have evolved before the [[Cambrian radiation]] which created most of the animal [[body plan]]s that exist today. These genes are used and reused, occasionally by duplication but far more often by being applied unchanged to new functions. Thus the same [[cell signalling|signal]] may be given at a different time in development, in a different part of the embryo, creating a different effect on the adult body. In Carroll's view, this explains how so many body forms are created with so few structural genes.

The book has been praised by critics, and called the most important popular science book since [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''.

===Context===
{{further|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

The title quotes from the last sentence of [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', in which he described the [[evolution]] of all living organisms from [[Last universal ancestor|a common ancestor]]: "endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."&lt;ref name="On The Origin of Species"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Darwin | first1=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin | title=On The Origin of Species | chapter=XIV | year=1859 | page=503 | url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species_(1859)/Chapter_XIV | accessdate=27 February 2011 | isbn=0-8014-1319-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin, however, was unable to explain how those body forms actually came into being. The early 20th century [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of evolution and genetics, too, largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved. That task was finally undertaken at the end of the 20th century with the arrival of [[recombinant DNA]] technology, when biologists were able to start to explore how development was actually controlled.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1991&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilbert, S. F.; Opitz, J. M.; Raff, R. A. |title=Resynthesizing evolutionary and developmental biology |journal=Developmental Biology |date=1996 |volume=173 |pages=357–372 |doi=10.1006/dbio.1996.0032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cambrian Trilobite Olenoides Mt. Stephen.jpg|thumb|upright|The body of a [[trilobite]]  is made of many similar modules (body segments with pairs of appendages). These could be made by repeated use of the same [[toolkit gene]]s.]]

; Part I The Making of Animals
: 1. Animal Architecture: Modern Forms, Ancient Designs
::: Carroll argues that many animals have a modular design with repeated parts, as in [[trilobite]]s with repeated segments, or the repeated fingers of a [[human hand]].
: 2. Monsters, Mutants, and Master Genes
::: [[Embryologist]]s study how bodies develop, and the abnormalities when things go wrong, such as [[homeotic]] variants when one body part is changed into another (for instance, a fruit fly antenna becomes a leg with the ''[[Antennapedia]]'' mutant).
: 3. From ''[[E. coli]]'' to Elephants
::: This chapter tells the tale of the [[genetic code]], and the [[lac operon]], showing that the environment and genetic switches together [[regulation of gene expression|control gene expression]]. He introduces the [[evo-devo gene toolkit]].
: 4. Making Babies&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; 25,000 Genes, Some Assembly Required 
::: Carroll looks at how a [[Drosophila embryogenesis|fruit fly's embryonic development]] is controlled and describes his own discoveries (back in 1994).
: 5. The Dark Matter of the Genome: Operating Instructions for the Tool Kit 
::: The chapter describes how genes are switched on and off in a precisely choreographed time sequence and 3-dimensional pattern in the developing embryo and how the logic can be modified by [[evolution]] to create different animal bodies.

[[File:FMIB 35665 Common Crayfish (Astacus fluviatilis, Male) (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Crayfish]] limbs are highly specialised, adapted by [[evo-devo gene toolkit]] changes from the simple appendages of their trilobite-like ancestors.]]
[[File:Drosophila gap gene in situ.png|thumb|upright|This fruit fly embryo is stained to show the [[gene expression|expression]] of [[gap gene|some of the genes]] (named) that control [[Drosophila embryogenesis|its development]].]]

; Part II Fossils, Genes, and the Making of Animal Diversity
: 6. The Big Bang of Animal Evolution
::: The [[Cambrian radiation]] saw an explosion in the variety of animal [[body plan]]s, from [[flatworms]] and [[molluscs]] to [[arthropods]] and [[vertebrates]]. Carroll explains how shifting the pattern of ''[[Hox gene|Hox]]'' gene expression shaped the bodies of different types of arthropods and different types of vertebrates.
: 7. Little Bangs&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Wings and Other Revolutionary Inventions 
::: This chapter explains how evolution goes to work within a lineage, [[Williston's law|specialising arthropod limbs]] from all being alike to "all of the different implements a humble [[crayfish]] carries", with (he writes) more gizmos than a [[Swiss Army knife]].
: 8. How the Butterfly Got Its Spots 
::: Echoing the titles of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]'', Carroll shows how butterfly wing patterns evolved, including his discovery of the role of the ''[[Distal-less]]'' gene there, until then known in limb development. Evidently, a genetic switch could be reused for different purposes.
: 9. Paint It Black 
::: Carroll looks at [[zebra]] stripes, [[industrial melanism]] in the [[peppered moth]] and the spots of [[big cat]]s, all examples of the control of pattern in animals, down to molecular level.
: 10. A Beautiful Mind: The Making of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. 
::: This chapter discusses how humans differ from other apes and why there are not many structural genes for the differences. Most of the changes are in genetic control, not in proteins.
: 11. Endless Forms Most Beautiful 
::: Carroll concludes by revisiting Darwin's ''Origin of Species'', starting with how Darwin evolved the final paragraph of his book, leaving only these four words "completely untouched throughout all versions and editions". He shows that evo-devo is a cornerstone of a synthesis of evolution, genetics, and embryology, replacing the "[[Modern synthesis (20th century)|Modern synthesis]]" of 20th century biology.

The book is illustrated with photographs, such as of [[Drosophila embryogenesis|developing fruit fly embryos]] dyed to show the effects of [[toolkit gene]]s, and with line drawings by Jamie W. Carroll, Josh P. Klaiss and Leanne M. Olds.

==Reception==
[[File:Illustration at p. 73 in Just So Stories (c1912).png|thumb|"Kipling would be riveted": the book explains how animals actually acquired the features that [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote about in his 1902 ''[[Just So Stories]]'', such as "How the Elephant got his Trunk".&lt;ref name=BioScience/&gt;]]

The evolutionary biologist [[Lewis Wolpert]], writing in ''[[American Scientist]]'', called ''Endless Forms Most Beautiful'' "a beautiful and very important book." He summarized the message of the book with the words "As Darwin's theory made clear, these multitudinous forms developed as a result of small changes in offspring and natural selection of those that were better adapted to their environment. Such variation is brought about by alterations in genes that control how cells in the developing embryo behave. Thus one cannot understand evolution without understanding its fundamental relation to development of the embryo." Wolpert noted that Carroll intended to explain evo-devo, and "has brilliantly achieved what he set out to do."&lt;ref name=Wolpert&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolpert |first1=Lewis |authorlink1=Lewis Wolpert |title=Clever Tinkering |journal=American Scientist |date=September 2005 |volume=93 |issue=5 |page=1 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/clever-tinkering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[Jerry Coyne]], writing in ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'', described the book as for the interested lay reader, and called it "a paean to recent advances in developmental genetics, and what they may tell us about the evolutionary process."&lt;ref name=Coyne&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Coyne | first1=J. A. | title=Switching on evolution | doi=10.1038/4351029a | journal=Nature | volume=435 | issue=7045 | pages=1029–1030| year=2005 | authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the centrepiece was "the unexpected discovery that the genes that control the body plans of all bilateral animals, including worms, insects, frogs and humans, are largely identical. These are the 'homeobox' (Hox) genes".&lt;ref name=Coyne/&gt; He called Carroll a leader in the field and an "adept communicator", but admits to "feeling uncomfortable"&lt;ref name=Coyne/&gt; when Carroll sets out his personal vision of the field "without admitting that large parts of that vision remain controversial."&lt;ref name=Coyne/&gt; Coyne pointed out that the idea that the "'regulatory gene' is the locus of evolution"&lt;ref name=Coyne/&gt; dates back to Roy Britten and colleagues around 1970, but was still weakly supported by observation or experiment. He granted that chimps and humans are almost 99% identical at DNA level, but points out that "humans and chimps have different amino-acid sequences in at least 55% of their proteins, a figure that rises to 95% for humans and mice. Thus we can't exclude protein-sequence evolution as an important reason why we lack whiskers and tails."&lt;ref name=Coyne/&gt; He also noted that nearly half of human protein-coding genes do not have homologues in fruit flies, so one could argue the opposite of Carroll's thesis and claim that "evolution of form is very much a matter of teaching old genes to make new genes."&lt;ref name=Coyne/&gt;

The review in ''[[BioScience]]'' noted that the book serves as a new ''[[Just So Stories]]'', explaining the "spots, stripes, and bumps" that had attracted [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s attention in his children's stories. The review praised Carroll for tackling human evolution and covering the key concepts of what [[Charles Darwin]] called the grandeur of [the evolutionary view of] life, suggesting that "Kipling would be riveted."&lt;ref name=BioScience&gt;{{cite journal |title=The New "Just So" Stories |journal=BioScience |date=2005 |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=898–899 |url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/10/898.full |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2005)055[0898:tnjss]2.0.co;2 | last1 = Mabee | first1 = Paula M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The science writer Peter Forbes, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', called it an "essential book" and its author "both a distinguished scientist ... and one of our great science writers."&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news |last1=Forbes |first1=Peter |title=The Serengeti Rules by Sean B Carroll review – a visionary book about how life works |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/23/the-serengeti-rules-sean-b-carroll-review |accessdate=15 April 2016 |agency=The Guardian |date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist Dick Pountain, writing in ''[[PC Pro]]'' magazine, argued that ''Endless Forms Most Beautiful'' was the most important popular science book since [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', "and in effect a sequel [to it]."&lt;ref name=Pountain&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pountain |first1=Dick |title=Nature's 3D printer exposes Pokemon Go as a hollow replica |journal=PC Pro |date=November 2016 |issue=265 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[paleobiology|paleobiologist]] [[Douglas H. Erwin]], reviewing the book for ''Artificial Life'', noted that life forms from fruit flies to humans have far fewer genes than many biologists expected – human beings have only some 20,000. "How could humans, in all our diversity of cell types and complexity of neurons, require essentially the same number of genes as a fly, or worse, a worm (the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'')?"&lt;ref name=Erwin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erwin |first1=Douglas J. |title=Book Review: Endless Forms Most Beautiful |journal=Artificial Life |date=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=87–89 |doi=10.1162/artl.2007.13.1.87}}&lt;/ref&gt; asks Erwin. He answered his own question about the "astonishing morphological diversity" of animals coming from "such a limited number of genes", praising Carroll's "insightful and enthusiastic" style, writing in a "witty and engaging" way, pulling the reader into the complexities of ''[[Hox (gene)|Hox]]'' and ''[[PAX-6]]'', as well as celebrating the Cambrian explosion of life forms and much else.&lt;ref name=Erwin/&gt;

The device has been the subject of demonstrations and tests several times, and commented on by various academics and others, but no independent tests have been made, and no peer-reviewed tests have been published. Steve Featherstone wrote in ''[[Popular Science]]'' that by the summer of 2012 Rossi's "outlandish claims" for the E-Cat seemed "thoroughly debunked".&lt;ref name=popsci2012/&gt;

== Demonstrations ==
Invited guests attended several demonstrations in [[Bologna]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Rai News May 5, 2011"/&gt; The device has not been independently verified. Of a January demonstration, [[Discovery Channel]] analyst [[Benjamin Radford]] wrote that "If this all sounds fishy to you, it should," and that "In many ways cold fusion is similar to perpetual motion machines. The principles defy the laws of physics, but that doesn't stop people from periodically claiming to have invented or discovered one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Phys.org]] (11 August 2011), the demonstrations held from January to April 2011 had several flaws that compromised their credibility and Rossi had refused to perform tests that could verify his claims.&lt;ref name="zyga"&gt;{{cite web|author=Zyga, Lisa|date=2011-08-11|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-08-controversial-energy-generating-lacking-credibility-video.html|title=Controversial energy-generating system lacking credibility (w/ video)|publisher= [[PhysOrg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Bologna researchers have attended some E-Cat demonstrations, but only as observers. On 5 November 2011, the University of Bologna clarified that its researchers had not been involved in the demonstrations and that none of those took place at the university. Rossi had signed a contract with the university, but the contract was terminated and no research was done because Rossi did not make the first payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.magazine.unibo.it/Magazine/Notizie/2011/11/05/Lecat_lUnivesita_di_Bologna_non_e_coinvolta.htm| title=E-cat: l'Università di Bologna non è coinvolta|language=Italian|publisher=UNIBO Magazine.

On 28 October 2011 the unit was "customer tested" and was said to release 2,635 kWh during five and a half hours of self-sustained mode, an average power of 479 kilowatts – just under half the promised power of one megawatt.

Because of his research into cold fusion for over 15 years, Sergio Focardi was contacted by Andrea Rossi in 2007 in order to validate the apparatus at its early stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilprice.com/Interviews/The-Limitless-Potential-of-the-E-Cat-An-Interview-with-Andrea-Rossi.html|title=The Limitless Potential of the E-Cat: An Interview with Andrea Rossi|accessdate=21 September 2012|author= James Burgess|date= 29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After four years of work and measurements together with Rossi, Focardi concluded that nuclear fusion reactions happen inside the Energy Catalyzer.

In the previous tests there were not enough {{chem|62|Ni}} and {{chem|64|Ni}} (the only two nickel [[isotopes]] which can fuse with hydrogen), at 3.6% and 0.9% respectively, in the reactants to explain the 10% copper output; these isotope levels are typical of natural copper, rather than of fusion by-product. According to Siegel, Rossi also refused to unplug the machine while it was operating despite it being an easy way to surreptitiously power the device. He also added that the supposedly independent testers had to rely on data supplied by Rossi.&lt;ref name=Siegel2&gt;{{cite web | authorlink=Ethan Siegel|last = Siegel | first = Ethan | title = The E-Cat is back, and people are still falling for it! | url = http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/05/21/the-e-cat-is-back-and-people-are-still-falling-for-it/ | website = [[ScienceBlogs]] | date = 21 May 2013 | accessdate = 23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 a non-peer-reviewed paper by the same authors as the May 2013 report describes results from evaluations in March 2014 of an upgraded version of the E-Cat which runs at higher temperatures. Unlike previous demonstrations, the test was carried out with monitoring equipment and in a laboratory not supplied by Rossi, and was run over an extended duration (32 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with the previous report, the authors were not in full control of the process; Rossi intervened during the insertion of the fuel charge, start up of the reactor, shut down of the reactor, and extraction of the spent fuel. Overall, the total excess heat measured was calculated to be well beyond that possible by any conventional, non-nuclear source. In this report, they present analyses of samples of spent fuel, concluding from the isotopes found that "nuclear reactions are therefore indicated to be present in the run process, which however is hard to reconcile with the fact that no radioactivity was detected outside the reactor during the run." Following fuel and ash isotopic analysis, the authors speculate that isotopes of especially [[nickel]] and [[lithium]] being part of the reaction, in particular transmutation of {{chem|58|Ni}} and {{chem|60|Ni}} to {{chem|62|Ni}}, and from {{chem|7|Li}} to {{chem|6|Li}} through some unknown process.

Particle physicist Tommaso Dorigo commented on the 2014 test, called the isotopic measurements "startling" but he expressed deep concern about Rossi being involved in collecting the spent fuel, that the testers may have "overlooked some simple trick" and that "given the extraordinary nature of the claim… this constitutes a major flaw, which totally invalidates any conclusions one might otherwise draw."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dorigo | first = Tommaso | title = Cold Fusion: A Better Study On The Infamous E-Cat | url = http://www.science20.com/a_quantum_diaries_survivor/cold_fusion_a_better_study_on_the_infamous_ecat-146700/ | website = [[Science20]] | date = 11 Oct 2014 | accessdate = 17 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Astrophysicist Ethan Siegel was highly critical of the test, stating that the testers were not independent, that Rossi could have tampered with the fuel samples, that the 'open calorimeter' set up used was inappropriate, and that "it’s relatively easy to fake the amount of energy being drawn through a power cord if there is a hookup to an external source."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink= Ethan Siegel | last = Siegel | first = Ethan | title = The E-cat, cold fusion or scientific fraud? | url = https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/the-e-cat-cold-fusion-or-scientific-fraud-624f15676f96/ | website = [[Medium (service)|Medium]] | date = 15 Oct 2014 | accessdate = 17 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions to the claims ==

Theoretical astrophysicist Ethan Siegel and nuclear physicist Peter Thieberger argue that the claims for the E-Cat are incompatible with the fundamentals of nuclear physics.&lt;ref name=ScienceBlogs1&gt;Ethan Siegel, 2011-12-05, [http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/12/05/the-nuclear-physics-of-why-we/   The Physics of why the E-Cat's Cold Fusion Claims Collapse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- dup; but now for other section of the article --&gt;  Jennifer Ouellette, [http://news.discovery.com/space/could-interstellar-starships-use-cold-fusion-propulsion-111223.html Could starships use cold fusion propulsion?]   // HowStuffWorks, ([http://science.howstuffworks.com/starships-use-cold-fusion-propulsion.htm/printable])&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[Coulomb barrier]] for the claimed fusion reaction is so high that it is insurmountable anywhere in the known universe, including the interior of stars. The reaction also would create [[gamma radiation]] that would have penetrated the few inches of shielding apparently provided by the E-Cat, inducing [[acute radiation syndrome]] in persons in the vicinity of the purported demonstrations.&lt;ref name=ScienceBlogs1/&gt; Given numerous other scientific inconsistencies – such as the ratio of isotopes in the supposed copper "fusion product" being identical to that in natural copper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2011/11/25/cold-fusion-is-it-possible-is/|title=Cold Fusion: Is it Possible?

Peter Ekström, lecturer at the Department of Nuclear Physics at Lund University in Sweden, concluded in May 2011, "I am convinced that the whole story is one big scam, and that it will be revealed in less than one year."&lt;ref name=ekstrom&gt;{{cite web|author=Ekström, Peter |date=6 May 2011 |title=Kall Fusion på italienska (Cold fusion – Italian style) |language=Swedish, English |url=http://www.fysik.org/WebSite/fragelada/resurser/cold_fusion.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515045927/http://www.fysik.org/WebSite/fragelada/resurser/cold_fusion.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited the unlikelihood of a chemical reaction being [[quantum tunnelling|strong enough to overcome]] the [[Coulomb barrier]], the lack of gamma rays, the lack of explanation for the origin of the extra energy, the lack of the expected radioactivity after fusing a proton with &lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;Ni, the unexplained occurrence of 11% iron in the spent fuel, the 10% copper in the spent fuel strangely having the same isotopic ratios as natural copper, and the lack of any unstable copper isotope in the spent fuel as if the reactor only produced stable isotopes.&lt;ref name=ekstrom /&gt; Kjell Aleklett, physics professor at [[Uppsala University]], said the percentage of copper was too high for any known reaction of nickel, and the copper had the same isotopic ratio as natural copper. He also stated, "Known chemical reactions cannot explain the amount of energy measured. A nuclear reaction can explain the amount of energy, but the knowledge we have today says that this reaction cannot take place."&lt;ref name=aleklett&gt;Aleklett, Kjell (11 April 2011).

Other reactions to the device have been mixed. In 2011 [[Dennis M. Bushnell]], Chief Scientist at [[NASA]] [[Langley Research Center]], described [[Cold fusion|LENR]] as a "promising" technology and praised the work of Rossi and Focardi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evworld.com/article.cfm?storyid=1983 The Future of Energy: Part 1] [http://www.evworld.com/evworld_audio/dennis_bushnell_part1.mp3 Podcast] [http://lenr.qumbu.com/110606_evworld_bushnell_interview_part1_v401A.php approved Transcript]. At 4 minutes and 34 seconds, Bushnell described several emerging energy technologies, but he identified LENR as "the most interesting and promising at this point". At 10 minutes and 35 seconds, Bushnell continued: "... in January of this year Rossi, backed by Focardi, who had been working on this for many years, and in fact doing some of the best work worldwide, came out and did a demonstration first in January, they re-did it in February, they re-did it in March, where for days they had one of these cells, a small cell, producing in the 10 to 15 kilowatts range, which is far more than enough heat to boil water for tea."&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical nuclear physicist Yeong E. Kim of [[Purdue University]] has proposed a potential theoretical explanation of the reported results of the device,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2665">An '''evaporative light scattering detector''' (ELSD) is a detector used in conjunction with [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC), [[Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography]] (UHPLC), [[Purification liquid chromatography]] such as flash or preparative chromatography, countercurrent or [[centrifugal partition]] chromatographies and [[Supercritical Fluid chromatography]] (SFC). It is commonly used for analysis of compounds where UV detection might be a restriction and therefore used where compounds do not efficiently absorb UV radiation, such as sugars, antivirals, antibiotics, fatty acids, lipids, oils, phospholipids, polymers, surfactants, terpenoids and triglycerides.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.waters.com/webassets/cms/support/docs/71500121802rb.pdf|title=2424 Evaporative Light Scattering Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Waters Corporation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Douville|first=V.|last2=Lodi|first2=A.|last3=Miller|first3=J.|last4=Nicolas|first4=A.|last5=Clarot|first5=I.|last6=Prilleux|first6=B.|last7=Megoulas|first7=N.|last8=Koupparis|first8=M.|date=2006-08-01|title=Evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD): a tool for improved quality control of drug substances|journal=Pharmeuropa Scientific Notes|volume=2006|issue=1|pages=9–15|issn=1814-2435|pmid=17694640}}&lt;/ref&gt; ELSDs is related to the [[Charged aerosol detector|charged aerosol detector (CAD)]] and like the CAD, falls under the category of destructive detectors&gt;

An '''evaporative light scattering detector''' (ELSD) is able to detect all compound which are less volatile than the mobile phase, i.e. non volatile and semi-volatile compounds. 

==Principles of operation==

ELSDs analyze solvent after elution from HPLC. As the eluent passes from an HPLC, it is mixed with an inert carrier gas and forced through a [[Analytical nebulizer|nebulizer]], which separates the liquid into minute aerosolized droplets. These droplets then pass into a heated drift tube, where the mobile phase solvent is evaporated off. As the [[mobile phase]] evaporates, the droplets become smaller and smaller until all that is left is minute particles of dried analyte. These particles are pushed through the drift tube by the carrier gas to the detection region. In this region, a beam of light crosses the column of analyte and the scattering of light is measured by a photodiode or photomultiplier tube. The detector's output is non-linear across more than one order of magnitude and proper calibration is required for quantitative analysis.&gt;BDS

The relaxation can be stimulated e.g. by slight heating or longwave illumination, not causing emission from untreated samples. Accordingly, thermo- and  photostimulated EE (TSEE, PSEE) are distinguished. Thus, EE is an electron emission analogue of such optical phenomena as [[phosphorescence]], thermo- and [[photostimulated luminescence]].

[[File:Expressive_therapies_continuum.png|frame|A diagram of the Expressive Therapies Continuum depicting all four levels of creative functioning, the fourth of which is displayed as a vertical line intersecting, and integrating, the previous three levels.]]

The '''expressive therapies continuum''' ('''ETC''') is a model of creative functioning&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lusebrink, V. (2010) Assessment and therapeutic application of the expressive therapies continuum: Implications for brain structures and functions. ''Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association, 27''(4), 168-177&lt;/ref&gt; used in the field of [[art therapy]] that is applicable to creative processes both within and outside of an expressive therapeutic setting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hinz, L. (2009). ''Expressive Therapies Continuum.'' New York: Taylor &amp; Francis Group&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was initially proposed and published in 1978 by art therapists Sandra Kagin and Vija Lusebrink, who based the continuum on existing models of [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and [[information processing]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kagin, S, and Lusebrink, V. (1978) The expressive therapies continuum. ''Art Psychotherapy, 5'', 171-180&lt;/ref&gt;

This schematic model serves to describe and assess an individual's level of creative functioning based on aspects such as the artist's purpose for creating a piece, choice of medium, interaction with the chosen medium, and imagery within the piece. Conversely, it also serves to meet the needs of the client by assisting the art therapist in choosing a developmentally or situationally appropriate activity or art medium.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, J. (1984). ''The Art of Art Therapy.'' Levittown, PA: Taylor &amp; Francis Group&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing an individual's art making process and the resulting artwork using the ETC, art therapists can assess strengths, weaknesses, and disconnect in various levels of a client's cognitive functioning - suggesting or substantiating diagnosis of, or recovery from, a mental health condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Levels of functioning==

According to Lusebrink:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first three levels of the ETC reflect three established systems of human information processing: the Kinesthetic/Sensory (K/S level); the Perceptual/Affective (P/A level); and the Cognitive/Symbolic (C/S level) ... The fourth level of the ETC is the Creative level (CR). It is seen as a synthesis of the other three levels of the continuum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A diagram of the ETC, as pictured in the top right of the page, can be read from left to right and from the bottom, upwards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The model flows in a direction that travels from simple information processing and image formation to increasingly complex thought processes and interactions with the media. Individuals can fluctuate from level to level depending on personal and situational factors. They may also display an integration of all of the first three levels of functioning. This integration indicates that the individual is operating on the fourth and final level of functioning, known as the Creative level. The Creative level both transcends and intersects the prior three levels, in which the individual is either equally incorporating all aspects of the ETC ''or'' is able to find a satisfying and meaningful creative experience on one of the three levels alone.

However, an individual cannot wholly operate at both ends of a level, as each level is bipolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC): Interdisciplinary bases of the ETC|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17454832.2012.713370|journal = International Journal of Art Therapy|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1745-4832|pages = 75–85|volume = 18|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/17454832.2012.713370|first = Vija Bergs|last = Lusebrink|first2 = Kristīne|last2 = Mārtinsone|first3 = Ilze|last3 = Dzilna-Šilova}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the individual is more focused on the quick and scribbly ''movement'' of a chalk-pastel on paper, then he or she is less focused on the ''sensory'' aspects of the media, such as the sound of the chalk against the paper or the powdery feel of chalk in one's hand.

===Kinesthetic/Sensory Level (K/S)===

As the first level of the ETC, the Kinesthetic/Sensory level is described as a form of preverbal information processing that is "rhythmic, tactile, and sensual".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This simple type of interaction with various art media stimulates primal areas of the brain and meets basic expressive needs—all while providing sensory and kinesthetic feedback for the artist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If an individual is operating at the kinesthetic end of the spectrum, he or she may find satisfaction in movement—i.e. pounding at a piece of clay or scribbling frantically with a crayon. In contrast, if the individual is gravitating towards the sensory end of the spectrum, he or she might take more pleasure in the ''feel'' of finger-paints or the ''smell'' of scented markers.

This level is particularly useful for young children but may also be useful for anyone needing to focus on sensorimotor skills. In addition, functioning at this level may allow for better access to preverbal memories or expression of extreme emotions. Individuals may identify operation at the K/S as a personal coping mechanism, in which the experience rather than the product is viewed as therapeutic.

===Perceptual/Affective Level (P/A)===

The second level of the ETC, the Perceptual/Affective level may or may not include verbal thought processes. However, the focus has shifted from the experience alone (with little focus on the outcome, as in the K/S level) to using the media to create an intentionally expressive or self-satisfying final product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The process may be characterized either by an individual's intent to express his or her own literal reality ''or'' be characterized by content that is "emotional and raw...without regard to form".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

By working with individuals at the P/A level, art therapists can help clients to perceive images or notions in a new way, strengthening communication and assisting with the formation of meaningful relationships. They can also focus on the identification and healthy expression of one's emotions.

===Cognitive/Symbolic Level===

Operation at the third level of the ETC, the cognitive/symbolic level, requires "complex and sophisticated" information processing, in which the individual consciously and strategically plans—prior to creating the art piece—for an expressive and self-satisfying final product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At this level, individuals are able to step outside their own sphere of perception and emotional expression and focus on ways that they interact with the world around them. They may begin to use satire and hidden meanings in their pieces to best express their unique response to their surroundings or situation (symbolic) or use art to plan and to problem-solve (cognitive).

===Creative level===

The final level, which either intersects the previous three levels or transcends above them, is the Creative level. This level symbolizes a wholeness, in which the individual achieves a sense of joy, fulfillment, or wellbeing by taking part in the creative process and expressing the self.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This may be accomplished through the integration of the three previous levels (where there was inclusion of all expressive operations in the art-making process; a feeling of oneness) or success in fulfilling an individual's need at any given level, which may be healing in and of itself.

[[File:Lycoperdon umbrinum.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Lycoperdon umbrinum]]'' is known as the umber-brown puffball. The folk taxonomic term [[puffball]] has no direct scientific equivalent, and does not slot precisely into scientific taxonomy.]]
A '''folk taxonomy''' is a [[vernacular]] [[name|naming system]], and can be contrasted with [[Taxonomy (general)|scientific taxonomy]]. Folk biological classification is the way people traditionally describe and organize their natural surroundings/the world around them, typically making generous use of [[form taxa]] like "[[shrub]]s", "[[arthropod|bug]]s", "[[duck]]s", "[[ungulate]]s" and the likes. [[Astrology]] involves a folk taxonomy, while [[astronomy]] uses a scientific classification system, although both involve observations of the stars and celestial bodies and both terms seem equally scientific, with the former meaning "the teachings about the stars" and the latter "the rules about the stars".
Folk taxonomies are generated from [[social knowledge]] and are used in everyday speech. They are distinguished from scientific taxonomies that claim to be disembedded from social relations and thus objective and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]].

[[cultural anthropology|Anthropologists]] have observed that taxonomies are generally embedded in local cultural and social systems, and serve various social functions. One of the most well-known and influential studies of folk taxonomies is [[Émile Durkheim]]'s ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''.

Folk taxonomies exist to allow popular identification of classes of objects, and apply to all areas of human activity. All parts of the world have their own systems of naming local plants and animals. These naming systems are a vital aid to survival and include information such as the fruiting patterns of trees and the habits of large mammals. These localised naming systems are folk taxonomies. [[Theophrastus]] recorded evidence of a Greek folk taxonomy for plants, but later formalized botanical taxonomies were laid out in the 18th century by [[Carl Linnaeus]].

Critics of the concept of "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]" in humans argue that race is a folk taxonomy rather than a [[scientific classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|last =  Montagu

|publisher = ''American Ethnography Quasimonthly''
|date = |origyear=1962
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists generally recognize that folk taxonomies conflict at times with [[Linnaean taxonomy]] or current interpretations of [[evolution]]ary relationships, and can tend to refer to generalized rather than quantitatively informative traits in an organism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27464">'''Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)''' (also '''functional enrichment analysis''') is a method to identify classes of [[genes]] or [[proteins]] that are over-represented in a large set of genes or proteins, and may have an association with disease [[phenotype]]s. The method uses statistical approaches to identify significantly enriched or depleted groups of genes. [[Transcriptomics technologies]] and [[proteomics]] results often identify thousands of genes which are used for the analysis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gene set enrichment analysis: A knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2005-10-25|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 1239896|pmid = 16199517|pages = 15545–15550|volume = 102|issue = 43|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0506580102|first = Aravind|last = Subramanian|first2 = Pablo|last2 = Tamayo|first3 = Vamsi K.|last3 = Mootha|first4 = Sayan|last4 = Mukherjee|first5 = Benjamin L.|last5 = Ebert|first6 = Michael A.|last6 = Gillette|first7 = Amanda|last7 = Paulovich|first8 = Scott L.|last8 = Pomeroy|first9 = Todd R.|last9 = Golub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers performing high-throughput experiments that yield sets of genes (for example, genes that are differentially [[Gene Expression|expressed]] under different conditions) often want to retrieve a functional profile of that gene set, in order to better understand the underlying biological processes. This can be done by comparing the input gene set to each of the bins (terms) in the [[gene ontology]] – a [[statistical test]] can be performed for each bin to see if it is enriched for the input genes.

== Background ==
While the completion of the [[Human Genome Project]] gifted researchers with an enormous amount of new information, it also left them with the problem of how to interpret and analyze the incredible amount of data. In order to seek out genes associated with diseases, researchers utilized [[DNA microarray]]s, which measure the amount of gene expression in different cells. Researchers would perform these microarrays on thousands of different genes, and compare the results of two different cell categories, e.g. normal cells versus cancerous cells.  However, this method of comparison is not sensitive enough to detect the subtle differences between the expression of individual genes, because diseases typically involve entire groups of genes. Multiple genes are linked to a single biological pathway, and so it is the additive change in expression within gene sets that leads to the difference in phenotypic expression. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was developed &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = PGC-1a-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes|last = Mootha|first = Vamsi K.|date = 2003|journal = Nature Genetics  |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=267–273|doi = 10.1038/ng1180 |pmid = 12808457|access-date = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; to focus on the changes of expression in groups of a priori defined gene sets.  By doing so, this method resolves the problem of the undetectable, small changes in the expression of single genes.

== Methods of GSEA ==
Gene set enrichment analysis uses ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' gene sets that have been grouped together by their involvement in the same biological pathway, or by proximal location on a chromosome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A database of these predefined sets can be found at the ''Molecular signatures database'' (MSigDB).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liberzon|first=Arthur|last2=Birger|first2=Chet|last3=Thorvaldsdóttir|first3=Helga|last4=Ghandi|first4=Mahmoud|last5=Mesirov|first5=Jill P.|last6=Tamayo|first6=Pablo|date=2015-12-23|title=The Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark Gene Set Collection|url=http://www.cell.com/article/S2405471215002185/abstract|journal=Cell Systems|volume=1|issue=6|pages=417–425|doi=10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.004|issn=2405-4712|pmc=4707969|pmid=26771021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSig"&gt;{{cite web|title=Molecular signature database (MSigDB) 3.0 (PDF Download Available)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51101962|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In GSEA, DNA microarrays, or now [[RNA-Seq]], are still performed and compared between two cell categories, but instead of focusing on individual genes in a long list, the focus is put on a gene set.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Researchers analyze whether the majority of genes in the set fall in the extremes of this list: the top and bottom of the list correspond to the largest differences in expression between the two cell types. If the gene set falls at either the top (over-expressed) or bottom (under-expressed), it is thought to be related to the phenotypic differences.

In the method that is typically referred to as standard GSEA, there are three steps involved in the analytical process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general steps are summarized below:

# Calculate the ''enrichment score'' (ES) that represents the amount to which the genes in the set are over-represented at either the top or bottom of the list. This score is a [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test|Kolmogorov–Smirnov]]-like statistic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Estimate the statistical significance of the ES. This calculation is done by a phenotypic-based permutation test in order to produce a null distribution for the ES. The P value is determined by comparison to the null distribution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#*Calculating the statistical significance in this way "provides a more biologically reasonable assessment"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Adjust for multiple hypothesis testing for when a large number of gene sets are being analyzed at one time. The enrichment scores for each set are normalized and a false discovery rate is calculated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Limitations and proposed alternatives to standard GSEA ===

==== SEA ====
When GSEA was first proposed in 2003 some immediate concerns were raised regarding its methodology. These criticisms led to the use of the correlation-weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, the normalized ES, and the false discovery rate calculation, all of which are the factors that currently define standard GSEA.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tamayo|first=Pablo|last2=Steinhardt|first2=George|last3=Liberzon|first3=Arthur|last4=Mesirov|first4=Jill P.|date=2016-02-01|title=The limitations of simple gene set enrichment analysis assuming gene independence|url=http://smm.sagepub.com/content/25/1/472|journal=Statistical Methods in Medical Research|volume=25|issue=1|pages=472–487|doi=10.1177/0962280212460441|issn=0962-2802|pmc=3758419|pmid=23070592|arxiv=1110.4128}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, GSEA has now also been criticized for the fact that its null distribution is superfluous, and too difficult to be worth calculating, as well as the fact that its Kolmogorov–Smirnov-like statistic is not as sensitive as the original.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As an alternative, the method known as Singular Enrichment Analysis (SEA), was proposed. This method assumes gene independence and uses a simpler approach to calculate t-test. However, it is thought that these assumptions are in fact too simplifying, and gene correlation cannot be disregarded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== SGSE ====
One other limitation to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis is that the results are very dependent on the algorithm that clusters the genes, and the number of clusters being tested.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frost|first=H Robert|last2=Li|first2=Zhigang|last3=Moore|first3=Jason H|date=2015-03-03|title=Spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE)|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/16/70|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=16|issue=1|pages=70|doi=10.1186/s12859-015-0490-7|pmc=4365810|pmid=25879888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectral Gene Set Enrichment (SGSE) is a proposed, unsupervised test. The method’s founders claim that it is a better way to find associations between MSigDB gene sets and microarray data. The general steps include:

1.    Calculating the association between principal components and gene sets.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

2.    Using the weighted Z-method to calculate association between the gene sets and the spectral structure of the data.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Tools for performing GSEA ==
GSEA uses complicated statistics, so it requires a computer program to run the calculations. However, because GSEA has become standard practice in the last decade, there are many websites and downloadable programs that will provide the data sets and run the analysis.

=== PlantRegMap===
The [[gene ontology]] (GO) annotation for 165 plant species and GO enrichment analysis is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PlantRegMap: Plant Regulation Data and Analysis Platform @ CBI, PKU|url=http://plantregmap.cbi.pku.edu.cn/go.php|website=plantregmap.cbi.pku.edu.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MSigDB ===
The Molecular Signatures Database hosts an extensive collection of annotated gene sets that can be used with most GSEA Software.

=== Broad Institute ===
The Broad Institute website is in cooperation with MSigDB and has a downloadable GSEA software, as well a general tutorial for those new to performing this analytical technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GSEA {{!}} Desktop Tutorial|url=http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/desktop_tutorial.jsp|website=software.broadinstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enrichr ===
Enrichr is a gene set enrichment analysis tool for mammalian gene sets. It contains background libraries for transcription regulation, pathways and protein interactions, ontologies including GO and the human and mouse phenotype ontologies, signatures from cells treated with drugs, and expression of genes in different cells and tissues. Enrichr was developed by the Ma'ayan laboratory at Mount Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ma'ayan Laboratory - Computational Systems Biology - Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai|url=http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/maayanlab/|website=labs.icahn.mssm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background libraries are from over 70 resources and contain over 200,000 annotated gene sets.

== Applications and results of GSEA ==

=== GSEA and genome-wide association studies ===
[[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s, or SNPs, are single base mutations that may be associated with diseases. One base change has the potential to affect the protein that results from that gene being expressed; however, it also has the potential to have no effect at all. [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] are comparisons between healthy and disease genotypes to try to find SNPs that are overrepresented in the disease genomes, and might be associationed with that condition. Before GSEA, the accuracy of genome-wide SNP association studies was severely limited by a high number of false positives.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Marit|last2=Deng|first2=Shiwei|last3=Wojnowski|first3=Leszek|last4=Kulle|first4=Bettina|date=2008-12-01|title=GSEA-SNP: applying gene set enrichment analysis to SNP data from genome-wide association studies|url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/23/2784|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=24|issue=23|pages=2784–2785|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btn516|issn=1367-4803|pmid=18854360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that the SNPs contributing to a disease tend to be grouped in a set of genes that are all involved in the same biological pathway, is what the GSEA-SNP method is based on. This application of GSEA does not only aid in the discovery of disease-associated SNPs, but helps illuminate the corresponding pathways and mechanisms of the diseases.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== GSEA and Spontaneous Preterm Birth ===
Gene Set Enrichment methods led to the discovery of new suspect genes and biological pathways related to the Spontaneous Preterm Birth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 242: Gene set enrichment investigation of maternal exome variation in spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB)|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002937815015859|journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|pages = S142–S143|volume = 214|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2015.10.280|first = Tracy A.|last = Manuck|first2 = Scott|last2 = Watkins|first3 = M. Sean|last3 = Esplin|first4 = Samuel|last4 = Parry|first5 = Heping|last5 = Zhang|first6 = Hao|last6 = Huang|first7 = Joseph R.|last7 = Biggio|first8 = Radek|last8 = Bukowski|first9 = George|last9 = Saade|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exome sequencing|Exome]] sequences from women who had experienced SPTB were compared to those from females from the 1000 Genome Project, using a tool that scored possible disease-causing variants. Genes with higher scores were then run through different programs to group them into gene sets based on pathways and ontology groups. This study found that the variants were significantly clustered in sets related to several pathways, all suspects in SPTB.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== GSEA and cancer cell profiling ===
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis can be used to understand the changes that cells undergo during carcinogenesis and metastasis. In a study, microarrays were performed on renal cell carcinoma metastases, primary renal tumors, and normal kidney tissue, and the data was analyzed using GSEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maruschke|first=Matthias|last2=Hakenberg|first2=Oliver W|last3=Koczan|first3=Dirk|last4=Zimmermann|first4=Wolfgang|last5=Stief|first5=Christian G|last6=Buchner|first6=Alexander|date=2014-01-01|title=Expression profiling of metastatic renal cell carcinoma using gene set enrichment analysis|journal=International Journal of Urology|volume=21|issue=1|pages=46–51|doi=10.1111/iju.12183|pmid=23634695|issn=1442-2042}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis showed significant changes of expression in genes involved in pathways that have not been previously associated with the progression of renal cancer. From this study, GSEA has provided potential new targets for renal cell carcinoma therapy.&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;

=== GSEA and schizophrenia ===
GSEA can be used to help understand the molecular mechanisms of complex disorders. Schizophrenia is a largely heritable disorder, but is also very complex, and the onset of the disease involves many genes interacting within multiple pathways, as well the interaction of those genes with environmental factors. For instance, epigenetic changes, like DNA methylation, are affected by the environment, but are also inherently dependent on the DNA itself. DNA methylation is the most well-studied epigenetic change, and was recently analyzed using GSEA in relation to schizophrenia-related intermediate phenotypes.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hass|first=Johanna|last2=Walton|first2=Esther|last3=Wright|first3=Carrie|last4=Beyer|first4=Andreas|last5=Scholz|first5=Markus|last6=Turner|first6=Jessica|last7=Liu|first7=Jingyu|last8=Smolka|first8=Michael N.|last9=Roessner|first9=Veit|date=2015-06-03|title=Associations between DNA methylation and schizophrenia-related intermediate phenotypes — A gene set enrichment analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027858461500007X|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|volume=59|pages=31–39|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2015.01.006|pmc=4346504|pmid=25598502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers ranked genes for their correlation between methylation patterns and each of the phenotypes. They then used GSEA to look for an enrichment of genes that are predicted to be targeted by microRNAs in the progression of the disease.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== GSEA and depression ===
GSEA can help provide molecular evidence for the association of biological pathways with diseases. Previous studies shown that long-term depression symptoms are correlated with changes in immune response and inflammatory pathways.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elovainio|first=Marko|last2=Taipale|first2=Tuukka|last3=Seppälä|first3=Ilkka|last4=Mononen|first4=Nina|last5=Raitoharju|first5=Emma|last6=Jokela|first6=Markus|last7=Pulkki-Råback|first7=Laura|last8=Illig|first8=Thomas|last9=Waldenberger|first9=Melanie|title=Activated immune–inflammatory pathways are associated with long-standing depressive symptoms: Evidence from gene-set enrichment analyses in the Young Finns Study|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022395615002782|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=71|pages=120–125|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.09.017|pmid=26473696|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Elovainio et al. was aimed at finding genetic and molecular evidence that supports this association. The researchers took blood samples from the Young Finns Study (participants were depression patients), and used genome-wide expression data, along with GSEA to find expression differences in gene sets related to inflammatory pathways. The study found that patients who rated with the most severe depression symptoms also had significant expression differences in those gene sets, and this result supports the association hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''''Houben-Weyl Methods of Organic Chemistry''''' (Ger. ''Methoden der Organischen Chemie'') established in 1909 by the German chemist [[Theodor Weyl]], is a classic chemistry text. It consisted initially of two volumes and covered literature published as early as 1834. [[Heinrich Hubert Maria Josef Houben|Heinrich J. Houben]] revised and reissued it in 1913. It is considered one of the most significant resources for chemists.

Up to the 4th edition the work was published in German by [[Thieme Medical Publishers|Thieme]] from 1952 to 1987, with supplementary volumes published between 1982 and 1999, some of them (from 1990 on) in English. It consists of 16 volumes, some of which are further divided. Overall, the 4th edition consists of 90 individual books.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thieme.de/en/thieme-chemistry/sos-houben-weyl-54792.htm ''What is Houben-Weyl?'' Description of the publisher] Retrieved 3 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A new English-language edition was published by Thieme from 2000 to 2010 as ''Science of Synthesis'' in 48 volumes. It is constantly updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Book reviews |url=http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayHTMLArticleforfree.cfm?JournalCode=P1&amp;Year=2002&amp;ManuscriptID=b207785j&amp;Iss=19 |journal=Journal of the Chemistry Society, Perkin Transactions |volume=1 |year=2002 |pages=2204–2206 |doi=10.1039/b207785j |accessdate=21 August 2009 |last1=Page |first1=M.

'''''How It Began: A Time Traveler’s Guide to the Universe ''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by the [[astronomer]] [[Chris Impey]] that discusses the [[history of the universe]], with chapters ranging from the proximate [[universe]] to within an iota of the [[big bang]]. It was published as a hardcover by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] in 2012 and as a paperback in 2013.

==Summary==
How It Began: A Time Traveler’s Guide to the Universe is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[astronomy]] professor [[Chris Impey]] on the origins of everything from the [[Moon]] to the [[universe]] itself. The finite [[speed of light]] and the vastness of space turn modern [[large telescopes]] into time machines and [[astronomers]] into armchair [[time travel]]ers. Looking out in space is looking back in time. Each chapter has vignettes that place the reader in increasingly unfamiliar physical situations that are increasingly unfamiliar. How It Began has an associated web site containing source material on each major topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebookofbeginnings.com|title=How It Began|authors=Chris Impey, Kevin Hardegree-Ullman|date=2012|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first third of the book deals with the proximate universe. The journey starts with the [[giant impact hypothesis|Moon and its formation]] from an impact with the infant Earth. Next stop is the [[outer Solar System]] and the amazing process by particles of dust grew into [[planets]]. The nearest star is the place where star formation is considered, followed by the [[Orion Nebula]], where young stars are forming at a furious rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/science/formation_of_stars/|title=The formation of stars|author=Hans Zinnecker|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last stop in the nearby universe is the [[galactic center|center of our galaxy]], site of a [[black hole]] four million times the mass of the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ghezgroup/gc/research/index.html|title=UCLA Galactic Center Group|author=Andrea Ghez|date=2013|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second third of the book examines the remote universe. [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]] is seen as it was before humans evolved on the plains of [[Africa]], and [[galaxies]] are all seen over time spans that dwarf our existence. The next stop is the massive [[Coma cluster]] of galaxies, a swarm of thousands of galaxies bound by invisible [[dark matter]]. This section continues with a visit to galaxies that created their stars long before the Earth formed and it finished with the time when stars first congealed out of gas in the [[expanding universe]], 200 million years after the [[big bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/firstlight.html|title=Webb Science: The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization|author=NASA|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last third of the book ventures into the alien universe. The [[microwave background radiation]] is a relic of time when stable atoms first formed and the “fog lifted” in the infant universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/sgoals_universe.html|title=The WMAP Achievement:A DETAILED PICTURE OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE|author=NASA|date=April 16, 2010|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaching back to the time when the universe was as hot as the core of a star, the big bang is manifested in the creation of [[helium]]. The last chapters of the book cross into the realm of speculation, with descriptions the tiny asymmetry in the forces of nature that led to a tiny excess of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]], the early exponential expansion that [[Kerr metric|flattened space-time]], and the idea of the universe as one [[quantum]] event among many.

==Reception==
How It Began received strong reviews. Writing in the [[Wall Street Journal]], Manjit Kumar wrote “In clear, enthusiastic and occasionally lyrical prose, Mr. Impey takes the reader on a mind-blowing tour back through eons, stopping along the way to explain the [[formation of the solar system]], the [[stellar evolution|birth and death of stars]], [[white dwarfs]], [[supernovas]], [[spiral galaxies]], [[cosmic inflation]], [[string theory]], [[black holes]] and [[M-theory]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304459804577285901885706224|title=Echoes of The Big Bang|author=Manjit Kumar|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2013|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maclean's]] magazine notes “With Impey flexing his creative writing muscles, How It Began could almost be a [[science fiction]] novel. But when he describes what we really do know about the universe—and questions we’re grappling with—it’s even more incredible than anything a science fiction writer could dream up”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/06/12/review-how-it-began-a-time-travelers-guide-to-the-universe/|title=REVIEW: How It Began: A Time-Traveler’s Guide to the Universe|author=Kate Lunau|date=June 12, 2012|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction author [[Ben Bova]] said “Chris Impey has achieved the near-impossible: an accurate, up-to-date account of ‘the state of the universe’ that is told in gripping human terms. A great achievement and a ‘must-read’ book.” [[Kirkus Reviews]] concluded its review with “An astute tour of the cosmos by a skillful teacher.”

'''HyShot''' is a research project of The [[University of Queensland]], [[Australia]] [http://hypersonics.mechmining.uq.edu.au/ Centre for Hypersonics], to demonstrate the possibility of supersonic combustion under flight conditions using two scramjet engines, one designed by The University of Queensland and one designed by QinetiQ (formerly the MOD's Defence Evaluation &amp; Research Agency).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael K. Smart, Neal E. Hass, and Allan Paull.  "Flight Data Analysis of the HyShot 2 Scramjet Flight Experiment", AIAA Journal, Vol. 44, No. 10 (2006), pp. 2366-2375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British scramjet engine prepares for Australian space tests |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=2350 |publisher=[[The University of Queensland]] |format= |date=2012-09-17 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The project has involved the successful launch of one engine designed by The University of Queensland, and one launch of the [[scramjet]] designed by the British company [[QinetiQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=2350 |title=British scramjet engine prepares for Australian space tests |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each combustion unit was launched on the nose of a [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]]-[[Orion (rocket)|Orion]] Mk70 [[sounding rocket]] on a high [[ballistics|ballistic]] trajectory, reaching altitudes of approximately 330&amp;nbsp;km.  The rocket was rotated to face the ground, and the combustion unit ignited for a period of 6–10 seconds while falling between 35&amp;nbsp;km and 23&amp;nbsp;km at around [[Mach number|Mach]]&amp;nbsp;7.6.  The system is not designed to produce thrust.

* The first HyShot flight was on 30 October 2001 but was a failure due to the rocket going off course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4832254.stm |title=Revolutionary jet engine tested |work=BBC News |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first successful launch (Hyshot II) was of a University of Queensland scramjet on 30 July 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is believed by many to be the first successful flight of a [[scramjet]] engine, although some dispute this and point primarily to earlier tests by [[Russia]]n scientists.&lt;ref&gt;A.Roudakov,
 V.Semenov, J.Hicks "Recent Flight Test Results of the Joint CIAMNASA 
Mach 6.5 Scramjet Flight Program" NASA/TP-1998-206548.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A second successful flight (HyShot III) using a [[QinetiQ]] scramjet was achieved on 25 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=9258 |title=HyShot scramjet experiment blasts off in South Australian desert |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later QinetiQ prototype is cylindrical with four stainless steel combustors around the outside.  The aerodynamics of the vehicle is improved by this arrangement but it was expensive to manufacture.
* The HyShot IV flight on 30 March 2006 launched successfully, and telemetry was received, however it is believed that the scramjet did not function as expected. Data analysis is required to confirm what occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=9303 |title=HyShot™4 scramjet experiment lifts off |work=UQ News |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* HyCAUSE was launched on 15 June 2007. (The HyCAUSE experiment differed from the HyShot launches in that a Talos-Castor combination was used for launch and the target Mach number was 10.)
The carrier rocket for the HyShot experiments was composed of a [[RIM-2 Terrier]] first stage (6 second burn, 4000&amp;nbsp;km/h) and an [[Orion (US-rocket)|Orion]] second stage (26 second burn, 8600&amp;nbsp;km/h, 56&amp;nbsp;km altitude).  A fairing over the payload was then jettisoned.  The package then coasted to an altitude of around 300&amp;nbsp;km. Cold gas [[nitrogen]] [[attitude control]] [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] were used to re-orient the payload for [[atmospheric reentry]].  The experiments each lasted for some 5 seconds as the payload descended between approximately 35 and 23 kilometers altitude, when [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel was fed to the scramjet. [[Telemetry]] reported results to receivers on the ground for later analysis.  The payload landed about 400&amp;nbsp;km down range from the launch site, at which time its temperature was still expected to be about 300 degrees Celsius, which may be enough to cause a small brush fire and thereby make spotting and recovery easier even though a [[radio beacon]] was in the payload.

There has been much analysis of the data obtained in flight and comparison with results from experiments conducted in ground-testing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, AD; Hannemann, K; Paull, A; Steelant, J "Post flight analysis of the HyShot supersonic combustion flight experiment in HEG", In: Proceedings of the Fifth European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics for Space Vehicles. Editor: Danesy, D. ESA SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS, Volume: 563, Pages: 535-540. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The team continue to work as part of the [[Australian Hypersonics Initiative]], a joint program of The [[University of Queensland]], the [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of New South Wales]]' [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] campus, the governments of [[Government of Queensland|Queensland]] and [[Government of South Australia|South Australia]] and the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian Defence Department]].

The Hyshot program spawned the [[HyCAUSE]] (Hypersonic Collaborative Australian/United States Experiment) program [http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=5546]: a collaborative effort between the United States’ Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) and Australia's [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO), also representing the research collaborators in the Australian Hypersonics Initiative (AHI)[http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/news/5118/].

All tests were conducted at the [[Woomera Test Range]] in [[South Australia]].

==HIFiRE program==
[[File:HiFire5b badge.jpg|thumb|right|Badge of the HiFire 5b launch program.]]
The Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE) program was created jointly by DSTO and the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] (AFRL). HIFiRE was formed to investigate hypersonic flight technology, the fundamental science and technology required, and its potential for next generation aeronautical systems.  This will involve up to ten flights with The [[University of Queensland]] involved in at least the first three:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Centre for Hypersonics - HyShot Flight Program &amp; HIFiRE program |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/hypersonics/index.html?page=19501 |publisher=[[The University of Queensland]] |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HYDRODYNAMICA, Danielis Bernoulli.png|thumb|right|Front page of Daniel Bernoulli's ''Hydrodynamica''.]]

'''''Hydrodynamica''''' ([[Latin]] for ''Hydrodynamics'') is a book published by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738.&lt;ref name="mikhailov"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mikhailov|2005|pp=131–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of this book eventually christened the field of fluid mechanics as [[hydrodynamics]].

The book deals with fluid mechanics and is organized around the idea of [[conservation of energy]], as received from [[Christiaan Huygens]]'s formulation of this principle. The book describes the theory of water flowing through a tube and of water flowing from a hole in a container. In doing so, Bernoulli explained the nature of hydrodynamic pressure and discovered the role of loss of ''vis viva'' in fluid flow, which would later be known as the [[Bernoulli principle]]. The book also discusses hydraulic machines and introduces the notion of work and efficiency of a machine. In the tenth chapter, Bernoulli discussed the first model of the [[kinetic theory of gases]]. Assuming that heat increases the velocity of the gas particles, he demonstrated that the pressure of air is proportional to kinetic energy of gas particles, thus making the temperature of gas proportional to this kinetic energy as well.&lt;ref name="mikhailov"/&gt;

ImageJ can be run as an online [[applet]], a downloadable application, or on any computer with a Java 5 or later [[virtual machine]]. Downloadable distributions are available for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[classic Mac OS]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], and the [[Sharp Zaurus|Sharp Zaurus PDA]].

The project developer, Wayne Rasband, retired from the Research Services Branch of the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] in 2010, but continues to develop the software.

==Features==
ImageJ can display, edit, analyze, process, save, and print [[indexed color|8-bit color]] and grayscale, [[64-bit color|16-bit integer]], and [[high dynamic range imaging|32-bit floating point]] images. It can read many [[image file formats]], including [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[GIF]], [[JPEG]], [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[DICOM]], and [[FITS]], as well as raw formats. ImageJ supports image ''stacks'', a series of images that share a single window, and it is [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreaded]], so time-consuming operations can be performed in parallel on multi-CPU hardware. ImageJ can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections and intensity-thresholded objects. It can measure distances and angles. It can create density [[histogram]]s and [[line chart|line profile plots]]. It supports standard image processing functions such as logical and arithmetical operations between images, contrast manipulation, [[convolution]], [[Fourier analysis]], sharpening, [[smoothing]], edge detection, and [[median filter]]ing. It does [[affine transformation|geometric transformations]] such as [[image scaling|scaling]], rotation, and flips. The program supports any number of images simultaneously, limited only by available memory.

==History==

Before the release of ImageJ in 1997, a similar freeware image analysis program known as ''NIH Image'' had been developed in [[Object Pascal]] for [[Macintosh]] computers running pre-[[OS X]] operating systems. Further development of this code continues in the form of [[Image SXM]], a variant tailored for physical research of scanning microscope images. A [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version – [[porting|ported]] by Scion Corporation (now defunct), so-called ''Scion Image for Windows'' – was also developed. Both versions are still available but – in contrast to NIH Image – closed-source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imagej.nih.gov/nih-image/about.html |title=NIH Image: About |accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6972">In [[optics]], an '''index-matching material''' is a substance, usually a liquid, cement (adhesive), or [[gel]], which has an [[index of refraction]] that closely approximates that of another object (such as a lens, material, fiber-optic, etc.).

When two substances with the same index are in contact, light passes from one to the other with neither [[fresnel reflection|reflection]] nor [[refraction]]. As such, they are used for various purposes in science, engineering, and art.

For example, in a popular home experiment, a glass rod is made almost invisible by immersing it in an index-matched transparent fluid such as [[mineral spirits]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optics4kids.org/home/content/classroom-activities/medium/lose-a-glass-in-a-glass/ Optics For Kids - "Lose a glass in a glass" home experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In microscopy==
{{main|Oil immersion}}

In [[optical microscope|light microscopy]], oil immersion is a technique used to increase the [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of a [[microscope]]. This is achieved by immersing both the [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] and the specimen in a transparent oil of high [[refractive index]], thereby increasing the [[numerical aperture]] of the objective lens.

Immersion oils are transparent oils that have specific optical and [[viscosity]] characteristics necessary for use in microscopy. Typical oils used have an [[index of refraction]] around  1.515.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympusmicro.com/primer/anatomy/immersion.html "Microscope Objectives: Immersion Media"] by Mortimer Abramowitz  and Michael W. Davidson, ''[[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] Microscopy Resource Center'' (website), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; An oil immersion objective is an objective lens specially designed to be used in this way. The index of the oil is typically chosen to match the index of the microscope lens glass, and of the [[cover slip]].

For more details, see the main article, [[oil immersion]]. Some microscopes also use other index-matching materials besides oil; see [[water immersion objective]] and [[solid immersion lens]].

In fiber optics and [[telecommunications]], an index-matching material may be used in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: [[Optical fiber connector]]). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 [[decibel|dB]] (''i.e.,'' 14&amp;nbsp;dB below the optical power of the incident [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]]). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog [[baseband]] [[Amplitude|intensity]]-modulated [[video]] signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital [[optical receiver]] except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a [[Distributed Feedback Laser]] may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10&amp;nbsp;dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.

For some applications, instead of standard polished connectors (e.g. FC/PC), angle polished connectors (e.g. FC/APC) may be used, whereby the non-perpendicular polish angle greatly reduces the ratio of reflected signal launched into the guided mode even in the case of a fiber-air interface.

==In experimental fluid dynamics==
{{main|Fluid dynamics}}

Index matching is used in liquid-liquid and liquid-solid ([[Multiphase flow]]) experimental systems to minimise the distortions that occur in these systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A review of solid–fluid selection options for optical-based measurements in single-phase liquid, two-phase liquid–liquid and multiphase solid–liquid flows|authors=Wright, S.F., Zadrazil, I. &amp; Markides, C.N.|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00348-017-2386-y |journal=Experiments in Fluids |year=2017|volume=58 |pages=108|bibcode=2017ExFl...58..108W|doi=10.1007/s00348-017-2386-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;, this is particularly important for systems with many interfaces which become optically inaccessible. Matching the refractive index minimises [[reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[diffraction]] and rotations that occurs at the interfaces allowing access to regions that would otherwise be inaccessible to optical measurements. This is particularly important for advanced optical measurements like [[Laser-induced fluorescence]], [[Particle image velocimetry]] and [[Particle tracking velocimetry]] to name a few.

==In art conservation==
{{see also|Conservation and restoration of glass objects}}
If a sculpture is broken into several pieces, [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|art conservators]] may reattach the pieces using an adhesive such as [[Paraloid B-72]] or [[epoxy]]. If the sculpture is made of a transparent or semitransparent material (such as glass), the seam where the pieces are attached will usually be much less noticeable if the refractive index of the adhesive matches the refractive index of the surrounding object. Therefore, art conservators may measure the index of objects and then use an index-matched adhesive. Similarly, losses (missing sections) in transparent or semitransparent objects are often filled using an index-matched material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Controlling the refractive index of epoxy adhesives |authors=John M. Messinger and Peter T. Lansbury |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic28-02-006.html |journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation |year=1989 |volume=28 |number=2 |pages=127–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In optical component adhesives==
Certain optical components, such as a [[Wollaston prism]] or [[Nicol prism]], are made of multiple transparent pieces that are directly attached to each other. The adhesive is usually index-matched to the pieces. Historically, [[Canada balsam]] was used in this application, but it is now more common to use [[epoxy]] or other synthetic adhesives.

== Birds ==
{{see also|:Category:Birds of the Colombian Andes}}
Colombia is the country with the most recorded bird species (1912 as of 2014) in the world.&lt;ref name=ProAves&gt;[http://www.proaves.org/1912-bird-species-in-colombia-available-online/?lang=en 1912 bird species in Colombia available online] – ProAves.org&lt;/ref&gt; The [[biodiversity]] of bird species in the Eastern Hills is higher than in the parks of urban Bogotá. The northern part of the reserve is richer in bird species due to the dense forests and larger space between the urban zones. Birds of 30 families, 92 genera and 119 species have been identified in the Eastern Hills.&lt;ref name=AlcaldiaBogota/&gt; A study in 2011 provided data on 67 species in an area of {{convert|75|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref name=Peraza_p58&gt;Peraza, 2011, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; The observation stations were between {{convert|2674|m|ft}} and {{convert|3065|m|ft}} in elevation.&lt;ref name=Peraza_p59&gt;Peraza, 2011, p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32997">Here is a list of the largest optical [[refracting telescope]]s sorted by lens diameter and focal length.

The largest practical functioning refracting telescope is the [[Yerkes Observatory]] 40&amp;nbsp;inch (102&amp;nbsp;cm) refractor, used for astronomical and scientific observation for over a century.

Most are classical [[Great refractors]], which used [[achromatic doublet]]s on an equatorial mount. However, other large refractors include a 21st-century Solar telescope which is not directly comparable because it uses a single element non-achromatic lens, and the short-lived [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]]. It used a 78-inch (200&amp;nbsp;cm) Focault siderostat for aiming light into the [[Image-forming optical system]] part of the telescope, which had a 125&amp;nbsp;cm diameter lens. Using a siderostat incurs a reflective loss.  Larger meniscus lenses have been used in later [[catadioptric]] telescopes which mix refractors and reflectors in the image-forming part of the telescope. As with reflecting telescopes, there was an ongoing struggle to balance cost with size, quality, and usefulness.

:''This list is of all known and predicted [[scalar meson|scalar]], [[pseudoscalar meson|pseudoscalar]] and [[vector meson|vector]] [[meson]]s. See [[list of particles]] for a more detailed list of particles found in [[particle physics]].''

This article contains a '''list of mesons''', unstable [[subatomic particle]]s composed of one [[quark]] and one [[antiquark]]. They are part of the [[hadron]] particle family – particles made of quarks. The other members of the hadron family are the [[baryon]]s – subatomic particles composed of three quarks. The main difference between [[meson]]s and baryons is that mesons have integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (thus are [[boson]]s) while baryons are [[fermion]]s (half-integer spin). [[Spin-statistics theorem|Because mesons are bosons]], the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] does not apply to them. Because of this, they can act as [[force carrier|force mediating particle]]s on short distances, and thus play a part in processes such as the [[nuclear interaction]].

Since mesons are composed of quarks, they participate in both the [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[strong interaction]]s. Mesons with net [[electric charge]] also participate in the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. They are classified according to their quark content, [[total angular momentum]], [[parity (physics)|parity]], and various other properties such as [[C-parity]] and [[G-parity]]. While no meson is stable, those of lower [[mass]] are nonetheless more stable than the most massive mesons, and are easier to observe and study in [[particle accelerator]]s or in [[cosmic ray]] experiments. They are also typically less massive than baryons, meaning that they are more easily produced in experiments, and will exhibit higher-energy phenomena sooner than baryons would. For example, the charm quark was first seen in the [[J/ψ meson|J/Psi meson]] ({{Subatomic particle|J/psi}}) in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Aubert ''et al.'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Augustin ''et al.'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; and the bottom quark in the [[upsilon meson]] ({{Subatomic particle|Upsilon}}) in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;S.W. Herb ''et al.'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

Each meson has a corresponding [[antiparticle]] (antimeson) where quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks and vice versa. For example, a positive [[pion]] ({{Subatomic particle|Pion+}}) is made of one up quark and one down antiquark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the negative pion ({{Subatomic particle|Pion-}}), is made of one up antiquark and one down quark. Some experiments show the evidence of ''[[tetraquark]]s'' – "exotic" mesons made of two quarks and two antiquarks, but the particle physics community as a whole does not view their existence as likely, although still possible.&lt;ref name=PDGTetraquarks2008&gt;C. Amsler ''et al.'' (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/charmonium_states_m801.pdf Charmonium States]&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbols encountered in these lists are: I (''[[isospin]]''), J (''[[total angular momentum]]''), P (''[[parity (physics)|parity]]''), C (''[[C-parity]]''), G (''[[G-parity]]''), u (''[[up quark]]''), d (''[[down quark]]''), s (''[[strange quark]]''), c (''[[charm quark]]''), b (''[[bottom quark]]''), Q (''[[charge (physics)|charge]]''), B (''[[baryon number]]''), S (''[[strangeness]]''), C (''[[charm (quantum number)|charm]]''), and B′ (''[[bottomness]]''), as well as a wide array of subatomic particles (hover for name).

==Summary table==
Because this table was initially derived from published results and many of those results were preliminary, as many as 64 of the mesons in the following table may not exist or have the wrong mass or quantum numbers.

== Meson properties ==
The following lists details for all known and predicted pseudoscalar ([[total angular momentum|J]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Parity (physics)|P]]&lt;/sup&gt; = 0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and vector ([[total angular momentum|J]]&lt;sup&gt;[[Parity (physics)|P]]&lt;/sup&gt;  = 1&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) mesons.

The properties and quark content of the particles are tabulated below; for the corresponding antiparticles, simply change quarks into antiquarks (and vice versa) and flip the sign of Q, B, S, C, and B′. Particles with &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; next to their names have been predicted by the [[standard model]] but not yet observed. Values in {{color|red|red}} have not been firmly established by experiments, but are predicted by the [[quark model]] and are consistent with the measurements.

===Notes on neutral kaons===
There are two complications with [[Electric charge|neutral]] [[kaon]]s:&lt;ref name="Cronin"/&gt;

*Due to [[Kaon#Neutral kaon mixing|neutral kaon mixing]], the {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|K-short0}} and {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|K-long0}} are not [[eigenstate]]s of [[strangeness]].  However, they ''are'' eigenstates of the [[weak force]], which determines how they [[Radioactive decay|decay]], so these are the particles with definite [[Mean lifetime|lifetime]].
*The [[linear combination]]s given in the table for the {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|K-short0}} and {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|K-long0}} are not exactly correct, since there is a small correction due to [[CP violation]].  See [[Kaon#CP violation|CP violation in kaons]].

Note that these issues also exist in principle for other neutral [[flavour (particle physics)|flavored]] mesons; however, the weak eigenstates are considered separate particles only for kaons because of their dramatically different lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;J.W. Cronin (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

While podcatchers are most known for downloading [[podcast]]s (generally audio files in [[MP3]] format), many are also capable of downloading video, [[newsfeed]]s, text, and pictures. Some podcatchers can also automate the transfer of received audio files to a [[portable media player]]. Although many include a directory of high-profile podcasts, they generally allow users to manually subscribe directly to a feed by providing the [[URL]].

The core concepts [[history of podcasting|had been developing since 2000]], the first commercial podcast client software was developed in 2001,&lt;ref name=Voices2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ciccarelli|first1=Stephanie|title=History of Podcasting|url=https://www.voices.com/resources/articles/podcasting/history-of-podcasting|website=Voices.com|publisher=Interactive Voices, Inc.|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and podcasting became popular in 2004.&lt;ref name="Macnamara2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jim|last=Macnamara|title=The 21st Century Media (r)evolution: Emergent Communication Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOal8bRULroC&amp;pg=PA50|year=2010|publisher=Lang, Peter|isbn=978-1-4331-0936-2|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] added podcatching to its [[iTunes]] software in June 2005, it almost immediately became the most popular client.&lt;ref name="Braun2007"&gt;{{cite book|first=Linda W.|last=Braun|title=Listen Up!: Podcasting for Schools and Libraries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7QaEuV52VEC&amp;pg=PA6|date=January 2007|publisher=Information Today, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57387-304-8|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lorenzo Selva''' (1716 – c. 1790) was an Italian scientific instrument maker.

A [[Venice|Venetian]] [[optician]], Lorenzo Selva worked for 33 years with his father [[Domenico Selva]] (?&amp;ndash;1758) and continued the business after the latter's death. He made several optical instruments. Remarkably, he signed them with his father's name: "To show my ever-greater awareness and gratitude, every work of mine, every improvement and invention, will always be stamped, not with my name but with his beloved one." He described his father's work and the instruments produced in his optical laboratory in ''Esposizione delle comuni, e nuove spezie di Cannocchiali, Telescopj, Microscopj, ed altri Istrumenti Diottrici, Catottrici, e Catodiottrici Perfezionati ed inventati da Domenico Selva ottico'' [...] (Venice, 1761). Lorenzo is also the author of ''Sei dialoghi ottico teorico-pratici'' [Six theoretical-practical optical dialogues] (Venice, 1787). Some of his instruments are shown in the [[Museo Galileo]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/biography/LorenzoSelva.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mucigel''' is a slimy substance that covers the [[root cap]] of the [[root]]s of [[plants]]. It is a highly hydrated [[polysaccharide]], most likely a [[pectin]], which is secreted from the outermost (epidermal) [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of the rootcap. Mucigel is formed in the [[Golgi bodies]] of such cells, and is secreted through the process of [[exocytosis]]. The layer of [[microorganism]]-rich soil surrounding the mucigel is called the [[Rhizosphere (ecology)|rhizosphere]].

Mucigel serves several functions, including&lt;!--but probably not limited to--&gt;:
* Protection of rootcap; prevents [[desiccation]]
* Lubrication of rootcap; allows root to more efficiently penetrate the soil
* Creation of [[symbiotic]] environment for [[nitrogen fixing]] [[bacteria]] (i.e. [[diazotrophs]]) and [[fungi]] (which help with water absorption)
* Provision of a 'diffusion bridge' between the fine root system and soil particles, which allows for a more efficient uptake of water and mineral nutrients by roots in dry soils.

'''New Science Projects''' is a [[blues punk]] band from [[Denton, Texas]]. They play a grungy, [[lo-fi]] styled [[punk rock]], and are known for their wildly eclectic, often bizarre make-up and on-stage mannerisms. They have been described as an "anti-house-disco-hipster band,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = | first =   | title = DC9 in SPACE: New Science Projects | publisher = DC9 at Night | date = June 10, 2009 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufH6Nu9NZg}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Dallas Observer]] in an interview after the band's release of ''Poison Culture''; however, Jones refutes this, claiming he doesn't "want to position [himself] to run for political office at this time."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = | first =   | title = DC9 in SPACE: New Science Projects | publisher = DC9 at Night | date = June 10, 2009 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufH6Nu9NZg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band is significant member of both the local [[Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex]] music scene as well as the local punk scene. New Science Projects has toured throughout North Texas, including [[Mount Righteous]], [[Innards (band)|Innards]], and [[The Two Knights]]; they frequently play at [[1919 Hemphill]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where they are also set to release their album [[Bikini Salute]] in January,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = | first =   | title = Calendar | publisher = 1919 Hemphill | date = January 23, 2011 | url =http://1919hemphill.org/calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been cited as "...A wild ride... like a Bob Dylan nightmare."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hogan | first = Josh | title = Album review: Bikini Salute by New Science Projects | publisher = Pegasus News | date = January 24, 2011 | url =http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2011/jan/24/album-review-bikini-salute-new-science-projects/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were nominated for Best Blues Act in the Dallas Observer's 2010 award series.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = McAnelly | first = Travis | title = Meet the New Science Projects | publisher = My Denton Music | date = November 11, 2010 | url =http://www.mydentonmusic.com/interviews.php?page=nsp-11.11.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Science Projects is known for their bizarre make-up, which depicts all of the band members as severely injured and bleeding. The reasoning behind this has never been answered with clarity. Dale Jones speaks on behalf of the rest of the band, and is notorious for his on-stage persona, including his thick, ambiguous, Eastern European accent, though Jones states that his stage persona is no specific character with any particular origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sullivan | first = Dick | title = Why Dallas Needs New Science Projects, The Mad Man Troubadour | publisher = Front Row: D Magazine | date = July 21, 2010 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufH6Nu9NZg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' mannerisms seem distant and apart from the present; while he is very charismatic, much of his banter is juxtaposed, with multiple conflicting topics being spoken about at any given time, while other speeches very frequently trail off before their conclusion. When asked about his persona, Jones merely replied, "I feel like it is me. So I don't know how I'd be anything else... Unless I was pretending. Which is not a bad idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = | first =   | title = DC9 in SPACE: New Science Projects | publisher = DC9 at Night | date = June 10, 2009 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SufH6Nu9NZg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2003">'''Pension regulation''' is a [[legal term]] encompassing the set of laws, rules and authoritative standards governing the [[pension]] industry, and the procedures needed to enforce them. 

Pension regulation varies widely from one [[jurisdiction]] to another - notably due to the persistence of discrepancies in the degree of [[autonomy]] and breadth of authority and [[discretionary power]] that national and regional pension regulators have at their disposal to enforce efficiently existing laws and regulations, in relation with local judicial practices and varying [[Jurisprudence|jurisprudential]] trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{Citation |url= http://www.blakes.com/english/view_disc.asp?ID=268|accessdate=2005-09-01 |title= Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon Business Bulletin, 'Pension Regulation and Court Trends in British Columbia'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pension regulation seeks to provide the various norms and standards needed to foster market efficiency, consistency, transparency and accountability across the pension industry: it is a key driver of pension funds’s risk management.

In Europe, in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, some pension experts such as Anton van Nunen have argued that excessive or misplaced regulatory activism can sometimes have negative [[unintended consequences]],&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{Citation |url=http://www.globalpensions.com/global-pensions/news/1932709/van-nunen-dutch-regulations-killing-pensions |accessdate=2011-03-20 |title=see Rachel Pichardo-Allison, "Van Nunen: Dutch regulations "killing" pensions",  15 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably when it comes to the strict enforcement of asset liability matching in times high market volatility and the systematic use of bonds-based risk metrics across all asset classes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1501">'''Peter Mackenzie Millman''' (August 10, 1906 &amp;ndash; December 11, 1990) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[astronomer]]. He worked at the [[Dunlap Observatory]] from 1933 until 1940. In early 1941 he enlisted with the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. In 1946 he joined the [[Dominion Observatory]] in [[Ottawa]]. He then transferred to the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in 1955.

During his graduate studies at [[Harvard University]] he started a systematic study of [[meteor]] [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] at the suggestion of [[Harlow Shapley]] in 1929. He continued the work on meteors throughout his active scientific life. He organized one of his most successful observational campaigns in 1946, when on the night of October 9/10 a spectacular shower of the [[Draconids|Giacobinids (October Draconids)]] provided many important photographic spectra.

He was awarded the [[J. Lawrence Smith Medal]] in 1954.

A [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mars]] and the [[minor planet]] [[2904 Millman]] were named in his honor.

'''Rairakhol State''' ({{lang-or|ରେଢ଼ାଖୋଲ ରାଜ୍ୟ}}) was a [[princely state]] during the [[British Raj]] in what is today India. It was one of the [[Chota Nagpur States]] and had its capital at [[Rairakhol]] (Redhakhol), located in the present-day [[Sambalpur district]] of [[Odisha]]. It had an area of {{convert|2157|km2|sqmi}} and a population of 26,888 in 1901.

Most of the state was covered by forest where wild [[elephant]]s used to roam. Rairakhol State's inhabitants spoke mostly the [[Odia language]], although there were also large [[Kol people]] groups speaking [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Oraon language]]. The [[Chasa caste]] was the predominant caste in the state.&lt;ref name="IGI"/&gt;

==History==
Rairakhol was a feudatory state to [[Bamra]] until the 18th century, when the [[Patna (princely state)|Garhjat Rajas of Patna]] freed it from its dependence. According to local tradition the wars between Bamra and Rairakhol used to be constant and during one of these wars the whole of the Rairakhol ruling family was destroyed except for one boy who was hidden by a woman of the Butka Sudh caste —a local caste of agricultural workers. When the soldiers of the King of Bamra Raja came they could not find him and the child was saved. After he became an adult he won back his kingdom and in gratitude the Butka Sudhs are considered by the Rairakhol ruling house as relatives on the mother's side.&lt;ref name="IGI"&gt;They are kadam Vanshies[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_067.gif ''Imperial Gazetteer of India,'' v. 21, p. 61.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The rulers of Rairakhol were Rathore [[Rajput]]s, related to the dynasties ruling in the states of [[Seraikela State|Seraikela]], [[Kharsawan State|Kharsawan]] and [[Bonai State|Bonai]].

During the 19th century Raja Bishan Chandra Janamuni's reign lasted 75 years. The state was under the political control of the Commissioner of the [[Chhattisgarh Division]] of the [[Central Provinces]] until 1905, coming then under the [[Bengal Presidency]]. On 1 January 1948 Rairakhol's last ruler, Raja Girish Chandra Deo, signed the [[instrument of accession]] to the Indian Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/r/rairakhol.html Rairakhol Princely State]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regional planning'''  deals with the efficient placement of [[land-use]] activities, [[infrastructure]], and [[Human settlement|settlement]] growth across a larger area of land than an individual [[city]] or [[town]].  Regional planning is a sub-field of [[urban planning]] as it relates land use practices on a broader scale. It also includes formulating laws that will guide the efficient planning and management of such said regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Smart Legislative Guidebook: Chapter 6 Regional Planning|url=https://www.planning.org/growingsmart/guidebook/six01.htm|website=American Planning Association|publisher=American Planning Association Press|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Although the term "regional planning" is nearly universal in [[English-speaking countries]] the areas covered and specific administrative set ups vary widely. In [[North America]], regional planning may encompass more than one state, such as the [[Regional Plan Association]], or a larger [[conurbation]] or network of settlements. North American regional planning is likely to cover a much larger area than the [[Regional Assemblies of England|Regional Assemblies]] of the [[UK]]; both, however, are equally "regional" in nature.

==Overview==
Regions require various [[land use]]s; protection of [[farmland preservation|farmland]], cities, [[industrial space]], [[transportation hub]]s and infrastructure, [[military base]]s, and [[wilderness]].  Regional planning is the science of efficient placement of infrastructure and zoning for the sustainable growth of a region. Advocates for regional planning such as new urbanist [[Peter Calthorpe]], promote the approach because it can address region-wide environmental, social, and economic issues which may necessarily require a regional focus.

A ‘region’ in planning terms can be administrative or at least partially functional, and is likely to include a network of settlements and character areas. In most European countries, regional and national plans are ‘spatial’ directing certain levels of [[land development|development]] to specific cities and towns in order to support and manage the region depending on specific needs, for example supporting or resisting [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]].

==Principles==
Specific interventions and solutions will depend entirely on the needs of each region in each country, but generally speaking, regional planning at the macro level will seek to:
*Resist development in [[flood plain]]s or along [[earthquake fault]]s. These areas may be utilised as parks, or unimproved farmland.
*Designate transportation corridors using [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hubs and spokes]] and considering major new infrastructure
*Some thought into the various ‘role’s settlements in the region may play, for example some may be administrative, with others based upon manufacturing or transport.
*Consider designating essential nuisance land uses locations, including waste disposal.
*Designate [[Green belt]] land or similar to resist settlement amalgamation and protect the environment.
*Set regional level ‘policy’ and zoning which encourages a mix of housing values and communities.
*Consider building codes, [[zoning]] laws and policies that encourage the best use of the land.

He maintained that many natural problems are characterized by computational intractability or a lack of information, both of which preclude the use of mathematical optimization procedures. He observed in his [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] speech that "decision makers can satisfice either by finding optimum solutions for a simplified world, or by finding satisfactory solutions for a more realistic world. Neither approach, in general, dominates the other, and both have continued to co-exist in the world of [[management]] science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1808698|title = Rational decision making in business organizations|last = Simon|first = Herbert A.|journal = The American Economic Review|doi = |issue = 4|volume = 69|year = 1979|pages = 493–513  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon formulated the concept within a novel approach to rationality, which posits that [[rational choice theory]] is an unrealistic description of human decision processes and calls for psychological realism. He referred to this approach as [[bounded rationality]]. Some [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] theories in [[moral philosophy]] use the concept of satisficing in the same sense, though most call for optimization instead.

== In decision-making research ==
In decision making, satisficing refers to the use of aspiration levels when choosing from different paths of action. By this account, decision-makers select the first option that meets a given need or select the option that seems to address most needs rather than the "optimal" solution.

:Example: A task is to sew a patch onto a pair of jeans. The best needle to do the threading is a 4 inch long needle with a 3 millimeter eye. This needle is hidden in a haystack along with 1,000 other needles varying in size from 1 inch to 6 inches. Satisficing claims that the first needle that can sew on the patch is the one that should be used. Spending time searching for that one specific needle in the haystack is a waste of energy and resources.

A crucial determinant of a satisficing decision strategy concerns the construction of the aspiration level. In many circumstances, the individual may be uncertain about the aspiration level.

:Example: An individual who only seeks a satisfactory retirement income may not know what level of wealth is required—given uncertainty about future prices—to ensure a satisfactory income. In this case, the individual can only evaluate outcomes on the basis of their probability of being satisfactory. If the individual chooses that outcome which has the maximum chance of being satisfactory, then this individual's behavior is theoretically indistinguishable from that of an optimizing individual under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Castagnoli |first=E. |first2=M. |last2=LiCalzi |year=1996 |title=Expected Utility without Utility |journal=Theory and Decision |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=281–301 |doi=10.1007/BF00136129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bordley |first=R. |first2=M. |last2=LiCalzi |year=2000 |title=Decision Analysis Using Targets Instead of Utility Functions |journal=Decisions in Economics &amp; Finance |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=53–74 |doi=10.1007/s102030050005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bordley |first=R. |first2=C. |last2=Kirkwood |year=2004 |title=Preference Analysis with Multiattribute Performance Targets |journal=Operations Research |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=823–835 |doi=10.1287/opre.1030.0093 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key issue concerns an evaluation of satisficing strategies. Although often regarded as an inferior decision strategy, specific satisficing [[Heuristics|strategies]] for inference have been shown to be [[Ecological rationality|ecologically rational]], that is in particular decision environments, they can outperform alternative decision strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reasoning the fast and frugal way: Models of bounded rationality.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.4.650|journal = Psychological Review|pages = 650–669|volume = 103|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.103.4.650|first = Gerd|last = Gigerenzer|first2 = Daniel G.|last2 = Goldstein|pmid=8888650|date=October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satisficing also occurs in consensus building when the group looks towards a solution everyone can agree on even if it may not be the best.
:Example: A group spends hours projecting the next fiscal year's budget. After hours of debating they eventually reach a consensus, only to have one person speak up and ask if the projections are correct. When the group becomes upset at the question, it is not because this person is wrong to ask, but rather because the group has already come up with a solution that works. The projection may not be what will actually come, but the majority agrees on one number and thus the projection is good enough to close the book on the budget.

=== Optimization ===
One popular method for rationalizing satisficing is [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] when ''all'' costs, including the cost of the optimization calculations themselves and the cost of getting information for use in those calculations, are considered. As a result, the eventual choice is usually sub-optimal in regard to the main goal of the optimization, i.e., different from the optimum in the case that the costs of choosing are not taken into account.

==== As a form of optimization ====
Alternatively, satisficing can be considered to be just [[constraint satisfaction]], the process of finding a solution satisfying a set of constraints, without concern for finding an optimum. Any such satisficing problem can be formulated as an (equivalent) optimization problem using the [[Indicator function]] of the satisficing requirements as an [[objective function]]. More formally, if {{math|&lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;}} denotes the set of all options and {{math| &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; &amp;sube; &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;}} denotes the set of "satisficing" options, then selecting a satisficing solution (an element of {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}}) is equivalent to the following optimization problem

: &lt;math&gt;\max_{s\in X} I_{S}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes the [[Indicator function]] of {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}}, that is

:&lt;math&gt;I_{S}(s):=\begin{cases} \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp;,&amp; s\in S\\
0 &amp;,&amp; s\notin S
\end{array}
\end{cases} \ , \ s\in X&lt;/math&gt;

A solution {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt; &amp;isin; &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;}} to this optimization problem is optimal if, and only if, it is a satisficing option (an element of {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}}). Thus, from a decision theory point of view, the distinction between "optimizing" and "satisficing" is essentially a stylistic issue (that can nevertheless be very important in certain applications) rather than a substantive issue. What is important to determine is {{em|what}} should be optimized and {{em|what}} should be satisficed. The following quote from Jan Odhnoff's 1965 paper is appropriate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Odhnoff |first=Jan |year=1965 |title=On the Techniques of Optimizing and Satisficing |journal=The Swedish Journal of Economics |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=24–39 |jstor=3439096  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In my opinion there is room for both 'optimizing' and 'satisficing' models in business economics. Unfortunately, the difference between 'optimizing' and 'satisficing' is often referred to as a difference in the quality of a certain choice. It is a triviality that an optimal result in an optimization can be an unsatisfactory result in a satisficing model. The best things would therefore be to avoid a general use of these two words.}}

==== Applied to the utility framework ====
In [[economics]], satisficing is a [[behavior]] which attempts to achieve at least some [[minimum]] level of a particular [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], but which does not necessarily maximize its value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://huwdixon.org/SurfingEconomics/chapter7.pdf |chapter=Artificial Intelligence and Economic Theory |title=Surfing Economics: Essays for the Inquiring Economist |authorlink=Huw Dixon |first=Huw |last=Dixon |year=2001 |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave |isbn=0-333-76061-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common application of the concept in economics is in the behavioral [[theory of the firm]], which, unlike traditional accounts, postulates that producers treat [[Profit (economics)|profit]] not as a goal to be maximized, but as a constraint. Under these theories, a critical level of profit must be achieved by firms; thereafter, priority is attached to the attainment of other goals.

More formally, as before if {{math|&lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;}} denotes the set of all options {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}, and we have the payoff function '''{{math|&lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;)}}''' which gives the payoff enjoyed by the agent for each option. Suppose we define the optimum payoff {{math|&lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} the solution to

:&lt;math&gt;\max_{s\in X} U(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with the optimum actions being the set '''{{math|&lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;}}''' of options such that {{math|&lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} ''U''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} (i.e. it is the set of all options that yield the maximum payoff). Assume that the set '''{{math|&lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;}}''' has at least one element.

The idea of the {{em|aspiration level}} was introduced by [[Herbert A. Simon]] and developed in economics by Richard Cyert and James March in their 1963 book ''[[Behavioral theory of the firm|A Behavioral Theory of the Firm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cyert |first=Richard |last2=March |first2=James G. |year=1992 |title=A Behavioral Theory of the Firm |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=0-631-17451-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aspiration level is the payoff that the agent aspires to: if the agent achieves at least this level it is satisfied, and if it does not achieve it, the agent is not satisfied. Let us define the aspiration level '''{{math|''A''}}''' and assume that {{math|''A'' ≤ ''U''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Clearly, whilst it is possible that someone can aspire to something that is better than the optimum, it is in a sense irrational to do so. So, we require the aspiration level to be at or below the optimum payoff.

We can then define the set of satisficing options '''{{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}}''' as all those options that yield at least '''{{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;}}''': {{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt; &amp;isin; &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}} {{em|if and only if}} {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; ≤ &lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;)}}. Clearly since {{math|&lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; ≤ &lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it follows that {{math|&lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; &amp;sube; S}}. That is, the set of optimum actions is a subset of the set of satisficing options. So, when an agent satisfices, then she will choose from a larger set of actions than the agent who optimizes. One way of looking at this is that the satisficing agent is not putting in the effort to get to the precise optimum or is unable to exclude actions that are below the optimum but still above aspiration.

An equivalent way of looking at satisficing is {{em|epsilon-optimization}} (that means you choose your actions so that the payoff is within epsilon of the optimum). If we define the "gap" between the optimum and the aspiration as '''{{math|&amp;epsilon;}}''' where {{math|&amp;epsilon; {{=}} ''U''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; − ''A''}}. Then the set of satisficing options '''{{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;(&amp;epsilon;)}}''' can be defined as all those options '''{{math|&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;}}''' such that {{math|&lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt;) ≥ &lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; − &amp;epsilon;}}.

==== Other applications in economics ====
Apart from the behavioral theory of the firm, applications of the idea of satisficing behavior in economics include the Akerlof and Yellen model of [[menu cost]], popular in [[New Keynesian macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akerlof |first=George A. |last2=Yellen |first2=Janet L. |year=1985 |title=Can Small Deviations from Rationality Make Significant Differences to Economic Equilibria? |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=708–720 |jstor=1821349  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akerlof |first=George A. |last2=Yellen |first2=Janet L. |year=1985 |title=A Near-rational Model of the Business Cycle, with Wage and Price Intertia |journal=[[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=823–838 |doi=10.1093/qje/100.Supplement.823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in economics and [[game theory]] there is the notion of an [[Epsilon equilibrium]], which is a generalization of the standard [[Nash equilibrium]] in which each player is within '''{{math|&amp;epsilon;}}''' of his or her optimal payoff (the standard Nash-equilibrium being the special case where '''{{math|&amp;epsilon; {{=}} 0}}''').).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=H.|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/restud/v54y1987i1p47-62.html|title=Approximate Bertrand Equilibria in a replicated Industry|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|volume=54|year=1987|pages=47–62|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endogenous aspiration levels ===
What determines the aspiration level? This can come from past experience (some function of an agent's or firm's previous payoffs), or some organizational or market institutions. For example, if we think of managerial firms, the managers will be expected to earn [[normal profits]] by their shareholders. Other institutions may have specific targets imposed externally (for example state-funded universities in the UK have targets for student recruitment).

An economic example is the [[Huw Dixon|Dixon]] model of an economy consisting of many firms operating in different industries, where each industry is a [[oligopoly|duopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dixon |first=H. |year=2000 |title=Keeping Up with the Joneses: Competition and the Evolution of Collusion |journal=[[Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization]] |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=223–238 |doi=10.1016/S0167-2681(00)00117-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The endogenous aspiration level is the average profit in the economy. This represents the power of the financial markets: in the long-run firms need to earn normal profits or they die (as [[Armen Alchian]] once said, "This is the criterion by which the economic system selects survivors: those who realize positive profits are the survivors; those who suffer losses disappear"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alchian |first=A. |year=1950 |title=Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=211–222 |jstor=1827159 |doi=10.1086/256940  }}&lt;/ref&gt;). We can then think what happens over time. If firms are earning profits at or above their aspiration level, then they just stay doing what they are doing (unlike the optimizing firm which would always strive to earn the highest profits possible). However, if the firms are earning below aspiration, then they try something else, until they get into a situation where they attain their aspiration level. It can be shown that in this economy, satisficing leads to [[collusion]] amongst firms: competition between firms leads to lower profits for one or both of the firms in a duopoly. This means that competition is unstable: one or both of the firms will fail to achieve their aspirations and hence try something else. The only situation which is stable is one where all firms achieve their aspirations, which can only happen when all firms earn average profits. In general, this will only happen if all firms earn the joint-profit maximizing or collusive profit.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon (2000), Theorem 1 page 228. for a non-technical explanation see [http://www.huwdixon.org/SurfingEconomics/chapter8.pdf Chapter 8], [http://www.huwdixon.org/SurfingEconomics/index.html Surfing Economics] by Dixon H&lt;/ref&gt;

== In personality and happiness research ==
{{Main|Maximization (psychology)}}
Some research has suggested that satisficing/[[maximizing]] and other decision-making strategies, like [[personality]] traits, have a strong genetic component and endure over time. This genetic influence on decision-making behaviors has been found through classical [[twin studies]], in which decision-making tendencies are self-reported by pairs of twins and then compared between monozygotic and dizygotic twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simonson |first=I. |last2=Sela |first2=A. |year=2011 |title=On the heritability of consumer decision making: An exploratory approach for studying genetic effects on judgment and choice |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=951–966 |doi=10.1086/657022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that people can be categorized into "maximizers" and "satisficers", with some people landing in between.

The distinction between satisficing and maximizing not only differs in the decision-making process, but also in the post-decision evaluation. [[Maximizing|Maximizer]]s tend to use a more exhaustive approach to their decision-making process: they seek and evaluate more options than satisficers do to achieve greater satisfaction. However, whereas satisficers tend to be relatively pleased with their decisions, maximizers tend to be less happy with their decision outcomes. This is thought to be due to limited cognitive resources people have when their [[Overchoice|options are vast]], forcing maximizers to not make an optimal choice. Because maximization is unrealistic and usually impossible in everyday life, maximizers often feel regretful in their post-choice evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=B. |last2=Ward |first2=A. |last3=Monterosso |first3=J. |last4=Lyubomirsky |first4=S. |last5=White |first5=K. |last6=Lehman |first6=D.

== In survey methodology ==
As an example of satisficing, in the field of [[social cognition]], [[Jon Krosnick]] proposed a theory of [[statistical survey]] satisficing which says that optimal question answering by a survey respondent involves a great deal of [[cognitive]] work and that some people would use satisficing to reduce that burden&lt;ref name="Krosnick1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krosnick|first1=Jon A.|title=Response strategies for coping with the cognitive demands of attitude measures in surveys|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=5|issue=3|year=1991|pages=213–236|issn=08884080|doi=10.1002/acp.2350050305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krosnick1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krosnick|first1=Jon A.|title=Survey research|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=50|issue=1|year=1999|pages=537–567|issn=0066-4308|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Some people may shortcut their cognitive processes in two ways:
* Weak satisficing: Respondent executes all cognitive steps involved in optimizing, but less completely and with [[bias]].
* Strong satisficing: Respondent offers responses that will seem reasonable to the interviewer without any memory search or information integration.

Likelihood to satisfice is linked to respondent ability, respondent [[motivation]] and task difficulty.

Regarding survey answers, satisficing manifests in:
* choosing explicitly offered no-opinion or 'don't know' response option
* choosing socially desirable responses
* non-differentiation or straight-lining when a battery of questions asks for ratings of multiple objects on the same response scale
* acquiescence response bias, which is the tendency to agree with any assertion, regardless of its content
* selecting the first reasonable looking option
* randomly selecting a response
* skipping items
* abandoning the survey or terminating the survey early
* rushing on online surveys
* choosing minimally acceptable answers when verbal answers are required

== Effort satisficing theory ==
The Effort Satisficing Theory (EST) is a recently posited theory (from a 2015 University of Calgary dissertation) whose core purpose is for understanding, predicting and acceptably influencing effort-satisficing behavior and its impact on phenomena such as operational outcomes, organizational performance and economic performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Asamoah-Barnieh, Raymond. 2015. Understanding Variation in Processes and Outcomes of Operational Implementations: A Case Study from Healthcare. University of Calgary PhD Thesis. Online: http://hdl.handle.net/11023/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In EST, satisficing refers to a {{em|volitional entity}} (for instance an employee or economic agent) not exerting the optimal {{em|internal effort}}, the effort required for the best outcomes in all effort requiring activities. Rather than applying the concept of satisficing to the outcome variable (e.g. decision quality), the concept of satisficing is applied to the input variable (the effort) required to generate the outcome variable (e.g. decision quality). In EST the tendency for satisficing is explained with reference to phenomena such as volition and EST self-preservation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fundamental proposition of the effort satisficing theory is that "Volitional entities tend to satisfice on efforts". EST postulates that: people generally exhibit volition (choice) and are as such volitional entities (i.e. people exhibit freedom of choice), volitional entities tend to exhibit a self-preservation imperative (i.e. they try to ensure their well-being is not significantly degraded), the exertion of effort results in the incurrence of {{em|strain}} (which is the outcome of effort exertion for instance, tiredness or financial strain) and volitional entities believe that large amounts of strain signal a threat to their self-preservation imperative. Consequently, when the level of strain incurred by the volitional entity exceeds a threshold called the {{em|satisficing threshold}}, volitional entities tend to exhibit satisficing behaviour by satisficing on their effort exertion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Satisficing in EST is thus the result of an interplay of internal effort (the total effort being exerted by the volitional entity), strain and the satisficing threshold given the prior condition that the axioms defining the theory's universe (namely volition and self-preservation) are satisfied. In EST, factors called the {{em|strain rate determinants}} influence the relationship governing the amount of strain incurred per unit effort. Other factors called the {{em|satisficing threshold determinants}} influence the value of the satisficing threshold, the level of strain at which satisficing tendency becomes very strong.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the effort satisficing theory, there are three modes of influencing satisficing behaviour:
* '''Cutting back on internal effort''' – In this mode, the effort exertion of the volitional entity is reduced so that less strain is incurred. This is done for instance through simplifying tasks, reassignment of work responsibilities and deprioritizing some tasks in organizational management, or by fiscal stimulus and task simplification in macroeconomic management and developmental economics to reduce the effort economic agents (such as businesses) exert in economic activities (such as trade, tax filing, production, business monitoring, employment creation).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Harnessing the strain rate determinants''' – In this mode, the relationship governing the amount of strain incurred per unit effort is altered so that less strain is incurred. This is done for instance through endurance programs and providing productive work environments in organizational management, or by reduced interest rates in macroeconomic management to reduce the economic strain incurred as economic agents pursue economic activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Harnessing the satisficing threshold determinants''' – In this mode, the satisficing threshold is increased so that more strain will need to be incurred before the volitional entity (for example, a person, company or nation) satisfices. This is done for instance through inspiring people to hope and fostering a strong belief in long term outcomes in organizational management, or by raising confidence in the economy (Keynesian animal spirits) in macroeconomic management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
From the EST lens, Keynesian and Hayekian macroeconomic management approaches are not exclusive and contradictory but rather complementary incomplete parts of the much larger EST macroeconomic management approach. For instance, Keynesian macroeconomics attributes economic failure to "animal spirits", a satisficing threshold determinant argument whereas Hayekian macroeconomics attributes economic failure to unsustainable interest rates, a strain rate determinant argument. From the EST lens, both can cause economic failure so both Keynes and Hayek are right. From the EST lens, economies will develop faster if we focus on establishing sustainable systems needed to reduce the economic effort exertion of economic agents in their pursuit of economic activities. These include payment systems which reduce the cost of monitoring, systems which reduce grassroots corruption, impactful and sustainable physical infrastructure as well as social enterprises which facilitate the public good. The challenge for 21st-century governments is therefore not necessarily the use or avoidance of stimulus but rather, the establishment of sustainable systems which permanently reduce the economic effort exertion of economic agents in their pursuit of economic activity to make the world a better place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The propositions of the Effort Satisficing Theory have been used by countries such as Nigeria to actually raise an extra $600 million in annual tax revenue without increasing tax rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Development Finance Forum|title=MOOC on Financing for Development - Domestic Resource Mobilization|date=2016-06-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlFJoeVWu70|accessdate=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered''''' is a collection of essays by German born British economist [[E. F. Schumacher]]. The phrase "Small Is Beautiful" came from a phrase by his teacher [[Leopold Kohr]].&lt;ref name=NYT-Kohr&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EFDE143AF93BA15751C0A962958260 Dr. Leopold Kohr, 84; Backed Smaller States], [[New York Times]] obituary, 28 February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often used to champion small, [[appropriate technologies]] that are believed to empower people more, in contrast with phrases such as "bigger is better".

First published in 1973, ''Small Is Beautiful'' brought Schumacher's critiques of Western economics to a wider audience during the [[1973 energy crisis]] and emergence of [[globalization]]. ''The Times Literary Supplement'' ranked ''Small Is Beautiful'' among the 100 most influential books published since [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=TLS100&gt;[[The Times Literary Supplement]], October 6, 1995, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; A further edition with commentaries was published in 1999.&lt;ref name=Commentaries&gt;Schumacher, E. F.; ''Small Is Beautiful: Economics As If People Mattered : 25 Years Later...With Commentaries'' (1999). [[Hartley &amp; Marks Publishers]] {{ISBN|0-88179-169-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is divided into four parts: "The Modern World", "Resources", "The Third World", and "Organization and Ownership".
 	
Part I summarizes the Economic world of the early 1970s, from Schumacher's perspective. In the first chapter, "The Problem of Production", Schumacher argues that the modern [[economy]] is unsustainable. [[Natural resources]] (like [[fossil fuel]]s), are treated as expendable [[income]], when in fact they should be treated as [[capital (economics)|capital]], since they are not renewable, and thus subject to eventual depletion. He further argues that nature's resistance to [[pollution]] is limited as well. He concludes that government effort must be concentrated on [[sustainable development]], because relatively minor improvements, for example, [[technology transfer]] to [[Third World]] countries, will not solve the underlying problem of an unsustainable economy. Schumacher's philosophy is one of "enoughness", appreciating both human needs and limitations, and [[appropriate technology|appropriate use of technology]]. It grew out of his study of village-based economics, which he later termed [[Buddhist economics]], which is the subject of the book's fourth chapter.

Part II casts Education as the greatest resource, and discusses Land, Industry, Nuclear Energy and the human impact of Technology.

Part III discusses the gap between the center of the [[World-systems theory|World System]] and the developing world as it existed then, with a focus on village culture and unemployment in India.

Part IV presents a sketch of a Theory of Large Scale Organization, refutes and exposes some commonplace and false platitudes about Capitalism as a social order and discusses alternatives. Chapter 3 of this part concludes with advice to Socialists (who presumably are at the [[Commanding heights of the economy|Commanding Heights]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Socialists should insist on using the nationalised industries not simply to out-capitalise the capitalists -- an attempt in which they may or may not succeed -- but to evolve a more democratic and dignified system of industrial administration, a more humane employment of machinery, and a more intelligent utilization of the fruits of human ingenuity and effort. If they can do this, they have the future in their hands. If they cannot, they have nothing to offer that is worthy of the sweat of free-born men."&lt;ref&gt;p. 261 1975 Paperback Edition SBN 06-080352-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Sociological Imagination''''' is a 1959 book by American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] published by [[Oxford University Press]].  In it, he develops the idea of [[sociological imagination]], the means by which the relation between self and society can be understood.

Mills felt that the central task for sociology and sociologists was to find (and articulate) the connections between the particular social environments of individuals (also known as "[[social environment|milieu]]") and the wider social and historical forces in which they are enmeshed. The approach challenges a [[structural functionalist]] approach to sociology, as it opens new positions for the individual to inhabit with regard to the larger social structure. Individual function that reproduces larger social structure is only one of many possible roles and is not necessarily the most important. Mills also wrote of the danger of malaise (apathy),{{clarify|date=September 2013}} which he saw as inextricably embedded in the creation and maintenance of modern societies. This led him to question whether individuals exist in modern societies in the sense that "individual" is commonly understood (Mills, 1959, 7–12).

In writing ''The Sociological Imagination'', Mills tried to reconcile two varying, abstract conceptions of social reality, the "individual" and the "society", and thereby challenged the dominant sociological discourse to define some of its most basic terms and be forthright about the premises behind its definitions. He began the project of reconciliation and challenge with critiques of "grand theory" and "abstracted empiricism", outlining and criticizing their use in the current sociology of the day.

In 1998 the [[International Sociological Association]] listed the work as the second most important sociological book of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="isa-sociology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/ |title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand theory==

In chapter two, Mills seems to be criticizing Parsonian Sociology. In this he directly addresses ''The Social System'', written by [[Talcott Parsons]].

In ''The Social System'', Parsons describes the nature of the structure of society and the creation and maintenance of a culture through the socialization of individuals. Mills criticizes this tendency in sociology on several grounds. He argues for a more heterogeneous form of society in that he challenges the extent to which a single uniformity of society is indeed possible (Mills, 1959, 26-30).

===Social order===

Mills criticizes the Parsonian formulation of social order, particularly the idea that social order can indeed be seen as a whole. He writes that every individual cannot simply be fully integrated into society and internalize all its cultural forms. Furthermore, such domination may be seen as a further extension of power and social stratification.

[[John David Brewer|Brewer]] (2004) sees ''The Sociological Imagination'' as an extension of Mills's other works on power and social stratification, i.e. ''[[The Power Elite]]'' and ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes|White Collar]]''.
According to Mills, what grand theorists call ''value orientation'' could in actuality be a form of domination and thereby may simply be a form of legitimation (Mills, 1959, 33-36).

===Role of social theory===

He further criticizes Parsonian Sociology on its ability to theorize as a form of pure abstraction that society can be understood irrespective of its historical and contextual nature without observation.

He argues that society and its cultural symbols cannot be seen as self-determining and cannot be derived without reference to individuals and their consciousness. All power according to Parsons is based on a system of beliefs enforced by society, writes Mills. In this he criticizes Parsons for his view in terms of historical and social change and diversity (Mills, 1959, 40-46).

He thereby criticizes the means by which a social order can be derived without observation (Mills, 1959, 46-48).

==Abstract empiricism&lt;!--'Abstract empiricism' redirects here--&gt;==

In the third chapter Mills criticizes the empirical methods of social research which he saw as evident at the time in the conception of data and the handling of methodological tools.

This can be seen as a reaction to the plethora of social research being developed from about the time of World War II. This can thereby be seen as much a criticism by Brewer that Mills may have been critical of the research being conducted and sponsored by the American government.

As such Mills criticizes the methodological inhibition which he saw as characteristic of what he called '''abstract empiricism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. In this he can be seen criticizing the work of [[Paul F. Lazarsfeld]] who conceives of sociology not as a discipline but as a methodological tool (Mills, 1959, 55-59).

He argues that the problem of such social research is that there may be a tendency towards "psychologism", which explains human behavior on the individual level without reference to the social context. This, he argues, may lead to the separation of research from theory.
He then writes of the construction of milieu in relation to social research and how both theory and research are related (Mills, 1959, 65-68).

==The human variety==

In chapter seven Mills sets out what is thought to be his vision of Sociology. He writes of the need to integrate the social, biographical, and historical versions of reality in which individuals construct their social milieus with reference to the wider society (Mills, 1959, 132-134).

He argues that the nature of society is continuous with historical reality. In doing so, Mills writes of the importance of the empirical adequacy of theoretical frameworks. He also writes of the notion of a unified social sciences. This he believes is not a conscious effort but is a result of the historical problem-based discourses out of which the disciplines developed, in which the divisions between the disciplines become increasingly fluid (Mills, 1959, 136-140). Thus, Mills sets out what he believed to be a problem-based approach to his conception of social sciences (140-142).

== On reason and freedom ==

=== The call to social scientists in the Fourth Epoch ===
Mills&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=The sociological imagination|date=1959|publisher=Oxford University  Press|year=|isbn=978-0195133738|location=New York|pages=165–176|quote=|via=|last1=Mills|first1=C. Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; opens "On Reason and Freedom" with the two facets of the sociological imagination (history and biography) in relationship to the social scientist. Mills asserts that it is time for social scientists to address the troubles of the individual and the issues of society to better understand the state of freedom specific to this historical moment. According to Mills, understanding personal troubles in relationship to social structure is the task of the social scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=C. Wright Mills: An American utopian|date=1983|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0029150108|location=New York|last1=Horowitz|first1=Irving Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mills goes on to situate the reader in the historically specific moment that he wrote the book, or what Mills refers to as the Fourth Epoch. Mills explains that "nowadays men everywhere seek to know where they stand, where they may be going, and what—if anything—they can do about the present as history and the future as responsibility" (165).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To have a better understanding of the self and society, it is necessary to develop new ways of making sense of reality as old methods for understanding associated with liberalism and socialism are inadequate in this new epoch. Enlightenment promises associated with the previous epoch have failed; increased rationality moves society further away from freedom rather than closer to it.

=== The Cheerful Robot and freedom ===
Mills explains that highly rationalized organizations, such as bureaucracies, have increased in society; however, reason as used by the individual has not because the individual does not have the time or means to exercise reason. Mills differentiates reason and rationality. Reason, or that which is associated with critical and reflexive thought, can move individuals closer to freedom. On the other hand, rationality, which is associated with organization and efficiency, results in a lack of reason and the destruction of freedom. Despite this difference, rationality is often conflated with freedom.

Greater rationality in society, as understood by Mills, results in the rationalization of every facet of life for the individual until there is the loss "of his capacity and will to reason; it also affects his chances and his capacity to act as a free man" (170).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This does not mean that individuals in society are unintelligent or hopeless. Mills is not suggesting determinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="The implications of the sociology of C. Wright Mills for modern criminological theory revisited." In C.

Mills believed in the individual's autonomy and potential to alter societal structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scimecca|first=Joseph A.|year=1976|title=Paying Homage to the Father: C. Wright Mills and radical  sociology.|url=|journal=Sociological Quarterly|volume=17|pages=180–196|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The individual who does not exercise reason and passively accepts their social position is referred to by Mills as "The Cheerful Robot" in which the individual is alienated from the self and society totally. Mills asks if, at some point and time in the future, individuals will accept this state of total rationality and alienation willingly and happily. This is a pressing concern as the Cheerful Robot is the "antithesis" of democratic society; the Cheerful Robot is the "ultimate problem of freedom" (175) as a threat to society's values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Mills, social scientists must study social structure, using the sociological imagination, to understand the state of freedom in this epoch. Mills concludes this section of ''The Sociological Imagination'' with a call to social scientists: it is the promise of the social sciences to analyze the individual's troubles and society's issues in order to not only evaluate freedom in society but to foster it.

==Reaction==

Mills's work was widely read in its time, and ''The Sociological Imagination'' is still one of the most widely read tracts of sociology and a staple of undergraduate sociology courses. His work was not well received at the time, which can be seen as a result of Mills's professional and personal reputation (Brewer, 2004, 317).

This is somewhat appropriate given that the nature of Mills's work patterned around the biography of individuals, their historical actions and the relation to the wider society in terms of structure, in as much as Mills's own life has been seen by others as illustrative of his conception of Sociology. He hoped to reconcile the issues of individuals with the problems facing society, thereby framing individuals' problems in social, political, and historical reality (Brewer, 2004, 320).

Thus, he can be seen as trying to create a three-dimensional view of society and, according to Brewer (2004), attempted to break down the divide between the public and the private realms of society, something characteristic of Sociology at the time. In this, he was viewing society as simultaneously macroscopic and microscopic in nature whilst trying to merge both historical and contemporary social realities (Brewer, 2004, 320-321).

His work was widely criticized due to what were perceived critical attacks on the discipline. This can be seen in his writings where he criticizes both the "methodological inhibition" of what he refers to as '''abstract empiricism''' (i.e. the work of Paul F. Lazarsfield) and what he refers to as the "fetishisation of concepts" in the works of those such as Talcott Parsons. Mills criticized the "grand theory" and the [[positivism]] of [[structural functionalism]] in Parsons' work (Brewer, 2004, 322-324).

===The political nature of Mills's work===

This exacerbated what were seen as professional disagreements which were then ongoing with other professionals in the discipline. In particular his criticism of abstracted empiricism was seen in conjunction to his criticisms of both state sponsored research and the political policies of the Cold War American government (Brewer, 2004, 326-328).

As such, his work was not well received.  Both in Britain and in America he came under criticism. In Britain his work was criticized for the extent to which he was seen to attack empirical Sociology which was then common in Britain at the time. In America, his criticism of ''structural functionalism'' and of its accompanying critiques of power and stratification made him somewhat subject to severe criticism (Brewer, 2004, 328-330).

==The personality of C. Wright Mills==

The reception of C. Wright Mills can now be seen as somewhat illustrative of Mills's personality. In his work, we can see the "space of selfhood" which Mills argued individuals connect individuals with society as a whole. Thus, of personalized experiences being used to link public discourses he can thereby be seen to mark a biographical turn in [[post-structuralist]] Sociology (Brewer, 2005, 661-663).

His work can also be seen as reaction to cold war America and the radicalism and disengagement with establishment sociology. It can also, however, be seen as return by those such as Brewer to a tradition of "social reformism" as well as a response to the professionalization of the discipline (Brewer, 2005, 663-665).

His conception of the specialization of the discipline can be seen in the works of [[Georg Simmel]], in his idea of social space and social configurations of space. Thus, Brewer (2005) seems to see him returning the discipline to the configuration of biography and self in the configuration of social space. This can also be seen in the [[social constructionism]] and the importance of space and time in the work of [[Anthony Giddens]]. This is most reminiscent of "the templates of the self" as seen as the understanding of the self in relation to social space as written by [[Erving Goffman]] and his conception of "frontstage" and "backstage". Thus the work of Mills can be seen as an illustrative example in terms of his biography of the conception of social space and the importance of narrative (Brewer, 2005, 665-667).

His life is therefore seen as having an impact on his construction of self. This can be seen as a reflection therefore of his background and the importance he placed on independence, self-reliance, and individualism in the creation of autonomy and what others would refer to as the "[o]ccupational role of the loner".  This "outsider mentality", as referred to by Brewer (2005), can be seen as form of personal survival whereby Mills could thereby distance himself from personal and professional criticism. Thus, the Sociological Imagination is seen by many as a connection between Mills' life and work (Brewer, 2005, 668-671).

==Legacy of Mills==

The work of C. Wright Mills can be seen as extended in the work of Michael Burawoy and his conception of "[[public sociology]]". In his speech to the American Sociological Association he speaks of the importance of public discourse and the importance of Sociology as an agent of historical change (Burawoy, 2005, 259-261).

This can also be seen in his work ''Ethnography Unbound'', in which he refers to his Extended case method of ethnography and relates C. Wright Mills work in his idea of theory construction as the relation of "the personal troubles of the milieu" to "the public issues of the social structure" (C. Wright Mills, in Burawoy, 1991, 6).

'''Visual analytics''' is an outgrowth of the fields of [[information visualization]] and [[scientific visualization]] that focuses on analytical [[reasoning]] facilitated by interactive [[User interface|visual interface]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pak Chung Wong and J. Thomas (2004). "Visual Analytics". in: ''IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications'', Volume 24, Issue 5, Sept.-Oct. 2004 Page(s): 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Visual analytics is "the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces."&lt;ref name="JJT05"&gt;[[Jim Thomas (visualization)|James J. Thomas]] and Kristin A. Cook (Ed.) (2005). [http://vis.pnnl.gov ''Illuminating the Path: The R&amp;D Agenda for Visual Analytics''] National Visualization and Analytics Center.&lt;/ref&gt; It can attack certain problems whose size, complexity, and need for closely coupled human and machine analysis may make them otherwise intractable.&lt;ref name="RK 07"&gt;Robert Kosara (2007). [http://www.viscenter.uncc.edu/courses/visanalytics.html ''Visual Analytics'']. ITCS 4122/5122, Fall 2007. Retrieved 28 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Visual analytics advances science and technology developments in analytical reasoning, interaction, data transformations and representations for computation and visualization, analytic reporting, and technology transition.&lt;ref&gt;Kielman, J. and Thomas, J. (Guest Eds.) (2009). "Special Issue: Foundations and Frontiers of Visual Analytics". in: ''[[Information Visualization (journal)|Information Visualization]]'', Volume 8, Number 4, Winter 2009 Page(s): 239-314.&lt;/ref&gt; As a research agenda, visual analytics brings together several scientific and technical communities from computer science, information visualization, cognitive and perceptual sciences, interactive design, graphic design, and social sciences.

Visual analytics integrates new computational and theory-based tools with innovative interactive techniques and [[Representation (psychology)|visual representation]]s to enable human-information discourse. The design of the tools and techniques is based on [[cognitive science|cognitive]], [[design]], and [[visual perception|perceptual]] principles. This science of analytical reasoning provides the reasoning framework upon which one can build both strategic and tactical visual analytics technologies for threat analysis, prevention, and response. Analytical reasoning is central to the analyst’s task of applying human judgments to reach conclusions from a combination of evidence and assumptions.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

Visual analytics has some overlapping goals and techniques with [[information visualization]] and [[scientific visualization]]. There is currently no clear consensus on the boundaries between these fields, but broadly speaking the three areas can be distinguished as follows:

* Scientific visualization deals with data that has a natural geometric structure (e.g., MRI data, wind flows).
* Information visualization handles abstract data structures such as trees or graphs.
* Visual analytics is especially concerned with coupling interactive visual representations with underlying analytical processes (e.g., statistical procedures, [[data mining]] techniques) such that high-level, complex activities can be effectively performed (e.g., sense making, reasoning, decision making).

Visual analytics seeks to marry techniques from information visualization with techniques from computational transformation and analysis of data. Information visualization forms part of the direct interface between user and machine, amplifying human cognitive capabilities in six basic ways:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Card, J.D. Mackinlay, and Ben Shneiderman (1999). "Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think". Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

# by increasing cognitive resources, such as by using a visual resource to expand human working memory,
# by reducing search, such as by representing a large amount of data in a small space,
# by enhancing the recognition of patterns, such as when information is organized in space by its time relationships,
# by supporting the easy perceptual inference of relationships that are otherwise more difficult to induce,
# by perceptual monitoring of a large number of potential events, and
# by providing a manipulable medium that, unlike static diagrams, enables the exploration of a space of parameter values

These capabilities of information visualization, combined with computational data analysis, can be applied to analytic reasoning to support the sense-making process.

== Topics ==

=== Scope ===

Visual analytics is a multidisciplinary field that includes the following focus areas:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

* Analytical reasoning techniques that enable users to obtain deep insights that directly support assessment, planning, and decision making
* Data representations and transformations that convert all types of conflicting and dynamic data in ways that support visualization and analysis
* Techniques to support production, presentation, and dissemination of the results of an analysis to communicate information in the appropriate context to a variety of audiences.
* Visual representations and [[interaction technique]]s&lt;ref name="KS12"&gt;A. Kerren and F. Schreiber. Toward the Role of Interaction in Visual Analytics. In Proceedings of the 2012 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC '12), pages 420:1-420:13, Berlin, Germany, 2012. IEEE Computer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once.

=== Analytical reasoning techniques ===

Analytical reasoning techniques are the method by which users obtain deep insights that directly support situation assessment, planning, and decision making. Visual analytics must facilitate high-quality human judgment with a limited investment of the analysts’ time. Visual analytics tools must enable diverse analytical tasks such as:&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

* Understanding past and present situations quickly, as well as the trends and events that have produced current conditions
* Identifying possible alternative futures and their warning signs
* Monitoring current events for emergence of warning signs as well as unexpected events
* Determining indicators of the intent of an action or an individual
* Supporting the decision maker in times of crisis.

These tasks will be conducted through a combination of individual and collaborative analysis, often under extreme time pressure. Visual analytics must enable hypothesis-based and scenario-based analytical techniques, providing support for the analyst to reason based on the available evidence.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

=== Data representations ===

Data representations are structured forms suitable for computer-based transformations. These structures must exist in the original data or be derivable from the data themselves. They must retain the information and knowledge content and the related context within the original data to the greatest degree possible. The structures of underlying data representations are generally neither accessible nor intuitive to the user of the visual analytics tool. They are frequently more complex in nature than the original data and are not necessarily smaller in size than the original data. The structures of the data representations may contain hundreds or thousands of dimensions and be unintelligible to a person, but they must be transformable into lower-dimensional representations for visualization and analysis.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;

=== Theories of visualization ===
Theories of visualization include:&lt;ref name="RK 07" /&gt;
* [[Jacques Bertin]]'s ''[[Semiology of Graphics]]'' (1967)
* [[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''Languages of Art'' (1977)
* [[Jock D. Mackinlay]]'s ''Automated design of optimal visualization'' (APT) (1986)
* [[Leland Wilkinson]]'s ''Grammar of Graphics'' (1998)

=== Visual representations ===

Visual representations translate data into a visible form that highlights important features, including commonalities and anomalies. These visual representations make it easy for users to perceive salient aspects of their data quickly. Augmenting the cognitive reasoning process with perceptual reasoning through visual representations permits the analytical reasoning process to become faster and more focused.&lt;ref name="JJT05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2016/11/23/making-wikipedia-knowledge-visible/|title=Making Wikipedia Knowledge Visible—Wolfram|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==

The input for the data sets used in the visual analytics process are [[heterogeneous]] data sources (i.e., the internet, newspapers, books, scientific experiments, expert systems). From these rich sources, the data sets ''S = S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' are chosen, whereas each ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; , i ∈ (1, ..., m)'' consists of [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] A&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., A&lt;sub&gt;ik&lt;/sub&gt;. The goal or output of the process is insight ''I''. Insight is either directly obtained from the set of created visualizations ''V'' or through confirmation of [[hypotheses]] ''H'' as the results of automated analysis methods. This formalization of the visual analytics process is illustrated in the following figure. Arrows represent the transitions from one set to another one.

More formally the visual analytics process is a [[Data transformation|transformation]] ''F: S → I'', whereas ''F'' is a concatenation of functions ''f ∈ {D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;, U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;}'' defined as follows:

''D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;'' describes the basic data [[pre-processing]] functionality with ''D&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; : S → S and W ∈ {T, C, SL, I}'' including data transformation functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'', data cleaning functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'', data selection functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt;'' and data integration functions ''D&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' that are needed to make analysis functions applicable to the data set.

''V&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, W ∈ {S, H}'' symbolizes the visualization functions, which are either functions visualizing data ''V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → V'' or functions visualizing hypotheses ''V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; : H → V''.

''H&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;, Y ∈ {S, V}'' represents the hypotheses generation process. We distinguish between functions that generate hyphotheses from data ''H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → H'' and functions that generate hypotheses from visualizations ''H&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; : V → H''.

Moreover, user interactions ''U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;, Z ∈ {V, H, CV, CH}'' are an integral part of the visual analytics process. User interactions can either effect only visualizations ''U&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; : V → V'' (i.e., selecting or zooming), or can effect only hypotheses ''U&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; : H → H'' by generating a new hypotheses from given ones. Furthermore, insight can be concluded from visualizations ''U&lt;sub&gt;CV&lt;/sub&gt; : V → I'' or from hypotheses ''U&lt;sub&gt;CH&lt;/sub&gt; : H → I''.

The typical data pre-processing applying data cleaning, data integration and data transformation functions is defined as ''D&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; = D&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;(D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)))''. After the pre-processing step either automated analysis methods ''H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = {f&lt;sub&gt;s1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., f&lt;sub&gt;sq&lt;/sub&gt;}'' (i.e., statistics, data mining, etc.) or visualization methods ''V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; : S → V, V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = {f&lt;sub&gt;v1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., f&lt;sub&gt;vs&lt;/sub&gt;}'' are applied to the data, in order to reveal patterns as shown in the figure above.&lt;ref name="VASC08"&gt;Daniel A. Keim, Florian Mansmann, Jörn Schneidewind, Jim Thomas, and Hartmut Ziegler (2008). "Visual Analytics: Scope and Challenges"&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the following paradigm is used to process the data:

''Analyse First – Show the Important – Zoom, Filter and Analyse Further – Details on Demand''&lt;ref&gt;Keim D. A, Mansmann F, Schneidewind J, Thomas J, Ziegler H: ''Visual analytics: Scope and challenges''. ''Visual Data Mining:'' 2008, S. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Walla Walla River''' is a tributary of the [[Columbia River]], joining the Columbia just above [[Wallula Gap]] in southeastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in the United States. The river flows through [[Umatilla County, Oregon]], and [[Walla Walla County, Washington]].&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt; Its [[drainage basin]] is {{convert|1758|sqmi|km2}} in area.&lt;ref name=nwcouncil&gt;[http://www.nwcouncil.org/fw/subbasinplanning/wallawalla/plan/EntirePlan.pdf Walla Walla Subbasin Plan], Northwest Power and Conservation Council&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course==
The headwaters of the Walla Walla River lie in the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] of northeastern [[Oregon]]. The river originates as the North and South Forks of the Walla Walla River. The surrounding forested land holds a network of hiking and mountain-biking trails.

The confluence of the North and South Forks lies east of [[Milton-Freewater, Oregon|Milton–Freewater]], Oregon. The river flows eastward to reach Milton–Freewater, which is built along its banks, and then flows northward through Milton–Freewater. Irrigation water is drawn from the river here and at numerous locations along the river.

The Walla Walla River flows southwest of the city of [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]] in the Walla Walla valley. [[Mill Creek (Washington)|Mill Creek]], which flows through the city of Walla Walla, joins the Walla Walla River at the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site|Whitman Mission]] west of the city of Walla Walla.

The [[Touchet River]] joins the Walla Walla at the town of [[Touchet, Washington]]. The annual mean [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] of the Walla Walla River just below the Touchet River confluence is {{convert|1212|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum recorded discharge was {{convert|20300|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}} in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/wdr/2005/wdr-wa-05-1/ Water Resources Data, Washington Water year 2005], USGS Water-Data Reports&lt;/ref&gt;

The river enters the Columbia a mile south of the town of [[Wallula, Washington|Wallula]] just north of [[Wallula Gap]]. The section of the Columbia River is called Wallula Lake, the reservoir impoundment created by [[McNary Dam]].

==History==
[[Image:Wind-Turbines-over-Walla-Walla-Rvr.JPG|thumb|240px|Wind turbines over the lower Walla Walla. River depleted by irrigation water withdrawal.]]
The [[Walla Walla (tribe)|Walla Walla tribe]] occupied the region around the Walla Walla river prior to white settlers entry to the region.

The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] (1804&amp;ndash;1806) was the first [[United States]] overland expedition to the Pacific coast and back&amp;mdash;the return expedition stopped at the mouth of the Walla Walla and stayed with the Walla Walla tribe for a portion of the journey, proceeding from there overland to the [[Snake River]]. British explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] was the first European to navigate the entire length of the Columbia River, to the Pacific Ocean, in 1811.

[[Fort Nez Percés]]  (later known as [[Fort Walla Walla]]) was a fortified [[fur trade|fur trading]] post on the [[Columbia River]] on the territory of modern-day Wallula, Washington. It was in operation from 1818 until 1857 on the eastern shore of the Columbia River, immediately north of the mouth of the Walla Walla River. The [[Oregon Treaty]] ended joint U.S.A. - British occupation that had been effect since the [[Treaty of 1818]]. The fort was abandoned in 1857 when the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] gave up its [[Columbia District]] business in the [[Oregon Territory]].

The Whitman Mission was established in 1836. It lies near the banks of the river to the west of the modern city of Walla Walla.

==Fish==
The Walla Walla River supports populations of spring [[Chinook salmon|Chinook]] salmon, summer [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], and [[bull trout]] among other species.  There is a sport fishery for steelhead in the river.
It also holds [[channel catfish]] and [[smallmouth bass]] in the summer.

==Science==

There have been a wide range of studies on the Walla Walla River and the overall catchment area. Work done by both Oregon and Washington State government, federal and state environmental agencies and local watershed councils and groups have produced a wide range of studies.  The WWBWC (www.wwbwc.org) has both electronic and paper copies of many of these reports that date back to the 1930s. A considerable amount of work has gone into the assessment of water quantity and quality for the purpose of salmon recovery and sustainable irrigation supply.  A highly interconnected alluvial groundwater system and  its over abstraction through over allocated irrigation usage has also acted to influence flows and quality in the Walla Walla River.  

The promise of the Walla Walla river lies inside its integrated water management strategy using Managed Aquifer Recharge (Or Shallow Aquifer Recharge) to utilise available non-irrigation season water to replenish groundwater supplies and the over allocation of groundwater resources by both state governments.  The Walla Walla partnership along with the WWBWC are setting a national example with this innovative and low cost alternative to surface storage using dams.
