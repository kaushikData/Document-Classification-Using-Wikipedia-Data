==Biography==
Abdolkarim Soroush was born in [[Tehran]] in 1945. Upon finishing high school, Soroush began studying pharmacy after passing the national entrance exams of Iran. After completing his degree, he soon left Iran for [[London]] in order to continue his studies and to become familiar with the modern world.

It was after receiving a master's degree in [[analytical chemistry]] from [[University of London]] that he went to [[Chelsea College of Art and Design|Chelsea College]], (a constituent college of the [[University of London]] which was merged with two other constituent colleges: Queen Elizabeth College and Kings College in 1985) for studying history and [[philosophy of science]]. During these years, confrontation between the people and the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah's]] regime was gradually becoming more serious, and political gatherings of Iranians in America and Europe, and Britain in particular, were on the increase. Soroush, too, was thus drawn into the field.

After the revolution, Soroush returned to Iran and there he published his book ''Knowledge and Value'' (''Danesh va Arzesh''), the writing of which he had completed in England. He then went to [[Tehran]]'s Teacher Training College where he was appointed the director of the newly established Islamic Culture Group. While in Tehran, Soroush established studies in both history and the philosophy of science.

A year later, all universities were shut down, and a new body was formed by the name of the Cultural Revolution Committee comprising seven members, including Abdulkarim Soroush, all of whom were appointed directly by Ayatollah [[Khomeini]]. Soroush's joining of the Cultural Revolution committee has been criticized on two sides. He has been accused by orthodox critics of preventing the Islamization of human sciences and by the opposition of the Islamic Republic regime of Iran to involvement in the dismissal of teachers.
Soroush rejected the opposition accusation. There is not an independent historical research on Soroush's role in events which led to the Cultural Revolution and also his membership and his role in the Cultural Revolution committee. He has welcomed of such study in his interview with Professor Forough Jahanbakhsh - inquiring into modern Iranian intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Jahanbakhsh, Forough, Islam, Democracy and Religious Modernism in Iran, 1953-2000: From Bazargan to Soroush, Brill, 2001, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, owing to certain differences which emerged between him and the management of the Teacher Training College, he secured a transfer to the Institute for Cultural Research and Studies where he has been serving as a research member of staff until today. He submitted his resignation from membership in the Cultural Revolution Council to Imam Khomeini and has since held no official position within the ruling system of Iran, except occasionally as an advisor to certain government bodies. His principal position has been that of a researcher in the Institute for Cultural Research and Studies.

During the 90s, Soroush gradually became more critical of the political role played by the Iranian clergy. The monthly magazine that he cofounded, ''Kiyan'', soon became the most visible forum in post-revolution Iran for religious intellectualism. In this magazine he published his most controversial articles on religious pluralism, hermeneutics, tolerance, clericalism, etc. The magazine was clamped down in 1998 among with many other magazines and newspapers by the direct order of the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic. About a thousand audio tapes of speeches by Soroush on various social, political, religious and literary subjects delivered all over the world are widely in circulation in Iran and elsewhere. Soon, he not only became subject to harassment and state censorship, but also lost his job and security. His public lectures at universities in Iran are often disrupted by hardline Ansar-e-Hizbullah vigilante groups who see his intellectual endeavours as being mainly motivated by anti-regime politics rather than theology per se.

From the year 2000 Abdulkarim Soroush has been a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]] teaching Rumi poetry and philosophy, Islam and Democracy, Quranic Studies and Philosophy of Islamic Law. Also a scholar in residence in [[Yale University]], he taught Islamic Political Philosophy at [[Princeton University]] in the 2002-3 academic year. From 2003-4 he served as a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin|Wissenschaftkolleg]] in Berlin. He spent the fall semester of 2007 at Columbia University and the spring semester of 2008 at Georgetown University's [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as a visiting scholar. In the winter of 2012, he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]] teaching Intellectual and Religious History of Modern Iran.

== Philosophy==
Soroush is primarily interested in the philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, the philosophical system of Molana Jalaleddin Balkhi ([[Rumi]]) and comparative philosophy. He is a world expert on Rumi and Persian Sufi poetry.

The philosophy of Abdolkarim Soroush can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drsoroush.com/Persian/On_DrSoroush/On_13851013_Paya.html Dr. Soroush&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Distinction between "religion" and our "understanding of religion".
*Distinction between "essential" and "accidental" aspects of religion.
*Distinction between "minimalist" and "maximalist" interpretation of Islam.
*Distinction between values and morals that are considered internal in respect to Islam and those that are external.
*Distinction between Religious "belief" and Religious "faith".
*Distinction between religion as an ideology/identity and religion of truth.

===Distinction between "religion" and our "understanding of religion"===
Soroush's main contribution to Islamic philosophy is that he maintains that one should distinguish between religious as divinely revealed and the interpretation of religion or religious knowledge which is based on socio-historical factors. In Oxford, professors such as [[Komeil Sadeghi]], Iranian philosopher influenced him so much that Soroush dedicated one of his best books named "Expansion of Prophetic Experience " to his honourable master.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Soroush's main thesis, entitled ''The Theoretical Contraction and Expansion of Shari'a'' separates religion per se from religious knowledge. The former, the essence of religion, is perceived as beyond human reach, eternal and divine. The latter, religious knowledge, is a sincere and authentic but finite, limited, and fallible form of human knowledge.[http://www.kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm]

===Religious "belief" and religious "faith"===
Faith cannot be compulsory.  As he told one interviewer, "True believers must embrace their faith of their own free will - not because it was imposed, or inherited, or part of the dominant local culture. To become a believer under pressure or coercion isn't true belief.`"&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; This also means that the believer "must ... remain free to leave his faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drsoroush.com/English/On_DrSoroush/E-CMO-19960400-1.html Islam and Liberal Democracy. Two Visions of Reformation], by Robin Wright, ''Journal of Democracy'', 7.2 (1996) 64-75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soroush's political theory ===

Soroush's political theory is in line with the modern tradition from Locke to the framers of the American constitution. It portrays human beings as weak and susceptible to temptation, even predation. As such, they need a vigilant and transparent form of government. He believes that the assumption of innate goodness of mankind, shared by radical Utopians from anarchists to Islamic fundamentalists underestimates the staying power of social evil and discounts the necessity of a government of checks and balances to compensate for the weaknesses of human nature.[http://www.kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm]

Soroush's political philosophy, as well, remains close to the heart of the liberal tradition, ever championing the basic values of reason, liberty, freedom, and democracy. They are perceived as "primary values," as independent virtues, not handmaidens of political maxims and religious dogma. Soroush entwines these basic values and beliefs in a rich tapestry of Islamic primary sources, literature, and poetry.[http://www.kadivar.com/Htm/English/Reviews/reform.htm]

=== Religious democracy ===
{{confusing section|date=September 2012}}
Soroush introduced his own definition of the term ''Religious democracy'' which is now a topic in contemporary [[Iranian philosophy]] and means that the values of [[religion]] play a role in the public arena in a society populated by religious people. Religious democracy falls within the framework of modern [[rationality]] and has identifiable elements. It is in this way that we have a plurality of democracies in the international community. "Religious democracy" is a subject of intense research in Iranian intellectual circles.

Democracy where coincides with certain things{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=seems ungramatical}}, it can be secular or religious. Hence, what alters the hue and color of democracy is a society’s specific characteristics and elements. Religious democracy is an example of how democratic values can exist in a different cultural elaboration than what is usually known before.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrights.dk/news/conference_article/&lt;/ref&gt; But, in a [[secular]] society, some other characteristic is deemed important and focused on, and that becomes the basis for [[democracy]].

In fact relativistic [[liberalism]] and democracy are not identical since democracy is not violated when a faith is embraced, it is violated when a particular belief is imposed or disbelief is punished.

We do not have one democracy but many democracies in history. We have a plurality of democracies in the international community. What emerged was that a democracy prevailed in different eras depending on the conditions of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drsoroush.com/English/Interviews/E-INT-20031200-1.htm AbdolKarim Soroush :: عبدالکريم سروش&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In 2008, in an online open poll, Soroush was voted the 7th topmost intellectual person in the world on the list of [[Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll|Top 100 Public Intellectuals]] by ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect Magazine]]'' ([[UK]]) and ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' ([[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930143349/http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/ |archivedate=2009-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks===
Soroush's ideas have met with strong opposition from conservative elements in the Islamic Republic. Both he and his audiences were assaulted by [[Ansar-e Hezbollah]] vigilantees in the mid-1990s. A law imposing penalties on anyone associating with enemies of the Islamic republic is thought by his allies to have been at least in part provoked by some of Soroush's lectures and foreign affiliations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''The Last Great Revolution'' by Robin Wright c2000, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the journalist [[Robin Wright (author)|Robin Wright]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the next year, he lost his three senior academic appointments, including a deanship. Other public appearances, including his Thursday lectures, were banned. He was forbidden to publish new articles. He was summoned for several long `interviews` by Iranian intelligence officials. His travel was restricted, then his passport confiscated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the celebration of the sixteenth anniversary of the [[Iran hostage crisis|American embassy seizure]] in 1995, Wright found that Iranian [[Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]] "devoted more time berating Soroush...than condemning the [[United States]] or [[Israel]]." &lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008, p.291-2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3015">{{For|the Soviet dissident poet|Alexander Galich (writer)}}
'''Alexander Ivanovich Galich''' ({{lang-ru|'''Александр Иванович Галич'''}}; 1783 – 1848) was a [[Russia]]n teacher, philosopher, and writer.

Galich was a teacher of Latin and Russian literature at the German [[Saint Peter's School]] (Petrischule) in [[St. Petersburg]], a professor at [[St. Petersburg University]], a teacher of [[Alexander Pushkin]], and a writer and philosopher who was one of the first followers of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] in Russia.

==Life==
Galich was born as '''Alexander Ivanovich Govorov''' in 1783 into the family of a deacon in [[Trubchevsk]] in [[Bryansk Oblast]]. From 1793–1803 he studied at [[Sevsk]] Theological Seminary. He then entered the [[Herzen University|St. Petersburg Teacher's Seminary]], which in 1804 was renamed to Main Pedagogical Institute. Here he changed his surname to "Galich" (before that he had once changed it to "Nikiforov").

In 1808, he went to study at the [[University of Helmstedt]] and the [[University of Göttingen]] in [[Germany]]. In 1813, he [[Thesis defense|defended his thesis]] at the Department of Philosophy of the St. Petersburg State Pedagogical Institute.

From 1814–1818 Galich taught at the Petrischule, the [[Tsarskoe Selo Lyceum]], and the Main Teacher's College. In 1819, the Main Teacher's College was reorganized as [[St. Petersburg University]], and Galich was the first member of the Faculty of Philosophy.

From 1818–1819, Galich published ''A History of Philosophical Systems'' in two volumes, compiled on the basis of German works by Sacher{{Who|date=February 2011}}, [[Georg Anton Friedrich Ast|Ast]], [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann|Tenneman]], and other German philosophers, and ending with an essay on the philosophical exposition of Schelling.

Shortly thereafter, charges were instituted against Galich and three other professors of impiety and revolutionary designs. In 1837, Galich, accused of [[Freethought|freethinking]], was laid off from St. Petersburg University. However, in the same year, he obtained a position in the Department of Archives.

In spite of his career problems, Galich continued to write and publish. His ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1845) was one of Russia's first philosophical reference works.

Most significant and broad in scope were two of his later works: ''Universal Rights'' and the ''Philosophy of Human History''. However, ill fortune did not abandon Galich: as soon as he had completed these works, they were destroyed in an accidental fire. Unable to survive this loss, Galich became ill and died in 1848.

'''Organizational ambidexterity''' refers to an organization's ability to be efficient in its [[management]] of today's business and also adaptable for coping with tomorrow's changing demand. Just as being [[Ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] means being able to use both the left and right hand equally, organizational ambidexterity requires the organizations to use both [[exploration]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] techniques to be successful.

== Origin and development ==

Organizational ambidexterity was defined as an organization's ability to be aligned and efficient in its management of today's business demands as well as being [[adaptive]] to changes in the environment at the same time.&lt;ref name=duncan1976&gt;Duncan, R. (1976). ''The ambidextrous organization: Designing dual structures for innovation''. Killman, R. H., L. R. Pondy, and D. Sleven (eds.) The Management of Organization. New York: North Holland. 167-188.&lt;/ref&gt; This term of organizational ambidexterity was first used by Duncan,&lt;ref name=duncan1976/&gt; however, it was [[James G. March|March]]&lt;ref name=march1991&gt;March, J. G. (1991). Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning. ''Organization Science, 2'', 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; that had been credited for developing and generating greater interest in this concept, especially in the late 20th and early 21st century. [[Ambidexterity]] in an organization is achieved by balancing [[exploration]] and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], which allows the organization to be [[creativity|creative]] and [[Adaptability|adaptable]], while also continuing to rely on more traditional, proven methods of business.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt; [[Exploration]] includes things such as search, variation, [[Risk|risk taking]], [[experiment]]ation, [[Stiffness|flexibility]], discovery or [[innovation]], whereas exploitation includes such things as refinement, [[choice]], [[production (economics)|production]], [[efficiency]], [[Selection (biology)|selection]], [[implementation]], and [[execution]].&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt; Companies that focus only on exploration face the risk of wasting resources on ideas that may not prove useful or never be developed. On the other hand, companies that focus only on exploitation may accept [[status quo]] performance and products and fail to reach optimal levels of success.

Organizational ambidexterity is defined broadly, and several other terms are also highly related or similar to the construct of ambidextrous organization, including [[organizational learning]], technological innovation, organizational [[adaptation]], [[strategic management]], and [[Organizational structure|organizational design]]. Things such as reconciling exploitation and exploration, the [[simultaneity]] of induced and autonomous strategy processes, synchronizing incremental and discontinuous innovation, and balancing search and stability also tend to refer to the same underlying construct as ambidextrous organization.&lt;ref name=raisch2008&gt;Raisch, S., &amp; Birkinshaw, J. (2008). Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators. ''Journal of Management, 34'', 375-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are studies on how structural and behavioral mechanisms affect organizational ambidexterity and studies on how ambidextrous organizational designs affect organizational ambidexterity. Whereas earlier studies on structural and behavioral mechanisms regarded the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation to be insurmountable, more recent research has paid attention to a range of organizational solutions to engender the existence of ambidexterity. One recent hot research topic in this area focused on the [[leadership]] characteristics that enable organizations to manage the contradictions that they face and achieve ambidexterity,&lt;ref name=beckman2006&gt;Beckman, C. M. (2006). The influence of founding team company affiliations on firm behavior.  ''Academy of Management Journal, 49'', 741-758.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lubatkin2006&gt;Lubatkin, M. H., Simsek, Z., Ling, Y., &amp; Veiga, J. F. (2006). Ambidexterity and performance in small- to medium-sized firms: The pivotal role of top management team behavioral integration. ''Journal of Management, 32'', 646-672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith2005&gt;Smith, W. K., &amp; [[Tushman, M. L.]] (2005). Managing strategic contradictions: A top management model for managing innovation streams. ''Organization Science, 16'', 522-536.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the origin of the concept ‘ambidextrous leadership’. Several antecedents, outcomes of organizational ambidexterity as well as related moderators have also been identified in the studies on structural and behavioral mechanisms.

== Ambidextrous organizational designs and organizational ambidexyerity==

The studies on "ambidextrous organizations" take the organization as the unit of analysis and ambidextrous organizing is conceptualized as the simultaneous pursuit and combination of incremental and discontinuous innovation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2004/04/the-ambidextrous-organization|title=The Ambidextrous Organization|date=2004-04-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=Michael|last2=O'Reilly|first2=C.|date=1997-01-15|title=Winning through Innovation: A Practical Guide to Leading Organizational Change and Renewal|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=200|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=M.|last2=Smith|first2=W.|date=2002-02-01|title=Organizational Technology: Technological Change, Ambidextrous Organizations and Organizational Evolution|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=11641|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ambidextrous organizations" are needed if the failure to balance exploitation and exploration is to be overcome: "the ability to pursue simultaneously both incremental and discontinuous innovation results from hosting multiple contradictory structures, processes, and cultures" (Tushman and O'Reilly, 1996: page 24).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tushman|first=Michael|last2=O'Reilly|first2=C.|date=1996-07-01|title=Ambidextrous Organizations: Managing Evolutionary and Revolutionary Change|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=2045|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been empirically found that competence exploitation is negatively related to radical innovation performance whereas the effect for competence exploration is positive; competence exploration will be more valuable to the firm when it is matched with lower levels of competence exploitation, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atuahene-Gima|first=Kwaku|date=2005|title=Resolving the Capability: Rigidity Paradox in New Product Innovation|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30166552|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=69|issue=4|pages=61–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that the "ambidextrous organization" does not solve the tension between alignment and adaptability but allows for coping with the tension between different types of alignment in order to produce incremental and discontinuous innovation. "Ambidextrous organizations" do not alternate between exploration and exploitation, but they do both simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/ambidexterity-dynamic-capability-resolving-innovators-dilemma|title=Ambidexterity as a dynamic capability: Resolving the innovator’s dilemma|work=Stanford Graduate School of Business|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There's work that empirically investigates the processes of ambidextrous organizing by analyzing the implementation of the "ambidextrous organizations" concept in order to study whether there is evidence on how companies applying the concepts (suggested by "ambidextrous organizations" proponents) actually manage the processes of exploitation and exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durisin|first=Boris|last2=Todorova|first2=Gergana|date=2012-10-15|title=A Study of the Performativity of the “Ambidextrous Organizations” Theory: Neither Lost in nor Lost before Translation|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2012.00981.x|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|language=en|volume=29|pages=53–75|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5885.2012.00981.x|issn=0737-6782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structural and behavioral mechanisms that lead to organizational ambidexterity==

Organizational ambidexterity can be considered primarily from two angles. One is architectural or structural ambidexterity, which uses dual [[organizational structure]]s and strategies to differentiate efforts towards exploitation and exploration.&lt;ref name=adler1999&gt;Adler, P., Goldoftas, B., &amp; Levine, D. (1999). Flexibility versus efficiency? A case study of model changeovers in the Toyota production system. ''Organization Science, 10'', 43-68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcdonough1983&gt;McDonough, E.

L.]], &amp; O’Reilly, C. A. (1996). Ambidextrous organizations: Managing evolutionary and revolutionary change. ''California Management Review, 38'', 8-30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Structural]] ambidexterity includes dual parts, with one part focusing on exploitation and the other focusing on exploration. It's also known as the spatial separation of the dual strategies concepts outlined above. The other approach is contextual ambidexterity, which uses [[behavioral]] and [[social]] means to integrate exploitation and exploration at the organizational unit level.&lt;ref name=gibson2004&gt;Gibson, C. B., &amp; Birkinshaw, J. (2004). The antecedents, consequences and mediating role of organizational ambidexterity.  ''Academy of Management Journal, 47'', 209-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarthy2011&gt;McCarthy, I.P., &amp; Gordon, B.R. (2011). Achieving Contextual Ambidexterity in R&amp;D Organizations: A Management Control System Approach. R&amp;D Management, 41, 240-258.&lt;/ref&gt; Contextual ambidexterity is a balanced type that takes a mid-level position between exploitation and exploration, also known as parallel structures or hybrid strategies.

Although both angles are related to the theme of organizational ambidexterity, they strongly differ in the way how they are configured. There has always been a debate of which of the two different approaches is right.  The dual type allows both discrete orientations and fit across dimensions at the unit level but creates a misfit between organizational units. Some researchers argued that inconsistent structures may lead to low performance.&lt;ref name=doty1986&gt;Doty, H. D., Glick, W. H., &amp; Huber, G. P. (1993). Fit, equifinality, and organizational effectiveness: A test of two configurational theories.

Generic strategies and performance: An empirical examination with American data Part I: Testing Porter.  ''Organization Studies, 7'', 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some researchers trying to investigate the external and internal [[Contingency theory|contingencies]] under which different configurations can be found. One factor would be the speed and type of [[technological change]] that organizations confront. On the other hand, the balanced type (i.e. contextual ambidexterity) is consistent with the systems approach of fit across multiple dimensions,&lt;ref name=drazin1985&gt;Drazin, R., &amp; Van de Ven, A. H. (1985). Alternative forms of fit in contingency theory. ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 30'', 514-539.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nadler1997&gt;Nadler, D., &amp; [[Tushman, M. L.]] (1997).

Being efficiently fickle: A dynamic theory of organizational choice. ''Organization Science, 13'', 547-566.&lt;/ref&gt; In an environment where changes are slow, there will be sufficient time to react to the radical changes by constructing dual structures and strategies. However, in a high-competitive environment, balanced structures may be better prepared to deal with the constant need for alignment.&lt;ref name=raisch2008/&gt; In future studies, the different organizational ambidexterity configurations can be compared to find a better solution for dealing with the exploitation and exploration paradox.

==Antecedents of organizational ambidexterity==

Ambidexterity is often considered a capacity or skill and can therefore be facilitated by either the organization as a whole or managers / [[CEO]]s.&lt;ref name=cantarello2012&gt;Cantarello, S., Martini, A., &amp; Nosella, A. (2012). A multi-level model for organizational ambidexterity in the search phase of the innovation process. ''Creativity and Innovation Management, 21'', 28-48.&lt;/ref&gt; From the structural ambidexterity's view, organizations can solve the paradox by temporarily cycling through periods of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and periods of [[exploration]].&lt;ref name=nickerson2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=brown1998&gt;Brown, S. L., &amp; Eisenhardt, K. (1998). ''Competing on the edge: Strategy as structured chaos''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=siggelkow2003&gt;Siggelkow, N., &amp; Levinthal, D. A. (2003). Temporarily divide to conquer: Centralized, decentralized, and reintegrated organizational approaches to exploration and adaptation.  ''Organization Science, 14'', 650-669.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=venkatraman2007&gt;Venkatraman, N., Lee, C. H., &amp; Iyer, B. (2007). ''Strategic ambidexterity and sales growth: A longitudinal test in the software sector''. Unpublished Manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt; From the other point of view (contextual ambidexterity), firms ought to address exploitation and exploration simultaneously and internally to achieve the goal ambidexterity.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; Contextual ambidexterity is more difficult to achieve than structural ambidexterity because managing two inconsistent alignments within an organization simultaneously is far more complex than managing one consistent strategy after another.&lt;ref name=gupta2006&gt;Gupta, A. K., Smith, K. G., &amp; Shalley, C. E. (2006). The interplay between exploration and exploitation. ''Academy of Management Journal, 4'', 693-706.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus most studies on how to build ambidextrous organizations in literature focused on contextual ambidexterity rather than structural ambidexterity.

The role of [[leadership|leaders]] (or managers) is always highlighted towards building an ambidextrous organization. Several recommendations have been made to organizations on how to achieve contextual ambidexterity, including using of meta-routines and [[Job enrichment|job-enrichment]] schemes,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; building [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] with supervisees,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; being supportive,&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; using complex behavioral repertoires,&lt;ref name=denison1995&gt;Denison, D., Hooijberg, R., &amp; Quinn, R. E. (1995). Paradox and performance: Toward a theory of behavioral complexity in managerial leadership. ''Organization Science, 6'', 524-540.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis2000&gt;Lewis, M. W. (2000). Exploring paradox: Toward a more comprehensive guide. ''Academy of Management Review, 25'', 760-776.&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of a shared vision.&lt;ref name=bartlett1989&gt;Bartlett, C. A., &amp; Ghoshal, S. (1989). ''Managing across borders: The transnational solution''. Boston: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several characteristics of [[organizational culture]] are also emphasized on building an ambidextrous organization. Successful organizations should be able to balance the hard elements ([[discipline]] and stretch) and the soft elements ([[support group|support]] and [[trust (social sciences)|trust]]) in their organizational contexts.&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; It was also suggested that establishing shared goals, developing a [[collective identity]], creating a culture of support, and giving personal meaning to individuals’ contributions to the overall purpose of an organization all contributes to ambidexterity.&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; A decentralized structure&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt; and a culture of excellence, [[recruitment]] and [[training]]&lt;ref name=bartlett1989/&gt; are also important aspects of establishing an ambidextrous organization.

== Outcomes of organizational ambidexterity==

Ambidexterity is beneficial to organizations in many aspects. As it is the ability to keep a balance between explorative and exploitative processes, the most core outcome of ambidexterity is innovation because innovation needs both explorative and exploitative aspects. [[Innovation]] is defined as "the sequence of activities by which a new element is introduced into a [[Level of analysis|social unit]], with the intention of benefiting the unit, some part of it, or the wider society" (West &amp; Farr, 1990). The new element need not be entirely novel or unfamiliar to members of the unit, but it must involve some discernible change or challenge to the [[status quo]] (West &amp; Farr, 1990).  Most theoretical models of innovation differentiate at least two processes: idea generation and idea [[implementation]] (e.g., Amabile, 1988; West, 2002). The generation phase is closely linked to explorative activities while the implementation phase is highly linked to exploitative activities. An ambidextrous organization is able to pursue innovation (creating new products/services) while also maintaining itself through the continued use of proven techniques/products.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt;

In addition, ambidexterity can promote some other positive organizational outcomes besides innovation. It has been proved in literature that the interaction between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies (in other words, ambidexterity) is positively related to sales [[Exponential growth|growth rate]], and imbalance between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is negatively related to sales growth rate (He &amp; Wong, 2004). Various organizations have been able to overcome organizational challenges and become more innovative because of ambidexterity.  A study looking at 41 businesses found that ambidexterity was highly correlated with [[performance]].&lt;ref name=gibson2004/&gt; Similarly, another study of 34 high-tech organizations showed that their ability to simultaneously execute exploration and exploitation was associated with higher performance (Chandrasekaran et al. 2012).

Companies such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[General Radio]], [[Nordstrom]] and [[British Airways]] have all had continued success throughout the years because of their capacity for ambidexterity. From 1981 to 1986, [[British Airways]] experienced increased profits and customer satisfaction. The top executives of [[British Airways]] credited the formation of a more ambidextrous [[culture]] and [[leadership]] with the company's improved performance.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt;

==Related moderators between organizational ambidexterity and organizational outcomes==

Moderators exist in the relationship between organizational ambidexterity and organizational outcomes. Environmental [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] and [[competitiveness]] moderate the relationship between exploitation/ [[exploration]] and [[performance]] (Levinthal &amp; March, 1993; Lewin, Long &amp; Carroll, 1999). Empirical studies also showed that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit's financial performance in more competitive environments (Jansen, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2006). Although they were not directly testing an ambidextrous orientation, results indicated a positive performance effect of simultaneously pursuing exploitative and exploratory innovation under high dynamic and competitive environments. The effects of exploitative, [[exploration|explorative]] and balanced corporate alignment activities on performance were compared under varying environmental conditions (Raisch &amp; Hotz, 2008). The construct of "environmental munificence" was developed to reflect an organization's opportunities and dynamism (Zahra, 1993). They found that, although exploration was positively related to performance under high environmental munificence, a balanced orientation failed to significantly affect performance in times of low environmental munificence (Raisch &amp; Hotz, 2008).

[[Market orientation]] was also proved to moderate the relationship between exploitation/ [[exploration]] and performance. [[Market orientation]] was defined as "the capability to generate, disseminate, and respond to intelligence pertaining to current and future customers" (Kohli &amp; Jaworski, 1990). A longitudinal study by Kyriakopoulos and Moorman (2004) showed that market orientation positively moderates the impact of pursuing high levels of exploitative and exploratory marketing strategies on new product performance; however, firms that pursue an ambidextrous orientation without strong market orientation display a significant reduction in new product financial performance.

Another factor that may moderate ambidexterity's effect on performance is firm [[resource]]s (Kyriakopoulos &amp; Moorman, 2004).&lt;ref name=venkatraman2007/&gt; Firms with rich resources have the ability to exploit and explore simultaneously, whereas firms with less resources may not be able to afford such a complex strategy. Similarly, Lubatkin et al.&lt;ref name=lubatkin2006/&gt; stated that small firms "lack the amount of slack resources and the kind of [[hierarchical]] administration systems that can help or impede larger firms in managing their contradictory knowledge processes and, thus, affect the attainment of ambidexterity" (p.&amp;nbsp;647). This idea was supported by empirical evidence that small firms may benefit more from a one-sided orientation than from mixed strategies (Ebben &amp; Johnson, 2005).

Boundary conditions were also addressed on choosing between [[structural]] and contextual ambidexterity. For example, spatial separation was suggested as an appropriate solution for environments characterized by long periods of stability, disrupted by rare events of discontinuous change.&lt;ref name=tushman1996/&gt; Research also found that firms operating in dynamic competitive environments rely on contextual ambidexterity rather than developing spatially separated units (Jansen, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2005).

== Levels of ambidexterity ==

The functional definition of ambidexterity was originally used to describe organizations, but recently this concept was extended to multiple organizational levels, including individuals, teams, and leaders. On the most general level, the concept of ambidexterity implies successfully managing the [[dichotomy]] of explorative variability creation and exploitative variability reduction.

Whenever there are needs to be both explorative and exploitive, [[conflict (process)|conflict]] occurs (Bledow, Frese, Anderson, Erez, &amp; Farr, 2009). That's when ambidexterity is necessary. Actually, regulating the conflicting demands of innovation is not only a challenge for the upper echelon of an organization but also a phenomenon that spans all levels of an organization. Employees as individuals, collectives of employees such as work teams, and the organization as a whole all have to find strategies to deal with conflicting demands in order to succeed in innovation and adaption to changing markets. Some examples of strategies and tactics that could be implemented at all three levels of analysis were also listed out (Bledow et al., 2009). These examples are presented in Table 1, including a separation strategy (in the Separation column) or an integration strategy (in the last two columns).

== Ambidextrous leadership ==

Recently the focus on organizational ambidexterity has become more concentrated on how leaders act ambidextrously to achieve organizational ambidexterity. Senior managers may be the key for facilitating the context and social base for ambidexterity. Noting that ambidextrous organizations require significant amounts of mobilization, coordination, and integration activities to maintain both exploitation and exploration, informal and social integration of the senior team as well as the cross-functional interfaces of the formal organization contribute to the success of organizational ambidexterity significantly (Jansen, Tempelaar, van den Bosch, &amp; [[Henk Volberda|Volberda]], 2009). A recent model of ambidexterity and leadership suggests that [[CEO]]s and top management teams (TMT) play an integral role in establishing ambidexterity in small-to-medium-sized organizations (Cao, Simsek, &amp; Zhang, 2010). The model suggests TMTs are where processes such as information sharing and knowledge processing, which influence ambidexterity, are likely to occur. Furthermore, it is the CEO who has the ability to access the most valuable and diverse information needed to avoid separation of explorative and exploitative behaviors. The greater the interface between TMTs and CEOs in small-to-medium-sized organizations, the greater the amount of ambidexterity.

The concept of ambidexterity was first formally introduced into the leadership area by the Rosing, Frese and Bausch (2011) paper, holding the idea that leaders should be able to lead their team to match the complexity and the pace of innovation (Ancona, Goodman, Lawrence, &amp; Tushman, 2001). Ambidextrous leadership was defined as the leaders’ ability to foster both explorative and exploitative behaviors in followers by increasing or reducing variance in their behavior and flexibly switching between those behaviors (Rosing et al., 2011).

The construct of ambidextrous leadership has also been linked to the combination of [[leadership styles]] (Jansen et al., 2009). Leaders who are transformational encourage "out of the box thinking", information sharing and question assumptions.[[Transformational leadership|Transformational leaders]] promote exploration and innovative thinking. [[Transactional leadership|Transactional leaders]] focus on making incremental improvements and making the best use of existing process. The transactional leadership style promotes exploitative behaviors. An ambidextrous leader is able to switch back and forth between transformation/exploration and transaction/exploitation as needed, in other words, being able to switch between different leadership styles at the appropriate time, in order to foster innovation and then implement plans. Ambidextrous leadership consists of three elements (1) opening leader behaviors to foster exploration, (2) closing leader behaviors to foster exploitation, (3) and the temporal flexibility to switch between both as the situation requires (Rosing et al., 2011). Opening leadership behaviors include: allowing for multiple ways to accomplish a task, experimentation and errors, whereas closing behaviors include; monitoring routines, sticking to plans and minimizing errors. The Rosing et al. (2011)'s model of leadership and innovation was shown in Figure 1.

==Controversy and future directions==

Some scholars as well as practitioners have argued that established companies simply lack the flexibility to explore new territories.&lt;ref name=lewis2000/&gt; One contributing reason could be the so-called [[success trap]] (i.e. the focus on their, historically successful, current business activities) (Walrave, Van Oorschot, &amp; Romme, 2011). A possible solution for big companies is to adopt a venture capital model – funding exploratory expeditions but otherwise not interfering too much with their operations. Another suggestion is for the use of [[cross-functional team]]s to achieve breakthrough innovations. Still others have suggested that a company may be able to alternate between different organizational models, focusing on exploitation and [[exploration]] at different time periods. For example, in a study of biotechnology firms it is shown how an organization's [[management control system]] can be adjusted periodically to achieve this changing focus on exploitation and exploration.&lt;ref name="mccarthy2011"/&gt; Researchers also debate if [[ambidexterity]] can be attained because [[exploration]] and exploitation tend to emerge from contradictory information and knowledge inputs and because success due to [[exploration]]/exploitation tends to be self-reinforcing leading to the use of the same methods in the future.&lt;ref name=march1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=floyd2000&gt;Floyd, S. W. &amp; Lane, P. J. (2000). "Strategizing throughout the Organization: Managing Role Conflict in Strategic Renewal". ''The Academy of Management Review, 25'', 154-177.&lt;/ref&gt; An empirical study of [[ambidexterity]] in organizations (He &amp; Wong, 2004) further cautions that very low levels of both [[exploration]] and exploitation are not sufficient to contribute to superior firm performance. High firm performance may however need to be sustained through continuous exploitation both on the market side, through [[business model]] innovation and technology innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaulio|first=Matti|last2=Thorén|first2=Kent|last3=Rohrbeck|first3=René|date=2017-12-01|title=Double ambidexterity: How a Telco incumbent used business-model and technology innovations to successfully respond to three major disruptions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/caim.12246/abstract|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=339–352|doi=10.1111/caim.12246|issn=1467-8691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambidexterity can also be hampered by employee desire to receive [[work motivation|organizational rewards]]. If organizations base their evaluation and [[reward system]]s on the completion of routine tasks, employees will be more likely to conform to standardized procedures.&lt;ref name=adler1999/&gt; To avoid hindering ambidexterity, organizations should be sure to reward innovative thinking as well as completion of routine tasks.

Despite the controversy surrounding the possibility of organizational ambidexterity, it is likely to continue to be a highly researched concept in the future. Future research is likely to focus on the role of ambidextrous leaders, ambidextrous teams and the [[Social environment|social context]] of organizational ambidexterity. (Rosing et al., 2011).

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Ann Catherine Scales was born in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]].  Her father [[James R. Scales]] was the President of [[Oklahoma Baptist University]] from 1961 to 1965.  He went on to be President of [[Wake Forest University]] from 1968 to 1983. Her mother, Elizabeth Ann Randel Scales, had also been a professor and was very active in the Red Cross and in arranging events at these universities.

Scales received her B.A. from [[Wellesley College]] in History and Philosophy in 1974 and her J.D. in 1978 from [[Harvard Law School]], where she served on Harvard Legal Aid and the Harvard Women's Law Association. She was a member of the committee that put together "Celebration 25", a party and conference held in 1978 to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first women graduating from Harvard Law School.&lt;ref name="strout1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Strout |first=Jean |title="I'm Only Gonna Tell You This One More Time:" Lessons from Ann Scales |url=http://harvardjlg.com/2012/07/im-only-gonna-tell-you-this-one-more-time-lessons-from-ann-scales/ |publisher=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender |accessdate=28 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801080411/http://harvardjlg.com/2012/07/im-only-gonna-tell-you-this-one-more-time-lessons-from-ann-scales/ |archivedate=1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project eventually turned into the Harvard Women's Law Journal, currently the Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender.

===Career===
Ann Scales taught at the [[University of New Mexico Law School]] for 18 years. She was a visiting professor at the [[University of Iowa College of Law]], [[Boston College Law School]], the [[University of British Columbia]] Faulty of Law, and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  At the time of her death, she was a professor at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law. Ann Scales was among the founders of the field of [[feminist jurisprudence]], and invented the term [[feminist jurisprudence]] in 1977 while planning a panel for Celebration 25.&lt;ref name="Scales2006"/&gt;

Throughout her career, Ann Scales practiced pro bono law in the fields of reproductive rights and GLBTI rights. She argued the case in which the [[New Mexico Supreme Court]] became the first high court of any state to hold that abortion funding is required by women's interest in equality. She also worked on the [[University of Colorado]] football gang rape case; the effort to bring a women's marathon to the Olympics; and R. v. Butler, a pornography case in which Canada's Supreme Court redefined obscenity based on the standard of harm it inflicts, particularly to women.&lt;ref name="strout1"/&gt;

Ann Scales was a former rodeo rider and was in part descended from Cherokee Native Americans.  Some of her ancestors walked the [[Trail of Tears]] from North Carolina to Oklahoma.

She died on June 24, 2012 in a hospice in Denver, CO as a result of massive brain trauma after a fall down the stairs in her home earlier in the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Sandlin|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/main/2012/06/25/obit-profiles/law-professor-feminist-scholar-challenged-the-status-quo.html |title=ABQJournal Online » Ann Scales: Law Professor, Feminist Scholar Challenged the Status Quo |publisher=Abqjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23123">The '''Aramaic New Testament''' of the [[Bible]] exists in two versions: 

:(1) the classical [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], or [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[New Testament]], part of the [[Peshitta]], translated from Greek in the early centuries of the church. 

:(2) the [[Assyrian Modern Version]] New Testament and [[Psalms]], published by the Bible Society in Lebanon (1997) and newly translated from [[Koine Greek]]. This version is mainly in use among Protestants.

The official [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (known by some as the Nestorian Church) does not recognise the new "Assyrian Modern" edition, and traditionally considers the New Testament of the Peshitta to be the original New Testament, and Aramaic to be its original language. This view was popularised in the West by the Assyrian Church of the East scholar [[George Lamsa]], but is not supported by the majority of scholars, either of the Peshitta or the [[Greek New Testament]].

The traditional New Testament of the Peshitta has 22 books, lacking the [[Second Epistle of John]], the [[Third Epistle of John]], the [[Second Epistle of Peter]], the [[Epistle of Jude]] and the [[Book of Revelation]], which are books of the [[Antilegomena]]. The text of Gospels also lacks the verses known as [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery]] (John 7:53–8:11) and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22%3A17-18 Luke 22:17–18].&lt;ref&gt;''The text of the New Testament: an introduction to the critical ... '' Page 194 Kurt Aland, Barbara Aland – 1995 "It contains twenty-two New Testament books, lacking the shorter Catholic letters (2–3 John, 2 Peter, Jude) and Revelation (as well as the Pericope Adulterae [John 7:53–8:11[ and Luke 22:17–18)."&lt;/ref&gt; These missing books were reconstructed by the [[Syriacist]] [[John Gwynn (professor)|John Gwynn]] in 1893 and 1897 from alternative manuscripts, and included them in the [[United Bible Societies]] edition of 1905. The 1997 modern Aramaic New Testament has all 27 books.

==Majority view==
{{main article|language of the New Testament}}
Mainstream and modern scholars have generally had a strong agreement that the New Testament was written in Greek and that an Aramaic source text was used for portions of the New Testament, especially the gospels. They acknowledge that many individual sayings of Jesus as found in the Greek Gospels may be translations from an Aramaic source referred to as "[[Q source|Q]]", but hold that the Gospels' text in its current form was composed in Greek, and so were the other New Testament writings. Scholars of all stripes have acknowledged the presence of scattered Aramaic expressions, written phonetically and then translated, in the Greek New Testament. Although it was frequently suggested that Q was a written source, it could have been a collection of oral sayings, usually referred to as the "logia". (See Luke 1:2,3).{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

An example of how mainstream scholars have dealt with Aramaic influences within an overall view of the Gospels' original Greek-language development may be found in [[Martin Hengel]]'s recent synthesis of studies of the linguistic situation in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the time of Jesus and the Gospels:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since non-literary, simple Greek knowledge or competency in multiple languages was relatively widespread in Jewish Palestine including Galilee, and a Greek-speaking community had already developed in Jerusalem shortly after Easter, one can assume that this linguistic transformation [from "the Aramaic native language of Jesus" to "the Greek Gospels"] began very early.  ...  [M]issionaries, above all 'Hellenists' driven out of Jerusalem, soon preached their message in the Greek language. We find them in Damascus as early as &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; 32 or 33. A certain percentage of Jesus' earliest followers were presumably bilingual and could therefore report, at least in simple Greek, what had been heard and seen. This probably applies to Cephas/Peter, Andrew, Philip or John. Mark, too, who was better educated in Jerusalem than the Galilean fishermen, belonged to this milieu.  The great number of phonetically correct Aramaisms and his knowledge of the conditions in Jewish Palestine compel us to assume a Palestinian Jewish-Christian author.  Also, the author's Aramaic native language is still discernible in the Marcan style.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Hengel. 2005. "Eye-witness Memory and the Writing of the Gospels: Form Criticism, Community Tradition and the Authority of the Authors."  In ''The Written Gospel'', ed. by Markus Bockmuehl and Donald A. Hagner. Cambridge University Press. Pp. 89f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Minority view - Aramaic original New Testament hypothesis==
The hypothesis of an Aramaic original for the New Testament holds that the original text of the [[New Testament]] was not [[Language of the New Testament|written in Greek, as held by the majority of scholars]], but in the [[Aramaic language]], which was the [[language of Jesus]] and the [[Apostles]].

The position of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] is that the Syriac [[Peshitta]] (a Bible version which is written in a [[Syriac language|vernacular form of Aramaic]]), used in that church, is the original of the New Testament. For instance, the patriarch [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] declared in 1957:
{{quote|With reference to... the originality of the Peshitta text, as the Patriarch and Head of the Holy Apostolic and Catholic Church of the East, we wish to state, that the Church of the East received the scriptures from the hands of the blessed Apostles themselves in the Aramaic original, the language spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and that the Peshitta is the text of the Church of the East which has come down from the Biblical times without any change or revision." (April 5, 1957){{cn|date=June 2017}}}}

The late [[list of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]], [[Dinkha IV]] (1976–2015), did not publicly pronounce that the Peshitta is the original New Testament. Variants of this view are held by some individuals who may argue for a lost Aramaic text preceding the Peshitta as the basis for the New Testament.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

This view is to be distinguished from the view held by most [[historical criticism|historical critics]], that the [[Greek New Testament]] (particularly the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Mark]]) may have had Aramaic [[source text]]s which are no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the [[Hebrew Gospel hypothesis]] of Lessing and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most noteworthy advocate of the "Peshitta-original" hypothesis in the West was [[George Lamsa]] of the Aramaic Bible Center. A tiny minority of more recent scholars are backers of the Peshitta-original theory today,&lt;ref&gt;Notably website owners Andrew Gabriel Roth (compiler of the "Aramaic-English New Testament") and Paul Younan. See Michael L. Brown, ''60 Questions Christians Ask About Jewish Beliefs and Practices'' (Bloomington, MN: Chosen Books, 2011), p.179.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the overwhelming majority of scholars consider the Peshitta New Testament to be a translation from a Greek original. For instance the noted Assyriologist Sebastian Brock wrote:

{{quote|The only complete English translation of the Peshitta is by G. Lamsa. This is unfortunately not always very accurate, and his claims that the Peshitta Gospels represent the Aramaic original underlying the Greek Gospels are entirely without foundation; such views, which are not infrequently found in more popular literature, are rejected by all serious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sebastian P | last = Brock | title = The Bible in the Syriac tradition | year = 2006 | page = 58}}. See also Raymond Brown et al., eds., "The Jerome Biblical Commentary" (London, 1970), 69:88 (article "Texts and Versions"): "Claims that the Syriac Gospels are the form in which Jesus spoke hsi teaching - claims often made by people who have every reason to know better - are without foundation."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some advocates of the "Peshitta-original" theory also use the term "Aramaic primacy", though this is not used in academic sources, and appears to be a recent [[neologism]], as is the phrase "Greek primacy", used to characterize the consensus view. The expression "Aramaic primacy" was used by L. I. Levine,&lt;ref&gt;(‘’Judaism and Hellenism in antiquity: conflict or confluence’’, 1998, p.82)&lt;/ref&gt; but only as a general expression used to denote the primacy of Aramaic over [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and Greek in Jerusalem during the [[Second Temple]] period (i.e. roughly 200 BC - 70 AD). The earliest appearance of the phrase in print appears to be in David Bauscher.&lt;ref&gt;''The Original Aramaic Gospels in Plain English'' (2007), p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Cutler Torrey, while teaching at Yale, wrote a series of books that presented detailed manuscripturial evidence supporting the Aramaic New Testament, starting with ''The Translations Made from the Original Aramaic Gospels'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnvayx|title=The Translations made from the Original Aramaic Gospels|last=Torrey|first=Charles Cutler|publisher=Macmillan Co.|year=1912|isbn=9781293971314|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and including the widely known ''Our Translated Gospels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fourgospelsanewt009081mbp/page/n0|title=The Four Gospels: a new translation|last=Torrey|first=Charles Cutler|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers|year=1933|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional evidence for the Aramaic origin is presented by Edwin Abbott in his Diatessarica series.

==Brief history==
[[George Lamsa]]'s translation of the [[Peshitta]] New Testament from [[Syriac language|Syriac]] into [[English language|English]] brought the claims for primacy of the Aramaic New Testament to the West.

===Historical criticism===
The best evidence for at least one of the Greek books of the New Testament to have been translated out of the Aramaic, comes from a [[Historical criticism|textual analysis]] of those attributed to the [[Apostle John]]. Their variation in writing style is so considerable, that it would preclude them having been written in Greek by the same author. St [[Dionysius of Alexandria]] lent support to this argument, when pointing out how John's style of writing differs so markedly between his Gospel and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. He concluded that the sophisticated writer of the former could not have written the clumsy Greek of the latter. Thus, the only way for John to have been the author of Revelation is for it to have been penned by a translator. However, Dionysius himself left open the possibility that it was written in Greek "by a holy and inspired writer" other than John.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''The History of the Church''. VII, 24:1-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to Papias===
[[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] provides a very early source for the idea that the canonical Gospels were either based on some non-Greek written sources, or (in the case of Matthew) possibly "composed" in a non-Greek language.  The relevant fragments of Papias' lost work ''An Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord'' (''Logiōn kuriakōn exēgēsis'', ''c.'' 110–140) are preserved in quotations by [[Eusebius]]. In one fragment, Papias cites an older source who says, "When Mark was the interpreter [''hermēneutēs'', possibly "translator"] of Peter, he wrote down accurately everything that he recalled of the Lord's words and deeds."  Papias' surviving comment about Matthew is more tantalizing, but equally cryptic: "And so Matthew composed [or collected] the sayings [or record] in the Hebrew tongue, and each one interpreted [''hēprormēneusen'', possibly "translated"] them to the best of his ability."&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia ecclesiastica'' 3.39.15–16, as translated by Bart D. Ehrman, ''The Apostolic Fathers'', Vol. II, [[Loeb Classical Library]], 2003, p. 103. For the word translated "composed," Ehrman prints ''sunetaxato'' in his facing-page Greek text, rather than the variant reading found in some manuscripts, ''sunegrapsato''. But, whereas ''sunegrapsato'' definitely means "composed," other scholars have taken the reading ''sunetaxato'' to mean "collected."  The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' offers a fuller discussion in the section of its [[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Gospel of St. Matthew|article on the Gospel of St. Matthew]] entitled "Authenticity of the First Gospel," and [[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/St. Papias|in the article on Papias]].&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar claim comes out more clearly in a text by [[Irenaeus]], but this testimony is later than (and may be based on) Papias.

Even if they do imply non-Greek originals, these accounts have been doubted{{by whom|date=December 2016}}, in part with an argument that the literary quality of the Greek of these books indicates that the Greek would be the original. This argument extends to the other books where the Church Fathers accepted Greek as the original without debate. The Greek New Testament's general agreement with the [[Septuagint]] is also counted as evidence by majority view scholars. Aramaic primacists point to quotations from the Hebrew (Masoretic) Old Testament in the [[Alexandrian text type]] that indicate at one point a non-Greek speaking audience was addressed (See [[Matthew 2:15]], [[Matthew 2:18|2:18]], 11:10; Mark 1:2; Luke 7:27; John 19:37; Acts 13:18; Romans 9:33, 11:35; 1 Corinthians 3:19; 1Peter 2:8).&lt;ref&gt;Clontz, pp. 2,3,15,52,109,189,222,268,271,280,381&lt;/ref&gt; Aramaic primacists question why the New Testament would quote from the Hebrew Old Testament and not from the Septuagint if it was written in Greek originally. Quotes from the Hebrew Old Testament are present in Alexandrian texts that are thought to predate Jerome's use of the Hebrew Old Testament for the Vulgate.

===Response to specific verses===
There are also alternative explanations for the cases where Aramaic Primacists claim that the Aramaic seems to read better. One example (as stated above) is in the case of the "camel through the eye of a needle." In Jewish and Christian literature we see the following:

:"...who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a needle."
:- Babylonian Talmud, Baba Mezi'a, 38b

:"They do not show a man a palm tree of gold, nor an elephant going through the eye of a needle."
:- Babylonian Talmud, Berakoth, 55b

:"13 There was a rich man named Onesiphorus who said: If I believe, shall I be able to do wonders? Andrew said: Yes, if you forsake your wife and all your possessions. He was angry and put his garment about Andrew's neck and began to beat him, saying: You are a wizard, why should I do so? 14 Peter saw it and told him to leave off. He said: I see you are wiser than he. What do you say? Peter said: ''I tell you this: it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.''"
:- Apocryphal [[Acts of Peter and Andrew]].

Aramaic Primacists, most notably Lamsa, generally respond that these sources are late compared to the account in [[Q source|Q]], as the [[Mishnah]], the base document of the [[Babylonian Talmud]] was compiled in 200, where the [[Acts of Peter and Andrew]] is a 3rd-century work and therefore the original mistranslation of גמלא (''gamlâ'') predates and is potentially the source of these subsequent paraphrases. The Aramaic word for camel can also mean "rope" thus saying "it easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle".

The Disciples New Testament by Victor Alexander, a native Aramaic speaker, uses an idiomatic approach to the translation and contributes much in this area. The American Christian Press has produced an interlinear version of the New Testament in 3 volumes. Dr. Rocco Errico has translated the Gospel of Matthew in a parallel edition with useful footnotes.

'''''Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical''''' is a 1995 book by [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] tracing the intellectual roots of 20th-century Russian-American novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] and the philosophy she developed, [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].

The book is the second volume in a trilogy of books on dialectics and libertarianism. ''The Russian Radical'' explores Rand's college influences and intellectual roots—particularly the role of Rand's philosophy teacher, philosopher [[Nicholas Onufrievich Lossky]]—and argued that Rand's [[philosophical method]] was [[dialectical]] in nature.

==Background==
Sciabarra was first introduced to Rand's ideas while in high school, but began serious study of her in relation to dialectical thinking while working on his doctoral degree at [[New York University]]. In 1984 he began a "systematic study of the dialectical aspects of Rand's philosophy," research that eventually led to the book.&lt;ref name="sciab9"/&gt;

Sciabarra had difficulty securing a publisher. As he described it ten years later, many academic presses were uninterested in publishing a book about Rand, while commercial presses were put off by the scholarly nature of the content. The book was eventually published by the [[Pennsylvania State University Press]] in August 1995. It is the second volume in a three-book series by Sciabarra called "Dialectics and Liberty", which he conceived while working on his dissertation. On account of publishing delays, its predecessor, ''Marx, Hayek, and Utopia,'' came out that same month.&lt;ref name="tenyears"/&gt;

==Summary==

===Part One: The Process of Becoming===
In his introduction, Sciabarra briefly describes the difficulties facing the Rand scholar, then provides a quick overview of [[dialectics]]. Part One, "The Process of Becoming," examines Rand's intellectual development out of her Russian background.  Chapter 1 describes the various currents in Russian philosophy during Rand's childhood and youth, including the views of the [[Slavophile]]s, of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], of various literary figures of the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry|Silver Age]], and of Russian [[Marxism|Marxists]]. Chapter 2 focuses on [[Nicholas Onufrievich Lossky|Lossky's]] teachings, which "exhibited a Russian proclivity to synthesize opposites and resolve antagonisms. He rejected the dualistic obsession with dichotomies of rationalism or empiricism, idealism or materialism, knowledge or existence. These alternatives were, for him, partial and incomplete. Like other thinkers in Russian philosophy, however, Lossky achieved the ultimate integration through a mystical Absolute."&lt;ref name="sciab65"/&gt; According to Sciabarra, Rand would join Lossky in rejecting all of these dichotomies, but did not accept his appeal to religious [[faith]]. In Chapter 3 discusses Rand's education at the Stoiunin Gymnasium, at a high school in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], and at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]], where she majored in history. Chapter 4 surveys Rand's maturation as a thinker after she emigrated to the United States in 1926, taking on such controversies as whether she was in a "[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] phase" when she wrote her first novel, ''[[We the Living]]''.

===Part Two: The Revolt against Dualism===
In Part Two, "The Revolt against Dualism," Sciabarra presents Rand's mature philosophical system, emphasizing its dialectical aspects. Chapter 5 offers a treatment of the [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] [[metaphysics]], including Rand's emphatic opposition to the ideas of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Sciabarra says that Lossky was "the chief Russian translator of Kant's works.  He too had criticized Kant's contention that true being (things-in-themselves) transcends [[consciousness]] and remains forever unknowable."&lt;ref name="sciab153"/&gt; Chapter 6 surveys Objectivist [[epistemology]], including Rand's views on [[perception]], [[concept]]s, and [[free will]]; Sciabarra ties Rand's emphasis on the role of contextuality in concept formation to the importance of [[internal relations]] in dialectical thinking. In Chapter 7 Sciabarra takes on Rand's conception of the relations between reason and [[emotion]], drawing attention to the psychological theories that she developed in collaboration with [[Nathaniel Branden]]. Chapter 8 brings together Rand's theories about the nature and function of art, and her critiques, subsequently elaborated by [[Leonard Peikoff]], of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]]. Chapter 9 offers a lengthy examination of Rand's [[ethics|ethical theory]], focusing on her reworking of [[egotism|egoism]], her critique of [[altruism]], and the relationship between her conception of morality and [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[eudaimonia|eudaimonism]].  Chapter 10 completes the survey with Rand's [[political philosophy]], which Sciabarra identifies as a form of [[libertarianism]].  Sciabarra discusses the reciprocal relations between reason and freedom, and between faith and force; Rand's defense of [[individual rights]]; her distinctive "nondualistic conception of government, one that is neither [[anarchism|anarchistic]] nor [[statism|statist]] in its orientation";&lt;ref name="sciab282"&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her defense of capitalism, which he contrasts with [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] critique.

===Part Three: The Radical Rand===
Part Three of Sciabarra's book discusses the application of Rand's ideas to political, social and historical issues.  In Chapter 11, he diagrams Rand's analysis of power relations, in which Level 3 (economic and political functioning), Level 2 (linguistic and ideological functioning) and Level 1 (individual psycho-epistemological and ethical functioning) are all interrelated.  He connects Rand's insight that "a leash is only a rope with a noose at both ends" (''[[The Fountainhead]]'') and her conception of "the sanction of the victim" (''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'') with [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s analysis of the codependency between master and slave.  Chapter 12, "The Predatory State," traces Rand's account of the dynamics of the [[mixed economy]], her analyses of racism and [[tribalism]], and her rejection of both political conservatism and political liberalism.  Chapter 13 is concerned with Rand's [[philosophy of history]], which rejects Marxist [[dialectical materialism|materialism]] in favor of the view that "a society's history is a logical unfolding of the philosophical premises it has internalized,"&lt;ref name="sciab359"&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes with her vision of the rise of the New Intellectuals, who "conquer dualism and reunite the prodigal sons of capitalism: the intellectual and the businessman"&lt;ref name="sciab370"&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ultimate emergence of an Objectivist society.

===The second edition===
In 2013, Pennsylvania State University Press published an expanded second edition of the book, which included a new preface and three new appendices. The first appendix is a reprint of a 1999 essay, "The Rand Transcript," first published in ''[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', which includes an examination of the actual transcript of Rand's coursework at [[Petrograd University]].  The second appendix is a reprint of a 2005 ''Journal of Ayn Rand Studies'' essay, "The Rand Transcript, Revisited."  The third appendix answers a critique of Sciabarra's historical work by Shoshana Milgram.  The second edition also includes an expanded discussion of Rand's radical critique of [[U.S. foreign policy]], "The Welfare-Warfare State," now included in Chapter 12 of the book.  The book also includes a much expanded index and bibliography.

==Reception==
In a review for ''[[The Freeman]]'', David Brown wrote, "Much to my surprise the author of ''Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical'', a comprehensive new study of Rand's thought and its genesis in Russian culture, has persuaded me that something called 'dialectics' is integral to Ayn Rand's philosophic approach and crucial to its success. ''Russian Radical'' is a different kind of look at Ayn Rand, a full-fledged 'hermeneutic' on the contours, development, and interpretation of her thought."&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; According to a review by Lester H. Hunt in ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'', "It is indicative of the interest of this book that I have so far engaged in an argument with it instead of saying how good I think it is on the whole. Among other things, it is an excellent synthesis of the Objectivist literature, both the works of Rand and those of her immediate successors. Sciabarra's mastery of enormous amounts of material is almost literally incredible. He also manages to break entirely new ground on several different issues."&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;

In her biography ''[[Goddess of the Market]]'', Jennifer Burns wrote, "The first author to integrate Rand's life and thought was Chris Sciabarra […].  Though written without access to Rand's personal papers, Sciabarra's book employed original research and brought to light hitherto unknown information about Rand's educational background."&lt;ref name ="burns296" /&gt;

A mixed review by [[James G. Lennox]] said, "Its author has an encyclopedic familiarity with the writings of Ayn Rand and with virtually everyone who has advocated, commented on, or written critically about Objectivism. ... He is the first of her commentators to explore the intellectual milieu of Rand's early, formative years, providing a deeper appreciation for her occasional scathing remarks about Russian culture as she had experienced it. All of this material is discussed, and exhaustively referenced, in the interests of providing a comprehensive analysis of Objectivism, not merely as a philosophical system, but as a philosophical and cultural movement." However, Lennox questioned whether Ayn Rand had ever taken a philosophy course from Lossky, let alone been influenced by his own philosophical method, and he recommended against construing Rand's method of challenging dichotomies or "false alternatives" as dialectical.&lt;ref name=lennox/&gt; 

''The Russian Radical'' received a negative review from [[John Ridpath]], a director of the [[Ayn Rand Institute]]. Ridpath claimed that ''The Russian Radical'' was [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[deconstruction]]ist in its overall orientation, that it was one of the "worthless products" of contemporary academia, and that on the whole it was "preposterous in its thesis, destructive in its purpose, and tortuously numbing in its content."&lt;ref name=ridpath/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3381">The '''Caribbean Philosophical Association''' ('''CPA''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[organization]] founded in 2002 at the Center for Caribbean Thought at the [[University of the West Indies]], in [[Mona, Jamaica]]. The founding members were [[George Belle]], [[B. Anthony Bogues]], [[Patrick Goodin]], [[Lewis Gordon]], [[Clevis Headley]], [[Paget Henry]], [[Nelson Maldonado-Torres]], [[Charles Mills (political scientist)|Charles Mills]], and [[Supriya Nair]]. The association promotes the view that philosophy is the "rigorous theoretical reflection about fundamental problems faced by humanity", and that Caribbean philosophy in particular should be seen as "a transdisciplinary form of interrogation informed by scholarly knowledges as well as by practices and artistic expressions that elucidate fundamental questions that emerge in contexts of 'discovery,' conquest, racial, gender, and sexual domination, genocide, dependency, and exploitation as well as freedom, emancipation, and [[decolonization]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeanphilosophicalassociation.org/index.html CPA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization sponsors an annual meeting&lt;ref&gt;[http://pbos.com/?p=36 "Caribbean Philosophical Association"], Philosophy Born of Struggle, 4 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sta.uwi.edu/news/ecalendar/event.asp?id=629 Campus Events Calendar| Caribbean Philosophical Association (CPA) 2009], Campus News, The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine (Trinidad and Tobago).&lt;/ref&gt; and offers prizes for work that furthers the decolonization and liberation of mankind.

[[File:Simplified_Structure_of_the_Linux_Kernel.svg|thumb|Location of the "Completely Fair Scheduler" (a process scheduler) in a simplified structure of the Linux kernel.]]
The '''Completely Fair Scheduler''' ('''CFS''') is a [[process scheduler]] which was merged into the 2.6.23 (October 2007) release of the [[Linux]] [[Linux kernel|kernel]] and is the default scheduler. It handles [[central processing unit|CPU]] resource allocation for executing [[process (computing)|processes]], and aims to maximize overall CPU utilization while also maximizing interactive performance.

[[Con Kolivas]]'s work with scheduling, most significantly his implementation of "[[Fair-share scheduling|fair scheduling]]" named [[Rotating Staircase Deadline]], inspired [[Ingo Molnár]] to develop his CFS, as a replacement for the earlier [[O(1) scheduler]], crediting Kolivas in his announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list 
       | last=Molnár
       | first=Ingo
       | authorlink=Ingo Molnár

       | mailinglist=linux-kernel
       | date=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the previous O(1) scheduler used in older Linux 2.6 kernels, the CFS scheduler implementation is not based on [[run queue]]s. Instead, a [[red–black tree]] implements a "timeline" of future task execution. Additionally, the scheduler uses [[nanosecond]] granularity accounting, the atomic units by which an individual process' share of the CPU was allocated (thus making redundant the previous notion of timeslices). This precise knowledge also means that no specific [[heuristics]] are required to determine the interactivity of a process, for example.&lt;ref name="kt8059"&gt;{{cite web|last=Andrews |first=Jeremy |date=2007-04-18 |url=http://kerneltrap.org/node/8059 |title=Linux: The Completely Fair Scheduler |publisher=[[KernelTrap]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419102054/http://kerneltrap.org/node/8059 |archivedate=2007-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the old O(1) scheduler, CFS uses a concept called "sleeper fairness", which considers sleeping or waiting tasks equivalent to those on the runqueue. This means that interactive tasks which spend most of their time waiting for user input or other events get a comparable share of CPU time when they need it.

==Algorithm==
The data structure used for the scheduling algorithm is a [[red-black tree]] in which the nodes are scheduler-specific &lt;code&gt;sched_entity&lt;/code&gt; structures. These are derived from the general &lt;code&gt;task_struct&lt;/code&gt; process descriptor, with added scheduler elements.

The nodes are indexed by processor "''execution time''" in nanoseconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-completely-fair-scheduler/ CFS description at ibm.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A "''maximum execution time''" is also calculated for each process. This time is based upon the idea that an "ideal processor" would equally share processing power amongst all processes. Thus, the ''maximum execution time'' is the time the process has been waiting to run, divided by the total number of processes, or in other words, the ''maximum execution time'' is the time the process would have expected to run on an "ideal processor".

When the scheduler is invoked to run a new process,  the operation of the scheduler is as follows:
# The leftmost node of the scheduling tree is chosen (as it will have the lowest spent ''execution time''), and sent for execution.
# If the process simply completes execution, it is removed from the system and scheduling tree.
# If the process reaches its ''maximum execution time'' or is otherwise stopped (voluntarily or via interrupt) it is reinserted into the scheduling tree based on its new spent ''execution time''.
# The new leftmost node will then be selected from the tree, repeating the iteration.

If the process spends a lot of its time sleeping, then its spent time value is low and it automatically gets the priority boost when it finally needs it. Hence such tasks do not get less processor time than the tasks that are constantly running.

==OS background==
{{Confusing|section|date=October 2009}}
CFS is an implementation of a well-studied, classic scheduling algorithm called [[weighted fair queuing]].&lt;ref name="dwrr"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = T. | last2 = Baumberger | first2 = D. | last3 = Hahn | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1145/1594835.1504188 | title = Efficient and scalable multiprocessor fair scheduling using distributed weighted round-robin | journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 65 | year = 2009 | url = http://happyli.org/tongli/papers/dwrr.pdf | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally invented for [[packet network]]s, fair queuing had been previously applied to CPU scheduling under the name [[stride scheduling]].  However, CFS uses terminology different from that normally applied to fair queuing. "Service error" (the amount by which a process's obtained CPU share differs from its expected CPU share) is called "wait_runtime" in Linux's implementation, and "queue virtual time" (QVT) is called "fair_clock".

The fair queuing CFS scheduler has a scheduling complexity of O([[Logarithm|log]] N), where N is the number of tasks in the [[run queue|runqueue]]. Choosing a task can be done in constant time, but reinserting a task after it has run requires O(log N) operations, because the runqueue is implemented as a [[red-black tree]].

CFS is the first implementation of a fair queuing [[process scheduler]] widely used in a general-purpose operating system.&lt;ref name="dwrr"/&gt;

==Fairer algorithms==
Technically, the name "Completely Fair Scheduler" is not entirely correct, since the algorithm only guarantees the "unfair" level to be less than ''O''(''n''), where ''n'' is the number of processes. There are more complicated algorithms{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} which can give better bounds over the "unfair" levels (e.g. ''O''(log ''n'')). {{Clarify|date=April 2010}}

The Linux kernel received a patch for CFS in November 2010 for the 2.6.38 kernel that has made the scheduler ''fairer'' for use on desktops and workstations. Developed by Mike Galbraith using ideas suggested by [[Linus Torvalds]], the patch implements a feature called autogrouping that ''significantly'' boosts interactive desktop performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_2637_video&amp;num=1 The ~200 Line Linux Kernel Patch That Does Wonders]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The explanation of the basic algorithm implementation was included by Mike Galbraith in a post about the patch:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list 
       | last=Galbraith

       | url=http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=128978361700898&amp;w=2
       | mailinglist=linux-kernel
       | date=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Each task's signal struct contains an inherited pointer to a refcounted autogroup struct containing a task group pointer, the default for all tasks pointing to the init_task_group.  When a task calls __proc_set_tty(), the process wide reference to the default group is dropped, a new task group is created, and the process is moved into the new task group.  Children thereafter inherit this task group, and increase its refcount.  On exit, a reference to the current task group is dropped when the last reference to each signal struct is dropped.  The task group is destroyed when the last signal struct referencing it is freed.   At runqueue selection time, IFF a task has no cgroup assignment, its current autogroup is used.

The feature is enabled from boot by default if CONFIG_SCHED_AUTOGROUP is selected, but can be disabled via the boot option noautogroup, and can be also be turned on/off on the fly.}}

The primary issues solved by this are for multi-core as well as multi-cpu ([[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]]) systems experiencing increased interactive response times while performing other tasks that use many CPU-intensive threads in those tasks.  A simple explanation is that, with this patch applied, one will be able to still watch a video, read email and perform other typical desktop activities without glitches or choppiness while, say, compiling the [[Linux kernel]] or encoding video.

Initial patches for the autogroup feature tied grouping to a tty (terminal), but the eventually merged patch settled on an implementation that tied groups to sessions created via the [http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html &lt;code&gt;setsid()&lt;/code&gt;] system call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list 
       | last=Galbraith

       | mailinglist=linux-kernel
       | date=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autogroup feature implements task group creation only for fair class tasks (that is, processes scheduled according to the default SCHED_OTHER policy, but not, for example, processes scheduled under realtime policies) and, as such, leaves the way open for enhancement.  Even at this basic implementation this patch can make [[Linux]] on the desktop a reality for all those who have found desktop performance to be less than desired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.computerworld.com/17371/the_linux_desktop_may_soon_be_a_lot_faster The Linux desktop may soon be a lot faster]&lt;/ref&gt;
As [[Linus Torvalds]] put it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list 
       | last=Torvalds

Good job. Group scheduling goes from "useful for some specific server loads" to "that's a killer feature".}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6856">A '''consensus theory of truth''' is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them.

==Varieties of consensus==
===Consensus gentium===

An ancient criterion of truth, the ''[[consensus gentium]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''agreement of the people''), states "that which is universal among men carries the weight of truth" (Ferm, 64).  A number of consensus theories of truth are based on variations of this principle.  In some criteria the notion of universal consent is taken strictly, while others qualify the terms of consensus in various ways.  There are versions of consensus theory in which the specific population weighing in on a given question, the proportion of the population required for consent, and the period of time needed to declare consensus vary from the classical norm.

===Consensus as a regulative ideal===

A ''[[descriptive theory]]'' is one that tells how things are, while a ''[[normative theory]]'' tells how things ought to be.  Expressed in practical terms, a normative theory, more properly called a ''[[policy]]'', tells agents how they ought to act.  A policy can be an absolute imperative, telling agents how they ought to act in any case, or it can be a contingent directive, telling agents how they ought to act ''if'' they want to achieve a particular goal.  A policy is frequently stated in the form of a piece of advice called a ''[[heuristic]]'', a ''[[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]'', a ''[[norm (philosophy)|norm]]'', a ''[[:wikt:rule|rule]]'', a ''[[slogan]]'', and so on.  Other names for a policy are a ''recommendation'' and a ''[[regulative principle]]''.

A regulative ideal can be expressed in the form of a description, but what it describes is an ideal state of affairs, a condition of being that constitutes its aim, end, goal, intention, or objective.  It is not the usual case for the actual case to be the ideal case, or else there would hardly be much call for a policy aimed at achieving an ideal.

Corresponding to the distinction between actual conditions and ideal conditions there is a distinction between actual consensus and ideal consensus.  A theory of truth founded on a notion of actual consensus is a very different thing from a theory of truth founded on a notion of ideal consensus.  Moreover, an ideal consensus may be ideal in several different ways.  The state of consensus may be ideal in its own nature, conceived in the matrix of actual experience by way of intellectual operations like abstraction, extrapolation, and limit formation.  Or the conditions under which the consensus is conceived to be possible may be formulated as idealizations of actual conditions.  A very common type of ideal consensus theory refers to a community that is an idealization of actual communities in one or more respects.

==Critiques==
It is very difficult to find any philosopher of note who asserts a ''bare'', ''naive'', or ''pure'' consensus theory of truth, in other words, a treatment of truth that is based on actual consensus in an actual community without further qualification.  One obvious critique is that not everyone agrees to consensus theory, implying that it may not be true by its own criteria.  Another problem is defining how we know that consensus is achieved without falling prey to an infinite regress. Even if everyone agrees to a particular proposition, we may not know that it is true until everyone agrees that everyone agrees to it. Bare consensus theories are frequent topics of discussion, however, evidently because they serve the function of reference points for the discussion of alternative theories.

If consensus equals truth, then truth can be made by forcing or organizing a consensus, rather than being discovered through experiment or observation, or existing separately from consensus. The principles of mathematics also do not hold under consensus truth because mathematical propositions build on each other. If the consensus declared 2+2=5 it would render the practice of mathematics where 2+2=4 impossible.

'''Culpability''', or being '''culpable''', is a measure of the degree to which an agent, such as a person, can be held [[Moral responsibility|morally]] or [[law|legally]] responsible for action and inaction. Culpability marks the dividing line between [[moral evil]], like murder, for which someone may be held legally responsible and a randomly occurring event, like [[earthquake]]s, for which no human can be held responsible. One formulation of the concept is as follows:

{{quotation|A person is culpable if they cause a negative event and&lt;br&gt;(1) the act was intentional;&lt;br&gt;(2) the act and its consequences could have been controlled (i.e., the agent knew the likely consequences, the agent was not coerced, and the agent overcame hurdles to make the event happen); and&lt;br&gt;(3) the person provided no excuse or justification for the actions.&lt;ref&gt;Blair H. Sheppard, Roy J. Lewicki, John W. Minton, ''Organizational Justice: The Search for Fairness in the Workplace'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Culpability descends from the [[Latin]] concept of fault (''[[culpa (disambiguation)|culpa]]''). The concept of culpability is intimately tied up with notions of [[moral agency|agency]], freedom, and [[free will]]. All are commonly held to be [[necessary condition|necessary]], but not [[sufficient condition|sufficient]], conditions for culpability.

==In law==
From a legal perspective, culpability describes the degree of one's ''blameworthiness'' in the commission of a [[crime]] or [[Offense (law)|offense]].  Except for [[strict liability]] crimes, the type and severity of punishment often follow the degree of culpability. "Culpability means, first and foremost, direct involvement in the wrongdoing, such as through participation or instruction", as compared with responsibility merely arising from "failure to supervise or to maintain adequate controls or ethical culture".&lt;ref&gt;Marco Arnone, Leonardo S. Borlini, ''Corruption: Economic Analysis and International Law'' (2014), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern criminal codes in the [[United States]] usually make distinct four degrees of culpability.

Legal definitions of culpability are:
#A person acts purposely (criminally) with respect to a material element of an offense when:
##if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result; and
##if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist.
#A person acts [[knowingly]] with respect to a material element of an offense when:
##if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist; and
##if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.
#A person acts [[recklessness (law)|recklessly]] with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and intent of the actor's conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a [[reasonable person]] would observe in the actor's situation.
#A person acts [[negligence|negligently]] with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation.

(The above has been quoted [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] from the [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/18/00.003.002.000..HTM Pennsylvania Crimes Code]. That in turn derives from the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code, which is the basis for large portions of the criminal codes in most states. The only difference is that the MPC uses "purposely" instead of "intentionally".)

In short:
* A person  causes a result purposely if the result is his/her goal in doing the action that causes it,
* A person causes a result knowingly if he/she knows that the result is virtually certain to occur from the action he/she undertakes,
* A person causes a result recklessly if he/she is aware of and disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk of the result occurring from the action, and
* A person causes a result negligently if there is a substantial and unjustifiable risk he/she is unaware of but should be aware of.

The first two types of culpability are each a subset of the following. Thus if someone acts purposely, they also act knowingly. If someone acts knowingly, they also act recklessly.

The definitions of specific crimes refer to these degrees to establish the [[mens rea]] (mental state) necessary for a person to be guilty of a crime. The stricter the culpability requirements, the harder it is for the prosecution to prove its case.

For instance, the definition of first degree [[murder]] (again in PA) is "A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing." Thus to be guilty of murder in the first degree, one must have an explicit goal in one's mind to cause the death of another. On the other hand, [[reckless endangerment]] has a much broader requirement: "A person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree if he recklessly engages in conduct which places or may place another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury." Thus to be guilty of this one only needs to be aware of a substantial risk he is putting others in danger of; it does not have to be one's explicit goal to put people in risk. (But, if one's goal ''is'' to put others in substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, this is, of course, sufficient.)

There is one more type of culpability, and that is ''strict liability''. In [[strict liability]] crimes, the actor is responsible no matter what his mental state; if the result occurs, the actor is liable. An example is the [[felony murder]] rule: if the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that one commits a qualifying felony (see the article) during which death results, one is held strictly liable for murder and the prosecution does not have to prove any of the normal culpability requirements for murder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17454">{{Other uses|Experience (disambiguation)}}

'''Experience''' is the [[knowledge]] or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare various contemporary definitions given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] (2nd edition, 1989): "[...] 3. The actual [[observation]] of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...]  4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...]  b. In religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...]  6. What has been experienced; the events that have taken place within the knowledge of an individual, a community, mankind at large, either during a particular period or generally. [...]  7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired."
&lt;/ref&gt; Terms in [[philosophy]] such as "[[empirical knowledge]]" or "''a posteriori'' knowledge" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an [[expert]]. The concept of experience generally refers to [[know-how]] or [[procedural knowledge]], rather than [[propositional knowledge]]: [[on-the-job training]] rather than book-learning.

The interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy. Experience plays an important role in the [[philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard]]. The [[German language|German]] term ''[[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]]'', often translated into English as "experience", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of [[personal life|life]]'s experiences.

Certain [[religious]] [[traditions]] (such as [[Buddhism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[mysticism]] and [[Pentecostalism]]) and educational [[paradigms]] with, for example, the [[physical exercise|conditioning]] of military [[recruit training|recruit-training]] (also known as "boot camps"), stress the experiential nature of human [[epistemology]]. This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of [[dogma]], [[logic]] or [[reason]]ing. Participants in activities such as [[tourism]], [[extreme sports]] and [[recreational drug use|recreational drug-use]] also tend to stress the importance of experience.

The history of the word ''experience'' aligns it closely with the concept of [[experiment]].

== Types of experience ==
The word "experience" may refer, somewhat ambiguously, both to [[mind|mentally]] unprocessed immediately perceived events as well as to the purported [[wisdom]] gained in subsequent reflection on those events or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.

Some wisdom-experience accumulates over a period of [[time]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
though one can also experience (and gain general wisdom-experience from) a single specific momentary event.

One may also [[wikt:differentiate|differentiate]] between (for example) [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] and [[virtual reality|virtual]] experience(s).

&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, physical experiences relate to [[observable]]s. They need not involve [[modal property|modal properties]] nor [[Mind|mental experiences]].

=== Mental ===
{{Main|Mind}}

Mental experience involves the aspect of [[intellect]] and [[consciousness]] experienced as combinations of [[thought]], [[perception]], [[memory]], [[emotion]], [[free will|will]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and [[imagination]], including all unconscious [[cognitive]] processes. The term can refer, by implication, to a thought process. Mental experience and its relation to the physical brain form an area of philosophical debate: some identity theorists originally argued that the identity of brain and mental states held only for a few sensations. Most theorists, however, generalized the view to cover all mental experience.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematicians]] can exemplify cumulative mental experience in the approaches and skills with which they work. [[Mathematical realism]], like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover and experience it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. This point of view regards only one sort of mathematics as discoverable; it sees triangles, right angles, and curves, for example, as real entities, not just the creations of the human mind. Some working mathematicians have espoused mathematical realism as they see themselves experiencing naturally occurring objects. Examples include [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (for example: for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but some conjectures, like the [[continuum hypothesis]], might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology such as experience could provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture. With experience, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

=== Emotional ===
{{Main|Emotion}}

Humans can rationalize [[falling in love|falling in (and out) of love]] as "emotional experience". Societies which lack institutional arranged marriages can call on emotional experience in individuals to influence [[mate selection|mate-selection]].&lt;ref&gt;

People can likewise achieve such experiences more deliberately through recognized [[mystical practice]]s such as [[sensory deprivation]] or [[mind control|mind-control]] techniques, [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], or [[mystical discipline]]s such as [[mantra meditation]], [[yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[dream yoga]], or [[surat shabd yoga|surat shabda yoga]]. Some practices encourage [[spiritual experience]]s through the ingestion of [[psychoactive drug]]s such as alcohol and opiates, but more commonly with [[entheogen]]ic plants and substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[salvia divinorum]]'', [[psilocybin]] mushrooms, [[peyote]], [[Dextromethorphan|DXM]], [[ayahuasca]], or ''[[datura]]''. Another way to induce spiritual experience through an altered state of consciousness involves [[psychoacoustics]], [[binaural beats]], or light-and-sound stimulation.

[[Role-playing game]]s treat "experience" (and its acquisition) as an important, measurable, and valuable commodity. Many [[role-playing video game]]s, for instance, feature units of measurement used to quantify or assist a player-character's progression through the game - called [[experience point]]s or XP.

=== Subjective ===

Subjective experience can involve a state of [[individual]] [[subjectivity]], [[perception]] on which one builds one's own state of [[reality]]; a reality based on one’s [[interaction]] with one's environment. The ''subjective'' ''experience'' depends on one’s [[individual]] ability to process [[data]], to store and [[internalize]] it. For example: our senses collect data, which we then process according to [[biological]] programming (genetics), [[neurological]] network-relationships and other variables such as [[Cultural relativity|relativity]] etc.,{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} all of which affect our individual experience of any given situation in such a way as to render it subjective.

== Immediacy of experience ==

Someone able to recount an event they witnessed or took part in has "[[wikt:firsthand|first hand]] experience". First hand experience of the "you had to be there" variety can seem especially valuable and privileged, but it often remains potentially subject to errors in [[sense]]-[[perception]] and in personal [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].

[[Second hand|Second-hand]] experience can offer richer resources: recorded and/or summarised from first-hand observers or experiencers or from instruments, and potentially expressing multiple [[Perspective (cognitive)|points of view]].

Third-hand experience, based on indirect and possibly unreliable [[rumour]] or [[hearsay]], can (even given reliable accounts) potentially stray perilously close to blind honouring of [[authority]].

== Changes through history ==

Some [[post-modernism|post-modernist]]s suggest that the nature of human experiencing (quite apart from the details of the experienced surrounds) has undergone qualitative change during transition from the pre-modern through the [[modernity|modern]] to the [[post-modernity|post-modern]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Alternatives to experience ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] contrasted experience with [[reason]]:
:"Nothing, indeed, can be more harmful or more unworthy of the philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to so-called experience. Such experience would never have existed at all, if at the proper time, those institutions had been established in accordance with ideas."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These views of Kant are mirrored in the research of [[ideasthesia]], which demonstrates that one can experience the world only if one has the appropriate concepts (i.e., the ''ideas'') about the objects that are being experienced.

=== Writing ===
American author [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote an essay entitled "[[Experience (Emerson)|Experience]]" (published in 1844), in which he asks readers to disregard [[emotion]]s that could alienate them from the divine; it provides a somewhat [[pessimism|pessimistic]] representation of the [[transcendentalism]] associated with Emerson.

'''Francesco Maria Zanotti''' Cavazzoni (Bologna, 6 January 1692 &amp;ndash; Bologna, 25 December 1777) was an [[Italians|Italian]] philosopher and writer.&lt;ref name="Garin2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garin|first=Eugenio|authorlink=Eugenio Garin|title=History of Italian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVP3vBmDktQC&amp;pg=PA1260|accessdate=23 September 2012|year=2008|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-2321-5|pages=719–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides being a writer, he was also a commentator on works of art. He was considered an authoritative source on many topics.{{By whom|date=February 2012}}

==Life==
He was the son of [[Giampietro Zanotti]], and a pupil of [[Eustachio Manfredi]]. In 1718 he became professor of philosophy at the [[University of Bologna]], and in 1723 he was appointed as secretary of [[Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli]]. Initially a [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]], he became a follower of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].&lt;ref name="Garin2008"/&gt; In 1728 [[Francesco Algarotti]] experimented with light in his lab, replicating the [[Prism (optics)|prism]] and [[spectrum]] experiments of [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;"THE INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE OF BOLOGNA AND THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY"

Zanotti's 1741 essay on the 'attractive force of ideas' defended a view of the [[association of ideas]] influenced by [[Newtonian physics]]. In 1754 Zanotti criticised [[Pierre-Louis Maupertuis]] for his views on [[Stoicism]] and [[Christianity]], and was drawn into controversy about Stoicism with the Dominican professor [[Casto Innocente Ansaldi]].&lt;ref name="Garin2008"/&gt;

In 1766 he became president of Institute of Science in Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviostorico.unibo.it/template/detailImmagini.asp?IDFolder=324&amp;IDOggetto=95296&amp;mCO=ucmPhhfuuj%2FJoufsp2!BTD&amp;mCW=&amp;mCJ=&amp;LN=IT His portrait can be seen here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)]] began a correspondence with Zanotti on [[phosphor]].&lt;ref&gt;"THE INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE OF BOLOGNA AND THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY"

'''Francis Saviour Farrugia''' (18th century) was a minor Maltese philosopher, [[doctor of law]], and legislator. He specialised in [[jurisprudence]] (the [[philosophy of law]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Unfortunately it is yet not known in what year Farrugia was born or died. Nor from which town or city in Malta he hailed.

As an academic and intellectual, Farrugia was held in very high regard by his peers. This was particularly so with the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], who had full confidence in his erudition and expertise.

At some time or other, Farrugia was a judge in the courts of appeal, a magistrate at the (''Clistania'') prisons, a magistrate of arms, a Councillor of the Supreme Tribunal for Justice, and assessor of the Maritime Consulate. These offices attest to the esteem he enjoyed and the favour with which he was bestowed by the government of the [[Knights Hospitallers]].

Undoubtedly, Farrugia was a staunch traditionalist. This may be clearly seen in his only extant philosophical work, ''Discorsi Accademici'' (1775), in which, amongst other matters, he justifies and defends the use of torture, in the investigative and compilatory phase of a judicial case as much as a penalty. Though he seems to have taken note of the advances made in jurisprudence – especially that by [[Cesare Beccaria]] in his 1764 work ''On Crimes and Punishment'' – Farrugia evidently did not agree with them. Not so [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], who, in 1784, was one of the first European princes to abolish the penalty of torture.

==Works==
* 1775 – ''Ragguaglio della Gloriosa Esaltazione al Gran Magistro di S.A.Sma. Fra Don Emmanuele De Rohan'' (Report on the Elevation to Grand Master of H.R.H. Bro. Emmanuel De Rohan).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; The work is a diary of events which led to the election of [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]] to the office of [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitallers]]. Though interesting in itself, it has no philosophical value.
* 1778 – '''''Discorsi Accademici''''' (Academic Discussions).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Written in Italian and published at the printing press of the [[Knights Hospitallers]] in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], the book is made up of thirty-nine pages, and dedicated to [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]]. It is divided into six parts, each discussing different philosophical themes, namely: (1) education, (2) law, (3) keeping the populace at peace and seeking its goodwill, (4) the success of a ruler, (5) just deserts and the use of torture, and (6) reward.

: Basically, the work is a short treatise on the philosophy of punishment. Structurally, the fifth part is the main section of the book, around which all the other parts are organised. In this part Farrugia makes a strong appeal so that retribution be held as a rule of law, for, he states, it is after all the true spirit of the law. This leads him to justify torture. He did not deem torture to imply any philosophical contradiction. On the contrary. Though he considers the philosophical positions of those whom he calls ‘humanitarians’, Farrugia refutes them on the grounds of the retributive arguments which he expounds throughout the rest of his book.

'''Free Beer''', originally known as '''Vores øl - An [[open source]] beer''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] for: ''Our Beer''), is the first brand of [[beer]] with an "[[Open source|open]]"/"free" [[brand]] and [[Cooking recipe|recipe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050104084130/http://www.copcap.com/composite-8636.htm Danish students launch open source and shareware beer 30-12-2004] on copcap.com (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; The recipe and [[trademark]] elements are published under the [[Creative Commons]] [[CC BY-SA]] [[Creative Commons license|license]].&lt;ref name="license"&gt;[http://freebeer.org/blog/faq FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802003325/http://freebeer.org/blog/faq |date=2015-08-02 }} ''"How can a beer be “free”? The recipe and the FREE BEER brand is published under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license"'' on freebeer.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The beer was created in 2004 by students at the [[IT University of Copenhagen|IT University]] in [[Copenhagen]] together with [[artist collective]] [[Superflex]], to illustrate how concepts of the [[Free open source software|FOSS]] movement might be applied outside the digital world. The "Free Beer" concept illustrates also the connection between the long tradition of freely sharing [[cooking recipe]]s with the [[Free open source software|FOSS]] movement, which tries to establish this sharing tradition also for the "recipes" of software, the [[source code]]. The "Free beer" concept received an overall positive reception from international press and media for the political message,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; was presented on many [[exhibition]]s and [[Academic conference|conference]]s, and inspired many breweries in adopting the concept.

==History==

=== Vores Øl ===
In December 2004 a group of [[IT University of Copenhagen]] students together with [[Superflex]] brewed a 100-liter batch of a dark heavy beer in their school's [[cafeteria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/henrikmoltke/143078944/in/pool-freebeer/ Henrik Moltke's flicker stream] ''"Students at IT University, Copenhagen, Superflex and the Yoda of home brewing, Kjeld Erlandsen, making the first batch of Vores Øl (our beer), the predecessor of FREE BEER"'' (December 13, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The group labeled the beer ''Vores øl'' ([[Danish language|Danish]] for: ''Our Beer''), after a 1994 [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] beer advertisement slogan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070805105531/http://www.drf.dk/page.php?pk_content=64#1994#1994 Vinderlisten - Arnold 1994] "IdéPrisen Arnold, Produkt/titel: Vores Øl "Kollektivet", Annoncør: Carlsberg Bryggerierne" (archived, Danish)&lt;/ref&gt; A website was created to promote the project and the beer's recipe and label designs were published under an [[open source]] [[Creative Commons]] [[Public copyright license|license]], specifically the [[CC-BY-SA]] 2.5 license.&lt;ref name="license"/&gt; Unlike software, cooking recipes aren't [[copyright]]able, so the [[share-alike]]/[[copyleft]] licensing approach is legally questionable and untested in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/what_if_copyright_didnt_apply_binary_executables |title=What if copyright didn't apply to binary executables? |date=2008-08-29| first=Terry |last=Hancock |publisher=[[Free Software Magazine]] |accessdate=2016-01-25 |quote="In fact, it's very likely that a recipe, which is usually quite minimal in expression, will not be subject to copyright protection at all, simply because there is so little "expressive" content. Instead, the major content of a recipe is said to be "functional": conveying only that information which is strictly necessary to communicate the composition of the stew."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the publication the project received an overall positive reception from international press and media for the political message.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4718719.stm 'Free' Danish beer makes a splash] on [[BBC]] News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/technology/13sources.html?ex=1122868800&amp;en=3836fcd017eecaae&amp;ei=5070&amp;ex=1122868800&amp;en=3836fcd017eecaae Pass Over a Frosty Mug of Home Brew Version 1.0] in [[The New York Times]] (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,68144,00.html?tw=wn_1culthead "Free Beer for Geeks"] on [[Wired (website)|Wired]] News by David Cohn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzkultur/0,1518,365818,00.html Kopenhagen: Studenten brauen Open-Source-Bier] in [[Spiegel Online]] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concept extension "Free Beer" ===
The developers of the beer stated that the beer was primarily a medium for the message of ''"dogmatic notions of [[copyright]] and [[intellectual property]] that are dominating our culture"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/asithappens/features/2005/open_source_beer_20050721.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423230451/http://www.cbc.ca/asithappens/features/2005/open_source_beer_20050721.html |title=Danish offer a recipe for open source beer|work=CBC Radio – As It Happens – Features |date=2005-07-21 |archivedate=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2015-06-26 |author=Adrian Harewood |publisher=[[CBC Radio One]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admitted that the group had only limited experience in beer production and was not made up of beer gurus.
The addition of the non-traditional beer ingredient [[Guaraná]] was also partly inspired politically by a previously in 2003 initiated Superflex project, "Guaraná Power",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superflex.net/tools/guarana_power "Guaraná Power"] on superflex.net ''"In 2003, SUPERFLEX initiated a collaboration with a guaraná farmers' cooperative from Maués in the Brazilian Amazon in order to produce the Guaraná Power soft drink. The farmers have organised themselves."''&lt;/ref&gt; which focussed on the support of [[Brazil]]ian guaraná farmers with [[Fair trade]].

After the first "Vores Øl" brewing of the open-source beer concept, Superflex continued to develop the concept under the name "Free Beer". A new colorful, unusual "Free Beer" artwork should create associations with the ''"60's [artistic] liberation"'' and underline the freedom aspect of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmuskoch.com/project/detail/0240_045/jInSD69996/ |title=Free Beer |first=Rasmus |last=Koch |quote=''FREE BEER refers to information freedom, not economic freedom. [...] Designing a visual program for an idea which reflects upon open source and information freedom can not be a solution with rigid design guidelines. Other models of interpretation had to be exercised. The resulting solution builds on a vivid and colorful reference to 60's liberation. Practically speaking this means "free the colours". No one color has the ability to rule or over set another. Only one spectral rule governs: NEVER USE ONE COLOR TWICE.'' |publisher=Rasmus Koch Studio |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later name "Free Beer" is a play on [[Richard Stallman]]'s common remark that free software is "[[Gratis versus libre|free as in speech, not free as in beer]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html The Free Software Definition - Free Software Foundation] on FSF.org&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested also the creation of "[[Free software]] beer" instead of an "[[open source]] beer".&lt;ref name="stallmanfreebeer"&gt;[http://superflex.net/texts/richard_stallman_on_free_beer Richard Stallman on free beer] on superflex.net „''HM: Now, in the same email, you also suggest that we call the beer a free software beer instead of an open source beer-  RMS: Yes, I founded the free software movement [...] HM: - so if you could pretend that you were reviewing the idea of a free beer?  RMS: I love the idea as long as I don’t have to drink it''“ (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recipe development ===
While the first "Vores øl" recipe draw some technical criticism, the recipe was continuously updated and identified shortcomings got fixed. Originally, the [[homebrewing]] community complaint the quality of the process and ingredient description.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/25/0524239 Free Beer That's Free as in Speech] on [[Slashdot]]&lt;/ref&gt; Remarks were that it was not stated how much water to use in the [[Mash (beer)|mash]], what type of [[yeast]] was to be used, the style of beer being produced (other than being dark and heavy), whether or not any [[Humulus lupulus|hop]]s were being added for aroma, [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] temperature, or how the beer was supposed to taste. Making reference to the technical problems of when software instructions ("[[source code]]") cannot be made into a functioning program, it was mentioned that if this recipe were source code, it would not [[Compiler|compile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=156902&amp;cid=13154412 ''If this recipe were code, it wouldn't compile. You'd have to guess at the yeast type and boil times for the hops.''] by Vellmont on [[slashdot.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the underlying theme of the group's message, the correction and development of this recipe is actively encouraged (in software terminology "[[Hotfix|bug fixing]] and [[Patch (software)|patches]]").

Due to the availability of the recipe and the many Free Beer brewings of breweries and individuals worldwide over the course of years, the recipe was updated several times. Later major Free Beer recipe iterations (v3.0 and 4.0) were also developed in collaboration with a local Danish and experienced [[brewery]], Skands in [[Brøndby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freebeer.org/blog/archives/36 Photos of FREE BEER 3.0 at final production stage] on freebeer.org "Master brewer Birthe Skands describes 3.0 as a ”traditional, top fermented beer with a very high drinkability factor" (Friday, June 9, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freebeer.org/blog/archives/154 FREE BEER VERSION 4.0] on freebeer.org (Thursday, October 8, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; As previous recipe shortcomings were corrected, for instance the amount of sugar was decreased by 90%, the quality of the beer improved significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FREE BEER recipe|url=http://www.freebeer.org/blog/recipe/ |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recipe's version, which has now reached 6.0 in 2017, illustrates the community's continuous collaborative improvement progress, made possible by the "open source" nature of Free Beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freebeer.org/blog/archives/157 "Free as in free speech" - LA Release for SUPERFLEX’s FREE BEER] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626232613/http://freebeer.org/blog/archives/157 |date=2015-06-26 }} Monday, August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derived beers ==
Under its free license, this free beer encourages others to tweak the recipe and redistribute it. Commercial or amateur brewers are able to reuse the recipe. Known derivatives include:
* Switzerland/[[Lausanne]]: ''Le Baiser de la Princesse'' (French for: "The Kiss of the Princess"), in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://free-tools.fr/inclassable/free-beer-et-le-baiser-de-la-princesse-les-bieres-open-source-474/ Free beer et le baiser de la princesse les bieres open source] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080517155646/http://baiserdelaprincesse.com/ baiserdelaprincesse.com] (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and impact==
Since its first presentation, the "Free Beer" concept was often reported by international printed and online media,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt; and also discussed in specialist books regarding copyright.&lt;ref name="Mcmillan2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=F-T-MMoRpn4C&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;ots=yNXu-oQuIA&amp;dq=free%20beer%20licensing%20of%20recipes&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q=free%20beer%20licensing%20of%20recipes&amp;f=false |title=New Directions in Copyright Law, Volume 6 |first=Fiona |last=Macmillan |pages=69–70 |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |date=2007 |accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Free Beer" project was also well received by the [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]] and [[open content]] movement, for instance by [[Richard Stallman]],&lt;ref name="stallmanfreebeer"/&gt; [[Cory Doctorow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2006/06/09/danish-hackers-launc.html Danish hackers launch Free Beer 3.0, with guarana] by [[Cory Doctorow]] on [[boingboing.net]] (Jun 9, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doctorow1"&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/18648900/in/pool-freebeer/ Cory Doctorow with freebeer] on flickr (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lawrence Lessig]].&lt;ref name="Lessig2"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lessig |first=Lawrence |authorlink=Lawrence Lessig |url=http://www.lessig.org/2008/08/how-much-rms-has-won |title=How much RMS has won |accessdate=2015-07-08 |date=2008-08-04 |publisher=lessig.org |quote=''Just returning from the iCommons Summit in Sapporo, Japan.

Free Beer was shown also in the context of several [[art exhibition]]s and [[museums]], for instance the [[Art Basel Miami Beach]] 2006, the [[Van Abbemuseum]], [[Netherlands]] 2007 or the [[Taipei Fine Arts Museum|Taipei Biennial]] 2010 (sponsored by [[Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation|TTL]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://tfam.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=1060250&amp;CtNode=27786&amp;mp=119012 2010] [[Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation|Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp.]] 5000 Bottles of “Free Beer Taiwan” in Taipei Biennial 2010&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="TP10"/&gt; "Free Beer" was also used in the context of [[anti-copyright]] activities and movements, illustrating the advantage of [[open knowledge]] for the society.

A '''free union''' is a romantic [[Intimate relationship|union]] between two or more persons without legal or religious recognition or regulation.

The term has been used since the late 19th century to describe a relationship into which all parties enter, remain, and depart freely.  The free union is an alternative to, or rejection or [[criticism of marriage]], viewing it as a form of [[slavery]] and human ownership, particularly for women.  According to this concept, the free union of adults is a legitimate relationship that should be respected. A free union is made between two individuals, but each individual may have several unions of their own.

==History==
Much of the contemporary tradition of free union under [[natural law]] or [[common law]] comes from [[Anarchism and issues related to love and sex#Free love and anarchism|anarchist rejection of marriage]], seeking non-interference of either church or state in human relations.

Leaving behind what was seen as law imposed by man in favor of [[natural law]] began during the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when many sought to rethink the laws of property, family, and the status of women. [[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858), who decried marriage as principally linked to the principle of ownership, offers a foretaste of the free union by use of the term "marriage contract in front of nature."  Philosopher and [[feminism|feminist]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) stated, "Marriage is an affirmation of the supremacy of man over woman [...] if I love a man, I want to love him while keeping my freedom."  In the 1882, [[Élisée Reclus]] initiated the [[Marriage#Contemporary legal and human rights criticisms of marriage|Anti-Marriage Movement]], in accordance with which he and his partner allowed their two daughters to marry without any civil or religious ceremony, despite public and legal condemnation. Reclus had four partners throughout his lifetime, each with a different social contract.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chardak |first=Henriette  |date=2006 |title=Reclus: an infernal encyclopaedist! |publisher=L'Harmattan, page 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more modern times, free unions were common among members of the Spanish anarchist [[Confederación_Nacional_del_Trabajo|CNT]] political party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E59fMpt1pUA |title=The Spanish Civil War Documentary 2/6 |publisher=BBC |date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the popular revolution that ran alongside the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="To Remember Spain"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/bookchin/sp001642/toc.html |title=To Remember Spain |author=Murray Bookchin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple desiring contractual validation of their relationship would simple go to the Party Headquarters and request the forms, which would be destroyed if the relationship were to not work out. The couple however, were strongly encouraged to make it work, as separation created administrative work for the party.

Additionally, many leading 20th Century intellectuals, including [[James Joyce]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and their partners, and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] never chose to marry, or delayed it until the end of life for legal reasons. De Beauvoir said of the institution, "When we abolish the slavery of half of humanity, together with the whole system of hypocrisy that it implies, then the 'division' of humanity will reveal its genuine significance and the human couple will find its true form."

==Contemporary law==
In French law, the ''union libre'' is an agreement between adults which grants rights between parents and potential children, but holds no obligation of sexual fidelity, nor does it grant reciprocal duties and rights between partners.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite book |last=Legros |first=Dominique |date=2013 |title=Mainstream Polygamy: The Non-Marital Child Paradox In The West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b_S8BAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;ots=w13uijDVqX&amp;dq=free%20union%20relationship&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=free%20union%20relationship&amp;f=false |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A free union can be between individuals of any gender, and an individual may have several concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Droit civil ; la famille |author=Dominique Fenouillet and Francois Terre |date=2011 |url=http://www.librairiedalloz.fr/9782247106738-droit-civil-la-famille-8e-edition-dominique-fenouillet-francois-terre/}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore making free union an option for [[LGBTQ]] or [[polyamory|polyamorous]] relationships, as well as heterosexual and/or monogamous ones that do not wish to enter the contract of marriage for historical, social, or financial reasons.

United States law has no exact legal equivalent of a free union, although comparisons are often made to [[common law marriage]].  In the United States, partners wishing to have legal rights without entering into a marriage contract may choose to complete documents such as a [[healthcare proxy]], [[domestic partnership]] agreement, [[will and testament|will]], and [[power of attorney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unmarried.org/cohabitation/legal-financial/faq/ |title=Living Together: Legal &amp; Financial F.A.Q. |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013 |website=Unmarried Equality |publisher= |access-date=2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of a free union may refer to each other as partners, spouses, or any other title, but may find themselves subject to the laws of common law marriage if they consistently refer to themselves as husband and wife according to their local jurisdiction.

==Roman Catholic criticism==
According to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], the expression "free union" includes situations such as [[concubinage]], rejection of marriage as such, or inability to make long-term commitments.&lt;ref name="CC2390"&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#2390 ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 2390]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], being in a "free union" is a grave offense against the dignity of [[Marriage (Catholic Church)|marriage]],&lt;ref name="CC2400"&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a6.htm#2400 ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 2400]&lt;/ref&gt; which it sees as a [[Sacrament]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sacrament of Marriage". ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. [www.newadvent.org/cathen/09707a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents maintain that the free union acts as a public recognition of a relationship without the obligations of church or state.

'''Friedrich Heinrich Feuerbach''' (29 September 1806 – 24 January 1880) was a German philologist and philosopher. In the 1840s he played an important role disseminating materialist and atheist philosophy.

==Life==
Friedrich Feuerbach was born on 29 September 1806 in Munich. He was the youngest son of the distinguished jurist [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach]] (1775–1833) and uncle of painter [[Anselm Feuerbach]] (1829–1880). His older brothers were all distinguished scholars.&lt;ref&gt;
*Joseph Anselm Feuerbach (1798–1851), father of the painter, was a philologist and archeologist;
*[[Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach]] (1800–1834) was a noted mathematician;
*Eduard August Feuerbach (1803–1843) was a scholar of jurisprudence;
*[[Ludwig Feuerbach|Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]] (1804–1872) was a philosopher and anthropologist who influenced [[Karl Marx]].
Friedrich also had three sisters: Rebekka Magdalena "Helene" Feuerbach von Dobeneck (1808–1891), Leonore Feuerbach (1809–1885), Elise Feuerbach (1813–1883).

Cf. ''Meyers Konversations-Lexikon.'' 4th edition, vol. 6, Bibliographisches Institut, Leipzig, 1885–1892. 
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826 he began his studies at the university of Erlangen. At first he studied theology, then history and finally philology and philosophy, specializing in Sanskrit literature. His supervisor was [[Friedrich Rückert]]. At Erlangen he was a member of a liberal nationalist student fraternity. In 1831, shortly after graduating, he went to Paris to work with the noted philologists and linguists [[Antoine-Léonard de Chézy|Chézy]], Bournouf and Remusat. France had recently experienced the [[July Revolution]], and Friedrich met with some of the French utopian socialists of the time (e.g., [[Pierre Leroux]]). He also seems to have travelled to Switzerland, where he met the radical followers of [[Wilhelm Weitling]]; some of them subsequently studied his writings on religion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Marr seems to have been the conduit; in the 1840s he helped publish Friedrich Feuerbach's writings on religion in Switzerland. Marr was the author of ''Das junge Deutschland in der Schweiz. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der geheimen Verbindungen unserer Tage''. Leipzig, 1846. (''Young Germany in Switzerland: A Contribution to the History of the Secret Societies of Our Days.'') To Ludwig Feuerbach's chagrin, conservative newspapers connected the Feuerbach brothers with the 'unmeasured revolutionism' of these circles. Cf: Schuffenhauer, W., Introduction to: 'Ludwig Feuerbach stellt des Bruders Schrift ''Gedanken und Thatsachen'', 1862, vor.' Berlin, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence, however, that Friedrich Feuerbach himself ever participated in any revolutionary association (nor would this have been in character with his diffident nature).

On his return to Germany Feuerbach did not seek a profession but instead took rented rooms in Nuremberg and lived on a small state pension. He lived that way for most of his life. Friedrich Feuerbach published several translations from Sanskrit, Spanish, Italian and French. In the 1830s he was associated with the [[Young Germany|Young German]] movement in literature; in the early 1840s he contributed to a number of [[Young Hegelians|Young Hegelian]] magazines. Friedrich Freuerbach is described as extremely shy and withdrawn. His brother Ludwig described him as utterly undemanding. The suicide attempt of his older brother [[Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach|Karl]], the mathematician, who had been arrested for belonging to a liberal student fraternity in 1824, seems to have greatly affected Friedrich. He was with Karl during his battle with mental illness and when he died prematurely in 1834. The physician Dr. Theodor Spoerri, a family friend, thought he suffered from "heaviness of the blood" (depression). He also thought that the "genius" of the talented Feuerbach family was most concentrated in Friedrich, the least-known brother.&lt;ref&gt;Spoerri, Th., ''Genie und Krankheit.'' Basel/New York, 1851, pp. 73 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Georg Friedrich Daumer was one of his few occasional visitors. The liberal theologian Johann Heinrich Wichern also acknowledged his influence.

Friedrich Feuerbach was a qualified Orientalist with several publications. However, under the influence of his brother [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Ludwig]], he turned to philosophy. He expounded a critique of religion that was heavily indebted to his brother's. He professed "to preach what he taught."&lt;ref&gt;''Meyers... op. cit.'', p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich often actively assisted Ludwig in editing his manuscripts. In spite of his atheism, Friedrich seems to have sympathized with a local liberal Protestant 'free faith' group. He died in Nuremberg on 24 January 1880.

==Views==
Friedrich Feuerbach shared his brother Ludwig's [[materialism|materialistic]] [[humanism]]. However, he focused less on his brother's theories of the origin of religious [[Social alienation|alienation]] and more on the practical implications of religion. Religion requires of the believer "a perpetual sacrifice of his autonomous thinking."&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Feuerbach, F., ''Die Religion der Zukunft.'' Zurich, 1843, pp. 2-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire for happiness is the most powerful human drive, but it can be fulfilled only if (a) human beings know their essential nature (''Wesen'') and (b) they love it. Christianity interferes with the first by replacing science with superstition; it hinders the second by portraying human beings as hopelessly weak and dependent on the will of an almighty God.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', p. 7 ff. ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the task of the State, through education and enlightened laws, to provide the material conditions of happiness. To do this, the State must emancipate itself from the influence of the Church. Although Church and State seem symbiotic, the priesthood merely a spiritual police force to complement the secular, in essence Church and State are in conflict: The essence and instrument of the State is the law, but the Church demands of believers obedience to the absolute will of God. As law is in conflict with arbitrary will, so the role of citizen is in conflict with that of believer. So the State must become secular, although Feuerbach acknowledges it will be difficult to remove religion from the minds of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Cp. ''op. cit.'', pp. 33-38 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; The means to social reform is through education. Friedrich Feuebach's political ideal may be described as a kind of [[utopian socialism]]: a benevolent secular State that provides people with a scientific education, organises conditions of life rationally and encourages mutual love and assistance.&lt;ref&gt;"If love of humanity is understood as a personal and emotional sympathy with all human beings, then no one can be obligated to it. Personal sympathy cannot be commanded at all, and can always only relate to a few. Love of humanity, taken rationally, which can indeed be made a duty for everyone, means as much as: recognition of the universal human rights of each and recognition of the claims of each on me, and according to my powers and means to further him in all that is socially lawful [landesgesetzlich erlaubt]. … The main point is that the individual thinks and works not only for himself but also for others; it matters less whether he lives ''among'' men but rather, that he lives ''for'' them." Feuerbach, F., ''Gedanken und Tatsachen. Ein Beitrag zur Verständigung über die wichtigsten Bedingungen des Menschenwohles'' Tr. V.I. Chastra. Hamburg, 1862, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Friedrich Feurbach humbly thought of himself as a mere disseminator of his brother Ludwig's ideas, there were differences between them. Ludwig's distinctive analysis of the concept of God as alienated 'species being' played little role in Friedrich's writings; Friedrich focused on the nefarious implications of God as absolute arbitrary willpower. The note of social radicalism of the professed 'communist' Ludwig was largely absent from Friedrich, who never clarified whether the secular state he envisioned presiding over a society based on mutual aid, could be established by the existing government by enlightened reform from above, or required a more radical change of system. Another difference concerns the role Friedrich Feuerbach assigns to the secular State in establishing conditions of universal happiness and enlightenment about religion; Ludwig Feuerbach places much less emphasis on the state and seems rather more hostile to it.&lt;ref&gt;In general, Ludwig seems more influenced by the anarchistic streak in Young Hegelian thought, as seen in Stirner, Bakunin and the Marx of ''Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right'' (1843).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈʃlaɪɐˌmaχɐ|lang}}; November 21, 1768&amp;nbsp;– February 12, 1834) was a German [[theology|theologian]], [[philosopher]], and [[biblical scholar]] known for his attempt to reconcile the criticisms of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with traditional [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]]. He also became influential in the evolution of [[higher criticism]], and his work forms part of the foundation of the modern field of [[hermeneutics]].  Because of his profound effect on subsequent Christian thought, he is often called the "Father of Modern [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal Theology]]" and is considered an early leader in [[liberal Christianity]]. The [[neo-orthodoxy]] movement of the twentieth century, typically (though not without challenge) seen to be spearheaded by [[Karl Barth]], was in many ways an attempt to challenge his influence.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and development ===
Born in [[Wrocław|Breslau]] in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Silesia]] as the grandson of Daniel Schleiermacher, a pastor at one time associated with the [[Zionites (Germany)|Zionites]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/bce/mwt_themes_470_schleiermacher.htm Boston Collaborative Encyclopedia of Western Theology: Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher (1768–1834)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913| url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15761a.htm | title = Zionites | accessdate = 18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the son of Gottlieb Schleiermacher, a [[Reformed Church]] chaplain in the Prussian army, Schleiermacher started his formal education in a [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] school at [[Niesky]] in [[Upper Lusatia]], and at [[Barby, Germany|Barby]] near [[Magdeburg]]. However, [[Pietism|pietistic]] Moravian theology failed to satisfy his increasing doubts, and his father reluctantly gave him permission to enter the [[University of Halle]], which had already abandoned pietism and adopted the [[rationalism|rationalist]] spirit of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and [[Johann Salomo Semler]]. As a [[theology]] student Schleiermacher pursued an independent course of reading and neglected the study of the [[Old Testament]] and of [[Oriental languages]]. However, he did attend the lectures of Semler, where he became acquainted with the techniques of [[historical criticism]] of the [[New Testament]], and of [[Johann Augustus Eberhard]], from whom he acquired a love of the [[philosophies|philosophy]] of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. At the same time he studied the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]], and began to apply ideas from the Greek philosophers to a reconstruction of Kant's system.

Schleiermacher developed a deep-rooted skepticism as a student, and soon he rejected orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. G. Haykin, Liberal Protestantism, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Gerrish, a scholar of the works of Schleiermacher, writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a letter to his father, Schleiermacher drops the mild hint that his teachers fail to deal with those widespread doubts that trouble so many young people of the present day. His father misses the hint. He has himself read some of the skeptical literature, he says, and can assure Schleiermacher that it is not worth wasting time on. For six whole months there is no further word from his son. Then comes the bombshell. In a moving letter of 21 January 1787, Schleiermacher admits that the doubts alluded to are his own. His father has said that faith is the "regalia of the Godhead," that is, God's royal due.&lt;ref name="A. Gerrish 1984"&gt;
B. A. Gerrish, ''A Prince of the Church: Schleiermacher and the Beginnings of Modern Theology'' (Philadelphia, PA: Fortress Press, 1984), p. 25.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schleiermacher confessed:  "Faith is the regalia of the Godhead, you say. Alas! dearest father, if you believe that without this faith no one can attain to salvation in the next world, nor to tranquility in this — and such, I know, is your belief — oh! then pray to God to grant it to me, for to me it is now lost. I cannot believe that he who called himself the Son of Man was the true, eternal God; I cannot believe that his death was a vicarious atonement."&lt;ref name="A. Gerrish 1984"/&gt;

=== Tutoring, chaplaincy, first works ===
[[File:Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|An engraving of Schleiermacher from his early adulthood.]]
At the completion of his course at Halle, Schleiermacher became the private tutor to the family of Friedrich Alexander Burggraf und Graf zu [[Dohna-Schlobitten]] (1741–1810), developing in a cultivated and aristocratic household his deep love of family and social life. Two years later, in 1796, he became chaplain to the [[Charité]] Hospital in Berlin. Lacking scope for the development of his preaching skills, he sought mental and spiritual satisfaction in the city's cultivated society and in intensive philosophical studies, beginning to construct the framework of his philosophical and religious system. Here  Schleiermacher became acquainted with art, literature, science and general culture. He was strongly influenced by [[German Romanticism]], as represented by his friend [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel]]. This interest is borne out by his ''Confidential Letters on Schlegel's Lucinde'', as well as by his seven-year relationship (1798–1805) with [[Eleonore Christiane Grunow]] (née Krüger) (1769/1770–1837), wife of Berlin clergyman August Christian Wilhelm Grunow (1764–1831).

Though his ultimate principles remained unchanged, he placed more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Meanwhile, he studied [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Plato]], both of whom were important influences. He became more indebted to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], though they differed on fundamental points. He sympathised with some of Jacobi's positions, and took some ideas from [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]. The literary product of this period of rapid development was his influential book, ''Reden über die Religion'' ([[On Religion|''On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers'']]) and his "new year's gift" to the new century, the ''Monologen'' (''Soliloquies'').

In the first book Schleiermacher gave religion an unchanging place among the divine mysteries of human nature, distinguished it from what he regarded as current caricatures of religion, and described the perennial forms of its manifestation. This established the programme of his subsequent theological system. In the ''Monologen'' he revealed his ethical manifesto, in which he proclaimed his ideas on the freedom and independence of the spirit, and on the relationship of the mind to the sensual world, and sketched his ideal of the future of the individual and of society.

=== Pastorship ===
From 1802 to 1804, Schleiermacher served as a pastor in the [[Province of Pomerania (1653–1815)|Pomeranian]] town of [[Słupsk|Stolp]]. He relieved Friedrich Schlegel entirely of his nominal responsibility for the translation of Plato, which they had together undertaken (vols. 1–5, 1804–1810; vol. 6, Repub. 1828). Another work, ''Grundlinien einer Kritik der bisherigen Sittenlehre'' [Outlines of a Critique of the Doctrines of Morality to date] (1803), the first of his strictly critical and philosophical productions, occupied him; it is a criticism of all previous moral systems, including those of Kant and Fichte — Plato's and Spinoza's find most favour. It contends that the tests of the soundness of a moral system are the completeness of its view of the laws and ends of human life as a whole and the harmonious arrangement of its subject-matter under one fundamental principle. Although it is almost exclusively critical and negative, the book announces Schleiermacher's later view of moral science, attaching prime importance to a ''Güterlehre'', or doctrine of the ends to be obtained by moral action. The obscurity of the book's style and its negative tone prevented immediate success.

=== Professorship ===
In 1804, Schleiermacher moved as university preacher and professor of [[theology]] to the [[University of Halle]], where he remained until 1807, quickly obtaining a reputation as professor and preacher; he exercised a powerful influence in spite of contradictory charges which accused him of atheism, Spinozism and pietism. In this period, he began his lectures on hermeneutics (1805–1833) and he also wrote his dialogue the ''Weihnachtsfeier'' (''Christmas Eve: Dialogue on the Incarnation'', 1806), which represents a midway point between his ''Speeches'' and his great dogmatic work, ''Der christliche Glaube'' (''The Christian Faith''); the speeches represent phases of his growing appreciation of Christianity as well as the conflicting elements of the theology of the period. After the [[Battle of Jena]] he returned to Berlin (1807), was soon appointed pastor of the [[Holy Trinity Church (Berlin)|Trinity Church]], and on May 18, 1809 he married Henriette von Willich (née von Mühlenfels) (1788–1840), the widow of his friend Johann Ehrenfried Theodor von Willich (1777–1807).

At the foundation of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (1810), in which he took a prominent part, Schleiermacher obtained a theological chair, and soon became secretary to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. He took a prominent part in the reorganization of the Prussian church, and became the most powerful advocate of the union of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and Reformed divisions of German Protestantism, paving the way for the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Union]] of Churches (1817). The twenty-four years of his professional career in Berlin began with his short outline of theological study (''Kurze Darstellung des theologischen Studiums'', 1811), in which he sought to do for theology what he had done for religion in his ''Speeches''.

While he preached every Sunday, Schleiermacher also gradually took up in his lectures in the university almost every branch of theology and philosophy—[[New Testament]] exegesis, introduction to and interpretation of the New Testament, [[ethics]] (both philosophic and Christian), [[dogma]]tic and practical theology, church history, history of philosophy, [[psychology]], [[dialectics]] ([[logic]] and [[metaphysics]]), [[politics]], [[pedagogy]], [[translation]] and [[aesthetics]].

In politics Schleiermacher supported liberty and progress, and in the period of reaction which followed the overthrow of [[Napoleon]] he was charged by the Prussian government with "demagogic agitation" in conjunction with the patriot [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]].

At the same time Schleiermacher prepared his chief theological work ''Der christliche Glaube nach den Grundsätzen der evangelischen Kirche'' (1821–1822; 2nd ed., greatly altered, 1830–1831; 6th ed., 1884). The fundamental principle is that religious feeling, the sense of absolute dependence on God as communicated by [[Jesus]] through the church, and not the creeds or the letter of Scripture or the rationalistic understanding, is the source and basis of dogmatic theology. The work is therefore simply a description of the facts of religious feeling, or of the inner life of the soul in its relations to God, and these inward facts are looked at in the various stages of their development and presented in their systematic connection. The aim of the work was to reform Protestant theology, to put an end to the unreason and superficiality of both supernaturalism and rationalism, and to deliver [[religion]] and [[theology]] from dependence on perpetually changing systems of [[philosophy]].

Though the work added to the reputation of its author, it aroused the increased opposition of the theological schools it was intended to overthrow, and at the same time Schleiermacher's defence of the right of the church to frame its own liturgy in opposition to the arbitrary dictation of the monarch or his ministers brought him fresh troubles. He felt isolated, although his church and his lecture-room continued to be crowded.

Schleiermacher continued with his translation of Plato and prepared a new and greatly altered edition of his ''Christlicher Glaube'', anticipating the latter in two letters to his friend [[Gottfried Christian Friedrich Lücke|Gottfried Lücke]] (in the ''Studien und Kritiken'', 1829), in which he defended his theological position generally and his book in particular against opponents on the right and the left.

The same year Schleiermacher lost his only son—Nathaniel (1820–1829)—a blow which, he said, "drove the nails into his own coffin." But he continued to defend his theological position against [[Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg|Hengstenberg's]] party on the one hand and the rationalists Daniel Georg Konrad von Cölln (1788–1833) and David Schulz (1779–1854) on the other, protesting against both subscription to the ancient creeds and the imposition of a new rationalistic formulary.

== Work ==

=== Doctrine of knowledge ===
Schleiermacher's [[psychology]] takes as its basis the phenomenal dualism of the ego and the non-ego, and regards the life of man as the interaction of these elements with their interpenetration as its infinite destination. The [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] is therefore not absolute, and, though present in man's own constitution as composed of body and soul, is relative only even there. The ego is itself both body and soul — the conjunction of both constitutes it. Our "organization" or sense nature has its intellectual element, and our "intellect" its organic element, and there is no such thing as "pure mind" or "pure body." The one general function of the ego, thought, becomes in relation to the non-ego either receptive or spontaneous action, and in both forms of action its organic, or sense, and its intellectual energies co-operate; and in relation to man, nature and the universe the ego gradually finds its true individuality by becoming a part of them, "every extension of consciousness being higher life."

The specific functions of the ego, as determined by the relative predominance of sense or intellect, are either functions of the senses (or [[organism]]) or functions of the intellect. The former fall into the two classes of feelings (subjective) and perceptions (objective); the latter, according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates, into cognition and volition. In cognition, thought is ontologically oriented to the object; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought. In the first case we receive (in our fashion) the object of thought into ourselves. In the latter we plant it out into the world. Both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action.

It is in those two functions that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are the sense of being one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.

Schleiermacher's doctrine of knowledge accepts the fundamental principle of Kant that knowledge is bounded by experience, but it seeks to remove Kant's scepticism as to knowledge of the ''[[ding an sich]]'' (the ''noumenon'') or ''Sein'', as Schleiermacher's term is. The idea of knowledge or scientific thought as distinguished from the passive form of thought — of aesthetics and religion — is thought which is produced by all thinkers in the same form and which corresponds to being. All knowledge takes the form of the concept (''Begriff'') or the judgment (''Urteil''), the former conceiving the variety of being as a definite unity and plurality, and the latter simply connecting the concept with certain individual objects.

In the concept therefore the intellectual and in the judgment the organic or sense element predominates. The universal uniformity of the production of judgments presupposes the uniformity of our relations to the outward world, and the uniformity of concepts rests similarly on the likeness of our inward nature. This uniformity is not based on the sameness of either the intellectual or the organic functions alone, but on the correspondence of the forms of thought and sensation with the forms of being. The essential nature of the concept is that it combines the general and the special, and the same combination recurs in being; in being the system of substantial or permanent forms answers to the system of concepts and the relation of cause and effect to the system of judgments, the higher concept answering to "force" and the lower to the phenomena of force, and the judgment to the contingent interaction of things.

The sum of being consists of the two systems of substantial forms and interactional relations, and it reappears in the form of concept and judgment, the concept representing being and the judgment being in action. Knowledge has under both forms the same object, the relative difference of the two being that when the conceptual form predominates we have speculative science and when the form of judgment prevails we have empirical or historical science. Throughout the domain of knowledge the two forms are found in constant mutual relations, another proof of the fundamental unity of thought and being or of the objectivity of knowledge. Plato, Spinoza and Kant had contributed characteristic elements of their thought to this system, and directly or indirectly it was largely indebted to Schelling for fundamental conceptions.

=== Hermeneutics ===
Schleiermacher's work has had a profound impact upon the philosophical field of [[hermeneutics]].  In fact, Schleiermacher is often referred to as "the father of modern hermeneutics as a general study."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Richard E. ''Hermeneutics''. Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  While Schleiermacher did not publish extensively on hermeneutics during his lifetime, he lectured widely on the field. His published and unpublished writings on hermeneutics were collected together after his death, albeit with some disagreement over ordering and placement of individual texts and lecture notes.

Schleiermacher’s desire to approach hermeneutics in a more general sense was an attempt to shift away from more specific methods of interpretation, such as ways of interpreting biblical or classical texts, to a focus on the way in which people understand texts in general. Though he was certainly interested in interpreting Scripture, he thought one could only do so properly once one had established a system of interpretation that was applicable to all texts. This process was not a systematic or strictly philological approach, but what he called "the art of understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. "The Hermeneutics:  Outline of the 1819 Lectures," ''New Literary History'', Vol.10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schleiermacher understood that reading a text was a discourse between the interpreter and the text itself; however, he considered the text as the means by which the author is communicating thoughts previous to the creation of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E.  "The Hermeneutics:  Outline of the 1819 Lectures," ''New Literary History'', Vol.10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  These thoughts are what ultimately cause the author to produce the text, thus the place where these "inner thoughts" become "outer expression" in language is at the moment of text creation.  This is where the meaning of a text ultimately resides for Schleiermacher.

In order to interpret a text, then, the interpreter must consider both the inner thoughts of the author and the language that s/he used in writing the text.  This artistic approach to interpreting texts contained within it an ebb-and-flow between what Schleiermacher called the "grammatical interpretation" and the "psychological (or technical) interpretation."  The former deals with the language of the text, the latter with the thoughts and aims of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. ed. Andrew Bowie. ''Hermeneutics and Criticism''. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate goal of hermeneutics for Schleiermacher is "understanding in the highest sense."&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. ed. Andrew Bowie. ''Hermeneutics and Criticism''. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 228&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the object to be understood stems from a thought of an author, and then is expressed through language.  The relationship of the author to language is cyclical, since the author is limited by his/her language and historical context, but s/he also contributes to language as a whole through new ideas and the appropriation of language.&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. "The Hermeneutics:  Outline of the 1819 Lectures," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 5;10.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interpreter must understand how its original audience understood this language.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich D. E. Schleiermacher, "The Hermeneutics:  Outline of the 1819 Lectures," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the language used by an author "is what mediates sensuously and externally between utterer and listener"&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. ed. Andrew Bowie. ''Hermeneutics and Criticism''. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; the art of understanding becomes just as much the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Schleiermacher divides misunderstanding into two forms: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative misunderstanding is not understanding the content, or "the confusion of the meaning of a word for another."&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. "The Hermeneutics: Outline of the 1819 Lectures," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Quantitative is misunderstanding the nuance in the author’s own "sphere." As a result of these possible misunderstandings, the need for the grammatical side of interpretation is glaring.

The grammatical interpretation leads to the technical interpretation as the reader attempts to understand why the author selected the language s/he did to convey his/her inner thoughts.  Part of the task of hermeneutics is to fully understand these thoughts through the author’s discourse, even better than the author him/herself.&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. "The Hermeneutics:  Outline of the 1819 Lectures," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done by discovering unity within the author, first in knowing why a particular work was produced, secondly in other works produced in a similar genre by others, and finally by other works by the same author in any genre.&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. ed. Andrew Bowie. ''Hermeneutics and Criticism''. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The interpreter can then evaluate what the effect of the work was on the author’s context.  If a reader can understand the psyche of the author, s/he can understand the work, but only in balance with the grammatical side of interpretation, which attempts to understand the work to understand the inner thoughts of the author. "Understanding" for Schleiermacher is the art of experiencing the same process of thought that the author experienced. Understanding is made possible by the fact that author and reader, since both are human, share the reasoning ability. Therefore, the process of understanding is not only a historical process, learning about the context in which the author wrote, but also a psychological process, drawing upon the connection between interpreter and the author. Thus, hermeneutics is a cyclical task, but for Schleiermacher it is not viciously circular because of the role of intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer|last = Palmer|first = Richard|publisher = Northwestern University Press|year = 1969|isbn = 9780810104594|location = Evanston, IL|pages = 87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans, therefore, interpreters approach a text with some shared understanding with the author that creates the possibility of understanding.

Despite Schleiermacher’s claim to the potential understanding of the author’s thoughts better than the author, he grants that "good interpretation can only be approximated" and that hermeneutics is not a "perfect art."&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. "The Hermeneutics:  Outline of the 1819 Lectures," ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The art puts the interpreter in the best position by "putting oneself in possession of all the conditions of understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. ed. Andrew Bowie. ''Hermeneutics and Criticism''. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 227.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the extent of an interpreter’s understanding of a text is mostly limited by his or her own potential to misunderstand a text.

The impact of Schleiermacher's work on hermeneutics is significant. The claim of Schleiermacher as the father of hermeneutics seems to be justified by the fact that his work marks the beginning of hermeneutics as a general field of inquiry, separate from the specific disciplines (e.g. law or theology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hermeneutics|last = Palmer|first = Richard|publisher = Northwestern University Press|year = 1969|isbn = 9780810104594|location = Evanston, IL|pages = 96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; His focus on hermeneutics as a theory of interpretation for any textual expression would be expanded even further to the theory of interpretation of lived experiences in the twentieth century by those like [[Heidegger]], [[Gadamer]], and [[Ricoeur]].

=== Ethics ===
[[File:Schleiermacher-tomb.JPG|thumb|upright|His grave in Berlin]]
Next to religion and theology, Schleiermacher devoted himself to the moral world, of which the phenomena of religion and theology were, in his systems, only constituent elements. In his earlier essays he endeavoured to point out the defects of ancient and modern ethical thinkers, particularly of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], with only [[Plato]] and [[Spinoza]] finding favour in his eyes. He failed to discover in previous moral systems any necessary basis in thought, any completeness as regards the phenomena of moral action, any systematic arrangement of its parts and any clear and distinct treatment of specific moral acts and relations.

Schleiermacher's own moral system is an attempt to supply these deficiencies. It connects the moral world by a deductive process with the fundamental idea of knowledge and being; it offers a view of the entire world of human action which at all events aims at being exhaustive; it presents an arrangement of the matter of the science which tabulates its constituents after the model of the physical sciences; and it supplies a sharply defined treatment of specific moral phenomena in their relation to the fundamental idea of human life as a whole. Schleiermacher defines ethics as the theory of the nature of the reason, or as the scientific treatment of the effects produced by human reason in the world of nature and man.

As a theoretical or speculative science it is purely descriptive and not practical, being correlated on the one hand to physical science and on the other to history. Its method is the same as that of physical science, being distinguished from the latter only by its matter. The ontological basis of ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal, and the psychological and actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former. The end of the ethical process is that nature (i.e. all that is not mind, the human body as well as external nature) may become the perfect symbol and organ of mind.

Conscience, as the subjective expression of the presupposed identity of reason and nature in their bases, guarantees the practicability of our moral vocation. Nature is preordained or constituted to become the symbol and organ of mind, just as mind is endowed with the impulse to realize this end. But the moral law must not be conceived under the form of an "imperative" or a "''Sollen''"; it differs from a law of nature only as being descriptive of the fact that it ranks the mind as conscious will, or ''Zweckdenken'', above nature. Strictly speaking, the antitheses of good and bad and of free and necessary have no place in an ethical system, but simply in history, which is obliged to compare the actual with the ideal, but as far as the terms "good" and "bad" are used in morals they express the rule or the contrary of reason, or the harmony or the contrary of the particular and the general. The idea of free as opposed to necessary expresses simply the fact that the mind can propose to itself ends, though a man cannot alter his own nature.

In contrast to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and modern moral philosophers, Schleiermacher reintroduced and assigned pre-eminent importance to the doctrine of the ''[[summum bonum]]'', or highest good. It represents in his system the ideal and aim of the entire life of man, supplying the ethical view of the conduct of individuals in relation to society and the universe, and therewith constituting a philosophy of history at the same time. Starting with the idea of the highest good and of its constituent elements (''Güter''), or the chief forms of the union of mind and nature, Schleiermacher's system divides itself into the doctrine of moral ends, the doctrine of virtue and the doctrine of duties; in other words, as a development of the idea of the subjection of nature to reason it becomes a description of the actual forms of the triumphs of reason, of the moral power manifested therein and of the specific methods employed. Every moral good or product has a fourfold character: it is individual and' universal; it is an organ and symbol of the reason, that is, it is the product of the individual with relation to the community, and represents or manifests as well as classifies and rules nature.

The first two characteristics provide for the functions and rights of the individual as well as those of the community or race. Though a moral action may have these four characteristics at various degrees of strength, it ceases to be moral if one of them is quite absent. All moral products may be classified according to the predominance of one or the other of these characteristics. Universal organizing action produces the forms of intercourse, and universal symbolizing action produces the various forms of science; individual organizing action yields the forms of property and individual symbolizing action the various representations of feeling, all these constituting the relations, the productive spheres, or the social conditions of moral action. Moral functions cannot be performed by the individual in isolation but only in his relation to the family, the state, the school, the church, and society — all forms of human life which ethical science finds to its hand and leaves to the science of natural history to account for. The moral process is accomplished by the various sections of humanity in their individual spheres, and the doctrine of virtue deals with the reason as the moral power in each individual by which the totality of moral products is obtained.

Schleiermacher classifies the virtues under the two forms of ''Gesinnung'' ("disposition, attitude") and ''Fertigkeit'' ("dexterity, proficiency"), the first consisting of the pure ideal element in action and the second the form it assumes in relation to circumstances, each of the two classes falling respectively into the two divisions of wisdom and love and of intelligence and application. In his system the doctrine of duty is the description of the method of the attainment of ethical ends, the conception of duty as an imperative, or obligation, being excluded, as we have seen. No action fulfills the conditions of duty except as it combines the three following antitheses: reference to the moral idea in its whole extent and likewise to a definite moral sphere; connection with existing conditions and at the same time absolute personal production; the fulfillment of the entire moral vocation every moment though it can only be done in a definite sphere. Duties are divided with reference to the principle that every man make his own the entire moral problem and act at the same time in an existing moral society. This condition gives four general classes of duty: duties of general association or duties with reference to the community (''Rechtspflicht''), and duties of vocation (''Berufspflicht'') — both with a universal reference, duties of the conscience (in which the individual is sole judge), and duties of love or of personal association.

It was only the first of the three sections of the science of ethics — the doctrine of moral ends — that Schleiermacher handled with approximate completeness; the other two sections were treated very summarily. In his Christian Ethics he dealt with the subject from the basis of the Christian consciousness instead of from that of reason generally; the ethical phenomena dealt with are the same in both systems, and they throw light on each other, while the Christian system treats more at length and less aphoristically the principal ethical realities — church, state, family, art, science and society. [[Richard Rothe|Rothe]], amongst other moral philosophers, bases his system substantially, with important departures, on Schleiermacher's. In [[Friedrich Eduard Beneke|Beneke]]'s moral system his fundamental idea was worked out in its psychological relations.

Schleiermacher held that an [[problem of hell|eternal hell]] was not compatible with the love of God.  Divine punishment was rehabilitative, not penal, and designed to reform the person.&lt;ref&gt;Gunton, Colin E. ''The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine''. p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of the first major theologians of modern times to teach [[Christian Universalism]].

=== Writings concerning society ===
''On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers'' is a book written by Schleiermacher dealing with the gap he saw as emerging between the cultural elite and general society. Schleiermacher was writing when the Enlightenment was in full swing and when the first major transition into modernity was simultaneously occurring. With the fall of the late Middle Ages and a vigorous discourse taking hold of Western European intellectuals, the fields of art and natural philosophy were flourishing. However, the discourse of theologians, arguably the primary and only discourse of intellectuals for centuries, had taken to its own now minor corner in the universities. ''On Religion'' is divided into five major sections: the Defense (''Apologie''), the Nature of Religion (''Über das Wesen der Religion''), the Cultivation of Religion (''Über die Bildung zur Religion''), Association in Religion (''Über das Gesellige in der Religion, oder über Kirche und Priesterthum''), and the Religions (''Über die Religionen''). Schleiermacher initiates his speeches on religion in its opening chapter by asserting that the contemporary critique of religion is often over-simplified by the assumption that there are two supposed "hinges" upon which all critiques of religion(s) are based. These two over-simplifications are given by Schleiermacher as first, that their conscience shall be put into judgement, and second, the "general idea turns on the fear of an eternal being, or, broadly, respect for his influence on the occurrences of this life called by you providence, or expectation of a future life after this one, called by you immortality."&lt;ref&gt;F. Scheiermacher, ''On Religion'', Ch.1, pp12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious thought ===
From [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]] and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] school, Schleiermacher had imbibed a profound and mystical view of the inner depths of the human personality. His religious thought found its expression most notably in ''The Christian Faith'', one of the most influential works of Christian theology of its time.

Schleiermacher saw the ego, the person, as an individualization of [[universal reason]]; and the primary act of [[self-consciousness]] as the first conjunction of universal and individual life, the immediate union or marriage of the universe with incarnated reason. Thus every person becomes a specific and original representation of the universe and a compendium of humanity, a microcosmos in which the world is immediately reflected. While therefore we cannot, as we have seen, attain the idea of the supreme unity of thought and being by either cognition or volition, we can find it in our own personality, in immediate self-consciousness or (which is the same in Schleiermacher's terminology) feeling. Feeling in this higher sense (as distinguished from "organic" sensibility, ''Empfindung''), which is the minimum of distinct antithetic consciousness, the cessation of the antithesis of subject and object, constitutes likewise the unity of our being, in which the opposite functions of [[cognition]] and [[volition (psychology)|volition]] have their fundamental and permanent background of personality and their transitional link. Having its seat in this central point of our being, or indeed consisting in the essential fact of self-consciousness, religion lies at the basis of all thought, feeling and action.

At various periods of his life Schleiermacher used different terms to represent the character and relation of religious feeling. In his earlier days he called it a feeling or intuition of the universe, consciousness of the unity of reason and nature, of the infinite and the eternal within the finite and the temporal. In later life he described it as the feeling of absolute dependence, or, as meaning the same thing, the consciousness of being in relation to God. In his [[On Religion|''Addresses on Religion'']] (1799), he wrote:&lt;ref name ="N"&gt;Quoted in Kedourie, Elie. ''Nationalism'', p. 26. Praeger University Series. 1961. {{ISBN|0-09-053444-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|Religion is the outcome neither of the fear of death, nor of the fear of God. It answers a deep need in man. It is neither a metaphysic, nor a morality, but above all and essentially an intuition and a feeling. ... Dogmas are not, properly speaking, part of religion: rather it is that they are derived from it. Religion is the miracle of direct relationship with the infinite; and dogmas are the reflection of this miracle. Similarly belief in God, and in personal immortality, are not necessarily a part of religion; one can conceive of a religion without God, and it would be pure contemplation of the universe; the desire for personal immortality seems rather to show a lack of religion, since religion assumes a desire to lose oneself in the infinite, rather than to preserve one's own finite self.}}

== Reception ==
The Dutch Reformed theologian [[Herman Bavinck]], deeply concerned with the problem of objectivism and subjectivism in the doctrine of revelation, employs Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation in his own way and regards the Bible as the objective standard for his theological work. Bavinck also stresses the importance of the church, which forms the Christian consciousness and experience. In so doing, he attempts to overcome the latent weakness of Schleiermacher’s doctrine of revelation through his emphasis on the ecclesiological doctrine of revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

'''Piana Giovanni''' (born April 5, 1940) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[philosopher]]. He taught theoretical philosophy at the [[University of Milan]] from 1970 to 1999. Later, he went to live at Pietrabianca di Sangineto ([[Calabria]]), from which he continues to write and publish.

He was a disciple of Enzo Paci and wrote his dissertation on [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]'s unpublished works.

His philosophical position is characterised by the concept of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] ("phenomenological structuralism") influenced by Husserl, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], and [[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard]]. Some indications about phenomenological structuralism are contained in the online article: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070313143533/http://www.filosofia.unimi.it/~piana/struttur/hmstrukt.htm "Die Idee eines phänomenologischen Strukturalismus"].

His thought is oriented towards the philosophy of knowledge, the philosophy of [[music]], and the fields of [[perception]] and [[imagination]].

'''Henry Aldrich''' (1647 – 14 December 1710) was an English theologian, philosopher, and composer.

==Life==
Aldrich was educated at [[Westminster School]] under [[Richard Busby|Dr Richard Busby]]. In 1662, he entered [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and in 1689 was made [[Dean (college)|Dean]] in succession to the [[Roman Catholic]] [[John Massey (Dean)|John Massey]], who had fled to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]].&lt;ref name="salter"&gt;{{cite book | editor=Salter, H.

Henry Aldrich was a man of unusually varied gifts. A [[classical scholar]] of fair merits, he is best known as the author of a little book on [[logic]] (''Artis Logicæ Compendium''&lt;ref name="a_l_c"&gt;{{cite book| last=Aldrich | first=Henry | title=Artis logicæ compendium | year=1750 | publisher=[[Oxford University]] | pages=147 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxoFAAAAQAAJ | accessdate=22 July 2011 | archivedate=17 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxoFAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Although not innovative in the field of Logic itself (it closely follows [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]]'s ''Summulae Logicales''), its insistent use by generations of Oxford students has shown it to be of great synthetic and didactic value: the Compendium continued to be read at Oxford (in [[Henry Longueville Mansel|Mansel]]'s revised edition) till long past the middle of the 19th century.

Aldrich also composed a number of anthems and church services of high merit, and adapted much of the music of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]] and [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]] to English words with great skill and judgment. To him we owe the well-known catch, "Hark, the bonny Christ Church bells."

[[Image:Christ Church (Oxford).jpg|thumb|[[Peckwater Quadrangle]] of Christ Church, Oxford, designed by Henry Aldrich.]]
Evidence of his skill as an architect may be seen in the church and [[campanile]] of [[All Saints Church, Oxford]], and in three sides of the so-called [[Peckwater Quadrangle]] of Christ Church, which were erected after his designs. He bore a great reputation for conviviality', and wrote a humorous [[Latin]] version of the popular ballad ''A soldier and a sailor, A tinker and a tailor'', etc.

Another specimen of his wit is furnished by the following epigram of the five reasons for drinking:

:''Si bene quid memini, causae sunt quinque bibendi;''
:''Hospitis adventus, praesens sitis atque futura,''
:''Aut vini bonitas, aut quaelibet altera causa.''

The translation runs:

:If on my theme I rightly think,
:There are five reasons why men drink:—
:Good wine; a friend; because I'm dry;
:Or lest I should be by and by;
:Or — any other reason why.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48454">A '''hub-and-spoke conspiracy''' (or '''hub-and-spokes conspiracy''') is a legal construct or doctrine of United States antitrust and criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. use of the doctrine can be traced to an origin in the 1930s or 1940s. See ''Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States'', 306 U.S. 208 (1939); ''Kotteakos v. United States'', 328 U.S. 750 (1946). But since 2000 European cartel authorities have begun to use the concept. See, e.g.,  [http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/Jdg_CoA_1014Argos_Little_JJB191006.pdf ''JJB Sports PLC v Office of Fair Trading''], [2006] EWCA Civ 1318(UK Ct App 2003).&lt;br&gt;See also {{cite AustLII|FCA|1813|1996|litigants=News Ltd v Australian Rugby League Ltd (No 2) |parallelcite=(1996) 64 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 410 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a conspiracy, several parties ("spokes") enter into an unlawful agreement with a leading party ("hub"). The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] explained the concept in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a "hub-and-spoke conspiracy," a central mastermind, or "hub," controls numerous "spokes," or secondary co-conspirators. These co-conspirators participate in independent transactions with the individual or group of individuals at the "hub" that collectively further a single, illegal enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Newton'', 326 F.3d 253, 255 n.2 (1st Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] explained the concept in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such a conspiracy involves a hub, generally the dominant purchaser or supplier in the relevant market, and the spokes, made up of the distributors involved in the conspiracy. The rim of the wheel is the connecting agreements among the horizontal competitors (distributors) that form the spokes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1921/howard-hess-dental-v-dentsply-intern/ ''Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int’l, Inc.'', 602 F.3d 237, 255 (3d Cir. 2010).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The antitrust cases often emphasize the importance of interdependence among the spokes and their recognition of one another. The general criminal cases, such as narcotics conspiracy prosecutions, tend to require only a more general knowledge among the spokes that there is a larger overall unlawful scheme involving other actors who are cooperating with the hub in carrying out the scheme. It is controversial, particularly in the antitrust cases, how much knowledge spoke actors must have of the conduct of other spoke actors—which is to say how much of a "rim" must be put around the "wheel" of the hub-and-spoke conspiracy for it to be a single conspiracy rather than many separate "vertical" conspiracies. There is a controversy and some uncertainty over the legal status of the "rimless" conspiracy—one with very limited interaction among the spokes.

==History==

The leading two Supreme Court cases were ''Interstate Circuit'' and ''Kotteakos''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/306/208/case.html ''Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States''], 306 U.S. 208 (1939); [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/750/case.html ''Kotteakos v. United States''], 328 U.S. 750 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate Circuit===

In [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/306/208/case.html ''[[Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States]]''],&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. 208 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt; the Government sued two groups of defendants for engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy. One group of eight defendants were distributors (such as Paramount Pictures) of motion picture films, that distributed about 75 percent of all first-class feature films exhibited in the United States.. A second group of defendants were two dominant theater owners in Texas and New Mexico—Interstate Circuit and a related company—which had a monopoly of first-run theaters in various cities.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 214-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
The manager of the defendant theater owners sent a same or similar letter to each of the distributor defendants, naming on its face as addressees all of the defendant distributors. The letter demanded as a condition of continued dealing that the distributor (1) require that second-run theaters never exhibit the films at a smaller admission price than 25¢, and (2) never exhibit them in conjunction with another feature picture (so-called double features). Conferences discussing the matter were held between representatives of Interstate and individual distributors. The distributors each agreed and complied with the demands.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 216-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court held it permissible to draw "the inference of agreement from the nature of the proposals made .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.[and] from the substantial unanimity of action taken upon them by the distributors." The Court emphasized that each distributor knew that the distributors all knew that the others were getting the same letter and knew that "without substantially unanimous action with respect to the restrictions for any given territory, there was risk of a substantial loss of the business and goodwill of the subsequent-run and independent exhibitors, but that, with it, there was the prospect of increased profits." The Court said that provided "strong motive for concerted action."&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it. Each distributor was advised that the others were asked to participate; each knew that cooperation was essential to successful operation of the plan. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Acceptance by competitors, without previous agreement, of an invitation to participate in a plan the necessary consequence of which, if carried out, is restraint of interstate commerce is sufficient to establish an unlawful conspiracy under the Sherman Act.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kotteakos===

In [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/750/case.html ''Kotteakos v. United States''],&lt;ref&gt;328 U.S. 750 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Brown, owner of a construction company, conspired with Kotteakos and 31 other persons to defraud the Government by filing false statements in applications for loans for modernization and renovation under the National Housing Act. No connections was shown between the individual loan applicants. In each case, however, Brown induced the applicants to file the loan application and assisted them in applying, in return for a 5% commission.

[[File:Logoruota-romani.svg|thumb|100px|right]]

The Court characterized the facts as showing: "As the Government puts it, the pattern was 'that of separate spokes meeting at a common center,' though we may add without the rim of the wheel to enclose the spokes." The Court therefore held that while the indictment alleged one conspiracy the Government proved several (at least eight) conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;328 U.S. at 755.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the Government failed to demonstrate the rim of the wheel, that connected the spokes to one another. "Without the rim, an alleged hub-and-spoke cartel is merely a set of vertical relationships (or restraints) that result in parallel conduct and does not establish" a hub-and-spoke conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Barak Orbach, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/antitrust_source/apr16_orbach_4_11f.authcheckdam.pdf '' Hub-and-Spoke Conspiracies''], {{smallcaps|the antitrust source}} (April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent Supreme Court hub-and-spoke conspiracy cases==

Since ''Interstate Circuit'', the Supreme Court decided four hub-and-spoke conspiracy cases and one case rejecting a parallel-action conspiracy claim.

===Masonite===

''[[United States v. Masonite Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. 265 (1942),&lt;/ref&gt; was a patent–antitrust price-fixing case, in which the patent holder negotiated licenses with price-fixing clauses while resolving infringement disputes with some of the licensees. The Supreme Court said that each licensee “acted independently of the others, negotiated only with [the patent holder], desired the agreement regardless of the action that might be taken by any of the others, did not require as a condition of its acceptance . . . an agreement with any of the others, and had no discussions with any of the others."&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. at 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Court applied ''Interstate Circuit'' because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not clear at what precise point of time each [defendant licensee] became aware of the fact that its contract was not an isolated transaction but part of a larger arrangement. But it [was] clear that as the arrangement continued each became familiar with its purpose and scope.”&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. at 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, even if the evidentiary requirements of ''Interstate Circuit'' were not met at the outset of the cartel arrangement, they were met after it remained in place. "It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it."

===Blumenthal===

In ''Blumenthal v. United States'', the Supreme Court looked at the other side of the coin of ''Kotteakos''. The Court distinguished the ''Kotteakos'' case involving several conspiracies from the case before it involving one conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[In ''Kotteakos''] no two of those agreements were tied together as stages in the formation of a larger all-inclusive combination, all directed to achieving a single unlawful end or result. On the contrary each separate agreement had its own distinct, illegal end. Each loan was an end in itself, separate from all others, although all were alike in having similar illegal objects. Except for Brown, the common figure, no conspirator was interested in whether any loan except his own went through. And none aided in any way, by agreement or otherwise, in procuring another's loan. The conspiracies therefore were distinct and disconnected, not parts of a larger general scheme, both in the phase of agreement with Brown and also in the absence of any aid given to others as well as in specific object and result. There was no drawing of all together in a single, over-all, comprehensive plan. Here the contrary is true. All knew of and joined in the overriding scheme.&lt;ref&gt;''Blumenthal v. United States'', 332 U.S. 539, 558 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theater Enterprises===

In ''Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/537/case.html 346 U.S. 537] (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court rejected a claim by a suburban theater owner (TEI) that a group of motion picture producers and distributors had violated the antitrust laws by conspiring to restrict first-run films to downtown Baltimore theaters, thus confining petitioner's suburban theater to subsequent runs and unreasonable "clearances." Each of the defendant motion picture producers and distributors refused to make first-run films available to TEI and adhered to an established policy of restricting first-runs in Baltimore to the eight downtown theaters. There was no direct evidence of illegal agreement among the defendants. The "crucial question" was whether the defendants' conduct against TEI "stemmed from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express." The lower court, in effect, refused to direct the jury to find a conspiracy based on the facts as to parallel refusals to deal with TEI. The Supreme Court said that was correct, because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]his Court has never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement or, phrased differently, that such behavior itself constitutes a Sherman Act offense. Circumstantial evidence of consciously parallel behavior may have made heavy inroads into the traditional judicial attitude toward conspiracy, but "conscious parallelism" has not yet read conspiracy out of the Sherman Act entirely.&lt;ref&gt;346 U.S. at 541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Klor's===

In ''[[Klor’s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/359/207/case.html 359 U.S. 207] (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; a major California department store, Broadway-Hale, induced  Admiral, Emerson Radio, General Electric, Philco, RCA, Whirlpool, Zenith, and other major appliance manufacturers to stop selling to Klor's, a price cutter in San Francisco. Klor's brought an antitrust treble damages suit, alleging a conspiracy among Broadway-Hale and the manufacturers. By pre-trial order the case one was limited to a single conspiracy charging a Sherman Act violation. The defendants moved for summary judgment, and the lower courts agreed, on the grounds that Klor's was only one of many stores selling such goods, so that its elimination as a competitive factor did not substantially lessen competition in the general market—there was no public injury. Whether a conspiracy existed was by-passed, even though the allegations appear to have described a rimless wheel conspiracy, without the spokes (appliance manufacturers) being connected to one another, knowing what one another were doing, or being interdependent. The Supreme Court reversed, on the grounds that Klor's sufficiently pleaded a boycott conspiracy. The Court said, "Alleged in this complaint is a wide combination consisting of manufacturers, distributors, and a retailer."&lt;ref&gt;359 U.S. at 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parke, Davis===

In ''[[United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. 29 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held it proper to infer a combination among a drug manufacturer, wholesalers, and retailers when the manufacturer engaged in a substantial course of concerted activities in order to stop discounters from selling its products below recommended resale prices. The manufacturer 
informed its wholesalers that it would terminate any wholesaler that sold its products to discounters, and enforced this policy. It discussed the policy with its wholesalers and retailers to secure adherence to it, and it put together an agreement among retailers not to advertise products at prices below those recommended. Parke Davis offered the retailers its products "packaged in a competition-free wrapping .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. by virtue of concerted action induced by the manufacturer." Parke Davis was "thus the organizer of a price maintenance combination or conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act."

===General Motors===

In ''United States v. General Motors Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/127/case.html 384 U.S. 127] (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Chevrolet car dealers in the Los Angeles area persuaded GM to eliminate price cutters. In response to dealers' complaints organized by their trade associations, GM Los Angeles area officials treated the "principal offenders" to "unprecedented individual confrontations" and obtained promises to abandon the practices deemed objectionable. Most agreed promptly but one put off decision for a week "to make sure that the other dealers, or most of them, had stopped their business dealings with discount houses." A "joint effort between General Motors, the three [local dealer] associations, and a number of individual dealers" was organized to police compliance. GM local officials confronted reoffenders and required them to repurchase cars sold in violation of policy. "[T]he campaign to eliminate the discounters from commerce in new Chevrolet cars was a success."

The district court refused to find a Sherman Act violation. But the Supreme Court reversed. It explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dealers collaborated, through the associations and otherwise, among themselves and with General Motors, both to enlist the aid of General Motors and to enforce dealers' promises to forsake the discounters. The associations explicitly entered into a joint venture to assist General Motors in policing the dealers' promises, and their joint proffer of aid was accepted and utilized by General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;384 at U.S. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not only did the dealers conspire among themselves but they enlisted GM to act as the "hub" of the conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As Parke Davis had done, General Motors sought to elicit from all the dealers agreements, substantially interrelated and interdependent, that none of them would do business with the discounters. These agreements were hammered out in meetings between nonconforming dealers and officials of General Motors' Chevrolet Division, and in telephone conversations with other dealers. It was acknowledged from the beginning that substantial unanimity would be essential if the agreements were to be forthcoming. And once the agreements were secured, General Motors both solicited and employed the assistance of its alleged co-conspirators in helping to police them. What resulted was a fabric interwoven by many strands of joint action to eliminate the discounters from participation in the market, to inhibit the free choice of franchised dealers to select their own methods of trade, and to provide multilateral surveillance and enforcement. This process for achieving and enforcing the desired objective can by no stretch of the imagination be described as "unilateral" or merely "parallel."&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 144-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This conduct was illegal ''per se''. "Exclusion of traders from the market by means of combination or conspiracy is so inconsistent with the free market principles embodied in the Sherman Act that it is not to be saved by reference to the need for preserving the collaborators' profit margins or their system for distributing automobiles, any more than by reference to the allegedly tortious conduct against which a combination or conspiracy may be directed.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was price fxing.&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 147-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent lower court cases==

The various courts of appeals have interpreted and modified the Supreme Court's rulings on hub-and-spoke conspiracies.

===Drug cases===

====Poliafico====

One of the cases that the Supreme Court relied on in ''Blumenthal'' was ''Poliafico''. In ''Poliafico v. United States'', the Sixth Circuit found a conspiracy to sell heroin among several suppliers in bulk and their retail supplier agents (street dealers) who retailed it to addicts in diluted form and in smaller quantities. The Sixth Circuit explained the structure of the hub-and-spoke conspiracy as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All of the appellants were either selling heroin to Poliafico and his associates, or reselling it for them, or carrying on negotiations for such sales, or making payments therefor, or delivering heroin for resale, or reselling it. The purchase of heroin and the resale of heroin, in this case, was concerned with one enterprise, which could be called the Poliafico deal, in the parlance of the underworld. The over-all conspiracy was the plan, conceived by Poliafico and his associates, to buy and sell heroin at a profit. The [retail] suppliers knew that the purchases were for resale and they also knew that several conspirators were involved in the purchases.&lt;ref&gt;''Poliafico v. United States'', 237 F.2d 97, 103 (6th Cir. 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court said, "The fact that one such [retail] supplier did not have dealings with another [retail] supplier does not matter," because if "each performs the same role at successive stages for the same ends, and both know and participate in the plan of the others to buy and sell heroin at a profit, each is guilty as a conspirator."&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 103-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The court explained its concept of a hub-and-spoke conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When two or more persons are shown to have been engaged in the same unlawful conspiracy, having for its object the same common and unlawful purpose, it is not necessary to prove the knowledge by one of the dealings, or even of the existence, of the others, in order to render evidence of the actions of those others admissible against that person. There was one conspiracy in this case — the continuing scheme of buying and reselling heroin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; 
The proofs of the government show that all appellants were associated in this scheme, some by virtue of selling or delivering the heroin to the Poliafico group, others because of being associated with the group in carrying out the scheme, collecting money through resales of the drug, making payments to suppliers, or carrying on negotiations for the purchase or resale. All appellants knew of the conspiracy. The suppliers knew that the Poliafico group must resell the heroin at a profit; and all associated with Poliafico in the resale of the heroin knew that Poliafico must buy it from suppliers and that the resales must be at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is not necessary for each conspirator to know the whole scope or all the details of the conspiracy. "He must know the [unlawful] purpose of the conspiracy, however, otherwise he is not guilty."&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other narcotics conspiracy cases are similar. For example, in ''United States v. Tramaglino'',&lt;ref&gt;197 F.2d 928 (2d Cir. 1952).&lt;/ref&gt; a distinguished panel of the Second Circuit (Swan, A. Hand, and Frank) found a single conspiracy to buy and resell marijuana based on "evidence of several sales, at different periods, by Rosario and Tramaglino, of marihuana to the same group of buyers with knowledge on the part of the two suppliers that several conspirators were involved in the purchases and that the purchases were for resale." The court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This was enough, we think, to show that each appellant, as supplier, participated in, and acted to further the ends of, the conspiracy. It did not matter that neither had dealings with one another; each performed the same role at successive stages for the same ends. The overall conspiracy was the plan conceived by the intermediary group — Alvarez, Zayas, and their fellows — to buy and resell marihuana at a profit. Both Rosario and Tramaglino knew and participated in this plan by furnishing the essential ingredient — the marihuana.&lt;ref&gt;197 F.2d at 930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Chain conspiracy====

A closely related concept to the hub-and-spoke conspiracy, or a variation on it, is the chain conspiracy, which is linear rather than wheel-shaped. A representative example is ''United States v. Bruno''. In ''Bruno'' 88 people were alleged to be members of a single conspiracy to import, sell and possess narcotics. The evidence was that over a substantial period of time a conspiracy existed embracing a great number of persons. The object of the conspiracy was to smuggle narcotics into New York and distribute them to addicts both in New York and in Texas and Louisiana. "This required the cooperation of four groups of persons: the smugglers who imported the drugs; the middlemen who paid the smugglers and distributed to retailers; and two groups of retailers — one in New York and one in Texas and Louisiana — who supplied the addicts."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Bruno'', 105 F.2d 921 (2d Cir. 1939) (L. Hand, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants argued that there were at least three separate conspiracies: one between the smugglers and the middlemen, one in New York between the New York middlemen and group of retailers. and one in Texas and Louisiana between those middlemen and retailers. Since the evidence did not disclose any cooperation or communication between the smugglers and either group of retailers, or between the two groups of retailers themselves. However, insisted the court:

[[File:Twisted link chain.jpg|thumb|right|100px]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;The smugglers knew that the middlemen must sell to retailers, and the retailers knew that the middlemen must buy of importers of one sort or another. Thus the conspirators at one end of the chain knew that the unlawful business would not, and could not, stop with their buyers; and those at the other end knew that it had not begun with their sellers. That being true, a jury might have found that all the accused were embarked upon a [single] venture, in all parts of which each was a participant, and an abettor in the sense that the success of that part with which he was immediately concerned, was dependent upon the success of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;105 F.2d at 922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There could also be two conspiracies—one in New York including the smugglers, the New York middlemen and the New York group of retailers; and the other including the smugglers, the Gulf Coast middlemen and the Gulf Coast group of retailers. There was apparently no contact between the two groups of retailers, possibly negating their being in a conspiracy together. "That too would be fallacious," the court said, because there was only one conspiracy as far as the defendant smugglers were concerned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For it was of no moment to them whether the middlemen sold to one or more groups of retailers, provided they had a market somewhere. So too of any retailer; he knew that he was a necessary link in a scheme of distribution, and the others, whom he knew to be convenient to its execution, were as much parts of a single undertaking or enterprise as two salesmen in the same shop. We think therefore that there was only one conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;105 F.2d at 923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To sustain a chain conspiracy charge, the evidence must establish "that each conspirator had the specific intent to further the common unlawful objective."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Tarantino'', 846 F.2d 1384, 1392 (D.C. Cir. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; It is immaterial that the individual co-conspirators do not know each other or meet. "Courts have long recognized that participants in a continuous drug distribution enterprise can be parties to a single conspiracy even if they do not all know one another, so long as each knows that his own role in the distribution of drugs and the benefits he derives from his participation depend on the activities of the others."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Childress'', 58 F.3d 693, 709-10 (D.C. Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elder-Beerman===

In ''Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.'', the plaintiff retailer E–B claimed that the defendant Federated department store chain conspired with 66 (later 12) suppliers in violation of the antitrust laws. E–B argued that Federated (and/or its predecessor Rike's) and the suppliers conspired to destroy E–B's ability to compete on fair terms, and for the purpose of attempting to obtain a department store monopoly in the Dayton, Ohio area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5983967853810117033&amp;q=309+F.3d+193&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.''], 459 F. 2d 138, 139–40 (6th Cir. 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sixth Circuit characterized E–B's legal theory as the "rimless wheel" theory. E–B contended that it had established a conspiracy by showing the following: Rike's used "coercion" to persuade some suppliers to grant Rike's the exclusive right to sell the merchandise involved; other suppliers granted exclusives to Rike's although E–B lacked evidence that Rike's had in fact used coercion to persuade them to do so; there was evidence of an exclusive relationship between Rike's and many of the suppliers; there was evidence of an exclusive arrangement resulting from "coercion" as to some of the suppliers; for the other suppliers, the basic evidence was they refused to sell to E–B; there was also evidence that Rike's refused to buy from certain suppliers who sold to E–B.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial court relied on ''Poliafico'' to find a single conspiracy. The Sixth Circuit said that in that case "by the very nature of the business everyone involved in the alleged conspiracy had to know that other persons would be performing illegal acts in furtherance of the conspiracy." It therefore appears that to establish a conspiracy under the rimless wheel theory, it must be shown:
:(1) that there is an overall-unlawful plan or "common design" in existence; 
:(2) that knowledge that others must be involved is inferable to each member because of his knowledge of the unlawful nature of the subject of the conspiracy but knowledge on the part of each member of the exact scope of the operation or the number of people involved is not required, and 
:(3) there must be a showing of each alleged member's participation.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since there was no evidence for each supplier that the supplier in fact had knowledge of the existence of such conspiracy, such a supplier could not be considered a spoke. "We, therefore, hold that on this record Elder-Beerman failed to offer sufficient probative evidence to establish the alleged single conspiracy upon which it bases its claim for damages." &lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

One judge dissented as to the conspiracy issue. He stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Elder-Beerman's theory, Rike's was the hub of the conspiratorial wheel and its exclusive suppliers were the spokes. One of the important questions in this case is whether the suppliers (or any of them) agreed with each other, as well as with Rike's, to participate in the conspiracy. My colleagues believe, and I believe, that there was no such evidence in this record. In short, there was no rim to this wheel, or to put it in more conventional antitrust language, there was no proof of a horizontal conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he considered it proper to find a single conspiracy as in ''Poliafico''. He found ''Kotteakos'' inapplicable because that was a ruling to protect the spokes from being tarred with one another's conduct after the hub had pleaded guilty. Here, in contrast, the supplier spokes are not in court, "and the case proceeds against the central party charged with the conspiracy, the hub of this particular wheel." Any error is harmless, he said, and the case is more like ''Klor's'' than like ''Kotteakos''.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toys "R" Us===

The ''Toys "R" Us'' chain of retail toy stores, the largest such U.S. chain (selling approximately 20% of all the toys sold in the United States), found itself encountering severe competition from price-cutting warehouse clubs. It became concerned that warehouse clubs—with substantially lower prices—presented a threat to its low-price image and its profits. The FTC determined that to eliminate this threat, Toys "R" Us used its dominant position as a toy distributor to extract parallel agreements from among ten principal toy manufacturers (such as Mattel, Hasbro, Fisher Price, Tyco, and Sega) to stop selling to warehouse clubs exactly the same toys that they sold to other toy distributors such as the clubs. The FTC explained that Toys "R" Us wanted "to prevent consumers from comparing the price and quality of products in the clubs to the price and quality of the same toys displayed and sold at Toys "R" Us, and thereby to reduce the effectiveness of the clubs as competitors."

The FTC found that Toys "R" Us also used the acquiescence of one manufacturer to obtain that of others, orchestrating a horizontal agreement among at least seven manufacturers to adhere to Toys "R" Us’s restrictions. The company also used the manufacturers to police one another. When one manufacturer complained that a competitor was selling to warehouse clubs, Toys "R" Us threatened to stop buying that competitor’s products and got its renewed acquiescence to the sales restrictions. The FTC found that the effect of the agreements was to eliminate competition that would have driven Toys "R" Us to lower its prices had Toys "R" Us not taken action to stifle the competitive threat posed by the clubs. The FTC concluded that "Toys "R" Us and its reluctant collaborators set out to eliminate from the marketplace a form of price competition and a style of service that increasing numbers of consumers preferred," and that Toys "R" Us’ had orchestrated a boycott that harmed the clubs, competition, and consumers without any "business justification for a boycott that had [such] a pronounced anticompetitive effect."&lt;ref&gt;''Toys “R” Us, Inc.'', 126 F.T.C. 415, 574–75 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In so ruling, the FTC emphasized that "key toy manufacturers were unwilling to refuse to sell to or discriminate against the clubs unless they were assured that their competitors would do the same,” and that Toy "R" Us "acted as the central player in the middle of what might be called a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, shuttling commitments back and forth between toy manufacturers and helping to hammer out points of shared understanding.”&lt;ref&gt;126 F.T.C. at 574.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit affirmed, comparing the case to ''Interstate Circuit''. The court emphasized FTC findings supporting a hub-and-spoke theory. For example, a Toys "R" Us official testified, "We made a point to tell each of the vendors that we spoke to that we would be talking to our other key suppliers." Mattel and Hasbro executives testified that they went along with "the special warehouse club policy (or, in the Commission's more pejorative language, boycott)" only "because our competitors had agreed" to it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11480829751523506812&amp;q=221+F.3d+928&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Toys “R” Us, Inc. v. FTC''], 221 F.3d 928, 932–33 (7th Cir. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit acknowledged that "there must be some evidence that tends to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently," but rejected the idea that "the Commission had to exclude all possibility that the manufacturers acted independently." But the FTC relied on evidence even more compelling than that in ''Interstate Circuit'' because it included direct communications and interdependence—the manufacturers testified that "the only condition on which each toy manufacturer would agree to [the boycott] demands was if it could be sure its competitors were doing the same thing." And "as is classically true in such cartels," the court said, "they were willing to do so only if TRU could protect them against cheaters."&lt;ref&gt;221 F.3d at 934-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dickson v. Microsoft===

In ''Dickson v. Microsoft Corp.'', the plaintiffs unsuccessfully argued that Microsoft had engaged in a hub-and-spoke conspiracy with three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)—Compaq, Dell, and PB Electronics—to restrain trade, in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, in the sale of operating systems, word processing, and spreadsheet software, and also a conspiracy to maintain Microsoft's alleged monopolies in the same  markets, in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. The alleged conspiracy was a set of similar licensing agreements in which the licensees agreed: (1) not to remove icons, folders, or Start menu entries from the Windows desktop; (2) not to modify the initial Windows boot sequence; (3) to integrate Microsoft's Internet browser software Internet Explorer (IE) and other application software with Microsoft's operating system software; and (4) to long-term distribution contracts, exclusive dealing distribution arrangements, and per-processor license fees. In exchange, the OEM defendants received various benefits, including discounts on software and "greater cooperation from Microsoft in product development." The OEMs also gained various competitive advantages in selling computer hardware. The district court held that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and dismissed the case. An appeal to the Fourth Circuit followed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6381104972216483819&amp;q=309+F.3d+193&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Dickson v. Microsoft Corp.''], 309 F.3d 193, 198–200 (4th Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Circuit said that the allegations described a "rimless wheel" conspiracy or a hub-and-spoke conspiracy. Citing ''Kotteakos'', the court stated, "A rimless wheel conspiracy is one in which various defendants enter into separate agreements with a common defendant, but where the defendants have no connection with one another, other than the common defendant's involvement in each transaction." That is a hub-and-spoke conspiracy "without the rim of the wheel to enclose the spokes." The court added, "In ''Kotteakos'', the Supreme Court made clear that a rimless wheel conspiracy is not a single, general conspiracy but instead amounts to multiple conspiracies between the common defendant and each of the other defendants." Thus, the hub-and-spoke conspiracy claim failed. The claim of separate vertical conspiracies, however, potentially survived a motion to dismiss.&lt;ref&gt;309 F.3d at 203-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourth Circuit dismissed the complaint, however, on other grounds, including insufficient likelihood of substantial anticompetitive effects.

A dissenting judge distinguished ''Kotteakos'' from this case and would have found a sufficient allegation of a conspiracy. The missing element in ''Kotteakos'' was interdependence; each of the other defendants used Brown's services independently of every other defendant's use. The rimless conspiracy pleaded here had as its elements: (1) an overall unlawful plan; (2) knowledge that others must be involved is inferable to each member, because of his knowledge of the unlawful nature of the subject of the conspiracy, but knowledge on the part of each member of the exact scope of the operation or the number of people involved is not required; and (3) each alleged co-conspirator participated in some way. The dissent argued that the allegations were that "each OEM joined a conspiracy which it knew was, by its nature, broader than just itself and Microsoft." The dissent said this satisfied the Supreme Court's language on hub-and-spoke conspiracy in ''Interstate Circuit'' ("[I]t is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be and often is formed without simultaneous action or agreement on the part of the conspirators") and ''Masonite'' ("Here, as in ''Interstate Circuit'', .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [i]t was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it.").&lt;ref&gt;309 F.3d at 216-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PepsiCo v. Coca-Cola===

In ''PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co.'', the Second Circuit rejected PepsiCo's claim that it had shown a hub-and-spoke conspiracy that Coca-Cola put together with independent food service distributors ("IFDs"), prohibiting the IFDs from delivering PepsiCo products to any of their customers. Coca-Cola had a "loyalty program" that provided that IFDs who supply customers with Coca-Cola may not "handle [&amp;#8239;] the soft drink products" of PepsiCo, under penalty of termination. PepsiCo had sued Coca-Cola, charging that the enforcement of the program violated Sherman Act § 1's per se rule against boycotts, but the court granted summary judgment because it found that PepsiCo failed to prove a horizontal agreement among IFDs to boycott PepsiCo. PepsiCo offered no evidence of direct communications among the IFDs; it offered only to prove that Coca-Cola assured the IFDs that the loyalty policy would be uniformly enforced and encouraged them to report violations. The Second Circuit said, "We agree with the district court that this was insufficient evidence of a horizontal agreement to withstand summary judgment."&lt;ref&gt;''PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co.'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3157695759800147418&amp;q=315+F.3d+101&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 315 F.3d 101, 109–11 (2d Cir. 2002).]&lt;/ref&gt;

PepsiCo argued that it had shown a per se illegal hub-and-spoke conspiracy. But the Second Circuit said the cases on which PepsiCo relied were price-fixing hub-and-spoke cases, such as ''Interstate Circuit'' and ''Parke, Davis'', which were based on ''per se'' illegal conduct. But vertical exclusive dealing agreements are not ''per se'' illegal, so that hub-and-spoke conspiracies to establish exclusive dealing are mot ''per se'' illegal. To be ''per se'' illegal as a boycott, the IFDs must agree together not to deal with PepsiCo. "A horizontal agreement is a prerequisite in a group boycott case."&lt;ref&gt;315 F.3d at 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it did not say so, the court apparently thought PepsiCo had shown merely a rimless wheel.

===Apple (eBook Case)===

In ''United States v. Apple, Inc.'' (the ''eBook'' case), Apple decided to enter the electronic book business, which was dominated by Amazon, which sold about 90% of the ebooks of the six major U.S. publishers. Apple persuaded five of these Big 6 publishers to enter into agency distribution agreements with it as principal and them as agent. The agreements set prices, and the publishers raised their prices. Apple had established a cartel for the publishers. The district court found a hub-and-spoke price-fixing conspiracy and the Second Circuit affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Apple Inc.'', 952 F. Supp. 2d 638, 694–695 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff'd, 791 F.3d 290, 313–14 (2d Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Apple unsuccessfully argued that the ''per se'' rule should not apply to a hub-and-spoke price-fixing conspiracy because it was "vertical."

===Guitar Center===

In the ''Guitar Center'' case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FCO%2020150825175/IN%20RE%20MUSICAL%20INSTRUMENTS%20&amp;%20EQUIP.%20ANTITRUST%20LITIGATION ''In re Musical Instruments and Equip. Antitrust Litig. (Guitar Center)''], 798 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Ninth Circuit considered an alleged hub-and-spoke conspiracy case similar to ''Klor's'' and ''Interstate Circuit'', but the court (2-1) found it implausible that the spokes conspired rather than merely acting independently in a parallel fashion. Guitar Center, the largest retail seller of musical instruments in the United States, accounted for about a third of all U.S. retail sales of guitars and guitar amplifiers. It was alleged that Guitar Center, a trade association of music retailers, and the five major manufacturers of guitars and guitar amplifiers conspired to set minimum prices at which any retailer could advertise the manufacturers' guitars and guitar amplifiers, in violation of the antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d 1189-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court dismissed the federal antitrust claim on the pleadings.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Nat'l Ass'n of Music Merchs., No. MDL No. 2121, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118827 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the court conceded that "the line between horizontal and vertical restraints can blur," and a "conspiracy can involve both direct competitors and actors up and down the supply chain, and hence consist of both horizontal and vertical agreements," as in a hub-and-spoke conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1192.&lt;/ref&gt; The court saw the key question before it as "whether plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to provide a plausible basis from which we can infer the alleged [manufacturers' horizontal] agreements' existence.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1193.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The court noted "one key difference between a rimless hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of purely vertical agreements) and a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of vertical agreements joined by horizontal agreements)." The key difference was that "courts analyze vertical agreements under the rule of reason, whereas horizontal agreements are violations per se." The court then commented on the plaintiffs' motives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This distinction provides strong incentives for plaintiffs to plead a horizontal conspiracy (either alone or as part of a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy). The prospect of establishing a violation per se is much more appealing to plaintiffs than the potential difficulty and costliness of proving a § 1 claim under the rule of reason.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1192 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The plaintiffs relied on proof of the manufacturers' parallel conduct (they adopted the minimum price policy at about the same time) together with some so-called plus factors. The claim that the manufacturers' conduct was interdependent—that is, it would succeed only if they all did the same thing as appropriate united front—was not enough, the court said, because "companies base their actions in part on the anticipated reactions of their competitors. And because of this mutual awareness, two firms may arrive at identical decisions independently, as they are cognizant of—and reacting to—similar market pressures."&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1193.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of plus factors is therefore critical. The court listed the plaintiffs' alleged plus factors—"economic actions and outcomes that are largely inconsistent with unilateral conduct but largely consistent with explicitly coordinated action"—that could make the manufacturers' parallel action appear to be the result of agreement, but dismissed each as insufficiently persuasive:
* defendants shared a common motive to conspire, but the court said that interdependent firms may engage in consciously parallel conduct through observation of their competitors' decisions, even absent an agreement;
* the manufacturers acted against their individual self-interest, but the court said that a firm can risk being the first to raise prices, confident that if its price is followed, all firms will benefit, and if they don’t follow the leader the firm can always drop the price back to avoid loss of market share; furthermore, that the manufacturers all responded to Guitar Center's pressure, heeding similar demands made by a common, important customer, does not suggest ''horizontal'' conspiracy or collusion, just self-interested independent parallel conduct in an interdependent market;
* the manufacturers simultaneously adopted substantially similar price policies, but the court said that simultaneity does not reveal anything more than similar reaction to similar pressures within an interdependent market;
* the FTC investigated the trade association defendant for the same practices, sued it, and the association accepted a consent decree, but the court said that did not prove a conspiracy occurred;
* the defendant manufacturers participated in the trade association's meetings urging adoption of the challenged pricing policy, but the court said listening to advocacy does not show an agreement; and 
* retail prices for guitars and guitar amplifiers rose during the class period as the number of units sold fell, but the court said a price increase is no more suggestive of collusion than it is of any other potential cause.
In the Ninth Circuit's view, all this showed was that "Guitar Center used its substantial market power to pressure each manufacturer to adopt similar policies, and each manufacturer adopted those policies as in its own interest."&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1195-98.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One judge dissented. He pointed out that "although the majority opinion purports to address the six plus factors as a whole, it actually focuses on each factor individually." In his view, "When truly analyzed together, the six plus factors strongly suggest that the manufacturer defendants reached an illegal horizontal agreement, which 'nudge' plaintiffs' allegations 'from conceivable to  plausible.'&amp;#8239;"&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1198-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

● Professor Orbach asserts that in the ''Guitar Center'' case "the Ninth Circuit made the error of trying to break the alleged conspiracy 'into its constituent parts, the respective vertical and horizontal agreements.'&amp;#8239;" Since this was a dismissal on the pleadings, the court's analysis "demand[s] that plaintiffs offer at the pleading stage evidence of direct horizontal coordination," which is a heavy burden. The result is that the court provides "a free pass to hub-and-spoke conspiracies where vertical communications may have dispensed with the need for such horizontal coordination."&lt;ref&gt; Barak Orbach, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/antitrust_source/apr16_orbach_4_11f.authcheckdam.pdf '' Hub-and-Spoke Conspiracies''], {{smallcaps|the antitrust source}} 1, 11 (April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kingdom of Bohemia during the Hussite Wars.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] during the [[Hussite Wars]]. The movement began in [[Prague]] and quickly spread south and then through the rest of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. Eventually, it expanded into the remaining domains of the Bohemian Crown as well.|alt=]]
{{Protestantism}}
The '''Hussites''' ({{lang-cs|Husité}} or ''Kališníci''; "Chalice People") were a pre-[[Protestant]] [[Christian movement]] that followed the teachings of Czech reformer [[Jan Hus]], who became the best known representative of the [[Bohemian Reformation]]. 

The Hussite movement began in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and quickly spread throughout the remaining [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]], including [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]]. It also made inroads into the northern parts of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]), but was rejected and gained infamy for the plundering behavior of the Hussite soldiers.&lt;ref name='Spiesz 52'&gt;Spiesz ''et al.'' 2006, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bartl 2002, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Kirschbaum 2005 48'&gt;Kirschbaum 2005, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spiesz ''et al.'' 2006, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also very small temporary communities in [[Polish–Lithuanian union|Poland-Lithuania]] and [[Transylvania]] which moved to Bohemia after being confronted with religious intolerance. It was a regional movement that failed to expand anywhere farther. Hussites emerged as a majority [[Utraquist]] movement with a significant [[Taborite]] faction, and smaller regional ones that included [[Adamites]], [[Orebites]] and [[Sirotci|Orphans]]. Major Hussite theologians included [[Petr Chelcicky]], [[Jerome of Prague]], and others. A number of Czech national heroes were Hussite, including [[Jan Zizka]], who led a fierce resistance to five consecutive crusades proclaimed on Hussite Bohemia by the [[Papacy]]. Hussites were one of the most important forerunners of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. This predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened [[Czechs|Czech]] national awareness.

After the [[Council of Constance]] lured Jan Hus in with a letter of indemnity, then tried him for heresy and put him to death at the stake on 6 July 1415,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article "Constance, Council of"&lt;/ref&gt; the Hussites fought the [[Hussite Wars]] (1420–1434) for their religious and political cause. After the [[Hussite Wars]] ended, the [[Catholic]]-supported [[Utraquist]] side came out victorious from conflict with the [[Taborites]] and became the most common representation of the Hussite faith in Bohemia. Catholics and Utraquists were emancipated in Bohemia after the [[religious peace of Kutná Hora]] in 1485.

[[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], or what is now the territory of the [[Czech Republic]], remained majority Hussite for two centuries until [[Roman Catholicism]] was reimposed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] after the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Due to this event and centuries of [[Habsburg]] persecution, Hussite traditions are merely represented in the [[Moravian Church]], [[Unity of the Brethren]], and the refounded [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church|Czechoslovak Hussite]] churches among present-day [[Christians]].&lt;ref name="Nĕmec"&gt;Nĕmec, Ludvík "The Czechoslovak heresy and schism: the emergence of a national Czechoslovak church," American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1975, {{ISBN|0-87169-651-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hussites.gif|thumb|right|200px|Evolution of the Hussite movement in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] from 1419 to 1620, superimposed on modern borders]]

The arrest of Hus in 1414 caused considerable resentment in [[Czech lands]]. The authorities of both countries appealed urgently and repeatedly to [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] to release Jan Hus.

When news of his death at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 arrived, disturbances broke out, directed primarily against the [[clergy]] and especially against the monks. Even the Archbishop narrowly escaped from the effects of this popular anger. The treatment of Hus was felt to be a disgrace inflicted upon the whole country and his death was seen as a criminal act. King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], prompted by his grudge against Sigismund, at first gave free vent to his indignation at the course of events in [[Constance]]. His wife openly favoured the friends of Hus. Avowed Hussites stood at the head of the government.

A league was formed by certain lords,{{Who|date=April 2011}} who pledged themselves to protect the free preaching of the Gospel upon all their possessions and estates and to obey the power of the Bishops only where their orders accorded with the injunctions of the [[Bible]]. The university would arbitrate any disputed points. The entire Hussite nobility joined the league. Other than verbal protest of the council's treatment of Hus, there was little evidence of any actions taken by the nobility until 1417. At that point several of the lesser nobility and some barons, signatories of the 1415 protest letter, removed Romanist priests from their parishes, replacing them with priests willing to give communion in both wine and bread. The chalice of wine became the central identifying symbol of the Hussite movement.&lt;ref&gt;John Klassen, The Nobility and the Making of the Hussite Revolution(East European Quarterly/Columbia University Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; If the king had joined, its resolutions would have received the sanction of the law; but he refused, and approached the newly formed Roman Catholic League of lords, whose members pledged themselves to support the king, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], and the Council. The prospect of a civil war began to emerge.

[[Pope Martin V]] as Cardinal Otto of [[Colonna]] had attacked Hus with relentless severity. He energetically resumed the battle against Hus's teaching after the enactments of the [[Council of Constance]]. He wished to eradicate completely the doctrine of Hus, for which purpose the co-operation of King Wenceslaus had to be obtained.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In 1418, Sigismund succeeded in winning his brother over to the standpoint of the council by pointing out the inevitability of a religious war if the [[Christian heresy|heretics]] in Bohemia found further protection.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Hussite statesmen and army leaders had to leave the country and Roman Catholic priests were reinstated. These measures caused a general commotion which hastened the death of King Wenceslaus by a paralytic stroke in 1419.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} His heir was Sigismund.

==Factions of the Hussites==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
[[Image:Jagiełło dispute.JPG|right|thumb|Hussite theologians dispute in the presence of King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] of Poland]]
Hussitism organised itself during the years 1415–1419. From the beginning, there formed two parties, with a smaller number of people withdrawing from both parties around the pacifist [[Petr Chelčický]], whose teachings would form the foundation of the [[Unitas Fratrum]].

The moderate party, who followed Hus more closely, sought to conduct reform while leaving the whole hierarchical and liturgical order of the Church untouched.

The more radical party{{clarify|date=May 2014}}&lt;!--Did this party have a name? If so, it would be good to use it here and elsewhere to keep all these parties clear in the (average) reader's mind. It's really not clear how many parties there were or what they were.--&gt; identified itself more boldly with the doctrines of [[John Wycliffe]], sharing his passionate hatred of the [[monasticism|monastic]] clergy, and his desire to return the Church to its supposed condition during the time of the apostles. This required the removal of the existing hierarchy and the secularisation of ecclesiastical possessions. The radicals preached the ''"sufficientia legis Christi"''—the divine law (i.e. the [[Bible]]) is the sole rule and canon for human society, not only in the church, but also in political and civil matters. They rejected therefore, as early as 1416, everything that they believed had no basis in the Bible, such as the [[veneration]] of saints and images, [[fasting|fasts]], superfluous holidays, the oath, intercession for the dead, auricular [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[indulgence]]s, the sacraments of [[Confirmation]] and the [[Anointing of the Sick]]; they admitted laymen and women{{citation needed|reason=women in preachers office|date=August 2015}} to the preacher's office, and chose their own priests. But above all they clung to Wycliffe's doctrine of the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], denying [[transubstantiation]], and this is the principal point by which they are distinguished from the moderate party.

===Four Articles of Prague===
The programme of the more conservative Hussites (the moderate party)&lt;!--"The moderate party" was added to make it clear which of the two parties this was. If "the more conservative Hussites" was NOT the moderate party, then something needs to be made clearer.--&gt; is contained in the Four Articles of [[Prague]], which were written by Jakoubek ze Stříbra and agreed upon in July 1420, promulgated in the [[Latin]], [[Czech language|Czech]], and [[German language|German]] languages.&lt;ref name="global.britannica.com"&gt;http://global.britannica.com/topic/Four-Articles-of-Prague&lt;/ref&gt; The full text is about two pages long, but they are often summarized as:&lt;ref name="global.britannica.com"/&gt;

*Freedom to preach the word of God
*Celebration of the [[communion under both kinds]] (bread and wine to priests and  [[laity]] alike)
*Poverty of the clergy and expropriation of church property;
*Punishment for  [[mortal sins]] regardless of stature.

===Calixtines (or Utraquists) and Taborites===

|caption2=[[Jan Žižka]] leading troops of [[Radical Hussites]]}}
The views of the moderate Hussites were widely represented at the University and among the citizens of Prague; they were therefore called the Prague Party, but also Calixtines (Latin ''calix'' chalice) or [[Utraquists]] (Latin ''utraque'' both), because they emphasized the second article of Prague, and the chalice became their emblem.

The radicals (the radical party) had their gathering-places all around the country. Their first armed assault fell on the small town of Ústí, on the river Lužnice, south of Prague (today's [[Sezimovo Ústí]]). However, as the place did not prove to be defensible, they settled in the remains of an older town upon a hill not far away and founded a new town, which they named [[Tábor]] (after the traditional name of the mountain on which Jesus was expected to return; see [[Mark 13]]); hence they were called Táborité ([[Taborite]]s). They comprised the essential force of the radical Hussites. Their aim was to destroy the enemies of the law of God, and to defend his kingdom (which had been expected to come in a short time) by the sword. Their end-of-world visions did not come true. In order to preserve their settlement and spread their ideology, they waged bloody wars; in the beginning they observed a strict regime, inflicting the severest punishment equally for murder, as for less severe faults as adultery, perjury and [[usury]], and also tried to apply rigid Biblical standards to the social order of the time. The Taborites usually had the support of the [[Orebites]] (later called Orphans), an eastern Bohemian sect of Hussitism based in [[Hradec Králové]].

Hussites were not a unitary movement, but a diverse one with multiple factions that held different views and opposed each other in the [[Hussite Wars]].

Hussites can be divided into:

*[[Moderate Hussites]]
**[[Prague Hussites]]
**[[Bohemian nobility|Bohemian Hussite nobility]]
**[[Hussites of Žatec and Louny]]
**other [[Utraquists]]/[[Calixtines]]
*[[Radical Hussites]]
**[[Taborites]] 
**[[Orebites]]
**[[Adamites]]
**[[Sirotci|Orphans]]
**[[Unity of the Brethren]] (founded in the middle 15th century)
**other Radical Hussites

==History==
===Hussite Wars (1419–1434)===
{{Main article|Hussite Wars}}
[[Image:Ussita pavese shield Prag Museum 1429.jpg|right|thumb|Recreation of Hussite [[pavise]] from an original in the [[National Museum (Prague)|Museum of Prague]]]]
[[File:Husité - Jenský kodex.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of battle between mounted knights|Battle between Hussites and Catholic [[crusade]]rs; Jena Codex, 15th century]]
The news of the death of King Wenceslaus in 1419 produced a great commotion among the people of Prague. A revolution swept over the country: churches and monasteries were destroyed, and church property was seized by the Hussite nobility. It was then, and remained till much later, in question whether Bohemia was a hereditary or an elective monarchy, especially as the line through which Sigismund claimed the throne had accepted that the Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy elected by the nobles, and thus the regent of the kingdom (Čeněk of Wartenberg) also explicitly stated that Sigismund had not been elected as reason for Sigismund's claim to not be accepted. Sigismund could get possession of "his" kingdom only by force of arms. Pope Martin V called upon Catholics of the West to take up arms against the Hussites, declaring a crusade, and there followed twelve years of [[Hussite Wars|warfare]].

The Hussites initially campaigned defensively, but after 1427 they assumed the offensive. Apart from their religious aims, they fought for the national interests of the Czechs. The moderate and radical parties were united, and they not only repelled the attacks of the army of [[crusade]]rs but crossed the borders into neighboring countries. On March 23, 1430, [[Joan of Arc]] dictated a letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.joan-of-arc.org/joanofarc_letter_march_23_1430.html Joan of Arc Letter of March 23, 1430]&lt;/ref&gt; that threatened to lead a crusading army against the Hussites unless they returned to the Catholic faith, but her capture by English and Burgundian troops two months later would keep her from carrying out this threat.

====The Council of Basel and Compacta of Prague====
{{main|Council of Basel|Basel Compacts}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Eventually, the opponents of the Hussites found themselves forced to consider an amicable settlement. They invited a Bohemian embassy to appear at the [[Council of Basel]]. The discussions began on 10 January 1432, centering chiefly on the four articles of [[Prague]]. No agreement emerged. After repeated negotiations between the Basel Council and Bohemia, a Bohemian–Moravian state assembly in Prague accepted the ''"Compacta"'' of Prague on 30 November 1433. The agreement granted communion in both kinds to all who desired it, but with the understanding that Christ was entirely present in each kind. Free preaching was granted conditionally: the Church hierarchy had to approve and place priests, and the power of the bishop must be considered. The article which prohibited the secular power of the clergy was almost reversed.

The Taborites refused to conform. The Calixtines united with the Roman Catholics and destroyed the Taborites at the [[Battle of Lipany]] on (30 May 1434). From that time, the Taborites lost their importance, though the Hussite movement would continue in [[Poland]] for another five years, until the Royalist forces of Poland defeated the Polish Hussites at the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. The state assembly of [[Jihlava]] in 1436 confirmed the ''"Compacta"'' and gave them the sanction of law. This accomplished the reconciliation of Bohemia with Rome and the Western Church, and at last Sigismund obtained possession of the Bohemian crown. His reactionary measures caused a ferment in the whole country, but he died in 1437. The state assembly in Prague rejected Wyclif's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which was obnoxious to the [[Utraquists]], as heresy in 1444. Most of the Taborites now went over to the party of the Utraquists; the rest joined the "Brothers of the Law of Christ" ({{lang-la|"Unitas Fratrum"}}) (see [[Unity of the Brethren]]; also [[Bohemian Brethren]] and [[Moravian Church]]).

[[File:Stevens P. Maria Vítězná.jpg|thumb|Painting celebrating the Catholic victory at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620). In the coming years, [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Margraviate of Moravia|Moravia]] were [[Counter-Reformation|forcibly converted]] from [[Hussitism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]] by the [[Habsburgs]].]]
In 1462, [[Pope Pius II]] declared the ''"Compacta"'' null and void, prohibited communion in both kinds, and acknowledged King [[George of Podebrady]] as king on condition that he would promise an unconditional harmony with the Roman Church. This he refused, but his successor, King [[Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], favored the Roman Catholics and proceeded against some zealous clergymen of the Calixtines. The troubles of the Utraquists increased from year to year. In 1485, at the [[Religious peace of Kutná Hora|Diet of Kutná Hora]], an agreement was made between the Roman Catholics and Utraquists that lasted for thirty-one years. It was only later, at the Diet of 1512, that the equal rights of both religions were permanently established. The appearance of [[Martin Luther]] was hailed by the Utraquist clergy, and Luther himself was astonished to find so many points of agreement between the doctrines of Hus and his own. But not all Utraquists approved of the German [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; a schism arose among them, and many returned to the Roman doctrine, while other elements had organised the ''"[[Unitas Fratrum]]"'' already in 1457.

===Bohemian Revolt and harsh persecution under the Habsburgs (1618–1918)===
{{main|Bohemian Revolt|Battle of the White Mountain|Thirty Years' War|Counter-Reformation|Anti-Protestantism|History of the Moravian Church}}
Under Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]], the Bohemian state assembly established the ''"[[Confessio Bohemica]]"'', upon which Lutherans, Reformed, and Bohemian Brethren agreed. From that time forward Hussitism began to die out. After the [[Battle of the White Mountain|Battle of White Mountain]] on 8 November 1620 the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Faith]] was re-established with vigour, which fundamentally changed the religious conditions of the [[Czech lands]].

Leaders and members of [[Unitas Fratrum]] were forced to choose to either leave the many and varied southeastern principalities of what was the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (mainly [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and parts of Germany and its many states), or to practice their beliefs secretly. As a result, members were forced underground and dispersed across northwestern Europe. The largest remaining communities of the Brethren were located in Lissa ([[Leszno]]) in Poland, which had historically strong ties with the Czechs, and in small, isolated groups in Moravia. Some, among them [[Jan Amos Comenius]], fled to western Europe, mainly the [[Low Countries]]. A settlement of Hussites in [[Herrnhut]], Saxony, now Germany, in 1722 caused the emergence of the [[Moravian Church]].

===Post-Habsburg era and modern times (1918–present)===
{{main|Moravian Church|Unity of the Brethren|Czechoslovak Hussite Church}}
In 1918, as a result of [[World War I]], the [[Czech lands]] regained independence from [[Austria-Hungary]] controlled by the [[Habsburg monarchy]] as [[Czechoslovakia]].

Today, the [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] claims to be the modern successor of the Hussite tradition.&lt;ref name="Nĕmec"/&gt;

'''John Lewis''' (1 February 1889&amp;nbsp;– 12 February 1976) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister and [[Marxist philosopher]] and author of many works on [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[religion]].

Lewis's father, a successful builder and [[architect]], came from a [[Wales|Welsh]] farming family, and was a very devout [[Methodist]]. Young Lewis's social and political views clashed with those of his father. Their quarrels eventually led to his father [[Inheritance|disinheriting]] him.

==Education and religious work==
Lewis attended [[Dulwich College]] and [[University College London]], where he earned his B.Sc. Having been raised a Methodist, he soon left that church to become a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]]. He studied for the ministry at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and in 1916 was appointed to a [[Presbyterian]] church in [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]]; in 1924, he moved to a church in [[Birmingham]]. He earned his Ph.D. in philosophy from the [[University of Birmingham]],  specialising in the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]], and becoming a Marxist himself.

By 1929, his left wing views were too strong for the church he was in and he moved to [[Ipswich]] as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister. Here, his leftist political sermons attracted a large youth following, but upset a group of older, more conservative members. Their complaints led Lewis to offer his resignation, to be put to a vote of the membership. In a packed and charged meeting, he received the support of the majority of church members.

==Political and social activism==
Lewis participated in anti-war political activity starting in 1916. On one occasion, he had to be rescued from an angry crowd. He also became involved in work to support the unemployed, and served on the local [[Trades Union Congress|Trades Union Council]]. On one occasion, at Christmas, he led a group of unemployed men who marched to the Town Hall, where the Mayor was holding his formal Christmas dinner. They walked in and sat down, demanding to join the feast.

He also was involved with the [[The Scout Association|Boy Scout]] movement, running a Scout troop, and authoring training booklets. He acted as a guide for outdoor holidays organised by the [[Thomas Arthur Leonard|Holiday Fellowship]]. He often went to [[Switzerland]], and took parties up the [[Matterhorn]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 General Election]] he stood unsuccessfully as [[UK Labour Party|Labour]] candidate for [[Great Yarmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Yarmouth]].

==Leftist politics==
The [[Bolshevik Revolution]] had a great effect on Lewis, and he studied [[Russian language|Russian]]. He became a [[Christian Socialist]], and later a [[Marxism|Marxist]].

In 1936 the [[Left Book Club]], started by the publisher [[Victor Gollancz]], was very popular. Lewis quit his ministry in Ipswich to take on the task of building a national network of discussion groups. The groups brought together in a progressive movement intelligent, literate people who had not found rewarding political action in leftwing parties. Soon there were groups in every town. In effect, the Left Book Club and its groups had become a quasi-political party.

He also became the editor of the British Marxist journal, ''[[Modern Quarterly (British journal)|Modern Quarterly]]'', from 1946-1953. He was very interested in polemical writing, and authored many books and articles in a polemical vein on topics of philosophy, social issues, and Marxism. In one exchange of polemics, he took on the [[France|French]] Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]. Althusser's part of the exchange is the article "Reply to John Lewis".

"Reply to John Lewis" first appeared, translated by Grahame Lock, in two numbers of the theoretical and political journal of the Communist Party of Great Britain, ''[[Marxism Today]]'', in October and November 1972. As Althusser himself noted: " "Reply": because, a few months earlier (in its January and February numbers of 1972), the same journal had published a long critical article by John Lewis (a British Communist philosopher known for his interventions in political-ideological questions) under the title: "The Althusser Case"."&lt;ref&gt;This article was republished by Althusser in his ''Essays in Self-Criticism'', now available in an [http://www.marx2mao.com/Other/ESC76NB.html online version].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==
During [[World War II]] Lewis was a lecturer for the British Army, working with the [[Army Education Corps]] and the [[Army Bureau of Current Affairs]] and lecturing on, among other things, Britain's wartime ally, the [[Soviet Union]].

He also taught at several different schools, including a stint teaching biology at [[Morley College]], an adult education college in London.

'''Joseph A. Bracken''', [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] is an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[theologian]]. Bracken is a proponent of [[process philosophy]] and [[process theology]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]]. Much of his work is devoted to a synthesis of revealed religion and Christian [[Trinity|trinitarian]] doctrines with a revised process theology. Bracken introduced a [[Field theory (psychology)|field theoretic]] approach to process metaphysics.

==Life==
Bracken was born on 22 March 1930 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="resume"&gt;[http://www.xavier.edu/_application/media/faculty/Bracken%202010.pdf Curriculum vitae at Xavier University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bracken is Emeritus Professor of Theology at [[Xavier University]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]]. He received his PhD from the [[University of Freiburg]] in Germany in 1968, and taught at [[University of Saint Mary of the Lake]] Mundelein Seminary in Illinois (1968–1974), and at [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] (1974–1982), before becoming Chairman of the Theology Department at Xavier in 1982.&lt;ref name=resume/&gt;

==Work==
Bracken is the author and/or editor of 11 books and wrote about 150 articles in academic journals.&lt;ref name=resume/&gt;

He brief summarized his approach in a book review in 2007: ''This is why in my own rethinking of Whitehead's metaphysics I presumed from the start that his metaphysical categories needed revision in order to accommodate Christian belief in God as Trinity. With this in mind, I soon realized that Whitehead's key category of "society" needed further development. A "society," after all, must be more than an aggregate of actual occasions with a "common element of form" (PR 1968, 34) if philosophical atomism is to be avoided. My own solution was to reinterpret a Whiteheadian society as an enduring structured field of activity for successive generations of constituent actual occasions. Thus understood, a Whiteheadian "society" serves both to legitimate a trinitarian process-oriented understanding of God and to make Whitehead's philosophy an even stronger social ontology than he himself envisioned. That is, "the final real things of which the world is made up" are not simply actual occasions but the societies into which they spontaneously aggregate.''&lt;ref&gt;Bracken, J. A. 2007.

A '''lock of hair''' is a piece or pieces of [[hair]] that has been cut from, or remains singly on, a human head, most commonly bunched or tied together in some way. A standard dictionary definition defines a lock as a tress, curl, or ringlet of hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/lock|title=the definition of lock|last=Dictionary.com Unabridged|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolic value==
[[File:Locks of hair of Percy Bysshe Shelley and of Mary Shelley (19th C) - BL Ashley MS 5022.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Preserved locks of the hair of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy]] and [[Mary Shelley]], now in the [[British Library]].]]
Locks of hair carry [[symbol]]ic value and have been utilized throughout history in various [[religion|religious]], [[superstition|superstitious]], and sentimental roles.
* A primitive belief maintains that owning a lock of hair from another's head gives one power over that individual, in the same manner that owning a piece of clothing or image of an individual grants the owner such powers.
* Historically, giving a lock of one's hair to someone has been considered a sign of love and devotion, especially before an impending separation. It is still a popular trope in fiction, particularly the romance genre.
* During [[ancient history|antiquity]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] girls who were about to be married offered locks of hair to [[Jove]] (Jupiter) in his forest god aspect, [[Virbius]] (Virbio).
* An ancient and worldwide (e.g. China, Egypt, Thailand, Albania, Ukraine, India, Israel, etc.) pre-adolescent custom was to shave children's heads but leave a lock of hair (sometimes several locks) remaining on their heads. Upon reaching adulthood the lock of hair was usually cut off (see [[Rites of passage]]).
* The scalplock was a lock of hair kept throughout a man's life. Like [[childhood]] locks, the scalplock was also a worldwide phenomenon, particularly noted amongst eastern woodland Native American tribes (see [[Iroquois]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Mahican]], [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]]) in North America (see also [[Scalping]] and [[Mohawk hairstyle]]).
* [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] was reported to have worn a scalp lock according to [[Leo the Deacon]], a [[Byzantine]] historian. Later [[Ukrainian Cossacks]] ([[Zaporozhians]]) sported scalplocks called [[oseledets]] or [[khokhol]]. In India this custom remains active but usually only amongst [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Hindus]]. See [[Sikha]].
* In [[Mark Twain]]'s travel book ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'', he describes [[Morocco|Moroccan]] men sporting scalp locks.&lt;ref&gt;The Innocents Abroad, or The New Pilgrims' Progress, Mark Twain, 1869&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Riffian people|Riffian]] ([[Berber people|Berber]]) men of [[Morocco]] had the custom of shaving the head but leaving a single lock of hair on either the crown, left, or right side of the head, so that the angel [[Azrael]] is able "...to pull them up to heaven of the Last Day."&lt;ref&gt;El Maghreg: 1200 Miles' Ride Through Morocco, Hugh Edward Millington Stutfield&lt;/ref&gt;
* A common superstition holds that a lock of hair from a baby's first [[haircut]] should be kept for good luck.
*An old [[Ireland|Irish]] superstition holds that it is unlucky to accept a lock of hair (or a four-footed beast) from a lover.
* A lock of [[Beethoven]]'s hair, cut from his head in 1827, was auctioned in 1994 through [[Sotheby's]] of [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lock of hair makes its way through history |url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/001103/hair.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610014339/http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/001103/hair.shtml |newspaper=Jewish News of Greater Phoenix |archive-date=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on the hair determined that the composer's lifelong illness was caused by [[lead poisoning]].
* A [[Polish plait]] (Koltun in Polish, meaning "Knot", but often referred to in English as an "[[Elf]]-Lock") is a lock of matted hair similar to a [[dreadlock]]. Due to a scalp disease ([[Plica polonica]]), King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] (1577–1648) had a Polish plait hanging from the left side of his head which in an engraved portrait in the [[Royal Collection]] is adorned by a large pearl. His courtiers were said to have adopted the hairstyle in order to flatter the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RCIN 612170 - Christianvs Qvartvs dei Gratia Daniae, Norwegiae |website=[[Royal Collection]] |url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/themes/trails/engraved-royal-portraits/christian-iv-king-of-denmark |access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to superstitious beliefs, the Polish plait used to be particularly common in Poland (hence its name). Initially, the plait was treated as an amulet, supposed to bring good health, as the plait was supposed to take the illness "out" of the body, and therefore it was rarely cut off.
*A [[lovelock (hair)|lovelock]] was popular amongst European "men of fashion" from the end of the 16th century until well into the 17th century. The lovelock was a long lock of usually plaited ([[braid]]ed) hair made to rest over the left shoulder (the heart side) to show devotion to a loved one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The sinister side: how left-right symbolism shaped Western art |first=James |last=Hall |page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, it was common for bereaved family members to keep locks of hair from deceased [[children]] or family members. These locks of hair were seen as mementos and served to comfort the surviving loved ones. These locks of hair were typically kept in [[locket]]s though small jars, and in some cases [[jewelry]].  Jewelry could include everything from bracelets, to earrings, as well as various types of brooches (see [[hair jewellery]]).

{{Theosophy}}
{{italic title}}
'''''Lotusblüthen''''' (1893-1900) and '''''New Lotusblüten''''' (1908-1913 (1914/15)) was a theosophical magazine published by [[Franz Hartmann]]. It was the [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|second theosophical magazine in Germany and Austria]] after [[Wilhelm Hübbe-Schleiden]]s ''Die Sphinx''.

==Lotusblüthen==
''Lotusblüthen'' was a monthly journal containing articles and selected translations. The first edition appeared in March 1893 in [[Leipzig]], the last in September 1900, thus there were altogether 96 editions. In each case six editions were bound to one booklet, i.e. editions January to June were combined into a large booklet, which appeared in each case in March, likewise editions July until Decembers with publication date in September. The format corresponded to today's DIN A 5. Franz Hartmann not only functioned as a publisher, but wrote also most of the published articles. The total number of pages of all editions during 1893 to 1900 was approx. 7300 pages, of this 6300 pages were written by Hartmann.

== New Lotusblüten ==
The new ''Lotusblüten'', (this time already written without "h"), was published after 1908. 
It was now a bimonthly journal, containing original articles and selected translations. The first edition appeared June/July 1908 in Leipzig and Berlin, the last probably in June/July 1913, thus altogether there were 36 (possibly also 42 or 48) editions. It is unsure if the magazine was published in 1914 and 1915. During the secured six years of existence of the magazine until 1913, the total number of pages was approximately 2400 pages. The edition of 1913, was published, because of Hartmann's death on 7 August 1912, by Paul Harald Grävell von Jostenoode (1856-1932).

The new ''Lotusblüten'' did not reach the same level of quality as the first ''Lotusblüthen''.

Numerous essays from the two magazines were published later in book form. So e.g.:

'''Manuel Sacristán Luzón''' (born [[Madrid]], 1925, died [[Barcelona]], 1985) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[philosopher]] and writer.

Sacristán, the son of a Francoist collaborator, moved to Barcelona in 1940, thereafter living most of his life in said city. He soon became a member of the [[Falange Española]] youth section and studied [[Law]] and [[Philosophy]] in the [[University of Barcelona]], where he became a member of the cultural section of the ''Sindicato Español Universitario'' (the Falangist student union). After a thwarted contact with a clandestine Anarchist group, he and two fellow Falangists were shunned and persecuted by the mainstream SEU officials, resulting in the suicide of one of them and an ultimately ineffectual death warrant on Sacristán.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circulobellasartes.com/ag_ediciones-minerva-LeerMinervaCompleto.php?art=60 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708154947/http://www.circulobellasartes.com/ag_ediciones-minerva-LeerMinervaCompleto.php?art=60 |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foroporlamemoria.info/documentos/2004/msacristan_02012005.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently moved to [[Münster]], in [[Westphalia]] ([[German Federal Republic]]) in order to study [[Mathematical Logic]] and the [[Philosophy of Science]] (1954–1956). He became not only an excellent logician, but also a convinced reflective [[Marxist]] thinker and [[communist]] leader. Again in Barcelona, he taught in the Faculties of Philosophy and Economics of the [[University of Barcelona]].

His academic career was fraught with difficulties. His political activity led him to the direction of the underground [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (PSUC) and he had a leading role in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] university movement. Due to his Marxist ideas, by which he was very influenced after his stay in Germany and which he introduced to Spain, he was expelled from the University in 1965. In 1966 he participated in the formation of the Barcelona Democratic Students’ Union. It was not until after Franco’s death with the restoration of democracy that he was again admitted. After having had to bear a bitter and humiliating period he was appointed professor of Methodology of Social Sciences at the University of Barcelona. During the academic year 1982-1983 he taught at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. It was in Mexico that he met Mª [[Ángeles Lizón]], from whom he never parted until his death.

From 1947 he was the creator and driving force behind different periodical publications of a political-cultural nature. Along with [[Juan Carlos García-Borrón]], he ran the magazine ''[[Qvadrante]]'', he was editor of the ''[[Laye]]'' magazine and ''[[Quaderns de Cultura]]'' (an underground PSUC journal ). He directed and collaborated in [[Nous Horitzons]], and in 1977 was a founder member of the magazine ''[[Materiales]]''. In 1979, in collaboration with [[Giulia Adinolfi]], he set up a new magazine, ''[[Mientras Tanto]]''. This aimed to reconsider communist-emancipationist ideology through [[political ecology|ecologist]] and [[feminist]] criticism and within the original Marxist matrix.

Throughout his life he was extremely active as editor and translator for different  publishing houses. He translated more than 80 works by several authors: most notably [[Mario Bunge]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Antonio Gramsci]] (who may be regarded as one of his main intellectual references), [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[György Lukács|Lukács]], [[Galvano Della Volpe]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith]], E. Fisher, [[Labriola]], [[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]], [[Ágnes Heller]], G. Markus, and [[E. P. Thompson]]. Of special interest among his work as an author are ''Introducción a la lógica y al análisis formal'' (Barcelona, Ariel, 1969) and numerous articles and short texts posthumously collected in several volumes of ''Panfletos y materiales'' (Barcelona, Icaria, 1983–1985).

In 1975 he began the project of publishing a critical edition in Spanish of the complete works of Marx and Engels in 68 volumes, under the imprint of Editorial Grijalbo. Only twelve of the volumes of this venture appeared, among them Sacristán’s translations of  ''[[Das Kapital]]'', books 1 and 2, and the ''[[Anti-Dühring]]''. Sacristán also edited and translated Antonio Gramsci’s anthology of texts in the publishing house Siglo XXI. His editorial work was always underpinned by a long and sustained commitment to research and teaching in the philosophical, methodological and critical-cultural fields, and a commitment to intervention in the ideological debate of his time.

His first contacts with the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) took place during his first stay in Germany. He was a clandestine member of the governing bodies of the PSUC and PCE, developing over many years an intense political activity, both at the university and on the cultural front. Since the May 1968 crisis (the events of [[May 1968 in France|May]] in Paris and the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]]), his differences with the official line of the PCC and PSUC led him to resign from nearly all his posts, though he stayed with the party until the end of the 1970s. It was not until 1979 that he declared publicly that he did not belong to any political party.

In 1978 he joined the Antinuclear Committee of Catalonia and was part of the [[eco-pacifist]] and [[anti-NATO]] movement. He was also a major influence in the formation of the [[Federación de Enseñanza]], an educational branch of the [[Comisiones Obreras]] [[trade union]].

Until his death, on 27 August 1985, at the age of 59, Manuel Sacristán carried out an intense intellectual and political struggle, becoming one of the most prominent Spanish political philosophers of the twentieth century.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Dooley lives in Co. Dublin with his wife and their three children.

== Works and themes ==
=== Søren Kierkegaard ===
In ''The Politics of Exodus: Kierkegaard's Ethics of Responsibility'' (2001), Dooley offers a new interpretation of Kierkegaard as a precursor of the ethical and political insights of Jacques Derrida. He argues that the connections between the two run much deeper than previously suggested. He shows Kierkegaard as being a proponent not of asocial individualism, but rather of the notion of an open quasi-community which has influenced Derrida's work.

=== Postmodern ethics and Christianity ===
''Questioning Ethics: Contemporary Debates in Philosophy'' (1999), co-edited with [[Richard Kearney]], is a major overview of debates about contemporary European ethical thought bringing together the world's foremost philosophers. Including original essays by [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]], it considers the challenges posed by ethics and the transformation of philosophy by critical thinking. It discusses contemporary ethical issues related to historiography, memory, revisionism, responsibility and justice, democracy, multiculturalism and the future of politics.

''Questioning God'' (2001) comprises fifteen essays based on a conference organised by the editors (Mark Dooley, Michael J. Scanlon and John D. Caputo) at [[Villanova University]] in 1999. It explores contemporary thinking about God with special attention to the phenomenon of forgiveness. Contributors include John Milbank, Richard Kearney, Jean Greisch, Francis Schüssler Fiorenza, Kevin Hart and Jacques Derrida.

''A Passion for the Impossible: John D. Caputo in Focus'' (2002) is the first detailed study of the works of [[John D. Caputo]]. It features contributions from Jacques Derrida, W. Norris Clarke, William J. Richardson, Merold Westphal, Thomas R. Flynn, Richard Kearney &amp; Edith Wyschogrod. In particular, it includes an interview of Derrida by Mark Dooley which contains Derrida's definitive statement on religion: ‘The Becoming Possible of the Impossible.'

=== Jacques Derrida ===
In 2007, Dooley co-authored ''The Philosophy of Derrida'' which presents the core philosophical ideas of Jacques Derrida and an appraisal of their impact. 
In this book, Derrida appears less as an iconoclast for whom deconstruction implies destruction than as a sensitive writer animated by a respect for institutions and a certain form of conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;On the subject, see also Mark Dooley, ''Roger Scruton. The Philosopher on Dover Beach'', 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

His correspondence with Derrida was included in the extensive archive of Derrida papers kept at the [[:fr:Institut mémoires de l'édition contemporaine|Institut mémoires de l'édition contemporaine]] near Caen, Lower Normandy, France.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Roger Scruton ===
''Roger Scruton. The Philosopher of Dover Beach'' (2009) offers the first synoptic analysis of [[Roger Scruton]]’s philosophical thought. In the book, Dooley brings out the core ideas contained in 40 books written by Scruton over four decades, and provides the philosophical background to understand their genesis and their articulation. The composition of the book is pedagogic in that each chapter builds on the concepts laid in the previous one. The different chapters of this book then explore the genealogy of Scruton’s thought and the various themes running through his works: personhood, sex and the sacred; aesthetics; Scruton’s conservatism and its economic, legal and environmental implications; and the defence of the nation state in the face of liberal internationalism.&lt;ref&gt;See also http://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2014/05/seeking-way-back-home-philosophy-roger-scruton/&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Roger Scruton Reader'', its companion volume, is a collection of texts by Scruton which Dooley selected, edited and introduced. They are grouped into the following categories: conservatism, the nation, sex and the sacred, culture, and one Dooley calls 'homecomings' and which contains texts on conserving nature, the philosophy of wine, and hunting. The volume also includes a previously unpublished article by Scruton about architecture entitled "Classicism Now."

In ''Conversations with Roger Scruton'', published by Bloomsbury in 2016, Dooley sheds new light on hitherto overlooked areas of Scruton's life and thought.

=== Crisis in the Irish Catholic Church ===
After exposing - at the request of seminarians and of the ''Irish Daily Mail'' - the sources of the moral crisis in Ireland's national seminary, Dooley received overwhelming support from the public and from the Church,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dooley, ''Why Be A Catholic'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; and was asked by priests from various countries to write a book in which he would articulate the way forward for the Irish Catholic Church : ''Why be a Catholic?'' (2011).

On 22 November 2013, he was invited as guest of honour at the [[University of Caen Lower Normandy]], France, where he was asked to give the keynote lecture about the current situation of the Irish Catholic Church. His lecture was entitled "Reclaiming the Irish Church."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dooley, "Reclaiming the Irish Church", ''Etudes Irlandaises'' 40.1, 'Contemporary Issues in Irish Studies', Spring/Summer 2015, pp. 199-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology, self and the world ===
''Moral Matters. A Philosophy of Homecoming'' (2015) is loosely based on his weekly column in the ''Irish Daily Mail.''&lt;ref name="http://drmarkdooley.com/columns"/&gt; It is a philosophical work about home and rootedness, memory and identity, loss and love. Analyzing the alienation experienced by the self when disengaging from the social sphere surrounding it, Dooley shows how the self can become re-rooted to time and place and restored to full humanity whilst moving in the virtual, hyperconnected world.&lt;ref&gt;For a critical review, see [http://www.crisismagazine.com/2015/catholic-philosopher-challenges-modern-spiritual-wasteland Sean Haylock, "Catholic Philosopher Challenges Modern Spiritual Wasteland", ''Crisis Magazine'', August 14, 2015].

'''Metaphilosophy''' (sometimes called '''philosophy of philosophy''') is "the investigation of the nature of [[philosophy]]".&lt;ref name=Lazerowitz/&gt; Its subject matter includes the aims of philosophy, the boundaries of philosophy, and its methods.&lt;ref name=Joll&gt;{{cite web |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/con-meta/ |title=Contemporary Metaphilosophy |author=Nicholas Joll |date=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marsoobian&gt;
{{cite book |chapter=Metaphilosophy |title=American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KmUTkreTEQsC&amp;pg=PA500  |pages=500–501 |quote=Its primary question is "''What is philosophy?''" |author=Armen T Marsoobian |editor1=John Lachs |editor2=Robert Talisse |isbn=020349279X |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while philosophy characteristically inquires into the nature of being, the reality of objects, the possibility of knowledge, the nature of truth, and so on, metaphilosophy is the self-reflective inquiry into the nature, aims, and methods of the activity that makes these kinds of inquiries, by asking what ''is'' philosophy itself, what sorts of questions it should ask, how it might pose and answer them, and what it can achieve in doing so. It is considered by some to be a subject prior and preparatory to philosophy,&lt;ref name=Griswold&gt;See for example, {{cite book |title=Platonic Writings/Platonic Readings |author= [http://www.bu.edu/philo/people/faculty/full-time/charles-l-griswold/ Charles L. Griswold Jr.] |isbn=0271044810 |publisher=Penn State Press |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCB33OPRE-AC&amp;pg=PA146 |pages=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others see it as inherently a part of philosophy,&lt;ref name=Heidegger&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Martin Heidegger]] |year=1956 |title= Was Ist Das--die Philosophie? |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6wclkEHlZyQC&amp;pg=PA21 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=21 |isbn= 0808403192}}&lt;/ref&gt; or automatically a part of philosophy&lt;ref name=Williamson&gt;{{cite book |author=Timothy Williamson |title= The Philosophy of Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |chapter=Preface |page= ''ix'' |quote=The philosophy of philosophy is automatically part of philosophy, just as the philosophy of anything else is...|isbn=	0470695919 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;pg=PR9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others adopt some combination of these views.&lt;ref name=Joll/&gt; The interest in metaphilosophy led to the establishment of the journal ''[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]]'' in January 1970.&lt;ref name=Scope&gt;
The journal [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291467-9973/homepage/ProductInformation.html describes its scope] as: "Particular areas of interest include: the foundation, scope, function and direction of philosophy; justification of philosophical methods and arguments; the interrelations among schools or fields of philosophy (for example, the relation of logic to problems in ethics or epistemology); aspects of philosophical systems; presuppositions of philosophical schools; the relation of philosophy to other disciplines (for example, artificial intelligence, linguistics or literature); sociology of philosophy; the relevance of philosophy to social and political action; issues in the teaching of philosophy."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''term'' metaphilosophy and explicit attention to metaphilosophy as a specific domain within philosophy arose in the 20th century, the topic is likely as old as philosophy itself, and can be traced back at least as far as the works of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/con-meta/#SH1a IEP]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to philosophy==
Some philosophers consider metaphilosophy to be a subject apart from philosophy, above or beyond it,&lt;ref name=Griswold/&gt; while others object to that idea.&lt;ref name=Heidegger/&gt; [[Timothy Williamson]] argues that the philosophy of philosophy is "automatically part of philosophy", as is the philosophy of anything else.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; Nicholas Bunnin and [[Jiyuan Yu]] write that the separation of first- from second-order study has lost popularity as philosophers find it hard to observe the distinction.&lt;ref name=Bunnin&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nicholas Bunnin  |author2=Jiyuan Yu  |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter= Metaphilosophy  |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 |pages= 426–427 |isbn=1405191120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HyNPwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; As evidenced by these contrasting opinions, debate persists as to whether the evaluation of the nature of philosophy is 'second order philosophy' or simply 'plain philosophy'.

Many philosophers have expressed doubts over the value of metaphilosophy.&lt;ref name=Overgaard&gt;
{{cite book |title=An introduction to metaphilosophy |chapter=Introduction: What good is metaphilosophy? |page=6 |author1=Søren Overgaard |author2=Paul Gilbert |author3=Stephen Burwood |year=2013  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521193419 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr6sOHSa1aoC&amp;pg=PA6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Among them is [[Gilbert Ryle]]: "preoccupation with questions about methods tends to distract us from prosecuting the methods themselves. We run as a rule, worse, not better, if we think a lot about our feet. So let us ... not speak of it all but just do it."&lt;ref name=Ryle&gt;
{{cite book |title=Collected Essays 1929-1968: Collected Papers Volume 2  |author=[[Gilbert Ryle]] |page=331 |chapter=Chapter 23: Ordinary language |isbn=0415485495 |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge  |edition=Reprint of Hutchinson 1971 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Collected_papers_Vol_2_Collected_essays.html?id=k1G1NAAACAAJ }} Quoted by {{cite book |title=An introduction to metaphilosophy |chapter=Introduction: What good is metaphilosophy? |page=6 |author1=Søren Overgaard |author2=Paul Gilbert |author3=Stephen Burwood |year=2013  |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521193419 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr6sOHSa1aoC&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The designations ''metaphilosophy'' and ''philosophy of philosophy'' have a variety of meanings, sometimes taken to be synonyms, and sometimes seen as distinct.

[[Morris Lazerowitz]] claims to have coined the term 'metaphilosophy' around 1940 and used it in print in 1942.&lt;ref name=Lazerowitz&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lazerowitz, M. |year=1970 |title=A note on "metaphilosophy" |journal=Metaphilosophy  |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=91 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9973.1970.tb00792.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.1970.tb00792.x}} see also the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] article by Nicholas Joll: [http://www.iep.utm.edu/con-meta/#SH1b Contemporary Metaphilosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lazerowitz proposed that metaphilosophy is 'the investigation of the nature of philosophy'.&lt;ref name=Lazerowitz/&gt;  Earlier uses have been found in translations from the French.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau G.]], ''In the evening of my thought'' (''Au soir de la pensée'', Paris: Plon, 1927), Houghton Mifflin company, 1929, Vol. 2, p.498: "this teratological product of metaphilosophy"; [[Etienne Gilson|Gilson E.]], ''Christianity and philosophy'', Pub. for the Institute of Mediaeval Studies by Sheed &amp; Ward, 1939, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from [[Greek (language)|Greek]] word ''[[meta]]'' μετά ("after", "beyond", "with") and ''[[philosophy|philosophía]]'' φιλοσοφία ("love of wisdom").

The term 'metaphilosophy' is used by [[Paul Moser]]&lt;ref name=Moser&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul K. Moser |chapter=Metaphilosophy |editor= Robert Audi |title= The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher= Paw Prints 2008-06-26 |year=2008 |edition=Paperback reprint of 2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bVXPwAACAAJ |isbn=1439503508 |pages= 561–562}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of a 'second-order' or more fundamental undertaking than philosophy itself, in the manner suggested by Charles Griswold:&lt;ref name=Griswold/&gt;
{{quote|"The distinction between philosophy and metaphilosophy has an analogue in the familiar distinction between mathematics and metamathematics."&lt;ref name=Moser/&gt;|Paul K. Moser|''Metaphilosophy, ''p. 562}}
This usage was considered nonsense by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who rejected the analogy between [[metalanguage]] and a metaphilosophy.&lt;ref name=Wittgenstein&gt;{{cite book |author=Wittgenstein L. |title=Philosophical Investigations |publisher=Blackwell |year=1963 |url=http://gormendizer.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Ludwig.Wittgenstein.-.Philosophical.Investigations.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120903184826/http://gormendizer.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Ludwig.Wittgenstein.-.Philosophical.Investigations.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-03 |chapter=Paragraph 121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As expressed by Martin Heidegger:&lt;ref name=Heidegger/&gt;
{{quote|"When we ask, "''What is philosophy?''" then we are speaking ''about'' philosophy. By asking in this way we are obviously taking a stand above and, therefore, outside of philosophy. But the aim of our question is to enter into philosophy, to tarry in it, to conduct ourselves in its manner, that is, to "philosophize". The path of our discussion must, therefore, not only have a clear direction, but this direction must at the same time give us the guarantee that we are moving within philosophy and not outside of it and around it."&lt;ref name=Heidegger/&gt;|Martin Heidegger |''Was Ist Das--die Philosophie? ''p. 21}}

Some other philosophers treat the prefix ''[[meta]]'' as simply meaning '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''about...''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', rather than as referring to a [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] 'second-order' form of philosophy, among them [[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher]]&lt;ref name=Rescher&gt;{{cite book |author=Rescher N. |year=2007 |title=Philosophical Dialectics, an Essay on Metaphilosophy |chapter=Chapter 1: Philosophical principles|page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju4rh20YqJIC&amp;pg=PA1 |isbn=0791467465 |publisher= State University of New York Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Double.&lt;ref name=Double&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Double |year=1996 |title=Metaphilosophy and Free Will |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195355415 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dbKQUpUWgmEC&amp;q=metaphilosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Timothy Williamson|Williamson]], prefer the term ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'philosophy of philosophy''' instead of 'metaphilosophy' as it avoids the connotation of a 'second-order' discipline that looks down on philosophy, and instead denotes something that is a part of it.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book |author=Williamson, Timothy |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Philosophy of Philosophy |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Preface |isbn=1405133961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joll suggests that to take metaphilosophy as 'the application of the methods of philosophy to philosophy itself' is too vague, while the view that sees metaphilosophy as a 'second-order' or more abstract discipline, outside philosophy, "is narrow and tendentious".&lt;ref name=Jo11b&gt;

{{cite journal |author=Nicholas Joll |title=Contemporary Metaphysics: Defining metaphilosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/con-meta/#SH1b |journal=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=November 18, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[analytic philosophy|analytical tradition]], the term "metaphilosophy" is mostly used to tag commenting and research on previous works as opposed to original contributions towards solving [[philosophical problems]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g.[[PhilPapers]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] wrote about the nature of philosophical puzzles and philosophical understanding. He suggested philosophical errors arose from confusions about the nature of philosophical inquiry. In the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', Wittgenstein wrote that there is not a metaphilosophy in the sense of a [[metatheory]] of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;One might think: if philosophy speaks of the use of the word "philosophy" there must be a second-order philosophy. But it is not so; it is, rather, like the case of othography, which deals with the word "orthography"  among others without then being second order. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] ''Philosophical Investigations'' Blackwell Oxford 1963 para 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. D. Broad]] distinguished Critical from Speculative philosophy in his "The Subject-matter of Philosophy, and its Relations to the special Sciences," in ''Introduction to Scientific Thought'', 1923. [[Curt Ducasse]], in ''Philosophy as a Science'', examines several views of the nature of philosophy, and concludes that philosophy has a distinct subject matter: [[Appraisal theory|appraisals]]. Ducasse's view has been among the first to be described as 'metaphilosophy'.&lt;ref&gt;Dommeyer F., (1961), A Critical Examination of C. J. Ducasse's Metaphilosophy, ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', Vol. 21, (Jun., 1961), No. 4 pp. 439-455&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Lefebvre]] in ''Métaphilosophie'' (1965)  argued, from a Marxian standpoint, in favor of an "ontological break", as a necessary methodological approach for critical social theory (whilst criticizing [[Louis Althusser]]'s "epistemological break" with subjective Marxism, which represented a fundamental theoretical tool for the school of Marxist structuralism).

[[Paul Moser]] writes that typical metaphilosophical discussion includes determining the conditions under which a claim can be said to be a philosophical one. He regards [[meta-ethics]], the study of [[ethics]], to be a form of metaphilosophy, as well as [[meta-epistemology]], the study of [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name=Moser/&gt;

==Topics==
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
&lt;!--We need a more thorough, less single-author introduction to the kind of things which metaphilosophy studies --&gt;
Many sub-disciplines of philosophy have their own branch of 'metaphilosophy', examples being [[meta-aesthetics]], [[meta-epistemology]], [[meta-ethics]], [[meta-ontology]], and so forth.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;
{{cite book |title=Formal Axiology and Its Critics |editor=Rem B. Edwards |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4WoQhVQSNlwC&amp;pg=PA21 |page=21 |author=Robert S Hartman |chapter=Axiology as a science |isbn=	9051839103 |publisher=Rodopi |year=1995 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, some topics within 'metaphilosophy' cut across the various subdivisions of philosophy to consider fundamentals important to all its sub-disciplines. Some of these are mentioned below.
* Cognitivity
* Systematicity
* Methodology
* Historicity
* Self-reference and Self-application
* Immanence and non-immanence
* Disagreement and diversity
* Primacy of the practical
* Philosophy good and bad
* Philosophy and expertise
* Ends of philosophy
* Death of philosophy
* Anti-philosophies
* Philosophy and assertion
* Philosophy and exposition
* Philosophy and style
* Philosophy as literature
* Literature as philosophy
* Philosophical beauty
* Philosophy as science
* Philosophy and related fields and activities
* Philosophy and argument
* Philosophy and wisdom
* Philosophy and metaphilosophy
* Philosophy and the folk
* Philosophy and 'primitive' life
* Philosophy and philosophers
* Philosophy and pedagogy&lt;ref&gt;[https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/meta/topics.htm legacy.earlham.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aims===
Some philosophers (e.g. [[existentialism|existentialists]], [[pragmatism|pragmatists]]) think philosophy is ultimately a practical discipline that should help us lead meaningful lives by showing us who we are, how we relate to the world around us and what we should do. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Others (e.g. [[analytical philosophy|analytic philosophers]]) see philosophy as a technical, formal, and entirely theoretical discipline, with goals such as "the disinterested pursuit of knowledge for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed goals of philosophy include "discover[ing] the absolutely fundamental reason of everything it investigates",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Modern Thomistic Philosophy'' by R Phillips&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2013}} "making explicit the nature and significance of ordinary and scientific beliefs",&lt;ref&gt;Collins English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and unifying and transcending the insights given by science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Mastering Philosophy by Anthony Harrison-Barbet&lt;/ref&gt; Others proposed that philosophy is a complex discipline because it has 4 or 6 different dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer (1993) The Four Dimensions of Philosophy: Metaphysical-Moral-Objective-Categorical&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vidal, Clément|title=Metaphilosophical Criteria for Worldview Comparison|journal=Metaphilosophy|year=2012|volume=43|issue=3|pages=306–347|url=http://homepages.vub.ac.be/%7Eclvidal/writings/Vidal-Metaphilosophical-Criteria.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2012.01749.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boundaries===
Defining philosophy and its boundaries is itself problematic; [[Nigel Warburton]] has called it "notoriously difficult".&lt;ref name="ptb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophy: The Basics |author=[[Nigel Warburton]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNotC2OQocIC&amp;printsec=frontcover |page=1 |isbn=0203202023 |year=2003 |publisher=CRC Press |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no straightforward definition,&lt;ref name="mp"&gt;''Mastering Philosophy'', by Anthony Harrison-Barbet&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2013}} and most interesting definitions are controversial.&lt;ref name="ocp"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] |chapter= Philosophy |page=702 |author= The Rt. Hon. Lord Quinton |isbn= 0199264791 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher= Oxford University Press |editor =Ted Honderich }}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote:

{{quote|"We may note one peculiar feature of philosophy. If someone asks the question what is mathematics, we can give him a dictionary definition, let us say the science of number, for the sake of argument. As far as it goes this is an uncontroversial statement... Definitions may be given in this way of any field where a body of definite knowledge exists. But philosophy cannot be so defined. Any definition is controversial and already embodies a philosophic attitude. The only way to find out what philosophy is, is to do philosophy."&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;
{{cite book |title= The Wisdom of the West:  A Historical Survey of Western Philosophy in Its Social and Political Setting |page=7 |year=1959 |publisher=Doubleday |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Z2lEUY-DDOSNygHj3oHIBw&amp;id=5SWzAAAAMAAJ |author=Bertrand Russell}}
&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Bertrand Russell]]|''The Wisdom of the West'', p.7}}

While there is some agreement that philosophy involves general or fundamental topics,&lt;ref name="pdp"&gt;''Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'': "the most fundamental and general concepts and principles involved in thought, action and reality"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mtp"&gt;''Modern Thomistic Philosophy'', by R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no clear agreement about a series of demarcation issues, including:

*that between first-order and second-order investigations. Some authors say that philosophical inquiry is second-order, having concepts, theories and presupposition as its subject matter; that it is "thinking about thinking", of a "generally second-order character";&lt;ref name=OxfordCNE&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Companion to Philosophy New Edition |chapter=Conceptual analysis |isbn=0199264791 |editor= Ted Honderich |year=2005 |edition =2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press USA |quote="Insofar as conceptual analysis is the method of philosophy (as it was widely held to be for much of the twentieth century), philosophy is a second-order subject because it is about language not the world or what language is about. |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9oAomj2IIwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; that philosophers study, rather than use, the concepts that structure our thinking. However, the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' warns that "the borderline between such 'second-order' reflection, and ways of practicing the first-order discipline itself, is not always clear: philosophical problems may be tamed by the advance of a discipline, and the conduct of a discipline may be swayed by philosophical reflection".&lt;ref name=OxfordDOP&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy |page=277 |chapter=Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5wTQtwB1NdgC&amp;pg=PA277 |author=Simon Blackburn |isbn=0198610130 |year=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*that between philosophy and [[Empiricism|empirical science]]. Some argue that philosophy is distinct from science in that its questions cannot be answered empirically, that is, by observation or experiment.&lt;ref name=Simons&gt;

===Methods===
{{main article|Philosophical method}}

Philosophical method (or philosophical methodology) is the study of how to do philosophy. A common view among philosophers is that philosophy is distinguished by the ways that philosophers follow in addressing philosophical questions. There is not just one method that philosophers use to answer philosophical questions.

Recently, some philosophers have cast doubt about intuition as a basic tool in philosophical inquiry, from Socrates up to contemporary philosophy of language. In ''Rethinking Intuition''&lt;ref&gt;''Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and its Role in Philosophical Inquiry '',(Studies in Epistemology and Cognitive Theory)
Michael DePaul, William Ramsey (Editors), Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. (1998) {{ISBN|0-8476-8796-1}}; {{ISBN|978-0-8476-8796-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; various thinkers discard intuition as a valid source of knowledge and thereby call into question 'a priori' philosophy. [[Experimental philosophy]] is a form of philosophical inquiry that makes at least partial use of [[empirical|empirical research]]—especially ''[[opinion polling]]''—in order to address persistent [[list of philosophical questions|philosophical questions]]. This is in contrast with the methods found in [[analytic philosophy]], whereby some say a philosopher will sometimes begin by appealing to his or her [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] on an issue and then form an [[argument]] with those intuitions as [[premise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Knobe (forthcoming).&lt;/ref&gt; However, disagreement about what experimental philosophy can accomplish is widespread and several philosophers have offered [[Experimental philosophy#Criticisms|criticisms]]. One claim is that the empirical data gathered by experimental philosophers can have an indirect effect on philosophical questions by allowing for a better understanding of the underlying psychological processes which lead to philosophical intuitions.&lt;ref&gt;Knobe, J. and Nichols, S. (eds.) (2008) ''Experimental Philosophy''] §2.1, {{OCLC|233792562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progress===
A prominent question in metaphilosophy is that of whether or not philosophical progress occurs and more so, whether such progress in philosophy is even possible.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Eric (2011). [http://commons.pacificu.edu/eip/vol12/iss2/9/ There Is No Progress in Philosophy]. Essays in Philosophy 12 (2):9.&lt;/ref&gt; It has even been disputed, most notably by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], whether genuine philosophical problems actually exist. The opposite has also been claimed, for example  by [[Karl Popper]], who held that such problems do exist, that they are solvable, and that he had actually found definite solutions to some of them.

[[David Chalmers]] divides inquiry into philosophical progress in metaphilosophy into three questions.
#The Existence Question: is there progress in philosophy?
#The Comparison Question: is there as much progress in philosophy as in science?
#The Explanation Question: why isn’t there more progress in philosophy?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chalmers|first1=David|title=Why Isn't There More Progress in Philosophy?|journal=Philosophy|date=2015|volume=90|issue=1|pages=3-31|doi=10.1017/S0031819114000436|url=http://consc.net/papers/progress.pdf|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ninth Bridgewater Treatise''' was published by [[Charles Babbage]] in 1837 as a response to the eight [[Natural theology#The Bridgewater Treatises|Bridgewater Treatises]] that the [[Earl of Bridgewater]], [[Francis Henry Egerton]], 8th Earl, had funded and in particular with reference to a comment in one of them by [[William Whewell]]

The book is a work of [[natural theology]], and incorporates extracts from related correspondence of Herschel with [[Charles Lyell]].&lt;ref&gt;Note I, in [http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/Ancillary/1838_Bridgewater_A25/1838_Bridgewater_A25.html darwin-online.org.uk, ''Babbage, Charles. 1838. The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. 2d edn. London: John Murray.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage put forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator.  In this book, Babbage dealt with relating interpretations between science and religion; on the one hand, he insisted that ''"there exists no fatal collision between the words of [[The Bible|Scripture]] and the facts of nature;"'' on the one hand, he wrote the [[Book of Genesis]] was not meant to be read literally in relation to geological terms. Against those who said these were in conflict, he wrote ''"that the contradiction they have imagined can have no real existence, and that whilst the testimony of [[Moses]] remains unimpeached, we may also can be permitted to confide in the testimony of our senses."''&lt;ref&gt;Babbage, [http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/bridgewater/b4.htm Ninth Bridgewater Treatise]. Chapter V. Further View of the same Subject. The Victorian Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage also defends the belief in miracles, in his Chapter VIII, where he states:
{{Quote|It is more consistent with the attributes of the Deity to look upon miracles not as deviations from the laws assigned by the Almighty for the government of matter and of mind; but as the exact fulfilment of much more extensive laws than those we suppose to exist.|&lt;ref&gt;http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/bridgewater/b8.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{Western Buddhism}}

{{nihongo|'''Oshō'''|和尚|oshō}} is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] priest (in charge of a temple);&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', Tokyo 1991, {{ISBN|4-7674-2015-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; honorific title of preceptor or high priest (especially in [[Zen]] or Pure Land Buddhism). The same [[kanji]] are also pronounced '''kashō''' as an honorific title of preceptor or high priest in [[Tendai]] or [[Kegon]] Buddhism and '''wajō''' as an honorific title of preceptor or high priest in [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]], [[East Asian Yogācāra|Hossō]], [[Risshū (Buddhism)|Ritsu]] or [[Jōdo Shinshū|Shin Buddhism]].

==Etymology==
'''Oshō''' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] reading of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''hé shang'' (和尚), meaning a high-ranking [[Buddhist]] monk or highly virtuous [[Buddhist monk]]. It is also a respectful designation for Buddhist monks in general and may be used with the suffix ''-san''.

According to the Kōjien Japanese dictionary and the Kanjigen dictionary of Chinese character source meanings, it is originally derived from the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[upajjhaya|upadhyaya]]'', meaning "master" in the sense of "teacher".{{sfn|Tōdō|2007}}{{sfn|Shinmura|1998}}

The literal meaning is "self-taught Buddhist monk/teacher"&lt;ref group=web name=WhatOsho&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100813215756/http://www.livingworkshop.net/osho.html Oshobob, ''What is an Osho?]&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese term "he-shang" is derived from the Sanskrit word upadhyaya or acharya:
{{quote|As the new Buddhist students and scholars, who eventually became teachers and practitioners, had to give a name to themselves, they came up with a name in Khotanese dialect that supposedly translated the Sanskrit word upadhyaya which
meant 'teacher". It is also possible that it is a translation (or transliteration) of the Sanskrit word acharya, an Indian word that has a higher connotation--a teacher of religion, or the truth itself.&lt;ref group=web name=WhatOsho /&gt;}}

The standard English translation of ''oshō'' has become ''priest'', it has a somewhat different connotation in Zen:
{{quote|While priest may be associated with ceremonial functions – which cause many Western Zen practitioners to balk – there is another way to read the term, simply as a "technologist of the spirit." Within the Zen tradition, this would suggest a certain mastery of one or more of the Zen arts of contemplation. If we consider the word priest literally means “elder,” from the Latin presbyter, a Zen priest would be both a trained technologist of the spirit and an elder with the community.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2009/03/monks-nuns-priests-in-western-zen.html James Ishmael Ford: ''Bodhisattva Ordination, Leadership Reform, and the Role of Zen Clerics in Japan'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the Kōjien, the two characters making up the word are actually pronounced ''oshō'' only in the [[Zen]] and [[Pure Land]] sects. For example, they are read ''kashō'' in the [[Tendai]] sect and ''wajō'' in the [[Shingon]] sect.{{sfn|Shinmura|1998}}

==History==
Oshō became an honorific title for Zen-masters", meaning "harmonious respect":
{{quote|When the Zen masters referred to themselves, or their disciples addressed them, they would often use this word, heshang. As it originally meant simply a "self-taught Buddhist monk/teacher" Zen masters would often speak of themselves in this vein - "this old heshang is going to sleep now."--indicating a kind of self-deprication in front of their students - as if "I am just like you, not more advanced or better, just a student really." But as it is with disciples, this is hard for them to accept, the master is of course much more evolved, much higher.  When a Zen disciple used this word heshang to address his master, it took on a much more reverential connotation, as if combining high respect and love simultaneously.&lt;ref group=web name=WhatOsho /&gt;}}

An example of its use is in Rinzai's teachings:
{{quote|29.a. Followers of the Way, I hold the transmission of the generations from Mayoku Osho, Tanka Osho, Doitsu Osho, Rozan Osho, Sekikyo Osho. All have gone the same way. Nobody could believe in them, all were reviled.&lt;br&gt;
Doitsu Osho's actualization was pure, it was not coarse. None of his three hundred or five hundred students could make out his
meaning.&lt;br&gt;
Rozan Osho was free and true, master of his actualization, whether adapting it or going contrary. But none of his students
could fathom his vast horizon and were startled.&lt;br&gt;
Tanka Osho played with the pearl (of wisdom, hidden in the sea), sometimes hiding it and sometimes revealing it. He was slandered by all students who came to him.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Translations/Teachings_of_Rinzai.pdf Irmgard Schloegel, ''The Zen Teaching of Rinzai''. Page 45]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sōtō Zen==
In [[Sōtō]] Zen, to become an ''oshō'', teacher, two more steps are to be taken after [[dharma transmission]], namely ''ten-e'' and ''zuise''.&lt;ref name=Antaiji3 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201007.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Ten-e and some words about Zui-se'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ten-e'' means "to turn the robe":&lt;ref name=Antaiji3 group=web /&gt;
{{quote|Unsui (training monks) are allowed to wear only black robes and black o-kesa [...] [T]en-e is the point in the career of a Soto monk when you are finally allowed to wear a yellow-brown robe.&lt;ref name=Antaiji3 group=web /&gt;}}

After ''zuise'' one becomes an ''oshō'', whereafter one may become the resident priest in one's own temple.&lt;ref name=Antaiji3 group=web /&gt; Hereby one can gain the highest rank:
{{quote|After you become the head priest at your own temple and hold a practice period there for the first time (with one student acting as the shuso), you will finally reach the highest rank of dai-osho.&lt;ref name=Antaiji3 group=web /&gt;}}

To supervise the training of monks, further qualifications are necessary:
{{quote|The relatively low status of dharma transmission means that in and of itself it does not qualify one to accept students or to train disciples. According to the regulations, Zen students should be supervised only by a teacher who has attained supervisory certification (i.e. ''sanzen dōjō shike'' status), that is, someone who in the popular literature might be called a [[Zen master]]. To attain supervisory certification requires not just high ecclesiastical grades and dharma seniority but also at least three years' experience as an assistant supervisor at a specially designated training hall (''tokubetsu sōdō''), during which time one undergoes an apprenticeship.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|276}}}}

==Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh==
The term became well known in the west when [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] started to call himself ''Osho''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5685">In [[epistemology]], '''phenomenal conservatism''' ('''PC''') holds that it is reasonable to assume that things are as they appear, except when there are positive grounds for doubting this. (The term derives from the Greek word "phainomenon", meaning "appearance".)

The principle was initially defended by [[Michael Huemer]] in Huemer 2001, where it was formulated as follows:

*If it seems to ''S'' as if ''p'', then ''S'' thereby has at least ''prima facie'' justification for believing that ''p''.

A later formulation (Huemer 2007), designed to allow the principle to encompass inferential as well as foundational justification, reads as follows:

*If it seems to ''S'' that ''p'', then, in the absence of defeaters, ''S'' thereby has at least some degree of justification for believing that ''p''.

== Arguments for PC ==
Phenomenal conservatism has been defended on three grounds.

#First, the principle enables one to account for the justification of most, perhaps all, of the beliefs that we commonly take as justified, including sensory observations, memory beliefs, and beliefs based on reasoning.
#Second, it is argued that alternative epistemological positions are self-defeating in the sense that, unless PC is true, few or no beliefs would be justified, including beliefs in any alternative epistemological theories. This is supported by the claims
#*that all or nearly all beliefs are causally explained by appearances, that is, one believes a proposition because it seems true to one; and
#*that a belief is justified only if it is causally explained by a factor that constitutes justification for the proposition believed.
#Third, it is argued that PC is most faithful to the motivations underlying epistemological [[internalism]].

== Criticisms of PC ==
Critics of phenomenal conservatism have argued:
*That the principle is overly liberal, making far too many beliefs count as justified. In particular, PC implies that one is justified in believing a proposition that appears true to one, even in the absence of any reason for thinking that the faculty generating the appearance is reliable.
*That the self-defeat argument unfairly begs the question against skepticism.
*That the self-defeat argument cannot establish that externalist alternatives to PC are self-defeating without appeal to internalist assumptions.
*That the intuitions that seem to favor PC over rival internalist views support views on which fallacious reasoning can count as justified.
*That (in its original formulation) the principle makes inferential beliefs count as foundational.
*That PC enables a belief to be justified even when the relevant appearance (and so the belief) was ultimately caused by epistemically irresponsible behavior, such as wishful thinking.
*That seeming-based justification is elusive, in the sense that it can be destroyed by one's mere reflecting on one's seemings and speculating about their possible causes.

In addition, as a form of [[foundationalism]], PC is open to some of the common objections to that doctrine.

'''Pragmatic validity''' in research looks to a different [[paradigm]]s from more traditional, (post)[[positivistic]] research approaches. It tries to ameliorate problems associated with the rigour-relevance debate, and is applicable in all kinds of research streams. Simply put, pragmatic validity looks at research from a [[prescriptive]]-driven perspective. Solutions to problems that actually occur in the complex and highly [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] field of practice are developed in a way that, while valid for a specific situation, need to be adjusted according to the context in which they are to be applied.

The term "validity" is often seen as a sort catch-all for the question whether the knowledge claims resulting from research are warranted. The confusion might arise from the mingling of the terms ‘internal validity’ and ‘external validity’, where the former refers to proof of a causal link between a treatment and effect, and the latter is concerned with generalizability. (In this discussion I maintain the term ‘generalizability’ rather than external validity mainly to avoid any possible confusion between the two terms.) During this discussion  I consider that validity is reflected in the question, “did we measure the right thing?”, or, in other words, can the researcher prove that the effect he observed was actually a result of the cause? [[Positivistic]] research approaches this question in a different way than pragmatic research, which is based in a different paradigm. [[Design Science Research]] is one example of research firmly situated in a pragmatic perspective.

==Validity in (post)positivist research==

[[Postpositivist]] research typically strives to numerically report upon empirical observations made within a controlled environment in order to arrive at a universal truth about a causal effect between a limited number of variables. This statement relates what much of the [[epistemology]] of [[Positivistic]] science is based on: isolating singular variables in order to come to a conclusion that is free of context. Laboratory experiments and quantitative models are the preferred methods for observing and reporting. These are considered to rule out any rival plausible explanations and thus help to guarantee validity.

==Validity in pragmatic research==

Validity in prescription-driven research is approached in different ways than descriptive research. The first difference deals with what some researchers call ‘messy situations’ (Brown 1992; Collins, Joseph, and Bielaczuc 2004). A messy situation is a real-life, a highly multivariate one is where independent variables cannot be minimized nor completely accounted for. In explanatory science, experiments are in controlled laboratories, where variables can be minimalized. The complex nature of a real-life intervention means that the success or failure (effect) of the intervention may be difficult to conclusively link to the intervention itself (cause). This aspect of knowledge claims from  science is seen as extremely problematic for positivist scientists looking for explanations. However, scientists using a pragmatic paradigm respond to this concept in two ways; first by questioning the value of research carried out in a controlled situation (Brown 1992; Hodkinson 2004; Kelly and Lesh 2000; Perrin 2000; Susman and Evered 1978; Walker and Evers 1999; Zaritsky et al. 2003) and secondly, by looking at causal effects through a different perspective.

The use of the phrase of Pragmatic Validity was first discussed in Worren, Moore &amp; Elliott (2002), who contrasted it with Scientific Validity.  This ideas has been taken up in the management literature to a considerable degree.

Many [[social science]] researchers assert that testing interventions in controlled laboratory settings is hardly feasible and not a reflection of the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1992; Cook 1983; Husen 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For them, real-life settings are needed in order to produce worthwhile research artifacts. These artifacts are validated by the adoption rate of the practitioners within the community of practice associated with the field.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1992; Hodkinson 2004; Zaritsky et al. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Nowotny (2000) calls knowledge that has been validated by the multidisciplinary community of practice ‘socially robust’, meaning that it has been developed in (and for) contexts outside the laboratory and can be used by practitioners.

In the following statement, Cook (1983) refers to the well-known educational researcher Cronbach about multivariate causal interdependency and validity, and the need for understanding the complexity of the situation being researched.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lawful statements of causation require full knowledge of this system of variables so that total prediction of the outcome can be achieved. From his belief in the systemic organization of causal connections and the utility of causal explanations of this type, Cronbach questions whether the experimentalists’ isolation and manipulation of a small set of specific causal agents is sensitive to the real nature of causal agency, which depends on complex patterns of influence between multiple events and also involves characteristics of respondents, settings and times (p.78). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, Cook (1983) actually questions the validity of causal explanations  generated in a context-free setting (the goal of positivistic, explanatory research). Causal relationships in pragmatic research are looked at somewhat differently, which is apparent in the wording alone.

A statement about a causal relationship in positivistic research is something like the following; if you perform action x to subject y, then z happens. This assumes that the confounding variables have been ruled out, and the statement is always true, regardless of the situation (internally and externally valid). What I want to do now is use the concept of ‘technological rules’ in order to illustrate how causality is shown in prescriptive.

In pragmatic science, the goal is to develop knowledge that can be used to improve a situation. This we can call prescriptive knowledge. Prescriptive knowledge, according to van Aken (2004, 2004b, 2005) can take the form of a technological rule. A technological rule is “...a chunk of general knowledge linking an intervention or artifact with an expected outcome or performance in a certain field of application” (van Aken, 2005: p23). This rule can be formulated much the same way as my earlier example of a causal statement; ‘if you perform action X to subject Y, then Z happens’ (Note the cause and effect formulation). This type of algorithmic formulation is called a design solution (vanAken and Romme 2005). A design solution is usually a statistically proven quantitative model that can be taken as specific instruction (van Aken &amp; Romme, 2005). On the other hand, there are more abstract technological rules that are used for designing solutions. These are heuristics that guide, but do not determine, the design process  and are called design solutions (van Aken 2005; van Aken and Romme 2005). Design solutions are formulated in the following way; “ If you want to achieve Y in situation Z, then you perform something like X” (van Aken &amp; Romme, 2005; p.&amp;nbsp;6). In short, the resulting artifacts of pragmatic research can also be causal relationships, just typically not as specific or reductionist as those resulting from positivist research. The words ‘something like’ in the statement implicitly refer to the complexity in which the causal relationship is enacted. The causal agent (X, in the statement above) can also be seen as complex and multivariate (Cook, 1983). Testing these causal agents is done in context, much the same way as evaluation research tests social or economic programs (van Aken 2003) .

'''Qin Shi Huang''' ({{zh|c=秦始皇|l=First Emperor of Qin}}, {{pronunciation|Qin shi huang pronunciation 2.ogg}}; 18 February 259{{sbc}}{{snd}}10 September 210{{sbc}}) was the founder of the [[Qin dynasty]] and was the first [[Emperor of China|emperor of a unified China]]. He was born '''Ying Zheng''' ({{lang|zh|嬴政}}) or '''Zhao Zheng''' ({{lang|zh|趙政}}), a prince of the [[Qin (state)|state of Qin]]. He became '''Zheng, the King of Qin''' ({{lang|zh|秦王政}}) when he was thirteen, then China's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had conquered all of the other [[Warring States period|Warring States]] and [[Qin's wars of unification|unified all of China]] in 221 BC.&lt;ref name="duik"&gt;Duiker, William J. &amp; al.

His self-invented title "emperor" ({{lang|zh|皇帝}} ''{{audio|Zh-huángdì.ogg|huángdì|help=no}}''), as indicated by his use of the word "First", would continue to be borne by [[List of rulers of China|Chinese rulers]] for the next two millennia.

During his reign, his generals greatly expanded the size of the Chinese state: [[Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes|campaigns]] south of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] permanently added the [[Baiyue|Yue]] lands of [[Hunan]] and [[Guangdong]] to the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese cultural orbit]]; [[Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu|campaigns]] in Central Asia conquered the [[Ordos Loop]] from the nomad [[Xiongnu]], although eventually it would also lead to their confederation under [[Modu Chanyu]].

==Origin of name==
Modern Chinese sources often give the personal name of Qin Shi Huang as Ying Zheng, with Ying ({{lang|zh|嬴}}) taken as the surname and Zheng ({{lang|zh|政}}) the given name. In ancient China however the naming convention differed, and Zhao ({{lang|zh|趙}}) may be used as the surname. Unlike modern [[Chinese name]]s, the [[Chinese nobility|nobles]] of [[ancient China]] had two distinct surnames: the [[ancestral name]] ({{lang|zh|姓}}) comprised a larger group descended from a [[ancestral veneration in China|prominent ancestor]], usually said to have lived during the time of the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] of [[Chinese legend]], and the [[Chinese clan name|clan name]] ({{lang|zh|氏}}) comprised a smaller group that showed a branch's current [[fengjian|fief]] or recent title. (This is remarkably similar to the practice of contemporary Romans for naming men, such as M. Tullius Cicero and C. Julius Caesar.) The ancient practice was to list men's names separately{{mdash}}[[Sima Qian]]'s "Basic Annals of the First Emperor of Qin" introduces him as "given the name Zheng and the surname [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]]"&lt;ref name="nianfang"&gt;[[Sima Qian]], translated by William Nienhauser&amp;nbsp;Jr. &amp; al. as ''[[The Grand Scribe's Records]]'', Vol. 1 ''The Basic Annals of Pre-Han China'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qDo3xBcsX-UC&amp;pg=PA127 p.&amp;thinsp;127].

Indiana Univ. Press ([[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]), 1994. {{ISBN|025334025X}}. Accessed 25 Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since modern Chinese surnames (despite usually descending from clan names) use the same character as the old ''ancestral'' names, it is much more common in modern Chinese sources to see the emperor's personal name written as Ying&amp;nbsp;Zheng,{{refn|See, e.g., Nienhauser's gloss of the name Zhao Zheng (n.&amp;thinsp;579).&lt;ref name=choo/&gt;}} using the ancestral name of [[House of Ying|the Ying family]].

The First Emperor intended that his realm would remain intact through the ages but, following its overthrow and replacement by [[Han Dynasty|Han]] after his death, it became customary to prefix his title with Qin. Thus:

==Birth and parentage ==

According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', written by [[Sima Qian]] during the Han dynasty, the first emperor was the eldest son of the Qin prince Yiren, who later became [[King Zhuangxiang of Qin]]. Prince Yiren at that time was residing at the court of [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], serving as a hostage to guarantee the [[armistice]] between the Qin and Zhao states.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;&lt;ref name="RGH"&gt;Ssu-Ma Ch'ien. Burton Watson (trans.) ''Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty'' 3rd ed, pp. 35 &amp; 59. Columbia University Press (New York), 1996. {{ISBN|0-231-08169-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Yiren had fallen in love at first sight with a [[concubine]] of [[Lü Buwei]], a rich merchant from the [[Wey (state)|State of Wey]]. Lü consented for her to be Yiren's wife, who then became known as [[Lady Zhao]] (Zhao Ji) after the state of Zhao. Lady Zhao gave birth to the child on 18 February; and he was given the name Zhao Zheng – the [[Chinese personal name|name]] Zheng ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|正}}}}) came from his month of birth ''Zhengyue'', the first month of the [[Chinese lunar calendar]];&lt;ref name="RGH" /&gt; the [[Chinese surname|clan name]] of [[Zhao (surname)|Zhao]] came from his father's lineage and was unrelated to either his mother's name or the location of his birth.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Lü Buwei's machinations later helped Yiren become [[King Zhuangxiang of Qin]]&lt;ref name="Ren" /&gt; in 250 BC.

However, the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' also claimed that the first emperor was not the actual son of Prince Yiren but that of [[Lü Buwei]].&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;Huang, Ray. ''China: A Macro History'' Edition: 2, revised. (1987). M.E. Sharpe publishing. {{ISBN|1-56324-730-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56324-730-9}}. pg 32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this account, when Lü Buwei introduced the dancing girl to the prince, she was Lü Buwei's [[concubine]] and had already become pregnant by him, and the baby was born after an unusually long period of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Huang" /&gt; According to translations of the [[Lüshi Chunqiu|Annals of Lü Buwei]], Zhao Ji gave birth to the future emperor in the city of [[Handan]] in 259 BC, the first month of the 48th year of [[King Zhaoxiang of Qin]].&lt;ref name="LuAnnal"&gt;Lü, Buwei. Translated by Knoblock, John. Riegel, Jeffrey. ''The Annals of Lü Buwei'': Lü Shi Chun ''Qiu : a Complete Translation and Study''. (2000).

The idea that the emperor was an [[illegitimacy|illegitimate child]], widely believed throughout Chinese history, contributed to the generally negative view of the First Emperor.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; However, a number of modern scholars have doubted this account of his birth. Sinologist [[Derk Bodde]] wrote: "There is good reason for believing that the sentence describing this unusual pregnancy is an interpolation added to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shih-chi]]'' by an unknown person in order to slander the First Emperor and indicate his political as well as natal illegitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bodde|1987|pp= 42–43, 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Knoblock and Jeffrey Riegel, in their translation of Lü Buwei's ''[[Lüshi Chunqiu|Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', call the story "patently false, meant both to libel Lü and to cast aspersions on the First Emperor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Annals of Lü Buwei|others= Knoblock, John and Riegel, Jeffrey Trans.|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2001|isbn= 978-0-8047-3354-0}} p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming Lü Buwei &amp;ndash; a merchant &amp;ndash; as the First Emperor's biological father was meant to be especially disparaging, since later Confucian society regarded merchants as the [[Four occupations|lowest of all social classes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Bodde|1987|p=43}}

After Zhao Zheng inherited the throne, Chengjiao rebelled at [[Tunliu]] and surrendered to the state of Zhao. Chengjiao's remaining retainers and families were executed by Zhao Zheng.&lt;ref&gt;[[Records of the Grand Historian]] Chapter - Qin Shi Huang:八年，王弟长安君成蟜将军击赵，反，死屯留，军吏皆斩死，迁其 民於临洮。将军壁死，卒屯留、蒲鶮反，戮其尸。河鱼大上，轻车重马东就食。 《史记 秦始皇》&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lao Ai's attempted coup===
As King Zheng grew older, [[Lü Buwei]] became fearful that the boy king would discover his liaison with his mother [[Lady Zhao]]. He decided to distance himself and look for a replacement for the queen dowager. He found a man named [[Lao Ai]].&lt;ref name="Mah"&gt;Mah, Adeline Yen. (2003).

Published by HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06-000641-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-06-000641-9}}. p 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Record of Grand Historian'', Lao Ai was disguised as a [[eunuch]] by plucking his beard. Later Lao Ai and queen Zhao Ji got along so well they secretly had two sons together.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt; Lao Ai then became ennobled as [[Marquis]] Lào Ǎi, and was showered with riches. Lao Ai's plot was supposed to replace King Zheng with one of the hidden sons. But during a dinner party drunken Lào Ǎi was heard bragging about being the young king's step father.&lt;ref name="Mah" /&gt; In 238 BC the king was travelling to the ancient capital of [[Fengxiang County|Yōng]] (雍). Lao Ai seized the queen mother's [[Chinese seal|seal]] and mobilized an army in an attempt to start a [[Coup d'état|coup]] and rebel.&lt;ref name="Mah" /&gt; When King Zheng found out this fact, he ordered Lü Buwei to let [[Lord Changping]] and [[Lord Changwen]] attack Lao Ai and their army killed hundreds of the rebels at the capital, although Lao Ai succeeded in fleeing from this battle.&lt;ref&gt;The Records of the Grand Historian, Vol. 6: Annals of Qin Shi Huang.

A price of 1 million [[Cash (Chinese coin)|copper coins]] was placed on Lao Ai's head if he was taken alive or half a million if dead.&lt;ref name="Mah" /&gt; Lao Ai's supporters were captured and [[Decapitation|beheaded]]; then Lao Ai was tied up and torn to five pieces by horse carriages, while his entire family was executed to the third degree.&lt;ref name="Mah" /&gt; The two hidden sons were also killed, while mother Zhao Ji was placed under house arrest until her death many years later. Lü Buwei drank a cup of poison wine and [[committed suicide]] in 235 BC.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mah/&gt; Ying Zheng then assumed full power as the King of the Qin state. Replacing Lü Buwei, [[Li Si]] became the new [[Chancellor of China|chancellor]].

===First attempted assassination===
{{Main|Jing Ke}}

Stone rubbing; 3rd century, [[Eastern Han]]]]
King Zheng and his troops continued to take over different states. The [[Yan (state)|state of Yan]] was small, weak and frequently harassed by soldiers. It was no match for the Qin state.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect"&gt;Sima Qian. Dawson, Raymond Stanley. Brashier, K. E. (2007). ''The First Emperor: Selections from the Historical Records''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-922634-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-922634-4}}. pg 15 - 20, pg 82, pg 99.&lt;/ref&gt; So [[Crown Prince Dan of Yan]] plotted an assassination attempt to get rid of King Zheng, begging [[Jing Ke]] to go on the mission in 227 BC.&lt;ref name="Ren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; [[Jing Ke]] was accompanied by [[Qin Wuyang]] in the plot. Each was supposed to present a gift to King Zheng: a map of Dukang and the severed head of [[Fan Wuji]].&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt;

Qin Wuyang first tried to present the map case gift, but trembled in fear and moved no further towards the king. Jing Ke continued to advance toward the king, while explaining that his partner "has never set eyes on the [[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]]", which is why he is trembling. Jing Ke had to present both gifts by himself.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; While unrolling the map, a [[dagger]] was revealed. The king drew back, stood on his feet, but struggled to draw the sword to defend himself.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; At the time, other palace officials were not allowed to carry weapons. Jing Ke pursued the king, attempting to stab him, but missed. King Zheng drew out his sword and cut Jing Ke's thigh. Jing Ke then threw the dagger, but missed again. Suffering eight wounds from the king's sword, Jing Ke realized his attempt had failed and knew that both of them would be killed afterwards.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; The Yan state was conquered by the Qin state five years later.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt;

As part of the plot, the lute was fastened with a heavy piece of [[lead]]. He raised the lute and struck at the king. He missed, and his assassination attempt failed. Gao Jianli was later executed.&lt;ref name="Wu" /&gt;

===Unification of China===
{{Main|Qin's wars of unification}}
[[File:Qin Unification.png|thumb|450px|Qin's unification of seven warring states]]
In 230 BC, King Zheng unleashed the final campaigns of the [[Warring States period]], setting out to conquer the remaining independent kingdoms, one by one.

The first state to fall was [[Han (state)|Hán]] (韓; sometimes called Hann to distinguish it from the Hàn 漢 of [[Han dynasty]]), in 230 BC. Then Qin took advantage of [[natural disaster]]s in 229 BC to invade and conquer Zhào, where Qin Shi Huang had been born.&lt;ref&gt;Hk.chiculture.net. "[http://hk.chiculture.net/php/sframe.php?url=http://hk.chiculture.net/0105/htmlBackup/0105c12.html HKChinese culture]." ''破趙逼燕.''

Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-39906-7}}. p 22 -23.&lt;/ref&gt; He now avenged his poor treatment as a child hostage there, seeking out and killing his enemies.

Qin armies conquered the state of [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]] in 228 BC, the northern country of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] in 226 BC, the small state of [[Wei (state)|Wei]] in 225 BC, and the largest state and greatest challenge, [[Chu (state)|Chu]], in 223 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Sima Qian: The First Emperor''. Tr. by Raymond Dawson. Oxford University Press. Edition 2007, Chronology, p. xxxix&lt;/ref&gt;

In 222 BC, the last remnants of Yan and the royal family were captured in [[Liaodong]] in the northeast. The only independent country left was now [[Qi (state)|state of Qi]], in the far east, what is now the [[Shandong]] peninsula. Terrified, the young king of Qi sent 200,000 people to defend his western borders. In 221 BC, the Qin armies invaded from the north, captured the king, and annexed Qi. Some of the strategies Qin used to unify China were to standardize the trade and communication, currency and language.

For the first time, all Chinese lands were unified under one powerful ruler. In that same year, King Zheng proclaimed himself the "First Emperor" (始皇帝, ''Shǐ Huángdì''), no longer a king in the old sense and now far surpassing the achievements of the old Zhou Dynasty rulers.&lt;ref name="Clements"&gt;Clements, Jonathan (2006). ''The First Emperor of China''. Sutton Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7509-3959-1}}. pp. 82, 102-103, 131, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor made the [[He Shi Bi]] into the [[Imperial Seal of China|Imperial Seal]], known as the "Heirloom Seal of the Realm". The words, "Having received the Mandate from Heaven, may (the emperor) lead a long and prosperous life." (受命於天，既壽永昌) were written by Prime Minister [[Li Si]], and carved onto the seal by [[Sun Shou]]. The Seal was later passed from emperor to emperor for generations to come.

In the South, military expansion in the form of [[Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes|campaigns against the Yue tribes]] continued during his reign, with various regions being annexed to what is now [[Guangdong]] province and part of today's [[Nanyue|Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Haw" /&gt;

==As the Emperor of Qin==
===Administrative reforms===
{{Further|History of the administrative divisions of China before 1912}}

[[File:Qin Dynasty.png|thumb|Map of Qin Dynasty and its administrative divisions]]

In an attempt to avoid a recurrence of the political chaos of the [[Warring States period]], Qin Shi Huang and his prime minister [[Li Si]] completely abolished [[feudalism]].&lt;ref name="Haw" /&gt; The empire was then divided into 36 [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] (郡, ''Jùn''), later more than 40 commanderies.&lt;ref name="Haw" /&gt; The whole of China was thus divided into administrative units: first commanderies, then [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] (縣, ''Xiàn''), [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|townships]] (鄉, ''Xiāng'') and hundred-family units (里, ''Li'', which roughly corresponds to the modern-day [[Subdistricts of the People's Republic of China|subdistricts]] and [[residential community#China|communities]]).&lt;ref name="Chang"&gt;{{citation

The may be the Wade-Giles romanization of (秦受, ''Qín shòu'') "subjects of the Qin empire".&lt;/ref&gt; Appointments were subsequently based on merit instead of [[hereditary]] rights.&lt;ref name="Chang" /&gt;

===Economic reforms===

Qin Shi Huang and [[Li Si]] unified China economically by standardizing the [[Chinese units of measurement]]s such as weights and [[Units of measurement|measures]], the [[currency]], and the length of the [[axle]]s of [[cart]]s to facilitate transport on the road system.&lt;ref name="Veeck" /&gt; The emperor also developed an extensive network of roads and canals connecting the provinces to improve trade between them.&lt;ref name="Veeck" /&gt; The currencies of the different states were also standardized to the [[Banliang|Ban liang coin]] (半兩, ''Bàn Liǎng'').&lt;ref name="Chang" /&gt; Perhaps most importantly, the [[Chinese character|Chinese script]] was unified. Under Li Si, the [[seal script]] of the state of Qin was standardized through removal of variant forms within the Qin script itself. This newly standardized script was then made official throughout all the conquered regions, thus doing away with all the regional scripts to form one language, one communication system for all of China.&lt;ref name="Chang" /&gt;

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Wu Xing|Burning of books and burying of scholars}}
Qin Shi Huang also followed the school of the [[Wu Xing|five elements]], earth, wood, metal, fire and water. ({{lang|zh-hant|五德終始說}}) Zhao Zheng's birth element is [[Chinese astrology|water]], which is connected with the colour black. It was also believed that the royal house of the previous dynasty [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] had ruled by the power of fire, which was the colour red. The new Qin dynasty must be ruled by the next element on the list, which is water, represented by the colour black. Black became the colour for garments, flags, pennants.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; Other associations include north as the [[cardinal direction]], winter season and the number six.&lt;ref&gt;Murowchick, Robert E. (1994). ''China: Ancient Culture, Modern Land''.

While the previous Warring States era was one of constant warfare, it was also considered the golden age of free thought.&lt;ref name="Goldman"&gt;Goldman, Merle. (1981). ''China's Intellectuals: Advise and Dissent''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-11970-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-674-11970-3}}. pg 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Qin Shi Huang eliminated the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] which incorporated [[Confucianism]] and other philosophies.&lt;ref name="Goldman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaurasia, Radhey Shyam. (2004). ''History of Modern China''. Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors. {{ISBN|81-269-0315-5}}, {{ISBN|978-81-269-0315-3}}. pg 317.&lt;/ref&gt; After the unification of China, with all other schools of thought banned, [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] became the endorsed ideology of the Qin dynasty,&lt;ref name="Chang" /&gt; which was basically a system that required the people to follow the laws or be punished accordingly.

Beginning in 213 BC, at the instigation of Li Si and to avoid scholars' comparisons of his reign with the past, Qin Shi Huang ordered most existing [[To burn the classics and to bury the scholars|books to be burned]] with the exception of those on astrology, agriculture, medicine, divination, and the history of the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]].&lt;ref name="Lih"&gt;Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee.

''The First Emperor of China''. p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Owning the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Songs]]'' or the ''[[Classic of History]]'' was to be punished especially severely. According to the later ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', the following year Qin Shi Huang had some 460 scholars buried alive for owning the forbidden books.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lih" /&gt; The emperor's oldest son [[Fusu]] criticised him for this act.&lt;ref&gt;Twitchett, Denis.

Recent research suggests that the "burying of the Confucian scholars alive" is a Confucian martyrs' legend; rather, the emperor ordered the killing (坑 ''kēng'') of a group of alchemists after having found that they had fooled him. In Han times, the Confucian scholars, who had served the Qin loyally, used that incident to distance themselves from the failed dynasty. [[Kong Anguo]] (孔安國 c. 165 – c. 74 BC), a descendant of Confucius, turned the alchemists (方士 ''fāngshì'') into Confucianists (儒 ''rú'') and entwined the martyrs' legend with the strange story of the rediscovery of the lost Confucian books behind a demolished wall in the house of his ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Neininger, Ulrich, ''Burying the Scholars Alive: On the Origin of a Confucian Martyrs’ Legend,'' ''Nation and Mythology'' (in ''East Asian Civilizations.

===Third attempted assassination===
{{Main|Zhang Liang (Western Han)}}
In 230 BC, the state of Qin had defeated the state of [[Han (state)|Han]]. A Han aristocrat named [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] swore revenge on the Qin emperor. He sold all his valuables and in 218 BC, he [[hitman|hired]] a [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] assassin and built him a heavy metal cone weighing 120 [[Catty|jin]] (roughly 160&amp;nbsp;lb or 97&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="Mah" /&gt; The two men hid among the bushes along the emperor's route over a mountain. At a signal, the muscular assassin hurled the cone at the first carriage and shattered it. However, the emperor was actually in the second carriage, as he was travelling with two identical carriages for this very reason. Thus the attempt failed.&lt;ref name="Wintle"&gt;Wintle, Justin Wintle. (2002). ''China''.

The Qin fought [[nomad]]ic tribes to the north and north-west. The [[Xiongnu]] tribes were not defeated and subdued, thus the campaign was tiring and unsuccessful, and to prevent the Xiongnu from encroaching on the northern frontier any longer, the emperor ordered the construction of an immense defensive wall.&lt;ref name="Haw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, Xiaobing.

===Elixir of life===

Later in his life, Qin Shi Huang feared death and desperately sought the fabled [[elixir of life]], which would supposedly allow him to live forever. He was obsessed with acquiring immortality and fell prey to many who offered him supposed elixirs.&lt;ref name="Ong"&gt;Ong, Siew Chey. Marshall Cavendish. (2006).

Legends claim that they reached [[Japan]] and colonized it.&lt;ref name="Ong" /&gt; It is also possible that the book burning, a purge on what could be seen as wasteful and useless literature, was, in part, an attempt to focus the minds of the Emperor's best scholars on the [[alchemical]] quest. Some of the executed scholars were those who had been unable to offer any evidence of their supernatural schemes. This may have been the ultimate means of testing their abilities: if any of them had magic powers, then they would surely come back to life when they were let out again.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Clements, Jonathan (2006). ''The First Emperor of China''. pp. 131, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the great emperor was afraid of death and "evil spirits", he had workers build a series of tunnels and passageways to each of his palaces (he owned over 200), because traveling unseen would supposedly keep him safe from the evil spirits.

In 211 BC a large [[meteor]] is said to have fallen in Dōngjùn (東郡) in the lower reaches of the [[Yellow River]]. On it, an unknown person inscribed the words "The First Emperor will die and his land will be divided" (始皇死而地分).&lt;ref name="LiangY"&gt;Liang, Yuansheng. (2007). ''The Legitimation of New Orders: Case Studies in World History''. Chinese University Press. {{ISBN|962-996-239-X}}, 9789629962395. pg 5.&lt;/ref&gt; When the emperor heard of this, he sent an imperial secretary to investigate this [[prophecy]]. No one would confess to the deed, so all the people living nearby were put to death. The stone was then burned and pulverized.&lt;ref name="RGH" /&gt;

During his fourth tour of Eastern China, the Emperor became seriously ill after he arrived in Pingyuanjin ([[Pingyuan County, Shandong]]), and died on 10 September 210 BC ([[Julian Calendar]]&lt;!--please leave the date in the Julian calendar, as this is what's used by history books--&gt;) at the palace in Shaqiu [[prefecture]] (沙丘平台, ''Shāqiū Píngtái''), about two months away by road from the capital [[Xianyang]].&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan Muqian Luo, Paul.

The cause of Qin Shi Huang's death is still largely unknown, reportedly, he died from [[Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning]] due to ingesting [[mercury (element)|mercury]] pills, made by his alchemists and court physicians, believing it to be an elixir of immortality.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of China|year=2001|author=Wright, David Curtis|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-30940-X|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Emperor conspiracy===
After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister [[Li Si]], who accompanied him, became extremely worried that the news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, and it would not be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, [[Ying Huhai]], who was travelling with his father, the eunuch [[Zhao Gao]], Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; They also pulled down the shade so no one could see his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act as if he wanted to send them a message.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt;

Eventually, after about two months, Li Si and the imperial court reached Xianyang, where the news of the death of the emperor was announced.&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt; Qin Shi Huang did not like to talk about his own death and he had never written a [[will (law)|will]]. After his death, the eldest son [[Fusu]] would normally become the next emperor.&lt;ref name="Tung"&gt;Tung, Douglas S. Tung, Kenneth. (2003). ''More Than 36 Stratagems: A Systematic Classification Based On Basic Behaviours''. Trafford Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4120-0674-0}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4120-0674-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Li Si and the chief [[eunuch]] [[Zhao Gao]] conspired to kill Fusu because Fusu's favorite general was [[Meng Tian]], whom they disliked&lt;ref name="Tung" /&gt; and feared; Meng Tian's brother, a senior minister, had once punished Zhao Gao.&lt;ref&gt;''Sima Qian: The First Emperor''. Tr. Raymond Dawson. Oxford University Press. Edition 2007. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that if Fusu was enthroned, they would lose their power.&lt;ref name="Tung" /&gt; Li Si and Zhao Gao forged a letter from Qin Shi Huang saying that both Fusu and General Meng must commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Tung" /&gt; The plan worked, and the younger son Hu Hai became the Second Emperor, later known as [[Qin Er Shi]] or "Second Generation Qin".&lt;ref name="Firsteselect" /&gt;

Qin Er Shi, however, was not as capable as his father. Revolts quickly erupted. His reign was a time of extreme civil unrest, and everything built by the First Emperor crumbled away within a short period.&lt;ref name="Haw" /&gt; One of the immediate revolt attempts was the 209 BC [[Daze Village Uprising]] led by [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]].&lt;ref name="LiangY" /&gt;

The Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]], writing a century after the First Emperor's death, wrote that it took 700,000 men to construct the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|emperor's mausoleum]]. British historian [[John Man (author)|John Man]] points out that this figure is larger than the population of any city in the world at that time and he calculates that the foundations could have been built by 16,000 men in two years.&lt;ref&gt;Man, John. ''The Terracotta Army'', Bantam Press 2007 p125. {{ISBN|978-0-593-05929-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Sima Qian never mentioned the [[Terracotta Army|terracotta army]], the statues were discovered by a group of farmers digging wells on March 29, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Ray.

[[File:Army of Terracotta.jpg|thumb|A few lifelike terracotta soldier statues from the [[Terracotta Army]], discovered near modern [[Xi'an]], which was meant to guard the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor]]]]

One of the first projects which the young king accomplished while he was alive was the construction of his own tomb. In 215 BC Qin Shi Huang ordered General [[Meng Tian]] to begin its construction with the assistance of 300,000 men.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt; Other sources suggest that he ordered 720,000 unpaid laborers to build his tomb according to his specifications.&lt;ref name="Ancient" /&gt; Again, given John Man's observation regarding populations at the time (see paragraph above), these historical estimates are debatable. The main tomb (located at {{Coord|34|22|52.75|N|109|15|13.06|E|type:landmark}}) containing the emperor has yet to be opened and there is evidence suggesting that it remains relatively intact.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Portal and Qingbo Duan, ''The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Arm'', British Museum Press, 2007, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sima Qian]]'s description of the tomb includes replicas of palaces and scenic towers, "rare utensils and wonderful objects", 100 rivers made with [[mercury (element)|mercury]], representations of "the [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]]", and [[crossbow]]s rigged to shoot anyone who tried to break in.&lt;ref&gt;Man, John. ''The Terracotta Army'', Bantam Press 2007 p170. {{ISBN|978-0-593-05929-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb was built at the foot of [[Mount Li]], 30 kilometers away from [[Xi'an]]. Modern archaeologists have located the tomb, and have inserted probes deep into it. The probes revealed abnormally high quantities of mercury, some 100 times the naturally occurring rate, suggesting that some parts of the legend are credible.&lt;ref name="wright" /&gt; Secrets were maintained, as most of the workmen who built the tomb were killed.&lt;ref name="wright" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leffman, David.

===Historiography===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--7 paragraphs without citations--&gt;

Traditional Chinese [[historiography]] almost always portrayed the First Emperor of the Chinese unified states as a brutal tyrant who had an obsessive fear of [[assassination]]. Ideological antipathy towards the [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalist]] State of Qin was established as early as 266 BC, when Confucian philosopher [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] disparaged it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Later Confucian historians condemned the emperor who had burned the classics and had buried Confucian scholars alive. They eventually compiled a list of the ''[[Ten Crimes of Qin]]'' to highlight his tyrannical actions.

The famous Han poet and statesman [[Jia Yi]] concluded his essay ''The Faults of Qin'' (過秦論, ''Guò Qín Lùn'') with what was to become the standard Confucian judgment of the reasons for Qin's collapse. Jia Yi's essay, admired as a masterpiece of rhetoric and reasoning, was copied into two great Han histories and has had a far-reaching influence on Chinese political thought as a classic illustration of Confucian theory.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe, Michael. Twitchett, Denis. (1986). ''The Cambridge History of China: Volume I: the Ch&amp;lsquo;in and Han Empires, 221 B.C. – A.D. 220''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-24327-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed Qin's disintegration to its internal failures.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, Julia. (2006). ''The Great Wall: China Against the World, 1000 BC-AD 2000''. Grove Press. {{ISBN|0-8021-1814-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8021-1814-1}}. pg 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Jia Yi wrote that:

{{quote|Qin, from a tiny base, had become a great power, ruling the land and receiving homage from all quarters for a hundred odd years. Yet after they unified the land and secured themselves within the pass, a single common rustic could nevertheless challenge this empire... Why? Because the ruler lacked humaneness and rightness; because preserving power differs fundamentally from seizing power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Sources of Chinese Tradition: Volume 1, From Earliest Times to 1600|others= Compiled by Wing-tsit Chan and Joseph Adler|year= 2000|publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn= 978-0-231-51798-0|page= 230}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In more modern times, historical assessment of the First Emperor different from traditional Chinese historiography began to emerge. The reassessment was spurred on by the weakness of China in the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century. At that time some began to regard Confucian traditions as an impediment to China's entry into the modern world, opening the way for changing perspectives.

At a time when foreign nations encroached upon Chinese territory, leading [[Kuomintang]] historian [[Xiao Yishan]] emphasized the role of Qin Shi Huang in repulsing the northern barbarians, particularly in the construction of the Great Wall.

Another historian, Ma Feibai (馬非百), published in 1941 a full-length [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] biography of the First Emperor entitled ''Qín Shǐ Huángdì Zhuàn'' (秦始皇帝傳), calling him "one of the great heroes of Chinese history". Ma compared him with the contemporary leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and saw many parallels in the careers and policies of the two men, both of whom he admired. Chiang's [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]] of the late 1920s, which directly preceded the new Nationalist government at [[Nanjing]] was compared to the unification brought about by Qin Shi Huang.

With the coming of the [[Chinese Civil War|Communist Revolution]] and the establishment of a new, revolutionary regime in 1949, another re-evaluation of the First Emperor emerged as a Marxist critique. This new interpretation of Qin Shi Huang was generally a combination of traditional and modern views, but essentially critical. This is exemplified in the ''Complete History of China'', which was compiled in September 1955 as an official survey of Chinese history. The work described the First Emperor's major steps toward unification and standardisation as corresponding to the interests of the ruling group and the [[merchant]] [[Social class|class]], not of the nation or the people, and the subsequent fall of his dynasty as a manifestation of the [[class struggle]]. The perennial debate about the fall of the Qin Dynasty was also explained in Marxist terms, the [[peasant]] rebellions being a revolt against oppression – a revolt which undermined the dynasty, but which was bound to fail because of a compromise with "[[landlord]] class elements".

Since 1972, however, a radically different official view of Qin Shi Huang in accordance with [[Maoism|Maoist]] thought has been given prominence throughout China. Hong Shidi's biography ''Qin Shi Huang'' initiated the re-evaluation. The work was published by the state press as a mass popular history, and it sold 1.85 million copies within two years. In the new era, Qin Shi Huang was seen as a far-sighted ruler who destroyed the forces of division and established the first unified, centralized state in Chinese history by rejecting the past. Personal attributes, such as his quest for immortality, so emphasized in traditional historiography, were scarcely mentioned. The new evaluations described approvingly how, in his time (an era of great political and social change), he had no compunctions against using violent methods to crush [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]], such as the "industrial and commercial slave owner" chancellor Lü Buwei. However, he was criticized for not being as thorough as he should have been, and as a result, after his death, hidden subversives under the leadership of the chief eunuch [[Zhao Gao]] were able to seize power and use it to restore the old feudal order.

To round out this re-evaluation, Luo Siding put forward a new interpretation of the precipitous collapse of the Qin Dynasty in an article entitled "On the Class Struggle During the Period Between Qin and Han" in a 1974 issue of ''Red Flag'', to replace the old explanation. The new theory claimed that the cause of the fall of Qin lay in the lack of thoroughness of Qin Shi Huang's "[[dictatorship]] over the reactionaries, even to the extent of permitting them to worm their way into organs of political authority and usurp important posts."

[[Mao Zedong]], chairman of the [[People's Republic of China]], was reviled{{by whom|date=August 2016}} for his persecution of intellectuals. On being compared to the First Emperor, Mao responded: &lt;blockquote&gt;"He buried 460 scholars alive; we have buried forty-six thousand scholars alive... You [intellectuals] revile us for being Qin Shi Huangs. You are wrong. We have surpassed Qin Shi Huang a hundredfold. When you berate us for imitating his despotism, we are happy to agree! Your mistake was that you did not say so enough."&lt;ref&gt;''Mao Zedong sixiang wan sui!'' (1969), p. 195. Referenced in ''Governing China'' (2nd ed.) by Kenneth Lieberthal (2004).

'''Reichsbund der Kinderreichen''' (RDK) or (RdK), ''Reich's Union of Large Families'' or, literally: ''"Reich's League of those wealthy in children"'', was one of the most important [[Natalism|pronatalist]] groups founded in Germany after [[World War I]].
To qualify as a member of this league a family should have at least four children. Widows were also admitted.

The German Large Family League was forcefully [[Gleichschaltung|nazified]] after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of power]] in 1933. As such its goal became the preservation and promotion of the German [[Eugenics|hereditarily healthy]] [[Aryan]] family ("Erhaltung und Förderung der deutschen, erbgesunden, arischen Familie").

==Renaming==
The RDK was renamed ''Reichsbund Deutsche Familie, Kampfbund für erbtüchtigen Kinderreichtum'' (German Family Reich's League, Struggle League for a Hereditarily Strong Offspring), in April 1940, in the first years of [[World War II]]. Its new acronym became '''RDF''' and Dr. [[Robert Kaiser (Nazi leader)|Robert Kaiser]] became its new leader.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IHoCE8WnETcC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=Reichsbund+der+Kinderreichen&amp;source=web&amp;ots=OpJRv3SamI&amp;sig=NToeSmoarzl1jgybTLstVtMiCpw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Lisa Pine, ''Nazi Family Policy, 1933-1945'']&lt;/ref&gt; Under Dr. Kaiser, the RDF became essentially a [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] organization, [[marriage promotion|promoting marriages]] and natality among the youth despite the war-related difficulties.

As a Nazi organization the German Large Family League was disbanded after Nazi Germany's [[Aftermath of World War II|defeat in World War II]]. The [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|American Military Government]] issued a special law outlawing the Nazi party and all of its branches. This [[Denazification]] decree was also known as "Law number five".

'''Religious naturalism''' ('''RN''') combines a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist worldview]] with perceptions and values commonly associated with religions.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Stone, Religious Naturalism Today, SUNY Press 2008, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Hogue, The Promise of Religious Naturalism, Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2010, pages xix-xx&lt;/ref&gt; In this, "religious" is understood in general terms, separate from established traditions, in designating feelings and concerns (e.g. gratitude, wonder, humility, compassion) that are often described as spiritual or religious.&lt;ref&gt;Varadaraja V. Raman, Book-jacket review of Loyal Rue's "Nature is Enough", SUNY Press 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, Nature is Enough, SUNY Press 2012, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cavanaugh, "What is Religious Naturalism?", Zygon 2000, page 242&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalism refers to a view that the natural world is all we have substantiated reason to believe exists, and there is no substantiated reason to believe that anything else, including deities, exists or may act in ways that are independent of the natural order.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, Nature is Enough, SUNY Press 2012, page 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wesley Wildman. Religious Naturalism: What It Can Be, and What It Need Not Be. Page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of inquiry include attempts to understand the natural world and the spiritual and moral implications of naturalist views.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ursula Goodenough, NPR 13.7 Blog, November 23, 2014: What is religious naturalism?&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding is based in knowledge obtained through scientific inquiry and insights from the humanities and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Hogue. Religion Without God: An Essay on Religious Naturalism. The Fourth R 27:3 (Spring 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Religious naturalists use these perspectives in responding to personal and social challenges (e.g. finding purpose, seeking justice, coming to terms with mortality) and in relating to the natural world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Naturalism==
Naturalism is the "idea or belief that only [[Physical law|natural]] (as opposed to [[supernatural]] or [[spiritualism|spiritual]]) laws and forces operate in the world".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/125337?redirectedFrom=naturalism   naturalism]&lt;/ref&gt;

All forms of religious naturalism, being [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] in their basic beliefs, assert that the natural world is the center of our most significant experiences and understandings. Consequently, [[nature]] is considered as the ultimate value in assessing one's being.  Religious naturalists, despite having followed differing cultural and individual paths, affirm the human need for meaning and value in their lives. They draw on two fundamental convictions in those quests: the sense of Nature's richness, spectacular complexity, and fertility, and the recognition that Nature is the only realm in which people live out their lives. Humans are considered interconnected parts of Nature.

[[Science]] is a fundamental, indispensable component of the paradigm of religious naturalism. It relies on mainstream science to reinforce religious and spiritual perspectives. Science is the primary interpretive tool for religious naturalism, because, scientific methods are thought to provide the most reliable understanding of Nature and the world, including human nature.

{{quote|"Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alhazen]] ([[Ibn Al-Haytham]]) ''Critique of Ptolemy'', translated by S. Pines, ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''' Ithaca 1962, as referenced in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.&lt;ref name=Sabra&gt;{{Harv|Sabra|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Religious==
[[File:Spiritual Tree dsc06786 duo nevit.jpg|thumb|206px|right|A religious attitude towards nature]]
Religious naturalists use the term "religious" to refer to an attitude – of being appreciative of and interested in concerns that have long been parts of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, Nature is Enough, State University of New York Press, 2011. Page 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varadaraja V. Raman. Back-cover review of Loyal Rue's "Nature is Enough"&lt;/ref&gt;
These include:&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough. Religious Naturalism and naturalizing morality. Zygon 38 2003: 101-109.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A spiritual sense (which may include a sense of mystery or wonder or feelings of reverence or awe in response to the scope and power and beauty of the natural world)
* A moral sense (with compassion, desire for justice, and attempts to do what is right – with respect to other people, other creatures, and the natural environment)
As the source of all that is and the reason why all things are as they are, the natural world may be seen as being of ultimate importance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Crosby. Living with Ambiguity: Religious Naturalism and the Menace of Evil, SUNY Press, 2008, page ix-x&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other religious orientations, religious naturalism includes '''a central story''' – a modern creation myth – to describe ourselves and our place in the world. This begins with the Big Bang and the emergence of galaxies, stars, planets, and life, and evolution that led to the presence of human beings. As this gives insight into who we are and how we came to be, religious naturalists look to the natural world (the source of our intelligence and inclinations) for information and insights that may help us to understand and respond to important questions: 
* Why do we want what we want?
* Why we do the things we do?
* What we might try to point ourselves toward?
and to try to find ways to minimize problems (in ourselves and in our world), become our better selves, and relate to others and the world we are part of.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, Nature is Enough, State University of New York Press, 2011. Pages 93-96&lt;/ref&gt;

When discussing distinctions between "religious" naturalists and "plain old" (secular) naturalists, Loyal Rue said:
"I regard a religious or spiritual person to be one who takes ultimate concerns to heart."&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, Nature is Enough, State University of New York Press, 2011. Page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

He noted that, while "plain old" naturalists are concerned with morals and may have emotional responses to the mysteries and wonders of the world, those who describe themselves as religious naturalists take it more "to heart" and show active interest in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, Nature is Enough, State University of New York Press, 2011. Pages 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Core themes in religious naturalism have been present, in varied cultures, for centuries. But active discussion, with use of this name, is relatively recent.

[[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BCE, a founder of [[Stoicism]]) said:
{{quote|All things are parts of one single system, which is called Nature ... Virtue consists in a will which is in agreement with Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sharon M. Kaye |author2=Paul Thomson |title= Philosophy for Teens: Questioning Life's Big Ideas, |publisher=Prufrock Press Inc. |date=2006 |page=72 |isbn= 9781593632021}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Views consistent with religious naturalism can be seen in ancient Daoist texts (e.g., Dao De Jing) and some Hindu views (such as God as Nirguṇa Brahman, God without attributes). They may also be seen in Western images that do not focus on active, personal aspects of God, such as Thomas Aquinas' view of God as Pure Act, Augustine's God as Being Itself, and Paul Tillich's view of God as Ground of Being. As [[Wesley Wildman]] has described, views consistent with RN have long existed as part of the underside of major religious traditions, often quietly and sometimes in mystical strands or intellectual sub-traditions, by practitioners who are not drawn to supernatural claims.&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, Wesley. Religious Naturalism: What It Can Be, and What It Need Not Be. Philosophy, Theology, and the Sciences. 1(1). 2014. Pages 49-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest uses of the term, religious naturalism, seem to have occurred in the 1800s. In 1846, the ''[[American Whig Review]]'' described "a seeming 'religious naturalism'",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=George Hooker Colton |author2=[[James Davenport Whelpley]] |title=The American Review: A Whig Journal, Devoted to Politics and Literature |date= 1846 |page= 282 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqzxIayzYN8C&amp;pg=PA282&amp;vq=religious+naturalism&amp;dq=religious+naturalism+date:1840-1850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, American Unitarian Association literature adjudged:"Religious naturalism differs from this mainly in the fact that it extends the domain of nature farther outward into space and time. ...It never transcends nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89097267090;view=1up;seq=26 |title=Athanasia |publisher=American Unitarian Association |date=1870 |page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] wrote that religious naturalism was "the acknowledgment of the Divine in Nature" and also "an element of the Christian religion", but by no means that religion's definitive "characteristic" or "tendency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ludwig Feuerbach |author2=George Eliot |title= The Essence of Christianity |work=Religion |date= 1881 |page=103 |url=
https://books.google.com/books?id=ArMHAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=The+Essence+of+Christianity&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Trübner }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LaoGod.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lao Tzu]], traditionally the author of the [[Tao Te Ching]]]] In 1864, Pope [[Pius IX]] condemned religious naturalism in the first seven articles of the [[Syllabus of Errors]].

[[Mordecai Kaplan]] (1881–1983), one of the great rabbis of the 20th century and the founder of the Jewish [[Reconstructionist Judaism|reconstructionism]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;Alex J. Goldman - The greatest rabbis hall of fame, SP Books, 1987, page 342, {{ISBN|0933503148}}&lt;/ref&gt; early advocated religious naturalism. He believed that a naturalistic approach to religion and ethics was possible in a desacralizing world. He saw God as the sum of all natural processes.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Emanuel S. Goldsmith - Reconstructionism Today  Spring 2001, Volume 8, Number 3,
[http://jrf.org/showrt&amp;rid=524 Jewish Reconstructionist Federation] retrieved 4-1-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Other verified usages of the term came in 1940 from George Perrigo Conger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Perrigo Conger |title= The Ideologies of Religion |date=1940 |page= 212 |url=
https://books.google.com/?id=EK9ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=religious+naturalism+date:1938-1942 |accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Edgar S. Brightman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edgar S |last=Brightman |title= God as the Tendency of Nature to Support or Produce Values (Religious Naturalism) |work=A Philosophy of Religion |date=1940 |page= 148  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jrBAAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=religious+naturalism+date:1940-1950&amp;dq=religious+naturalism+date:1940-1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, H. H. Dubs wrote an article entitled ''Religious Naturalism – an Evaluation'' (The Journal of Religion, XXIII: 4, October, 1943), which begins "Religious naturalism is today one of the outstanding American philosophies of religion…" and discusses ideas developed by [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] in books that predate Dubs's article by 20 years.

In 1991 [[Jerome A. Stone]] wrote ''The Minimalist Vision of Transcendence'' explicitly "to sketch a philosophy of religious naturalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerome A |last=Stone |title=The Minimalist Vision of Transcendence |date= 1991 |page= 9  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ujRONh8cw8UC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=religious+naturalism+date:1990-1996 |isbn=9780791411599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term was expanded in the 1990s by [[Loyal Rue]], who was familiar with the term from Brightman's book. Rue used the term in conversations with several people before 1994, and subsequent conversations between Rue and [[Ursula Goodenough]] [both of whom were active in IRAS (The [[Institute on Religion in an Age of Science]]) led to Goodenough's use in her book "The Sacred Depths of Nature" and by Rue in "Religion is not about God" and other writings. Since 1994 numerous authors have used the phrase or expressed similar thinking. Examples are [[Chet Raymo]], [[Stuart Kauffman]] and [[Karl E. Peters]].

[[File:UrsulaG.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ursula Goodenough]]]]
Mike Ignatowski states that "there were many religious naturalists in the first half of the 20th century and some even before that" but that "religious naturalism as a movement didn't really come into its own until about 1990 [and] took a major leap forward in 1998 when Ursula Goodenough published The Sacred Depths of Nature, which is considered one of the founding texts of this movement."&lt;ref name="uucckingston.org"&gt;{{cite book |title=Religious Naturalism |first= Mike |last=Ignatowski |location=Kingston |date=June 25, 2006 |url=http://www.uucckingston.org/Sermons/naturalism.html |accessdate= 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist Ursula Goodenough states:
{{quote|I profess my Faith. For me, the existence of all this complexity and awareness and intent and beauty, and my ability to apprehend it, serves as the ultimate meaning and the ultimate value. The continuation of life reaches around, grabs its own tail, and forms a sacred circle that requires no further justification, no Creator, no super-ordinate meaning of meaning, no purpose other than that the continuation continue until the sun collapses or the final meteor collides.

And in so doing, I confess as well a credo of human continuation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ursula |last=Goodenough |title=The Sacred Depths of Nature |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |date=2000 |page= 171 |isbn=0195136292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/moralityofnature/kristasjournal.shtml |title=Video Interview - Speaking of Faith |publisher=Krista's Journal |date=April 7, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011194453/http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/moralityofnature/kristasjournal.shtml |archivedate=October 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Jerome A. Stone.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jerome A. Stone]]]]
''Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative'' is a history by Dr. Jerome A. Stone (Dec. 2008 release) that presents this paradigm as a once-forgotten option in religious thinking that is making a rapid revival. It seeks to explore and encourage religious ways of responding to the world on a completely naturalistic basis without a supreme being or ground of being. This book traces this history and analyzes some of the issues dividing religious naturalists. It covers the birth of religious naturalism, from [[George Santayana]] to [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] and briefly explores religious naturalism in literature and art. Contested issues are discussed including whether nature's power or goodness is the focus of attention and also on the appropriateness of using the term "God". The contributions of more than twenty living Religious Naturalists are presented. The last chapter ends the study by exploring what it is like on the inside to live as a religious naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/details.asp?id=61660 ''Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Chet Raymo writes that he had come to the same conclusion as [[Teilhard de Chardin]]: "Grace is everywhere",&lt;ref&gt;''When God is Gone Everything is Holy – The Making of a Religious Naturalist'', Chet Raymo, 2008, p 136&lt;/ref&gt; and that naturalistic emergence is in everything and far more magical than religion-based miracles. A future humankind religion should be ecumenical, ecological, and embrace the story provided by science as the "most reliable cosmology".&lt;ref&gt;Chet Raymo - When God is Gone Everything is Holy, Soren Books, 2008, page 114, {{ISBN|1-933495-13-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As P. Roger Gillette summarizes:
{{quote|Thus was religious naturalism born. It takes the findings of modern science seriously, and thus is inherently naturalistic. But it also takes the human needs that led to the emergence of religious systems seriously, and thus is also religious. It is religious, or reconnective, in that it seeks and facilitates human reconnection with one's self, family, larger human community, local and global ecosystem, and unitary universe (…) Religious reconnection implies love. And love implies concern, concern for the well-being of the beloved. Religious naturalism thus is marked by concern for the well-being of the whole of nature. This concern provides a basis and drive for ethical behavior toward the whole holy unitary universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=P. Roger |last=Gillette |title=Theology Of, By, &amp; For Religious Naturalism |url=http://meadville.edu/LL_JLR_v6_n1_Gillette.htm |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114051623/http://meadville.edu/LL_JLR_v6_n1_Gillette.htm |archivedate=2009-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Tenets==
Due to the high importance placed on nature, some religious naturalists have a strong sense of stewardship for the Earth. Luther College professor Loyal Rue has written:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religious naturalists will be known for their reverence and awe before Nature, their love for Nature and natural forms, their sympathy for all living things, their guilt for enlarging the ecological footprints, their pride in reducing them, their sense of gratitude directed towards the matrix of life, their contempt for those who abstract themselves from natural values, and their solidarity with those who link their self-esteem to sustainable living.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal D. Rue - ''RELIGION is not about god'', Rutgers University Press, 2005, page 367, {{ISBN|0813535115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Varieties==
The literature related to religious naturalism includes many variations in conceptual framing. This reflects individual takes on various issues, to some extent various schools of thought, such as basic [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], [[religious humanism]], [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]], and [[spiritual naturalism]] that have had time on the conceptual stage, and to some extent differing ways of characterizing Nature.

Current discussion often relates to the issue of whether belief in a God or God-language and associated concepts have any place in a framework that treats the physical universe as its essential frame of reference and the methods of science as providing the preeminent means for determining what Nature is. There are at least three varieties of religious naturalism, and three similar but somewhat different ways to categorize them. They are:

:*A kind of naturalism that '''does''' use theological language but fundamentally treats God metaphorically.

:*A commitment to naturalism '''using theological language, but''' as either (1) a faith statement or supported by philosophical arguments, or (2) both, usually leaving open the question of whether that usage as [[metaphor]] or refers to the ultimate answer that Nature can be.

:*'''Neo-theistic''' ([[process theology]], progressive religions)&amp;nbsp;– Gordon Kaufman, [[Karl E. Peters]], [[Ralph Wendell Burhoe]], Edmund Robinson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rev. Edmund |last=Robinson |url=http://archive.uua.org/ga/ga02/2029.html |title=2029 Presentation of Skinner Award-Winning Social Justice Sermon |publisher=archive.uua.org |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719082405/http://archive.uua.org/ga/ga02/2029.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*'''Non-theistic''' ([[agnostic]], naturalistic concepts of god)&amp;nbsp;– Robertson himself, [[Stanley A. Klein|Stanley Klein]], [[Stuart Kauffman]], Naturalistic Paganism.

:*'''atheistic''' (no God concept, some modern naturalisms, Process Naturalism, C. Robert Mesle, non-militant [[atheism]], [[antitheism]])&amp;nbsp;– Jerome A. Stone, Michael Cavanaugh, [[Donald A. Crosby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0791454541 |title=A Religion of Nature  |first=Donald A |last=Crosby |publisher=amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ursula Goodenough, [[Daniel Dennett]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5tGpMcFF7U&lt;/ref&gt;

:*A hodgepodge of '''individual perspectives'''&amp;nbsp;– [[Philip Hefner]]

The first category has as many sub-groups as there are distinct definitions for god. Believers in a supernatural entity ([[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]) are by definition not religious naturalists however the matter of a naturalistic concept of God ([[Immanence]]) is currently debated. [[Weak and strong atheism|Strong atheists]] are not considered Religious Naturalists in this differentiation. Some individuals call themselves religious naturalists but refuse to be categorized. The unique theories of religious naturalists [[Loyal Rue]], [[Donald A. Crosby]], [[Jerome A. Stone]], and [[Ursula Goodenough]] are discussed by Michael Hogue in his 2010 book'' The Promise of Religious Naturalism''.&lt;ref&gt;The Promise of Religious Naturalism&amp;nbsp;– Michael Hogue, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., Sept.16, 2010, {{ISBN|0742562611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''God concepts'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rev. Dr. Jerome Stone's Presentation |url=http://archive.uua.org/ga/ga06/3062.html |title=3062 Religious Naturalism: A New Theological Option |accessdate=29 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719082408/http://archive.uua.org/ga/ga06/3062.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Those who conceive of God as the '''creative process within the universe'''&amp;nbsp;– example, Henry Nelson Wieman

:*Those who think of God as the '''totality of the universe''' considered religiously&amp;nbsp;– [[Bernard Loomer]].

:*A third type of religious naturalism sees '''no need to use the concept or terminology of God''', Stone himself and Ursula Goodenough

Stone emphasizes that some Religious Naturalists do not reject the concept of God, but if they use the concept, it involves a radical alteration of the idea such as Gordon Kaufman who defines God as creativity.

Ignatowski divides RN into only two types&amp;nbsp;– theistic and non-theistic.&lt;ref name="uucckingston.org"/&gt;

==Shared principles==
[[File:Biological classification L Pengo tweaked.svg|thumb|150px|[[Biological classification]]]]
There are several principles shared by all the aforementioned varieties of religious naturalism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature |title= Introduction, page xviii |url=http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/sample/Taylor--introduction.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*All varieties of religious naturalism see humans as an interconnected, [[Emergence|emergent]] part of nature.
*Accept the primacy of science with regard to what is measurable via the [[scientific method]].
*Recognize science's limitations in accounting for judgments of value and in providing a full account of human experience.  Thus religious naturalism embraces nature's creativity, beauty and mystery and honors many aspects of the artistic, cultural and religious traditions that respond to and attempt to interpret Nature in subjective ways.
*Approach matters of morality, ethics and value with a focus on how the world works, with a deep concern for fairness and the welfare of all humans regardless of their station in life.
*Seek to integrate these interpretative, spiritual and ethical responses in a manner that respects diverse religious and philosophical perspectives, while still subjecting them and itself to rigorous scrutiny.
*The focus on scientific standards of evidence imbues RN with the humility inherent in scientific inquiry and its limited, albeit ever deepening, ability to describe reality (see [[Epistemology]]).
*A strong environmental ethic for the welfare of the planet Earth and humanity.
*Belief in the sacredness of life and the evolutionary process

The concept of [[emergence]] has grown in popularity with many Religious Naturalists. It helps explain how a complex Universe and life by [[self-organization]] have risen out of a multiplicity of relatively simple elements and their interactions. The entire story of emergence is related in the [[Epic of Evolution]] – the mythic scientific narrative used to tell the verifiable chronicle of the evolutionary process that is the Universe. Most religious naturalist consider the Epic of Evolution a true story about the historic achievement of Nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/HowGrand.pdf ''How Grand a Narrative''– Ursula Goodenough]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;" [http://www.thegreatstory.org/EpicStoryNarrative.pdf ''Epic, Story, Narrative'' – Bill Bruehl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/HowGrand.pdf ''How Grand a Narrative'' – Philip Hefner]&lt;/ref&gt; ''"The Epic of Evolution is the 14 billion year narrative of cosmic, planetary, life, and cultural evolution—told in sacred ways. Not only does it bridge mainstream science and a diversity of religious traditions; if skillfully told, it makes the science story memorable and deeply meaningful, while enriching one's religious faith or secular outlook."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Epic of Evolution |date= 2004 |encyclopedia=Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature |url=http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of naturalistic writers have used this theme as a topic for their books using such synonyms as: Cosmic Evolution, Everybody's Story, Evolutionary Epic, Evolutionary Universe, Great Story, New Story, Universal Story. ''{{'}}Epic of evolution' is a term that, within the past three years(1998), has become the theme and title of a number of gatherings. It seems to have been first used by Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson in 1978. 'The evolutionary epic,' Wilson wrote in his book On Human Nature, 'is probably the best myth we will ever have.' Myth as falsehood was not the usage intended by Wilson in this statement. Rather, myth as a grand narrative that provides a people with a placement in time—a meaningful placement that celebrates extraordinary moments of a shared heritage. The epic of evolution is science translated into meaningful story."''&lt;ref&gt;Connie Barlow  -  ''The Epic of Evolution: Religious and cultural interpretations of modern scientific cosmology''. [http://www.science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=31 Science &amp; Spirit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523211715/http://science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=31 |date=2006-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary evangelist minister [[Michael Dowd]] uses the term to help present his  position that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive (a premise of religious naturalism). He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe. Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thankgodforevolution.com/book |title=Thank God for Evolution |publisher=thankgodforevolution.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is joined by a number of other theologians in this position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugenie Carol Scott]], Niles Eldredge, Contributor Niles Eldredge,  -  ''Evolution Vs.

==Notable proponents and critics==

===Proponents===
Support for religious naturalism can be seen from two perspectives. One is individuals, in recent times, who have discussed and supported religious naturalism, per se. Another is individuals from earlier times who may not have used or been familiar with the term, "religious naturalism", but who had views that are compatible and whose thoughts have contributed to development of religious naturalism.

People who have been supportive of and who discussed religious naturalism by name include:

*[[Aldo Leopold]]

{{div col end}}

===Critics===
Religious naturalism has been criticized from two perspectives. One is that of traditional Western religion, which disagrees with naturalist disbelief in a personal God. Another is that of naturalists who do not agree that a religious sense can or should be associated with naturalist views. Critics in the first group include supporters of traditional Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religion. Critics in the second group include:
*[[Richard Dawkins]] &lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion, Houghton Mifflin 2006, pages 14,15,19&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[John Haught]] &lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, Nature is Enough, SUNY Press 2011, pages 116-122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent communities and leaders==
Religious naturalists sometimes use the social practices of traditional religions, including communal gatherings and rituals, to foster a sense of community, and to serve as reinforcement of its participants' efforts to expand the scope of their understandings. Some other groups mainly communicate online. Some known examples of religious naturalists groupings and congregation leaders are:&lt;ref&gt;Jerome A.

'''Roderick Milton Chisholm''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɪ|z|ə|m}}; November 27, 1916 – January 19, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary Of Modern American Philosophers (2005), p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[American philosopher]] known for his work on [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[free will]], [[value theory]], and the [[philosophy of perception]]. He was often called "the philosopher's philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opencourtbooks.com/books_n/philosophy_chisholm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

Chisholm graduated from [[Brown University]] in 1938 and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1942 under [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] and [[Donald Cary Williams|Donald C. Williams]].  He was drafted into the United States Army in July 1942 and did basic training at [[Fort McClellan]] in [[Alabama]]. Chisholm administered psychological tests in [[Boston]] and [[New Haven]]. In 1943 he married Eleanor Parker, whom he had met as an undergraduate at Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chisholm|first=Roderick|title=The philosophy of Roderick M. Chisholm|year=1997|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8126-9357-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent his academic career at [[Brown University]] and served as president of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] in 1973.

Chisholm trained many distinguished philosophers, including   [[Selmer Bringsjord]], [[Fred Feldman (philosopher)|Fred Feldman]], [[Keith Lehrer]], [[James Francis Ross]], [[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]], and [[Dean Zimmerman]].    He also had a significant influence on many colleagues, including [[Jaegwon Kim]] and [[Ernest Sosa]].

==Philosophical work==

Chisholm's first major work was ''Perceiving'' (1957).  His epistemological views were summed up in a popular text, ''Theory of Knowledge'', which appeared in three very different editions (1966, 1977, and 1989). His masterwork was ''Person and Object'', its title deliberately contrasting with [[W. V. O. Quine]]'s ''[[Word and Object]]''. Chisholm was a metaphysical [[Platonist]] in the tradition of [[Bertrand Russell]], and a [[rationalist]] in the tradition of Russell, [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Franz Brentano]]; he objected to Quine's [[anti-realism]], [[behaviorism]], and [[relativism]].

Chisholm defended the possibility of empirical knowledge by appeal to ''a priori'' epistemic principles whose consequences include that it is more reasonable to trust your senses and memory in most situations than to doubt them. His theory of knowledge was also famously "foundationalist" in character:  all justified beliefs are either "directly evident" or supported by chains of justified beliefs that ultimately lead to beliefs that are directly evident.  He also defended a controversial theory of volition called "agent causation" much like that of [[Thomas Reid]].  He argued that free will is incompatible with determinism, and believed that we do act freely; this combination of views is known as [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]].  {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} He developed a highly original theory of first person thought according to which the things we believe are properties, and believing them is a matter of self-attributing them.  (A similar view was developed independently by [[David Kellogg Lewis]], and enjoys considerable popularity, although it is now known mainly through Lewis's work.)  Chisholm was also famous for defending the possibility of robust self-knowledge (against the [[Skepticism|skeptical]] arguments of [[David Hume]]), and an objective ethics of requirements similar to that of [[W. D. Ross]]. Chisholm's other books include ''The Problem of the Criterion'', ''Perceiving'', ''The First Person'' and ''A Realist Theory of the Categories'', though his numerous journal articles are probably better known than any of these.

Chisholm read widely in the history of philosophy, and frequently referred to the work of Ancient, Medieval, Modern, and even Continental philosophers (although the use he made of this material has sometimes been challenged). Nonetheless, he greatly respected the history of philosophy, in the face of a prevailing indifference among analytic philosophers. Chisholm translated some work by Brentano and by Husserl, and contributed to the post-1970 renaissance of [[mereology]].

===Direct attribution theory of reference===&lt;!-- "Direct attribution theory of reference" redirects here --&gt;
Chisholm argued for the primacy of the [[mind|mental]] over [[linguistics|linguistic]] [[intentionality]], as suggested in the title of ''Person and Object'' (1976) that was deliberately contrasted with Quine's ''Word and Object'' (1960). In this regard, he defended the '''direct attribution theory of reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in ''The First Person'' (1981). He argues that we refer to things other than ourselves by indirectly attributing properties to them, and that we indirectly or relatively attribute properties to them by directly attributing properties to ourselves. Suppose the following bed scene:

:(1) a man M is in bed B with a woman W, namely, M-B-W, or
:(2) a woman W is in bed B with a man M, namely, W-B-M.

If I were M and "U" were W, then I could directly attribute to myself the property (1) or M-B-W, while indirectly to "U" the property (2) or W-B-M, ''thereby referring to "U"''. That is, to say (1) is ''relatively'' to say (2), or to explicate M-B-W is to implicate W-B-M.

His idea of indirect attribution (1981) is relevant to [[John Searle]]'s "[[Speech act#Indirect speech acts|indirect speech act]]" (1975) and [[Paul Grice]]'s "[[implicature]]" (1975), in addition to [[Logical consequence|entailment]].

==="Chisholming"===
Stylistically, Chisholm was known for formulating definitions and subsequently revising them in the light of counterexamples. This led to a joke definition of a new verb:&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Richard and Feldman, Fred, "Roderick Chisholm", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/chisholm/&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|text=chisholm, v. To make repeated small alterations in a definition or example. “He started with definition (d.8) and kept chisholming away at it until he ended up with (d.8′′′′′′′′).”|sign=[[Daniel Dennett]] and Asbjørn Steglich-Petersen|source=[http://www.philosophicallexicon.com/ ''The Philosophical Lexicon''], 2008}}
While intended as a joke, the term has found some use in serious philosophical papers (for example,&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Meeker. Chisholming away at Plantinga's critique of epistemic deontology. ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy''. Volume 76, Issue 1, 1998, pp. 90-96&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Ross Bolleter''' (born 1946, [[Subiaco, Western Australia]]) is a composer and musician whose work is focused on ruined pianos. His recordings are available on Emanem ([[London]]), Pogus (New York), New Albion ([[San Francisco]]) and Tall Poppies ([[Sydney]]), as well as on his WARPS (World Association for Ruined Piano Studies) label.

==Career==

===Music===
Bolleter studied the music theory as well as its history and composition at the [[University of Western Australia]] between 1964 and 1967. This fired his interest in the music of composers such as Webern, Boulez and Cage. After playing the piano for six years at the Parmelia Hilton, he explored non-conventional timbral and rhythmic possibilities of the prepared piano and released a cassette, ''The Temple of Joyous Bones'', which featured the piano. Bolleter found inspiration in the eighties playing and recording improvised music with flautist [[Tos Mahoney]] and double bassist, [[Ryszard Ratajczak]].

Over the past thirty years Bolleter has explored the timbral possibilities of ruined pianos, as quoted: old pianos that have been exposed to the elements of time and weather thus acquiring novel and unexpected musical possibilities. A piano is ruined (rather than neglected or devastated) when it has been abandoned to all weathers and has become a decaying box of unpredictable dongs, tonks and dedoomps. The notes that don’t work are at least as interesting as those that do.

Ross Bolleter has five ruined pianos in his kitchen including the original ruined piano from Nallan Sheep Station, near Cue, 800&amp;nbsp;km north east of Perth, Western Australia. At Kim Hack’s and Penny Mossops’s olive farm, Wambyn, near York, Western Australia, Kim Hack and Bolleter developed the Ruined Piano Sanctuary, where some forty pianos are ruining in their own ways, and at their own pace, variously under trees, in dams, and on roofs. Bolleter's recent CD ''Frontier Piano,'' which represents the best of his work from 2007–2014, is almost entirely devoted to recordings of these dying pianos. Each piano in decay is a long-running composition. Death comes to every piano, and dying, each sings a different kind of song.

In 1989 Bolleter set up the Synchronicity Project where he devised a series of intuitive pieces where musicians improvised simultaneously but in different centres in [[Australia]] and across the world. In several instances these pieces were set up to cast a net for synchronistic events, especially musical synchronicities. The Synchronicity Project produced a series of radiophonic works. The first of these works was Simulplay 1 (September 1989) had [[Jim Denley]] playing [[flute]] to a live audience at the B rucknerhaus in the Ars Electronica in Linz, [[Austria]] – with Bolleter playing [[piano]] and [[accordion]], together with [[Carol Henning]] playing plastic [[trombone]], in the ABC radio studios, Perth. The second work, That Time/Simulplay 2 – an intuitive piece for two musicians on opposite sides of a continent, playing at precisely the same time but unable to hear each other, while a radio audience hears both of them – involved Ryszard Ratajczak playing [[double bass]] in Studio 210 of ABC FM Sydney with Bolleter playing both pianos in separate recordings in ABC’s Studio 621, Perth. That Time/Simulplay 2 was released on the Pogus label, New York, as part of the album Crow Country in 2000. &lt;Ross Bolleter and Rowan Hammond:“Improvising with synchronistic experiences” in NMA 9, Melbourne, 1991&gt;

Another radiophonic piece Pocket Sky: a worldwide link up between Jim Denley (Radio ORF Vienna), Stevie Wishart (BBC London), David Moss (SFR Berlin), Jon Rose (ABC Sydney), Simone de Haan (ABC Melbourne), and Bolleter (ABC Perth), took place on 21 October 1991. It was released as the CD Pocket Sky (2004) (WARPS W08).

Bolleter’s 1996 piece Left Hand of the Universe CD (WARPS W02)) linked up Michal Murin and other Slovak and Czech musicians in [[Bratislava]], and Stephen Scott and various musicians at [[Colorado College]], without recourse to radio. All the musicians were playing ruined instruments, or were in the process of ruining them. Left Hand of the Universe was released on CD in 1997 as WARPS W02.

Bolleter's output also includes two CDs of café music: ''Paradise Café'' and ''Café Sophia'' which feature him playing the accordion, his film music, and his songs. Bolleter's songs, sung by Anthony Cormican, are also featured on their CD ''Songs from the Third Watch''. This CD includes Bolleter's setting of Kenneth Slessor's 1937 poem ''Five Bells'' and Cormican's setting of Billy Strayhorn's ''Lush Life''.

Bolleter has released more than twenty CDs, primarily of ruined piano compositions and improvisations. His CD ''Crow Country'', released on the Pogus label as Pogus 7 6034-21021-2 (New York, 2000.), was nominated as one of the 10 best albums of 1999 by ''Cadence Magazine ''(New York) and constitutes the best of his work from 1988 to 1999. ''Secret Sandhills and Satellites'', released on the Emanem label, London, UK (2006), was voted best CD of September 2006 by ''[[Blow Up (magazine)|Blow Up]]'' magazine (Italy), and number two CD of the year by ''dMute'' Magazine (Jazz and Improvised Music), France. ''Secret Sandhills and Satellites ''presents the best of Bolleter's work from 2001 to 2006.

Bolleter has performed with a variety of artists including Kavisha Mazzella, Tos Mahoney, Ryszard Ratajczak, Mark Cain, K.K.Null, Jim Denley, Jon Rose, David Moss, Simone de Haan, Michal Murin, Zdenek Plachy, Milan Adanciak, Stephen Scott, David Kotlowy, and Richard Lynn – as well as with bands such as the [[The Blackeyed Susans|Black Eyed Susans]]. From 2000 to 2016, he has worked with producer/composer Anthony Cormican in a collaboration uniting Anthony's work with the music editing program Protools with his own ultra-low tech ruined pianos. Since 2010, Bolleter has collaborated with the visual artist and composer Antoinette Carrier in work which includes her woven pianos as well as her creation of the first urban Piano Sanctuary in Bedford, Western Australia. Carrier's CD ''Nothing as a Thing'' was released on the WARPS label.

Bolleter performed as an accordionist/story teller at the Adelaide Festival of 1998, and on ruined piano(s) at the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM) in "Piano!" (2009), in the Ten Days on the Island Festival, where he created the project "Ruined" (2008) and in various of Tura New Music’s Totally Huge New Music Festivals under the artistic direction of Tos Mahoney, beginning with the Ruined Piano Convergence of 2005. Bolleter’s work is regularly featured on ABC’s Radio National and ABC FM.

Film maker [[Robert Castiglione]] has made a film of Bolleter’s work with ruined pianos entitled ''Invitation to Ruin.'' It was shown in Tura's Totally Huge New Music Festival of 2015. Andrew Ford, in his book ''In Defence of Classical Music''&lt;ABC Books&gt;&lt;Sydney, 2005&gt; has a chapter on Bolleter's work entitled Things fall apart in the music of Ross Bolleter.

'''''Spiritual materialism''''' is a term coined by [[Chögyam Trungpa]] in his book ''[[Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism]]''. The book is a compendium of his talks explaining Buddhism given while opening the Karma Dzong meditation center in [[Boulder, Colorado]].  He expands on the concept in later seminars that became books such as ''[[Work, Sex, Money]]''.  He uses the term to describe mistakes spiritual seekers commit which turn the pursuit of spirituality into an [[Ego (spirituality)|ego]] building and confusion creating endeavor, based on the idea that ego development is counter to spiritual progress.&lt;ref name="Ferrer35"&gt;Ferrer (2001) p.35&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conventionally, it is used to describe [[capitalism|capitalist]] and spiritual [[narcissism]], commercial efforts such as "new age" bookstores and wealthy lecturers on spirituality; it might also mean the attempt to build up a list of credentials or accumulate teachings in order to present oneself as a more realized or holy person.&lt;ref name="Potter102"&gt;Potter and Potter (2006) pp.102-103&lt;/ref&gt; Author Jorge Ferrer equates the terms "Spiritual materialism" and "Spiritual Narcissism",&lt;ref name="Ferrer35" /&gt; though others draw a distinction, that spiritual [[narcissism]] is believing that one deserves love and respect&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integralworld.net/larsson.html SPIRITUAL NARCISSISM by V. GUNNAR LARSSON]&lt;/ref&gt; or is better than another&lt;ref&gt;Hart (2004) p.218&lt;/ref&gt; because one has accumulated spiritual training instead of the belief that accumulating training will bring an end to suffering.

==Lords of Materialism==
In Trungpa's presentation, spiritual materialism can fall into three categories&amp;nbsp;— what he calls the three "Lords of Materialism" (Tibetan: ''lalo'' literally "barbarian")&amp;nbsp;— in which a form of materialism is misunderstood as bringing long term happiness but instead brings only short term entertainment followed by long term suffering:

# Physical materialism is the belief that possessions can bring release from suffering. In Trungpa's view, they may bring temporary happiness but then more suffering in the endless pursuit of creating one's environment to be just right. Or on another level it may cause a misunderstanding like, "I am rich because I have this or that" or "I am a teacher (or whatever) because I have a diploma (or whatever)."
# Psychological materialism is the belief that a particular philosophy, belief system, or point of view will bring release from suffering. So seeking refuge by strongly identifying with a particular religion,&lt;ref&gt;Carson (2003) p.20&lt;/ref&gt; philosophy, political party or viewpoint, for example, would be psychological materialism. From this the conventional usage of spiritual materialism arises, by identifying oneself as Buddhist or some other label, or by collecting initiations and spiritual accomplishments, one further constructs a solidified view of ego.&lt;ref name="Potter102" /&gt;  Trungpa characterizes the goal of psychological materialism as using external concepts, pretexts, and ideas to prove that the ego-driven self exists, which manifests in a particular competitive attitude.&lt;ref name="WSM"&gt;Trungpa (2011), p.14-15&lt;/ref&gt;
# Spiritual materialism is the belief that a certain temporary state of mind is a refuge from suffering. An example would be using meditation practices to create a peaceful state of mind, or using drugs or alcohol to remain in a numbed out or a euphoric state. According to Trungpa, these states are temporary and merely heighten the suffering when they cease. So attempting to maintain a particular emotional state of mind as a refuge from suffering, or constantly pursuing particular emotional states of mind like being in love, will actually lead to more long term suffering.

==Ego==
The underlying source of these three approaches to finding happiness is based, according to Trungpa, on the mistaken notion that one's [[Ego (spirituality)|ego]] is inherently existent and a valid point of view. He claims that is incorrect, and therefore the materialistic approaches have an invalid basis to begin with. The message in summary is, "Don't try to reinforce your ego through material things, belief systems like religion, or certain emotional states of mind." In his view, the point of religion is to show you that your ego doesn't really exist inherently. Ego is something you build up to make you think you exist, but it is not necessary and in the long run causes more suffering.

'''''The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values''''' is a book by [[Sam Harris]] published in 2010. In it, he promotes a [[science of morality]] and argues that many thinkers have long confused the relationship between morality, facts, and science. He aims to carve a third path between secularists who say morality is subjective (e.g. [[ethical relativism|moral relativists]]), and religionists who say that morality is given by God and scripture. Harris contends that the only moral framework worth talking about is one where "morally good" things pertain to increases in the "well-being of conscious creatures". He then argues that, problems with philosophy of science and reason in general notwithstanding, 'moral questions' will have objectively right and wrong answers which are grounded in empirical facts about what causes people to flourish.

Challenging the traditional philosophical notion that humans can never get an 'ought' from an 'is' (the so called [[Hume's law]]), Harris argues that moral questions are best pursued using not just philosophy, but the [[scientific method|methods of science]]. Thus, "science can determine human values" translates to "science can tell us which values lead to human flourishing". It is in this sense that Harris advocates that scientists begin conversations about a normative science of "morality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samharris.org/ |title=Sam Harris |publisher=Sam Harris |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Primary sources|synopsis|date=August 2012}}
Sam Harris's case starts with two premises: "(1) some people have better lives than others, and (2) these differences are related, in some lawful and not entirely arbitrary way, to states of the human brain and to states of the world".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that a person is simply describing material facts (many about their brain) when they describe possible "better" and "worse" lives for themselves. Granting this, Harris says we must conclude that there are facts about which courses of action will allow one to pursue a better life.

Harris attests to the importance of admitting that such facts exist, because he says this logic applies to groups of individuals as well. He suggests that there are better and worse ways for whole societies to pursue better lives. Just like at the scale of the individual, there may be multiple different paths and "peaks" to flourishing for societies - and many more ways to fail.

Harris then makes a case that science could usefully define "morality" according to such facts (about people's wellbeing). Often his arguments point out that problems with this scientific definition of morality seem to be problems shared by all science, or reason and words in general. Harris also spends some time describing how science might engage nuances and challenges of identifying the best ways for individuals, and groups of individuals, to improve their lives. Many of these issues are covered below.

===Philosophical case===
[[File:Researchers using Niskin bottle to collect water sample · DN-SD-01-00282.JPEG|thumb|right|Harris says science requires that one acknowledge certain values (e.g. curiosity)]]Although Harris's book discusses the challenges that a [[science of morality]] must face, he also mentions that his scientific argument is indeed [[Philosophy of science|philosophical]]. Furthermore, he says that this is the case for almost all scientific investigation. He mentions that modern science amounts to careful practice of accepted [[first principles|first philosophical principles]] like [[empiricism]] and [[physicalism]].&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 180"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that science has already very much settled on ''values'' in answering the question "what should I believe, and why should I believe it?".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Harris says it should not be surprising that normative ethical sciences are, or would be, similarly founded on bedrock assumptions ([[Basic norm]]s). Harris says:

{{quote|...science is often a matter of philosophy in practice. It is probably worth recalling that the original name for the physical sciences was, in fact, 'natural philosophy'... One could call [my proposal in ''The Moral Landscape''] a 'philosophical' position, but it is one that directly relates to the boundaries of science.&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 180"/&gt;}}

The way he thinks science might engage moral issues draws on various philosophical positions like [[ethical realism]] (there are facts worth calling 'moral facts'), and [[ethical naturalism]] (these facts relate to the physical world). Harris says a [[science of morality]] may resemble [[Utilitarianism]], but that the science is, importantly, more open-ended because it involves an evolving definition of well-being. Rather than committing to [[Reductive materialism]], then, Harris recognizes the arguments of [[Revisionary materialism|revisionists]] that psychological definitions themselves are contingent on research and discoveries. Harris adds that any science of morality must consider everything from emotions and thoughts to the actual actions and their consequences.&lt;ref name=EdgeHarris&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/morality10/morality10_index.html |title=The New Science Of Morality |publisher=Edge |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Harris, moral propositions, and explicit values in general, are concerned with the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society.&lt;ref name=tedharris&gt;{{cite web|author=TED2010 |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html |title=Sam Harris: Science can answer moral questions &amp;#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that "Social morality exists to sustain cooperative social relationships, and morality can be objectively evaluated by that standard."&lt;ref name=HarrisCFI1&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/video_of_sam_harris_talking_the_moral_landscape_in_nyc/ |title=Sam Harris Talks "The Moral Landscape" in NYC |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris sees some philosophers' talk of strictly ''private'' morality as akin to unproductive discussion of some private, personal physics. "If philosophers want to only talk about some bizarrely unnatural private morality, they are just changing the subject..."&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris also discusses how [[veil of ignorance|interchangeability of perspective]] might emerge as an important part of moral reasoning. He alludes to an 'unpleasant surprise principle', where someone realizes they have been supporting an ineffective moral norm (e.g. reported cases of Jew-hunting Nazis discovering that they themselves were of Jewish descent).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and moral truths===
Harris identifies three projects for science as it relates to morality: (1) explaining why humans do what they do in the name of "morality" (e.g. traditional [[evolutionary psychology]]), (2) determining which patterns of thought and behaviour humans actually ''should'' follow (i.e. the [[science of morality]]), and (3) generally persuading humans to change their ways.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Harris says that the first project is focused only on describing what is, whereas projects (2) and (3) are focused on what should and could be, respectively. Harris's point is that this second, prescriptive project should be the focus of a [[science of morality]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions, however, that we should not fear an "Orwellian future" with scientists at every door - vital progress in the science of morality could be shared in much the same way as advances in medicine.&lt;ref name=SalonHarris&gt;{{cite web|last=Don |first=Katherine |url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2010/10/17/sam_harris_interview/ |title="The Moral Landscape": Why science should shape morality |publisher=Salon.com |date=2010-10-17 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris says it is important to delineate project (1) from project (2), or else we risk committing a [[moralistic fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; He also highlights the importance of distinguishing between project (2) (asking what is right) from project (3) (trying to change behaviour). He says we must realize that the nuances of human motivation is a challenge in itself; humans often fail to do what they "ought" to do even to be successfully selfish - there is every reason to believe that discovering what is best for society would not change every member's habits overnight.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris does not imagine that people, even scientists, have always made the right moral decisions—indeed it is precisely his argument that many of them are wrong about moral facts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 42-44&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the many real challenges of good science in general, including human cognitive limitations and biases (e.g. [[loss aversion]] can sway human decisions on important issues like medicine). He mentions [[psychic numbing#Paul Slovic|the research of Paul Slovic]] and others to describe just a few of these established mental [[heuristics]] that might keep us from reasoning properly.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Although he mentions that training might temper the influence of these biases, Harris worries about research showing that incompetence and ignorance in a domain leads to confidence (the [[Dunning–Kruger effect]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris explains that debates and disagreement are a part of the [[scientific method]], and that one side can certainly be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt; He also explains that all the debates still available to science illustrate how much work could still be done, and how much conversation must continue.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harris's positive beliefs===
The book is full of issues that Harris thinks are far from being empirically, morally grey areas. That is, besides saying that 'reasonable' thinking about moral issues amounts to scientific thinking. For instance, he references one poll that found that 36 percent of British Muslims think apostates should be put to death for their unbelief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-432075/Multiculturalism-drives-young-Muslims-shun-British-values.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Multiculturalism 'drives young Muslims to shun British values' | date=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he says that these individuals are "morally confused".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests it is obvious that loneliness, helplessness, and poverty are "bad", but that these are by no means as far as [[positive psychology]] has taken, and will take us.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

In one section, called ''The illusion of free will'', Harris argues that there is a wealth of evidence in [[psychology]] (e.g. the [[illusion of introspection]]) or specifically related to the [[neuroscience of free will]] that suggests that metaphysically free will does not exist. This, he thinks, is intuitive; "trains of thought...convey the apparent reality of choices, freely made. But from a deeper perspective...thoughts simply arise (what else could they do?)".&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 105"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; He adds "The illusion of free will is itself an illusion".&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of free will's non-existence may be a working determinism, and Harris warns us not to confuse this with [[fatalism]].&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 105"/&gt;

One implication of a determined will, Harris says, is that it becomes unreasonable to punish people out of retribution—only behaviour modification and the deterrence of others still seem to be potentially valid reasons to punish.&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 109"&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt; This, especially because behaviour modification is a sort of cure for the evil behaviours; Harris provides a thought experiment: {{quote|Consider what would happen if we discovered a cure for human evil. Imagine, for the sake of argument...the cure for psychopathy can be put directly into the food supply like vitamin D...consider, for instance, the prospect of withholding the cure for evil from a murderer as part of his punishment. Would this make any moral sense at all?&lt;ref name="The Moral Landscape, pg. 109"/&gt;}}

Harris acknowledges a hierarchy of moral consideration (e.g. humans are more important than bacteria or mice). He says it follows that there could, in principle, be a species compared to which we are relatively unimportant (although he doubts such a species exists).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris supports the development of lie-detection technology and believes it would be, on the whole, beneficial for humanity. He also supports the formation of an explicit global civilization because of the potential for stability under a [[world government]].&lt;ref name="SalonHarris"/&gt;

====Religion: good or bad?====
Consistent with Harris's definition of morality, he says we must ask whether religion increases human flourishing today (regardless of whether it increased it in the distant past).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that religions may largely be practiced because they fit well with human cognitive tendencies (e.g. [[animism]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;
In Harris's view, religion and religious dogma is an impediment to reason, and he discusses the views of [[Francis Collins]] as one example.

Harris criticizes the tactics of secularists like [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]], who argue that science is not fundamentally (and certainly not superficially) in conflict with religion. Harris sees this as a very serious disagreement, that patronizingly attempts to pacify more devout theists.&lt;ref&gt;''The Moral Landscape'', pg. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Harris claims that societies can move away from deep dependence on religion just as it has from witchcraft, which he says was once just as deeply ingrained.&lt;ref name="SalonHarris"/&gt;

In advance of publication, four personal and professional acquaintances of the author,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,[http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/god-and-science-dont-mix1/L. Krauss, "God and Science Don't Mix"], ''The Wall Street Journal''(describing Harris and Dawkins as his "friends") (accessed on Harris's personal website, Nov. 7, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; biologist and science popularizer [[Richard Dawkins]], novelist [[Ian McEwan]], psycholinguist [[Steven Pinker]], and theoretical physicist [[Lawrence Krauss]], offered their praise for the book. They each serve on the Advisory Board of Harris's [[Project Reason]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-reason.org/about/advisory_board/ |title=Project Reason Advisory Board |publisher=Project-reason.org |date=1989-02-14 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their praise appears as [[blurb]]s (released by the book's publisher on Harris's website and reproduced on the book's [[dust jacket]]).&lt;ref name="blurb"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tweet &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/the-moral-landscape/ |title=www.samharris.org |publisher=www.samharris.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dawkins said,
{{quote|I was one of those who had unthinkingly bought into the hectoring myth that science can say nothing about morals. To my surprise, The Moral Landscape has changed all that for me. It should change it for philosophers too. Philosophers of mind have already discovered that they can't duck the study of neuroscience, and the best of them have raised their game as a result...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values |url=https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Landscape-Science-Determine-Values/dp/1439171211 |title=The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values (9781439171219): Sam Harris: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McEwan wrote that "Harris breathes intellectual fire into an ancient debate. Reading this thrilling, audacious book, you feel the ground shifting beneath your feet. Reason has never had a more passionate advocate."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt; Pinker said that Harris offers "a tremendously appealing vision, and one that no thinking person can afford to ignore."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt; Krauss opined that Harris "has the rare ability to frame arguments that are not only stimulating, they are downright nourishing, even if you don't always agree with him!"&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt;  Krauss predicted that "readers are bound to come away with previously firm convictions about the world challenged, and a vital new awareness about the nature and value of science and reason in our lives."&lt;ref name="blurb"/&gt;

==Reception==
''The Moral Landscape'' reached 9th in the ''[[New York Times]]'' Best Seller list for Hardcover Non-Fiction in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-10-24/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jennifer | last=Schuessler | title=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
[[Eastern Connecticut State University|ECSU]] Associate Professor of Philosophy James W. Diller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Gate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Diller/publications|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Andrew E. Nuzzolilli wrote a generally favorable review in a journal of the [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]]:

{{quote|The Moral Landscape represents an important contribution to a scientific discussion of morality. It explicates the determinants of moral behavior for a popular audience, placing causality in the external environment and in the organism's correlated neurological states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Science of Values: The Moral Landscape by Sam Harris" - US National Library of Medicine  National Institutes of Health|pmc=3501430}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his review for [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[California State University|Cal State]] Associate Professor of Philosophy Troy Jollimore wrote that the book "has some good, reasonable, and at times persuasive things to say" to people who are unfamiliar with [[moral skepticism]], but "has little to say to those people who actually do know what the arguments are, and it will not help others become much better informed." Jollimore also worried that Harris wrongly presents complex issues as having simple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/The-Moral-Landscape/ba-p/3477T. Jollimore, ''Barnes &amp; Noble Review''], Oct. 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' "when [Harris] stays closest to neuroscience, he says much that is interesting and important...".&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/books/review/Appiah-t.html K.A. Appiah, "Science Knows Best"], ''The New York Times'', Oct. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He later criticized Harris for failing to articulate "his central claim" and to identify how science has "revealed" that human well-being has an objective component.&lt;ref name= Times/&gt;  Appiah argued that Harris "ends up endorsing ... something very like [[utilitarianism]], a philosophical position that is now more than two centuries old, ... that faces a battery of familiar problems," which Harris merely "push[es] ... aside."&lt;ref name= Times/&gt; Harris responded to Appiah in the afterword of the paperback version, writing that  all of Appiah's criticisms had already been addressed in the chapter "Good and Evil".

Cognitive scientist and anthropologist [[Scott Atran]] criticized Harris for failing to engage with the philosophical literature on ethics and the problems in attempting to scientifically quantify human well being, noting that
{{quote|Nobel Prize–winner Daniel Kahneman studies what gives Americans pleasure—watching TV, talking to friends, having sex—and what makes them unhappy—commuting, working, looking after their children.

Critiquing the book, [[Kenan Malik]] wrote:

{{quote|Imagine a sociologist who wrote about evolutionary theory without discussing the work of Darwin, Fisher, Mayr, Hamilton, Trivers or Dawkins on the grounds that he did not come to his conclusions by reading about biology and because discussing concepts such as "adaptation", "speciation", "homology", "phylogenetics" or "kin selection" would "increase the amount of boredom in the universe". How seriously would we, and should we, take his argument?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malik|first=Kenan|title=Test tube truths|accessdate=12 November 2011|newspaper=New Humanist|page=26|date=May–June 2011|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/2538/test-tube-truths}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

American novelist [[Marilynne Robinson]], writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', asserted that Harris fails to "articulate a positive morality of his own" but, had he done so, would have found himself in the company of the "[[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], busily cooperating on schemes to enhance the world's well being, as they have been doing for generations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703882404575520062380030080 M. Robinson, "What Unitarians Know (and Sam Harris Doesn't)"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', Oct. 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

David Sexton of the London Evening Standard described Harris's claim to provide a science of morality as“the most extraordinarily overweening claim and evidently flawed. Science does not generate its own moral values; it can be used for good or ill and has been. Harris cannot stand outside culture, and the 'better future' he prophesies is itself a cultural projection. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The King James Bible bashers|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23938503-the-king-james-bible-bashers.do|accessdate=13 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430172150/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23938503-the-king-james-bible-bashers.do|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]], journalist for the ''[[Scientific American]]'' blog and author of ''The End of Science'', wrote "Harris further shows his arrogance when he claims that neuroscience, his own field, is best positioned to help us achieve a universal morality. ... Neuroscience can't even tell me how I can know the big, black, hairy thing on my couch is my dog Merlin. And we're going to trust neuroscience to tell us how we should resolve debates over the morality of abortion, euthanasia and armed intervention in other nations' affairs?"&lt;ref name="Horgan"&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2010/10/11/be-wary-of-the-righteous-rationalist-we-should-reject-sam-harriss-claim-that-science-can-be-a-moral-guidepost/ J. Horgan, "Be wary of the righteous rationalist: We should reject Sam Harris's claim that science can be a moral guidepost"], ''Scientific American'' blog, Oct. 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell Blackford]] said "The Moral Landscape is an ambitious work that will gladden the hearts, and strengthen the spines, of many secular thinkers" but that he had "serious reservations about a good book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm |title=Book review: Sam Harris’ The Moral Landscape |publisher=Jetpress.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]], reviewing the book, described Harris as "a knockabout atheist" who "joins the prodigious ranks of those whose claim to have transcended philosophy is just an instance of their doing it very badly", pointing out that "if [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]]'s hedonist is in one brain state and [[Aristotle]]'s active subject is in another, as no doubt they would be, it is a moral, not an empirical, problem to say which is to be preferred."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2011/03/blackburn-ethics-without-god-secularism-religion-sam-harris/ Morality without God] [[Prospect magazine]] 23-Mar-2011&lt;/ref&gt;  And [[H. Allen Orr]] in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' finds that "Despite Harris's bravado about 'how science can determine human values,' The Moral Landscape delivers nothing of the kind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/may/12/science-right-and-wrong/?page=2 The Science of Right and Wrong] by [[H.

Steve Isaacson wrote ''Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values''. Isaacson concludes, "The largest objection to Harris' argument is still Moore's [[open-question argument]]. Harris dismisses the argument as a word game easily avoided, but he never explains the game nor how to avoid it. He just ignores it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values |url=https://www.amazon.com/Mining-Moral-Landscape-Science-Determine/dp/1480292680 |title=Mining The Moral Landscape: Why Science Does Not (and cannot) Determine Human Values (978-1480292680): Steve Isaacson: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-20}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Moving Naturalism Forward workshop, [[Nobel Prize]] winning physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] described how in his youth he had been a utilitarian but had been dissuaded of the notion that "the fundamental principle that guides our actions should be the greatest happiness for the greatest number" by reading [[Aldous Hŭley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Weinberg went on to say: "Now, Sam Harris is aware of this kind of counter argument [to utilitarianism], and says it's not happiness, it's human welfare. Well, as you make things vaguer and vaguer, of course, it becomes harder and harder to say it doesn't fit your own moral feelings, but it also becomes less and less useful as a means of making moral judgements. You could take that to the extreme and make up some nonsense word and say that's the important thing and no-one could refute it but it wouldn't be very helpful. I regard human welfare and the way Sam Harris refers to it as sort of halfway in that direction to absolute nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebuve4INdAU&amp;list=PLrxfgDEc2NxYQuZ5T6CSdS8uafdh0kmDL&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after the book's release, Sam Harris wrote a follow-up at ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' responding to his critics.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/a-response-to-critics_b_815742.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Sam | last=Harris | title=A Response to Critics | date=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Moral Landscape Challenge''===

On August 31, 2013, in response to the negative reviews of his book, Harris issued a public challenge for anyone to write an essay of less than 1,000 words rebutting the "central argument" of the book.&lt;ref name="MLChallenge"&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-moral-landscape-challenge1/ The Moral Landscape Challenge : : Sam Harris]&lt;/ref&gt; The submissions were vetted by Russell Blackford, with the author of the essay judged best to receive $2,000, or $20,000 if they succeeded in changing Harris's mind.&lt;ref name="MLChallenge"/&gt; 424 essays were received by the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Metamagician/status/433134620637274113 "Twitter Russell Blackford"]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2014, Blackford announced the winning essay was written by philosophy instructor Ryan Born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-moral-landscape-challenge ''The Moral Landscape Challenge: The Winning Essay'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Road to Serfdom''''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Der Weg zur Knechtschaft'') is a book written between 1940 and 1943 by Austrian British [[economist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Hayek]], in which the author "[warns] of the danger of [[tyranny]] that inevitably results from government control of economic [[decision-making]] through [[planned economy|central planning]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebeling|first=Richard M.|title=Friedrich A. Hayek: A Centenary Appreciation|journal=The Freeman|date=May 1999|volume=49|issue=5|url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/friedrich-a-hayek-a-centenary-appreciation/#|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415224932/http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/friedrich-a-hayek-a-centenary-appreciation/|archivedate=2013-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further argues that the abandonment of [[individualism]] and [[classical liberalism]] inevitably leads to a loss of [[liberty|freedom]], the creation of an oppressive society, the tyranny of a [[dictator]], and the [[serfdom]] of the individual. Hayek challenged the general view among British academics that [[fascism]] (including [[National Socialism]]) was a [[capitalist]] reaction against [[socialism]]. He argued that fascism, National Socialism and socialism had common roots in central economic planning and empowering the state over the individual.

Since its publication in 1944, ''The Road to Serfdom'' has been an influential and popular exposition of market [[libertarianism]]. It has sold over two million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''The Road to Serfdom'' was to be the popular edition of the second volume of Hayek's treatise entitled "The Abuse and Decline of Reason",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ebenstein|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp8Uq8ve3EsC&amp;pg=PA107 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title was inspired by the writings of the 19th century French classical liberal thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] on the "road to servitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Friedrich Hayek: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp8Uq8ve3EsC&amp;pg=PA116 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2003|isbn=9780226181509 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was first published in Britain by [[Routledge]] in March 1944, during [[World War II]], and was quite popular, leading Hayek to call it "that unobtainable book", also due in part to wartime paper rationing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ebenstein|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp8Uq8ve3EsC&amp;pg=PA128 128]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in the United States by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in September 1944 and achieved great popularity. At the arrangement of editor [[Max Eastman]], the American magazine ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' published an abridged version in April 1945, enabling ''The Road to Serfdom'' to reach a wider popular audience beyond academics.

''The Road to Serfdom'' has had a significant impact on twentieth-century conservative and libertarian economic and political discourse, and is often cited today by commentators.

==Writing==
Hayek initially wrote a memo to the director of the [[London School of Economics]], [[William Beveridge]] in early 1930s to dispute then-popular claim that [[fascism]] represented the dying gasp of a failed capitalist system. Then, the memo grew into a magazine article. During [[World War II]], despite his intention to incorporate parts of that article into a much larger book, Hayek decided to bring it out separately after which he sent the manuscript to three American publishing houses, all of which rejected it&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|Caldwell|2007|pp=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Publication==
The book was originally published for a British audience by Routledge Press in March 1944 in the United Kingdom and then by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in September 1944. The U.S. publisher’s expectation was that the book would sell between 900 and 3,000 copies. The initial printing run of 2,000 copies was quickly sold out, and 30,000 copies were sold within six months. {{As of|2007|alt=In 2007}}, the University of Chicago Press estimated that more than 350,000 copies had been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|Caldwell|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qg61T_I1mwsC&amp;pg=PA1 1]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 20-page version of the book was then published in the April 1945 issue of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|76656715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a press run of several million copies. A 95-page abridged version was also published in 1945 and 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|802584460|13355651}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1945, a picture-book version was published in [[Look (American magazine)|''Look'' magazine]], later made into a [[pamphlet]] and distributed by [[General Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorersfoundation.org/glyphery/62.html|title=The Road to Serfdom, by F. A. Hayek – why the continual expansion of the state endangers liberty|website=explorersfoundation.org|isbn=978-1500345600|date= July 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been translated into approximately 20 languages and is dedicated "To the [[socialism|socialists]] of all [[Political Party|parties]]". The introduction to the 50th anniversary edition is written by [[Milton Friedman]] (another recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] 1976).

In 2007, the [[University of Chicago Press]] issued a "Definitive Edition", Volume 2 in the "Collected Works of F. A. Hayek" series. In June 2010, the book achieved new popularity by rising to the top of the [[Amazon.com]] bestseller list following extended coverage of the book on ''[[The Glenn Beck Program]]''. Since that date, it has sold another 250,000 copies in its print and digital editions.

==Summary==
Hayek argues that Western democracies, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have "progressively abandoned that freedom in economic affairs without which personal and political freedom has never existed in the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Society has mistakenly tried to ensure continuing prosperity by centralized planning, which inevitably leads to totalitarianism. "We have in effect undertaken to dispense with the forces which produced unforeseen results and to replace the impersonal and anonymous mechanism of the market by collective and ‘conscious’ direction of all social forces to deliberately chosen goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialism, while presented as a means of assuring equality, does so through "restraint and servitude", while "democracy seeks equality in liberty".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planning, because it is coercive, is an inferior method of regulation, while the competition of a free market is superior "because it is the only method by which our activities can be adjusted to each other without coercive or arbitrary intervention of authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Centralized planning is inherently undemocratic in Hayek's view, because it requires "that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of these minorities to act by taking money or property in pursuit of centralized goals, destroys the Rule of Law and individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|pp=80–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is centralized planning, "the individual would more than ever become a mere means, to be used by the authority in the service of such abstractions as the 'social welfare' or the 'good of the community'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the very poor have more personal freedom in an open society than a centrally planned one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[W]hile the last resort of a competitive economy is the [[bailiff]], the ultimate sanction of a planned economy is the hangman."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialism is a hypocritical system, because its professed humanitarian goals can only be put into practice by brutal methods "of which most socialists disapprove".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such centralized systems also require effective propaganda, so that the people come to believe that the state's goals are theirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek argues that the roots of National Socialism lie in socialism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|pp=1183–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then draws parallels to the thought of British leaders:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The increasing veneration for the state, the admiration of power, and of bigness for bigness' sake, the enthusiasm for "organization" of everything (we now call it "planning") and that "inability to leave anything to the simple power of organic growth"&amp;nbsp;... are all scarcely less marked in England now than they were in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hayek believed that after World War II, "wisdom in the management of our economic affairs will be even more important than before and that the fate of our civilization will ultimately depend on how we solve the economic problems we shall then face".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only chance to build a decent world is "to improve the general level of wealth" via the activities of free markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw international organization as involving a further threat to individual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|pp=240–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded: "The guiding principle that a policy of freedom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy remains as true today as it was in the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of government===
Although Hayek believed that government intervention in markets would lead to a loss of freedom, he recognized a limited role for government to perform tasks of which free markets were not capable:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The successful use of competition as the principle of social organization precludes certain types of coercive interference with economic life, but it admits of others which sometimes may very considerably assist its work and even requires certain kinds of government action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
While Hayek is opposed to regulations that restrict the freedom to enter a trade, or to buy and sell at any price, or to control quantities, he acknowledges the utility of regulations that restrict legal methods of production, so long as these are applied equally to everyone and not used as an indirect way of controlling prices or quantities, and without forgetting the cost of such restrictions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To prohibit the use of certain poisonous substances, or to require special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation of competition. The only question here is whether in the particular instance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs they impose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He notes that there are certain areas, such as the environment, where activities that cause damage to third parties (known to economists as "negative [[externalities]]") cannot effectively be regulated solely by the marketplace:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nor can certain harmful effects of deforestation, of some methods of farming, or of the smoke and noise of factories, be confined to the owner of the property in question, or to those willing to submit to the damage for an agreed compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The government also has a role in preventing fraud:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the most essential prerequisite of its [the market's] proper functioning, the prevention of fraud and deception (including exploitation of ignorance), provides a great and by no means fully accomplished object of legislative activity.&lt;ref name="HayekThe"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|1994|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The government also has a role in creating a safety net:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/hayek_on_social_insurance.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Hayek on Social Insurance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/opinion/krugman-free-to-die.html Free to Die] By PAUL KRUGMAN, New York Times, September 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He concludes: "In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing."&lt;ref name="HayekThe" /&gt;

==Cautions and clarifications==
While Hayek is clear when read in the full, several of his word choices have not aged or traveled well, leading to possible confusion in 21st century America. Hayek offered later clarifications:
* socialism meant state control of the economy as in Hitler's [[Nazi Germany]] (not a welfare state)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|Caldwell|2007|pp=54-55}} From the preface to the 1976 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;
* classical liberal ideals meant liberty, freedom and rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hayek|Caldwell|2007|p=45}} From the foreword to the 1956 American paperback edition.&lt;/ref&gt; (not the views of a modern liberal progressive political parties){{cn|date=April 2018}}

Some of Hayek's arguments are timeless (thus continued publication), but his sources and examples are from early to mid 20th century Europe. A thorough knowledge of those times is necessary to fully appreciate the book. Hayek's world included the [[Great Depression]], the rise of autocracies in [[Nazi Germany|Russia]], [[National Fascist Party#Fascist government|Italy]] and Germany and World War II (during which Hayek was writing). The 2007 edition includes numerous notes connecting the text to history.

==Reception==
[[John Maynard Keynes]] said of it: "In my opinion it is a grand book&amp;nbsp;... Morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it: and not only in agreement with it, but in deeply moved agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Thomas W. Hazlett|issue=July 1992|url=http://reason.com/hayekint.shtml|title=The Road from Serfdom – Forseeing the Fall F.A. Hayek interviewed by Thomas W. Hazlett |publisher=Reason magazine|date=2002|accessdate=2012-06-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050203031837/http://reason.com/hayekint.shtml|archivedate=2005-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Keynes did not think Hayek's philosophy was of ''practical'' use; this was explained later in the same letter, commenting: "What we need therefore, in my opinion, is not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion with the results of your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of them. Your greatest danger ahead is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth R. Hoover|title=Economics as Ideology|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers|date=2003|page=152|ISBN=0-7425-3113-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRPbeVirpysC&amp;pg=PA152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] responded with both praise and criticism, stating, "in the negative part of Professor Hayek's thesis there is a great deal of truth. It cannot be said too often – at any rate, it is not being said nearly often enough – that collectivism is not inherently democratic, but, on the contrary, gives to a tyrannical minority such powers as the Spanish Inquisitors never dreamt of." Yet he also warned, "[A] return to 'free' competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse, because more irresponsible, than that of the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of the Road to Serfdom by F. A. Hayek, etc|journal=As I Please, 1943–1945: The Collected Essays, Journalism &amp; Letters|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayek's work was influential enough to warrant mention during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 British general election]], when according to [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Winston Churchill]] was "fortified in his apprehensions [of a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government] by reading Professor Hayek's ''The Road to Serfdom''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold Macmillan|title=Tides of Fortune, 1945–1955|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|date=1969|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IABIAAAAMAAJ|asin=B0014BRAYS}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he warned in an election broadcast in 1945 that a socialist system would "have to fall back on some form of [[Gestapo]]". The Labour leader [[Clement Attlee]] responded in his election broadcast by claiming that what Churchill had said was the "second-hand version of the academic views of an Austrian professor, Friedrich August von Hayek".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertystory.net/LSTHINKHAYEKLIFE.htm|title=Hayek, life and times|publisher=libertystory.net|accessdate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservative Central Office]] sacrificed 1.5 tons of their precious paper ration allocated for the 1945 election so that more copies of ''The Road to Serfdom'' could be printed, although to no avail, as Labour won a landslide victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[David Willetts]]|author2=Richard Forsdyke|title=After the Landslide: Learning the Lessons of 1906 and 1945|publisher=Centre for Policy Studies|date=1999|page=59|url=https://www.cps.org.uk/files/reports/original/111221165304-Afterthelandslidesep1999DavidWilletts.pdf|type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Road to Serfdom'' appears on [[Martin Seymour-Smith]]'s list of the ''[[100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]]'', whilst it made ''#1'' on Human Events: Top Ten Books Every Republican Congressman Should Read&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanevents.com/2006/11/21/top-10-books-every-republican-congressman-should-read/|title=Top 10 Books Every Republican Congressman Should Read|publisher=Townhall Media|work=Human Events|date=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006.

Milton Friedman's assessment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think the Adam Smith role was played in this cycle [i.e. the late twentieth century collapse of socialism in which the idea of free-markets succeeded first, and then special events catalyzed a complete change of socio-political policy in countries around the world] by Friedrich Hayek’s ''The Road to Serfdom''.&lt;ref name=hayekcenterpage5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hayekcenter.org/?page_id=5 |title=Quotes on Hayek |website=hayekcenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Milton Friedman also described ''The Road to Serfdom'' as "one of the great books of our time."

[[Alan Brinkley]]'s assessment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The publication of two books&amp;nbsp;... helped to galvanize the concerns that were beginning to emerge among intellectuals (and many others) about the implications of totalitarianism. One was James Burnham’s The Managerial Revolution&amp;nbsp;... [A second] Friedrich A. Hayek’s ''The Road to Serfdom''&amp;nbsp;... was far more controversial – and influential. Even more than Burnham, Hayek forced into public discourse the question of the compatibility of democracy and statism&amp;nbsp;... In responding to Burnham and Hayek&amp;nbsp;... liberals [in the statist sense of this term as used by some in the United States] were in fact responding to a powerful strain of Jeffersonian anti-statism in American political culture&amp;nbsp;... The result was a subtle but important shift in liberal [i.e. American statist] thinking.&lt;ref name=hayekcenterpage5 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Economic sociologist [[Karl Polanyi]] made a case diametrically opposed to Hayek, arguing that unfettered markets had undermined the social order and that economic breakdown had paved the way for the emergence of dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karl Polanyi|author2=Joseph E.

[[Herman Finer]], a [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] socialist, published a rebuttal in his ''The Road to Reaction'' in 1946. Hayek called Finer's book "a specimen of abuse and invective which is probably unique in contemporary academic discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=George H.

Barnard|date=January 1946|pp=290–300|publisher=Southern Economic Association|doi=10.2307/1052278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after reading an early copy of ''The Road to Serfdom'', provided to her by Hayek. In the introduction to her book, Wootton mentioned ''The Road to Serfdom'' and claimed that "Much of what I have written is devoted to criticism of the views put forward by Professor Hayek in this and other books."{{Sfn|Wootton|1945|pp=5}} The central argument made in ''Freedom under Planning'' is that "there is nothing in the conscious planning of economic priorities which is inherently incompatible with the freedoms which mean most to the contemporary Englishman or American. Civil liberties are quite unaffected. We can, if we wish, deliberately plan so as to give the fullest possible scope for the pursuit by individuals and social groups of cultural ends which are in no way state-determined."{{Sfn|Wootton|1945|pp=158}} Wootton criticizes Hayek for claiming that planning ''must'' lead to oppression, when, in her view, that is merely one ''possibility'' among many. She argues that "there seems hardly better case for taking for granted that planning will bring the worst to the top than for the opposite assumption that the seats of office will be filled with angels".{{Sfn|Wootton|1945|pp=163}} Thus, Wootton acknowledges the possibility that planning may exist alongside tyranny, but claims that it is equally possible to combine planning with freedom. She concludes that "A happy and fruitful marriage between freedom and planning can, in short, be arranged."{{Sfn|Wootton|1945|pp=159}}

However, [[Frank Knight]], founder of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school of economics]], disputes the claim that ''Freedom under Planning'' contradicts ''The Road to Serfdom''. He wrote in a scholarly review of the Wootton book: "Let me repeat that the Wootton book is in no logical sense an answer to ''The Road to Serfdom'', whatever may be thought of the cogency of Hayek's argument, or the soundness of his position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Knight, Frank | year = 1946 | title = Freedom Under Planning | journal = Journal of Political Economy | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = 451–454 | doi = 10.1086/256402 | authorlink = Frank Knight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review (collected in ''The Present as History'', 1953) [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Paul Sweezy]] joked that Hayek would have you believe that if there was an over-production of baby carriages, the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] arguments of [[Stafford Beer]] in his 1973 CBC Massey Lectures, ''Designing Freedom'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-1973-cbc-massey-lectures-designing-freedom-1.2946819|title=The 1973 CBC Massey Lectures, "Designing Freedom"|website=cbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of [[Herbert A. Simon]] and [[Albert Ando]] on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.&lt;ref&gt;See (full references on [[Herbert A. Simon]] entry) Simon's papers in his collected ''Models of Bounded Rationality'', a qualitative discussion in his ''Sciences of the Artificial'', and a full presentation of the mathematical theory by P.J. Courtois in his ''Decomposability: queueing and computer system applications'' (Academic Press, 1977).
The papers in the section "The Structure of Causal Systems" of Vol. 3 of ''Models of Bounded Rationality'' (MIT Press, 1997) provide a summary and review of Simon's work in this area.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeffrey Sachs]] wrote that the social-welfare states, with high rates of taxation and social outlays, outperform the relatively free-market economies, according to the [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-social-welfare-state |title=The Social Welfare State, beyond Ideology|author=[[Jeffrey Sachs]]|journal=[[Scientific American]] |date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Easterly]] wrote a rebuttal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116355956112023480 |title=Dismal Science''|author=[[William Easterly]]|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sachs wrote a counter-rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/sachs-on-hayek-and-easterly.html|title=Why Hayek Was Wrong: Sachs Responds to Easterly|author=Greg Mankiw|work=Greg Mankiw's Blog – Random Observations for Students of Economics|date=November 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Zencey]] wrote that the free market economy Hayek advocated is designed for an infinite planet, and when it runs into physical limits (as any growing system must), the result is a need for centralized planning to mediate the problematic interface of economy and nature. "Planning is planning, whether it's done to minimize poverty and injustice, as socialists were advocating then, or to preserve the minimum flow of ecosystem services that civilization requires, as we are finding increasingly necessary today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/4/22/858654/-The-Other-Road-to-Serfdom-|title=The Other Road to Serfdom|publisher=[[The Daily Kos]]|date=April 20, 2010|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Hayek portrait.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Friedrich Hayek]]]]

Mises Institute [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]/[[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] economist [[Walter Block]] has observed critically that while ''The Road to Serfdom'' makes a strong case against centrally planned economies, it appears only lukewarm in its support of a [[free market]] system and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], with Hayek even going so far as to say that "probably nothing has done so much harm to the liberal cause as the wooden insistence of some liberals on certain rules of thumb, above all the principle of laissez-faire capitalism". In the book, Hayek writes that the government has a role to play in the economy through the monetary system (a view that he later withdrew),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich August von Hayek|title=The Denationalization of Money – The Argument Refined – An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies|url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Denationalisation%20of%20Money%20The%20Argument%20Refined_5.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document|isbn=9781610165204|publisher=The Institute Of Economic Affairs|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; work-hours regulation, social welfare, and institutions for the flow of proper information. Through analysis of this and many other of Hayek's works, Block asserts that: "in making the case against socialism, Hayek was led into making all sort of compromises with what otherwise appeared to be his own philosophical perspective – so much so, that if a system was erected on the basis of them, it would not differ too sharply from what this author explicitly opposed".&lt;ref name=blockserfdom&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Block | first = Walter | authorlink = Walter Block | title = Hayek's Road to Serfdom | journal = [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 339–365 | publisher = [[Center for Libertarian Studies]] | year = 1996 | url = https://mises.org/journals/jls/12_2/12_2_6.pdf | accessdate = 2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Tullock]] has argued Hayek's analysis predicted totalitarian governments in much of Europe in the late 20th century. He uses Sweden, in which the government at that time controlled 63 percent of [[GNP]], as an example to support his argument that the basic problem with ''The Road to Serfdom'' is "that it offered predictions which turned out to be false. The steady advance of government in places such as Sweden has not led to any loss of non-economic freedoms." While criticizing Hayek, Tullock still praises the classical liberal notion of economic freedom, saying, "Arguments for political freedom are strong, as are the arguments for economic freedom. We needn’t make one set of arguments depend on the other."&lt;ref name=Tullock&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Walker

Skidelsky argues that Hayek's argument was contingent, and that, "By the 1970s there was some evidence of the slippery slope&amp;nbsp;... and then there was [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]]. Hayek's warning played a critical part in her determination to 'roll back the state.'"&lt;ref name=Skidelsky&gt;{{Cite book|last = Skidelsky|first=Robert|author-link = Robert Skidelsky|editor-last=Feser|editor-first=Edward|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hayek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-R9tSD1cK0C|pages=82–110|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9781139827584|postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Matthias Theodor Mommsen''' (30 November 1817 &amp;ndash; 1 November 1903) was a German [[classics|classical scholar]], [[historian]], [[jurist]], [[journalist]], [[politician]] and [[archaeologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/618/000107297/|title=Theodor Mommsen|author=|date=|website=www.nndb.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the greatest [[classicists]] of the 19th century. His work regarding [[Roman history]] is still of fundamental importance for contemporary research. He received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1902 for being "the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work, ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|A History of Rome]]''", after having been nominated by 18 members of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1902/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1902|author=|date=|website=nobelprize.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=8100|title=Nomination Database|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a prominent German politician, as a member of the Prussian and German parliaments. His works on [[Roman law]] and on the [[law of obligations]] had a significant impact on the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German civil code]].

== Life ==
Mommsen was born to German parents in [[Garding]] in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] in 1817, then ruled by the king of Denmark, and grew up in [[Bad Oldesloe]] in [[Holstein]], where his father was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister. He studied mostly at home, though he attended the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] [[Christianeum Hamburg|Christianeum]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] for four years. He studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] and received his diploma in 1837. As he could not afford to study at [[Göttingen]], he enrolled at the [[University of Kiel]].

Mommsen studied [[jurisprudence]] at Kiel from 1838 to 1843, finishing his studies with the degree of Doctor of Roman Law. During this time he was the roommate of [[Theodor Storm]], who was later to become a renowned poet. Together with Mommsen's brother Tycho, the three friends even published a collection of poems (''Liederbuch dreier Freunde''). Thanks to a royal Danish grant, Mommsen was able to visit France and Italy to study preserved classical Roman inscriptions. During the [[revolution of 1848]] he worked as a war correspondent in then-Danish [[Rendsburg]], supporting the German [[Schleswig-Holstein#History|annexation of Schleswig-Holstein]] and a constitutional reform. Having been forced to leave the country by the Danes, he became a professor of [[law]] in the same year at the [[University of Leipzig]]. When Mommsen protested against the new constitution of [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] in 1851, he had to resign. However, the next year he obtained a professorship in Roman law at the [[University of Zurich]] and then spent a couple of years in exile. In 1854 he became a professor of law at the [[University of Breslau]] where he met [[Jakob Bernays]]. Mommsen became a research professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] in 1857. He later helped to create and manage the German Archaeological Institute in Rome.

In 1858 Mommsen was appointed a member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, and he also became professor of Roman History at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1861, where he held lectures up to 1887. Mommsen received high recognition for his academic achievements: foreign membership of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1859,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001937 |title=Th. Mommsen (1817 - 1903) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medal [[Pour le Mérite]] in 1868, honorary citizenship of Rome, elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1870,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistm|title=MemberListM|author=|date=|website=americanantiquarian.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nobel prize for literature]] in 1902 for his main work ''Römische Geschichte'' (''Roman History''). (He is one of the very few [[non-fiction]] writers to receive the Nobel prize in literature.)&lt;ref&gt;Until 2007, when [[Doris Lessing]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature Prize]], Mommsen was the oldest person to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Römischen Ge-schichte HgstRes.PNG|thumb|Not all of Mommsen's library was completely destroyed by the fire; His version in ''Roman History v4'' was damaged but preserved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/etc/dokumente/a130801.pdf |format=PDF |title=Archiv der BBAW, 47/1 fol. 6; Phönix aus der Asche |page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At 2 a.m. on 7 July 1880 a fire occurred in the upper floor workroom-library of Mommsen's house at Marchstraße 6 in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mgh-bibliothek.de/etc/dokumente/a130801.pdf |format=PDF |title= Phönix aus der Asche - Theodor Mommsen und die Monumenta Germaniae Historica |first1= Arno |last1=Mentzel-Reuters |first2=Mark |last2=Mersiowsky |first3=Peter |last3=Orth |first4=Olaf B. |last4=Rader |location= München and Berlin |year=2005 |page=53 |publisher=Mgh-bibliothek.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vossische Zeitung]] 12/7/1880 (Nr. 192) in column "Lokales"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/search/Marchstrasse+6,+Berlin,+germany/data=!4m2!2m1!4b1?hl=en&amp;dg=dbrw&amp;newdg=1|title=Google Maps|author=|date=|website=Google Maps|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being burned while attempting to remove valuable papers, he was restrained from returning to the blazing house. Several old [[manuscript]]s were burnt to ashes, including ''Manuscript 0.4.36'', which was on loan from the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;quote: Another manuscript is beyond recall; namely, 0.4.36, which was borrowed by Professor Theodor Mommsen and perished in the lamentable fire at his house in 1880.

Mommsen was an indefatigable worker who rose at five to do research in his library. People often saw him reading whilst walking in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;"Apart from any actual learning, the deepest impression that I carried away from my first ''Semester'' in Berlin was a sense of the pervading enthusiasm for ''Wissenschaft''. I was also astonished at the high standard of industry both among the Seniors and the Juniors whom I mixed up with. And I could not help feeling that our steadiest workers among my Oxford undergraduate friends were only casual 'half-timers' by comparison. What was still more stimulating was the whole-hearted and unquestioning reverence for learning broadcast through the academic circles and extending even to the outside public. I had a striking proof of this: as an illustration of national character, the anecdote is worth recording. Living in Berlin at some distance from the university, I used to go in every morning by the same early tram: and at last noting that I was a foreigner of regular habits, the affable and chatty tramway conductor used to point out to me the objects worthy of interest by the way (''Sehenswürdigkeiten''—a crisp Teutonic word). One morning as we approached a halting-place, I saw a little old gentleman with silvery hair leaning against a lamp-post and holding a large open volume near to his short-sighted eyes, oblivious of the uproar around: the conductor sprang down towards him, and tapping him reverentially on the shoulder conducted him gently to the tram and settled him in his place. Immediately the old gentleman buried himself again up to the eyes in his tome. The conductor, proud of this new ''Sehenswürdigkeit'', whispered to me in an awed voice: '' 'Da ist der berühmte Herr Professor Mommsen; er verliert kein Moment'!'' ('There is the famous Professor Mr Mommsen; he never loses a moment!' referring to his absorption in his book). I felt thrilled, not by Mommsen, but by this deep revelation of the national soul, an illiterate conductor knowing of Mommsen at all, knowing that he was academically famous, being proud of having him in his tram, and proud that he 'never lost a moment' for study." — Farnell, Lewis R. (1934). ''An Oxonian Looks Back.'' London: Martin Hopkinson, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mommsen had sixteen children with his wife Marie (daughter of the publisher and editor Karl Reimer of Leipzig). Their oldest daughter Maria married [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], the great Classics scholar. Their grandson [[Theodor Ernst Mommsen]] (1905-1958) became a professor of medieval history in the United States. Two of the great-grandsons, [[Hans Mommsen]] and [[Wolfgang Mommsen]], were prominent German historians.

Mommsen published over 1,500 works, and effectively established a new framework for the systematic study of [[Rome|Roman]] history. He pioneered [[epigraphy]], the study of [[inscription]]s in material artifacts. Although the unfinished ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', written early in his career, has long been widely considered as his main work, the work most relevant today is perhaps the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', a collection of Roman inscriptions he contributed to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |title=Theodor Mommsen |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824083420/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |archivedate=24 August 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[History of Rome (Mommsen)|Mommsen's ''History of Rome'']], his most famous work, appeared as three volumes in 1854, 1855, and 1856; it expounded Roman history up to the end of the [[Roman republic]] and the rule of [[Julius Caesar]]. Since Mommsen admired Caesar, he felt unable to describe the death of his hero. He closely compared the political thought and terminology of the ancient Republic, especially during its last century, with the situation of his own time, e.g., the [[nation-state]], [[democracy]] and incipient [[imperialism]]. It is one of the great classics of historical works. Mommsen never wrote a promised next volume to recount subsequent events during the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]], i.e., a volume 4, although demand was high for a continuation.&lt;ref&gt;Notes taken between 1882 and 1886 of his lectures on the Roman Empire were discovered nearly a century later and in 1992 were published under the title ''A History of Rome Under the Emperors''.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately very popular and acknowledged internationally by classical scholars, the work also quickly received criticism.&lt;ref&gt;His terse style was called journalistic. His transparent comparison of ancient to modern politics was said to distort. In 1931 [[Egon Friedell]] summed it up, that in his hands "[[Crassus]] becomes a [[speculator]] in the manner of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], the brothers [[Gracchus]] are [[Socialist]] leaders, and the [[Gallia|Gauls]] are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], etc." Friedell, Kulturgeschichte der Neuzeit, v3 p270. Cf., [[History of Rome (Mommsen)|Mommsen's ''History of Rome'']].&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire from Caesar to Diocletian'' (1885), published as volume 5 of his ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', is a description of all Roman regions during the early imperial period.
* ''Roman Chronology to the Time of Caesar'' (1858) written with his brother [[August Mommsen]].
* ''Roman Constitutional Law'' (1871–1888). This systematic treatment of [[Roman Law|Roman constitutional law]] in three volumes has been of importance for research on ancient history.

* ''Roman Criminal Law'' (1899)
* ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', lead editor and editor (1861, et seq.)
* ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (of [[Justinian I|Justinian]]), editor (1866–1870, two volumes)
* ''Iordanis Romana et Getica'' (1882) was Mommsen's critical edition of [[Jordanes]]' ''The Origin and Deeds of the Goths'' and has subsequently come to be generally known simply as ''[[Getica]]''.
* ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', editor (1905, posthumous)
* ''Monumentum Ancyranum''
* More than 1,500 further studies and treatises on single issues.

A bibliography of over 1,000 of his works is given by [[Karl Zangemeister|Zangemeister]] in ''Mommsen als Schriftsteller'' (1887; continued by Jacobs, 1905).

== Mommsen as editor and organiser ==
While he was secretary of the Historical-Philological Class at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] (1874–1895), Mommsen organised countless scientific projects, mostly editions of original sources.

=== ''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' ===
At the beginning of his career, when he published the inscriptions of the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] Kingdom (1852), Mommsen already had in mind a collection of all known ancient Latin inscriptions. He received additional impetus and training from [[Bartolomeo Borghesi]] of [[San Marino]]. The complete ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' would consist of sixteen volumes. Fifteen of them appeared in Mommsen's lifetime and he wrote five of them himself. The basic principle of the edition (contrary to previous collections) was the method of autopsy, according to which all copies (i.e., modern transcriptions) of inscriptions were to be checked and compared to the original.

=== Further editions and research projects ===
Mommsen published the fundamental collections in Roman law: the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]''. Furthermore, he played an important role in the publication of the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', the edition of the texts of the [[Church Fathers]], the [[Limes|Limes Romanus]] (Roman frontiers) research and countless other projects.

== Mommsen as politician ==
Mommsen was a delegate to the [[Prussian House of Representatives]] from 1863&amp;ndash;66 and again from 1873&amp;ndash;79, and delegate to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] from 1881–1884, at first for the liberal [[German Progress Party]] (''Deutsche Fortschrittspartei''), later for the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]], and finally for the [[Liberal Union (Germany)|Secessionists]]. He was very concerned with questions about academic and educational policies and held national positions. Although he had supported [[German Unification]], he was disappointed with the politics of the [[German Empire]] and he was quite pessimistic about its future. Mommsen strongly disagreed with [[Otto von Bismarck]] about social policies in 1881, advising collaboration between Liberals and Social Democrats and using such strong language that he narrowly avoided prosecution.

[[File:Theodor Mommsen outdoors.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mommsen late in his career]]

As a Liberal nationalist, Mommsen favored assimilation of ethnic minorities into German society, not exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Ziblatt|title=Structuring the State: The Formation of Italy and Germany and the Puzzle of Federalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dlob9r5TH0C&amp;pg=PA54|year=2008|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, his colleague [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] began a political campaign against Jews (the so-called ''Berliner Antisemitismusstreit''). Mommsen strongly opposed [[antisemitism]] and wrote a harsh pamphlet in which he denounced von Treitschke's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_14106.html|title=Mommsen, Theodor|last=Graetz|first=Michael J.|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen viewed a solution to antisemitism in voluntary [[cultural assimilation]], suggesting that the Jews could follow the example of the people of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Hannover|Hanover]] and other German states, which gave up some of their special customs when integrating in [[Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9906E1D61630EE3ABC4053DFB766838A699FDE "Prof. Mommsen and the Jews"], from ''[[The Times]]'', reprinted in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 January 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mommsen was a vehement spokesman for German nationalism, maintaining a militant attitude towards the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic nations]], to the point of advocating the use of violence against them. In an 1897 letter to the ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]'' of [[Vienna]], Mommsen called [[Czechs]] "apostles of barbarism" and wrote that "the Czech skull is impervious to reason, but it is susceptible to blows".&lt;ref&gt;http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817944915_146.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--What publication is this from?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&amp;aid=nfp&amp;datum=18971031&amp;seite=1&amp;zoom=2 |title=An die Deutschen in Oesterreich |publisher=Neue Freie Presse - issue 11923 |date=31 October 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of Mommsen ==

[[File:Theodor Mommsen by Franz von Lenbach 1897.jpg|thumb|Mommsen by Franz von Lenbach, 1897.]]

Fellow Nobel Laureate (1925) [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] cited Mommsen's interpretation of the last First Consul of the Republic, Julius Caesar, as one of the inspirations for his 1898 (1905 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]) play, ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]''.

Noted naval historian and theorist [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] formulated the thesis for his magnum opus, ''[[The Influence of Sea Power Upon History]]'', while reading Mommsen's ''History of Rome''.&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, Alfred Thayer. ''From Sail to Stream: Recollections of Naval Life''. New York: Harper and Brothers Publishers, 1907: 277&lt;/ref&gt;

The playwright [[Heiner Müller]] wrote a 'performance text' entitled ''Mommsens Block'' (1993), inspired by the publication of Mommsen's fragmentary notes on the later Roman empire and by the [[East German]] government's decision to replace a statue of [[Karl Marx]] outside the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] with one of Mommsen.&lt;ref&gt;Heiner Müller, ''[[Mommsen's Block]]''. In ''A Heiner Müller Reader: Plays | Poetry | Prose''. Ed. and trans. [[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]]. PAJ Books Ser. Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8018-6578-6}}. p.122-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (academic high school) named for Mommsen in his hometown of [[Bad Oldesloe]], Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. His birthplace [[Garding]] in the west of Schleswig styles itself "Mommsen-Stadt Garding".

===Mark Twain===

"One of the highpoints of [[Mark Twain]]'s European tour of 1892 was a large formal banquet at the [[University of Berlin]]... . Mark Twain was an honored guest, seated at the head table with some twenty 'particularly eminent professors'; and it was from this vantage point that he witnessed the following incident... ."&lt;ref&gt;Saunder and Collins, "Introduction" to their edition of Mommsen's ''History of Rome'' (Meridian Books 1958), at 1-17, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In Twain's own words:   
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;When apparently the last eminent guest had long ago taken his place, again those three bugle-blasts rang out, and once more the swords leaped from their scabbards. Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire. Still, indolent eyes were turned toward the distant entrance, and we saw the silken gleam and the lifted sword of a guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before. There was an excited whisper at our table—'MOMMSEN!'—and the whole house rose. Rose and shouted and stamped and clapped and banged the beer mugs. Just simply a storm!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then the little man with his long hair and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emersonian]] face edged his way past us and took his seat. I could have touched him with my hand—Mommsen!—think of it! ... I would have walked a great many miles to get a sight of him, and here he was, without trouble or tramp or cost of any kind. Here he was clothed in a titanic deceptive modesty which made him look like other men.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Saunders and Collins, ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Blavatsky.003.jpg|thumb|180px|&lt;center&gt;[[Helena Blavatsky]] ([[Theosophist]]).&lt;/center&gt;]]
Modern [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is classified by prominent representatives of [[Western philosophy]] as a "[[pantheistic]]{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=294}} [[Religious syncretism|philosophical-religious system]]."{{sfn|Britannica}}{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|p=302}}{{sfn|Крашкина|1999}}{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=11}} A Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Trefilov]] claimed that [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] doctrine was formed from the beginning as a synthesis of philosophical views and [[Religion|religious]] forms of the various ages and peoples with modern scientific ideas.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} An author of [[The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] Michael Wakoff stated that Blavatskian Theosophy was based on [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu philosophy]], and fragments of the [[Western esotericism]] with using an "absolutist [[metaphysics]]."{{sfn|Wakoff|2016}} In ''[[:ru:Новая философская энциклопедия|The New Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' it is said Blavatsky's Theosophy is an attempt to merge into a universal doctrine all religions by revealing their "common deep essence" and detection of "identity meanings of symbols," all philosophies (including [[esoteric]]), and all [[science]]s (including [[occult]]).{{sfn|Митюгова|2010}}{{refn|group=note|Professor James McClenon wrote that philosophy "used as one source of inspiration" by Blavatsky.{{sfn|McClenon|1998}} In professor Julia Shabanova's opinion, philosophy as the "sphere of spiritual culture" is the closest one to Theosophy.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=22}}}}

== Philosophers about Theosophy ==
=== One point of view ===
A French philosopher [[René Guénon]] wrote that "the theories of the [[Theosophical Society]] are so strangely similar to those of [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] that one may wonder whether they do not both derive from a common source."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|He referred here a magazine author Georges Pécoul.{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=29}} According to Julia Shabanova, the Theosophical [[epistemology]] is based on [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuitionism]] and principle of analogies.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=93}}}} He stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine is occupied the "idea of evolution." He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are
&lt;blockquote&gt;"seven '[[Root race|mother-races]]' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through seven globes in a '[[Round (Theosophy)|round]]', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is also the fourth of our 'planetary system'."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=55, 131|Guénon|2004|2p=98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Concerning of the "so-called highly secret Tibetan texts" used by Blavatsky in writing her books ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' and ''[[The Voice of the Silence]],'' Guénon stated that she has had a "translation of extracts from the [[Kangyur|Kandjur]] and [[Tengyur|Tandjur]]," published in 1836 by [[Alexander Csoma de Koros]].{{sfn|Guénon|2004|pp=85–6}}{{refn|group=note|It is needed to note Guénon was a hard opponent of the Theosophists, for example, he wrote, "The best way to fight Theosophy is, in our opinion, to display its history for what it is."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=291}}}}

=== Other point of view ===
An Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=197}} wrote that, in modern interpretations of the Theosophical doctrine, one can come across the concept of "philosophy of Theosophy." In accordance with this logic, Theosophy should contain, in addition to philosophy, other aspects and manifestations. The specificity of Theosophy is "integrality of the theoretical &amp; practical [approach], metaphysical &amp; existential [points of view], [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] &amp; [[immanence]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] &amp; [[particular]], [[epistemology]] &amp; [[ontology]]." The Theosophical object of knowledge, as well as philosophical one, is "universal, essential, ultimate" one. But, according to Shabanova, [Western] philosophy, striving for the essential, although it allows in its space [[irrationality]], [[mysticism]], or intuitionism, rationally explains the features of the world picture.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=22}}

In Shabanova's opinion, the term "Theosophy" is often applied to the Theosophical teachings, which can be considered the "body of Theosophy." It is necessary, she wrote, to distinguish, first, the transcendental basis of Theosophy as its "universal core," secondly, Theosophy as a "state of consciousness," and thirdly, Theosophy as a systematically formulated teaching. If "Divine wisdom" is the absolute Truth, then "''the Theosophical doctrine''" reflects the facets of this Truth, represented through "enlightened consciousness" and framed in certain knowledge and representations. Thus, the Theosophical teaching is not Truth, but only a "description" of it. To be proficient in the Theosophical knowledge does not yet mean reaching the "Theosophical state of consciousness," because the accumulation of knowledge is not sufficient for the attainment of "Wisdom." She claimed that the Theosophical teaching gets meaning through the [[self-realization]] of man, which is a "way of awakening the Divine wisdom."{{refn|group=note|Professor [[I. K. Taimni|Iqbal Taimni]] stated, "Hindu religious teachers called [[Rishi]]s were philosophers, and the great philosophers were generally [[Yogi]]s."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=xxvii}}}} Shabanova noted a "synthetic character" of the Theosophical teachings, which conditioned by the syncretic nature of the "transcendental nucleus" of Theosophy. For this reason, Theosophy can not be expressed in the form of an "ultimate doctrine," and its various interpretations lead to contradictions both within the Theosophical Society and in external assessments.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|pp=19–21}}

Blavatsky's definition of Theosophy is quoted in a book by Shabanova:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Theosophy is... the archaic ''Wisdom-Religion,'' the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization. This 'Wisdom' all the old writings show us as an emanation of the divine Principle; and the clear comprehension of it is typified in such names as the Indian [[Budha]], the Babylonian [[Nabu|Nebo]], the [[Thoth]] of Memphis, the [[Hermes]] of Greece; in the appellations, also, of some goddesses—[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Neith]]a, [[Athena]], the [[Gnostic]] ''[[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]],'' and finally the [[Vedas]], from the word 'to know.' Under this designation, all the ancient philosophers of the East and West, the [[Hierophant]]s of old Egypt, the [[Rishi]]s of [[Aryavarta]], the [[Theodidaktos|Theodidaktoi]] of Greece, included all knowledge of things occult and essentially divine."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1967|1p=89|Шабанова|2016|2p=24}}{{refn|group=note|[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that, according to the explanation of Blavatsky, her Theosophy "is not a religion, but it is divine knowledge or science," and the very term applies not to God, but to the gods or to any divine being, and it is not God's wisdom, but the divine wisdom, i. e. that belongs to the gods at all.{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911a|p=287}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Shabanova wrote that, according to Blavatsky, "Theosophy in its fruition is spiritual knowledge itself—the very essence of philosophical and theistic enquiry." And the genuine Theosophists should have faith in the intangible, omnipotent, omnipresent, and invisible Cause, which "is '''All''', and '''Nothing'''; ubiquitous yet one; the Essence filling, binding, bounding, containing everything; contained in all."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1pp=5–6|Шабанова|2016|2p=25}}

In 1879, the originator of modern Theosophy first presented the statement on "a single Supreme Essence, Unknown and ''Unknowable''" which was the "central idea of the [[Eclecticism|Eclectic]] Theosophy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1967|1p=90|Santucci|2012|2p=234|Шабанова|2016|3p=24}} This statement was later developed by Blavatsky in the proem to ''The Secret Doctrine'' where it is said that there is "an Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable '''Principle''' on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888|1p=14|Percival|1905|2p=205|Santucci|2012|3p=234|Шабанова|2016|4p=91}}{{refn|group=note|As professor Taimni said, "Wisdom can come only from true religion and philosophy."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=xxiv}}}}

== Blavatsky about philosophy ==
=== "Philosophers and Philosophicules" ===
A religious studies scholar Arnold Kalnitsky wrote that in Blavatsky's article "Philosophers and Philosophicules"{{sfn|Blavatsky|1973}} it is about "the issues of philosophy from the Theosophical perspective."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=147}}{{refn|group=note|This article was first published in 1889 in the Theosophical magazine ''[[Lucifer (magazine)|Lucifer]].'' Later it was included in the 11th volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1973}}}} The article author believes that Theosophy deserves respect as a serious intellectual activity, basing on publicly voiced philosophical principles.{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] claimed, "Philosophy, not less than religion, bears the stamp of theosophical ideology."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=6}}}} According to Kalnitsky, to avoid confusion, she says Theosophy cannot be reduced to a single form of knowledge or intellectual activity, "Theosophy is certainly not a philosophy, simply because it includes every philosophy as every science and religion."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=434|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=148}}

Kalnitsky wrote that the article author fully convinced that Theosophy should be "life blood" of philosophy, which is defined as "the science of things divine and human, and the causes in which they are contained." Also she believes that only Theosophy has the "keys" to these causes.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=149}} Blavatsky claims that philosophy was "crystallization point" of various forms of knowledge, and he quoted in this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When applied to [[god]] or gods, it became in every country [[theology]]; when to material nature, it was called [[physics]] and natural history; concerned with man, it appeared as [[anthropology]] and [[psychology]]; and when raised to the higher regions it becomes known as [[metaphysics]]. Such is philosophy—'the science of effects by their causes'—the very spirit of the doctrine of [[Karma]], the most important teaching under various names of every religious philosophy, and a theosophical tenet that belongs to no one religion but explains them all. Philosophy is also called 'the science of things possible, inasmuch as they are possible'."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=434|Kalnitsky|2003|2pр=149–50}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Theosophy and Hegelianism ===
In Kalnitsky's opinion, in hers article Blavatsky trying apparently to get a "legitimation" her Theosophical ideas, arguing that they are not at variance with the views of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] on the essence of philosophy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hegel regards it as 'the contemplation of the self-development of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|'''Absolute''']]', or in other words as 'the representation of the Idea' ({{lang-de|Darstellung der Idee}}). The whole of the [[Esoteric|Secret]] [[Philosophy|Doctrine]]—of which the work bearing that name is but an atom—is such a contemplation and record, as far as finite language and limited thought can record the processes of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Infinite]]."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=435|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=151}}{{refn|group=note|A Russian philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that for the Theosophical [[gnosticism]], just like for [[Hegelianism]], God and the world are "in principle cognizable."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Vladimir Solovyov, philosophy, as a revelation of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] in its absolute form, was adopted by Hegel not as a collection of various systems but as the gradual implementation of a true single system.{{sfn|Соловьёв|1914|p=317}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus, according to Blavatsky, the Theosophical Secret Doctrine is the most complete and "mature" expression "of philosophical activity", which is carried out as "such a contemplation and record" of the Absolute.{{refn|group=note|"The Absolute is the Ultimate Reality or [[Parabrahman]] of Hindu philosophy."{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=67}}}} Kalnitsky wrote that, turning to the Hegelian theory and trying to find herein "substantial doctrinal parallels," she aims to consolidate her philosophical authority. Hegel's system, like most other idealist trends in philosophy, gave many useful concepts Theosophists, but in most cases, the Theosophical views differed with them due to a number of distinctions in basic positions.{{refn|group=note|Abbott Clark wrote that Blavatskian Theosophy, "considered as a philosophy, is an [[objective idealism]], because it postulates the Cosmos as the product of Cosmic Ideation and the imbodiment of consciousness."{{sfn|Clark|1942}} However, professor [[Robert Ellwood]] claimed that Theosophy "is not some form of [[metaphysical idealism]] or mentalism which says that consciousness is ''prior'' to matter." He wrote, "What is prior is not consciousness as we know it but the Unknown Root from which both consciousness and matter stem."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014|p=28}}}} In terms of Theosophists, philosophical activity was considered barren without occult and [[Mysticism|mystical]] assumptions, and intelligent searches have been justified only if they have provided evidence of their beliefs.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|pp=151–2}}

Kalnitsky wrote that, defining "Theosophical speculation" as an act of true philosophy, Blavatsky states that the commonality of purposes eliminates traditional religious restrictions, "Thus it becomes evident that Theosophy cannot be a 'religion', still less 'a sect', but it is indeed the quintessence of the highest philosophy in all and every one of its aspects."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=435|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=152}} In his opinion, Blavatsky's statement that Theosophy is the "synthesis" and something "big" compared to any discipline or type of knowledge is inevitably present certain amount of linguistic confusion and contradictions. She claims that her Theosophy should be regarded as "the quintessence of the highest philosophy in all and every one of its aspects" and that it "cannot be a religion." Trying to preserve the religious, philosophical and scientific tradition, she insists on prevailing over all synthetic and inclusive status of Theosophy, using a rhetorical technique, when '''a''' seems minor compared to '''the'''. Thus, Theosophy is not simply '''a''' religion, philosophy or science, but '''the''' more authoritative and reliable source that covers and synthesizes them. In this case, Theosophy seems "'''the''' quintessence of the highest philosophy." He wrote that it should be noted "continual irritation" of the article author against any attempt to interpret Theosophy as a privileged religion or sect, which is for her a challenge, requiring immediate transition to protection by the proclamation that Theosophy avoids dogmatism and aims to be inclusive.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=152}}

According to Kalnitsky, Blavatsky was sure that she was able to prove Theosophy can match with any definition of philosophy, and there is a general philosophical principles which the Theosophy does not contradict. She quotes [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], who said that philosophy is "a search for principles, sensible and abstract truths," as well as the use of reason "to its legitimate objects." She believes that Theosophy is completely legitimate and reliable means of achieving these goals, especially relating to the nature of "the [[Soul|Ego]], or mental Self" and the relationship between "the ideal and the real." That is why in theory she perceive Theosophy, albeit with some limitations, as the equivalent of philosophy. Blavatsky believes that "he who studies Theosophy, studies the highest [[transcendental philosophy]]." In Kalnitsky's opinion, linking the Theosophical system with the tradition of philosophical reasoning, and assuming similar purposes, she trying to achieve for herself greater respectability and authority.{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=436|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=153}}

=== Versus unspiritual philosophism ===
At the end of hers article Blavatsky resorts to accusatory rhetoric, trying once again to show that Theosophy often is beyond the horizon of the people who might recognize it. Kalnitsky noted, "She compares her situation to that of [[Socrates]]," claiming that if his teachings was would rejected because of the charges against him, then knowledge, which was transmitted through [[Plato]] and philosophers-[[Neoplatonism|neoplatonists]] would never came up to us. Blavatsky, again turning her attention to modern philosophical mood, contemptuously speaks of those, who engage in unspiritual philosophizing. Speaking about the "true philosophers," she makes the following observation, and Kalnitsky quoted it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A [[Skepticism|sceptic]] can never aspire to that title. He who is capable of imagining the universe with its handmaiden Nature fortuitous, and hatched like the [[Black Pullet|black hen]] of the fable, out of a self-created egg hanging in space, has neither the power of thinking nor the spiritual faculty of perceiving abstract truths; which power and faculty are the first requisites of a philosophical mind. We see the entire realm of modern Science honeycombed with such [[Materialism|materialists]], who yet claim to be regarded as philosophers. They either believe in naught as do the [[Secularism|Secularists]], or doubt according to the manner of the [[Agnosticism|Agnostics]]."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1pp=438–9|Kalnitsky|2003|2pp=153–4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Blavatsky believed that a priori assumption about the spiritual basis of reality determines the truth of any philosophy.{{refn|group=note|According to Indian philosophy's teachings, the world "open to the senses is not the whole world of nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2010|loc=Chap. 5/16}} Ellwood stated that, according to Theosophy: "Our ultimate environment is infinite Reality itself. It is also our closest environment, for it is manifested in everything, including ourselves."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014|p=8}}}} Kalnitsky wrote that in the final part of hers article she "exalts" [[deductive reasoning]] of Plato,{{refn|group=note|Alvin Kuhn noted, "It is significant that Madame Blavatsky's occult philosophy aims to restore to scientific method the deductive procedure."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=264}}}} comparing it with [[inductive reasoning]] of modern thinkers: "None of our present [[Darwinism|Darwinians]], and materialists and their admirers, our critics, could have studied philosophy otherwise than very 'superficially'. Hence while Theosophists have a legitimate right to the title of ''philosophers''—true 'lovers of Wisdom'—their critics and slanderers are at best '''Philosophicules'''—the progeny of modern '''Philosophism'''."{{Sfnm|Blavatsky|1973|1p=439|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=154}}{{refn|group=note|According to Clark, Blavatsky has humorously called the modern inductive philosophers, "philosophicules."{{sfn|Clark|1942}}}}

== Philosophers' criticism ==
;René Guénon
He called Blavatskian Theosophy a "theosophism" ({{lang-fr|théosophisme}}) and described it in his book as a "pseudo-religion." He wrote that presented by the Theosophical Society's leaders assertion about the alleged the "Eastern origin" of their doctrine was false, and its initial tendency was overtly anti-Christian. According to him, between the doctrine of the Theosophical Society, or, at least, that ones was proclaimed and Theosophy in the true sense of the word, there is absolutely no affinity:{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=3}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is after all only a confused mixture of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, [[Jewish Kabbalah]], [[Hermeticism]], and [[occultism]], the whole of it being gathered as well as can be expressed around two or three ideas which, whether one likes it or not, are of completely modern and purely Western origin."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|pp=91–2}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his opinion, the Theosophical conceptions of evolution "are basically only an absurd caricature of the Hindu theory of cosmic cycles."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=100}} He wrote that Theosophy "must be placed quite simply, along with [[spiritism]] and the different occultist schools to which it is obviously related, in the collection of bizarre productions of the contemporary mentality to which may be given the general name of '[[René Guénon#Contemporary "neo-spiritualism"|neo-spiritualism]].'"{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=108}}

;Vladimir Solovyov, and other 
A Russian philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] wrote that the main theories and doctrines of the Theosophical Society "seem to us very shaky and vague."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911a|p=291}} Blavatsky created, he explained, a "pseudo-Theosophical" Society, because hers teaching "is untenable and false." Thus, modern Theosophy is a doctrine not only "anti-religious" and "anti-scientific," but also "antiphilosophic."{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911b|pp=395– 8}}

A religious philosopher [[Sergius Bulgakov]] stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a "vulgar pseudoscientific mythology."{{sfn|Bulgakov|2012|p=37}} In [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]'s opinion, "contemporary 'theosophical' movements" corrupted the beautiful word 'Theosophy' and "have made us forget" the existence of a genuine "Christian theosophy". He believed that modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a "mixture" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science.{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|pp=270, 299}} Also besides he stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is difficult to find creative thinkers among the Theosophists. The median level of the Theosophical books is not very high. Theosophists fight independent thoughts and are little interested by the multiplicity of creative processes, that occur outside their circle. The seclusive closed-in circle is very characteristic for the Theosophical... setting."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A Russian philosopher [[:ru:Лесевич, Владимир Викторович|Vladimir Lesevich]], firmly believing philosophical ignorance of Blavatsky, tartly noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"What kind of audience they [the Theosophists] will snared, you can see from the witty expose the charlatanical tricks of Mme Blavatsky, who began a discuss the philosophy of Plato and talked a lot of all kinds of nonsense. Exposing all this nonsense shows full justice to the characteristics of the logical methods unscrupulous author of ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', who, appears, imagines itself that if she said anything a three-fold, the sentence has to be considered proven."{{sfn|Лесевич|1887|p=17}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An employee of the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of philosophy]] Lydia Fesenkova also severely criticized the occult statements of Blavatsky, which described anthropogenesis, "From the point of view of science, such beliefs are an explicit profanity and don't have the right to exist in the serious literature."{{sfn|Фесенкова|2004|p=93}}

'''Hsu Fu-kuan''' or '''Xu Fuguan''' ({{zh|t=徐復觀}}); 1902/03 – 1982) was a Chinese intellectual and historian who made notable contributions to [[Confucian]] studies. He is a leading member of [[New Confucianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Routledge history of world philosophies : history of Chinese philosophy | editor= Bo Mou | year= 2008 | publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis | page=539 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=roLT-2IqRScC&amp;pg=PA539| isbn= 9780203002865 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a philosophical movement initiated by Xu's teacher and friend, [[Xiong Shili]]. Other important members of the New Confucian Movement include Xu's two friends and professorial colleagues who also studied with Xiong Shili: [[Mou Zongsan]] and [[Tang Junyi]].

== Biography ==

Xu was born in 1902 or 1903&lt;ref&gt;Conflicting sources, cited by Mathias Obert&lt;/ref&gt; in a family of farmer scholars in [[Hubei]] Province, China. Hsu's father taught at a private school established for village children who showed academic promise and could sit the imperial examinations to become scholar officials. In his teen-age years, Xu made his way to the provincial capital Wuhan which was then the cultural center where foreign influences and trends abounded. Wuhan was also an important staging area for the 1911 Republican Revolution that ended China's 2000-year-old imperial rule. Xu spent fifteen years with the Nationalist army attaining the rank of senior colonel. Trusted by [[Kuomintang]] leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]], Xu was sent to [[Yan'an]] to discuss Nationalist and Communist cooperation against the invading Japanese. In Yan'an, Xu met senior Communist officials including [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhou Enlai]]. After leaving the army, Xu then took various teaching positions, published a scholarly magazine, and then involved himself in politics, working as an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek until 1946. He then devoted himself to "the study of books" (editing,academic papers) on the island of Taiwan where the Nationalists had retreated in 1949. Between 1955 and 1969, he taught in the Chinese Department of [[Tunghai University]]. Because the university had no philosophy department, Xu welcomed students interested in philosophy into the Chinese Department. Many of these students, such as [[Tu Weiming]], rose to academic prominence. Xu also taught at the ''[[New Asia Research Institute]]'' in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Mathias Obert, "La pensée esthétique de Xu Fuguan (1902-1982)", in : ''Revue internationale de philosophie'', 2/2005 (n° 232), p. 267-285. ([http://www.cairn.info/revue-internationale-de-philosophie-2005-2-page-267.htm online])&lt;/ref&gt;

Xu was a prolific writer and thinker and his collected works run to several volumes. While in both Taiwan and Hong Kong, Xu wrote frequently for newspapers. Xu was the driving force behind the 1958 manifesto on Chinese Culture that is viewed by many scholars as a crowning achievement of New Confucianism. Regarding this manifesto, Xinzhong Yao states:
"The first effort in reviving Confucianism in the 1950s was a document drawn up by Tang Junyi, Mou Zongsan, [[Zhang Junmai]] and Xu Fuguan and published on the first day of 1958, entitled 'A Declaration of Chinese Culture to the Scholars of the World' (wei zhongguo wenhua jinggao shijie renshi xuanyan 为中国文化敬告世界人士宣言). The declaration restates the authors' concerns about the direction of human development, the value of Chinese culture, and urges Western and Chinese scholars to understand Chinese culture, claiming that without a proper understanding of Chinese culture, the perception of China will be distorted and the Chinese will have no future."&lt;ref&gt;Hsin-chung Yao, ''An Introduction to Confucianism'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Xu died in Hong Kong in 1982.&lt;5&gt;
