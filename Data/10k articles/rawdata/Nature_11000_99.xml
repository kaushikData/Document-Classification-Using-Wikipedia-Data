== Botanical information ==

===Phylogeny and anatomy===
[[File:Bili Tree CM Farm Saldi.jpg|thumb|Bili tree]]
Bael is the only member of the monotypic genus ''Aegle''.&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; It is a deciduous shrub or small to medium-sized tree, up to 13m tall with slender drooping branches and rather shabby crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field guide to forest trees of Northern Thailand|last=Gardner|first=Simon|publisher=Kobfai Publishing Project|year=2007|isbn=978-974-8367-29-3|location=Bangkok|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bark ===
The bark is pale brown or grayish, smooth or finely fissured and flaking, armed with long straight spines, 1.2-2.5&amp;nbsp;cm singly or in pairs, often with slimy sap oozing out from cut parts. The gum is also described as a clear, gummy sap, resembling gum arabic, which exudes from wounded branches and hangs down in long strands, becoming gradually solid. It is sweet at first taste and then irritating to the throat.&lt;ref name="Orwa"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Aegle marmelos |work=Agroforestree Database:a tree reference and selection guide version 4.0|last=Orwa|first=C|date=2009 |url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb/AFTPDFS/Aegle_marmelos.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509095056/http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb/AFTPDFS/Aegle_marmelos.PDF |archive-date=9 May 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaf ===
The leaf is trifoliate, alternate, each leaflet 5-14 x 2–6&amp;nbsp;cm, ovate with tapering or pointed tip and rounded base, untoothed or with shallow rounded teeth. Young leaves are pale green or pinkish, finely hairy while mature leaves are dark green and completely smooth. Each leaf has 4-12 pairs of side veins which are joined at the margin.

=== Flower ===
The flowers are 1.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;cm, pale green or yellowish, sweetly scented, bisexual, in short drooping unbranched clusters at the end of twigs and leaf axils. They usually appear with young leaves. The calyx is flat with 4(5) small teeth. The four or five petals of 6–8&amp;nbsp;mm overlap in the bud. Many stamens have short filaments and pale brown, short style anthers. The ovary is bright green with an inconspicuous disc.

=== Fruit ===
[[File:Bael (Aegle marmelos) fruit at Narendrapur W IMG 4099.jpg|thumb|150 px|A ripe bael fruit in India]]
[[File:Bael15 Mounts Asit.jpg|thumb|right|140 px|Bael fruit]]
The bael fruit typically has a diameter of between 5 and 12&amp;nbsp; cm. It is globose or slightly pear-shaped with a thick, hard rind and does not split upon ripening. The woody shell is smooth and green, gray until it is fully ripe when it turns yellow. Inside are 8 to 15 or 20 sections filled with aromatic orange pulp, each section with 6 (8) to 10 (15) flattened-oblong seeds each about 1&amp;nbsp; cm long, bearing woolly hairs and each enclosed in a sac of adhesive, transparent mucilage that solidifies on drying. The exact number of seeds varies in different publications.

It takes about 11 months to ripen on the tree and can reach the size of a large [[grapefruit]] or [[pomelo]], and some are even larger. The shell is so hard it must be cracked with a [[hammer]] or [[machete]]. The fibrous yellow pulp is very aromatic. It has been described as tasting of [[marmalade]] and smelling of roses. Boning (2006) indicates that the flavor is "sweet, aromatic and pleasant, although tangy and slightly astringent in some varieties. It resembles a marmalade made, in part, with citrus and, in part, with tamarind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boning|first=Charles|title=Florida's Best Fruiting Plants: Native and Exotic Trees, Shrubs, and Vines|year=2006|publisher=Pineapple Press, Inc.|location=Sarasota, Florida|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous hairy seeds are encapsulated in a slimy [[mucilage]].

===Range and ecology===
[[File:Aegle marmelos plant.jpg|thumb|150px|''Aegle marmelos'' plant]]

''Aegle marmelos'' is native across the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]], and is cultivated throughout [[Sri Lanka]], Thailand and [[Malesia]].&lt;ref name=GRIN/&gt; It occurs in dry, open [[forests]] on hills and plains at altitudes from sea level to around 1200m with mean annual rainfall of 570-2,000&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="Orwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; It has a reputation in India for being able to grow in places that other trees cannot. It copes with a wide range of soil conditions ([[pH]] range 5-10), is tolerant of waterlogging and has an unusually wide temperature tolerance (from -7&amp;nbsp;°C to 48&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; It requires a pronounced dry season to give fruit. The tree is a [[larva]]l foodplant for the following two Indian [[Swallowtail butterfly|Swallowtail]] [[Butterfly|butterflies]], the Lime butterfly ''[[Papilio demoleus]],'' and the Common Mormon: ''[[Papilio polytes]]''.

== Food uses ==

The fruits can be eaten either fresh from trees or after being [[drying|dried]] and produced into candy, [[toffee]], pulp powder or [[nectar]].&lt;ref name=hort/&gt; If fresh, the juice is [[strainer|strained]] and [[Food sweetening|sweetened]] to make a [[drink]] similar to [[lemonade]]. It can be made into [[sharbat]] or ''Bela pana'', a beverage. [[Bela Pana]] made in [[Odisha]] has fresh cheese, milk, water, fruit pulp, sugar, crushed black pepper, and ice. ''Bæl pana'', a drink made of the pulp with water, sugar, and [[citron]] juice, is mixed, left to stand a few hours, strained, and put on ice. One large bael fruit may yield five or six liters of sharbat. If the fruit is to be dried, it is usually sliced and sun-dried. The hard leathery slices are then immersed in water. The [[Leaf|leaves]] and small [[shoots]] are eaten as [[salad greens]].

== Chemical compounds ==
The bael tree contains [[furocoumarins]], including [[xanthotoxol]] and the methyl ester of alloimperatorin, as well as [[flavonoid]]s, [[rutin]] and [[marmesin]]; a number of essential oils; and, among its alkaloids, á-fargarine(=allocryptopine), ''O''-isopentenylhalfordinol, ''O''-methylhafordinol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Rasadah Mat Ali |author2=Zainon Abu Samah |author3=Nik Musaadah Mustapha |author4=Norhara Hussein |year=2010 |title=Aegle marmelos (L.): In ASEAN Herbal and Medicinal Plants (page 107)|location=Jakarta, Indonesia |publisher=Association of Southeast Asian Nations |page=43 |isbn= 978-979-3496-92-4 |url=http://www.asean.org/uploads/archive/publications/aseanherbal2010.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612173850/http://www.asean.org/uploads/archive/publications/aseanherbal2010.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2017 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aegeline (N-[2-hydroxy-2(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl]-3-phenyl-2-propenamide) is a constituent that can be [[extract|extracted]] from bael leaves.&lt;ref name="drugtest"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=5579712|title=Hepatotoxicity associated with weight loss or sports dietary supplements, including OxyELITE Pro™ - United States, 2013|journal=Drug Test Anal|year=2017|volume=9|issue=1|pages=68-74|doi=10.1002/dta.2036|vauthors=Chatham-Stephens K, Taylor E, Chang A, Peterson A, Daniel J, Martin C, Deuster P, Noe R, Kieszak S, Schier J, Klontz K, Lewis L|display-authors=3|pmid=27367536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avula"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27054911|year=2016|author1=Avula|first1=B|title=Simultaneous Determination of Aegeline and Six Coumarins from Different Parts of the Plant ''Aegle marmelos'' Using UHPLC-PDA-MS and Chiral Separation of Aegeline Enantiomers Using HPLC-ToF-MS|journal=Planta Medica|volume=82|issue=6|pages=580–8|last2=Chittiboyina|first2=A.

==Aegeline and liver injury==

Aegeline is a known constituent of the bael leaf and consumed as a [[dietary supplement]] with the intent to produce weight loss.&lt;ref name=drugtest/&gt;&lt;ref name=avula/&gt; In 2013, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the Department of Defense Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, and [[Hawaii]] state and local health officials identified an outbreak of 97 persons with acute non-viral [[hepatitis]] that first emerged in Hawaii. Seventy-two of these persons had reported using the [[dietary supplement]] OxyElite Pro which contained aegeline.&lt;ref name=drugtest/&gt;&lt;ref name=FDA2014&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Investigation Summary: Acute Hepatitis Illnesses Linked to Certain OxyElite Pro Products|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20171114154924/https://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/Outbreaks/ucm370849.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=19 November 2015|date=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FDA had previously taken action against an earlier formulation of OxyElite Pro because it contained [[dimethylamylamine]], a stimulant that FDA had determined to be an [[adulterant]] when included in dietary supplements and could cause high blood pressure and lead to heart attacks, seizures, psychiatric disorders, and death.&lt;ref name=FDA2014/&gt; USPlabs subsequently reformulated this product without informing FDA or submitting the required safety data for a new dietary ingredient.&lt;ref name=FDA2014/&gt;

Doctors at the Liver Center at [[The Queen's Medical Center]] investigating the first cases in Hawaii reported that between May and September 2013, eight previously healthy individuals presented themselves at their center suffering from a drug-induced liver injury.&lt;ref name=drugtest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roytman2014&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Roytman MM, Pörzgen P, Lee CL, Huddleston L, Kuo TT, Bryant-Greenwood P, Wong LL, Tsai N|display-authors=3|title=Outbreak of severe hepatitis linked to weight-loss supplement OxyELITE Pro|journal=Am J Gastroenterol|date=August 2014|volume=109|issue=8|pages=1296–8|doi=10.1038/ajg.2014.159|pmid=25091255}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these patients had been using the reformulated OxyELITE Pro, which they had purchased from different sources, and which had different lot numbers and expiration dates, at doses within the manufacturer's recommendation.&lt;ref name=drugtest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roytman2014/&gt; Three of these patients developed fulminant liver failure, two underwent urgent liver transplantation, and one died.&lt;ref name=drugtest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roytman2014/&gt; The number of such cases would ultimately rise to 44 in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=drugtest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roytman2014/&gt; In January 2014, leaders from the Queen's Liver Center informed state lawmakers that they were almost certain that aegeline was the agent responsible for these cases,&lt;ref name=Daysong2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daysong|first1=Rick|title=Months after recall, new OxyElite Pro illnesses reported|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/24561216/exclusive|accessdate=19 November 2015|work=Hawaii News Now|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[mechanism of action|mechanism]] of how aegeline may damage the liver has not been isolated.&lt;ref name=drugtest/&gt;

==United States lawsuits==

On November 17, 2015, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] criminally charged USPlabs and several of its corporate affiliates and officers with eleven counts of charges for manufacturing and marketing products that threaten consumer health.&lt;ref name=doj2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Department and Federal Partners Announce Enforcement Actions of Dietary Supplement Cases: Criminal Charges Brought against Bestselling Supplement Manufacturer|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-federal-partners-announce-enforcement-actions-dietary-supplement-cases|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=3 March 2018|date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges surrounded an alleged conspiracy to import ingredients from China using false certificates of analysis and labeling, and lying about the ingredients' source and nature after inclusion in their products.&lt;ref name=doj2015/&gt; The various defendants surrendered or were arrested by the [[United States Marshals Service]], and FDA and special agents from the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] seized assets including investment accounts, real estate, and luxury and sports cars.&lt;ref name=doj2015/&gt; This capped a yearlong sweep of potentially unsafe or tainted supplements that resulted in civil injunctions and criminal actions against 117 manufacturers and/or distributors of dietary supplements and products falsely marketed as such but containing banned or unauthorized ingredients.&lt;ref name=doj2015/&gt; As of December 2016, USPlabs was awaiting federal trial on [[conspiracy]] and other criminal charges related to OxyElite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=December 7, 2016: GNC Enters Into Agreement with Department of Justice to Improve Its Practices and Keep Potentially Illegal Dietary Supplements Out of the Marketplace|url=https://www.fda.gov/iceci/criminalinvestigations/ucm533077.htm|publisher=Office of Criminal Investigations, US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=3 March 2018|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious beliefs==

Bael is used in the ritual rites of Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peg|first1=Streep|title=Spiritual Gardening: Creating Sacred Space Outdoors|date=2003|publisher=New World Library|isbn=9781930722248|url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=olAvkAfA3zIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bakh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakhru|first1=HK|title=Foods That Heal|date=1995|publisher=Orient Paperbacks|isbn=9788122200331|pages=28–30|url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=jyqzV-tcDRQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bael is considered as one of the sacred trees of Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panda|first1=H|title=Medicinal Plants Cultivation &amp; Their Uses|date=2002|publisher=Asia Pacific Business Press Inc.|isbn=9788178330969|page=159|url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=nYyuAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earliest evidence of religious importance of Bael appears in ''Shri Shuktam'' of [[Rig Veda]] which reveres this plant as the residence of goddess [[Lakshmi]], the deity of wealth and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astrological Magazine, Volume 92|date=2003|publisher=Raman Publications|page=48|url=https://books.google.lk/books?id=s7Z-AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bael trees can be usually seen near the Hindu temples and their home gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=S.M.

Ishii|title=Micropropagation of Woody Trees and Fruits Volume 75 of Forestry Sciences|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401001250}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Hindu deity Lord [[Shiva]] is fond of bael tree and its leaves and fruit still play a main role in his worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lim|first1=T.

In the traditional practice of the Hindu and Buddhist religions by people of the [[Newar people|Newar]] culture of [[Nepal]], the bael tree is part of a [[fertility]] ritual for [[girl]]s known as the ''[[Ehee|Bel Bibaaha]]''. Girls are "married" to the bael fruit; as long as the fruit is kept safe and never cracks, the girl can never become widowed, even if her human husband dies. This is seen to be protection against the social disdain suffered by widows in the Newar community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gutschow, Niels | author2 = Michaels, Axel | author3 = Bau, Christian | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2008 | chapter = The Girl's Hindu Marriage to the Bel Fruit: Ihi ''and'' The Girl's Buddhist Marriage to the Bel Fruit: Ihi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DK-eoCXM_WsC | title = Growing Up—Hindu and Buddhist Initiation Ritual among Newar Children in Bhaktapur, Nepal | location = Wiesbaden, GER | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag | isbn = 3447057521 | pages = 93–173 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew James Watson''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (born 1952) is a British marine and atmospheric scientist and an expert in processes affecting atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]] concentrations. He was formerly a Professor of [[biogeochemistry]] in the School of Environmental Sciences at the [[University of East Anglia]], in 2013 he moved to a position as Professor at the College of Life and Environmental Sciences at the [[University of Exeter]].

==Earth Sciences==
Watson graduated with a first class BSc in physics from [[Imperial College London]] in 1975. He then became a PhD student of [[James Lovelock]], originator of the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of Earth regulation, at the [[University of Reading]]. He and Lovelock introduced the [[Daisyworld]] model in 1983, showing how [[Competition (biology)|ecological competition]] between hypothetical "daisies" could affect planetary [[albedo]] and regulate environmental temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. J. and J. E. Lovelock (1983). Biological homeostasis of the global environment: the parable of Daisyworld. Tellus 35B, 284-289&lt;/ref&gt; Watson and his students have subsequently developed ''a priori'' models for the regulation of atmospheric composition through geological time. He has applied the weak [[Anthropic Principle]] to evolution on Earth,&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. J., (2004). Gaia and observer self-selection. In Scientists debate Gaia: the next century,  eds Schneider, S. H., Miller, J. R., Crist, E., and Boston, P. J.  pp201-208. MIT press, Cambridge,  Mass, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that long-term regulation of the Earth’s temperature and environment may be a necessary pre-requisite to allow sufficient time for the evolution of complex life and intelligence, rather than an intrinsic property of the biosphere as Lovelock proposed.

==Tracing ocean waters==
While at the [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|Marine Biological Association]] and [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]] in the 1980s, he developed techniques for tracking ocean water bodies using tracers such as [[sulphur hexafluoride]] and [[perfluorodecalin]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. J., Liddicoat, M. I. and J. R. Ledwell (1987). "Perfluorodecalin and sulphur hexafluoride as purposeful marine tracers: some deployment and analysis techniques." Deep-Sea Research, 34, 19-31.&lt;/ref&gt; He and colleagues applied these to measure the slow mixing vertical rates in the ocean,&lt;ref&gt;Ledwell, J. R., Watson, A. J., and Law, C. S. (1993). Evidence of slow mixing across the pycnocline from an open ocean tracer release experiment. Nature. 364, 701-703&lt;/ref&gt; and to trace the movement of patches of surface water.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. J., Upstill-Goddard R. C. and P. S. Liss (1991). Air- sea gas exchange in rough and stormy seas measured by a dual- tracer technique. Nature 349, 145-147.&lt;/ref&gt; He also applied the technology to enable [[iron fertilization]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, A. J.,P. S. Liss, and R. A. Duce (1992). Design of a small-scale iron fertilisation experiment. Limnology and Oceanography 36, 1960-1965&lt;/ref&gt; More than a dozen such experiments have now been carried out&lt;ref&gt;. Boyd, P. W., et al., (2007). Mesoscale iron-enrichment experiments 1993-2005: synthesis and future directions. Science 315, 612-61&lt;/ref&gt; and have proved that iron is an essential limiting nutrient in important areas of the world ocean.

==Popular Publications==
Watson published the popular book ''Revolutions that Made the Earth''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Revolutions-that-Made-Earth-Lenton/dp/0199587043/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1299245321&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/ref&gt; with colleague [[Tim Lenton]] in 2011.

'''Arabia Mountain''' is the northern of two peaks in the [[Davidson-Arabia Mountain Nature Preserve]], in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]], United States. A low saddle separates it from Bradley Mountain, several hundred feet to its south.  The two form a [[monadnock]]. The peak is 955 feet (290m) above sea level, rising 172 feet (52m) above [[Arabia Lake]] reservoir. Bradley Mountain is closer to the visitor trails than Arabia Mountain and is often mis-identified by visitors as Arabia Mountain.

==Geology and history==
[[File:Bulletin 426 Plate XXVII B Arabia Mountain Quarry.jpg|thumb|left|A quarry at Arabia Mountain, c. 1910]]
Arabia Mountain is one of Metro Atlanta's three [[Monadnock|monadnocks]], which also include [[Stone Mountain]] and [[Panola Mountain]]. The unique topography and geology of this monadnock allows for unusual plant and animal species to thrive.  Arabia Mountain has five species that are listed as both state and federally endangered, including the bright-red diamorpha plant that lives in small pools of water (known as vernal pools or solution pits) that form on the monadnock.&lt;ref&gt;arabiaaliance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Panola Mountain is 3.63 miles (5.84&amp;nbsp;km) to the southwest. While designated as one peak on [[USGS]] maps, most users familiar with the area consider the rock formation to be two peaks: Arabia Mountain to the northeast, and Bradley Mountain to the southeast, connected by a low saddle.

Arabia Mountain appears to be composed of [[granite]], like other nearby peaks such as [[Stone Mountain]] and [[Panola Mountain]].  Although made of [[metamorphic rock]], the mountain is actually composed of [[migmatite]], metamorphosed at higher temperatures than [[gneiss]] but not sufficiently melted to become granite. The resulting ''swirl pattern'' made the rock a popular building stone and many buildings in the region were constructed with stone quarried from the Lithonia district [[quarry|quarries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arabiaalliance.org/themes/granite-technology/ Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area, ''Granite &amp; Technology'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Stone Mountain, Arabia Mountain was quarried for decades before the property was turned over to the DeKalb park system. Structures and excavations from the quarry operations can be seen throughout the park. The stone quarried from Arabia Mountain, officially called "Tidal Grey", was prized for its high structural density and compressive strength as well as its "swirl" pattern.  Tidal Grey Arabia Mountain can be seen in the construction of buildings for the U.S. Naval Academy, the Brooklyn Bridge, and street curbing in Atlanta as well as many other Georgia cities.&lt;ref&gt;arabiaalliance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1880, the stone was hand quarried but starting in 1879, workers used drills, dynamite and air compressors to “raise a ledge” or sever a large block of stone from the mass. That allowed more control over the size of the stone and large stones could be used for dimensional or building construction.The proximity to the rail road meant that the Tidal Grey could be easily transported across the country.

Another advancement to the quarrying industry at Arabia Mountain was the discovery that adding granite grit to chicken feed helped with the birds’ digestion. The Davidson family, which owned several quarries in the area, became the largest supplier of [[poultry grit]] in the world. They claimed that the sparkling particles of mica in the Stonemo grit attracted the eye and helped the chicken’s gizzard break down food.  The company was so successful in distributing their feed additive, a TIME Magazine article from 1941 reported the U.S. government allowed them to continue to operate during WWII in the name of national defense.In 1949, the Lithonia district produced nearly 1.5 million tons of granite valued at the time at $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://arabiaalliance.org/themes/granite-technology/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botany and endangered plants==
The seemingly barren landscape of Arabia Mountain is teeming with plant life specially adapted to live in the mountain's harsh environment. Arabia Mountain is one of five locations in the US where black-spored quillwort (''[[Isoetes melanospora]]'') are found. It is one of 44 locations in the US where little amphianthus (''[[Gratiola amphiantha|Amphianthus pusillus]]'') is found. These are endangered species protected by Georgia and Federal law. The largest and most important population of black-spored quillwort and one of the largest ''Amphianthus'' populations occur here. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's five-year review of these species, completed in 2008, states that "enforcement to protect sensitive areas needs improvement" in the Arabia Mountain area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fws.gov/southeast/5yearReviews/5yearreviews/3GraniteOutrcropPlants20080930.pdf| title=Three Granite Outcrop Plants – 5-year Review | author=US Fish and Wildlife Service| accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabia Mountain is one of a small number of locations in the southeastern United States where Small's [[Crassulaceae|stonecrop]] (''[[Diamorpha|Diamorpha smallii]]'') thrives (this plant is not listed as an [[endangered species]] in Georgia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fws.gov/athens/endangered/teplants.html| title=Federally Threatened and Endangered Plants found in Georgia | author=US Fish and Wildlife Service| accessdate=May 11, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090605113103/http://www.fws.gov/athens/endangered/teplants.html| archivedate= June 5, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the US, but is in Tennessee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.tn.us/environment/na/pdf/plant_list.pdf |title=Tennessee Natural Heritage Program Rare Planet List |author=Division of Natural Areas, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423171718/http://www.state.tn.us/environment/na/pdf/plant_list.pdf |archivedate=April 23, 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;). When granite and similar stone outcrops are exposed to [[erosion]], over time, small depressions, called solution pools, form where weaker rock wears away faster than surrounding rock (often assisted by [[lichen]]). Over time, these depressions fill with sand washed down from higher locations, which accumulates a small amount of [[Soil organic matter|organic]] content from decaying dead leaves and other [[detritus]], as well as rain water. Small's stonecrop then takes hold in these sandy hollows.

==Preservation==
In the 1970s, the Davidson family donated over 500 acres including Arabia Mountain and surrounding lands to DeKalb County as a nature preserve for local residents to enjoy. Since then, the Davidson-Arabia Mountain Nature Preserve has been expanded several times and now includes 2,550 acres, several granite outcrops and two lakes.

On October 12, 2006, the mountain and Davidson-Arabia Mountain Nature Preserve were designated as nationally significant as a part of the Arabia Mountain [[U.S. National Heritage Area|National Heritage Area]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ338.109| title=Public Law 109-338| author=Government Printing Office| accessdate=May 23, 2007| authorlink=United States Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of its cultural, historical and natural features.&lt;ref name=arabianha1&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a National Heritage Area?|url=http://arabiaalliance.org/alliance/heritage-area-designation/|work=Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area|publisher=Arabia Mountain Alliance|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bicycle trail==
The [[PATH (Atlanta)|PATH Foundation]] has completed more than 30 miles of a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} concrete road for pedestrian and bicycle use running from downtown [[Lithonia, Georgia|Lithonia]] to [[Mall at Stonecrest|Stonecrest Mall]] and thence through the Davidson-Arabia Mountain Nature Preserve to [[Panola Mountain|Panola Mountain State Park]], ending at the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Conyers. This includes a spur to a parking area on Klondike Road and a spur to the [[DeKalb County School System]]'s Murphey Candler Elementary School and Arabia Mountain High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pathfoundation.org/index.cfm?event=showArabia |title=The Arabia Mountain Trail |author=PATH Foundation |accessdate=July 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725212616/http://pathfoundation.org/index.cfm?event=showArabia |archivedate=July 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
Arabia Mountain as a [[DeKalb County, Georgia]] park is free to visitors&lt;ref&gt;http://thechampionnewspaper.com/news/local/arabia-mountain-a-county-treasure/&lt;/ref&gt; and open seven days a week from dawn to dusk. Arabia, along with [[Stone Mountain]] and [[Panola Mountain]], is also one of the mountains featured in the annual event, Monadnock Madness, which includes guided hikes of all three Metro-Atlanta monadnocks.&lt;ref&gt;monadnockmadness.com&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to year-round guided hikes,&lt;ref&gt;http://arabiaalliance.org/events/&lt;/ref&gt; the mountain also hosts arts events such as Monadnock Muse.&lt;ref&gt;http://heyevent.com/event/1619448618288647/monadnock-muse-connecting-art-and-earth&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arabia Mountain High School==
On the edge of the Arabia Mountain green space is the [[Arabia Mountain High School (Georgia)|Arabia Mountain High School Academy of Engineering Medicine and Environmental Studies]], opened August 2009. The Academy is a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building and uses the "Environment as an Integrating Context for learning" (EIC) curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seer.org | title=The EIC Model—Environment as an Integrating Context for learning | author=SEER | accessdate=April 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110430193220/http://seer.org/| archivedate= April 30, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high school is connected to the nature preserve via a spur bicycle path.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8117">In [[Reservoir Petrophysics|petrophysics]], '''Archie's law''' relates the in-situ [[electrical conductivity]] of a sedimentary rock to its [[porosity]] and [[brine]] saturation:
 
:&lt;math&gt;C_t = \frac{1}{a} C_w \phi^m S_w^n&lt;/math&gt;
 
Here, &lt;math&gt;\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; denotes the porosity, &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; the electrical conductivity of the fluid saturated rock, &lt;math&gt;C_w&lt;/math&gt; represents the electrical conductivity of the brine, &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the brine [[water saturation|saturation]], &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the cementation exponent of the rock (usually in the range 1.8&amp;ndash;2.0 for sandstones), &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the saturation exponent (usually close to 2) and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[tortuosity]] factor.

Reformulated for [[electrical resistivity]], the equation reads
:&lt;math&gt;R_t = a \phi^{-m} S_w^{-n} R_w &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; for the fluid saturated rock resistivity, and &lt;math&gt;R_w&lt;/math&gt; for the brine resistivity.

The factor
:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{a}{\phi^m} = \frac{R_o}{R_w}&lt;/math&gt;
is also called the '''formation factor''', where &lt;math&gt;R_o&lt;/math&gt; is the resistivity of the rock filled with only water (&lt;math&gt;S_w=1&lt;/math&gt;).

The factor
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{R_t}{R_o} = S_w^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;
is also called the '''resistivity index'''.

It is a purely [[empirical law]] attempting to describe [[ion]] flow (mostly [[sodium]] and [[chloride]]) in clean, consolidated sands, with varying intergranular porosity. Electrical conduction is assumed not to be present within the rock grains or in fluids other than water.

Archie's law is named after [[Gus Archie]] (1907&amp;ndash;1978) who developed this empirical quantitative relationship between porosity, electrical conductivity, and brine saturation of rocks. Archie's law laid the foundation for modern [[Well logging|well log]] interpretation as it relates borehole electrical conductivity measurements to [[hydrocarbon]] saturations (which, for fluid saturated rock, equals &lt;math&gt;1 - S_w&lt;/math&gt;).

===Cementation exponent, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;===

The [[cementation (geology)|cementation]] exponent models how much the pore network increases the resistivity, as the rock itself is assumed to be non-conductive. If the pore network were to be modelled as a set of parallel capillary tubes, a cross-section area average of the rock's resistivity would yield porosity dependence equivalent to a cementation exponent of 1. However, the [[tortuosity]] of the rock increases this to a higher number than 1. This relates the cementation exponent to the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the rock, increasing permeability decreases the cementation exponent.

The exponent &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; has been observed near 1.3 for unconsolidated sands, and is believed to increase with cementation. Common values for this cementation exponent for consolidated sandstones are 1.8 &lt; &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 2.0.
In carbonate rocks, the cementation exponent shows higher variance due to strong diagenetic affinity and complex pore structures. Values between 1.7 and 4.1 have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;Verwer, K., Eberli, G.P. and Weger, R.J., 2011, Effect of pore structure on electrical resistivity in carbonates: AAPG Bulletin, no. 20, v. 94, p. 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The cementation exponent is usually assumed not to be dependent on [[temperature]].

===Saturation exponent, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;===
The saturation exponent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; usually is fixed to values close to 2. The [[Water content|saturation]] exponent models the dependency on the presence of non-conductive fluid (hydrocarbons) in the pore-space, and is related to the [[Wetting|wettability]] of the rock. Water-wet rocks will, for low water saturation values, maintain a continuous film along the pore walls making the rock conductive. Oil-wet rocks will have discontinuous droplets of water within the pore space, making the rock less conductive.

===Tortuosity factor, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;===

The constant &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''tortuosity factor'',  ''cementation intercept'', ''lithology factor'' or, ''[[lithology]] coefficient'' is sometimes used. It is meant to correct for variation in [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]], pore structure and grain size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winsauer |first=W.O. |author2=Shearing H.M., Jr. |author3=Masson, P.H. |author4=Williams, M. |year=1952 |title=Resistivity of brine saturated sands in relation to pore geometry |journal=AAPG Bulletin |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=253–277 |doi=10.1306/3d9343f4-16b1-11d7-8645000102c1865d}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The parameter a is called the tortuosity factor and clearly is related to the path length of the current flow. The value lies in the range 0.5 to 1.5. a may be different in different reservoirs. However a typical value to start with for a sandstone reservoir might be 0.6, which then can be tuned during log data matching process with other sources of data such as core.

===Measuring the exponents===
&lt;!-- note that "Pickett plot" redirects directly to this section header --&gt;
In petrophysics, the only reliable source for the numerical value of both exponents is experiments on sand plugs from cored wells. The brine conductivity can be measured directly on produced water samples. Alternatively, the brine conductivity and the cementation exponent can also be inferred from downhole electrical conductivity measurements across brine-saturated intervals. For brine-saturated intervals (&lt;math&gt;S_w=1&lt;/math&gt;) Archie's law can be written
 
:&lt;math&gt;\log{C_t} = \log{C_w} + m \log{\phi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, plotting the logarithm of the measured in-situ electrical conductivity against the logarithm of the measured in-situ porosity ('''Pickett plot'''), according to Archie's law a straight-line relationship is expected with slope equal to the cementation exponent &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and intercept equal to the logarithm of the in-situ brine conductivity.

==Sands with clay/shaly sands==

Archie's law postulates that the rock [[matrix (geology)|matrix]] is non-conductive. For sandstone with [[clay minerals]], this assumption is no longer true in general, due to the clay's structure and [[cation exchange capacity]].  The [[Waxman–Smits equation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M.H. |last1=Waxman |first2=L.J.M. |last2=Smits |title=Electrical conductivities in oil-bearing shaly sands |journal=SPE Journal |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=107–122 |year=1968 |doi=10.2118/1863-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one model that tries to correct for this.

[[File:Atmospheric refraction.svg|thumb|Diagram showing displacement of the [[Sun]]'s image at [[false sunrise|sunrise]] and [[false sunset|sunset]]]]

'''Atmospheric refraction''' is the deviation of [[light]] or other [[electromagnetic wave]] from a straight line as it passes through the [[atmosphere]] due to the variation in [[air density]] as a function of [[height]].&lt;ref&gt;It is common in studies of refraction to use the term ''height'' to express vertical distance above the ground, or ''[[Geodetic datum#Vertical datum|vertical datum]]'' and ''[[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]]'' to express angular height above the [[horizon]].&lt;/ref&gt; This refraction is due to the velocity of light through [[air]], decreasing (the [[refractive index]] increases) with increased density. Atmospheric [[refraction]] near the ground produces [[mirage]]s. Such refraction can also [[looming and similar refraction phenomena|raise or lower]], or stretch or shorten, the images of distant objects without involving mirages. [[turbulence|Turbulent]] air can make distant objects appear to [[twinkling|twinkle or shimmer]]. The term also applies to the [[refraction of sound]]. Atmospheric refraction is considered in measuring the position of both celestial and terrestrial objects.

Astronomical or celestial refraction causes [[astronomical object]]s to appear higher above the horizon than they actually are. Terrestrial refraction usually causes terrestrial objects to [[Mirage#Superior mirage|appear higher]] than they actually are, although in the afternoon when the air near the ground is heated, the rays can curve upward making objects [[Mirage#Inferior mirage|appear lower]] than they actually are.

Refraction not only affects visible light rays, but all [[electromagnetic radiation]], although in varying degrees. For example, in the [[visible spectrum]], blue is more affected than red. This may cause astronomical objects to appear [[dispersion (optics)|dispersed]] into a spectrum in high-resolution images.

[[File:The Swimming Moon.jpg|thumb|The atmosphere refracts the image of a [[lunar phase|waxing]] crescent [[Moon]] as it sets into the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Swimming Moon |url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1648a/ |website=www.eso.org |access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Whenever possible, [[astronomer]]s will schedule their observations around the times of [[culmination]], when celestial objects are highest in the sky. Likewise, sailors will not shoot a star below 20° above the horizon. If observations of objects near the horizon cannot be avoided, it is possible to equip an [[optical telescope]] with control systems to compensate for the shift caused by the refraction. If the dispersion is also a problem (in case of broadband high-resolution observations), atmospheric refraction correctors (made from pairs of rotating glass [[prism]]s) can be employed as well.

Since the amount of atmospheric refraction is a function of the [[lapse rate|temperature gradient]], [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[humidity]] (the amount of [[water vapor]], which is especially important at mid-[[infrared]] wavelengths), the amount of effort needed for a successful compensation can be prohibitive. Surveyors, on the other hand, will often schedule their observations in the afternoon, when the magnitude of refraction is minimum.

Atmospheric refraction becomes more severe when temperature gradients are strong, and refraction is not uniform when the atmosphere is heterogeneous, as when [[turbulence]] occurs in the air. This causes suboptimal [[astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions, such as the [[twinkling]] of [[star]]s and various deformations of the [[Sun]]'s apparent shape soon before [[sunset]] or after [[sunrise]].

==Astronomical refraction==

'''Astronomical refraction''' deals with the angular position of celestial bodies, their appearance as a point source, and through differential refraction, the shape of extended bodies such as the Sun and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bomford | first = Guy | title = Geodesy | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1980 | edition = 4 | pages = 282–284 | isbn = 0-19-851946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Values===
Atmospheric refraction of the light from a star is zero in the [[zenith]], less than 1&amp;prime; (one [[arcminute|arc-minute]]) at 45° apparent [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]], and still only 5.3&amp;prime; at 10° altitude; it quickly increases as altitude decreases, reaching 9.9′ at 5° altitude, 18.4′ at 2° altitude, and 35.4′ at the [[horizon]];&lt;ref name=Allen1976 /&gt; all values are for 10&amp;nbsp;°C and 1013.25&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|hPa]]
in the visible part of the spectrum.

On the horizon refraction is slightly greater than the apparent diameter of the Sun, so when the bottom of the sun's disc appears to touch the horizon, the sun's true altitude is negative. If the atmosphere suddenly vanished at this moment, one couldn't see the sun, as it would be entirely below the horizon. By convention, [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]] refer to times at which the Sun’s upper limb appears on or disappears from the horizon and the standard value for the Sun’s true altitude is &amp;minus;50&amp;prime;: &amp;minus;34&amp;prime; for the refraction and &amp;minus;16&amp;prime; for the Sun’s [[semidiameter|semi-diameter]]. The altitude of a celestial body is normally given for the center of the body’s disc. In the case of the [[Moon]], additional corrections are needed for the Moon’s [[Parallax#Lunar parallax|horizontal parallax]] and its apparent semi-diameter; both vary with the Earth–Moon distance.

Refraction near the horizon is highly variable, principally because of the variability of the [[lapse rate|temperature gradient]] near the Earth's surface and the geometric sensitivity of the nearly horizontal rays to this variability. As early as 1830, [[Friedrich Bessel]] had found that even after applying all corrections for temperature and pressure (but not for the temperature gradient) at the observer, highly precise measurements of refraction varied by ±0.19&amp;prime; at two degrees above the horizon and by ±0.50&amp;prime; at a half degree above the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fletcher | first = Alan | date = 1952 | title = Astronomical Refraction at Low Altitudes in Marine Navigation | journal = Navigation | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | publisher = The Institute of Navigation | place = London | pages = 314–315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At and below the horizon, values of refraction significantly higher than the nominal value of 35.4′ have been observed in a wide range of climates. Georg Constantin Bouris measured refraction of as much of 4° for stars on the horizon at the [[National Observatory of Athens|Athens Observatory]]&lt;ref name = Young2004/&gt; and, during his ill-fated [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Endurance expedition]], [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]] recorded refraction of 2°37&amp;prime;:&lt;ref name=Shackleton1919 /&gt;

“The sun which had made ‘positively his last appearance’ seven days earlier surprised us by lifting more than half its disk above the horizon on May 8. A glow on the northern horizon resolved itself into the sun at 11 am that day. A quarter of an hour later the unreasonable visitor disappeared again, only to rise again at 11:40 am, set at 1 pm, rise at 1:10 pm and set lingeringly at 1:20 pm. These curious phenomena were due to refraction which amounted to 2° 37′ at 1:20 pm. The temperature was 15° below 0° Fahr., and we calculated that the refraction was 2° above normal.”

Day-to-day variations in the weather will affect the exact times of sunrise and sunset&lt;ref name=SchaeferLiller1990 /&gt; as well as moon-rise and moon-set, and for that reason it generally is not meaningful to give rise and set times to greater precision than the nearest minute.&lt;ref name=Meeus1991 /&gt; More precise calculations can be useful for determining day-to-day changes in rise and set times that would occur with the standard value for refraction{{refn|group=note|For an example see Meeus 2002&lt;ref name=Meeus2002 /&gt;}} if it is understood that actual changes may differ because of unpredictable variations in refraction.

Because atmospheric refraction is nominally 34&amp;prime; on the horizon, but only 29&amp;prime; at 0.5° above it, the setting or rising sun seems to be flattened by about 5&amp;prime; (about 1/6 of its apparent diameter).

===Calculating refraction===

Young&lt;ref name = Young2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Young2006 /&gt; distinguished several regions where different methods for calculating astronomical refraction were applicable. In the upper portion of the sky, with a [[zenith distance]] of less than 70° (or an altitude over 20°), various simple refraction formulas based on the index of refraction (and hence on the temperature, pressure, and humidity) at the observer are adequate. Between 20° and 5° of the horizon the temperature gradient becomes the dominant factor and numerical integration, using a method such as that of Auer and Standish&lt;ref name=AuerStandish2000 /&gt; and employing the [[lapse rate|temperature gradient]] of the [[International Standard Atmosphere|standard atmosphere]] and the measured conditions at the observer, is required. Closer to the horizon, actual measurements of the changes with height of the local temperature gradient need to be employed in the numerical integration. Below the astronomical horizon, refraction is so variable that only crude estimates of astronomical refraction can be made; for example, the observed time of sunrise or sunset can vary by several minutes from day to day. As ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]'' notes, "the actual values of …the refraction at low altitudes may, in extreme atmospheric conditions, differ considerably from the mean values used in the tables."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 1986 | title = The nautical almanac for the year 1988 | publisher = United States Naval Observatory / Her Majesty's Stationery Office | place = Washington / London | page = 261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BennettAtmRefractVsAlt.png|thumb|right|Plot of refraction vs. altitude using Bennett’s 1982 formula]]

Many different formulas have been developed for calculating astronomical refraction; they are reasonably consistent, differing among themselves by a few minutes of arc at the horizon and becoming increasingly consistent as they approach the zenith. The simpler formulations involved nothing more than the temperature and pressure at the observer, powers of the [[cotangent]] of the ''apparent'' altitude of the astronomical body and in the higher order terms, the height of a fictional homogeneous atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fletcher | first = A. | date = 1952 | title = Astronomical Refraction at Low Altitudes in Marine Navigation | journal = The Journal of Navigation | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | publisher = Royal Institute of Navigation | place = London | pages = 307–330 | issn = 1469-7785 | doi = 10.1017/S0373463300045033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wittmann | first = A.

M. | author-link = William Marshall Smart | title = Text-Book on Spherical Astronomy | year = 1977 | edition=sixth | pages = 61–62 | isbn = 0-521-29180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = W&amp;C&gt;{{Citation | last = Woolard | first = Edgar W. | author-link = Edgar W.

Clemence | date = 1966 | title = Spherical Astronomy | publisher = Academic Press | place = New York and London | pages = 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R = (n_0 - 1) \cot h_\mathrm{a} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the refraction in [[radians]], ''n''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[index of refraction]] at the observer (which depends on the temperature and pressure), and ''h&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''apparent'' altitude of the astronomical body.

An early simple approximation of this form, which directly incorporated the temperature and pressure at the observer, was developed by [[George Comstock (astronomer)|George Comstock]]:&lt;ref name = Comstock1890&gt;{{citation | last=Comstock | first=George C.  | title= A Simple Approximate Formula for Refraction | volume = 9 | journal = Sidereal Messenger | date=1890 | page = 186 | bibcode = 1890SidM....9..185. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac {21.5 b} {273 + t} \cot h_\mathrm{a} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the refraction in seconds of arc, ''b'' is the barometric pressure in [[millimeters of mercury]], and ''t'' is the [[Celsius]] temperature. Comstock considered that this formula gave results within one arcsecond of [[Friedrich Bessel|Bessel]]'s values for refraction from 15° above the horizon to the zenith.&lt;ref name = Comstock1890 /&gt;

A further expansion in terms of the third power of the cotangent of the apparent altitude incorporates ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the height of the homogenous atmosphere, in addition to the usual conditions at the observer:&lt;ref name = W&amp;C/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R = (n_0 - 1)(1 -H_0) \cot h_\mathrm{a} - (n_0 - 1)[H_0 - \frac{1}{2}(n_0 - 1)]\cot^3h_\mathrm{a} .&lt;/math&gt;

A version of this formula is used in the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s ''Standards of Fundamental Astronomy''; a comparison of the IAU's algorithm with more rigorous ray-tracing procedures indicated an agreement within 60 [[Minute and second of arc|milliarcseconds]] at altitudes above 15°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 2014 | title = Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy; SOFA Astrometry Tools | edition = Software version 11; Document 1.6 | publisher = International Astronomical Union | pages = 12, 71–73 | url = http://www.iausofa.org/sofa_ast_f.pdf | accessdate = 23 June 2016 | quote = The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for refraction, which use a simple A tan ζ + B tan&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ζ model.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett&lt;ref name=Bennett1982 /&gt; developed another simple empirical formula for calculating refraction from the apparent altitude which gives the refraction ''R'' in arcminutes:

:&lt;math&gt;R = \cot \left ( h_\mathrm{a} + \frac {7.31} {h_\mathrm{a} + 4.4} \right ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is used in the [[United States Naval Observatory|U. S. Naval Observatory]]'s ''Vector Astrometry Software'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kaplan | first = G.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; more complex algorithm within 0.07′ over the entire range from the zenith to the horizon.&lt;ref name=Meeus1991 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett1982/&gt; Sæmundsson&lt;ref name=Saemundsson1986 /&gt; developed an inverse formula for determining refraction from ''true'' altitude; if ''h'' is the true altitude in degrees, refraction ''R'' in arcminutes is given by

:&lt;math&gt;R = 1.02 \cot \left ( h + \frac {10.3} {h + 5.11} \right ) \,;&lt;/math&gt;

the formula is consistent with Bennett’s to within 0.1′. The formulas of Bennet and Sæmundsson assume an [[atmospheric pressure]] of 101.0&amp;nbsp;kPa and a temperature of 10&amp;nbsp;°C; for different pressure ''P'' and temperature ''T'', refraction calculated from these formulas is multiplied by&lt;ref name=Meeus1991 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {P} {101} \, \frac {283} {273 + T} &lt;/math&gt;

Refraction increases approximately 1% for every 0.9&amp;nbsp;kPa increase in pressure, and decreases approximately 1% for every 0.9&amp;nbsp;kPa decrease in pressure. Similarly, refraction increases approximately 1% for every 3&amp;nbsp;°C decrease in temperature, and decreases approximately 1% for every 3&amp;nbsp;°C increase in temperature.

===Random refraction effects===
[[File:Seeing Moon.gif|frame|right|The animated image of the [[Moon]]'s surface shows the [[twinkling|effects]] of atmospheric [[turbulence]] on the view.]]

[[Turbulence]] in [[Earth's atmosphere]] [[light scattering|scatters]] the light from stars, making them appear brighter and fainter on a time-scale of [[millisecond]]s. The slowest components of these fluctuations are visible as [[twinkling]] (also called ''scintillation'').

Turbulence also causes small, sporadic motions of the star image, and produces rapid distortions in its structure. These effects are not visible to the [[naked eye]], but can be easily seen even in small telescopes. They perturb [[astronomical seeing]] conditions.

==Terrestrial refraction==

'''Terrestrial refraction''', sometimes called '''geodetic refraction''', deals with the apparent angular position and measured distance of terrestrial bodies. It is of special concern for the production of precise [[Cartography|maps]] and [[Surveying|surveys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bomford | first = Guy | title = Geodesy | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1980 | edition = 4 | pages = 42–48, 233–243 | isbn = 0-19-851946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the line of sight in terrestrial refraction passes near the earth's surface, the magnitude of refraction depends chiefly on the temperature gradient near the ground, which varies widely at different times of day, seasons of the year, the nature of the terrain, the state of the weather, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Woolard | first = Edgar W. | author-link = Edgar W. Woolard | last2 = Clemence | first2 = Gerald M. | author2-link = Gerald M. Clemence | date = 1966 | title = Spherical Astronomy | publisher = Academic Press | place = New York and London | page = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a common approximation, terrestrial refraction is considered as a constant bending of the ray of light or line of sight, in which the ray can be considered as describing a circular path. A common measure of refraction is the coefficient of refraction. Unfortunately there are two different definitions of this coefficient. One is the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight,&lt;ref name=Hirt2010&gt;{{Citation | last = Hirt | first = Christian | last2 = Guillaume | first2 = Sebastian | last3 = Wisbar | first3 = Annemarie | last4 = Bürki | first4 = Beat | last5 = Sternberg | first5 = Harald | date = 2010 | title = Monitoring of the refraction coefficient in the lower atmosphere using a controlled setup of simultaneous reciprocal vertical angle measurements | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 115 | publisher = American Geophysical Union | pages = D21102 | doi = 10.1029/2010JD014067|bibcode = 2010JGRD..11521102H }}&lt;/ref&gt; the other is the ratio of the angle that the line of sight subtends at the center of the Earth to the angle of refraction measured at the observer.&lt;ref name=Bomford1980_236&gt;{{Citation | last = Bomford | first = Guy | title = Geodesy | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1980 | edition = 4 | page = 236 | isbn = 0-19-851946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the latter definition only measures the bending of the ray at one end of the line of sight, it is one half the value of the former definition.

The coefficient of refraction is directly related to the local vertical temperature gradient and the atmospheric temperature and pressure. The larger version of the coefficient ''k'', measuring the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight, is given by:&lt;ref name=Hirt2010/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k =  503 \frac{P} {T^2} \left ( 0.0343 + \frac {dT} {dh} \right ), &lt;/math&gt;

where temperature ''T'' is given in [[kelvin]]s, pressure ''P'' in [[Bar (unit)|millibars]], and height ''h'' in meters. The angle of refraction increases with the coefficient of refraction and with the length of the line of sight.

Although the straight line from your eye to a distant mountain might be blocked by a closer hill, the ray may curve enough to make the distant peak visible. A convenient method to analyze the effect of refraction on visibility is to consider an increased effective radius of the Earth ''R&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;'', given by&lt;ref name=Young2006/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{eff} = \frac {R} {1 - k} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the radius of the Earth and ''k'' is the coefficient of refraction. Under this model the ray can be considered a straight line on an Earth of increased radius.

The curvature of the refracted ray in [[arc seconds]] per meter can be computed using the relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bomford | first = Guy | title = Geodesy | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1980 | edition = 4 | page = 235 | isbn = 0-19-851946-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {\sigma} =  16.3 \frac{P} {T^2} \left ( 0.0342 + \frac {dT} {dh} \right ) \cos \beta&lt;/math&gt;

where 1/σ is the curvature of the ray in arcsec per meter, ''P'' is the pressure in millibars, ''T'' is the temperature in kelvins, and β is the angle of the ray to the horizontal. Multiplying half the curvature by the length of the ray path gives the angle of refraction at the observer. For a line of sight near the horizon cos β differs little from unity and can be ignored. This yields

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega = 8.15 \frac{L P} {T^2} \left ( 0.0342 + \frac {dT} {dh} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the length of the line of sight in meters and Ω is the refraction at the observer measured in arc seconds.

A simple approximation is to consider that a mountain's apparent altitude at your eye (in degrees) will exceed its true altitude by its distance in kilometers divided by 1500. This assumes a fairly horizontal line of sight and ordinary air density; if the mountain is very high (so much of the sightline is in thinner air) divide by 1600 instead.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

[[File:American_River_16792.JPG|thumb|Gravel bar in the [[American River (Washington)|American River]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], United States.]]

A '''bar''' in a [[river]] is an elevated region of [[sediment]] (such as [[sand]] or [[gravel]]) that has been [[deposition (geology)|deposited]] by the flow. Types of bars include [[mid-channel bar]]s (also called [[braid bar]]s, and common in [[braided river]]s), [[point bar]]s (common in [[Meander|meandering rivers]]), and [[mouth bar]]s (common in [[river delta]]s). The locations of bars are determined by the geometry of the river and the flow through it. Bars reflect sediment supply conditions, and can show where sediment supply rate is greater than the transport capacity.

A mid-channel bar, is also often referred to as a braid bar because they are often found in braided river channels. Braided river channels are broad and shallow and found in areas where sediment is easily [[Erosion|eroded]] like at a [[Outwash plain|glacial outwash]], or at a mountain front with high sediment loads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Key Concepts in Geomorphology|last=Bierman and Montgomery|first=|publisher=Freeman and co. publishing|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/copper_river/background/data/Wooster-braided.pdf|title=A Braided River System in a Glacial Environment, the Copper River, Alaska|last=Wooster|first=John|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of river systems are associated with high [[slope]], sediment supply, [[stream power]], [[shear stress]], and bed load transport rates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Braided rivers have complex and unpredictable channel patterns, and sediment size tends to vary among streams.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuurman|first1=Filip|last2=Marra|first2=Wouter A.|last3=Kleinhans|first3=Maarten G.|title=Physics-based modeling of large braided sand-bed rivers: Bar pattern formation, dynamics, and sensitivity|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|date=2013|volume=118|issue=4|pages=2509–2527|doi=10.1002/2013JF002896}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is these features that are responsible for the formations of braid bars. Braided streams are often overfed with massive amounts of sediment which creates multiple stream channels within one dominant pair of flood bank plains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These channels are separated by mid-channel or braid bars. [[Anastomosis|Anastomosing]] river channels also create mid-channel bars, however they are typically vegetated bars, making them more permanent than the bars found in a braided river channel which have high rates of change because of the large amounts of non-cohesive sediment, lack of vegetation, and high stream powers found in braided river channels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bars can also form mid-channel due to snags or [[Log jam|logjams]]. For example, if a stable log is deposited mid-channel in a stream, this obstructs the flow and creates local flow [[Convergence of random variables|convergence]] and [[divergence]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This causes erosion on the upstream side of the obstruction and deposition on the downstream side. The deposition that occurs on the downstream side can create a central bar, and an arcuate bar can be formed as flow diverges upstream of the obstruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Continuous deposition downstream can build up the central bar to form an [[island]]. Eventually the logjam can become partially buried, which protects the island from erosion, allowing for vegetation to begin to grow, and stabilize the area even further. Over time, the bar can eventually attach to one side of the channel [[Bank (river)|bank]] and merge into the [[Floodplain|flood plain]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A point bar is an area of deposition typically found in meandering rivers. Point bars form on the inside of meander bends in meandering rivers. As the flow moves around the inside of the bend in the river, the water slows down because of the shallow flow and low shear stresses there reduce the amount of material that can be carried there. Point bars are usually crescent shaped and located on the inside curve of the river bend.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5KY01_thalwegs-point-bars-cut-banks-oh-my|title=Thalwegs, Point Bars, &amp; Cut Banks (Oh my!)|last=foxult|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excess material falls out of transport and, over time, forms a point bar. Point bars are typically found in the slowest moving, shallowest parts of rivers and [[streams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing Physical Geography|last=Strahler|first=Alan|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|year=1996|isbn=0-471-13569-0|location=USA|pages=430, 529|author2=Strahler, Arthur}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often parallel to the shore and occupy the area farthest from the [[thalweg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Process Geomorphology|last=Ritter|first=Dale F.|publisher=W.

Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the outside curve of the river bend in a meandering river. Here, at the deepest and fastest part of the stream is the [[cut bank]], the area of a meandering river channel that continuously undergoes erosion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The faster the water in a river channel, the better it is able to pick up greater amounts of sediment, and larger pieces of sediment, which increases the river’s [[bed load]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Over a long enough period of time, the combination of deposition along point bars, and erosion along cut banks can lead to the formation of an [[oxbow lake]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A mouth bar is an elevated region of sediment typically found at a [[river delta]] which is located at the [[River mouth|mouth of a river]] where the river flows out to the ocean. Sediment is transported by the river and deposited, mid channel, at the mouth of the river. This occurs because, as the river widens at the mouth, the flow slows, and sediment settles out and is deposited.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edmonds|first1=D. A.|last2=Slingerland|first2=R.

This pressure creates erosion on that face of the bar, allowing the flow to transport this sediment over or around, and re-deposit it farther downstream, closer to the ocean.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; River mouth bars stagnate, or cease to prograde when the water depth above the flow is shallow enough to create a pressure on the upstream side of the bar strong enough to force the flow around the deposit rather than over the top of the bar.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This divergent channel flow around either side of the sediment deposit continuously transports sediment, which over time is deposited on either side of this original mid channel deposit. As more and more sediment accumulates across the mouth of the river, it builds up to eventually create a sand bar that has the potential to extend the entire length of the river mouth and block the flow.

[[File:DelphiSpringRoman.JPG|thumb|Castalian Spring]]
[[File:Castalian spring at Delphi; the cavities in the rock are for Wellcome V0020100.jpg|thumb|Print from [[Frederick Rudolph Hay]] etching of [[Edward Daniel Clarke]]'s ''Castalian spring at Delphi'']]
The '''Castalian Spring''', in the [[ravine]] between the [[Phaedriades]] at [[Delphi]], is where all visitors to Delphi &amp;mdash; the contestants in the [[Pythian Games]], and especially pilgrims who came to consult the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] &amp;mdash; stopped to wash themselves and quench their thirst; it is also here that the Pythia and the priests cleansed themselves before the oracle-giving process. Finally Roman poets regarded it as a source of poetic inspiration. According to some mythological versions it was here that [[Apollo]] killed the monster, [[Python (mythology)|Python]], who was guarding the spring, and that is why it was considered to be sacred.

==The Archaic fountain==

Two [[fountain]]s, which were fed by the sacred [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]], still survive. The archaic 6th century [[BCE]] fountain house has a [[marble]]-lined basin surrounded by benches. Water was brought here by means of a short and small aqueduct and was distributed by a system of water pipes ending in lion-headed spouts. &lt;ref&gt;Amandry, P., Notes  de topographie et d' architecture  Delphiques: VI: la fontaine  de Castalie, BCH, Suppl.4, 1977, 179-228&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Roman fountain==
The Roman fountain dates to the 1st century B.C. and is situated about 50 meters higher from the Archaic one. Niches carved on the rock were  intended for the [[Ex-voto|ex votos]] of the pilgrims. One of them was later transformed into a church of St. John the Baptist. The water of  the spring reached the fountain with a closed aqueduct. On the facade of the fountain there were seven bronze spouts. In front of it there was a paved courtyard with stone benches on its three sides.  &lt;ref&gt;Amandry, P., Notes  de topographie et d' architecture  Delphiques: VI: la fontaine  de Castalie, BCH, Suppl.4, 1977, 179-228&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Bommelaer, J.-F., Laroche, D., Guide de Delphes. Le site, Sites et Monuments 7, Paris  1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and other uses==
Nowadays a modern fountain stands close to  the street leading to the archaeological site of Delphi to offer respite to the travelers.
The Castalian Spring fuelled poetic inspiration, albeit often confused with the [[Spring of Pieris]]. The [[Castalian Band]], a group of poets or [[makars]] associated with the Court of [[James VI]] of [[Scotland]] (including the king himself) drew their name from this source.

There is a town named [[Castalian Springs, Tennessee|Castalian Springs]] in [[Tennessee]]. A natural spring in this location was a gathering place for animals. Isaac Bledsoe discovered the spring in 1772. Having built a fort in 1783, Bledsoe, his brother, and their families settled near the spring in 1787. Native Americans killed the two brothers, who are now buried 500 yards northwest of the spring. Consequently, this area was known locally as Bledsoe's Lick. In 1828, a log inn was built, providing guests with "healthy" drinking water and mineral baths. Almost ten years later when the post office was built, the community changed its name from Bledsoe's Lick to Castalian Springs. During this period of time in history, there was a reawakening of interest in classical Greece and Rome.

In [[Castalia, Ohio]], named after the famed site, the Blue Hole limestone configurations were tourist attractions for many years and are now fish hatcheries. Waters in the blue holes are of a constant temperature and never freeze over despite northern Ohio's cold temperatures. The water which averages 30,000 gallons an hour was first used to supply a local mill.

Castalian Springs was the name of a now-abandoned spa near [[Durant, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Mary Carol, Mary Rose Carter, and Greg Iles, ''Must See Mississippi: 50 Favorite Places''. Univ. Press of Mississippi. 155-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clean Cities''' is a government-industry partnership in the United States that provides regional coalitions with information and incentives from the [[United States Department of Energy]] (USDOE), a large collection of technical data and resources, and coordinated strategies and resources they can leverage to obtain maximum petroleum reduction. The Clean Cities partnership consists of 87 coalitions that work with 5,700 local stakeholder programs that have helped avoid the usage of over {{convert|2|e9USgal|m3}} of petroleum, put more than 500,000 AFVs on the road, and played a role in the construction of over 3,000 alternative refueling stations since 1993.

== India ==
The country India contains two designated Clean Cities coalitions: KAKINADA, ATCHAMPETA and Central Indiana Clean Cities. South Shore Clean Cities serves all of Northern Indiana which includes the following 18 counties: Benton, DeKalb, Elkhart, Fulton, Jasper, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Lake, LaPorte, Marshall, Newton, Noble, Porter, Pulaski, St. Joseph, Starke, Steuben and Whitley.

Chartered on June 15, 1999, South Shore Clean Cities is a government/industry partnership designed to help reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector. Located in an area that has suffered the devastating environmental impact of the industrial practices of the late 19th through the mid 20th centuries, South Shore Clean Cities is dedicated to preserving and revitalizing Northern Indiana by promoting the use of clean fuels and clean vehicles technology.

== Maryland ==

The Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority. Better known as simply "Metro," the authority provides transit services to the metropolitan area in and around Washington, D.C. The authority has a fleet of 1,500 buses, including 74 [[hybrid electric bus]]es and Metro plans to have nearly 500 more hybrid-electric buses by 2012. Vice  Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, who last year committed to convert the entire Maryland Transit Administration bus fleet to hybrid-electric buses by 2014. Maryland has already accelerated its purchase of hybrid-electric buses with the help of Recovery Act funds (Clean Cities).&lt;ref name=EERE /&gt;

== Tennessee ==
The State of Tennessee contains 2 designated Clean Cities coalitions: the East Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition (http://www.ETCleanFuels.org/), and Middle Tennessee Clean Fuels (http://middletncleanfuels.org/). Both were designated in 2004. A third coalition—-West Tennessee Clean Fuels—-is forming (http://www.cfwt.tn.org). Many fleets in Tennessee use alternative fuels like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Eastman Chemical Company, UPS, Waste Management, cities like Sevierville, Kingsport, Memphis and Crossville, and the Tennessee Dept. of Transportation (a significant biodiesel user in the state). As of 2012, Tennessee has about 30 public stations where E85 is available, and the same where B5, B20 or higher blends like B99 are available. Tennessee's first public CNG station opened in Wartburg, Tennessee in late 2010, and another 5 stations have opened Memphis, Nashville, Huntsville, Athens and Sevierville. As of October 2014, 4 more are expected to be completed in 2015.

The East Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition holds quarterly coalition meetings in Knoxville on the first Thursday of February, May, August and November. See the Website for meeting information. http://www.ETCleanFuels.org/

== Wisconsin ==
The State of Wisconsin has one Clean City coalition designated in 1994 called Wisconsin Clean Cities (http://www.wicleancities.org/). Serving the entire state of Wisconsin, WCC has provided education and outreach regarding alternative fuels, vehicles, infrastructure, fuel efficiency improvements and idle reduction. WCC has been instrumental in securing federal and state funding to implement many projects across the state of Wisconsin. Since 2010 WCC has participated in hundreds of events and public engagements statewide. In 2013, WCC reported a reduction of nearly  12 million in gasoline gallon equivalents due to the increase of alternative fuels and technologies. WCC also reported a greenhouse gas emission reduction at 57.9 tons in 2012, a 99% increase from the previous year.

== Empire Clean Cities ==
Empire Clean Cities is the Clean Cities coalition for New York City &amp; the Lower Hudson Valley (Westchester, Rockland, &amp; Putnam Counties).  ECC was incorporated in 2007 and was formerly known as New York City &amp; Lower Hudson Valley Clean Cities.  ECC has been tasked with providing support and management skills necessary to advance the regions economic, environmental, and energy security by building local public-private partnerships towards promoting the use of technologies and practices that reduce petroleum consumption.  In 2012 ECC introduced Empire Green Fleets a metric used to evaluate the overall impact of public and private fleets operating in the region.  ECC also launched a Green Food Trucks initiative in 2012.  With the popularity of food trucks in NYC growing ECC conducted an investigation on the feasibility of promoting the use of biodiesel in these trucks.  http://www.empirecleancities.org/

== American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ==
On 2009 [[Earth Day]], Vice President [[Joe Biden]] announced the availability of $300&amp;nbsp;million in funding from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] for state and local governments and [[transit authority|transit authorities]] to expand the nation's fleet of clean, sustainable vehicles and the fueling infrastructure necessary to support them. The Clean Cities Alternative Fuel and Advanced Technology Vehicles Pilot Program will support at least 30 projects involving alternative fuels or advanced vehicles. Technologies eligible to be funded include a number of different light- and heavy-duty vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric, hydraulic hybrid, electric, fuel cell, and compressed natural gas vehicles. In addition, projects can support refueling infrastructure for alternative fuels, including biofuels and natural gas. Other efforts eligible for funds include public awareness campaigns and training programs on alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles and infrastructure. The program requires a 50% cost share from participants.&lt;ref name=EERE&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12476 DOE Offers $300 Million in Recovery Act Funds for Clean Cities Program]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy News, April 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Southeast Propane Autogas Development Program''' is the largest Clean Cities alternative fuel vehicle conversion deployment program in history. The Program is administered by Virginia Clean Cities at James Madison University and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy. The Program is converting fleet vehicles from gasoline to [[autogas]] in the Southeastern United States. The project received an $8.6 million grant from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

== Criticism ==
While Clean Cities includes a scattering of funding for electrification and charging stations, most of it is for carbon-based liquid fuels or non-[[pluggable hybrid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1072.html The Ultimate Posting on Plug-In Hybrid Developments: Clip &amp; Save]. CalCars, September 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Clean Cities federal funding in 2010-2011 was set up with a majority of the funding favoring plug-in EVs and HEVs. However, the amount of funding and focus of that funding ebbs and flows between the alternative fuels over time due to advances in technology and interest in those fuels. CNG and propane were more popular in the early 2000s, the biofuels ethanol and biodiesel took center stage in the mid 2000s, and electric vehicles have taken the limelight most recently (2010–2011).

'''Energy density''' is the amount of [[energy]] stored in a given system or region of space per unit [[volume]]. Colloquially it may also be used for energy per unit [[mass]], though the accurate term for this is [[specific energy]].  Often only the ''useful'' or extractable energy is measured, which is to say that inaccessible energy (such as [[rest mass]] energy) is ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec04.html |title=The Two Classes of SI Units and the SI Prefixes |work=NIST Guide to the SI |publisher= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] and other [[general relativity|general relativistic]] contexts, however, the energy densities considered are those that correspond to the elements of the [[stress–energy tensor]] and therefore do include mass energy as well as energy densities associated with the pressures described in the next paragraph.

Energy per unit volume has the same physical units as [[pressure]], and in many circumstances is a [[synonym]]: for example, the energy density of a magnetic field may be expressed as (and behaves as) a physical pressure, and the energy required to compress a compressed gas a little more may be determined by multiplying the difference between the gas pressure and the external pressure by the change in volume. In short, pressure is a measure of the [[enthalpy]] per unit volume of a system. A pressure gradient has the potential to perform work on the surroundings by converting enthalpy to work until equilibrium is reached.

==Introduction to energy density==
&lt;!-- This section in intended for learners, and therefore covers only common materials, and omits excessive detail --&gt;

There are many different types of energy stored in materials, and it takes a particular type of reaction to release each type of energy. In order of the typical magnitude of the energy released, these types of reactions are: nuclear, chemical, electrochemical, and electrical.

[[Nuclear reaction]]s are used by stars and nuclear power plants, both of which derive energy from the binding energy of nuclei. [[Chemical reaction]]s are used by animals to derive energy from food, and by automobiles to derive energy from gasoline. Liquid hydrocarbons (fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerozene) are today the most dense way known to economically store and  transport chemical energy at a very large scale (1 kg of diesel fuel burns with the oxygen contained in ~15 kg of air). [[Electrochemical reaction]]s are used by most mobile devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones to release the energy from batteries.

===Energy densities of common energy storage materials===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!-- STOP!!! This section is for a basic overview comparison of common energy storage materials. Before adding any items, first ask yourself: Is this material used on a large scale to produce energy, or is it commonly discussed in everyday journalism? If so, go ahead and add it! --&gt;

The following is a list of the thermal energy densities (that is to say: the amount of heat energy that can be extracted) of commonly used or well-known energy storage materials; it doesn't include uncommon or experimental materials. Note that this list does not consider the mass of reactants commonly available such as the oxygen required for combustion or the energy efficiency in use. An extended version of this table is found at [[Energy density#Extended Reference Table]]. Major reference = &lt;ref name="engineeringtoolbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fossil-fuels-energy-content-d_1298.html |title=Fossil and Alternative Fuels - Energy Content (2008).  |publisher=Engineering ToolBox |accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The following unit conversions may be helpful when considering the data in the table: 3.6&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|MJ]] = 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] ≈ 1.34&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower-hour|HPh]].

==Energy density in energy storage and in fuel==
[[File:Energy density.svg|thumb|400px|Selected energy densities plot&lt;ref name=tzar1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=tzar8 /&gt;]]

In [[energy storage]] applications the energy density relates the [[mass]] of an energy store to the volume of the storage facility, e.g. the [[fuel]] tank. The higher the energy density of the fuel, the more energy may be stored or transported for the same amount of volume. The energy density of a fuel per unit mass is called the [[specific energy]] of that fuel. In general an [[engine]] using that fuel will generate less [[kinetic energy]] due to [[inefficiency|inefficiencies]] and [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] considerations—hence the [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] of an engine will always be greater than its rate of production of the kinetic energy of motion.

===Nuclear energy sources===&lt;!--esoterica to most readers--&gt;
The greatest energy source by far is mass itself.  This energy, ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''m = ρV'', ''ρ'' is the mass per unit volume, ''V'' is the volume of the mass itself and ''c'' is the speed of light.  This energy, however, can be released only by the processes of [[nuclear fission]] (0.1%), [[nuclear fusion]] (1%), or the annihilation of some or all of the matter in the volume ''V'' by matter-[[antimatter]] collisions (100%).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Nuclear reactions cannot be realized by chemical reactions such as combustion.  Although greater matter densities can be achieved, the density of a [[neutron star]] would approximate the most dense system capable of matter-antimatter annihilation possible.  A [[black hole]], although denser than a neutron star, does not have an equivalent anti-particle form, but would offer the same 100% conversion rate of mass to energy in the form of Hawking radiation. In the case of relatively small black holes (smaller than astronomical objects) the power output would be tremendous.

The highest density sources of energy aside from antimatter are [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]. Fusion includes energy from the sun which will be available for billions of years (in the form of sunlight) but so far (2018), sustained [[fusion power]] production continues to be elusive. 

Power from fission of uranium and thorium in [[nuclear power]] plants will be available for many decades or even centuries because of the plentiful supply of the elements on earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Uranium-Resources/Supply-of-Uranium/ |title=Supply of Uranium |publisher=world-nuclear.org |date=2014-10-08 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the full potential of this source can only be realised through [[breeder reactor]]s, which are, apart from the [[BN-600 reactor]], not yet used commercially.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/cohen.html |title=Facts from Cohen |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal]], [[gas]], and [[petroleum]] are the current primary energy sources in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506022627/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/pecss_diagram.html|archivedate=2010-05-06 |title=U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - Annual Energy Review |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have a much lower energy density. Burning local [[biomass]] fuels supplies household energy needs ([[Biomass Cook Stoves|cooking fires]], [[oil lamp]]s, etc.) worldwide. 

====Thermal power of nuclear fission reactors====
The density of thermal energy contained in the core of a [[light water reactor]] ([[Pressurized water reactor|PWR]] or [[Boiling water reactor|BWR]]) of typically 1 GWe (1 000 MW electrical corresponding to ~3 000 MW thermal) is in the range of 10 to 100 MW of thermal energy per cubic meter of cooling water depending on the location considered in the system (the core itself (~30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the reactor pressure vessel (~50 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or the whole primary circuit (~300 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)). This represents a considerable density of energy which requires under all circumstances a continuous water flow at high velocity in order to be able to remove the [[heat]] from the core, even after an emergency shutdown of the reactor. The incapacity to cool the cores of three [[boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) at [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] in 2011 after the [[tsunami]] and the resulting loss of the external electrical power and of the cold source was the cause of the meltdown of the three cores in only a few hours. Meanwhile, the three reactors were correctly shut down just after the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake]]. This extremely high power density distinguishes nuclear power plants (NPP's) from any thermal power plants (burning coal, fuel or gas) or any chemical plants and explains the large redundancy required to permanently control the [[Nuclear chain reaction|neutron reactivity]] and to remove the residual heat from the core of NPP's.

===Broad implications===
Energy density differs from [[energy conversion efficiency]] (net output per input) or [[embodied energy]] (the energy output costs to provide, as [[energy industry|harvesting]], [[Oil refinery|refining]], distributing, and dealing with [[pollution]] all use energy). Large scale, intensive energy use impacts and is impacted by [[climate]], [[nuclear waste|waste storage]], and [[deforestation|environmental consequences]].

No single energy storage method boasts the best in [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]], [[specific energy]], and energy density. [[Peukert's Law]] describes how the amount of useful energy that can be obtained (for a lead-acid cell) depends on how quickly we pull it out.  To maximize both specific energy and energy density, one can compute the [[specific energy|specific energy density]] of a substance by multiplying the two values together, where the higher the number, the better the substance is at storing energy efficiently.

Alternative options are discussed for energy storage to increase energy density and decrease charging time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ionescu-Zanetti|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Nanogap capacitors: Sensitivity to sample permittivity changes|date=2005|volume=99|issue=2|doi=10.1063/1.2161818|bibcode=2006JAP....99b4305I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naoi|first1=K.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=New generation "nanohybrid supercapacitor".|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=2013|doi=10.1021/ar200308h}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubler|first1=A.|last2=Osuagwu|first2=O.|title=Digital quantum batteries: Energy and information storage in nanovacuum tube arrays|journal=Complexity|date=2010|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1002/cplx.20306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyon|first1=D.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Gap size dependence of the dielectric strength in nano vacuum gaps|journal=: IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation|date=2013|volume=2|issue=4|doi=10.1109/TDEI.2013.6571470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gravimetric]] and [[volumetric]] energy density of some fuels and storage technologies (modified from the [[Gasoline]] article):
:Note: Some values may not be precise because of [[isomers]] or other irregularities.  See [[Heating value]] for a comprehensive table of specific energies of important fuels.
:Note: Also it is important to realise that generally the density values for chemical fuels do not include the weight of oxygen required for combustion. This is typically two oxygen atoms per carbon atom, and one per two hydrogen atoms. The [[atomic weight]] of carbon and oxygen are similar, while hydrogen is much lighter than oxygen. Figures are presented this way for those fuels where in practice air would only be drawn in locally to the burner. This explains the apparently lower energy density of materials that already include their own oxidiser (such as gunpowder and TNT), where the mass of the oxidiser in effect adds dead weight, and absorbs some of the energy of combustion to dissociate and liberate oxygen to continue the reaction. This also explains some apparent anomalies, such as the energy density of a sandwich appearing to be higher than that of a stick of dynamite.

===Energy densities ignoring external components===
This table lists energy densities of systems that require external components, such as oxidisers or a heat sink or source. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of the required components as they are assumed to be freely available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems cannot be compared with self-contained systems. These values may not be computed at the same reference conditions.
&lt;!-- To ensure this table sorts correctly: avoid using "-" or unicode dash in columns with numbers; ensure each row has a single numeric value, use data-sort-value="0" |  if unknown; do not use ? or {{?}}; do not use "A to B", nor "C (approximately)"; provide a cite for each value. Test changes on several browsers as sort behaviour may vary. --&gt;

==Energy density of electric and magnetic fields==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Special relativity]] --&gt;
[[Electric field|Electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s store energy.  In a vacuum, the (volumetric) energy density is given by

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{\varepsilon_0}{2} \mathbf{E}^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} \mathbf{B}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]]. The solution will be (in SI units) in Joules per cubic metre. In the context of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], the physics of conductive fluids, the magnetic energy density behaves like an additional [[pressure]] that adds to the [[kinetic theory of gas|gas pressure]] of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]].

In normal (linear and nondispersive) substances, the energy density (in SI units) is

:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{1}{2} ( \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{H} \cdot \mathbf{B} ) &lt;/math&gt;

where '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]] and '''H''' is the [[Effective magnetic field|magnetizing field]].

In the case of absence of magnetic fields, by exploting [[Herbert Fröhlich|Fröhlich's relationships]] it is also possible to extend these equations to [[anisotropic|anisotropy]] and [[nonlinear|nonlinearity]] dielectrics, as well as to calculate the correlated [[Helmholtz free energy]] and [[entropy]] densities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parravicini | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1016/j.physb.2018.04.029 | title = Thermodynamic potentials in anisotropic and nonlinear dielectrics | journal = Physica B | volume = 541 | pages = 54-60 | year = 2018 | bibcode = 2018PhyB..541...54P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2318">In [[electrical engineering]], the '''Ferranti effect''' is an increase in voltage  occurring at the receiving end of a long [[Electric power transmission|transmission line]], above the voltage at the sending end. This occurs when the line is energized, but there is a very light load or the load is disconnected. The capacitive line charging current produces a voltage drop across the line inductance that is in-phase with the sending-end voltage, assuming negligible line resistance. Therefore, both line inductance and capacitance are responsible for this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ku.edu.np/ee/rb/Handouts_COEG301&amp;303/Ferranti+Effect.pdf Ferranti Effect handout, Kathmandu University (internet archive)]{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ferranti Effect will be more pronounced the longer the line and the higher the voltage applied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipst.org/TechPapers/2001/IPST01Paper117.pdf Line-Charging Current Interruption by HV and EHV Circuit Breakers, Carl-Ejnar Sölver, Ph. D. and Sérgio de A. Morais, M.

The Ferranti effect is much more pronounced in underground cables, even in short lengths, because of their high capacitance.

It was first observed during the installation of underground cables in [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]]'s 10,000 volt distribution system in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;J. F.

'''Glacier morphology''', or the form a [[glacier]] takes, is influenced by [[temperature]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[topography]], and other factors.  Types of glaciers range from massive [[ice sheet]]s, such as the [[Greenland ice sheet]] or those in Antarctica, to small [[cirque glacier]]s perched on a mountain.  Glaciers can be grouped into two main categories, based on whether ice flow is constrained by the underlying [[bedrock]] [[topography]].

==Unconstrained==
[[Image:Vatnajökull.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Vatnajökull]] ice cap in [[Iceland]]]]

===Ice sheets and ice caps===
[[Ice sheet]]s and [[ice cap]]s cover vast areas and are unconstrained by the underlying topography having a radial flow. The main distinction between the two is the size of their surface, with ice caps covering areas less than 50,000 square kilometers, while ice sheets span larger areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/views/KCs/Glaciers/HTML/ET_Intro.htm |title=Introduction to Glaciers |publisher=National Park Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903174542/http://www2.nature.nps.gov/views/KCs/Glaciers/HTML/ET_Intro.htm |archivedate=2006-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice sheets and ice caps can be classified further.

===Ice domes===
An [[ice dome]] is an upstanding ice surface located in the [[glacier ice accumulation|accumulation]] zone of the higher altitude portions of an ice cap or ice sheet. Ice domes are nearly symmetrical with a convex or parabolic surface shape. They tend to develop evenly over a land mass that may be either a topographic height or a depression —often reflecting the subglacial topography. In ice sheets, domes may reach a thickness that may exceed 3,000 m, but in ice caps the thickness of the dome is roughly up to several hundred metres. In glaciated islands ice domes are usually the highest point of the ice cap.&lt;ref&gt;Atle Nesje, Svein Olat Dahl, ''Glaciers and Environmental Change''. Rotledge, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of an ice dome is [[Kupol Vostok Pervyy]] in [[Alger Island, Russia|Alger Island]], [[Franz Josef Land]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=9197303&amp;fid=5071&amp;c=russia Kupol Vostok Pervyy: Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ice streams===
[[Ice stream]]s rapidly channel ice flow out to the sea or [[ocean]], where it may feed into an [[ice shelf]].  At the margin between ice and water, [[ice calving]] takes place, with [[iceberg]]s breaking off.  Ice streams are bounded on the sides by areas of slowly moving ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McIntyre, N.F. |year=1985 |title=The Dynamics of Ice Sheet Outlets |journal=Journal of Glaciology |volume=31 |pages=99–107|bibcode = 1985JGlac..31...99M |doi=10.1017/S0022143000006328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constrained==

===Icefield===
[[File:Southern Patagonia Ice Field from ISS.jpg|thumb|220px|Southern Patagonia Ice Field from [[ISS]], astronaut photo. North is to the right.]]

An [[icefield]] covers a relatively large area, usually located in mountainous terrain.  The underlying topography controls or influences the form that an icefield takes.  Often, [[nunatak]]s poke through the surface of icefields.  Examples of icefields include the [[Columbia Icefield]] in the [[Canadian Rockies]] and the [[Northern Patagonian Icefield|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]] in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].

===Outlet glaciers===
'''Outlet glaciers''' are channels of ice that flow out of ice sheets, ice caps or icefields, but are constrained on the sides with exposed bedrock.

===Valley glaciers===
[[File:Grosser Aletschgletscher 3196.JPG|thumb|[[Aletsch Glacier|Grosser Aletschgletscher]],  [[Bernese Alps]], Switzerland]]
[[File:Image_Valley_Glacier.svg|150px|Valley Glacier]]

Valley glaciers can be outlet glaciers that provide drainage for icefields, icecaps or icesheets and they are also constrained by underlying topography.  But they may also form up in mountain ranges as gathering snow turns to ice.  Ice-free exposed bedrock and slopes often surround valley glaciers, providing snow and ice from above to accumulate on the glacier via [[avalanche]]s. True [[fjords]] are formed when valley glaciers retreat and sea water fills the void.

===Piedmont glaciers===
[[File:1024 Nordpolausflug- Nordostgrönland-05052012182.jpg|thumb|Elephant Foot Glacier, a well-known Piedmont glacier in [[Romer Lake]], northeastern [[Greenland]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=85303&amp;src=eoa-iotd Elephant Foot Glacier] at NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Image Piedmont Glacier.svg|150px|Image of a Piedmont Glacier]]

Piedmont glaciers are valley glaciers which have spilled out onto relatively flat plains, where they spread out into bulb-like lobes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/questions/types.html#piedmont What types of glaciers are there? National Snow and Ice Data Center.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Malaspina Glacier]] in Alaska is the largest example of this.

===Cirque glaciers===
[[Image:Lowercurtis.jpg|thumb|right|Lower Curtis Glacier is a cirque glacier in the [[North Cascades]] in the State of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]]]
[[File:Image Cirque Glacier.svg|150px|Image of a Cirque Glacier]]

Snow may be situated on the [[leeward]] slope of a mountain, where it is sheltered and accumulates in small depressions. In these depressions, [[snow]] persists through summer months, and is transformed into [[glacier]] ice. The glaciers which are built up now, the [[cirque glacier]]s form [[cirque (landform)|cirque]]s, bowl-shaped valleys on the side of the mountains.

"Energy Investment Partnerships: How State and Local Governments Are Engaging Private Capital to Drive Clean Energy Investment"&lt;/ref&gt; Green banks seek to reduce energy costs for ratepayers, stimulate private sector investment and economic activity, and expedite the transition to a low-carbon economy.

In the United States, green banks have been created at the state and local levels. The [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], and [[Malaysia]] have all created national banks dedicated to leveraging private investment in clean energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. "Green Investment Banks: Scaling Up Private Investment in Low-Carbon, Climate Resilient Infrastructure&lt;/ref&gt; Together, green banks around the world have driven approximately $30 billion of clean energy investment&lt;ref&gt;http://greenbanknetwork.org/gbn-impact/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
In the US, the green bank concept was originally developed by [[Reed Hundt]] and Ken Berlin, as a part of the 2008 [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|Obama-Biden Transition Team]]’s efforts to facilitate clean energy development.&lt;ref name="CGC Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coalitionforgreencapital.com/about-cgc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407043416/http://www.coalitionforgreencapital.com/about-cgc.html |archivedate=2016-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar concept was adopted as an amendment to the federal [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] bill, called the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]], introduced in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Climate Progress. "What is the Clean Energy Bank and Why Is It In Waxman-Markey?”&lt;/ref&gt;  A companion piece of federal green financing legislation was simultaneously introduced in the Senate, where it received broad bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;Mcgowan, Elizabeth. "Clean Energy Investment Bank Has Bipartisan Support, But No Money"&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 2009 cap and trade legislation ultimately failed to pass the Senate, green bank advocates in the US focused on the state level.&lt;ref name="CGC Website" /&gt;  [[Connecticut]] established the first state green bank in 2011, followed by [[New York (state)|New York]] in 2013. By the end of fiscal year 2015, the Connecticut Green Bank had supported $663 million in project investments.

In the UK in 2009, two reports were published advocating the creation of a state-backed infrastructure bank to provide financing to green projects. The first, entitled "Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank" was published in March 2009 by&amp;nbsp;[[Climate Change Capital]]&amp;nbsp;and E3G.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank|url=https://www.e3g.org/docs/Accelerating_Green_Infrastructure_Financing.pdf|last=|first=|date=March 2009|website=E3g.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, entitled "Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain" was published by&amp;nbsp;[[Policy Exchange]]&amp;nbsp;in September 2009 and was written by&amp;nbsp;[[Dieter Helm]], James Wardlaw and&amp;nbsp;[[Ben Caldecott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/delivering-a-21st-century-infrastructure-for-britain|title=Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain|last=|first=|date=September 2009|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essential elements==
There are many types and styles of institutions that finance clean energy and green infrastructure projects. There are several key elements that distinguish green banks from other financing institutions: a focus on commercially viable technologies, a dedicated source of capital, a focus on leveraging private investment, and a relationship with government.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;

Green banks focus on commercially viable technologies, as opposed to early-stage innovative technologies, because they have been tested, have less associated “technology risk” and can reliably produce revenue for project owners.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, Hallie. "Working Paper: State Green Banks for Clean Energy"&lt;/ref&gt;  Green banks are public-purpose entities with some manner of a relationship with government, and are usually capitalized by public dollars.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;  Just like a [[commercial bank]], green banks lend capital and own [[debt]], so it is important they have their own [[balance sheet]]. Green banks also focus on using their capital to facilitate private entry into the clean energy market—specifically by using limited public dollars to leverage private investment in clean energy.

== Market barriers ==
For consumers, high upfront costs often make clean energy technology unattractive to adopt despite declines in clean energy technology costs.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Browner, Danielle Baussan, Ben Bovarnick, Mari Hernandez, Matt Kasper. "Clean Energy Investment in the United States&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, the clean energy sector has depended on taxpayer-funded [[Grant (money)|grants]], rebates, [[tax credit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and other [[Subsidy|subsidies]] to drive market development.&lt;ref name="Brookings Report"&gt;Ken Berlin, Reed Hundt, Marko Muro, and Devashree Saha. "State Clean Energy Banks: New Investment Facilities for Clean Energy Deployment"&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, private lenders would provide financing to building-owners to cover upfront cost of clean energy adoption (beyond what is covered by rebates). However, there are [[capital market]] inefficiencies and inherent challenges to financing clean energy that have resulted in inadequate investment by private lenders. Some private lenders do offer for clean energy projects, but typically charge [[interest rate]]s that are relatively high and [[loan]] tenors that are short.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Energy States Alliance. "Developing an Effective State Clean Energy Program: Clean Energy Loans"&lt;/ref&gt;  Such terms make financing a clean energy project unattractive from the end-user’s perspective. To be attractive from the end-user’s perspective, financing terms would be such that the monthly [[cash flow]] from clean energy projects would be greater than the monthly payments for the cost of financing. This kind of cash flow structure is only possible with loan terms that match the expected lifetime of the projects savings, and with rates that are commensurate with the risk. Therefore, private capital offered at unfavorable terms (if it is available at all) undercuts the economic attractiveness of the project potential customers or project developers.

A shortfall of private financing exists for several reasons. One reason is that there is a relatively short track record for clean energy financing, and therefore there is little data for lenders to rely on.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Alfred. "NY Green Bank: Introduction to Standardization and Collaboration"&lt;/ref&gt;  Without data, and observable pipeline of similar projects, banks are left with high levels of uncertainty over how well different types of projects perform and how often borrowers repay their loans. This uncertainty leads to either hesitation to enter the market, high due diligence costs and/or unfavorable lending terms.

Another reason for the financing gap is that many clean energy projects are small and distributed. Building efficiency upgrades and [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop solar]] projects are inherently small investments that are geographically dispersed, with varying [[Credit (finance)|credit]] among counter parties. Heterogeneity in clean energy projects is more expensive for a private lender to [[Underwriting|underwrite]] at scale, making loans for clean energy projects potentially uneconomical from the perspective of the lender.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Graham. "Responsible Marketplace Lending: Indispensable for Commercial Solar's Growth&lt;/ref&gt;

A third reason for the financing gap is the lack of capital market [[liquidity]] and maturity. If a commercial bank provides an [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] loan, it is unknown to the bank if it will be able to sell that loan to another lender or if it will have to hold that loan on its balance sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Financing Solutions Working Group. "Accessing Secondary Markets As a Capital Source for Energy Efficiency Finance Programs: Program Design Considerations for Policymakers and Administrators"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mortgage loan|Mortgage]] and auto lenders don’t have this difficulty, because there are highly liquid [[secondary market]]s for home and car loans, which helps keeps rates low. These kinds of secondary markets are just now forming for clean energy technologies.

The final cause of private underinvestment relates to human and organizational behavior. To begin lending into a new market, a bank must hire new staff, learn about the risks and processes of a new market, and determine precise criteria for what kind of projects and credit ratings they are willing to lend to. This process may be time-consuming.

==Financing activities==
To combat these barriers to clean energy market development, green banks help consumers secure long-term, low-interest loans. Green banks harness a diverse set of financing techniques, including credit enhancements, co-investment, and securitization.

===Credit enhancement ===
Green banks frequently utilize [[credit enhancement]]s to leverage private investment. Loan loss reserves, overcollateralization and subordinated debt can help assuage concern among private lenders who are interested in entering the market, but concerned about the risks associated with developers, counter parties or technologies with less established history in their given jurisdiction. Credit enhancements also help lower the cost of capital for borrowers and improve debt ratings from credit agencies.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;

===Co-investment===
Sometimes green banks invest directly in clean energy projects to facilitate additional private investment or improve the financial terms set by private lenders.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;

===Securitization===
[[Securitization|Securitizing]] clean energy loans makes lending far more attractive for private investors. Individual clean energy projects, which vary in credit, location, and technology, can be expensive for a bank to underwrite, and may not achieve the desired scale of investment. Bundling these loans into [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]] and selling them (or [[Share (finance)|shares]] of them) diffuses risk and creates scale, attracting a broader group of private investors.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;  A green bank can create and securitize portfolios of loans, allowing investors to purchase some portion of the green bank’s debt on the secondary market. Green banks can also add [[credit enhancement]]s, such as overcollateralization or loan loss reserves, to lower the creditors exposure to default risk and secure better ratings from credit rating agencies. Securitization provides greater liquidity in the market for clean energy project financing, which helps lower the [[cost of capital]] for borrowers.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;  The Connecticut Green Bank executed one of the first such securitization deals, selling 75% of its $40 million PACE portfolio to Clean Fund, a specialty finance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://srmnetwork.com/connecticuts-cefia-announces-industry-first-c-pace-portfolio-sale |title=Sustainable Real Estate Solutions » Connecticut’s CEFIA Announces Industry-First C-PACE Portfolio Sale |website=Srmnetwork.com |date=2014-05-19 |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing structures==
Green banks’ innovative financing techniques are more effective if they can operate through robust delivery mechanisms. Green banks can use these structures to increase the security of debt service payments and allow lenders to offer lower interest rates for clean energy financing.

===Property assessed clean energy ===
[[PACE financing|Property assessed clean energy (PACE) financing]] allows consumers to pay energy upgrade loans through [[property tax]]es. The process places a [[lien]] on the property, and the property owner then repays the financing through PACE assessments on the property tax bill.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;  This reduces the [[Default (finance)|default]] risk associated with a loan and incentivizes private investment. Because the PACE structure reduces risk, it allows consumers to obtain lower interest rates on their loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seia.org/policy/distributed-solar/property-assessed-clean-energy |title=Property-Assessed Clean Energy |publisher=SEIA |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the loans are attached to the property, when property is sold, the new owners take over loan repayment.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;

===On-bill financing===
On-bill financing permits consumers to repay energy upgrade loans through [[Public utility|utility]] bills.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt; Similar to PACE financing, on-bill repayment affords lenders security in a developing market. Because electricity is a necessity, utility bills have a very high rate of repayment nationwide. Placing loan payments on a utility bill increases their chances of being repaid, appealing to private investors and facilitating affordable loans for consumers.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;  Also, the on-bill structure enables renters to reap the benefits of added energy efficiency.  Furthermore, the simplicity of on-bill financing is attractive—it is logical that tenants pay for the good they consume.

== Market development activities ==
Sometimes the availability of clean energy financing products is not enough to stimulate the desired level of clean energy finance activity, and various non-finance market development activities are necessary as well. A green bank may design and execute various market development activities to build the market for clean energy. Market development activities may not directly involve lending, and a green bank may hire an outside organization to design and perform these activities.

=== Demand aggregation ===
Green banks or their partners can aggregate consumer demand for clean energy projects and financing to reduce [[customer acquisition cost]]s for contractors and provide scale for investors.&lt;ref name="Hundt Presentation"&gt;Reed Hundt. "Growing Clean Energy Markets Quickly with Green Bank Financing and Market Development"&lt;/ref&gt;  One means by which a green bank might aggregate demand is a neighborhood-wide group-buying deal. The Connecticut Green Bank and SolarizeCT have used this technique throughout Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://solarizect.com |title=Home - Solarize Connecticut |website=Solarizect.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contractor training ===
A green bank can organize contractor trainings, in which local clean energy technology installers, contractors, and developers learn about various green bank financing options. Contractor trainings allow contractors to use their knowledge of green bank financing products as a sales tool, increasing the size and volume of the projects they do. Ensuring that contractors fully understand green bank financing is a crucial means of getting that information to the end-users of the financing—building owners.

=== REC financing ===
Innovative renewable energy credit (REC) financing plans have also helped green banks lower energy costs for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Coalition for Green Capital. "Green Bank Product and Activity Overview"&lt;/ref&gt;  Green banks can agree to acquire and monetize the RECs that will be produced by a given clean energy project. After gaining possession of the RECs through the financing agreement, a green bank can then sell them to utilities. As a result of this activity, green banks can offer more favorable financing terms and utilities can obtain RECs in large volumes potentially at below market prices, reducing their cost of compliance and allowing them to pass savings on to their ratepayers.&lt;ref name="Hundt Presentation" /&gt;

=== Central clearinghouse  ===
Green banks also operate as an interface between lenders and borrowers. Green banks can offer a central clearinghouse for all online data on energy resources (including rebates and financing), technical assistance for investors, and project coordination services for contractors. By facilitating transparency and accessibility of resources, green banks bridge the gap between supply of and demand for capital for clean energy projects.

==Organizational structure and placement==
A green bank can take many forms. Green banks can be newly created entities, or it can be created by repurposing an existing entity. A green bank can be a direct part of government, such as a subdivision of an existing agency. The New York Green Bank, for example, is a division of the [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]] (NYSERDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenbank.ny.gov/About/Overview |title=Overview |website=Greenbank.ny.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A green bank can also be a quasi-public instrumentality, such as a wholly owned non-profit public corporation. The Connecticut Green Bank, for example, is a quasi-public entity with both government officials and independent directors serving on its board.&lt;ref name="CT Annual"&gt;Connecticut Green Bank. "Comprehensive Annual Financial Report: Fiscal Year 2015"&lt;/ref&gt; A green bank can also an independent non-profit entity administered by the government, either through a contract, or by purpose-building an entity to serve as green bank. The Montgomery County Green Bank, for example, is a non-profit organization that was purpose-built in accordance with legislation and serves as Montgomery County’s green bank as a result of a resolution of the County Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DEP/Energy/green-bank.html |title=Green Bank &amp;#124; Department of Environmental Protection, Montgomery County, MD |website=Montgomerycountymd.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of capital==
Green banks are usually seeded with public capital, and that capital can come from a wide variety of channels. The green bank finance model preserves limited supplies of public capital, allowing each dollar to be recycled continuously and utilized for multiple clean energy projects.&lt;ref name="CGC White Paper" /&gt;

===Ratepayer surcharge===
A state or local government may place a small [[surcharge (payment systems)|surcharge]] on energy bills within its [[jurisdiction]], and may require that the funds raised by this charge be disbursed to a green bank. Or the government may repurpose an existing surcharge and direct the revenue to a green bank. The surcharge can provide green banks with a yearly influx of capital.&lt;ref name="MD Report"&gt;Coalition for Green Capital. "Growing the Maryland Clean Energy Economy"&lt;/ref&gt;  The Connecticut Green Bank and New York Green Bank are capitalized in part by a systems benefit charge.

===Bond issuance===
Green banks can also issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to obtain capital. Public sector bonds have the benefit of being tax exempt, allowing governments and other public authorities to pay relatively low interest rates to bond owners.  A green bank’s bonding authority allows debt investors to secure a steady stream of payments from an institution with a low risk of default. In exchange, the green bank receives capital that it can immediately invest in clean energy deployment.

====Types of bonds====
*Green banks can be capitalized by bond issuances that are backed by state in which the green bank exists.&lt;ref name="Schub Bonds PPT"&gt;Schub, Jeff. "Bond Structures Typically Used By Green Banks"&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Green banks can also be capitalized by issuing bonds that are backed by the green bank itself.&lt;ref name="Schub Bonds PPT" /&gt;  
*Green banks can raise capital by issuing project bonds that are backed by the revenue-generating potential of the projects they will fund.&lt;ref name="Schub Bonds PPT" /&gt; Revenue Bonds from a Dedicated Cash Stream
*Other bonds backed by a dedicated cash stream (such as ratepayer fees, or by auctions of emissions allowances) can be issued to generate capital for a green bank.&lt;ref name="Schub Bonds PPT" /&gt; 
*If a green bank is short on capital, it can securitize loans it has issued (assets) and, through a secondary market, sell them to another investor as a bond. For example, the Connecticut Green Bank sold $30 million in bonds backed by commercial efficiency loans to Clean Fund.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardi, Nick. "In a Watershed Deal, Securitization Comes to Commercial Efficiency"&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Industrial revenue bonds and private activity bonds can be issued for certain green bank activities.&lt;ref name="Schub Bonds PPT" /&gt;

=== Revenue from carbon pricing ===
Green banks can also be partially capitalized by the revenue raised from various carbon pricing policies such as carbon taxes, fees, and cap-and-trade systems. For example, both the NYGB and the CGB are capitalized in part by the revenue each state raises through the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI).&lt;ref name="Brookings Report" /&gt;

===Direct budget appropriation===
A government can allocate dollars to a green bank as a part of its regular budget and appropriations process.

===Re-allocation of existing funds===
Sometimes an existing investment fund will be underused or completely unused. It may be possible to re-allocate some such funds and put the dollars to work in a green bank.&lt;ref name="MD Report" /&gt;

===Pension funds===
Pension funds can invest in deals or portfolios of deals generated by green banks.&lt;ref name="OECD Policy Report"&gt;Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. "Green Investment Banks: Policy Perspectives"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundations===
Foundations can make grants to green banks to fund startup costs, or they can make program-related investments in green banks and earn a return on their money in a way that is aligned with their mission.&lt;ref name="OECD Policy Report" /&gt;

===Community development financial institutions===
[[Community development financial institution]]s (CDFIs) can co-invest or provide startup capital for green banks. CDFIs can also provide important technical expertise in certain areas of green bank activity.

===Federal sources in the US===
*The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] and its [[Rural Utilities Service]] (RUS) program provide funding for infrastructure projects, including energy-related infrastructure, to rural communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/all-programs/electric-programs |title=Electric Programs &amp;#124; USDA Rural Development |website=Rd.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RUS has funding available that could be used by green banks to finance projects in rural areas.
*The [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) has programs, notably the Loan Program Office (LPO), which provides federal dollars for innovative clean energy companies and project portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office. "Federal Loan Guarantee Solicitation and Supplements for Renewable Energy Projects and Energy Efficiency Projects"*&lt;/ref&gt;  A green bank could take advantage of DOE money by building portfolios of projects designed to meet the standard set out by the LPO.
*The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has a [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]] (CWSRF) which makes low-cost financing available for various water and energy infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf/learn-about-clean-water-state-revolving-fund-cwsrf |title=Learn about the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) &amp;#124; Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) &amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date=2016-04-04 |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green banks can apply for access to these funds.

==Current green banks ==

===Connecticut Green Bank===
The Connecticut Green Bank (CGB) was established in 2011 and was the first green bank in the United States. It is the most advanced green bank in the nation in terms of deal volume. Connecticut’s legislature converted the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, a grant-focused promoter of clean energy investment, into a deployment financing entity. The CGB is quasi-public and its board of directors is composed of both government officials and independent directors.&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut Green Bank. "Bylaws: Pursuant to Section 16-245n of the Connecticut General Statutes"&lt;/ref&gt;  The CGB is continually capitalized by a systems benefit charge and revenue generated by Connecticut’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) trading program.&lt;ref name="CT Annual" /&gt;  The bank also possesses the ability to issue its own bonds based on its balance sheet.

In its first four years of existence, the CGB has stimulated $663.2 million of investment in clean energy projects, three-fourths of which came from the private sector.&lt;ref name="CT Annual" /&gt;  The increase in clean energy investment coincided with a huge decline in the number of taxpayer-funded clean energy grants. In effect, the CGB increased clean energy investment while reducing taxpayers’ financial burden.

===New York Green Bank===
Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] created the largest Green Bank in the nation, NY Green Bank (NYGB), and capitalized it through re-purposed ratepayer surcharges and revenues generated by the issuance of emissions permits.&lt;ref&gt;NYSERDA. "NY Green Bank Business Plan"&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]] (NYSERDA) designed a 5-year capitalization structure with multiple infusions of capital summing to $1 billion.&lt;ref name="MD Report" /&gt; The NYGB is now a fully staffed entity and operates as a [[wholesale]] clean energy finance lender (as opposed to Connecticut, which operates more as a [[retail]] lender).&lt;ref&gt;Enerknol. "NY Green Bank Highlights Role of Innovation in Solar Financing"&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than design specific financing products and programs, the NYGB relies on the market to learn what financing is needed.

To date, the NYGB has received over $1 billion in proposals and has an active project pipeline of ~$500 million.&lt;ref&gt;NYSERDA. "Clean Energy Fund Information Supplement: Case 14-M-0094"&lt;/ref&gt;  The first set of NYGB investments were announced in the fall of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;NYSERDA. "Governor Cuomo Announces Three New York Green Bank Transactions to Improve Access to Clean Energy and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions"&lt;/ref&gt;  The NYGB used $49 million of public capital to leverage $178 million in private capital, achieving a leverage ratio greater that 3:1.

===California CLEEN Center===
The California Lending for Energy and Environmental Needs Center operates as the state’s green bank. The CLEEN center exists within the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. One of the center’s major initiatives—the Statewide Energy Efficiency Program (SWEEP)—finances energy efficiency projects and upgrades for municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. "Criteria, Priorities, and Guidelines for the Selection of Projects for IBank Financing Under the California Lending for Energy and Environmental Needs Center&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the Connecticut and New York Green Banks, the CLEEN Center exclusively facilitates commercial projects and upgrades. Interested parties propose a project and apply for financial assistance with the CLEEN Center. CLEEN projects receive funding ranging from $500,000 to $30 million.&lt;ref name="Energy Dept" /&gt;

===Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority===
The Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority was created in 2014 to finance clean energy development in Hawaii. The first program to be adopted was the Green Energy Market Securitization (GEMS) program—an effort to provide the low-to-moderate income market with solar lease financing.&lt;ref&gt;State of Hawaii. "Status of the Green Infrastructure Authority's Activities: Report to the Governor and the Legislature of the State of Hawaii"&lt;/ref&gt;  For geographical reasons, electricity is more expensive in Hawaii than anywhere else in the United States. The advent of solar leasing has allowed many Hawaiian homeowners to install solar panels, but solar market penetration has hardly reached low-credit households.&lt;ref name="Energy Dept" /&gt;  The cash flow positive financing generated by GEMS is designed to help low-to-moderate income Hawaiians enter a market from which they have historically been excluded.

===Rhode Island===
In 2015, state legislators converted the Rhode Island Clean Water Finance Agency (RICWFA) into the Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank (RIIB).&lt;ref name="RICFWA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riinfrastructurebank.com |title=RI Infrastructure Bank |publisher=RI Infrastructure Bank |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RIIB offers both residential and commercial PACE programs designed to reduce energy costs for consumers. The RIIB also created the Efficient Buildings Fund, a program used to provide low-cost financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in public buildings.&lt;ref name="RICFWA" /&gt;

===Montgomery County, MD===
[[Montgomery County, Maryland]] is the only county in the U.S. that has created a local green bank.&lt;ref&gt;Devashree Saha and Mark Muro. "Green Banking Goes Local"&lt;/ref&gt;  The Montgomery County Green Bank (MCGB) was capitalized with $20 million from the settlement that accompanied the merger of utilities [[Pepco]] and [[Exelon]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Heath and Aaron C. Davis. "DC Regulators green-light Pepco-Exelon Merger, creating largest utility in the nation"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
Malaysia’s Green Technology Financing Corporation was launched in 2010 as a component of the government’s National Green Technology Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmalaysia.my/expertise/financing |title=Green Financing &amp;#124; GreenTech Malaysia |website=Greentechmalaysia.my |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the Green Technology Financing Scheme, the corporation offers companies a 2% interest rate buy down and 60% guaranteed financing for green technology projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gtfs.my/page/application-process |title=Application Process &amp;#124; Green Technology Financing Scheme |website=Gtfs.my |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In 2012, the [[UK government]] created the [[UK Green Investment Bank]] (GIB) to attract private funds for the financing of the private sector's investments related to environmental preservation and improvement. It is structured as a [[public limited company]] and is owned by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS).  Its headquarters are in [[Edinburgh]], where it is also registered, and it has a secondary office in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/green-investment-britain-idUSL5E8E86QQ20120308|title=UK to base Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh, London|last=|first=|date=March 2012|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GIB works with a variety of technologies including energy efficiency, waste and [[bioenergy]], [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind]], and onshore renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeninvestmentbank.com/our-investments/ |title=Our investments &amp;#124; UK |publisher=Green Investment Bank |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UK’s GIB has committed £2.6 billion to 76 domestic infrastructure projects, mobilizing over £10 billion of private investment.&lt;ref&gt;Green Investment Bank. "Summary of Transactions: Transactions to Date"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwf.org.uk/about_wwf/press_centre/?unewsid=7733 |title=Green Investment Bank mobilises £10 billion for projects - WWF praises success but flags concern over future of GIB's green mission - WWF UK - Green Investment Bank,green infrastructure projects,renewable energy, energy efficiency industries |website=Wwf.org.uk |date=2015-11-24 |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the UK government announced that it planned to move the GIB to the private sector. The government plans to sell its shares in the GIB, but will seek to retain a ‘special share’ to ensure the continued protection of GIB’s green purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537293/gib-annual-report-2015-16-web.pdf|title=UK Green Investment Bank plc Annual Report and Accounts 2015–16|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia’s [[Clean Energy Finance Corporation]] (CEFC) was founded in 2012 with the purpose of mobilizing investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and low emissions technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au/what-we-do.aspx |title=What we do - Clean Energy Finance Corporation |website=Cleanenergyfinancecorp.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the beginning of fiscal year 2016, the CEFC had invested $1.4 billion of its own capital and attracted $2.2 billion in private sector investment.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Energy Finance Corporation. "Annual Report 2014-2015"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Bank Network==
The Green Bank Network is an international membership organization focusing on solutions to clean energy finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenbanknetwork.org/about-us/ |title=About the GBN – Green Bank Network |website=Greenbanknetwork.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched at the 2015 [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP21]] meeting in Paris, by state and national Green Banks  in Connecticut, Australia, Malaysia, New York, Japan and the United Kingdom, and the non-profits the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) and the [[Coalition for Green Capital]] (CGC).

[[File:Tor supercell above.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supercell]]ular [[thunderstorm]] image showing [[cumulus cloud|cumulus]] inflow bands]]
'''Inflow''' is the flow of a fluid into a large collection of that fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/w/index.php?title=Inflow&amp;oldid=5579 |work=Glossary of Meteorology |title=inflow |date=June 2000|accessdate=5 February 2016 |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[meteorology]], inflow normally refers to the influx of warmth and moisture from air within the [[Earth's atmosphere]] into [[storm]] systems. Extratropical cyclones are fed by inflow focused along their [[cold front]] and [[warm front]]s. Tropical cyclones require a large inflow of warmth and moisture from warm oceans in order to develop significantly, mainly within the lowest {{convert|1|km|mi}} of the atmosphere. Once the flow of warm and moist air is cut off from thunderstorms and their associated [[tornado]]es, normally by the thunderstorm's own rain-cooled [[outflow boundary]], the storms begin to dissipate. [[Rear-inflow jet|Rear inflow jet]]s behind [[squall line]]s act to erode the broad [[precipitation (meteorology)|rain]] shield behind the squall line, and accelerate its forward motion.

==Thunderstorms==
[[File:Anvil shaped cumulus panorama edit crop.jpg|thumb|right|Thunderstorm in its mature stage over [[Swifts Creek, Victoria]]]]
{{See also|Squall line|Thunderstorm|Tornado}}
Cool air, carried to the ground by thunderstorm downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The Weather World 2010 Project |publisher=University of Illinois |url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/svr/comp/wind/home.rxml |title=Vertical Wind Shear |accessdate=21 October 2006 |date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado.&lt;ref name="Advanced Spotter Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf |title=Advanced Spotters' Field Guide |accessdate=20 September 2006 |last1=Doswell |last2=Moller |last3=Anderson |year=2005 |format=PDF |publisher=US Department of Commerce |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823090940/http://www.weather.gov/os/brochures/adv_spotters.pdf |archivedate=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops to the south of the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of [[rain]] within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/MG/PDFs/prep86_smul_rear.pdf |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |accessdate=23 November 2009 |date=22 September 1986 |title=The Rear Inflow Jet of Mesoscale Convective Systems |first1=Bradley F. |last1=Smull |first2=Robert A.

{{See also|Tropical cyclone}}
While an initial warm core system, such as an organized thunderstorm complex, is necessary for the formation of a tropical cyclone, a large flux of energy is needed to lower [[atmospheric pressure]] more than a few millibars (0.10&amp;nbsp;inch of [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). Inflow of warmth and moisture from the underlying ocean surface is critical for tropical cyclone strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Monthly Weather Review |date=August 1995 |title=Evolution of the Inflow Boundary Layer of Hurricane Gilbert (1988) |first1=Gary M. |last1=Barnes |first2=Mark D. |last2=Powell |publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] |url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Powell/Barnes.pdf |volume=123 |issue=8 |page=2348 |bibcode=1995MWRv..123.2348B |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123&lt;2348:EOTIBL&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant amount of the inflow in the cyclone is in the lowest {{convert|1|km|ft}} of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/iwtc/Marks1_1.html|title=Fifth International Workshop on Tropical Cyclones Topic 1 Tropical Cyclone Structure and Structure Change |first=Frank |last=Marks |date=27 January 2003 |accessdate=23 November 2009 |publisher=[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extratropical cyclones==

{{See also|Extratropical cyclone|Norwegian cyclone model|Weather fronts}}
Polar front theory is attributed to [[Jacob Bjerknes]], and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in [[Norway]] during [[World War I]]. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a [[cyclone]] was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the [[warm front]]. The trailing convergence zone was referred to as the [[squall line]] or [[cold front]]. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones.&lt;ref name="OU"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Oklahoma |url=http://weather.ou.edu/~metr4424/Files/Norwegian_Cyclone_Model.pdf |title=The Norwegian Cyclone Model |date=25 September 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901163934/http://weather.ou.edu/~metr4424/Files/Norwegian_Cyclone_Model.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969.&lt;ref name="COLD"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. M. |last=Schultz |year=2001 |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=129 |issue=9 |pages=2205–2225 |publisher=University of Oklahoma |url=http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~schultz/ccb/ccb.shtml |title=Reexamining the Cold Conveyor Belt |accessdate=17 May 2007 |bibcode=2001MWRv..129.2205S |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129&lt;2205:RTCCB&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left edge of the conveyor belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of [[Stratus cloud|stratiform]] precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along the conveyor belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls in the form of heavy snow.&lt;ref name="OU"/&gt; Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence as to whether or not this phenomenon actually exists.&lt;ref name="COLD"/&gt;

== History ==

[[Karl Rawer]], the first chairman of the ''URSI/COSPAR Task group on the IRI''  (1968–84) specified as goal of the IRI to establish a (monthly) average [[Ionospheric model|model of the terrestrial ionosphere]] based on reliably-measured data obtained with ground- and space-based methods. Contradictions between these had to be resolved in critical discussions. After a decade filled with data collection, a first set of tables was given out in 1978. Computer source code in [[ALGOL]] and [[Fortran]] followed. In 1986, the code became available on [[floppy disk]], and later on the Web.&lt;ref name="irimodel.org"/&gt; It is improved yearly according to the results obtained at the meetings of the task group, which often occur at COSPAR meetings. Since 1999, IRI has been the "International Standard" for the terrestrial ionosphere.

== Contents ==

IRI used (and still has an option to use) an [[ITU-R]]-model that had been developed in respect to [[radio propagation]] via the ionosphere, specifying two parameters of which one is narrowly related to the peak electron density and the other to the peak altitude of the ionosphere. Both have been and are regularly determined from [[ionogram]]s at all [[ionospheric sounding]] stations. The authors R. M. Gallet and W. B. Jones had analyzed a wealth of such data from around the world by a method combining [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] analysis in time with worldwide [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre]] analysis of the Fourier coefficients. Meanwhile, regional models are often applied because they reach better local performance.

The IRI model specifies monthly averages of electron [[density]], [[electron]] and [[ion]] [[temperature]], and the relative percentage of several different positive ions (O+, H+, He+, N+, NO+, O2+, and Cluster ions).&lt;ref name="Bilitza"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bilitza|first1=Dieter|title=International Reference Ionosphere|url=https://cedarweb.vsp.ucar.edu/wiki/images/4/4b/IRI.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model can represent variaition of these quantities with altitude, latitude, longitude, date, and time of day. It can also make use of solar, ionospheric and geomagnetic indices to refine the model. Vertical total electron content (TEC) may be derived. (A snapshot of model predictions is shown in the latitude vs. longitude map above).&lt;ref&gt;http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/modelweb/ionos/iri.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The rain forest is a major catchment area for two of the most important rivers in southern Sri Lanka, the [[Gin River|Gin]] and Nilwala Rivers. This biosphere reserve harbors many plants and animal species endemic to [[Sri Lanka]].

==Physical features==
The biosphere consists series of parallel mountain ranges and valleys. The [[elevation]] ranges from 60&amp;nbsp;m to 425&amp;nbsp;m above sea level.&lt;ref name="Senarathna 2006"&gt;{{si icon}} {{cite book|last=Senarathna|first=P.M.|title=Sri Lankawe Wananthara|publisher=Sarasavi Publishers|year=2005|edition=1st|pages=107–112|isbn=955-573-401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mean annual temperature is 27.0&amp;nbsp;°C while annual temperature variation is 4&amp;nbsp;°C-5&amp;nbsp;°C. The forest receives a substantial rainfall of 3,750&amp;nbsp;mm. Many ancient [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonimic groups]] of [[Gondwana]] are present in these rain forests. They also relates to [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indomalayan]] plants and animals.

==Hydrological features==
The forest complex act as an important [[drainage basin|catchment area]] for many rivers and streams flow through the area. The forest is the source for [[Gin River]], which flows west to the forest and for Nilwala river which flows east to the forest.&lt;ref name="Senarathna 2006" /&gt; Kanneli, Nanikiththa and Udugama are the smaller streams of Kanneliya while Homa dola and Gal bandi dola are sourced by Nakiyadeniya and Deiyagala.

==Flora==
The KDN forest complex shows a degree of floral [[endemism|endemicity]], as 17 percent of lowland endemic floral species are confined to this forest area.&lt;ref name="Bandaratillake '03" /&gt; Of 319 [[woody plant]]s recorded in the area, about 52 per cent is [[endemism|endemic]]. The [[vegetation]] of KDN complex represents [[Sri Lanka lowland rain forests]].&lt;ref name="Bandaratillake '03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Senarathna 2006" /&gt; The [[Community (ecology)|floral communities]] dominated by ''[[Shorea]]-[[Dipterocarpus]]-[[Mesua]]'' ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] "Doona-Hora-Na") are common in [[emergent layer]] of the forest.

Numerous [[Herbalism|medicinal plants]] are found in these forests. They include ''Concinium fenestratum'' ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] "Weniwelgata"), ''[[Salacia reticulata]]'' ("Kothala Himbutu"), and ''Tinospora cordifolia'' ("Rasakinda").&lt;ref name="Senarathna 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globosapiens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globosapiens.net/travel-information/Udugama-2404.html|title=Kanneliya,Dediyagala-,nakiyadeniya reserved Forest|first=Nishantha|work=globosapiens.net|publisher=globosapiens.net|accessdate=2009-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328130214/http://www.globosapiens.net/travel-information/Udugama-2404.html|archivedate=2009-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lycopodium Squarrosum'' ("Kuda hadaya"), and ''[[Huperzia phlegmaria|Lycopodium phlegmaria]]'' ("Maha hadaya") are among the rare plants the forest complex harbors.

==Fauna==
Some 220 faunal species recorded from the KDN forests and forests around the KDN.&lt;ref name="Bandaratillake '03" /&gt; This includes 41 endemic species. The forest complex is home to 86 species [[mammal]]s. This includes 4 species of [[shrew]]s, 5 [[rodent]]s, one [[carnivore]] and 2 [[primate]]s.&lt;ref name="Senarathna 2006" /&gt; Out of 26 [[South Asia#Species endemic to Sri Lanka|endemic birds]] of Sri Lanka, 20 of them can be seen in KDN forest complex.&lt;ref name="Senarathna 2006" /&gt; [[Sri Lanka spurfowl]], [[Sri Lanka junglefowl]], [[Sri Lanka grey hornbill]], [[red-faced malkoha]], [[orange-billed babbler]], [[Sri Lanka blue magpie]] are some of them.&lt;ref name="globosapiens" /&gt; 20 percent of Sri Lanka's endemic [[freshwater fish]]es inhabit in the waters of [[Gin River]] and Nilwala River, which sourced by the springs of Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya. Among the forests' [[herpetofauna]] are 36 species of [[snake]]s, 17 endemic species belonging to 6 families. A total of 23 species of [[lizard]]s recorded in these rain forests.

A '''limnic eruption''', also termed a '''lake overturn''', is a rare type of [[natural disaster]] in which dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) suddenly erupts from deep lake waters, forming a gas cloud capable of suffocating wildlife, livestock, and humans. A limnic eruption may also cause [[tsunami]]s as the rising {{CO2}} displaces water. Scientists believe [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano|volcanic activity]], and other explosive events can serve as triggers for limnic eruptions. Lakes in which such activity occurs are referred to as '''limnically active lakes''' or '''exploding lakes'''. Some features of limnically active lakes include:
*{{CO2}}-saturated incoming water
*A cool lake bottom indicating an absence of direct volcanic interaction with lake waters
*An upper and lower thermal layer with differing {{CO2}} saturations
*Proximity to areas with volcanic activity

Investigations of the [[Lake Monoun]] and [[Lake Nyos disaster|Lake Nyos]] casualties led scientists to classify limnic eruptions as a distinct type of disaster event, even though they can be indirectly linked to volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref name="USGS vulcan"&gt;[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/Lakes/description_volcanic_lakes_gas_release.html Volcanic Lakes and Gas Releases] USGS/[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/ Cascades Volcano Observatory], Vancouver, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical occurrences ==
[[Image:Cow killed by Lake Nyos gasses.jpg|thumb|Cattle killed by the 1986 limnic eruption at [[Lake Nyos]].]]
Due to the largely invisible nature of the underlying cause (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas) behind limnic eruptions, it is difficult to determine to what extent eruptions have occurred in the past. In recent history, this phenomenon has been observed twice. The first limnic eruption occurred in [[Cameroon]] at Lake Monoun in 1984, causing [[asphyxia]]tion and death of 37 people living nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1987JVGR...31....1S |title=Origin of the lethal gas burst from [[Lake Monoun]], Cameroun |last1=Sigurdsson |first1=H. |volume=31 |year=1987 |pages=1–16 |journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research |doi=10.1016/0377-0273(87)90002-3 |last2=Devine |first2=J.D. |last3=Tchua |first3=F.M. |last4=Presser |first4=F.M. |last5=Pringle |first5=M.K.W. |last6=Evans |first6=W.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second, deadlier eruption [[Lake Nyos disaster|happened at neighbouring Lake Nyos]] in 1986, this time releasing over 80 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; killing around 1,700 people and 3,500 livestock, again by asphyxiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.236.4798.169 |title=The 1986 [[Lake Nyos]] Gas Disaster in Cameroon, West Africa |year=1987 |last1=Kling |first1=George W. |last2=Clark |first2=Michael A. |last3=Wagner |first3=Glen N. |last4=Compton |first4=Harry R. |last5=Humphrey |first5=Alan M. |last6=Devine |first6=Joseph D. |last7=Evans |first7=William C. |last8=Lockwood |first8=John P. |last9=Tuttle |first9=Michele L. |last10=Koenigsberg |first10=E.

A third lake, [[Lake Kivu]], rests on the border between the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], and contains massive amounts of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Sediment samples from the lake taken by Professor Robert Hecky ([[University of Michigan]]) showed an event caused living creatures in the lake to go extinct around every 1000 years, and caused nearby vegetation to be swept back into the lake. Limnic eruptions can be detected and quantified on a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration scale by taking air samples of the affected region.

The [[Messel pit]] [[fossil]] deposits of [[Messel]], [[Germany]], show evidence of a limnic eruption there in the early [[Eocene]]. Among the victims are perfectly preserved [[insect]]s, [[frog]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[bird]]s, [[anteater]]s, [[insectivore]]s, early [[primate]]s, and [[palaeotheriidae|paleothere]]s.

== Causes ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
For a lake to undergo a limnic eruption, the water must be nearly [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] with gas. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was the primary component in the two observed cases (Lake Nyos and Lake Monoun). In Lake Kivu, scientists{{who|date=August 2016}} are concerned about the concentrations of [[methane]] gas as well. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may originate from [[volcanic gas]] emitted from under the lake or from decomposition of organic material. Before a lake is saturated, it behaves like an unopened [[carbonation|carbonated beverage]] (e.g., a [[soft drink]]): the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Solvation|dissolved]] in the water.  In both the lake and the soft drink, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissolves much more readily at higher [[pressure]] ([[Henry's law]]). This is why bubbles in a can of soda form only after the can is opened; when the pressure is released, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes out of [[solution]]. In the case of lakes, the bottom is at a much higher pressure; the deeper it is, the higher the pressure is at the bottom. Therefore huge amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be dissolved in large, deep lakes. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also dissolves more readily in cooler water, such as that found at a lake bottom. A small rise in water [[temperature]] can lead to the release of a large amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Once a lake is saturated with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it is very unstable, but a trigger is needed to set off an eruption. In the case of the 1986 Lake Nyos eruption, [[landslide]]s were the suspected triggers, but a volcanic eruption, an [[earthquake]], or even [[wind]] and [[rain|rain storms]] are potential triggers. Another possible cause of a limnic eruption is gradual gas saturation at specific depths which can trigger spontaneous gas development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tassi|first=Franco|date=2014|title=An overview of the structure, hazards, and methods of investigation of Nyos-type lakes from the geochemical perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Limnology|volume=73|issue=1|doi=10.4081/jlimnol.2014.836|pmid=|via=EBSCO host}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any of these cases, the trigger pushes some of the gas-saturated water higher in the lake, where pressure is insufficient to keep CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in solution. As bubbles start forming the water is lifted even higher in the lake ([[buoyancy]]), where yet more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes out of solution. This process forms a column of gas, at which point the water at the bottom of this column is pulled up by [[suction]], and it, too, loses CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a runaway process.  This eruption discharges CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the air and can even displace enough water to form a tsunami.

Limnic eruptions are exceptionally rare for several reasons. First, a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source must exist (regions with volcanic activity are most at risk). Second, the vast majority of lakes are [[holomictic]] (i.e., their layers mix regularly), preventing a buildup of dissolved gases. Only [[meromictic lake]]s do not mix and remain [[Stratification (water)|stratified]], allowing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to remain dissolved. It is estimated only one meromictic lake exists for every 1,000 holomictic lakes&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt;. Finally, a lake must be deep enough to have sufficient pressure to dissolve large amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Consequences ==
Once an eruption occurs, a large CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cloud forms above the lake and expands to the surrounding region. Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Density|denser]] than air, it has a tendency to sink to the ground, simultaneously displacing breathable air, resulting in [[asphyxia]]. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can make human bodily fluids highly acidic and potentially cause [[Hypercapnia|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; poisoning]]. As victims gasp for air, they actually accelerate asphyxia by inhaling CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.

At Lake Nyos, the gas cloud descended into a nearby village where it settled, killing nearly everyone; casualties as far as {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} were reported&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;. A change in skin color on some bodies led scientists to hypothesize the gas cloud may have contained dissolved acid such as [[hydrogen chloride]], though this hypothesis is disputed.&lt;ref name="PMC"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2507040 |year=1989 |last1=Freeth |first1=SJ |title=Lake Nyos disaster |volume=299 |issue=6697 |pages=513 |pmc=1837334 |journal=BMJ |doi=10.1136/bmj.299.6697.513-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many victims were found with blisters on their skin, thought to have been caused by [[pressure ulcer]]s, which were likely caused by low blood oxygen levels in those asphyxiated by carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/killerlakestrans.shtml BBC Horizon programme "Killer Lakes"]&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of cattle and wild animals were also asphyxiated, but no official count reported&lt;!-- Link to unofficial report please. --&gt;. Notably, nearby vegetation was largely unaffected, except any growing immediately adjacent to the lake. There, vegetation was damaged or destroyed by a {{convert|24|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=on}} high tsunami caused by the violent eruption.&lt;ref name="NatHaz2014"&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Tsunami impact on the African continent: historical cases and hazard evaluation | author-last=Gusiakov | author-first=V.K. | title=Extreme Natural Hazards, Disaster Risks and Societal Implications | publisher=Cambridge University Press | editors=Ismail-Zadeh, A.;  Urrutia Fucugauchi, J.; Kijko, A.; Takeuchi, K.; Zaliapin, I. (editors) | year=2014 | location=Cambridge | pages=230 | isbn=978-1-107-03386-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon dioxide released from a lake is at a low enough temperature to cause frostbite&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;, consistent with blisters found on the skin of survivors of the [[Lake Monoun]] eruption&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;. Survivors reported a smell of rotten eggs and feeling warm before passing out&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;; this could be explained by sensory [[hallucination]] associated with high blood concentrations of carbon dioxide&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;. Studies of jet pilots and carbon dioxide exposure report similar effects as reported by limnic eruption survivors: the smell of rotten eggs or gunpowder, and a feeling of warmth&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Degassing ==

Efforts are under way to develop a solution for removing the gas from these lakes and to prevent a build-up which could lead to another catastrophe. A team led by French scientist [[Michel Halbwachs]] began experimenting at [[Lake Monoun]] and [[Lake Nyos]] in 1990 using [[siphon]]s to degas the waters of these lakes in a controlled manner.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1155057.stm BBC Cameroons "killer lake" degassed]&lt;/ref&gt; The team positions a pipe vertically in the lake with its upper end above the water surface. Water saturated with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enters the bottom of the pipe and rises to the top. The lower pressure at the surface allows the gas to come out of solution. Only a small amount of water must be mechanically pumped initially through the pipe to start the flow. As saturated water rises, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes out of solution and forms bubbles. The natural buoyancy of the bubbles draws the water up the pipe at high velocity resulting in a fountain at the surface. The degassifying water acts like a pump, drawing more water into the bottom of the pipe, and creating a self-sustaining flow. This is the same process which leads to a natural eruption, but in this case it is controlled by the size of the pipe.

Each pipe has a limited pumping capacity and several would be required for both [[Lake Monoun]] and [[Lake Nyos]] to degas a significant fraction of the deep lake water and render the lakes safe&lt;!-- from limnic ereuption --&gt;.  The deep lake waters are slightly acidic due to the dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which causes corrosion to the pipes and electronics&lt;!-- what electronics? --&gt;, necessitating ongoing maintenance. There is some concern CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the pipes could settle on the surface of the lake forming a thin layer of unbreathable air and thus potentially causing problems for wildlife.

In January 2001, a single pipe was installed by the [[French Cameroons|French-Cameroun]] team on [[Lake Nyos]], and two more pipes were installed in 2011 with funding support from the [[United Nations Development Programme]].&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;&lt;ref name=hsw&gt;{{cite web|last=Nasr|first=Susan|title=How did Lake Nyos suddenly kill 1,700 people?|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/lake-nyos4.htm|work=HowStuffWorks.com|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pipe was installed at [[Lake Monoun]] in 2003 and two more were added in 2006.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;&lt;ref name=hsw /&gt;  These three pipes are thought to be sufficient to prevent an increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, removing approximately the same amount of gas that naturally enters at the lake bed&lt;sup&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;. In January 2003, an 18-month project was approved to fully degas [[Lake Monoun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Nicola Jones | title= Lake to lose its silent killer  | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17723801.200-lake-to-lose-its-silent-killer.html | work=newscientist | date=1 February 2003  | accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lake has since been rendered safe.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/4661033a |title=Battle to degas deadly lakes continues |year=2010 |last1=Jones |first1=Nicola |journal=Nature |volume=466 |issue=7310 |pages=1033 |pmid=20739980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lake Kivu's potential danger ==
[[Image:LakeKivu satellite.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;!-- Year? --&gt;Satellite image of [[Lake Kivu]].]]
[[Lake Kivu]] is not only 2,000 times larger than [[Lake Nyos]], but is also located in a far more densely populated area, with over two million people living along its shores. Lake Kivu has not reached a high level of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[wikt:saturation|saturation]]
yet; if the water were to become heavily saturated, a limnic eruption would pose a great risk to human and animal life. Two significant changes in Lake Kivu's physical state have brought attention to a possible limnic eruption: the high rates of [[methane]] dissociation and a rising surface temperature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katsev|first=Sergei|date=2014|title=Recent Warming of Lake Kivu|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0109084#s1|journal=PLOS ONE|issue=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0109084|pmid=|access-date=2016-09-13|via=|bibcode=2014PLoSO...9j9084K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research investigating historical and present-day temperatures show Lake Kivu's surface temperature is increasing by about 0.12&amp;nbsp;°C per decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lake Kivu is in close proximity to potential triggers: [[Mount Nyiragongo]] (an active volcano which erupted in January 2002), an active earthquake zone, and other active volcanoes.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

While the lake could be degassed in a manner similar to Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, due to the size of Lake Kivu and the volume of gas it contains, such an operation would be expensive, running into the millions of dollars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} A scheme initiated in 2010 to use methane trapped in the lake as a fuel source to generate electricity in [[Rwanda]] has led to a degree of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degassing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/16/rwanda-gas-lake-kivu | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Rwanda harnesses volcanic gases from depths of Lake Kivu | first=Xan | last=Rice | date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the procedure for extracting the flammable methane gas used to fuel power stations on the shore, some CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is removed in a process known as [[catalyst scrubbing]]. It is unclear whether enough gas will be removed to eliminate the danger of a limnic eruption at Lake Kivu.

This '''list of Anuran families''' shows all extant [[family (biology)|families]] of [[Frog|Anura]]. Anura is the name of an order of animals in the class [[Amphibia]] that includes [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s. More than 5,000 species are described in the order. The living anurans are typically divided into three suborders: [[Archaeobatrachia]], [[Mesobatrachia]], and [[Neobatrachia]]. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles.

==Taxonomy==&lt;!-- Please see * '''Grant''', Taran; Frost, Darrel R.; Caldwell, Janalee P.; Gagliardo, Ron; Haddad, Celio F.B.; Kok, Philippe J.R.; Means, D. Bruce; Noonan, Brice P.; Schargel, Walter E. &amp; Wheeler, Ward (2006): Phylogenetic systematics of dart-poison frogs and their relatives (Amphibia, Athesphatanura, Dendrobatidae). ''Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History'' '''299''': 1-262. [http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/5803/1/B299.pdf PDF fulltext] for dendrobatid split --&gt;
The archaeobatrachians are the most primitive of frogs. These frogs have morphological characteristics which are found mostly in extinct frogs, and are absent in most of the modern frog species. Most of these characteristics are not common between all the families of Archaeobatrachia, or are not absent from all the modern species of frogs. However, all archaeobatrachians have free vertebrae, whereas all other species of frogs have their ribs fused to their vertebrae.

The Neobatrachia comprise the most modern species of frogs. Most of these frogs have morphological features which are more complex than those of the mesobatrachians and archaeobatrachians. The neobatrachians all have a [[palatine bone]], which braces the upper jaw to the [[neurocranium]]. This is absent in all Archaeobatrachia and some Mesobatrachia. The third distal [[carpus]] is fused with the remaining carpal bones. The [[adductor longus]] muscle is present in the neobatrachians, but absent in the archaeobatrachians and some mesobatrachians. It is believed to have differentiated from [[pectineus muscle]], and this differentiation has not occurred in the primitive frogs. 

The Mesobatrachia are considered the evolutionary link between the Archaeobatrachia and the Neobatrachia. The families within the mesobatrachian suborder generally contain morphological features typical of both the other suborders. For example, the palatine bone is absent in all archaeobatrachians, and present in all neobatrachians. However, within the mesobatrachians families, it can be dependent on the species as to whether the palatine bone is present.

Due to the many morphological features which separate the frogs, many different systems are used for the classification of the anuran suborders. These different classification systems usually split the Mesobatrachia suborder.

The '''List of Florida hurricanes''' encompasses approximately 500&amp;nbsp;[[Tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s &lt;!--as of 2017--&gt;that affected the state of [[Florida]]. More storms hit Florida than any other [[U.S. state]],&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=After Great Hurricane of 1896|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4032/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 1851 only eighteen hurricane seasons passed without a known storm impacting the state. Collectively, cyclones that hit the region have resulted in over 10,000 deaths, most of which occurring prior to the start of [[Hurricane Hunters]] flights in 1943. Additionally, the cumulative impact from the storms totaled over $191&amp;nbsp;billion in damage (2017&amp;nbsp;USD), primarily from [[Hurricane Andrew]], [[Hurricane Irma]] and hurricanes in the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004]] and [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]] seasons.

==Climatology==

{{most intense US hurricanes|align=right}}

Tropical cyclones have affected Florida in every month of the year with the exceptions of January and March. Nearly one-third of the cyclones affected the state in September, and nearly three-fourths of the storms affected the state between August and October, which coincides with the peak of the hurricane season. Portions of the coastline have the lowest return period, or the frequency at which a certain intensity or category of hurricane can be expected within 86&amp;nbsp;[[Statute mile|mi]] (139&amp;nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]]) of a given location, in the country. [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] was struck by 26 hurricanes since [[1926 Atlantic hurricane season|1926]], which is the greatest total for any county in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2006|title=Tropical Cyclone Climatology|accessdate=2007-10-02|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Monthly Weather Review]]'' paper published in 1934, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|U.S. Weather Bureau]] recognized [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] as the most hurricane-prone cities in the state; Key West experiences both storms developing from the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]], while Pensacola has received hurricanes crossing the state as well as storms recurving in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Gray|year=1933|title=Florida Hurricanes|publisher=U.S. Weather Bureau|accessdate=2007-10-02|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/061/mwr-061-01-0011.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest storm to affect the state was the [[1952 Groundhog Day Tropical Storm]], and the latest storm to impact the state was a hurricane making landfall on December&amp;nbsp;1, 1925.

The strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on the state was the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]], which crossed the [[Florida Keys]] with a pressure of 892&amp;nbsp;[[Millibar|mbar]] ([[Pascal (unit)|hPa]]; 26.35&amp;nbsp;[[inHg]]); it is also the strongest hurricane on record to strike the United States. Out of the ten most intense landfalling United States hurricanes, four struck Florida at peak strength.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

==Florida major hurricanes==

The following [[Tropical cyclone scales|major hurricanes]] either made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the state as a major hurricane or brought winds of [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale|Category 3]] status to the state. For storms that made landfall twice or more, the maximum sustained wind speed, and hence the highest Saffir-Simpson category, at the strongest landfall is listed. Only the landfalls at major hurricane intensity are listed. A * indicates that the storm made landfall outside Florida, but brought winds of major hurricane intensity to part of the state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4384">This is a '''list of [[rivers]] in [[Bulgaria]]'''.

The longest river that Bulgaria has a '''bank''' on is the [[Danube]] (2,888 km), which spans most of the country's northern border. The longest one to run '''through''' the country (and also the deepest) is the [[Maritsa]] (480 km), while the longest river that runs '''solely''' in Bulgaria is the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]] (368 km).

==Regions==
[[File:Bulgaria drainage divide.svg|thumb|250px|Map of drainage regions and drainage divide in Bulgaria]]
A country rich in water resources, Bulgaria has a large number of rivers that are divided into several regions based on their mouth's location. 

Rivers of northern Bulgaria, with the exception of the very east of the region, are typically tributaries of the [[Danube]]. Notable rivers in the area are the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]], [[Vit]], [[Ogosta]], [[Osam]] and [[Yantra River|Yantra]].

The rivers in the eastern part of the country are typically short (except for [[Kamchiya]]) and flow into the [[Black Sea]]. Notable rivers in the region include the [[Kamchiya]], [[Batova]], [[Provadiya River|Provadiyska]], [[Devnenska]], [[Ropotamo]], [[Veleka]] and [[Rezovska]].

Most of the rivers that rise in southern Bulgaria have their mouths in the [[Aegean Sea]] outside Bulgarian territory. A notable exception is the Iskar that takes its source from [[Rila]] and runs through [[Stara Planina]] forming a gorge to reach the Danube. Depending on their location, they are divided into two regions, a Western Aegean and Eastern Aegean one. The former embraces the [[Struma River|Struma]] and [[Mesta River|Mesta]], while rivers in the latter include the [[Arda (Maritsa)|Arda]], [[Maritsa]] and [[Tundzha]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2873">The '''Lower Guinean forests''' is region of coastal [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] in [[West Africa]], extending along the eastern coast of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] from eastern [[Benin]] through [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].

The [[Dahomey Gap]], a region of savanna and dry forest in [[Togo]] and [[Benin]], divides the Lower Guinean forests from the [[Upper Guinean forests]] to the west, which extend along the western coast of the Gulf of Guinea from Togo to [[Liberia]] and north to [[Guinea]].

To the north and northeast, the Lower Guinean forests transition to the drier inland [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] and [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]] and to the south by the Congolian Coastal forests. To the east, the Lower Guinean forests adjoin the vast [[Coastal Congolian forests]] of the [[Congo Basin]], and to the southeast, the Lower Guinean forests are bounded by the [[Western Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]].

The Lower Guinean forests share many biotic affinities with both the Upper Guinean forests. They are collectively known as the [[Guinean Forests of West Africa]].

==Ecoregions==
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) divides the Lower Guinean forests into a number of distinct [[ecoregion]]s:

* [[Nigerian lowland forests]] (Togo, Nigeria)
* [[Niger Delta swamp forests]] (Nigeria)
* [[Cross-Niger transition forests]] (Nigeria)
* [[Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests]] (Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea)
* [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] (Nigeria, Cameroon)
* [[Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests]] (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea)
* [[São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón moist lowland forests]] (Equatorial Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe)
* [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Cabinda (Angola) and Democratic Republic of the Congo)

The WWF has designated two regions of the Lower Guinean forests as [[Global 200]] priority regions for conservation. The WWF's "Coastal Congolian forests" region includes the Cross-Sanaga Bioko coastal forests, São Tomé and Príncipe moist lowland forests, and Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests ecoregions. The "Cameroon Highlands forests" Global 200 region includes the Cameroonian Highlands forests and the Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests ecoregions.

Margham also has an oil production capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/oil-in-dubai-history-timeline-1.578333|title=Oil in Dubai: History &amp; timeline|last=archives|first=Gulf News|date=2010-02-04|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production at Margham commenced in 1984, with three major gas-bearing formations located up to 10,000 feet below sea level. The field is connected by pipeline to Jebel Ali, where the gas condensate is loaded onto tankers for export. Dry gas is now also sent by pipeline to supply the Dubai grid, with consumption increasing since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icis.com/resources/news/2018/01/10/10181701/uae-bets-on-alternative-energy-local-gas-production/|title=UAE bets on alternative energy, local gas production|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This usage, together with sustainables such as DEWA's [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park]], means that Dubai has eliminated the use of oil as a domestic energy fuel.

Although it is a major producer with ambitions to develop its trading activities to become a major global LNG hub, the UAE is actually a net importer of LNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/business/dubai-supply-authority-agrees-deal-with-japan-s-jera-to-explore-lng-opportunities-1.19125|title=Dubai Supply Authority agrees deal with Japan’s Jera to explore LNG opportunities|work=The National|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth poster.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Structure of the Earth. The mesosphere is labeled as ''Stiffer mantle'' in this diagram.]]
In geology, the '''mesosphere''' refers to the part of the Earth's [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] below the [[lithosphere]] and the [[asthenosphere]], but above the [[outer core]]. The upper boundary is defined by the sharp increase in [[seismic wave]] velocities and [[density]] at a depth of {{convert|660|km|mi|0|round=5|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=Condie&gt;{{cite book |author=Condie, Kent C. |date=2001 |title='Mantle Plumes and Their Record in Earth History |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |pages=3&amp;ndash;10 |isbn=0-521-01472-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a depth of 660&amp;nbsp;km, [[ringwoodite]] (gamma-(Mg,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) decomposes into [[silicate perovskite|Mg-Si perovskite]] and [[magnesiowüstite]].&lt;ref name=Condie/&gt; This reaction marks the boundary between upper mantle and lower mantle. This measurement is estimated from seismic data and high-pressure laboratory experiments.

The base of the mesosphere includes the [[D double-prime|D'{{'}}]] zone which lies just above the [[Core–mantle boundary|mantle-core boundary]] at approximately {{convert|abbr=on|2700|to|2890|km|mi|0|round=5}}. The base of the lower mantle is at about 2700&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Condie/&gt;

"Mesosphere" (not to be confused with [[mesosphere]], a layer of the [[atmosphere]]) is derived from “mesospheric shell”, coined by [[Reginald Aldworth Daly]], a [[Harvard University]] [[geology]] professor. In the pre-[[plate tectonics]] era, Daly (1940) inferred that the outer Earth consisted of three [[Sphere|spherical]] layers: lithosphere (including the [[Crust (geology)|crust]]), asthenosphere, and mesospheric shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daly |first=Reginald Aldworth |date=1940 |title=Strength and Structure of the Earth |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daly’s hypothetical depths to the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary ranged from {{convert|abbr=on|80|to|100|km|mi|0}}, and the top of the mesospheric shell (base of the asthenosphere) were from {{convert|abbr=on|200|to|480|km|mi|0|round=5}}. Thus, Daly’s asthenosphere was inferred to be {{convert|abbr=on|120|to|400|km|mi|0|round=5}} thick. According to Daly, the base of the solid Earth mesosphere could extend to the base of the mantle (and, thus, to the top of the [[Structure of the Earth#Core|core]]).

A derivative term, [[mesoplates]], was introduced as a [[heuristic]], based on a combination of "mesosphere" and "plate", for postulated reference frames in which mantle [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] apparently exist.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''Mount Bongao''' (famously known as '''Bud Bongao''') is a mountain located in [[Bongao]] Island in the province of [[Tawi-Tawi]]. It is a mountain formed with six limestone pillars that serves as its 6 peaks. 

Bud Bongao is inside the ''Bongao Peak Eco-Tourism Park'' which was inaugurated last July 3, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARMM spent P56 million to boost Bongao Peak tourism|url=http://www.armm-info.com/2017/07/armm-spent-p56-million-to-boost-bongao-peak-tourism.html|website=Bureau of Public Information, ARMM Government|date=5 July 2017|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 250-hectare forest that is one of the last remaining moist forest in the [[Sulu Archipelago]].&lt;ref name="rappler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yan|first1=Gregg|title=Bud Bongao: The sacred mountain of Tawi-Tawi|url=https://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/56279-bud-bongao-sacred-mountain-tawi-tawi|accessdate=16 October 2017|agency=Rappler|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountain is [[Sacred mountains|considered sacred]] where it is believed that two preachers&lt;ref name="schadow1" /&gt; who are direct followers of [[Makhdum Karim|Karim ul-Makhdum]], are buried under what is called ''Tampat Rocks''&lt;ref name="rappler" /&gt;. Karim ul-Makhdum brought [[Islam]] to the [[Philippines]] in the year 1380.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jannaral|first1=Julmunir|title=ARMM commemorates 636th Sheikh Karimul Makhdum Day|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/armm-commemorates-636th-sheikh-karimul-makhdum-day/295484/|accessdate=16 October 2017|agency=Manila Times|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
Bud Bongao is  composed of six limestone pillars that form six of its peaks, which serves as view points for the islands and locations they are named after.&lt;ref name="schadow1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malicdem|first1=Ervin|title=Bud Bongao, Tawi-Tawi's Overwatch and Sacred Peak|url=http://www.s1expeditions.com/2017/06/214-bud-bongao-tawi-tawi-overwatch.html|website=Schadow1 Expeditions|date=7 June 2017|accessdate=16 October 2017|ref=schadow1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These peaks are ''Bongao'', ''Pajar'', ''Sibutu'' (summit), ''Simunul'', ''Tambisan'', and ''Tinondakan''. &lt;ref name="budbongaodata" /&gt;

==Hiking activity==
Aside from being a sacred mountain, Bud Bongao is also famous for hikers. A 3,608-step cobblestone trail &lt;ref name="schadow1" /&gt; has been constructed from the jump-off at Barangay Pasiagan that ends at a view deck constructed on Tambisan Peak. The view deck offers a vantage point overlooking [[Celebes Sea]] and [[Tambisan Island]] in [[Sabah]] at {{convert|317|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="budbongaodata" /&gt;

==Endemic fauna==
[[Monkey]]s [[endemic]] to Bud Bongao include ''[[Macaca fascicularis]]''. &lt;ref name="schadow1" /&gt;

'''Myco-heterotrophy''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μύκης ''mykes'', "fungus", ἕτερος ''heteros'', "another", "different" and τροφή ''trophe'', "nutrition") is a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship between certain kinds of [[plants]] and [[fungi]], in which the plant gets all or part of its food from [[parasitism]] upon fungi rather than from [[photosynthesis]]. A '''myco-heterotroph''' is the [[parasitic plant]] partner in this relationship. Myco-heterotrophy is considered a kind of [[Cheating (biology)|cheating]] relationship and myco-heterotrophs are sometimes informally referred to as "'''mycorrhizal cheaters'''". This relationship is sometimes referred to as '''mycotrophy''', though this term is also used for plants that engage in [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] [[mycorrhizal]] relationships.

== Relationship between myco-heterotrophs and host fungi ==
[[File:Uniflora-root.jpg|frame|right|Myco-heterotrophic roots of ''[[Monotropa uniflora]]'' with ''[[Russula brevipes]]'' [[mycelium]]]]

Full (or obligate) myco-heterotrophy exists when a non-photosynthetic plant (a plant largely lacking in [[chlorophyll]] or otherwise lacking a functional [[photosystem]]) gets all of its food from the fungi that it parasitizes. Partial (or facultative) myco-heterotrophy exists when a plant is capable of photosynthesis, but parasitizes fungi as a supplementary food supply. There are also plants, such as some [[orchid]] species, that are non-photosynthetic and obligately myco-heterotrophic for part of their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]], and photosynthetic and facultatively myco-heterotrophic or non-myco-heterotrophic for the rest of their life cycle.&lt;ref name="leake94"&gt;Leake JR. 1994. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb04272.x/pdf The biology of myco-heterotrophic ('saprophytic') plants.] ''New Phytologist'' 127: 171–216. {{doi|10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb04272.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all non-photosynthetic or "[[Wiktionary:achlorophyllous|achlorophyllous]]" plants are myco-heterotrophic – some non-photosynthetic plants like [[Cuscuta|dodder]] directly parasitize the [[vascular tissue]] of other plants.&lt;ref name="dawson"&gt;Dawson JH, Musselman LJ, Wolswinkel P, Dörr I. 1994. Biology and control of ''Cuscuta''. ''Reviews of Weed Science'' 6: 265–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, non-photosynthetic plants were mistakenly thought to get food by breaking down [[organic matter]] in a manner similar to [[saprotrophic]] fungi. Such plants were therefore called "[[Saprotroph|saprophytes]]". It is now known that these plants are not physiologically capable of directly breaking down organic matter and that in order to get food, non-photosynthetic plants must engage in parasitism, either through myco-heterotrophy or direct parasitism of other plants.&lt;ref name="bid05"&gt;Bidartondo MI. 2005.

''Mycologist'' 19: 113–122. {{doi|10.1017/S0269915XO5003046}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interface between the plant and fungal partners in this association is between the roots of the plant and the mycelium of the fungus. Myco-heterotrophy therefore closely resembles [[mycorrhiza]] (and indeed is thought to have evolved from mycorrhiza),&lt;ref name="bid05" /&gt; except that in myco-heterotrophy, the flow of carbon is from the fungus to the plant, rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name="trud03"&gt;Trudell SA, Rygiewicz PT, Edmonds RL. 2003.

Most myco-heterotrophs can therefore be seen as ultimately being [[epiparasites]], since they take energy from fungi that in turn get their energy from [[vascular plants]].&lt;ref name="bid05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leake05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sel02"&gt;Selosse M-A, Weiss M, Jany J, Tilier A. 2002.

''Molecular Ecology'' 11: 1831–1844. {{doi|10.1046/j.1365-294X.2002.01553.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, much myco-heterotrophy takes place in the context of common [[mycorrhizal network]]s,&lt;ref name="cn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mykoweb.com/articles/MycorrhizalNetworks.html|title=Common Mycorrhizal Networks: An Important Ecological Phenomenon|author=Peter Kennedy|date=November 2005|publisher=MykoWeb (originally published on ''Mycena News'')|accessdate=January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which plants use mycorrhizal fungi to exchange carbon and nutrients with other plants.&lt;ref name="leake05" /&gt; In these systems, myco-heterotrophs play the role of "mycorrhizal cheaters", taking carbon from the common network, with no known reward.&lt;ref name="bid05" /&gt;

In congruence with older reports, it has been recently shown that some myco-heterotrophic orchids can be supported by saprotrophic fungi, exploiting litter- or wood-decaying fungi.&lt;ref name="martos09"&gt;Martos F, Dulormne M, Pailler T, Bonfante P, Faccio A, Fournel J, Dubois M-P, Selosse M-A. 2009.

==Species diversity of myco-heterotrophs and host fungi==
{{See also|List of myco-heterotrophic genera}}
Myco-heterotrophs are found among a number of plant groups. All [[monotropes]] and non-photosynthetic [[orchids]] are full myco-heterotrophs, as is the non-photosynthetic [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]] ''[[Cryptothallus]]''. Partial myco-heterotrophy is common in the [[Gentian family]], with a few genera such as ''[[Voyria]]'' being fully myco-heterotrophic; in photosynthetic orchids; and in a number of other plant groups. Some [[fern]]s and [[clubmosses]] have myco-heterotrophic [[gametophyte]] stages.&lt;ref name="leake94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leake05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="taylor02"&gt;Taylor DL, Bruns TD, Leake JR, Read DJ. 2002.

Examples of fungi parasitized by myco-heterotrophic plants can be found among the [[ectomycorrhizal]], [[arbuscular mycorrhizal]], and [[orchid mycorrhizal]] fungi.&lt;ref name="imhof09"&gt;Imhof S. 2009.

A '''near-Earth supernova''' is an explosion resulting from the  death of a [[star]] that occurs close enough to the [[Earth]] (roughly less than 10 to 300 parsecs (30 to 1000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s) away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What If History’s Brightest Supernova Exploded In Earth’s Backyard? |author=Joshua Sokol |date=Jan 14, 2016 |work=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/rare-supernova-crab-nebula/424125/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to have noticeable effects on Earth's [[biosphere]].

==Effects on Earth==
On average, a [[supernova]] explosion occurs within {{convert|10|pc|ly|abbr=off}} of the Earth every 240 million years.{{efn|Since a radius of 100 light years contains approximately 27.8 times as much volume as one of 33 light years, a supernova should occur within a radius of 100 light years from Earth approximately once every 8.6 million years.  A supernova would occur within a radius of 200 light years approximately once every million years, within 500 light years every 69,000 years, and within 1,000 light years roughly every 8,625 years.{{Original research inline|date=May 2016}}}} [[Gamma ray]]s are responsible for most of the adverse effects a supernova can have on a living [[terrestrial planet]]. In Earth's case, gamma rays induce a [[chemical reaction]] in the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], converting molecular [[nitrogen]] into [[nitrogen oxide]]s, depleting the [[ozone layer]] enough to expose the surface to harmful [[solar radiation|solar]] and [[cosmic radiation]] (mainly ultra-violet). [[Phytoplankton]] and [[Coral Reef|reef]] communities would be particularly affected, which could severely deplete the base of the marine food chain.&lt;ref name="ellis93"&gt;

==Risk by supernova type==
Speculation as to the effects of a nearby supernova on Earth often focuses on large stars as [[Type II supernova]] candidates. Several prominent stars within a few hundred light years of the Sun are candidates for becoming supernovae in as little as a millennium. Although they would be spectacular to look at, were these "predictable" supernovae to occur, they are thought to have little potential to affect Earth.

It is estimated that a Type&amp;nbsp;II supernova closer than eight [[parsec]]s (26&amp;nbsp;light-years) would destroy more than half of the Earth's ozone layer.&lt;ref name=Gehrels&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such estimates are based on atmospheric modeling and the measured radiation flux from [[SN 1987A]], a Type&amp;nbsp;II supernova in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. Estimates of the rate of supernova occurrence within 10&amp;nbsp;parsecs of the Earth vary from 0.05–0.5 per [[Gigayear|Ga]]&lt;ref name=Whitten1976/&gt; to 10 per Ga.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies assume that supernovae are concentrated in the spiral arms of the galaxy, and that supernova explosions near the Sun usually occur during the ~10 million years that the Sun takes to pass through one of these regions.&lt;ref name=Gehrels/&gt; Examples of relatively near supernovae are the [[Vela Supernova Remnant]] (~800 ly, ~12,000 years ago) and [[Geminga]] (~550 ly, ~300,000 years ago).

[[Type Ia supernova]]e are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because Type&amp;nbsp;Ia supernovae arise from dim, common [[white dwarf]] stars, it is likely that a supernova that could affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and take place in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is [[IK Pegasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Evidence from daughter products of short-lived [[radioactive isotope]]s shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the [[Solar System]] 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-three atoms of this iron isotope were found in the top 2&amp;nbsp;cm of crust (this layer corresponds to times from 13.4 to 0 million years ago).&lt;ref name="Fields"/&gt; It is estimated that the supernova must have occurred in the last 5 million years or else it would have had to happen very close to the solar system to account for so much iron-60 still being here. A supernova occurring so close would have probably caused a mass extinction, which did not happen in that time frame.&lt;ref&gt;Fields &amp; Ellis, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity of iron seems to indicate that the supernova was less than 30 parsecs away. On the other hand, the authors estimate the frequency of supernovae at a distance less than ''D'' (for reasonably small ''D'') as around (''D''/10 [[parsec|pc]])&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per [[annum|Ga]], which gives a probability of only around 5% for a supernova within 30 pc in the last 5 million years. They point out that the probability may be higher because the Solar System is entering the [[Orion Arm]] of the Milky Way.

[[Gamma ray burst]]s from "dangerously close" supernova explosions occur two or more times per billion years, and this has been proposed as the cause of the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events|end Ordovician extinction]], which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;

The flux of gamma rays and x-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 660 ly). If so, this is an unexpected  event because supernovae less than 200 parsecs away are estimated to occur less than once per 100,000 years.&lt;ref name="Fields" /&gt;

Species use restricted [[ecological niche]]s, and the niches of all species are '''segregated''', often with much overlap, by the use of different habitats, different geographic areas and seasons, and different food resources, to mention only a few of the many niche dimensions. The causes of niche restriction and segregation are important problems in evolutionary ecology.

==Background==
Two ecological paradigms deal with the problem. The first paradigm predominates in what may be called “classical” ecology. It assumes that niche space is largely saturated with individuals and species, leading to strong competition. Niches are restricted because “neighbouring” species, i.e., species with similar ecological characteristics such as similar habitats or food preferences, prevent expansion into other niches or even narrow niches down. This continual struggle for existence is an important assumption of [[natural selection]] introduced by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as an explanation for evolution.

The other paradigm assumes that niche space is to a large degree vacant, i.e., that there are many [[vacant niches]]. It is based on many empirical studies &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1980. Warum sind ökologische Nischen begrenzt?  Zwischenartlicher Antagonismus oder innerartlicher Zusammenhalt?  Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 33, 98-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 2005a. Eine neue Ökologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolutionären Ökologie. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"&gt;K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553&lt;/ref&gt; and theoretical investigations especially of Kauffman 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, S.A. 1993. The origins of order. Self-organization and selection in evolution. Oxford University Press, New York Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of vacant niches may be evolutionary contingencies or brief or long-lasting environmental disturbances.

Both paradigms agree that species are never “universal” in the sense that they occupy all possible niches; they are always specialized, although the degree of specialization varies. For example, there is no universal parasite which infects all host species and microhabitats within or on them. However, the degree of host specificity varies strongly. Thus, ''Toxoplasma'' (Protista) infects numerous vertebrates including humans, ''Enterobius vermicularis'' infects only humans.

The following mechanisms for niche restriction and segregation have been proposed:

== Niche restriction ==

# Species must be specialized in order to survive. They may survive for a while in less optimal habitats under favourable conditions, but they will be extinguished when conditions become less favourable, for example due to changed weather conditions (this aspect was especially emphasized by Price 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Price, P. W. 1983. Communities of specialists: vacant niches in ecological and evolutionary time. In Strong, D., Simberloff, D. and Abele, L. Eds.. Ecological Communities: Conceptual Issues and the Evidence. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Niches remain narrow or become narrower as the result of natural selection in order to enhance the chances of mating. This “mating theory of niche restriction” &lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1977. A non-competitive mechanism responsible for restricting niches.  Zoologischer Anzeiger 199, 164-172.&lt;/ref&gt; is supported by the observation that niches of asexual stages are often wider than those of sexually mature stages; that niches become narrower at the time of mating; and that microhabitats of sessile species and of species with small population sizes often are narrower than those of non-sessile species and of species with large population sizes.

== Niche segregation ==

# The random selection of niches in largely empty niche space will often automatically lead to segregation (this mechanism is of particular importance in the second paradigm).
# Niches are segregated due to interspecific competition (this mechanism is of particular importance in the first paradigm).
# Niches of similar species are segregated (as the result of natural selection) in order to prevent interspecific hybridisation, because hybrids are less fit. (Many cases of niche segregation explained by interspecific competition are better explained by this mechanism, i.e., “[[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement of reproductive barriers]]”) (e.g., Rohde 2005b).&lt;ref name="Nonequilibrium Ecology(1992)"/&gt;

==Relative significance of the mechanisms==

Both paradigms acknowledge a role for all mechanisms (except possibly for that of random selection of niches in the first paradigm), but emphasis on the various mechanisms varies. The first paradigm stresses the paramount importance of interspecific competition, whereas the second paradigm tries to explain many cases which are thought to be due to competition in the first paradigm, by reinforcement of reproductive barriers and/or random selection of niches. – Many authors believe in the overriding importance of interspecific competition. Intuitively, one would expect that [[interspecific competition]] is of particular importance in all those cases in which sympatric species (i.e., species occurring together in the same area) with large population densities use the same resources and largely exhaust them. However, Andrewartha and Birch (1954,1984)&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha,H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1954. The distribution and abundance of animals. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrewartha, H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1984. The ecological web. University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have pointed out that most natural populations usually don’t even approach exhaustion of resources, and too much emphasis on interspecific competition is therefore wrong. Concerning the possibility that competition has led to segregation in the evolutionary past, Wiens (1974, 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1974. Habitat heterogeneity and avian community structure in North American grasslands. American Midland Naturalist 91,195-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1984. Resource systems, populations, and communities. In: Price, P.W., Slobodchikoff, C.N. and Gaud, W.S. Eds. A new ecology. Novel approaches to interactive systems. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore, pp. 397-436.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that such assumptions cannot be proven, and Connell (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Connell, J.H. 1980. Diversity and the coevolution of competitors, or the ghost of competition past. Oikos 35, 131-138.&lt;/ref&gt; found that interspecific competition as a mechanism of niche segregation has been proven only for some pest insects. Barker (1983),&lt;ref&gt;Barker, J.S.F. 1983. Interspecific competition. In: Ashburner, M., Carson, H.L. and Thompson, jr., J.N. Ed. The genetics and biology of Drosophila. Academic Press, London, pp. 285-341.&lt;/ref&gt; in his review of competition in ''Drosophila'' and related genera, which are among the best known animal groups, concluded that the idea of niche segregation by interspecific competition is attractive, but that no study has yet been able to show a mechanism responsible for segregation. Without specific evidence, the possibility of random segregation can never be excluded, and assumption of such randomness can indeed serve as a null-model. – Many physiological and morphological differences between species can prevent hybridization. Evidence for niche segregation as the result of reinforcement of reproductive barriers is especially convincing in those cases in which such differences are not found in allopatric but only in sympatric locations. For example, Kawano (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Kawano, K. 2002. Character displacement in giant rhinoceros beetles. American Naturalist 159, 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown this for giant rhinoceros beetles in Southeast Asia. Two closely related species occur in 12 allopatric (i.e., in different areas) and 7 sympatric (i.e., in the same area) locations. In the former, body length and length of genitalia are practically identical, in the latter, they are significantly different, and much more so for the genitalia than the body, convincing evidence that reinforcement is an important factor (and possibly the only one) responsible for niche segregation. - The very detailed studies of communities of Monogenea parasitic on the gills of marine and freshwater fishes by several authors have shown the same. Species use strictly defined microhabitats and have very complex copulatory organs.  This and the fact that fish replicas are available in almost unlimited numbers, makes them ideal ecological models.  Many congeners (species belonging to the same genus) and non-congeners were found on single host species. The maximum number of congeners was nine species. The only limiting factor is space for attachment, since food (blood, mucus, fast regenerating epithelial cells) is in unlimited supply as long as the fish is alive. Various authors, using a variety of statistical methods, have consistently found that species with different copulatory organs may co-occur in the same microhabitat, whereas congeners with identical or very similar copulatory organs are spatially segregated, convincing evidence that reinforcement and not competition is responsible for niche segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1991. Intra- and interspecific interactions in low density populations in resource-rich habitats.  Oikos 60, 91-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. 1994.

'''Pauline Neura Reilly''' [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (5 December 1918 – 22 April 2011) was an Australian author and [[ornithologist]].

==Early years==
Reilly was born (as Pauline Duncan) in [[Adelaide]].  Her family moved to [[Melbourne]] where she attended [[Korowa Anglican Girls' School]] and [[Melbourne Girls Grammar School]] until 1934. Before the [[Second World War]] she worked as a secretary, then served from 1942 to 1944 as a gunner in the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]], as well as working for [[Australian Army Intelligence Corps|Australian Army Intelligence]].  She married Arthur Reilly in 1943.

==Ornithology==
Reilly joined the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]] (RAOU) in 1956, which she served as Publicity Officer 1966–1967, on the Field Investigations Committee 1969–1972, as President 1972–1975, and as the Chair of the Atlas Committee 1976–1982.  From 1969 to 1970 she was President of the [[Australian Bird Study Association|Bird Banders' Association of Australia]].  From 1964 to 1981 she was the Honorary Regional Victorian Organiser of the [[Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme]].  One of her main achievements with the RAOU was the instigation, leadership and successful conclusion of the RAOU's first [[Atlas of Australian Birds]] project, fieldwork for which ran from 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1981.

Reilly was actively involved in ornithological fieldwork for many years, especially in studies of [[little penguin]]s. In 1968 she founded the Penguin Study Group of the [[Victorian Ornithological Research Group]].  In 1973 she led an expedition to the [[Great Australian Bight]] to carry out penguin research.  In 1978–79 she became the first woman to spend the summer research season on subantarctic [[Macquarie Island]] to [[bird ringing|band]] penguins.  She was invited to open the Second International Penguin Conference in August 1992.

In later years Reilly moved to [[Aireys Inlet, Victoria|Aireys Inlet]] on the Victorian coast where she concentrated on writing a series of scientifically accurate [[children's literature|children's books]] about Australian birds and other animals, mainly illustrated first by Will Rolland and later by Kaylene Traynor.

[[File:Scotland Dunadd 1.jpg|thumb|This footprint (replica&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.heraldscotland.com/revealed-carved-footprint-marking-scotland-s-birth-is-a-replica-1.827928 Revealed: carved footprint marking Scotland's birth is a replica]'', The Herald, 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;) carved into the rock on [[Dunadd]], in [[Argyll]], is linked to the crowning of the Scots kings of [[Dál Riata]].]]
A '''petrosomatoglyph''' is a supposed image of parts of a human or animal body in rock.
They occur all over the world, often functioning as   an important form of symbolism, used in religious and secular ceremonies, such as the crowning of kings. Some are regarded as artefacts linked to [[saints]] or [[culture hero]]es.

The word comes from the Greek ''πέτρα&amp;nbsp;– petra'' ("stone"), ''σῶμα&amp;nbsp;– soma'' ("body"), and ''γλύφειν&amp;nbsp;– glyphein'' ("to carve"). Feet are the most common; however, knees, elbows, hands, head, fingers, etc., are also found.

Stylised representations of parts of the body are often open to dispute and are therefore on the fringes of acceptability as identifiable petrosomatoglyphs. Natural objects, such as rock crystals and rock formations which look like petrosomatoglyphs, whole animals, plants, etc., are collectively called "mimeoliths".

==Natural versus man-made petrosomatoglyphs==
Many examples of petrosomatoglyphs are likely to be natural in origin, such as [[rock-cut basin]]s in rivers; however they still have relevance as they have often become associated with Saints, legendary figures, fairies, etc.

Feet are the most common; however, knees, mythological heroes, saints, etc. Some may be man-made but have become a petrosomatoglyph by the original function being forgotten.

A typical example of a possibly re-used concavity is the footprint on [[Dunadd]] which some locals at one time thought was a cast for a bronze axe head.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;[[F. W. L. Thomas|Thomas, F.W.L.]] &amp; Scot, S.A. (1878–79). ''Dunadd, Glassary, Argyllshire''. Proc Soc Antiq. Scot. Vol. 1. - New Series. Pps. 28–47.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[pseudofossil]] of an apparent footprint of a human foot wearing a sandal with a [[trilobite]] fossil in the print has been quoted by anti-evolutionists to show that modern man did walk the earth at this time, around five hundred million years ago. The Burdick Print&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo.cc/paluxy/wilker6.htm |title=The Burdick Print |publisher=Paleo.cc |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or Burdick Track) from [[Glen Rose, Texas]], USA, is claimed by some [[creationists]] to be part of a "giant man track", walking alongside dinosaurs.

==Animal petrosomatoglyphs==

===Dogs===
In the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', the story is told of Culhwch and Olwen, and part of this relates to the hunting by [[King Arthur]] and his knights of the wild boar Twrch Trwyth&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;Jones, G. &amp; Jones, T. (1973). ''The Mabinogion''. Everyman Library. {{ISBN|0-460-00097-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; with dogs. Cefn Carn Cafall (the ridge of Cafall's cairn) is a mountain near Builth in Breconshire where the footprint of King Arthur's favourite hunting dog, Cafall, is located in a conglomerate boulder on top of the cairn. If taken away, the boulder always mysteriously returns to its position on the cairn.&lt;ref name="Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain"&gt;Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain. (1973).

===Horses===
'''''In Europe: Wales and Cornwall''''' Royal and other horses were sacred to [[Epona]], the horse-goddess. Near Castell Cilan in Gwynedd, North Wales, is a stone embedded in the ground bearing the hoof-print of [[Einion Frenin|King Einion]]'s horse.&lt;ref name=sabi&gt;Baring-Gould, Sabine &amp;&amp;nbsp;al. [https://archive.org/stream/livesofbritishsa02bariuoft#page/422/mode/2up ''The Lives of the British Saints: The Saints of Wales and Cornwall and Such Irish Saints as Have Dedications in Britain'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;II, pp.&amp;nbsp;422&amp;nbsp;ff]. Chas. Clark (London), 1908. Hosted at Archive.org. Accessed 18 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At Llanllyfni in Wales is the hoof-print of the horse of St. Gredfyw.&lt;ref name="Pennick199641"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Close to Llyn Barfog in Wales is a hoof-print&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; etched deep into the rock "Carn March Arthur", or the "Stone of Arthur's Horse", which was supposedly made by King Arthur's mount, [[Llamrai]], when it was hauling the terrible [[Addanc]], or "afanc" monster, from the lake. At the Creiqiau Tylwch near Llangurig [[Oliver Cromwell]] is said to have ridden his horse over the precipitous rocks and left behind a hoof print.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyparishll00lloygoog/historyparishll00lloygoog_djvu.txt Llangurig Parish] Retrieved : 2012-09-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Not far from the Devil's [[Dolmen|Quoit]] in [[St Columb Major|St. Columb]], on the edge of Goss Moor in Cornwall, is a large stone with four deeply impressed marks, known as "King Arthur's Stone". The marks are said to be footprints made by the horse upon which Arthur rode when he resided at [[Castle an Dinas, St Columb|Castle an Dinas]] and hunted on the moors.&lt;ref name="Ralls-MacLeod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/concepts/folkgazt.htm| title=A Gazetteer of Arthurian Topographic Folklore| accessdate=2006-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Welsh legend has [[King Arthur]] pursuing [[Morgan le Fay]], who turns herself into a stone. Arthur's steed leaps across the [[Bristol Channel]], leaving its hoof-prints on a rock.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie"/&gt;

'''''In Europe: Scotland''''' At Loch Loran in Kilmichael, Argyll and [[Isle of Bute|Bute]], are five flat stones bearing what may be natural markings improved by light pecking.

'''''In Europe: England''''' At [[Tedstone Delamere]] in [[Herefordshire]], England, the Sapey Brook runs its course to Upper Sapey. A mare and a colt had been stolen, and the hoof-prints stopped at the bank of the brook. The owner prayed for their safe return and, upon examining the bed of the brook, saw hoof-prints clearly visible in the rocky bottom. These hoof-prints were followed and, the thief caught, the horses being safely recovered. The nearby Hoar Stone is said to be the horse thief petrified for his crimes.

'''''In Asia''''' A winged horse named El-Buraq, which had the face and breasts of a woman and the tail of a peacock, was tethered for a period of time on the Rock, or foundation stone of the Holy Jewish Temple in [[Israel]], leaving a hoof-print on the Rock. It is said that the hoof print of Muhammad's steed, El Burak, from which he was propelled to heaven, can be seen imprinted in the [[Foundation Stone]] in Jerusalem.

'''''Cattle'''''  At [[South Lopham]] in [[Norfolk]], England is the Ox-Foot Stone, which previously lay in a meadow still known as the Oxfoot Piece, and bears the supposed imprint of an ox's foot. The legend goes that in a time of great famine, a miraculous cow appeared and provided a never-ending supply of milk to the starving poor. When the famine ceased, the cow struck its hoof against the stone leaving the imprint and then vanished. The stone itself is a flattish slab of sandstone about 60&amp;nbsp;cm x 90&amp;nbsp;cm, likely deposited during the last [[ice age]] as a [[Glacial erratic]], and the 'hoofprint' is probably the imprint of a fossil [[bivalve]]. This part of [[East Anglia]] has virtually no naturally occurring stone (local geology being [[boulder clay]] with flints overlaid on chalk), so the Stone's very existence would have been notable. The stone now stands outside the door of Oxfootstone Farm House.&lt;ref name="Westwood"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub. Grafton Books.

==Mythical and folkloric beings==

===Fairies===
At Loch Loran in Kilmichael, [[Argyll and Bute]], are five flat stones bearing what may be natural markings improved by light pecking. They lie under water near the inlet at the northern end of the loch and can be best seen in dry weather. Two of the markings are called the "Fairy Footprints", being 11" overall, close together, with narrow heels which point across the loch. The left foot has possibly artificially added toes. Close behind are two ovals and several ''V''-hollows suggesting large hoof-prints.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS1964"/&gt; They were not located on a visit in 1970.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} On Wangan Island, one of the [[Penghu]] group between China and [[Taiwan]], are a group of fairy footprints on the top of Tiantai hill. In the very remote Pony Hills, New Mexico, near the desert border with Mexico, are examples of shamanic rock art. The site is located around a spring-fed rock pool. The images depict a variety of spirit forms and also tiny carved footprints—the trail of Water Baby spirits trekking from one pool to another.

===The devil===
At the ruined Kirk of Lady, near Overbister on [[Sanday, Orkney]], are the Devil's Fingermarks, incised as parallel grooves into the parapet of the kirk.&lt;ref name="Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain"/&gt; In [[North Kingstown]] is a large, granite ledge known as Devil's Foot Rock. Legends going back to the colonial era tell of a Native woman being chased by the devil. Some say that she fled from Boston. Her pursuer is said to have left his footprints at Devil's Foot Rock, then at Chimney Hill in South Kingstown, and finally at Block Island.

At Dol de Bretagne in [[Brittany]] are found the claw mark of the devil on Mont Dol as well as the footprints of [[St. Michael]]. Near [[Holmfirth]] in [[Yorkshire]], the devil left his footprints as scorch marks on Netherton Edge. One day, the devil disguised himself as a [[druid]] in an attempt to gain favour with the old priests but was discovered in his plans and so, in anger, flew out across the hills carrying a great stone with him, which he dropped from the skies, and it landed where the Hood Hill Stone still remains. Also, in anger, he jumped down and stood on the great rock and in doing so, left his footprint impressed upon the stone. The site is at Kilburn, [[Northallerton]], in [[Yorkshire]]. In Lancashire, the devil threw stones at [[Clitheroe]] Castle and left his footprints in Deerstones Quarry near Pendle. At Castle [[Bentheim Castle|Bentheim]] in Germany, there is a curious smooth rock that the devil used as a pillow, leaving behind an imprint of his ear. In [[Cologne]], on a heavy stone called Teufelsstein, are imprinted the hands and talons of the devil. The Lugenstein in the cathedral square at [[Halberstadt]] was carried there by the devil to destroy the cathedral. It was too heavy, and he dropped it, leaving behind an imprint of his red hot thumb.

Sir Fergus Barclay, also known as the De'il of [[Ardrossan]], was a horseman, famous around the lands for his tremendous skill. The secret to his skill, however, was a magical bridle, which was given to Barclay by the devil, in exchange for his soul. However, the devil was tricked by Barclay into giving his soul back. Infuriated by this trickery, the devil attacked the castle in his rage and is said to have left his hoof prints on one of the rocks.

The 'Packstone' is a huge whinstone block to be found at the farm of that name near Muirhead, [[Shotts]]. The story goes that the magician [[Michael Scot]] had relatives in the area and he employed the devil to build a bridge across the [[Firth of Forth]] at [[South Queensferry]] however he fell out with his builder and the devil threw down the 'pack' he was carrying and the marks of his shoulders are still to be seen on the stone.&lt;ref&gt;Grossart, William (1880), ''History of the Parish of Shotts''. Glasgow. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eastern wall of the church of [[Pancras of Rome|Saint Pancras]] in the ancient monastery of [[Saint Augustine]] outside Canterbury is to be seen the imprint of the devil's talons as he was furious that his heathen temple had become a Christian place of worship.&lt;ref name="Wall"/&gt; On a coping stone of the Devil's Bridge at [[Kirkby Lonsdale]] in Cumbria are the fingermarks of the devil left behind when in his fury at being tricked out of a soul.&lt;ref name="Westwood17"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion.

[[File:Teufelsschritt Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|left|The Devil's Footstep in the [[Munich Frauenkirche]].]]
At the entrance to the [[Munich Frauenkirche]] church in [[Bavaria]] is located the Devil's Footstep or ''Teufelsschritt.'' This mark in a tile resembles a footprint, which according to legend was where the [[devil]] stood after he had made a deal with the builder to finance construction of the church on the condition that it contain no windows. The builder managed to trick the devil by siting columns so that the windows were not visible from the spot where the devil stood at the entrance. The devil eventually worked out that he had been tricked, however he could not enter a consecrated church and could only stand in the entrance foyer, stamping his foot furiously, leaving the footprint that remains visible in the church's entrance today.

Legend also says the devil then rushed outside and manifested its evil spirit in the wind that furiously rages around the church.&lt;ref name="destination"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frauenkirche| url=http://www.destination-munich.com/frauenkirche.html| publisher= Destination Munich| year=2011| accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giants===
On a natural stone in Cornwall is a foot-shaped impression in a rock in the valley leading to the cliffs and coastal footpath near Chapel Porth. It is said to be the foot mark of [[Giant Bolster]] of [[St Agnes, Cornwall|St Agnes]] legend. Just below the formation, there used to be a Holy Well dedicated to St Agnes, but it dried up due to the mining in the area. Footprints at North Yell, up Hena, in Shetland were thought to be lost&lt;ref name="Breeze1997"&gt;Breeze, David &amp; Munro, Graeme (1997). ''The Stone of Destiny. Symbol of Nationhood''. Historic Scotland. {{ISBN|1-900168-44-8}}. Pps. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt; but were rediscovered in 1969 by the ordnance survey. The footprint, 12" by 4", is known locally as the "Wartie" and was used to wash in dew or rainwater, and standing in it was supposed to get rid of warts. In legend, it was made by a giant placing one foot here and the other on the Westing of [[Unst]]. In Bristol, the giants Vincent and Goram dug the Avon gorge and left their footprints. Moso's Footprint in [[Samoa]] was made when the giant Moso stepped over to Samoa from [[Fiji]], and the other footprint can be found on Viti Levu of Fiji. It is a 1&amp;nbsp;m by 3&amp;nbsp;m rock enclosure. At the foot of the Doa mountain in Vietnam, towards the west, is a big rock. There are two human footprints on the rock. It is said that the footprints belonged to a giant who used to help the villagers with the construction of their houses. One of the footprints has been damaged. At [[Arthur's Stone, Herefordshire|Arthur's Stone]] chambered tomb in Herefordshire is a "cup mark" stone which bears the imprints of a giant's (or king's) elbow, left behind after he fell dead to the ground, killed by King Arthur.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"&gt;Bord, Janet and Colin (1988).

==Religious leaders, patriarchs and saints==

===Adam===
The ''Sri Pada'' footprint in the rock atop [[Adam's Peak]], [[Sri Lanka]] is attributed to [[Adam]] by Christians and Muslims.

===Abraham===
The ''Maqām Ibrāhīm'' ("Abraham's place of standing") is a rock kept in a crystal dome next to the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] in Mecca. The footprint in it is believed, by Muslim tradition, to have been made by [[Islamic view of Abraham|Abraham]] when he was lifting stone blocks to build the Ka'bah.

===Archangel Gabriel===
In Islamic tradition, the [[Foundation Stone]] is where Muhammad ascended to heaven, and during this ascension, the rock itself started to rise at the southern end but was held down by the Archangel Gabriel, and some marks on the western side of the rock are said to be the fingerprints of Gabriel.

===The Buddha===

Buddhist legend holds that during his lifetime the Buddha flew to Sri Lanka and left his footprint on [[Adam's Peak]] to indicate the importance of Sri Lanka as the perpetuator of his teachings, and also left footprints in all lands where his teachings would be acknowledged.&lt;ref name=Stratton_301/&gt; In [[Thailand]], the most important of these "natural" footprints imbedded in rock is at [[Wat Phra Phutthabat|Phra Phutthabat]] in Central Thailand.&lt;ref name=Stratton_301/&gt; In [[China]], during [[Tang Dynasty]], the discovery of a large footprint of the Buddha in [[Chengzhou]] caused Empress [[Wu Zetian]] to inaugurate a new reign name in that year, 701 CE, starting the Dazu (Big Foot) era.&lt;ref name="Strong_087"/&gt;

===Jesus===
[[File:I piedi del quo vadis.jpg|thumb|According to legend, these impressions are a copy of the footprints of [[Jesus]] at the [[Church of Domine Quo Vadis]], Rome.]]

At the Chapel of the Ascension&lt;ref name="Ascension"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-chapel-of-ascension.htm |title=Chapel of the Ascension |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Jerusalem]], there are a pair of footprints reputed to be those of [[Jesus]] made at the time of his [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] into [[heaven]]. These are sometimes shown in medieval depictions of the [[Ascension of Jesus in Christian art|Ascension in art]].

The church of [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Saint Sebastian Outside the Walls]] in Rome houses a stone which, according to tradition, bears the footprints of Jesus when he appeared to [[Saint Peter]] on the [[Appian Way]]. A copy of these footprints is preserved, as an [[ex voto]] offering, at the [[Church of Domine Quo Vadis]], the chapel marking the traditional spot of Jesus' appearance to Peter.

[[Henry III of England]] was given a piece of white marble which allegedly carried a trace of one of Jesus' feet, which he had left as a souvenir to his [[apostles]] after his Ascension. Henry gave this [[relic]] to [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref Name="Jusserland"&gt;Jusserand, Jean Jules (1888) ''English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages''; trans. L. T. Smith. London: T. Fisher Unwin; p. 327–328&lt;/ref&gt; This may simply have been a votive copy of the footprint in the Chapel of the Ascension.

===Mary, the mother of Jesus===
In [[Wales]], the knees and breasts of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] are said to be imprinted on a rock beside her well at Ffynnon Fair, [[Llanfair, Gwynedd|Llanfair]], between [[Barmouth]] and [[Harlech]] in [[Gwynedd]]. Marks said to be her footprint and thumb-print are to be found nearby. Two other Mary footprints are recorded in the vicinity at Llan Maria (St. Mary) near [[Llanbedr]], and Wenallt Hill at Llanaber.&lt;ref name="Bord2004"/&gt;

At [[Pochayiv Lavra]] in western [[Ukraine]], there is a footprint which by tradition was left in the stone by the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) after her miraculous [[Marian apparition|appearance]] to two [[monk]]s in the 15th century. A spring of water which is believed to have miraculous powers flows from the footprint to this day.

===Muhammad===
At the Qubbat al-Sanaya (the Dome of the Front Teeth) the mark made by the [[Muhammad]]'s tooth is to be found on a stone in a wall. Muhammad was attacked and lost a tooth during the incident. A mark on a stone wall is said to have been made when the tooth fell. Muhammad's footprints are (by Islamic tradition) found in numerous places, such as the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], in [[Damascus]], and in [[mosques]] in [[West Bengal]], [[Bangladesh]] and Gudjarat.&lt;ref name="Bord2004"&gt;Bord, Janet (2004).

===Rama===
The footprint in the rock at [[Hampi]] is attributed to that of [[Rama]].

===Shiva===
The ''Sri Pada'' footprint in the rock atop [[Adam's Peak]], [[Sri Lanka]] is attributed to that of [[Shiva]] by Hindus (and the Buddha by Buddhists).

===Footprints===
[[File:Columbafootprints.jpg|left|thumb|Footprints of [[Columba|Saint Columba]] at Belmont, Londonderry Road, [[Ireland]]]]

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were accustomed to carve pairs of footprints on a stone with the inscription ''pro itu et reditu'', "for the journey and return".&lt;ref name="Pennick199640"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; They used them for protective rites on leaving for a journey and for thanksgiving for a safe return, when the traveler would place his feet in the footprints to mark the beginning or end of the undertaking. This same story is told of King Maelgwn of [[Gwynedd]] in [[North Wales]], who placed his feet in carved footprints to ensure his safe return from a pilgrimage to Rome.

In northern Europe, rock footprints were closely associated with Kingship or Chieftainship. [[Saxo Grammaticus]] notes that "The ancients, when they came to choose a King, stood on stones planted in the ground to proclaim their votes, signifying from the steadfastness of the stones that the deed would be lasting."

Standing on a special stone is a link between the king and the land from which his people earned their food. Links with King Arthur and "The Sword in the Stone" may be relevant in this context of kingship, a right to power over his subjects and links with nature. A similar idea seems to be associated with the [[Moot hill]], or Boot Hill, at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]], for the latter name comes from an ancient tradition whereby emissaries swore fealty to their king by wearing the earth of their own lands in their foot-bindings or boots.&lt;ref name="Boot"&gt;[http://www.scone-palace.net/palace/moothill.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807151718/http://www.scone-palace.net/palace/moothill.cfm |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper echelons of the clergy of the Celtic Church were drawn from the nobility; indeed, even some kings retired to become monks and eventually even saints, as in the case of [[Constantine of Cornwall|King Constantine]] of [[Cornwall]], who retired to [[Govan]] on the Clyde in Scotland. This meant that the association of stone footprints was also made with the saints, bishops and others.

The poet [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] states that the custom amongst the Irish was to place the man who is to be chief upon a stone, always reserved for that purpose alone and located on a hill. Some of these had a footprint cut into them which was the size and shape of the candidate's. The oath was taken with the foot in the footprint, the individual swearing that as chief he would preserve all the ancient customs and respect the laws of royal inheritance.

A ''Locus terribilis'' is a sacred place into which only a divine or sacred person could enter. Petrosomatoglyph footprints for the ordination of kings would be an example, for it was believed that only the rightful king was able to use them for the purpose that they were intended.&lt;ref name="Pennick134"&gt;Pennick, Nigel (1996). ''Celtic Sacred Landscapes''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-01666-6}}. P. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Footprints may also have to do with the cult of the ancestors, whose spirits dwell in the stone, so that a newly invested King would have received the luck or mana of his predecessors through contact with it.&lt;ref name="Westwood180"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain''. London: Grafton Books. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

Footprints have been found in Sweden, Denmark, Italy, [[Sri Lanka]] (Adam's Foot), and [[Uganda]].

====Footprints in Ireland====
[[File:Markings on a stone of the Cromlech at Arzon, Morbihan, Brittany.jpg|thumb|The footprints and associated markings from [[Arzon]] Cromlech in [[Morbihan]], Brittany]]

Close to St. Olann's Well at Coolineagh, near [[Coachford]], [[County Cork]], are the footprints of St. Olann on a boulder. In the garden of Belmont, on the Greencastle Road, about a mile from Derry, there was, in 1837, a block called St. Columba's Stone with two footprints on it. It may have been the inauguration stone of the Kings of Aileach, brought here by the local Chief of Derry.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; On the [[Clare Hills]] in Ireland, on the Gort to Feakle road in the townland of Drumandoora, is the engraved outline or impression of a foot clothed by a sandal. On the Hill of Lech, or, previously, Mullach Leaght, the "Hill of the Stone", three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Monaghan]] in Ireland, was the inauguration stone of the Mac Mahons. It was used in 1595 and destroyed by a farm owner in 1809.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt;
At [[Clonmacnoise]], [[County Offaly]], Ireland, close to the Chapel of Clonfinlough. there are several limestone boulders, one of which is called the Fairy's or Horseman's Stone.  It has many cup-shaped hollows, crosses, daggers, and a pair of human feet. At [[Templemore]] in [[County Londonderry]] is a slab named St. Columbkille's Stone.  It has the imprint of two feet, each ten inches (254&amp;nbsp;mm) in length. Traditionally, it was the inauguration stone of the ancient Irish chieftains.&lt;ref name="Bord1976"&gt;Bord, Janet &amp; Colin (1976). ''The Secret Country''. Pub. Paul Elek. {{ISBN|0-236-40048-7}}. pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Columba's Stone near Derry has two depressions like the marks of feet. The [[O'Doherty]]'s are said to have stood on this stone with bare feet at their inaugurations.&lt;ref name="Westwood180"/&gt; At Slievenamon (The Mountain of the Women), at South Tipperary in Ireland, is the rock that bears the footprints of Goll—"the One-Eyed"—who made a giant leap across the valley to catch up with the hunt of the Fianna.

====Footprints in Africa====
[[File:Laetoli footprints replica.jpg|thumb|Laetoli footprints replica]]
The [[Laetoli]] footprints are hominid tracks left behind in then-soft volcanic ash nearly 3.7 million years ago. The prints were discovered by [[Mary Leakey]] and others in 1978.

====Footprints in other parts of the world====
[[File:Swedishfootprints.jpg|thumb|These footprints are associated with figures such as ships, shields and people.]]

A set of [[Jesus]]'s footprints, according to legend, are preserved at the [[Church of Domine Quo Vadis]] outside of Rome. In [[Buddhist symbolism]], a ''Buddhapada'' ([[Buddha footprint|footprint]] of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]) with [[Dharmacakra]] and [[Triratna]] symbols from the 1st century is to be found at [[Gandhāra]], Northern Pakistan.

Sweden's rich flora of petroglyphs include many hundred footprints, singles and in pairs.

On [[Sri Pada]], or Adam's Peak, a mountain in [[Sri Lanka]], is a footprint mark said by Buddhists to be that of the left foot of the Buddha, the right footprint being in a city about 150 kilometres distant, or at Phra Sat in [[Thailand]]. [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Hindus]] consider it to be the footprint of [[Shiva]]. Some [[Muslim]]s and Christians ascribe it to [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], where Adam the "first ancestor" is said to have set foot as he was exiled from the [[Garden of Eden]]. Sometimes Christians ascribe it to [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]], the "Apostle of India". Footprints of the Buddha also exist in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Maldives]], Pakistan, [[Singapore]], and [[Burma]]. The St. Victor's Petroglyphs in [[Provincial Park]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]], feature human footprints.

A human-like footprint in volcanic ash was discovered in 1970 during the construction of the [[Demirköprü Dam]] in Turkey. The ash was dated as having been deposited about 250,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnaby|first=Wendy|title=International News 'picture story'|journal=Nature|date=April 17, 1975|volume=254|issue=5501|page=553|doi=10.1038/254553a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knee prints===

[[File:Bullaunchapeltoun.JPG|left|thumb|A Bullaun in [[Chapeltoun]], Ayrshire, Scotland.]]

A tradition of body-part impressions at holy wells, rivers and beneath waterfalls comes from the fact that Celtic monks or [[culdee]]s often prayed in such places, continuing the veneration of the [[Druid]]s for sacred water. Folk belief ascribes healing powers to waters taken from these holy impressions, and this water was used to cure sickness, wounds and sores, as well as preventing or curing sickness in animals such as cattle.&lt;ref name="Pennick1996"/&gt;

At Llangynnlo in Wales are Olgliniau Cynllo, the knee prints of King Cynllo at prayer. At Troedraur in [[Dyfed]], South Wales are the knee-marks of St. Gwyndaf Hen impressed on a flat rock in the bed of the River Ceri.&lt;ref name="Pennick199641"/&gt; These are 'pot holes' or [[Rock-cut basin]]s made by the grinding effect of stone in the river currents to the sceptics. St Cynwyl in the river at [[Caio, Carmarthenshire|Caio]] in Wales. St. Beuno at Llanaelhaiarn in Wales. At Arthur's Stone chambered tomb in Hereford &amp; Worcester is a cup-mark stone which bears the imprints of [[King Arthur]]'s knees left behind after he prayed to God in thanks for victory over a giant (or king) whom he had killed and whose tomb this is.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; At Llanllyfni in Wales are the knee prints of St. Gredfyw.&lt;ref name="Pennick199641"/&gt;

John O'Donovan, in his Ordnance Survey Letters of 1840, tells the story of [[Saint Moling]] crossing a small hill in the [[County Wexford]] district, when an evil spirit annoyed him. He knelt on a rock to curse the spirit, leaving the impression of his knees on the stone. While there is no account of the stone today, it is said that the incident gave the name to the townland Cloch na Mallacht, i.e. "the stones of the curses", linking the episode to [[Bullaun]] stones which often contain cursing stones.

Near [[St Fillan's Kirk, Seat and Well|St Fillan's Kirk]] in [[Renfrewshire]] there is recorded a large flat rock called the 'Kneelins Stane' that had three depressions, two made by the knees of pilgrims and the third made by their staffs.

Near [[Minden]] in the Geismarwald on the Totenberg in Germany, an army leader who before a battle in the [[Thirty Years' War]] declared that he had as much chance of winning as he had of the stone becoming soft. It did, and his foot- and hand-prints are still there to be seen by all.

===Eyes===
At St. Mary's Church in Newchurch-in-Pendle, an eye is carved on the tower, said to be the all-seeing eye of God. Local tradition says that it was originally placed there to protect the worshippers from the witches who once plagued the district.&lt;ref name="Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain"/&gt; In [[Almería]], Spain, is a carved limestone pillar with eyes or the oculos / oculi motif.

The Celts are well known for their cult of the "severed head" of which many examples exist as three-dimensional carvings or sculptures. Petrosomatoglyphs are much rarer. Pump Sant Stone near Carmarthen in Wales has the imprint in it of the heads of the five saints, named Ceitho, Celynnin, Gwyn, Gwyno and Gwynoro. The stone is made of [[Diorite]], a very hard stone brought from another district. It stands on a mound facing the Ogofau Lodge of [[Dolaucothi]] House, near to the Roman [[Gold]] Mines. It has depressions on all four faces characteristic of the wear produced from crushing quartz.&lt;ref name="An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire"&gt;''An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire''.

Two carved stone heads are located at Chapelhall House, [[Innellan]], Argyll.

It has been stated that many of the signs or symbols which accompany maze or geometric patterns from sites such as [[Newgrange]] in Ireland are identifiable or interpretable as human, the womb (lens symbol), the pubic area (lozenge symbol), fallopian horns (ram's horns), the female form (hour-glass symbol), breasts (''w'' or omega symbol), etc. The [[vesica piscis]] shape as found on the lid of the [[Chalice Well]] at [[Glastonbury]] includes an almond- or lozenge-shaped central area that is seen as a possible representation of the female genitals. Meehan&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;Meehan, Aidan (1996). ''Celtic design. Maze Patterns''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-27747-8}} Pps. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; does not, however, clearly indicate his sources for these interpretations.

[[Barclodiad y Gawres]] is a passage-grave on [[Anglesey]] with its internal surfaces decorated with lozenges, chevrons, wavy lines and spirals. The whole tomb has been likened to a womb, that of the [[Mother Goddess]]. These symbols are also commonly used in passage graves found in Ireland and [[Brittany]]. Triangular stones are sometimes regarded as being representations of the female sexual organs or overall body shape.&lt;ref name="Sharp1994"/&gt; At Boscawen un stone circle in Cornwall, a leaning central standing stone and a large white [[quartz]] boulder may represent the male and female elements of nature.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; At [[Carn Euny]] Iron Age village in Cornwall is a [[fogou]] which may represent the womb of the Great Earth Mother.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt;

At Avebury and West Kennet Avenue in [[Wiltshire]], the tall pillar and "broad diamond shape" stones were used alternately in the stone circles, possibly symbolising males and females at this famous [[Paganism|pagan]] ritual site.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; [[Stoney Littleton Long Barrow]] near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] has been likened to a "womb-tomb" of the Great Goddess who awaited the return of the sun.

Tolmen stones, such as the example on the North Teign river on [[Dartmoor]], England, are said to derive their name from the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''tol'' ("hole") and ''maen'' ("stone") and were thought to have been used by [[Druid]]s for purification and that the wrongdoer was lowered through into the water for lustration, a purification rite or cleansing ritual.&lt;ref name="tolmen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/tolmen.htm |title=Druids and bullauns |publisher=Legendarydartmoor.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rock-cut basin|hole]] in the stone represented the female birth canal in the Druid or pagan mind, and by passing through it, a person was symbolising the act of rebirth and therefore regaining innocence or being cleansed of post-[[Childbirth|parturition]] illness, etc.&lt;ref name="rebirth"&gt;Tuck, C. (2003).''Landscapes and Desire''. Pub. Sutton. Stroud.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male reproductive structures===

[[File:Chesterspetro.jpg|thumb|Phallic Petrosomatoglyph, [[Cilurnum]] Roman Fort, [[Chesters (Humshaugh)]], [[Scotland]]]]

[[Shivalinga]] is carved in [[List of Shiva temples in India|numerous Hindu temples]] across [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|southeast asia]], including in [[Angkor Wat]], [[List of rock-cut temples in India|rock-cut temples in India]] such as [[Aihole]], [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Amarnath Temple]], [[Badami cave temples]], [[Ellora Caves]], [[Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple]], [[Hampi]], [[Hulimavu Shiva cave temple]], [[Mahabalipuram]], [[Masroor Rock Cut Temple]], [[Udaygiri Caves]], [[Vaishno Devi]], etc.

Many references have been made to the obviously [[phallic]] appearance of standing stones. It is suggested that they may serve as stylised representations of the phallus, the purpose of which is to magically enhance the fertility of humans, animals and crops.&lt;ref name="Sharp1994"/&gt; A number of practices which are supposed to give fertility to barren women are linked to standing stones throughout Europe. At Avebury and West Kennet Avenue in [[Wiltshire]], the tall pillar and broad diamond shape stones were used alternately in the stone circles, possibly symbolising males and females at these famous [[Paganism|pagan]] ritual sites. At [[Boscawen un]] stone circle in Cornwall, a leaning central standing stone and a large white [[quartz]] boulder may represent the male and female elements of nature.&lt;ref name="Bord1988"/&gt; The [[Maypole]] is often considered a phallic symbol, coinciding with the worship of Germanic phallic figures such as that of [[Freyr]].

Phallic fertility symbols were carved for good luck, and they were also a powerful antagonist to the evil eye. The Romans regularly carved them onto military buildings, and [[Hadrian's Wall]] has several at [[Chesters]] and [[Housesteads]] forts. One at Barcombe Hill shows a crude phallus and testicles with the legs of a chicken.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;Graham, Frank (1990), ''Hadrian's Wall in the Days of the Romans.'' Pub. Frank Graham. {{ISBN|0-85983-177-9}}. P.230.&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, phalli are represented together with cup-marks, zig-zags, straggly-lines, etc., on the ninety or so stones of the 4000-year-old ''Cromeleque dos Almendres'' near [[Évora]].&lt;ref name="Cope"&gt;Cope, Julian (2004) ''The Negalithic European''. Pub. Element. London. {{ISBN|0-00-713802-4}}. P. 412–413.&lt;/ref&gt; At Valhaugen in Norway a realistic representation of a phallus has been found and restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=a312&amp;file=index&amp;do=showpic&amp;pid=49383 |title=Valhaugen |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple body parts===
At Portpatrick on the Island of [[St. Kilda, Scotland|St. Kilda]], there is the impression of a pair of knees and a right hand, said to be those of [[St. Patrick]] in the posture of prayer. In Cornwall, St. Newlyna knelt on a stone and left the impression of her elbows and knees in the posture of prayer. At Llanllyfni are found stones with the knee-prints, thumb and bed of St. Gredfyw. Medicine Rock in the USA was located on a hill fifteen miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Gettysburg, South Dakota|Gettysburg]], near the mouth of the Cheyenne Creek. Indians considered it to be a sacred rock and visited it regularly. Five footprints, hand prints and animal prints were originally visible, made by the [[Great Spirit]] of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].

==Recent and modern petrosomatoglyphs==
[[File:Georgemarsh Footprint2.jpg|left|thumb|This footprint is said to be made by Protestant martyr [[George Marsh (martyr)|George Marsh]].]]

Located at [[Smithills Hall]], near [[Bolton]] in [[Lancashire]], is the impressed footprint at the bottom of a set of stairs of [[George Marsh (martyr)|George Marsh]], a [[Protestant]] martyr. In 1555, Marsh was interrogated at Smithills Hall and then taken to [[Boughton, Cheshire|Boughton in Cheshire]] and burnt at the stake for the sake of his faith. It is said that the footprint is a [[divinity|divine]] reminder of this unjust persecution and murder.&lt;ref name="Folklore, Myths &amp; Legends of Britain"/&gt;

[[File:Handprints.jpg|thumb|Handprints made in wet [[concrete]]]]
Often, impressions of hands are made in concrete to commemorate the famous as at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]] (USA) on pavement slabs or in wet concrete. Making footprints in stone of family members is part of [[New Age]] beliefs.

In [[Sarajevo]], there is a preserved square of footpath or pavement asphalt with two shoe prints which are believed to be those of [[Gavrilo Princip]], made as he waited for the arrival of the motorcade of the Austrian [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]] in June 1914.  The Archduke's assassination precipitated the start of [[World War I|the Great War]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9298">In [[physics]], the '''reduced mass''' is the "effective" [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]] appearing in the [[two-body problem]] of [[Newtonian mechanics]].  It is a quantity which allows the two-body problem to be solved as if it were a [[one-body problem]]. Note, however, that the mass determining the [[gravitational force]] is ''not'' reduced. In the computation one mass ''can'' be replaced with the reduced mass, if this is compensated by replacing the other mass with the sum of both masses. The reduced mass is frequently denoted by &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; ([[Mu (letter)|mu]]), although the [[standard gravitational parameter]] is also denoted by &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; (as are [[Mu (letter)#Physics and engineering|a number of other physical quantities]]). It has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of mass, and [[SI unit]] kg.


==Equation==

Given two bodies, one with mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the other with mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the equivalent one-body problem, with the position of one body with respect to the other as the unknown, is that of a single body of mass&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, A.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \cfrac{1}{\cfrac{1}{m_1}+\cfrac{1}{m_2}} = \cfrac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2},\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the force on this mass is given by the force between the two bodies.

===Properties===

The reduced mass is always less than or equal to the mass of each body:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \leq m_1, \quad \mu \leq m_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

and has the reciprocal additive property:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{m_1} + \frac{1}{m_2} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which by re-arrangement is equivalent to half of the [[harmonic mean]].

In the special case that &lt;math&gt;m_1 = m_2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mu} = \frac{m_1}{2} = \frac{m_2}{2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;m_1 \gg m_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mu \approx m_2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Derivation==

The equation can be derived as follows.

===Newtonian mechanics===

{{main|Newtonian mechanics}}

Using [[Newton's second law]], the force exerted by body 2 on body 1 is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{12} = m_1 \mathbf{a}_1. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

The force exerted by body 1 on body 2 is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{21} = m_2 \mathbf{a}_2. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

According to [[Newton's third law]], the force that body 2 exerts on body 1 is equal and opposite to the force that body 1 exerts on body 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{12} = - \mathbf{F}_{21}.\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;m_1 \mathbf{a}_1 = - m_2 \mathbf{a}_2. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_2=-{m_1 \over m_2} \mathbf{a}_1. \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

The relative acceleration '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt; between the two bodies is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{\rm rel}= \mathbf{a}_1-\mathbf{a}_2 = \left(1+\frac{m_1}{m_2}\right) \mathbf{a}_1 = \frac{m_2+m_1}{m_1 m_2} m_1 \mathbf{a}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{F}_{12}}{\mu}. &lt;/math&gt;

So we conclude that body 1 moves with respect to the position of body 2 as a body of mass equal to the reduced mass.

===Lagrangian mechanics===

{{main|Lagrangian mechanics}}

Alternatively, a Lagrangian description of the two-body problem gives a [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] of

:&lt;math&gt;L = {1 \over 2} m_1 \mathbf{\dot{r}}_1^2 + {1 \over 2} m_2 \mathbf{\dot{r}}_2^2 - V(| \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2 | ) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{r}}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of mass &lt;math&gt;m_{i}&lt;/math&gt; (of particle ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;''). The potential energy ''V'' is a function as it is only dependent on the absolute distance between the particles. If we define 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2 &lt;/math&gt;
and let the centre of mass coincide with our origin in this reference frame, i.e. 
:&lt;math&gt; m_1 \mathbf{r}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{r}_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;,
then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}_1 = \frac{m_2 \mathbf{r}}{m_1 + m_2} , \; \mathbf{r}_2 = -\frac{m_1 \mathbf{r}}{m_1 + m_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then substituting above gives a new Lagrangian

:&lt;math&gt; L = {1 \over 2}\mu \mathbf{\dot{r}}^2 - V(r), &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} &lt;/math&gt;

is the reduced mass. Thus we have reduced the two-body problem to that of one body.

==Applications==

Reduced mass can be used in a multitude of two-body problems, where classical mechanics is applicable.

===Moment of inertia of two point masses in a line===

In a system with two point masses m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that they are co-linear, the [[center of mass]] may be found via 

&lt;math&gt;x_{cm} = \frac{m_1x_1 + m_2x_2}{m_1+m_2}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The [[moment of inertia]] of this system in the center of mass frame of reference is a two-body problem with two masses, each with its own distance to the center of mass. By converting to the equivalent reduced mass [[frame of reference]], the system may be treated as a single reduced mass, μ, with a distance, d, equal to the sum of x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because the rotational axis of the reduced mass frame of reference is through the combined mass, M (the sum of m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 

[[File:MOIaboutCOMaxis3.svg]][[File:MOIaboutCOMaxis4.svg]]

&lt;math&gt;M=m_1+m_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;d=x_1+x_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2} = \frac{m_1 m_2}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

The combined mass M is eliminated in the determination of the moment of inertia of the system since it is a point particle (making M the same size as μ, but with greater mass. Images not drawn to scale) along the axis of rotation (via the [[parallel axis theorem]], it's contribution of MR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; would be zero since R=0 because M and μ are ''also'' point masses).  Determining the moment of inertia of the reduced mass (μ) system is equivalent to determining the moment of inertia of the center of mass system. 

&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle I={\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{m_{1}\!+\!m_{2}}}d^{2}=\mu d^{2}}  &lt;/math&gt;

===Collisions of particles===

In a collision with a [[coefficient of restitution]] ''e'', the change in kinetic energy can be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}\mu v^2_{\rm rel}(e^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;,

where v&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt; is the relative velocity of the bodies before [[collision]].

For typical applications in nuclear physics, where one particle's mass is much larger than the other the reduced mass can be approximated as the smaller mass of the system. The limit of the reduced mass formula as one mass goes to infinity is the smaller mass, thus this approximation is used to ease calculations, especially when the larger particle's exact mass is not known.

===Motion of two massive bodies under their gravitational attraction===

In the case of the gravitational potential energy 
:&lt;math&gt;V(| \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2 | ) = - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{| \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2 |} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
we find that the position of the first body with respect to the second is governed by the same differential equation as the position of a body with the reduced mass orbiting a body with a mass equal to the sum of the two masses, because

:&lt;math&gt;m_1 m_2 = (m_1+m_2) \mu\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Non-relativistic quantum mechanics===

Consider the [[electron]] (mass ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'') and [[proton]] (mass ''m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'') in the [[hydrogen atom]].&lt;ref&gt;Molecular Quantum Mechanics Parts I and II: An Introduction to Quantum Chemistry (Volume 1), P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1977, {{ISBN|0-19-855129-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They orbit each other about a common centre of mass, a two body problem. To analyze the motion of the electron, a one-body problem, the reduced mass replaces the electron mass

:&lt;math&gt;m_e \rightarrow \frac{m_em_p}{m_e+m_p} &lt;/math&gt;

and the proton mass becomes the sum of the two masses

:&lt;math&gt;m_p \rightarrow m_e + m_p &lt;/math&gt;

This idea is used to set up the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the hydrogen atom.

===Other uses===

"Reduced mass" may also refer more generally to an [[algebra]]ic term of the form {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

:&lt;math&gt;x^* =  {1 \over {1 \over x_1} + {1 \over x_2}} = {x_1 x_2 \over x_1 + x_2}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

that simplifies an equation of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\ {1\over x^*} = \sum_{i=1}^n {1\over x_i} = {1\over x_1} + {1\over x_2} + \cdots+ {1\over x_n}.\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

The reduced mass is typically used as a relationship between two system elements in parallel, such as [[resistors]]; whether these be in the electrical, thermal, hydraulic, or mechanical domains.  A similar expression appears in the transversal vibrations of beams for the elastic moduli.&lt;ref&gt;Experimental study of the Timoshenko beam theory predictions, A.Díaz-de-Anda J.Flores, L.Gutiérrez, R.A.Méndez-Sánchez, G.Monsivais, and A.Morales.Journal of Sound and Vibration
Volume 331, Issue 26, 17 December 2012, Pages 5732-5744  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2012.07.041&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is determined by the physical properties of the elements as well as the [[continuity equation]] linking them.

== Early life ==
Robert Hanson was born in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/robert-hanson-1-1099926|title=Robert Hanson|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; state on May 25, 1920.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He and his two brothers were placed in an [[orphanage]] following the death of his mother when he was young. His father was a road builder and regularly absent. An uncle took them out of the orphanage and raised them at [[Garfield, Washington|Garfield]], Washington. While there, Robert was a star at athletics at high school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His sporting prowess saw him win a [[baseball]] [[scholarship]] to university.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Robert opted to go straight into work and became a [[construction worker]] in [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/10/local/me-hanson10|title=Robert Hanson, 85; Last Living Crewman of the Memphis Belle|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=2005-10-10|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there Robert enlisted in the [[United States Army|US Army]] in the summer of 1941.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he determined not to become an [[infantry]]man after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour]] and volunteered for radio training which saw his transfer to the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When training at Walla Walla, he was assigned to the ''Memphis Belle''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== ''Memphis Belle'' ==
[[File:Memphis Belle crew.jpg|thumb|310x310px|The "Memphis Belle" crew shown at an air base in England after completing 25 missions over enemy territory on June 7, 1943. Left to right: Tech. Sgt. Harold P. Loch, top turret gunner; Staff Sgt. Cecil H. Scott, ball turret gunner; '''Tech. Sgt. Robert J, Hanson''', radio operator; Capt. James A. Verinis, co-pilot; Capt. Robert K. Morgan, pilot; Capt. Charles B. Leighton, navigator; Staff Sgt. John P. Quinlan, tail gunner; Staff Sgt. Casimer A. Nastal, waist gunner; Capt. Vincent B. Evans, bombardier and Staff Sgt. Clarence E. Wichell, waist gunner.]]
The crew flew the ''Memphis Belle'' to their wartime base in the [[United Kingdom]] in September 1942. From there they flew against targets in [[France]] and [[Nazi Germany]] between November 7, 1942, and May 17, 1943. The air raids amounted to 148 hours of flying and over 60 tonnes of bombs dropped.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first raid on November 7 was against the dockyard at [[Brest, France|Brest]] in France. The crew's other missions came approximately every 10 days attacking the ports of France, [[Belgium]] and Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hanson carried a [[Rabbit's foot|lucky rabbit's foot]] on their missions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The crew had some close shaves: on one occasion the tail of the aircraft was shot away. This happened on January 23, 1943, while attacking the [[submarine pen]]s at [[Lorient]] in France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As Hanson related -&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
{{Quote|text="When we got the tail shot off, Capt. Morgan put the ship into a terrific dive and we dropped two- or three-thousand feet. It pretty nearly threw me out of the airplane,

"I hit the roof. I thought we were going down and wondered if I should bail out. Then he pulled up again and I landed on my back. I had an ammunition box and a frequency meter on top of me. I didn't know what was going on."|sign=Robert Hanson|source=LA Times (3)}}
The ''Memphis Belle'' made it back to base with 68 rips in the fabric of the [[fuselage]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On another occasion Hanson sneezed while writing in his [[logbook]]. At that moment a bullet passed through the space previously occupied by his head, striking his logbook. He kept the book for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The first aircraft to complete at tour of 25 missions was the [[Hot Stuff (aircraft)|Hot Stuff]], a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] bomber. However, it crashed into a mountain en route to the United States in bad weather. The ''Memphis Belle'' was selected to return to the United States in its place upon completing their 25-mission tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanairmuseum.com/aircraft/149|title=41-23728 {{!}} American Air Museum in Britain|website=www.americanairmuseum.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing their tour the crew were introduced to [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]. They then returned to the United States to take part in a 32-city tour to raise morale and sell war bonds. They were accompanied on the tour by their [[Terrier|Highland Terrier]] mascot called Stuka.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Their arrival back in the United States took place at Long Beach on August 19, 1943, to the cheers of thousands [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Later life ==
For the remainder of his life, Hanson used his wartime [[Morse code|Morse Code]] sign-off of "dit, dit, dit, dah, dit, dah" to end telephone calls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After his wartime service Hanson returned to Washington state. He worked for Nalley Fine Foods in Walla Walla as a salesman and subsequently a regional manager. He also worked for a Spokane candy company. Upon retirement he moved to [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Arizona]], and later [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1942 Hanson married Irene Payton, who survived him along with their son and daughter. However, he was predeceased by another daughter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Hanson appears in the 1944 documentary '[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress|The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]' directed by [[William Wyler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wyler|first=William|title=The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress|date=1944-04-13|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036152/|others=Stanley Wray, Robert Morgan, James A. Verinis|accessdate=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a 1990 film '[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]' directed by [[Michael Caton-Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Caton-Jones|first=Michael|title=Memphis Belle|date=1990-10-12|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100133/|others=Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz, Tate Donovan|accessdate=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1989 production Hanson visited the cast during filming at [[RAF Binbrook]] in the United Kingdom. Hanson joked, "They're not quite as good-looking as we were&amp;nbsp;... but they are young and enthusiastic – exactly like we were".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After the release of the film Hanson spoke to his grandson's high school class. When asked if what happened in the film was true, he replied "No, it didn't all happen to the ''Memphis Belle'', but everything in the movie happened to some B-17".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Rouge Bouquet''' is a part of the [[Parroy|Forêt de Parroy]] near the [[France|French]] village of [[Baccarat, Meurthe-et-Moselle|Baccarat]] that was the site of a German artillery bombardment of American trench positions on 7 March 1918 at 15:20 on the [[Chausailles sector]] of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration - Washington, DC.

The 22 men, including their platoon commander 1st Lieutenant John Norman, were assembled in a dugout when a German artillery shell landed on the roof of the dugout. A rescue effort by Major [[Wild Bill Donovan|William J.

The '''Sonoran Desert''' is a [[North American deserts|North American desert]] which covers large parts of the [[Southwestern United States]] in [[Arizona]] and [[California]] and of Northwestern Mexico in [[Sonora]], [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]], and [[Baja California Sur]]. It is the hottest desert in Mexico. It has an area of {{convert|260000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. The western portion of the [[United States–Mexico border]] passes through the Sonoran Desert.

In [[phytogeography]], the Sonoran Desert is within the Sonoran [[Floristic province|Floristic Province]] of the [[Madrean Region]] in southwestern North America, part of the [[Holarctic|Holarctic Kingdom]] of the northern [[Western Hemisphere]].  The desert contains a variety of unique and [[endemism|endemic]] [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, such as the [[saguaro]] (''Carnegiea gigantea'') and [[Stenocereus thurberi|organ pipe cactus]] (''Stenocereus thurberi'').

==Location==
The Sonoran desert wraps around the northern end of the [[Gulf of California]], from [[Baja California Sur]] ([[El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve]] in central and Pacific west coast, Central Gulf Coast subregion on east to southern tip), north through much of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]], excluding the central northwest mountains and Pacific west coast, through southeastern California and southwestern and southern Arizona to western and central parts of [[Sonora]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/|title=Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, Tucson, AZ - Zoo, Botanical Garden and Art Gallery|author=|date=|website=www.desertmuseum.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is bounded on the west by the [[Peninsular Ranges]], which separate it from the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] (northwest) and [[Baja California Desert]] (Vizcaino subregion, central and southeast) ecoregions of the Pacific slope. To the north in California and northwest Arizona, the Sonoran Desert transitions to the colder-winter, higher-elevation [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]], [[Great Basin]], and [[Colorado Plateau]] deserts.

To the east and southeast, the deserts transition to the [[Temperate coniferous forests|coniferous]] [[Arizona Mountains forests]] and [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] and [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests|Sierra Madre Occidental pine–oak forests]] at higher elevations. To the south the [[Sonoran-Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest|Sonoran–Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest]] is the transition zone from the Sonoran Desert to the tropical dry forests of the Mexican state of [[Sinaloa]].&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

==Sub-region deserts==
The desert's sub-regions include the [[Colorado Desert]] of southeastern California; and the [[Yuma Desert]] east of the north-to-south section of the [[Colorado River]] in southwest Arizona. In the 1957 publication, ''Vegetation of the Sonoran Desert'', Forrest Shreve divided the Sonoran Desert into seven regions according to characteristic vegetation: Lower Colorado Valley, Arizona Upland, Plains of Sonora, Foothills of Sonora, Central Gulf Coast, Vizcaíno Region, and Magdalena Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alic.arid.arizona.edu/sonoran/documents/mcginnies/McGinnies_overview.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030121161839/http://alic.arid.arizona.edu/sonoran/documents/mcginnies/McGinnies_overview.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 January 2003|title=Sonoran Desert: An Overview of the Sonoran Desert by William G. McGinnies|author=|date=21 January 2003|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ecologists now consider Shreve's Vizcaíno and Magdalena regions, which lie on the western side of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], to be a separate [[ecoregion]], the [[Baja California Desert]].

Within the southern Sonoran Desert in Mexico is found the [[Gran Desierto de Altar]], with the ''[[Pinacate Peaks|Reserva de la Biosfera el Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar]]'' ('Pinacate National Park' in Mexico), extending {{convert|2000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} of desert and mountainous regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bajaquest.com/penasco/pinacate.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Pinacate National Park includes the only active [[Erg (landform)|Erg]] dune region in North America. The nearest city to the ''Reserva de la Biosfera el Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar'' is [[Puerto Peñasco]] (a.k.a. 'Rocky Point') in the state of [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]].

;Sub-regions
Sonoran Desert sub-regions include:
*[[Colorado Desert]]
*[[Gran Desierto de Altar]]
*[[Lechuguilla Desert]]
*[[Tonopah Desert]]
*[[Yuha Desert]]

Many plants not only survive, but thrive in the harsh conditions of the Sonoran Desert. Many have evolved to have specialized adaptations to the desert climate. The Sonoran Desert's biseasonal rainfall pattern results in more plant species than any other desert in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Sonoran desert|id=na1310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sonoran Desert includes  plant genera and species from the [[agave]] family, [[Arecaceae|palm]] family, [[cactus]] family, [[legume]] family, and numerous others.

The Sonoran is the only place in the world where the famous [[saguaro cactus]]  (''Carnegiea gigantea'') grows in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/sagu/planyourvisit/upload/Saguaro-Brochure.pdf|title=The Saguaro Cactus|author=|date=|website=nps.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cylindropuntia|Cholla]] (''Cylindropuntia'' spp.), [[Opuntia basilaris|beavertail]] (''Opuntia basilaris''), [[Echinocereus|hedgehog]] (''Echinocereus'' spp.), [[Ferocactus wislizeni|fishhook]] (''Ferocactus wislizeni''), [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] (''Opuntia'' spp.), [[Peniocereus|nightblooming cereus]] (''Peniocereus'' spp.), and [[Stenocereus thurberi|organ pipe]] (''Stenocereus thurberi'') are other taxa of cacti found here. Cactus provides food and homes to many desert mammals and birds, with showy flowers in reds, pinks, yellows, and whites, blooming most commonly from late March through June, depending on the species and seasonal temperatures.

[[Larrea tridentata|Creosote bush]] (''Larrea tridentata'') and [[Ambrosia dumosa|bur sage]] (''Ambrosia dumosa'') dominate valley floors. [[Psorothamnus fremontii|Indigo bush]] (''Psorothamnus fremontii'') and [[Mormon tea]] are other shrubs that may be found. [[List of Sonoran Desert wildflowers|Wildflowers of the Sonoran Desert]] include [[Abronia villosa|desert sand verbena]] (''Abronia villosa''), [[Geraea canescens|desert sunflower]] (''Geraea canescens''), and [[evening primrose]]s.

[[File:Gateway to the Springs.jpg|thumb|left|The entrance to [[Palm Springs, California]] via [[Highway 62]]]]

During the winter months, from November to April, the daytime temperatures in the Coachella Valley range from 70&amp;nbsp;°F (21&amp;nbsp;°C) to 90&amp;nbsp;°F (32&amp;nbsp;°C) and corresponding nighttime lows range from 46&amp;nbsp;°F (8&amp;nbsp;°C) to 68&amp;nbsp;°F (20&amp;nbsp;°C) making it a popular winter resort destination. Due to its warm year-round climate [[citrus]] and subtropical fruits such as mangoes, figs, and dates are grown in the Coachella Valley and adjacent [[Imperial Valley]]. Imperial Valley has a total population of about 188,000 and has a similar climate to that of the Coachella Valley.

The '''South Pacific Convergence Zone''' (SPCZ), a reverse-oriented [[monsoon trough]], is a band of low-level convergence, cloudiness and precipitation extending from the [[Western Pacific Warm Pool]] at the maritime continent south-eastwards towards French Polynesia and as far as the [[Cook Islands]] (160W, 20S). The SPCZ is a portion of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) which lies in a band extending east-west near the Equator but can be more extratropical in nature, especially east of the [[International Date Line]].  It is considered the largest and most important piece of the ITCZ, and has the least dependence upon heating from a nearby landmass during the summer than any other portion of the [[monsoon trough]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Linacre and B. Geerts. [http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap12/spcz.html Movement of the South Pacific Convergence Zone.] Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPCZ can affect the precipitation on Polynesian islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean, so it is important to understand how the SPCZ behaves with large-scale, global climate phenomenon, such as the ITCZ, [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]], and the [[Interdecadal Pacific oscillation]] (IPO), a portion of the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]].

==Position==
[[File:Folland2002 figure1.png|thumbnail|right|Figure 1 of Folland et al. (2002) shows the mean position of the SPCZ based on four different measurements: maximum rainfall, maximum of low level [[Cloud|convergence]], maxima of the 500 hPa vertical motion, and the minimum in [[outgoing longwave radiation]] (OLR)]]

The SPCZ occurs where the southeast trades from transitory [[anticyclone]]s to the south meet with the semipermanent easterly flow from the eastern South Pacific anticyclone. The SPCZ exists in summer and winter but can change its orientation and location. It is often distinct from the ITCZ over Australia, but at times they become one continuous zone of convergence. The location of the SPCZ is affected by [[El Niño|ENSO]] and [[Interdecadal Pacific oscillation]] conditions.  It generally stretches from the [[Solomon Islands]] through [[Vanuatu]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]], and [[Tonga]].  Low-level convergence along this band forms cloudiness as well as showers and [[thunderstorm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=south-pacific-convergence-zone1 South Pacific convergence zone.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210848/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=south-pacific-convergence-zone1 |date=2007-09-30 }} Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thunderstorm activity, or convection, within the band is dependent upon the season, as the more equatorward portion is most active in the Southern Hemisphere summer, and the more poleward portion is most active during transition seasons of [[fall]] and spring.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen B. Cocks.

===Measuring SPCZ position===
The climatological position can be estimated by computing its mean position over 30 or more years.&lt;ref name="Folland"&gt;{{cite journal | author=C. K. Folland, J. A. Renwick, [[Jim Salinger|M. J. Salinger]], A. B. Mullan | title=Relative influences of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and ENSO in the South Pacific Convergence Zone | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | volume=29 | issue=13 | year=2002 | pages=21–1–21–4|doi=10.1029/2001GL014201 | bibcode=2002GeoRL..29.1643F}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several metrics to measure the position of the SPCZ. The location of maximum rainfall, maximum of low level [[Cloud|convergence]], maxima of the 500 hPa vertical motion, and the minimum in [[outgoing longwave radiation]] (OLR) are four indicators of the SPCZ axis.&lt;ref name="Folland" /&gt; Figure 1 shows qualitative agreement between all of these SPCZ indicators.

==Changes in SPCZ position==
The position of the SPCZ can change on seasonal, interannual, and possibly longer timescales.

===Observations===
Research into SPCZ movements of the 20th century are linked to changes in the IPO and ENSO.&lt;ref name=Folland /&gt; Folland et al., 2002 defined an index to describe the [[Interdecadal Pacific oscillation]] (IPO) with sea surface temperature and night marine air temperature to determine how the SPCZ varies with the IPO. When the IPO index has negative temperature anomalies, the SPCZ is displaced southwest and moves northeastward when the IPO index has positive temperature anomalies. The [[Southern Oscillation Index]] (SOI) is a metric for describing warm- and cold-phase conditions associated with the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) and can also describe movements of the position of the SPCZ. Negative SOI index values are associated with warm-phase or El Niño-like conditions and a northeastward displacement of the SPCZ. Positive SOI index values, on the other hand, describe cold-phase or La Niña-like conditions and a southwestward displacement of the SPCZ.&lt;ref name="Folland" /&gt;

Determining the position of the SPCZ over longer timescales in the past (pre-20th century) has been studied using coral records of the southwest Pacific.&lt;ref name="Linsley"&gt;Braddock K. Linsley, Alexey Kaplan, Yves Gouriou, [[Jim Salinger]], Peter B. deMenocal, Gerard M. Wellington, and Stephen S. Howe. [http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2005GC001115.shtml Tracking the extent of the South Pacific Convergence Zone since the early 1600s.] Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Linsley et al. (2006) reconstructed sea-surface temperature and sea surface salinity in the southwest Pacific starting circa 1600CE by measuring the oxygen isotopic composition of four [[Porites]] coral records from [[Rarotonga]] and two from [[Fiji]]. Coral isotope measurements provide information on both sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity, so they can indicate times of increased or decreased temperature and/or precipitation associated with changes in the position of the SPCZ. Their coral oxygen isotope index indicated an eastward shift of the decadal mean position of the SPCZ since the mid 1800s. A shift of the SPCZ in this direction suggests there were more La Niña-like or cold-phase conditions in the Pacific, during this period, often called the [[Little Ice Age]].&lt;ref name="Linsley" /&gt; Additional paleoclimate studies are still needed in order to test the reliability of these coral results.

The IPO and ENSO can interact together to produce changes in the position of the SPCZ. West of about 140 W, both ENSO (measured with [[Southern Oscillation Index]]) and IPO strongly influence the SPCZ latitude, but farther east only ENSO is a significant factor. Only near 170 W is there any indication of an interaction between the two factors.&lt;ref name="Folland" /&gt;

===Climate modelling===
Besides observations of the SPCZ and movement in its position, there have been modelling studies as well.&lt;ref name="Widlanksy"&gt;Matthew J. Widlansky, Axel Timmermann, Karl Stein, Shayne McGregor, Niklas Schneider, Matthew H. England, Matthieu Lengaigne, and Wenju Cai. [http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n4/full/nclimate1726.html   Changes in South Pacific rainfall bands in a warming climate]&lt;/ref&gt; Widlansky et al. (2012) used a number of [[climate models]] of differing complexity to simulate rainfall bands in the southwest Pacific and see how the magnitude and areal extent was affected by the SPCZ and [[ENSO]]. During El Niño or warm-phase conditions, the SPCZ typically shifted northeastward with dryer conditions on islands to the southwest, in agreement with observations. Conversely, a southwestward shift in rainfall accompanied La Niña or cold-phase events in the simulations. Widlanksy et al. (2012) argued the sea surface temperature biases in models created uncertainty in the rainfall projections and produce what has been named “the double ITCZ problem”. The impact of sea surface temperature bias was further investigated by using uncoupled atmospheric models with prescribed sea surface temperatures, and those 3 models each with differing complexity showed less severe double ITCZ bias than the ensemble of coupled models.&lt;ref name="Widlanksy" /&gt;

Warmer colors indicate increased precipitation or salinity while colder colors indicate decreased precipitation or salinity. The salinity front, a function of SPCZ position, is labeled in the bottom panel.]]

At its southeast edge, the circulation around the feature forces a salinity gradient in the ocean, with fresher and warmer waters of the western Pacific lying to its west.  Cooler and saltier waters lie to its east.&lt;ref name="Linsley" /&gt;

The '''Spanish Plume''' (Penacho Ibérico in Spanish and Spaanse Pluim in Dutch) is a weather pattern in which a [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] of warm air moves from the [[Iberia]]n plateau or the [[Sahara]] to [[northwest Europe]] giving rise to severe thunderstorms. This meteorological pattern can lead to [[Heat wave|extreme high temperatures]] and intense rainfall during the summer months, with potential for [[flash flood]]ing, damaging [[hail]] storms and [[tornado]] formation. Some of these intense thunderstorm are formed from [[Thermal low|thermal lows]]. Thermal lows is also known as [[Thermal low|heat lows]]. Thermal lows can be semi permanent feature around some parts of the Europe particularly in the summer season. These thermal lows can be developed or created around Spain, Portugal, France etc. during the summer season because of the intense heat. Thermal low pressure can be located around the world particularly in the summer or tropical regions.

"'''The Heathen'''" is a short story by the American writer [[Jack London]]. It was first published in ''[[Everybody's Magazine]]'' in August 1910,&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|id=612289|title=The Heathen}}, accessed 15 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and later included in the collection of stories by London, ''The Strength of the Strong'', published by [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]] in 1914.&lt;ref name=jlnet&gt;[http://www.jacklondons.net/writings/StrengthStrong/contents.html ''The Strength of the Strong''] The World of Jack London, accessed 15 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story, two people, from different cultural and racial backgrounds, are the only survivors of a ship that encounters a hurricane in the Pacific, and they remain together.

==Background==
In 1907 London began a voyage across the [[Pacific Ocean]] in his [[ketch]] the ''Snark'', and visited islands in the south Pacific, concluding the voyage in Sydney, Australia. He wrote about the adventure in his book ''[[The Cruise of the Snark]]''. "The Heathen" is set among islands that London visited during that period.

==Plot summary==
The narrator, a pearl buyer named Charley, is a cabin passenger on a [[schooner]], the ''Petite Jeanne'', sailing from [[Rangiroa]] to [[Tahiti]] with a [[Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)|Kanaka]] crew, at the end of the pearling season in the [[Paumotuan|Paumotas]]. The boat, having eighty-five deck passengers, is overloaded. Several passengers die of [[smallpox]]; Charley and the other cabin passengers drink whisky, until it runs out, in the belief that it will kill the smallpox germs.

The boat is in the direct path of a hurricane. "The second sea filled the ''Petite Jeanne'''s decks flush with the rails, and, as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward, all the miserable dunnage of life and luggage poured aft. It was a human torrent.... Out of all my experiences I could not have believed it possible for the wind to blow as it did.... It was a monstrous thing, and the most monstrous thing about it was that it increased and continued to increase."

The ''Petite Jeanne'' is destroyed in the hurricane, and Charley survives by clinging to a hatch cover from the boat, sharing it with a Kanaka named Otoo. Eventually Charley loses consciousness, and comes to on the beach of an [[atoll]]; Otoo has saved his life by pulling him from the water. They are the only survivors from the ''Petite Jeanne''.

They exchange names. "In the South Seas such a ceremony binds two men closer together than blood-brothership." They part in [[Papeete]] and Otoo goes home to [[Bora Bora]]; but he returns, because his wife has died. He accompanies Charley for the next seventeen years, ensuring that he does not come to harm.

"Truly, he made me a better man. Yet he was not strait-laced. And he knew nothing of common Christian morality.... he was a heathen... a gross materialist who believed that when he died he was dead. He believed merely in fair play and square-dealing.... Otoo had my welfare always at heart. He thought ahead for me, weighed my plans and took a greater interest in them than I did myself."

Otoo advises Charley to become a captain of a schooner, in order to save enough to own a plantation. He does so; he marries and has children. Otoo helps to bring up the children on the plantation.

The relationship ends when Otoo is killed saving Charley from sharks on the coast of [[Savu]]. "And so passed Otoo, who saved me and made me a man, and who saved me in the end." 

==Commentary==
In a 2006 collection of stories by London including "The Heathen", the editors comment: "In the early 1940s, when this story found its way into fiction anthologies and high school textbooks, it was admired for its fiercely detailed picture of a storm at sea and for its courageous examination of a friendship that transcended cultural and racial differences.... It is nowadays impossible for us to read the account of the friendship between Charley and Otoo so simply.... By the 1970s, as editors began to see the complexity of the ideas about race embedded in "The Heathen", it simply became easier to drop the story from collections altogether."

She first gained recognition for her active presence on [[Social networking service|social networking websites]]. After becoming the most popular person on [[Myspace]],&lt;ref name="SlateTila"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2139691/|title=Tila Tequila, the first star of MySpace|last=Weiner|first=Jonah|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=April 11, 2006|accessdate=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tequila was offered the opportunity to star in her own reality television series. Her bisexual-themed dating show, ''[[A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila]]'' (2007), aired for two seasons and became [[MTV]]'s second highest-rated series premiere of that year.

Born in [[Singapore]] and raised in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], Tequila moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 2001 to pursue her modeling career. After being featured in numerous men's magazines (including ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''), she made her reality television debut on the [[VH1]] show ''[[Surviving Nugent]]'' (2003). Besides her career in modeling and television, Tequila also pursued her career as a recording artist and author. She was the lead singer of the bands Beyond Betty Jean and Jealousy, before launching a solo career. Her debut single "[[I Love U (Tila Tequila song)|I Love U]]" was released in 2007 to mixed reviews. Despite having strong online sales, the song failed to enter any charts. Tequila followed with several independently released singles, including "[[Stripper Friends]]" and "Paralyze". In 2010, she released her second EP ''[[Welcome to the Dark Side]]''. Her book, ''Hooking Up With Tila Tequila: A Guide to Love, Fame, Happiness, Success, and Being the Life of the Party'' was published in 2008.

She has subsequently received negative attention for her support of [[Adolf Hitler]], as well as [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] comments,&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abraham-h-foxman/anti-semitism-the-week-in_b_4441621.html|title=Anti-Semitism: The Week in Review|last=Foxman|first=Abraham H.|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 13, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prestigiacomo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailywire.com/news/5519/former-mtv-star-tila-tequila-put-shapiro-gas-amanda-prestigiacomo|title=Former MTV Star Tila Tequila: Put Shapiro In A Gas Chamber, Ship Him To Israel|last=Prestigiacomo|first=Amanda|work=[[The Daily Wire]]|date=May 6, 2016|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to her expulsion from ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34093252/tila-tequila-thrown-out-of-celebrity-big-brother|title=Tila Tequila thrown out of Celebrity Big Brother - BBC Newsbeat|work=[[BBC News]]|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Nguyen was born in [[Singapore]], where her family were [[Vietnamese boat people]], who arrived from [[Vietnam]] after the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tila-tequila-mn0000280204/biography|title=Artist Biography [Tila Tequila]|last=Brown|first=Marisa|publisher=[[AllMusic.com]]|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bozell"/&gt; Nguyen has an older brother, Daniel, and older sister, Terri.&lt;ref name="hooking up"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hooking Up With Tila Tequila|last1=Tequila|first1=Tila|first2=Sarah|last2=Tomlinson|publisher=Scribner|edition=illustrated|year=2008|isbn=9781439101537}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} When she was one year old, the family relocated to a neighborhood in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] and were eventually admitted to a [[gated community]] run by a strict [[Buddhist]] temple.&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/tila_tequila/season_2/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=9876|title=Full Biography|work=A Shot At Love 2 With Tila Tequila|publisher=MTV|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family left the community when Nguyen was eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollowverse.com/tila-tequila/|title=The religion and political views of Tila Tequila|last=Kershaw|first=Tom|work=Hollowverse.com|date=February 24, 2013|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nguyen was nicknamed "Tila Tequila" by friends due to her [[Alcohol flush reaction|apparent allergy to alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/tila-tequila/biography/|title=About Tila Tequila|work=MTV|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/tila-tequila "Tila Tequila: Biography"]. ''Rhapsody''.&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoir, she would later explain that she felt "confused" and "lost" from various personal family and environmental issues. She turned to writing poems in an attempt to release powerful emotions, and friends outside the gang briefly helped turn her life around. At age 16, Nguyen ran away to [[Queens]], [[New York City]], for several months.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; While still 16, she experienced a [[drive-by shooting]] in Houston. She reports having become pregnant and suffering a [[miscarriage]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=41736&amp;blogId=516050834|title=The Truth Comes Out!

Nguyen graduated from [[Alief Hastings High School]] in 2000. She has cited her violent adolescence in Texas as her reason for becoming a model and moving to California in 2001.&lt;ref name="hooking up"/&gt; In a March 2003 interview, she revealed that she has taken some college classes but does not have a degree, stating, "I didn't want to go to college for an actual degree because there's nothing out there I like besides doing something that involves the [[entertainment industry]]."&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"/&gt;

==Career==

===2001–2005: Modeling career, Beyond Betty Jean and Myspace===
[[File:Tila Nguyen import model.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tequila at a car show in December 2005]]
Nguyen's career began at the age of 19 when she was discovered at the [[Sharpstown Mall]] by a ''[[Playboy]]'' scout and was offered a chance to model nude for the magazine. She did a test shoot, then eventually moved to Southern California and was featured as ''Playboy''{{'}}s Cyber Girl of the week on April 22, 2002,&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cars.ign.com/articles/389/389506p1.html|title=SRS Babe of the Week: Tila Nguyen|last=Rodriguez|first=Tyrone|work=[[IGN]]|date=March 13, 2003|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon thereafter she became the first Asian Cyber Girl of the Month.&lt;ref name="TilasHotSpotQuickBio"&gt;{{cite web|work=The Official Tila Nguyen Website|publisher=The Wayback Machine|url=http://www.tilashotspot.com/popups/short_biography.html|title=Quick Bio|last=Nguyen|first=Tila|year=2006|accessdate=July 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507192933/http://www.tilashotspot.com/popups/short_biography.html|archivedate=May 7, 2006}} (Retrieved through the Wayback Machine)&lt;/ref&gt; A few more pictorials for the magazine followed.&lt;ref name="Bozell"/&gt;

At age 20, Nguyen acted on her interest in rock music and started looking for bands willing to let her join. She eventually assembled a band called Beyond Betty Jean, for which she was singer and songwriter. Beyond Betty Jean eventually broke up and Nguyen started working in recording studios to sharpen her vocal skills and wrote music.&lt;ref name="TilasHotSpotQuickBio"/&gt; Later, she became the lead singer of a band called Jealousy, which released a few songs online before breaking up. In 2003, Nguyen was a contestant on [[VH1]]'s ''Surviving Nugent'', a [[Reality television|reality TV]] show where participants performed compromising tasks and stunts for rock star [[Ted Nugent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vh1.com/sitewide/templates/img/lower_bg.gif|title=Surviving Nugent: Interviews: Tila – Contestant|publisher=[[VH1]]|accessdate=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nguyen gained further popularity through the [[Import scene|import racing scene]]. She has been featured on the cover of ''Import Tuner'' magazine, at car shows such as Hot Import Nights, and in the video game ''[[Street Racing Syndicate]]''.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameProSRS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox/games/previews/36729.shtml|title=Hands-On: SRS: Street Racing Syndicate|author=FUNKYZEALOT|work=[[GamePro]]|date=July 13, 2004|accessdate=July 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603121618/http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox/games/previews/36729.shtml|archivedate=June 3, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen joined [[Myspace]] in the fall of 2003 after getting booted off of [[Friendster]] multiple times.&lt;ref name="TimeProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1570728,00.html|title=Tila Tequila|last=Grossman|first=Lev|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Time Magazine, in a 2006 profile of Nguyen noted her impact on the platform stating "Pre-Tila, your MySpace friends were mostly people you actually knew. Post-Tila, the biggest game on the site became Who Has the Most Friends, period, whoever they might be."&lt;ref name="TimeProfile"/&gt; also calling her, the "Queen" of the site.&lt;ref name="TimeProfile"/&gt;

===2006–2009: Solo career, and ''A Shot at Love''===

During the first season of [[Fuse TV|Fuse TV's]] dance show, ''[[Pants-Off Dance-Off]]'', on which a group of contestants [[Striptease|strip]] to [[music video]]s, Nguyen was the most frequent host.&lt;ref name="Bozell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaresearch.org/BozellColumns/entertainmentcolumn/2007/col20071130.asp |title=Tila Tequila, MTV's Latest Poison |last=Bozell |first=L.

Despite this major-label signing, Nguyen independently released her first single "[[I Love U (Tila Tequila song)|I Love U]]" through [[iTunes]] on February 27, 2007, justifying the independent release through her desire to become famous by herself.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; She also shot a music video for the song. In March 2007, Washington-based record label The Saturday Team released an EP called ''[[Sex (Tila Tequila EP)|Sex]]'', by Tila Tequila.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; On July 27, 2007, Italian website MusicBlob reported that The Saturday Team and distributor Icon Music Entertainment Services sued Nguyen over breaching her contract related to the album.&lt;ref name="MusicBlob"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicblob.it/what-happened-to-tila-tequila-a-musicblob-exclusive.html |title=What happened to Tila Tequila|publisher=MusicBlob |date=July 27, 2007 |accessdate=July 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902050215/http://www.musicblob.it/what-happened-to-tila-tequila-a-musicblob-exclusive.html |archivedate=September 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nguyen claimed in a MySpace bulletin&lt;ref name="MusicBlob"/&gt; that the EP was not authorized for release by her, and was removed from most retailers. The Saturday Team won a legal case, making ''Sex'' available for digital purchase.

In May 2007, Nguyen began filming for a [[reality show]] which first aired on MTV on October 9, 2007, as ''A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila''.

===2010–2014: ''Welcome to the Darkside'' and hiatus===
[[File:Matchstik And Tila Tequila On The Red Carpet.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Tequila and Matchstick at the 14th Grammy Friends 'N' Family Party, 2011]]
By 2010, Tequila decided to reinvent her image and changed her stage name to Miss Tila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/stop-the-presses-tila-tequila-reinvents-herself-as-41038|title=Stop the presses!

In May, she launched her celebrity gossip blog, MissTilaOMG.com, and the EP, ''[[Welcome to the Dark Side|Welcome to the Darkside]]'', which marked a musical departure from her previous material. Influenced by classical music and artists such as [[Nina Simone]] and [[Billie Holiday]], ''Welcome to the Darkside'' received more positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.com/article/1150|title=Miss Tila (Formerly Tila Tequila) Speaks Her Mind and Holds Nothing Back|last=Kugel|first=Allison|publisher=PR.com|date=April 19, 2010|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not manage to gain commercial success.

Tequila began a tour supporting the new EP and at one of her tour stops in August 2010, she appeared at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]], a music festival founded by hip hop duo [[Insane Clown Posse]]. She was repeatedly pelted with rocks and bottles among other objects, and she vowed to take legal action against the organizers and promoters for the event.&lt;ref name="CNNTila"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/08/15/tila.tequila.attacked/index.html?hpt=T2|title=Tila Tequila suffers cuts, but escapes juggalos attack|last=Duke|first=Alan|work=[[CNN]]|date=August 15, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MTVTila"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/08/16/tila-tequila-juggalo-attack/|title=Tila Tequila's Juggalo Disaster Joins The List Of Wildest Stage Attacks|last=Anderson|first=Kyle|work=[[MTV]]|date=August 16, 2010|accessdate=August 16, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818155208/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/08/16/tila-tequila-juggalo-attack|archivedate=August 18, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015–present: ''Celebrity Big Brother'' and return to music===

In August, Tequila became one of the contestants on the [[Celebrity Big Brother 16|sixteenth season]] of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] reality series ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. However, she was ejected from the house after just one day, due to many viewer complaints of her controversial statements made in 2013, when she posted [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] comments and praised German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stutz|first=Colin|date=August 28, 2015|title=Tila Tequila Kicked Off 'Celebrity Big Brother' for Nazi Sympathizing: Report|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6678594/tila-tequila-kicked-off-celebrity-big-brother-nazi-sympathizing|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tequila posted a snippet of "Drunk Dialing" again in September and confirmed it would be released by the end of October along with a music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/09/29/tila-tequila-drunk-dialing-preview-new-song-instagram-video/|title=Tila Tequila Drops Preview For Upcoming Single, 'Drunk Dialing'|last=Benozilio|first=Shira|work=Hollywood Life|publisher=PMC Network|date=September 29, 2015|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7609615/tila-tequila-drunk-dialing-preview-listen|title=Music Is Saved: Tila Tequila Previews "Drunk Dialing," First New Single In Four Years|last=Daw|first=Robbie|website=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=September 29, 2015|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Tequila and her management confirmed the single would be released on December 4.

==Political views==
In December 2013, Nguyen caused controversy by posting an article on her website titled "Why I Sympathize with Hitler: Part I", although she stated that her views on [[Hitler]] were not derived from [[antisemitism]] on her part, nor any feelings toward Jewish people.&lt;ref name=NewsMax&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/tila-tequila-hitler/2013/12/10/id/541113|title=Tila Tequila Says Hitler Just 'Trying His Best to Help His Country'|last=Chilson|first=Morgan|work=[[Newsmax]]|date=December 10, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also posted pro-Hitler and antisemitic comments on her [[Facebook]] page,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/155544/tila-tequila-jew-converts-to-sexy-hitler Tila Tequila, Jew(?), Converts to Sexy Hitler] Tablet Magazine.

These actions angered her Facebook followers, and resulted in Facebook closing her account and removing the material in question.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"/&gt; In August 2015, Tequila became a contestant in the [[Celebrity Big Brother 16|sixteenth series]] of British television reality show ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'', but was asked to leave the programme on its second day when producers became aware of her comments and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34093252/tila-tequila-thrown-out-of-celebrity-big-brother|title=Tila Tequila thrown out of Celebrity Big Brother - BBC Newsbeat|work=[[BBC]]|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently apologized for her earlier comments, blaming them on depression and drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=August 29, 2015|title=Tila Tequila apologizes for antisemitic comments after Big Brother exit|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/08/29/tila-tequila-apologizes-for-anti-semitic-comments-after-big-brother-exit|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2016, Nguyen tweeted that [[Jewish-American]] political commentator [[Ben Shapiro]] should "be gassed and sent back to Israel" and later posted that "There are only two things in this world, for which I would gladly sacrifice my own life; the destruction of all Jews and preservation of the [[white race]]" and "You know what will help Asians earn respect?

In [[meteorology]], an '''undular bore''' is a [[wave]] disturbance in the Earth's [[atmosphere]] and can be seen through unique cloud formations.  They normally occur within an area of the atmosphere which is stable in the low levels after an [[outflow boundary]] or a [[cold front]] moves through.

In [[hydraulics]], an undular bore is a gentle [[tidal bore|bore]] with an undular [[hydraulic jump]] pattern at the downstream ([[Supercritical flow|subcritical]]) side.

==In meteorology==
[[Image:Undular bore wave two.gif|300px|right|thumb|[[NEXRAD]] radar image of undular bore wave]]

===Overview===
Undular bores are usually formed when two air masses of different temperatures collide. When a low level boundary such as a cold front or outflow boundary approaches a layer of cold, stable air, it creates a disturbance in the atmosphere producing a wave-like motion, known as a [[gravity wave]].   Although the undular bore waves appear as bands of [[clouds]] across the sky, they are [[transverse waves]], and are propelled by the transfer of energy from an oncoming storm and are shaped by gravity. The ripple like appearance of this wave is described as the disturbance in the water when a pebble is dropped into a pond or when a moving boat creates waves in the surrounding water. The object displaces the water or [[Transmission medium|medium]] the wave is travelling through and the medium moves in an upward motion.  However, because of gravity, the water or medium is pulled back down and the repetition of this cycle creates the transverse wave motion.&lt;ref name="Mauritania"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arpal.org/Pubbl/paper/eumetsat-mauritania.pdf |title=Outflow from convective storm, Mauritania and adjacent Atlantic Ocean (13 August 2006) |author1=Martin Setvak |author2=Jochen Kerkmann |author3=Alexander Jacob |author4=HansPeter Roesli |author5=Stefano Gallino |author6=Daniel Lindsey |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=2009-07-03 |date=2007-03-19 |publisher=Agenzia Regionale per la Protezione dell'Ambiente Ligure |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725013807/http://www.arpal.org/Pubbl/paper/eumetsat-mauritania.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The undular bore's wavelength can measure {{convert|5|mi|km}} peak to peak and can travel {{convert|16|km/h|mph}} to {{convert|95|km/h|mph}}.&lt;ref name="Mauritania"/&gt;  The medium it travels through is the [[atmosphere]].  There are several varying types of ‘‘bores’’ in different layers of the atmosphere, such as the mesospheric bore which occurs in the [[mesosphere]].

===Occurrences===
Rare but not unknown in a great many locations, the waves appear with some predictability and regularity in the Gulf of Carpentaria during Spring. They have been seen as frequently as six days in a row according to reports by the two pilots who have most experience with 
soaring these sometimes enormous examples of the undular bore, known in Australia as the [[Morning Glory cloud]].

The term "bore" is also used to describe positive surges advancing in shallow waters. When the surge's [[Froude number]] is less than 1.4 to 1.7 (i.e. above unity and below a number somewhere in the range 1.4 to 1.7), the advancing front is followed by a train of well-defined free-surface undulations (called "''whelps''").&lt;ref name="Chanson 2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chanson, Hubert |title=Current Knowledge In Hydraulic Jumps And Related Phenomena. A Survey of Experimental Results  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162239 |publisher=European Journal of Mechanics B/Fluids, Vol. 28, No. 2, pp. 191–210 {{doi|10.1016/j.euromechflu.2008.06.004}}|year=2009 |issn=0997-7546|authorlink=Hubert Chanson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surge is then called an undular surge or undular bore.

The undulations form a [[standing wave]] pattern, relative to the undular bore front. So, the [[phase velocity]] (propagation velocity relative to still water) of the undulations is just high enough to keep the undulations stationary relative to the bore front.  Now, in [[water wave]]s, the [[group velocity]] (which is also the energy-transport velocity) is less than the [[phase velocity]]. Therefore, on average, wave energy of the undulations is transported away from the front, and contributing to the energy loss in the region of the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Vacuum packing''' is a method of [[packaging]] that removes air from the package prior to sealing. This method involves (manually or automatically) placing items in a plastic film package, removing air from inside,  and sealing the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shrink film]] is sometimes used to have a tight fit to the contents.
The intent of vacuum packing is usually to remove oxygen from the container to extend the [[shelf life]] of foods and, with flexible package forms, to reduce the volume of the contents and package.&lt;ref&gt;

Vacuum packing reduces atmospheric oxygen, limiting the growth of [[aerobic bacteria]] or [[fungus|fungi]], and preventing the [[evaporation]] of [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components. It is also commonly used to store dry foods over a long period of time, such as [[cereal]]s, [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s, cured [[meat]]s, [[cheese]], smoked [[fish]], [[coffee]], and potato chips ([[crisps]]). On a more short term basis, vacuum packing can also be used to store fresh foods, such as vegetables, meats, and liquids, because it inhibits bacterial growth.

Vacuum packing greatly reduces the bulk of non-food items. For example, clothing and bedding can be stored in bags evacuated with a domestic [[vacuum cleaner]] or a dedicated vacuum sealer. This technique is sometimes used to compact [[household waste]], for example where a charge is made for each full bag collected.

Vacuum packaging products, using [[plastic bag]]s, [[Canning|canisters]], [[bottle]]s, or [[mason jar]]s, are available for home use.

For delicate food items which might be crushed by the vacuum packing process (such as potato chips), an alternative is to replace the interior gas with nitrogen. This has the same effect of inhibiting deterioration due to the removal of oxygen.

== External sealers ==

External vacuum sealers involve a bag being attached to the vacuum-sealing machine externally. The machine will remove the air and seal the bag, which is all done outside the machine. A [[heat sealer]] is often used to seal the pack.

== Single Vacuum Chamber Machines ==
[[File:Vacuum Packaging Machine.webm|thumb|This video shows vacuum packaging of rice.]]
[[Image:Tabletop Vacuum Packaging Machine.png|thumb|right|150px|Tabletop Vacuum Packaging Machine]]
Single chamber sealers require the entire product to be placed within the machine. Like external sealers, a plastic bag is typically used for packaging. Once the product is placed in the machine, the lid is closed and air is removed. Then, there is a heat seal inside the chamber that will seal the bag, after sealing the bag the chamber is refilled with air by the automatic opening of a vent to the outside. This oncoming pressure squeezes all remaining air in the bag. The lid is then opened and the product removed. Chamber sealers are typically used for low-to-medium-volume packaging. This style of vacuum machine is also capable of sealing liquids due to equal pressure in the chamber and the bag eliminating the risk of the liquid being suck out of the open edge of the bag.

== Double Vacuum Chamber Machines ==
[[File:XtraVac Double Chamber Vacuum Packaging Machine.png|thumb|left| Double Chamber Vacuum Packaging Machine]]

Double chamber sealers require the entire product to be placed in a plastic bag within the machine. Once the product is placed in the machine on the seal bar, the lid is closed and air is removed. Then a seal bar inside the chamber seals the product in the bag, after sealing the bag the chamber is refilled with air by the automatic opening of a vent to the outside. This oncoming pressure squeezes all remaining air in the bag. The lid is then opened and the product removed. Double chamber sealers are typically used for medium-volume packaging, and also have the capability to vacuum seal liquids. The lid generally swings from one side to another, increasing production speed over a single chamber model. Double chamber vacuum packaging machines generally have either spring-weighted lids or fully automatic lids.

Double chamber vacuum packaging machines are commonly used for:
* Fresh Meat
* Processed Meat
* Cheese (hard and soft)
* Candy &amp; Chocolate

== Automatic Belt Vacuum Chamber Machines ==

[[File:VC999 K9 Automatic Belt Vacuum Chamber Machine.jpg|thumb|left|Automatic Belt Vacuum Chamber Machine. Automatic belt vacuum chamber machines offer vastly increased speed and automation and accommodate large products.]]
Automatic belt chamber sealers require the entire product to be placed in a plastic bag or flow wrapped pouch within the machine. The product travels on the conveyor belt, it is automatically positioned in the machine on the seal bar, the lid is closed and air is removed. Then a seal bar inside the chamber seals the product in the bag. After sealing the bag, the chamber is refilled with air by the automatic opening of a vent to the outside. This oncoming pressure squeezes all remaining air in the bag. The lid is then opened and the product removed. Automatic belt vacuum chamber machines are typically used for high-speed packaging of large items, and also have the capability to vacuum seal liquids. The lid generally travels straight up and down.

Automatic belt vacuum chamber packaging machines are commonly used for:
* Fresh Meat (large portions)
* Processed Meat
* Large Sausage logs
* Cheese (hard and soft)

== Thermoforming (rollstock) Vacuum Packaging Machines ==

[[File:VC999 i-Series Thermoform Packaging Machine.png|thumb|left|Thermoform packaging machines are used in larger production facilities for vacuum packaging products.]]
Vacuum Packaging in large production facilities can be done with thermoforming machines. These are Form-Fill-Seal style machines that form the package from rolls of packaging film (webbing). Products are loaded into the thermoformed pockets, the top web is laid and sealed under a vacuum, producing vacuum packaged products. Thermoforming can greatly increase packaging production speed.
Thermoformed plastics can be customized for size, color, clarity, and shape to fit products perfectly, creating a consistent appearance. One of the most commonly used thermoformed plastics is PET, known for a high-strength barrier resistant to outside tampering and an ease of molding into designated designs and shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.plasticingenuity.com/blog/pet-vs-pvc-plastics-which-material-is-better-for-packaging|title=PET vs. PVC: Which Material is Better for Packaging?|last=Ingenuity|first=Plastic|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common uses for Thermoforming in vacuum packaging include:
* Fresh &amp; Marinated Meat
* Sausage
* Cheese
* Candy / Chocolate
* Grain
* Grab-and-Go Snacks (beef jerky, snack sticks)
* Pharmaceutical and Medical Products
* Coins / Collectables

== Shelf life ==
Depending on the product, atmosphere, temperature,  and the barrier properties of the package, vacuum packaging extends the [[shelf life]] of many foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== High Barrier Shrink Vacuum Bags ==
The amount of shelf life enhanced by a vacuum bag is dependent on the structure in the material.  A standard vacuum bag is composed of a PA/PE structure where PA is for puncture resistance and PE is for sealing.  The high barrier category includes the usage of more layers focused on the prevention of oxygen permeability, and therefore shelf life protection.  There are two materials used in high barrier structures, [[polyvinylidene chloride]] (PVDC) and ethylene vinyl alcohol ([[EVOH]]).  Shelf life indication can be effectively measured by how many cubic centimeters of oxygen can permeate through 1 square meter of material over a 24-hour period.  A standard PA/PE bag allows on average 100 cubic centimeters, PVDC allows on average over 10, and EVOH on average 1 cubic centimeter.  Multi-layer structures allow the ability to use strong oxygen-barrier materials for enhanced shelf life protection.  The PremiumPack structure is a good example of EVOH based high barrier shrink material.

== Preventing freezer burn ==

When foods are frozen without preparation, [[freezer burn]] can occur.  It happens when the surface of the food is dehydrated, and this leads to a dried and leathery appearance.  Freezer burn also ruins the flavor and texture of foods.  Vacuum packing reduces freezer burn by preventing the food from exposure to the cold, dry air.

== Sous-vide cooking ==

Vacuum packaging also allows for a special cooking method, [[sous-vide]].  Sous-vide, [[French language|French]] for ''under vacuum'', involves poaching food that is vacuum sealed in a plastic bag.

==Food safety==

In an oxygen-depleted environment, [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]] can proliferate, potentially causing food-safety issues. Some pathogens of concern in vacuum packed foods are spore-forming non-proteolytic ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', [[Yersinia enterocolitica|''Yersenia enterocolitica'']], and ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=John|last2=Donnison|first2=Andrea|last3=Brightwell|first3=Gale|title=Factors affecting microbial spoilage and shelf-life of chilled vacuum-packed lamb transported to distant markets: A review|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2014.05.002|journal=Meat Science|volume=98|issue=1|pages=71–80|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2014.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacuum packing is often used in combination with other food processing techniques, such as retorting or refrigeration, to inhibit the growth of anaerobic organisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
