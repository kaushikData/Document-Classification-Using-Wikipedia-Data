      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5346">The '''Betting and Lotteries Act, 1934''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the United Kingdom and had three sections: Betting, Lotteries and Prize Competitions, and General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1934/58/pdfs/ukpga_19340058_en.pdf?timeline=true&amp;view=extent|title=Betting and Lotteries Act, 1934|publisher=Legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft bill was presented to parliament on 7 March&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=oxfshlib&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;docId=CS203237992&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=OUR PARLIAMENTARY CORRESPONDENT.

==Overview==

===Betting===
Horse racing courses and greyhound tracks were forced to limit their race days to a maximum 104 per annum whereas previously they were able to race on an unlimited basis. On course bookmakers and [[Tote board|totalisators]] were also restricted to betting on a maximum of 104 days per annum.

Power was given to local councils to issue (and revoke or refuse) the betting licences required and the 104 appointed days of trading must be published in advance. The racecourse and tracks were to charge on course bookmakers a specified admission price and it was illegal for under 18 to be involved in any betting organisation.

The issue of street bookmaking was not addressed which the press felt should have been. The restriction to 104 days was primarily brought in due to rapid growth of greyhound tracks after 1927 and the associated gambling implications that had followed.&lt;ref name=NGRC&gt;{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lotteries and Prize Competitions===
All lotteries were made unlawful with the exemption of small lotteries incidental to certain entertainment and private lotteries. Restrictions were made on certain prize competitions (i.e. in newspapers) and warrant rights were given to any constable to investigate premises that are suspected of breaking the restrictions.

This was primarily directed to combat the [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake|Irish Free State Hospitals' Sweepstake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ria.ie/Publications/Journals/PRIA-Section-C/Buy-online/PRIA-Section-C-Volume-105-5--MARIE-COLEMAN--%E2%80%98A-ter.aspx|title="A terrible danger to the morals of the country": The Irish hospitals' sweepstake in Great Britain, 1930–87|first=Marie|last=Coleman|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Section C]]|volume=105|issue=5|year=2005|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Marie|last=Coleman|title=The Irish Sweep — A History of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstake, 1930-87|publisher=University College Dublin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-906359-41-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Defending Portland (34939466302) (cropped).jpg|thumb|"All Lives Matter" sign at a rally in Portland, Oregon, on June 4, 2017]]
"'''All Lives Matter'''" ('''#AllLivesMatter''') is a slogan that has come to be associated with criticism of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Townes|first1=Carimah|title=Obama Explains The Problem With 'All Lives Matter'|url=http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/10/22/3715332/obama-explains-the-problem-with-all-lives-matter/|publisher=think progress|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan became a larger talking point in the [[2016 United States presidential election]]. 

== Supporters ==
Several notable individuals have supported All Lives Matter. Its proponents include Senator [[Tim Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Eugene|title=Tim Scott defends use of 'all lives matter'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/03/politics/tim-scott-all-lives-matter/|publisher=CNN|date=September 3, 2015|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American football player [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]] supported the All Lives Matter message, saying "I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samuel|first1=Ebenezer|title=Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman explains why he stands by that All Lives Matter|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/richard-sherman-explains-stands-lives-matter-article-1.2728272|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, Democratic presidential nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] faced backlash after using the phrase "all lives matter" at an African-American church in Missouri during her presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rappeport|first1=Alan|title=Hillary Clinton's 'All Lives Matter' Remark Stirs Backlash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/06/24/hillary-clintons-all-lives-matter-remark-stirs-backlash/|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=First Draft|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans have been stronger proponents in general of All Lives Matter and harsher critics of the Black Lives Matter movement in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/15/ben-carson-course-all-lives-matter-and-all-lives-i/|title=Ben Carson: 'Of course all lives matter — and all lives includes black lives'|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Rand Paul]] has argued that Black Lives Matter has focused on the wrong targets and has stated, "I think they should change their name maybe—if they were All Lives Matter, or Innocent Lives Matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marino|first=Gordon|year=2016|title=All Lives Matter Vs. Black Lives Matter|url=|journal=Commonweal|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] has stated that "Black Lives Matter" is a divisive term and that the term is inherently racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/three-words-that-republicans-wrestle-with-black-lives-matter/2016/07/12/f5a9dfdc-4878-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html|title=Three words that Republicans wrestle with: 'Black Lives Matter'|website=Washington Post|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an August 2015 poll, 78% of likely American voters said that the statement All Lives Matter was "close[r] to [their] own" point of view than Black Lives Matter was. Only 11% said that the statement Black Lives Matter was closer. Nine percent said that neither statement reflected their own point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2015/black_lives_matter_or_all_lives_matter |title=Black Lives Matter Or All Lives Matter? |date=August 20, 2015 |publisher=[[Rasmussen Reports]] |accessdate=July 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet facilitates the spread of the message "All Lives Matter" as a response to the Black Lives Matter hashtag as well as the "[[Blue Lives Matter]]" hashtag as a response to Beyonce's halftime performance speaking out against police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joshua-adams/alllivesmatter-needs-to-e_b_8683982.html|title=The Troll Named #AllLivesMatter|date=December 2, 2015|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.policeone.com/officer-shootings/articles/177405006-Photo-Plane-flies-Blue-Lives-Matter-banner-over-Beyonce-concert|title=Photo: Plane flies 'Blue Lives Matter' banner over Beyonce concert|website=PoliceOne|access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a performance during the [[2016 MLB All-Star Game]], Remigio Pereira, a member of [[The Tenors]], held up an "All Lives Matter" sign and altered some lyrics to the anthem "[[O Canada]]".&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shepherd|first1=Ken|title=Remigio Pereira, who worked 'All Lives Matter' into Canadian anthem, suspended from singing group|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/13/remigio-pereira-who-worked-all-lives-matter-into-c/|publisher=Washington Times|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pereira sang, "We're all brothers and sisters. All lives matter to the great," instead of the lines, "With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free."&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt; Even after criticism, he defended his statement, tweeting "I speak for the human race and the lives of all sentient beings. Love, peace, and harmony for ALL has always been my life's purpose."&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;

Some supporters have used the phrase as a way to bring communities together, feeling that the phrase "black lives matter" is too narrow. [[Max Muncy]], a professional baseball infielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers, tweeted the phrase in response to the 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/11/16/why-saying-all-lives-matter-minimizes-the-black-lives-matter-movement/|title=Why saying "All lives matter" minimizes the Black Lives Matter movement|last=Opinion|first=D. P.|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Activists from Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter made news when they embraced during a "run-in" in Dallas. "We're all brothers and sisters," one of the protesters can be heard saying on CNN. "This is how you kick down a wall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gauthier|first1=Brendan|title=WATCH: "We're all brothers and sisters": Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter activists hug it out in Dallas|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/07/12/watch_were_all_brothers_and_sisters_black_lives_matter_and_all_lives_matter_activists_hug_it_out_in_dallas/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|publisher=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, 2016, a fan at a [[Chicago Bears]] NFL game ran onto the field during a television timeout during the 4th quarter dressed in a gorilla costume, wearing a shirt that read "All Lives Matter" on the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/fan-in-gorilla-suitall-lives-matter-shirt-arrested-at-bears-game/|title=Fan in gorilla suit, All Lives Matter shirt arrested at Bears game|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to professor [[David Theo Goldberg]], "All Lives Matter" reflects a view of "racial dismissal, ignoring, and denial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why 'Black Lives Matter' Because All Lives Don't Matter in America|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-theo-goldberg/why-black-lives-matter_b_8191424.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=November 18, 2015|date=September 25, 2015|last=Goldberg|first=David Theo|authorlink=David Theo Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', [[Bill Maher]] expressed support for use of the "Black Lives Matter" phrase, stating that "'All Lives Matter' implies that all lives are equally at risk, and they're not".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRxS2Rb8Mfk|title=Bill Maher: Why Is BlackLivesMatter Going After Sympathizers Like Hillary and Bernie?|date=August 22, 2015|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founders of the Black Lives Matter movement have responded to criticism of the movement's exclusivity, saying, "#BlackLivesMatter doesn't mean your life isn't important – it means that Black lives, which are seen without value within [[White supremacy]], are important to your liberation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza – The Feminist Wire|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/|website=thefeministwire.com|accessdate=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video interview with [[Laura Flanders]], Black Lives Matter movement co-founder [[Alicia Garza]] said that "changing Black Lives Matter to All Lives Matter is a demonstration of how we don't actually understand [[Societal racism|structural racism]] in this country". She went on to say that other lives are valued more than black lives, and that to take blackness out of this equation is inappropriate.&lt;ref name=TruthOut&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flanders|first1=Laura|author-link=Laura Flanders|title=Building Movements Without Shedding Differences: Alicia Garza of #BlackLivesMatter|url=http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/29813-building-movements-without-shedding-differences-alicia-garza|accessdate=March 25, 2015|publisher=Truthout|date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] spoke to the debate between Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=President Obama defends Black Lives Matter movement|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-barack-obama-defends-black-lives-matter-movement|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said, "I think that the reason that the organizers used the phrase Black Lives Matter was not because they were suggesting that no one else's lives matter ... rather what they were suggesting was there is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that's not happening in other communities." He also said "that is a legitimate issue that we've got to address."&lt;ref name=tactics&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Bryan|title=Tactics of Black Lives Matter|url=http://kcts9.org/programs/in-close/tactics-black-lives-matter|publisher=KCTS9|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, ''[[USA Today]]'' concluded from the thoughts of [[Columbia University]] sociology professor Carla Shedd, that the phrase "'All Lives Matter' can actually be interpreted as racist". It also cited professor [[Joe Feagin]], who said that white people use the phrase "All Lives Matter" to ignore the Black Lives Matter movement, which he described as "already about liberty and justice for all." ''USA Today'' reported that some celebrities who had tweeted using the hashtag #AllLivesMatter, including [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Fetty Wap]], had deleted the tweets and apologized. It also mentioned cartoonist [[Kris Straub]], who tweeted a cartoon titled "All Houses Matter", showing a house fire, to illustrate what he saw as the problem with the term.&lt;ref name="USAToday2016-07-13"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/07/13/why-saying-all-lives-matter-opposite-black-lives-matter/87025190/ |title=#AllLivesMatter hashtag is racist, critics say |first=Ashley |last=May |date=July 13, 2016 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=July 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapper [[Fetty Wap]] apologized for using #AllLivesMatter, stating that he didn't fully understand the hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/us/all-lives-matter-black-lives-matter.html|title=Why 'All Lives Matter' Is Such a Perilous Phrase|last=Victor|first=Daniel|date=July 15, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facebook graffiti incident==
On February 24, 2016, [[Mark Zuckerberg]], CEO of Facebook, sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten "Black Lives Matter" phrases on the company walls and had written "All Lives Matter" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but "malicious as well".&lt;ref name="npr_zuckerberg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selyukh|first1=Alina|title=Zuckerberg tells Facebook staff to stop crossing out 'Black Lives Matter'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/02/26/467985384/zuckerberg-tells-facebook-staff-to-stop-crossing-out-black-lives-matter|website=npr.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zuckerberg's memo, "''Black Lives Matter'' doesn't mean other lives don't – it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve". The memo also said that the act of crossing something out in itself, "means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's".&lt;ref name="shaunking-zuckerberg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Shaun|title=Mark Zuckerberg forced to address racism among Facebook staff after vandals target Black Lives Matter phrases|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/king-mark-zuckerberg-forced-address-racism-facebook-article-1.2543985|accessdate=February 26, 2016|agency=Daily News|location=New York|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guynn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jessica|first1=Guynn|title=Zuckerberg reprimands Facebook staff defacing 'Black Lives Matter' slogan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/02/25/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter-diversity/80933694/|accessdate=February 26, 2016|work=USA Today|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="benjaminsnyder"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snyder|first1=Benjamin|title=Mark Zuckerberg Takes Facebook Workers to Task Over 'All Lives Matter' Graffiti|url=http://fortune.com/2016/02/25/mark-zuckerberg-black-lives-matter/|accessdate=February 26, 2016|work=Fortune|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early history ===
[[File:Infogrames Entertainment Logo 0.png|thumb|left|150px|An early logo used before the company's founding.]]
The founders wanted to christen the company ''Zboub Système'' (which can be approximately translated to ''Dick System'' in English), but were dissuaded by their legal counsel.&lt;ref name="Ichbiah"&gt;[[Image:Symbole-fr.png|30px|Link to a French language website]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lacnui_7yp0C&amp;pg=PT75&amp;lpg=PT75&amp;dq=Zboub+Syst%C3%A8me&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uEAJzMOtuN&amp;sig=7wfo3eT5oQS2K8PZ5_KuXHyE0JE&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RvAlVJ-WBMreaqv6gIAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Zboub%20Syst%C3%A8me&amp;f=false Excerpt] from Daniel Ichbiah, ''La saga des jeux vidéo''. Vuibert. 2004. {{ISBN|2-7117-4825-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bonnell in a TV interview, they then used a mix-and-match computer program to suggest other names, one of which was "Infogramme":  a portmanteau of the [[French language|French]] words "informatique" (information technology) and "programme" (a computer program). The final choice, "Infogrames", was a slightly modified version of that suggestion.

The company logo and mascot is an [[armadillo]] (''tatou'' in French), chosen when the company was moved to [[Villeurbanne]]. Bonnell commented: "This dinosaur {{sic}} is our symbol. The armadillo has always survived changes to its environment, from the melting of glaciers to the worst of heat waves."&lt;ref name="Ichbiah"/&gt;

In the late 1980s, Infogrames was noted for its French computer games that often featured original game ideas and occasionally humorous content. They had acquired several licences for popular [[Franco-Belgian comics]]

In 1992, they released ''[[Alone in the Dark (1992 video game)|Alone in the Dark]]'', a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[horror (genre)|horror]] [[adventure game]] to international attention.&lt;ref&gt;Fahs, Traves. [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2008/06/23/alone-in-the-dark-restrospective?page=2 Alone in the Dark Restrospective], [[IGN]], 23 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996–2002: Growth through acquisition ===
In 1996, [[Bruno Bonnell]]'s Infogrames embarked on an acquisition campaign that would last seven years and cost more than $500 million; the objective was to become the world's leading interactive entertainment publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/02-16-2000/0001142857&amp;EDATE= |title=Infogrames Launches Infogrames.com |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=16 February 2000 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the company's debt increased from $55 million in 1999 to $493 million in 2002, the company's revenue also increased from $246 million to $650 million during the same period.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/13471/The_Euro_Vision_ByeBye_Bruno.php |title=The Euro Vision: 'Bye-Bye Bruno' |publisher=Gamasutra |date=11 April 2007 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1996, Infogrames announced they would buy and merge with British company [[Ocean Software|Ocean International Ltd.]], the owners of [[Ocean Software]] and fellow-subsidiary Ocean America, for $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukbusinesspark.co.uk/bpmerg96.htm |title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions&amp;nbsp;— UK News 1996 |publisher=Ukbusinesspark.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the merger, Ocean International Ltd. was renamed to Infogrames United Kingdom, Ltd., with Infogrames retaining the Ocean Software brand until 1998.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/company/atari-uk-ltd |title=Atari UK Ltd |publisher=MobyGames |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this merger, Infogrames Entertainment S.A. classified themselves as a "Super Publisher", referring to them being the largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=European Super Publisher Emerges |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=19 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=July 1996 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Infogrames acquired Philips Multimedia BV, and transferred the multimedia software publishing and distribution activities from the company to them. The company also perchased game rights from German publisher Laguna Video Games in the same year.

In 1998, IESA acquired a majority share of 62.5% in the game distributor ''OziSoft'',&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atari.com.au/misc/faq.do |title=Frequently Asked Questions&amp;nbsp;— Atari Australia |publisher=Atari.com.au |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 IESA bought the remaining shares of ''OziSoft'' from [[Sega]] and other share holders, and renamed them to Infogrames Australia and Infogrames New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/business/soa/Ozisoft-becomes-Infogrames-Australia/0,139023166,120267724,00.htm |title=Ozisoft becomes Infogrames Australia: News&amp;nbsp;— Business&amp;nbsp;— ZDNet Australia |publisher=Zdnet.com.au |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $3.7 million.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7" /&gt;  Also in 1998 the distributors ABS Multimedia, Arcadia and the Swiss Gamecity GmbH were acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.claimexam.com/links/Done/accolade.htm |title=Portail d'informations |publisher=Claimexam.com |date=5 August 1973 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.infogrames.com/uk/download/reports/infogrames_entertainment_annual_report_99_00.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709174620/http://corporate.infogrames.com/uk/download/reports/infogrames_entertainment_annual_report_99_00.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, IESA bought [[Gremlin Interactive]], alongside [[DMA Design]] for $40 million, and renamed the developer to ''Infogrames Sheffield House''.  Infogrames though would later sell off DMA Design to Take-Two Interactive in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Infogrames+Buys+UK+Games+Company+Gremlin.-a054207493 |title=Infogrames Buys UK Games Company Gremlin. |publisher=[[TheFreeLibrary.com]] |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, IESA also bought [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] for $60 million which was renamed as ''Infogrames North America, Inc.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CGN/is_1999_April_20/ai_54426666 |title=France's Infogrames Grows in US With $60m Accolade Buy &amp;#124; Computergram International &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/vidgame/vid1999.htm |title=Chronology of Video Game Systems (1999) |publisher=Islandnet.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Beam Software]], which was renamed to ''Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/company/krome-studios-melbourne |title=Krome Studios Melbourne |publisher=MobyGames |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in December 1999, IESA made one of the most expensive acquisitions in the company's history. Infogrames bought 70% of [[GT Interactive]] for $135 million, and assumed the new subsidiary's $75 million bank debt. By June 2000 Infogrames had invested another $30 million in GT Interactive.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/business/infogrames-gets-control-of-gt-interactive.html |title=Infogrames Gets Control of GT Interactive&amp;nbsp;— New York Times |publisher=New York Times |date=16 November 1999 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IESA justified the purchase by stating that GT Interactive provided Infogrames with a  "distribution network for all of its products in the United States, as well as a catalog of products that includes [[Driver (game)|Driver]], [[Duke Nukem]], [[Oddworld]], [[Unreal Tournament]] and [[Deer Hunter (series)|Deer Hunter]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

Included in the GT Interactive purchase were the game development studios [[SingleTrac]], [[Humongous Entertainment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/GT-Interactive-Software-Company-History.html |title=GT Interactive Software&amp;nbsp;— Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legend Entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1592004938 |title=Game Design, Second Edition: Bob Bates: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reflections Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atnewyork.com/news/article.php/249211 |title=Gt Interactive Hires Disney Honcho, Raises Cash |publisher=Atnewyork.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112151412/http://www.atnewyork.com/news/article.php/249211 |archivedate=12 January 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GT Interactive became '''Infogrames, Inc'''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.infogrames.com/MT-3.34-en/mt-static/FCKeditor/UserFiles/File/DOCDEREF05_06GB.pdf |title=Microsoft Word&amp;nbsp;— couverture_GB.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127234614/http://corporate.infogrames.com/MT-3.34-en/mt-static/FCKeditor/UserFiles/File/DOCDEREF05_06GB.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the developer [[Paradigm Entertainment]] was bought for $19.5 million and in-flight games developer Den-o-Tech Int. (DTI) , later renamed to ''Infogrames DTI'', was also acquired for $5.6 million.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated6" /&gt;

In the same year, Infogrames, Inc. acquired Infogrames North America, Inc. and both companies were merged into the former.

In January 2001, IESA purchased '''[[Hasbro Interactive]]''' and the [[handheld game console]] ''[[Game.com]]'' from [[Hasbro]] for $100 million; with $95 million as 4.5 million common shares of Infogrames and $5 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/business/company-news-hasbro-completes-sale-of-interactive-business.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FBusiness%2FCompanies%2FHasbro+Inc |title=Company News; Hasbro Completes Sale Of Interactive Business&amp;nbsp;— New York Times |publisher=New York Times |date=30 January 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=68329&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_Print&amp;ID=137281&amp;highlight= |title=Press Release |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |date=6 December 2000 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the acquisition of Hasbro Interactive, which was renamed as '''Infogrames Interactive, Inc,'''&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&amp;sql=3:23597 |title=((( Atari Interactive, Inc. &gt; Overview ))) |publisher=allgame |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/atari-8-bit/faq/section-85.html |title=11.2) What is the History of Atari? |publisher=Faqs.org |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; IESA became the owner of:
* The [[MicroProse]] brand and titles, including ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'', ''[[Falcon (computer game)|Falcon]]'', and ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon (video game)|RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'';
* The [[Atari]] name and properties, such as ''[[Centipede (arcade game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Missile Command]]'', and ''[[Pong]]''.

Also under the terms of the sale agreement, Infogrames gained the exclusive rights to develop and publish games based on Hasbro properties, which included ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', ''[[Mr. Potato Head]]'', ''[[My Little Pony]]'' and others, for a period of 15 years plus an option for an additional 5 years based on performance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5" /&gt;

=== 2001–2003 ===
In October 2001, Infogrames announced that it was "reinventing" the Atari brand (Which they acquired from Hasbro Interactive which they used as a brand for arcade game remakes) with the launch of three new games featuring prominent Atari branding on their boxarts: ''[[Splashdown (video game)|Splashdown]]'', ''[[MX Rider]]'' and ''[[TransWorld Surf]]''.&lt;ref name="returnofataribrand"&gt;{{cite web |title=Infogrames ready to ship first games under Atari brand |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=31 October 2001 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/infogrames-ready-to-ship-first-games-under-atari-brand/1100-2821519/ |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand was a success for Infogrames, and they continued to use Atari as a brand name for console games aimed at 18-34 year olds. PC, educational and casual games retained the Infogrames banner.

MicroProse's UK studio in Chipping Sodbury was closed on 20 September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parker |first=Sam |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2880148.html |title=Infogrames closes UK MicroProse studio&amp;nbsp;— News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the release of the last game under the MicroProse name, [[Grand Prix 4]].

In the same year, IESA acquired the remaining 80% of [[game development studio]] [[Eden Games]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Strohm |first=Axel |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/driving/vrally3/news.html?sid=2860904 |title=Infogrames buys Eden Studios&amp;nbsp;— PlayStation 2 News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=22 October 2002 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $4.1 million.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7" /&gt; In May, [[Shiny Entertainment]] was bought from [[Interplay Entertainment]] for $47 million. With Eden Games, IESA would publish all of Eden Games' titles, such as ''[[V-Rally 3]]'' and later ''[[Test Drive Unlimited]]'', and with the Shiny Entertainment acquisition, IESA obtained the rights to develop and publish ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' which was the first game based on ''[[The Matrix]]'' films and sold more than 5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/news/04_25_02_01_49PM.htm |title=Infogrames Acquires both Shiny Entertainment and Exclusive Matrix License&amp;nbsp;— PC News |publisher=Pc.gamezone.com |date= |accessdate=2 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706175511/http://pc.gamezone.com/news/04_25_02_01_49PM.htm |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite restructuring, Infogrames continued to struggle to become profitable. For the 2008 fiscal year the company posted €51.1 million ($72.17 million) in net losses and for the 2009 fiscal year, which ended in March, Infogrames posted losses of €226.1 million ($319.33 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23813 |title=News&amp;nbsp;— Infogrames Renames To Atari, Posts Heavy Losses, Envisages Profit |publisher=Gamasutra |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transition from Infogrames Entertainment ===
[[File:Infogrames logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|The final Infogrames logo (2000–2003)]]
During their fiscal year meeting (May 2009), IESA announced that it would be changing its corporate name to an Atari branded name, in line with the use of the name for its subsidiaries. In reference to this, Atari, Inc's CEO Jim Wilson said: ''"We've gotten rid of the Infogrames and Atari duality, the confusion around that. We are one simplified company, under one management team, under one brand."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haywald|first1=Justin|title=Atari Sheds Infogrames Branding|url=http://www.1up.com/news/atari-sheds-infogrames-branding|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=22 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605030209/http://www.1up.com/news/atari-sheds-infogrames-branding|archivedate=5 June 2011|date=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infogrames' 29 May earnings report stated:
:"''The Board agreed to change Infogrames Entertainment's name to Atari. This decision will enable us to make the best use of the Atari brand, capitalizing on worldwide strong name recognition and affinity, which are keys drivers to implement the Company's online, product and licensing strategies.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infogrames Entertainment Fiscal Year 2008/2009 Earnings|url=https://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/052909PR_FY09_earnings_GB_FINAL2.pdf|publisher=Infogrames|accessdate=22 May 2018|format=PDF|date=29 May 2009}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earnings press release on 24 July 2009 also provided clarification regarding the ensuing name change that was initially announced some two months prior, rebranding themselves as Atari, SA from Infogrames Entertainment, SA. Furthermore, this release also stated their intentions of henceforth utilizing the much more recognizable 'Atari Group' moniker with all Atari-related brands and similar such subsidiaries already under their control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atari announces 30.1% revenue growth to €54.5 million for the 1st quarter of fiscal year 2009/2010|url=https://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/D2-072409PR_FY09_1Q_revenues_GB_FINAL.pdf|publisher=Atari SA|accessdate=22 May 2018|format=PDF|date=24 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053142/http://atari.com/sites/default/files/D2-072409PR_FY09_1Q_revenues_GB_FINAL.pdf#|archive-date=25 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BlueBay restructuring ===
On 21 October 2010, Atari announced Atari's reference shareholders BlueBay Value Recovery (Master) Fund Limited and BlueBay Multi-Strategy (Master) Fund Limited are exploring a disposal of the shares and equity-linked instruments held by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATARI: Atari: Proposed transfer by BlueBay of its holding in ATARI|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/21/idUS217241+21-Oct-2010+HUG20101021|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=23 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715091422/https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/21/idUS217241+21-Oct-2010+HUG20101021|archivedate=15 July 2015|date=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, BlueBay shareholders later interrupted the sale process of its holding in Atari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BlueBay to interrupt the sale process of its holding in Atari|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/31/idUS226437+31-Jan-2011+HUG20110131|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=23 May 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715065506/https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/31/idUS226437+31-Jan-2011+HUG20110131|archivedate=15 July 2015|date=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; BlueBay later converted the conversion of a portion of the ORANEs held by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1 ST HALF OF FY 2011/2012 RESULTS|url=https://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/ATA_20112011-HY_Results_20111108_UK.pdf|publisher=Atari SA|accessdate=23 May 2018|format=PDF|date=8 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309223300/https://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/ATA_20112011-HY_Results_20111108_UK.pdf#|archive-date=9 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Atari, SA, BlueBay Value Recovery (Master) Fund Limited, and The BlueBay Multi-Strategy (Master)
Fund Limited reached an agreement following their negotiations regarding the restructuring of the debt and capital structure of the Atari group. As part of the agreement, the €20.9 million Credit Facility Agreement was extinguished via €10.9 million loan forgiveness from BlueBay Value Recovery (Master) Fund Limited and Atari's payment of €10 million; the cancellation of the dilutive effect of the ORANEs held by BlueBay; €20 million capital increases to be submitted to the vote of Atari shareholders (of which €10 million with preferential subscription right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atari SA and BlueBay reached a agreement for the restructuring of the debt and capital structure of the group|url=https://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/Atari_pr_restructuring_20120928_UK.pdf|publisher=Atari SA|accessdate=23 May 2018|format=PDF|date=28 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305112519/https://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/Atari_pr_restructuring_20120928_UK.pdf#|archive-date=5 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bankruptcy ===
On 21 January 2013, Atari, Inc., Atari Interactive, Inc., Humongous, Inc. and California US Holdings, Inc. (collectively, the "Companies") filed petitions for relief under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code]] in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atari-files-for-chapter-11-to-separate-from-french-parent-187698581.html |title=Atari Files For Chapter 11 To Separate From French Parent |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=21 January 2013 |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turnaround strategy ===
In 2015, Atari announced a turnaround strategy that would focus on re-releasing the catalog of Atari games. The strategy is focused on "download games, MMO games, mobile games and licensing activities, based in priority around traditional franchises."

Projects currently in production or included in the turnaround strategy include:
* ''[[Alone in the Dark: Illumination]]'' for PC (solo or multiplayer action and adventure game), in which players face off against Eldricht's hordes using supernatural illumination powers to defend themselves, survive and complete the adventure. Upon release the game was met with negative reception.
* ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon World]]'' for PC (offline or online, solo or multiplayer game), enabling players to create original theme parks with incredible attractions. This is the follow-up to ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon 3]]'' for PC.
* ''[[Lunar Lander (1979 video game)|Lunar Lander]]'' for mobile, the famous lunar landing simulation game that helped build ATARI's success in the past in the arcade game sector and will now delight nostalgic fans of the franchise on smartphones and tablets.&lt;ref name="2014/2015report"&gt;{{cite web|title=2014-15 full-year consolidated earnings|url=http://news.calyptus.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ATA-PressRelease_FY14-15_20150629_EN.pdf|publisher=Atari SA|accessdate=24 May 2018|format=PDF|date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship by Twitter==
{{see also|Twitter suspensions}}
According to the Terms of Service agreed upon by users of Twitter, the web site may suspend accounts, temporarily or permanently, from their social networking service. One such example is on 18 December 2017 where it banned the accounts belonging to [[Paul Golding]], [[Jayda Fransen]], [[Britain First]], [[Traditionalist Worker Party]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2018, Twitter rolled out a Quality Filter, nicknamed QFD. It hides content and users deemed "low quality" from search results, and limits their visibility, leading to accusations of "[[shadow banning]]". After conservatives claimed it censors users from the political right, [[Alex Thomson (journalist)|Alex Thomson]], a [[Vice Media|VICE]] writer, confirmed that many prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians had been "shadow banned" by the Quality Filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43paqq/twitter-is-shadow-banning-prominent-republicans-like-the-rnc-chair-and-trump-jrs-spokesman|title=Twitter appears to have fixed “shadow ban” of prominent Republicans like the RNC chair and Trump Jr.’s spokesman|work=VICE News|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later reported that Twitter announced that they would issue a "fix" in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/vbj7w3/twitter-appears-to-have-fixed-search-problems-that-lowered-visibility-of-gop-lawmakers|title=Twitter appears to have fixed search problems that lowered visibility of GOP lawmakers|work=VICE News|access-date=2018-08-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Internet shutdown, engineers at [[Google]], [[Twitter]], and SayNow, a voice-messaging startup company acquired by Google in January, announced the [[Speak To Tweet]] service. Google stated in its official blog that the goal of the service was to assist Egyptian protesters in staying connected during the Internet shutdown.&lt;ref name="Google Blog"&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Ujjwal|title=Some weekend work that will (hopefully allow more Egyptians to be heard.|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/some-weekend-work-that-will-hopefully.html |publisher=Google|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users could phone in a "tweet" by leaving a voicemail and use the Twitter hashtag #Egypt. These comments could be accessed without an Internet connection by dialing the same designated phone numbers. Those with Internet access could listen to the comments by visiting twitter.com/speak2tweet.

On February 2 connectivity was re-established by the four main Egyptian service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12346929|title=Egypt internet comes back online|date=2 February 2011|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asert.arbornetworks.com/2011/02/egypt-returns-to-the-internet/|title=Egypt Returns to the Internet|author=Craig Labovitz|publisher=Arbor Networks|date=2 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025112723/http://asert.arbornetworks.com/2011/02/egypt-returns-to-the-internet/|archivedate=25 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/02/egypt-returns-to-the-internet.shtml|title=Egypt Returns To The Internet|publisher=Renesys|author=James Cowie|date=2 February 2011|access-date=2012-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205190100/http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/02/egypt-returns-to-the-internet.shtml#|archive-date=2011-02-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, the heavy filtering that occurred at the height of the revolution had ended.

==France==
{{main|Internet censorship in France}}
Following the posting of an [[Anti-Semitism in 21st century France|antisemitic]] and racists posts by anonymous users, Twitter removed those posts from its service.  Lawsuits were filed by the Union of Jewish Students (UEJF), a French advocacy group and, on 24 January 2013, Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud ordered Twitter to divulge the [[personally identifiable information]] about the user who posted the antisemitic post, charging that the posts violated French laws against [[hate speech]].  Twitter responded by saying that it was "reviewing its options" regarding the French charges.  Twitter was given two weeks to comply with the court order before daily fines of €1,000 (about US$1,300) would be assessed.  Issues over jurisdiction arise, because Twitter has no offices nor employees within France, so it is unclear how a French court could sanction Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pfanner|first=Eric|title=In a French Case, a Battle to Unmask Twitter Users|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/technology/twitter-ordered-to-help-reveal-sources-of-anti-semitic-posts.html|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=24 January 2013|author2=Somini Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French court rules on hate tweets|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Technology/2013/01/25/French-court-rules-on-hate-tweets/UPI-38951359153077/|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=[[UPI]]|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marchive|first=Valéry|title=Twitter ordered to give up details of racist users|url=http://www.zdnet.com/twitter-ordered-to-give-up-details-of-racist-tweeters-7000010283/|work=ZDNet|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Internet in North Korea}}
From April 2016, North Korea started to block Twitter, "in a move underscoring its concern with the spread of online information". Anyone trying to access it, such as foreign visitors, even with special permission from the North Korean government, will be subject to punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = North Korea blocks Facebook, Twitter and YouTuber| work = [[The Associated Press]]| date = 4 April 2016| accessdate =4 April 2016| url = http://globalnews.ca/news/2616449/north-korea-blacks-facebook-twitter-and-youtube/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Internet censorship in Pakistan}}

As of May 2014, Twitter regularly disables the ability to view specific "tweets" inside Pakistan, at the request of the government of Pakistan on the grounds that they are [[blasphemy|blasphemous]], having done so five times in that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/world/asia/twitter-agrees-to-block-blasphemous-tweets-in-pakistan.html|date=2014-05-22|access-date=2017-01-24|title=Twitter Agrees to Block 'Blasphemous' Tweets in Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2017, the NetBlocks internet shutdown observatory and [[Digital Rights Foundation]] collected evidence of nation-wide blocking of Twitter alongside other social media services, imposed by the government in response to the violent [[2017 Tehreek-e-Labaik protest|Tehreek-e-Labaik protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://digitalrightsfoundation.pk/press-release-drf-and-netblocks-find-blanket-and-nation-wide-ban-on-social-media-in-pakistan-and-demand-it-to-be-lifted-immediately/|title=DRF and NetBlocks find blanket and nation-wide ban on social media in Pakistan and demand it to be lifted immediately|last=|first=|date=2017-11-26|work=Digital Rights Foundation|access-date=2017-11-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.com.pk/27-Nov-2017/activists-assail-blanket-ban-on-social-media|title=Activists assail blanket ban on social media|last=|first=|date=2017-11-27|work=The Nation|access-date=2017-11-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samaa.tv/social-buzz/2017/11/need-know-nation-wide-internet-disruptions-dharna/|title=All you need to know about nation-wide internet disruptions during dharna|last=|first=|date=2017-11-27|website=Samaa TV|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical investigation found that all major Pakistani fixed-line and mobile service providers were affected by the restrictions, which were lifted by the PTA the next day when protests abated following the resignation of [[Minister for Law and Justice (Pakistan)|Minister for Law and Justice]] [[Zahid Hamid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nation.com.pk/26-Nov-2017/the-issue-of-social-media-networking|title=The issue of social media networking|last=|first=|date=2017-11-26|work=The Nation|access-date=2017-11-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2014, Twitter blocked a pro-Ukrainian political account for Russian users. It happened soon after, a Russian official had threatened to ban Twitter entirely if it refused to delete "tweets" that violated Russian law, according to the Russian news site Izvestia.&lt;ref name="ru1"&gt;[http://mashable.com/2014/05/19/twitter-blocks-account-russia/ "Twitter Blocks Pro-Ukrainian Political Account for Russian Users"], Brian RiesMay, Mashable, 19 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Korea==
{{main|Internet censorship in South Korea}}
In August 2010, the [[Government of South Korea]] tried to block certain content on Twitter due to the [[North Korean government]] opening a Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/20/AR2010082005741.html |title=South Korea tries to block Twitter messages from North |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= August 21, 2010|accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Korean Twitter account created on August 12, [https://twitter.com/uriminzok uriminzok], loosely translated to mean "our people" in Korean, acquired over 4,500 followers in less than one week.

==Turkey==
{{main|Censorship in Turkey}}

On 21 March 2014, access to Twitter was blocked when a court ordered that "protection measures" be applied to the service. This followed earlier remarks by Prime Minister [[Tayyip Erdogan]] who vowed to "wipe out Twitter" following damaging allegations of [[2013 corruption scandal in Turkey|corruption in his inner circle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26677134 "Twitter website 'blocked' in Turkey"], ''BBC News'', 20 March 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4501">The '''color killer''' is an electronic stage in color [[TV]] receiver sets which acts as a cutting circuit to cut off the color amplifiers when the TV receives a [[monochrome]] signal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/color+killer+circuit thefreedictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monochromatic transmission ==
When a receiver is tuned to a monochrome transmission, the displayed scene should have no color components. However, there are two factors which result in color display even during monochrome transmission:
* a high frequency component of the luminance signal
* a high frequency of external noise

When the frequencies of these signals equals the frequency of the color subcarrier wave, they may create an irritating color dot pattern like ''confetti'', which interferes with the monochrome picture.

== Color transmission ==
In a color TV waveform, a reference pulse, called the [[colorburst|burst]],{{efn|name=burst}} is transmitted along the [[back porch]] portion of the video signal. If the transmitted signal is monochromatic, then the burst is not transmitted. The color killer is actually a muting circuit in the chroma section which supervises the burst and turns off the color amplifiers if no burst is received (i.e. when the received signal is monochromatic.)&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Grob-Charles E.Herndon:''Basic television and Video systems'', Glanceo McGraw Hill, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-02-800437-2}}, p. 456–458.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equation ==
In [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] transmissions, the color TV signal can be represented as:{{efn|name=SECAM}}

:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = E_y(t)+ a_1\cdot(E_b(t)-E_y(t))\cdot \sin(\omega t)+ a_2\cdot(E_r(t)-E_y(t))\cdot \cos(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; are attenuation factors, &lt;math&gt;E_y &lt;/math&gt; is the [[luminance]] signal, &lt;math&gt;(E_b-E_y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(E_r-E_y)&lt;/math&gt; are the so-called color difference signals and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the angular frequency of the color carrier. &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is within the luminance bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;For more complete equation see ''Reference Data for Radio Engineers'', Howard W. Sams Co, {{ISBN|978-0-672-21218-5}}, pp. 30–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color eraser (''Mehikon'') ==
In the '70s, the Israeli government considered the import of color televisions as frivolous and a luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] to cease broadcasting in color.  As it was impractical to strip out the chrominance signal from material recorded in color, this was accomplished by simply omitting the [[burst phase]] signal from the broadcast.  The "damaged" signal triggered the "color killer" mechanism, installed in color TV sets to prevent the appearance of color. This method was named ''Mehikon'' ({{lang-he|מחיקון}} "eraser").

Soon after its introduction of the "Color eraser", special TV sets with an ''Anti-Mehikon'' ({{lang-he|אנטי-מחיקון}} "anti-eraser") device were offered. This device re-constructed the burst phase signal according to several known standards. The client had to turn a knob until the pictures on the screen appeared in natural colors. According to a report in ''[[Yediot Aharonoth]]'' from January 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Report from 19 January 1979 by Leah Etgar on Yediot Aharonot's economic supplement ("HaLirot Shelkha"), partially cited in "The Future that was: Anti-Mekhikon", a historical review by Gal Mor, [[Ynet]], 7 June 2004 (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; clients had to adjust the knob every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colors or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.

Based on information from owners of electricity appliance stores, the report estimated that 90% of those who bought color TV sets also bought the ''Anti-Mehikon'' device, which added about 5–10% to the price of the television.

Eventually, the Mehikon idea was proven to be futile, and the Israeli television stopped using it in 1980, allowing color transmissions to be received freely.

The game was released in North America on November 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/gaming/hell-yes/contra-4-dated-and-box-arted-307267.php Hell Yes: Contra 4 Dated And Box Arted&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/68qZzdQWk?url=http://kotaku.com/307267/contra-4-dated-and-box-arted?tag=gaminghellyes |date=2012-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contra 4'' was produced by Konami Digital Entertainment in America and developed by [[WayForward Technologies]], making it the first ''Contra'' game developed by them, as well as the first original ''Contra'' game for a portable platform since the 1991 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Operation C (video game)|Operation C]]''. ''Contra 4'' was designed to be a direct sequel to the ''Contra'' games for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]'', ''[[Super Contra|Super C]]'', and ''[[Contra III: The Alien Wars]]''), with a gameplay model similar to those games, and was also in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the original ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]''.

A mobile phone port was released on November 19, 2007.&lt;ref name=IGN-review&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Levi|title=Contra 4 Mobile Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/20/contra-4-mobile-review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=September 28, 2015|date=November 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The plot is set in 2638, two years after the events of ''[[Contra III: The Alien Wars]]'' and three years before the events of ''[[Contra: Hard Corps]]''. With the Red Falcon alien threat defeated and Alien Wars finished, the Earth is peaceful once again. However, a similar alien entity calling itself Black Viper begins launching attacks against the human race, causing mass destruction over the planet. After strange readings are detected at the Galuga archipelago (the setting of the original ''Contra''), the Earth Federation sends their four strongest Contra Force commandos on a final strike mission to destroy the Black Viper and its army of aliens, robots, and mutants.

The continuity of ''Contra 4'' is based on the Japanese canon that was adapted into the English localization of series with the release of ''Contra: Shattered Soldier''. However, the game's producers took a number of liberties with the established canon by integrating elements of the American localizations of the older games, thus fusing the two versions together. The alien Black Viper was originally mentioned only in the North American manual of ''[[Operation C (video game)|Operation C]]'', whereas the original plot of that game (released as simply "Contra" in Japan) was about an unnamed superpower creating new weapons using an alien cell. In the timeline presented in the manual and official website, the events of ''Operation C'' are interpreted as a previous mission of "Mad Dog" and "Scorpion" - two new characters created specifically for ''Contra 4'', against the Black Viper. In actuality, "Mad Dog" and "Scorpion" were the names used for Bill and Lance for the North American NES games (see playable characters section for details). Additionally, ''Operation C'' was originally a solo mission of Lance Bean, aka Scorpion (as the game was one-player only).

==Gameplay==
[[Image:contra4cast.jpg|thumb|225px|left|The cast of ''Contra 4''. From left to right: Mad Dog, Bill Rizer, Lance Bean, and Scorpion]]
''Contra 4'' is based on the same 2D gameplay system featured in the series through ''[[Contra III: The Alien Wars]]'', ignoring many of the game mechanics introduced in later games such as the fixed weapon configurations in ''[[Contra: Shattered Soldier]]'' and ''[[Neo Contra]]'', returning to the old method of picking up power-up icons to obtain new weapons. The play controls are similar to ''Contra III: The Alien Wars'', including the ability to hold two weapons in inventory. The action spans both screens of the Nintendo DS system and a [[grappling hook]] can be used by the player's character to latch onto railings, allowing the player's character to move from one screen to the other. Similarly to the arcade version of ''[[Super Contra]]'', the player can pick up the same power-up twice, giving them an improved version of the same weapon. The player can also discard a power-up, allowing them to try out a new weapon without losing a previous one.

In addition to the standard side view stages, there are also tunnel stages similar to the two "3D view" stages from the original ''[[Contra (video game)|Contra]]'', in which the perspective shifts behind the character's back. The action in these stages is displayed solely on the upper screen, while the bottom screen is used to display the stage's map and the locations of power-ups. Other than using both screens, ''Contra 4'' makes no usage of the DS' special features such as touch screen (besides navigating the main menu), microphone, or multiplayer modes.

===Arcade Mode===
Arcade Mode is the main portion of the game, which is composed of six standard stages and three tunnel stages, for a total of nine stages. The stages pay frequent homage to ''Contra'', ''Super Contra'' (''Super C'' on the NES), ''Operation C'' and ''Contra III: The Alien Wars''. Three difficulty settings are available: easy, normal, and hard. Easy is intended to be accessible to novices by providing the player with plenty of lives and credits, as well as making all power-ups upgraded by default, but does not give the player access to the final two stages nor the ending. Normal is a moderate setting described to be "as difficult as the original ''Contra''", whereas Hard features faster moving enemies and enemy fire, with fewer lives. Hard mode also features a different ending from Normal.

===Challenge Mode===
After completing the main game (Arcade Mode) once on any difficulty setting, a Challenge Mode will be made available in the main menu. This game mode is composed of forty different challenges in which the player must complete various tasks within the side-scrolling stages of Arcade Mode.

===Music===
The music and sound effects were handled by famed videogame music remixer [[Jake Kaufman]], who also composed for ''[[Shantae]]'' and founded the game music remix site VGMix. The soundtrack consists of a few arrangements of music from previous ''Contra'' games as well as new material. When Arcade Mode is played on the Hard setting, an arranged version of the Jungle theme from the original ''Contra'' is played instead of the standard stage music. The standard Jungle theme is actually an enhanced version of a "Contra style" [[chiptune]] song previously posted on Kaufman's website, called "Vile Red Falcon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=August 2007|issue=218|periodical=Nintendo Power|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e7piDXqqHE Vile Red Falcon (Contra) by Virt]&lt;/ref&gt;

A soundtrack CD has been announced by Konami to be bundled in the first print of the Japanese release of Contra: Dual Spirits, as a gift for preorders through the KonamiStyle shop. This deal is only available for Japanese residents. In addition to the music found in the game, a 4-minute live performance of the "Harbor" song is included as a bonus track. The song is performed by The Smash Bros, Jake Kaufman's video game tribute band.

He notes with pride that his patrons will not find such gimmicks in his plays.
The dance can be compared with the modern ''[[Tsifteteli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;hl=el&amp;q=cordax+tsifteteli&amp;btnG=#hl=el&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YFViTpfjA9KM4gSb0LCjCg&amp;ved=0CCgQBSgA&amp;q=%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B4%CE%B1%CE%BE+%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B9%CF%86%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B9&amp;spell=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=95cd58ce19f03be8&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=860 Tsifteteli - kordax], ''Hē Lexē'': volumes 21-28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petronius Arbiter]] in his [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[novel]] the ''[[Satyricon]]'' has Trimalchio boast to his dinner guests that no one dances the cordax better than his wife, Fortunata. The nature of this dance is described in the [[satires of Juvenal]], who says "the girls encouraged by applause sink to the ground with tremulous buttocks." The poet [[Horace]] and playwright [[Plautus]] refer to the same dance as ''iconici motus''.

Juvenal makes specific mention of the ''testarum crepitus'' (clicking of castanets). In the earlier Greek form, finger cymbals were used.

'''Dramatic conventions''' are the specific actions and  techniques the actor, writer or director has employed to create a desired dramatic effect/style.

A ''dramatic convention'' is a set of [[wiktionary:rule|rules]] which both the audience and [[actor]]s are familiar with and which act as a useful way of quickly signifying the nature of the action or of a character.

All forms of theatre have dramatic conventions, some of which may be unique to that particular form, such as the poses used by actors in Japanese [[kabuki]] theatre to establish a character, or the [[stock character]] of the black-cloaked, moustache twirling villain in early cinema [[melodrama]] serials.

It can also include an implausible facet of a performance required by the technical limitations or artistic nature of a production and which is accepted by the audience as part of [[suspension of disbelief]]. For example, a dramatic convention in [[Shakespeare]] is that a character can move downstage to deliver a [[soliloquy]] which cannot be heard by the other characters on stage nor are characters in a [[Musical theatre|musical]] surprised by another character bursting into song. One more example would be how the audience accepts the passage of time during a play or how music will play during a romantic scene.

Dramatic conventions may be categorized into groups, such as rehearsal, technical or theatrical.
Rehearsal conventions can include hot seating, role on the wall and still images. Technical conventions can include lighting, dialogue, monologue, set, costuming and entrances/exits. Theatrical conventions may include split focus, flashback/flashforward, narration, soliloquy and spoken thought.

'''El Mokhtar''' (February 9, 1971 – December 31, 1983) was an [[Arabian horse]], and one of three black Arabian [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]]s used to portray "The Black" in the second [[The Black Stallion (film)|''Black Stallion'' film]], ''[[The Black Stallion Returns]].''

El Mokhtar was imported by a syndicate of American Arabian breeders in 1975. El Mokhtar was of Egyptian Arabian bloodlines, rarely shown, and originally not even broke to ride because he was considered so valuable. The American Arabian enthusiast knew him from a few ads in magazines, but no super-hype promotion surrounded his breeding career.

==''The Black Stallion''==

Shortly after his arrival in America, El Mokhtar was seen by ''[[The Black Stallion]]'' author [[Walter Farley]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} An offer was made for El Mokhtar's services for the role of 'The Black' for the first [[The Black Stallion (film)|''Black Stallion'' film]], but it was firmly declined by his syndicate. ''Black Stallion'' trainer Corky Randall also liked El Mokhtar, and, at Randall's urging, the movie studio bought out the entire 40-member syndicate in order to secure El Mokhtar for the [[The Black Stallion Returns|second ''Black Stallion'' film]]. 

El Mokhtar was one of three black Arabian stallions used to portray the Black in the second film. The director loved his huge, expressive eyes, so he appears in several close-up shots. More important to the film was how El Mokhtar could run; he is the Black in the cross-country race. The native extras riding the other horses were urged to make a real race of it. The 'come from behind' win of 'The Black' is the product of a real race. 

El Mokhtar was also trained to do the 'courting' scenes with the gray gelding Talishma, who played the mare Johar in the film. Those scenes were scheduled as the last to be shot. Just prior to the filming date, El Mokhtar developed a severe case of [[horse colic]]. No modern veterinary facility was available in Morocco, making surgery impossible, and as a result, El Mokhtar was humanely destroyed on the set December 31, 1983. An [[autopsy]] revealed a severe twist, and a rupture; even if surgery had been possible, it is very unlikely he would have survived. 

El Mokhtar was unusually tall for a purebred Arabian, and very 'Egyptian' in type with a long, clean-cut neck, small head, and fine boned for his size. El Mokhtar was not only a good athlete - the work in the Black Stallion film was strenuous and demanding - but he also had a very good nature and was a willing performer. Corky Randall said, "He just never did anything wrong."

'''''El Show de las Doce''''' was a Venezuelan [[variety show]] that was shown on [[RCTV|Radio Caracas Televisión]] between 1954 and 1964.  It was created and hosted by [[Víctor Saume]].

==History==
''El Show de las Doce'' was the first daytime television show in the history of Venezuelan television. For many years, channels 5 (Televisora Nacional) and channel 4 (Televisa) only began in the evenings. Produced by Corpa Publicidad, sponsored by [[Lucky Strike|Lucky Strike Cigarettes]] (later by Añejo Santa Teresa, a brand of [[rum]]), and hosted exclusively by Víctor Saume, this program began in mid-1954 and was shown between 12:00 noon and 1:30pm, Mondays and Saturdays. It was live, with an audience in the studio. The show was usually made in studio 9, which was used for shows with big audiences, though occasionally it would be produced in studio 15, located in the current Miniteatro del Este de Plaza Venezuela. It was one of the few shows in Venezuela that managed to maintain its original set design throughout its run.

Although Saume was the central figure of this show, other hosts assiste on occasions. It was even hosted by José Luis Sarzalejo for a period of five years. The show was also hosted by Héctor Monteverde, Félix Cardona Moreno, Charles Barry, and Luis Brito Arocha. When it came time to announce the commercial break, Saume came up with the [[catch phrase]] "Vamos arriba" ("going up"). [[Renny Ottolina]], considered Saume's successor by some people, perfected the catch phrase by including the word "master" ("Vamos a master" or "lets go to the master"). ''El Show de las Doce'' brought to its audience international superstars such as [[Pedro Infante]], [[Libertad Lamarque]], [[Olga Guillot]], [[Celia Cruz]] and La Sonora Matancera, La Tongolele, Miguel Aceves Mejía and [[Lola Flores]]. Venezuelan artists who appeared on the show included  [[Alfredo Sadel]], Héctor Cabrera, Los Torrealberos, Magdalena Sánchez, Rosa Virginia Chacín, Cherry Navarro, and Chelique Sarabia. One of the show's segments, "La gran cruzada del buen humor", later gave birth to ''[[Radio Rochela|Radio Rochela Televisión]]'' (the original name of this comedy show). This segment could be seen on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, for 15 minutes.

"In little time, it was converted in the most popular program in television. Those who came from other places in the country went directly to Uncle Saume, because somebody recommended to go to him. It was frequent the visits from those who wanted to know something publicly." (Edith Guzmán, ''[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]'', September 29, 1974, ten years after the death of Saume).

In 1960, the program became known simply as ''El Show de Saume''. At the beginning of 1964, it was dfound that Saume had some respiratory problems, and the show ended on March 15, 1964, eight months before his death.

'''Electrostep''' is a genre of syncopated music very similar to [[dubstep]], the main difference being BPM, drum beat, and the general tone of the music.

Developments in [[social media]] and [[media literacy]] have changed how scholars begin to look at, and define engaged citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mihailidis|first=Paul|last2=Thevenin|first2=Benjamin|date=2013-11-01|title=Media Literacy as a Core Competency for Engaged Citizenship in Participatory Democracy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764213489015|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=57|issue=11|pages=1611–1622|doi=10.1177/0002764213489015|issn=0002-7642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engaged citizenship in politics can lead to an apparent consumption of the engaged person rather than offering people with an informed, active opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/article_feec5004-1300-11e7-b539-a7072c470f37.html|title=Guest column: When engaged citizens become consumed, politics disrupt lives, affect personal happiness|last=FAUCHEUX|first=RON|work=The Advocate|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media sites let people spread information, and create events to provide opportunities for engaged citizenship.&lt;ref name=thewire&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/118679/social-media-world-politics/|title=Can Social Media, Loud and Inclusive, Fix World Politics?|last=Fakhoury|first=Rania|website=thewire.in|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media and the internet provide a public access point to government affairs, and policies, away from townhall meetings, creating communities with similar concerns to recognize the pitfalls of governments and government policies.&lt;ref name=thewire /&gt;

The '''Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI)''' is an Indian organisation consisting of technicians from the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film industry]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. A total of 22 unions belonging to different trades in the film and television industry are affiliated to the FEFSI that has around 25,000 members.

==Strikes==
===June 1997===
In June 1997, some members of the FEFSI resorted to a flash strike during the shooting of the film ''[[Raman Abdullah]]'', directed by [[Balu Mahendra]], protesting against the director engaging "outsiders". This led into a major crisis when FEFSI launched an indefinite strike, affecting other film units as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/news/jul/07madras.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The state government's intervened and FEFSI called off the strike after a week. However, the producers hardened their stand and insisted that they would not engage any technician or worker associated with FEFSI. They complained that the rising wages of technical staff and artistes were contributing towards the box office run of Tamil films in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/entertai/jun/17mad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They demanded that workers and technicians form new organisations exclusively for the production of Tamil films, on the lines of organisations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The issue escalated when the organisation's leader [[Vijayan (stunt coordinator)|Vijayan]] declined to budge from his demands and was able failed to gather support from a series of prominent actors and film director [[Bharathiraja]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/News/97/Oct/strike.htm&lt;/ref&gt; vijayan also became the key person for the strike which led to suicide of some members and some lost their asserts due to this strike.

Films delayed included ''[[Marudhanayagam]]'', ''[[Jeans (film)|Jeans]]'', ''[[Sethu (film)|Sethu]]'' and ''[[Kadhal Rojave]]''. Producer [[K. T. Kunjumon]] said his losses amounted to {{INR}} 3 [[lakh]]s after a large set he had erected for his film ''[[Ratchagan]]'' (a replica of the massive Rajaji Hall) was destroyed in the rain. Several new Cielo cars parked near the set were also damaged, resulting in a loss of another {{INR}} 7 lakhs, he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.rediff.com/entertai/jun/30mad.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The strike lasted for over six months, delaying the production of several films before easing. In June 1998, FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Association (TFPA) merged and formed a new organisation called the Tamil Nadu Film Producers and Employees Federation. An agreement to this effect was signed by the representatives of the two organisations in the presence of then Chief Minister [[Muthuvel Karunanidhi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98jul06/nation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2011===
Talks between FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) over wages and working hours became a heated matter in early 2011 and FEFSI members wanted the issue regarding increase in salary to be sorted out immediately, calling for a strike in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/movies/fefsi-to-strike-from-monday-news-tamil-lgflWVajbbi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 2012===
An unofficial two-week strike was held in early February 2012, with nearly 5000 members of FEFSI engaging on a day-long hunger strike at Isai Kalaignargal Sangam in Vadapalani, demanding that the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) implement the revised wages for its members. The strike was made official briefly in April 2012 but did not disrupt any big-budget film productions, and soon the problems were eased out after the intervention of the State's Labour Minister [[S. T. Chellapandian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-10/clash-brings-kollywood-to-a-standstill-fefsi-strike-29-05-13.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moviecrow.com/News/824/fefsi-strike-fails-as-tamil-movies-carry-on&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sify.com/movies/fefsi-calls-off-strike-rumblings-in-tfpc-news-tamil-melj3Bebfgd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2013===
A clash broke out when the drivers' union learnt that one of the camera crews supposedly hired a private agency for their logistics, instead of approaching the assigned drivers and this was contrary to union expectations.&lt;ref&gt;http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-10/clash-brings-kollywood-to-a-standstill-fefsi-strike-29-05-13.html&lt;/ref&gt; After brief disturbances in May 2013, FEFSI announced a decision to boycott all vehicles of the drivers’ union. In June 2013, FEFSI announced that they would go an indefinite strike after it was alleged that members of the drivers union had assaulted members of the technicians union at Nerkundram Paadhai on Monday, when they were loading food into an autorickshaw for a film shoot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unions-clash-puts-film-shoots-on-hold/article4760404.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later the strike was cancelled and film shootings resumed.

As a fallout of the strike, the Tamil Nadu Chinna Thirai Producers Council president [[Raadhika]] announced that the council had decided to break away from FEFSI.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/film-technicians-union-calls-off-strike-shoots-to-resume/article4763699.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human Sexuality Collection''' (HSC) is a project at [[Cornell University Library]], part of Cornell's Rare and Manuscript Collections, which aims to collect "primary sources" on [[human sexuality]], with a special focus on "[[LGBT history in the United States|U.S. lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history]] and the  politics of [[pornography]]".

It was established in 1988 by [[David B. Goodstein]] (publisher of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'') and  [[Bruce Voeller]] (an early leader of the [[National Gay Task Force]]).

In 2011 it received a substantial collection of Harry Weintraub, collected since the early 1980s, which consists of more than 10,000 items related to [[male homosexuality]], dating back as far as the 1860s, now named the ''Harry H. Weintraub Collection of Gay-Related Photography and Historical Documentation''.

'''Josephine Dillon''' (January 26, 1884&lt;ref&gt;1900 U.S. Census: Long Beach, Los Angeles, California; Roll: T623 91; Page: 25A; Enumeration District: 109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Passport Application 1918, January 2, 1906-March 31, 1925; National Archives Microfilm Publication M1490, 2740 rolls; General Records of the Department of State, Record Group 59; National Archives, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; – November 11, 1971) was an American stage and film actress and acting teacher. She is best known as [[Clark Gable]]'s patron, acting coach and first wife.

==Early years and education==
Born in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], Dillon was one of six children of Judge Henry Clay Dillon. She was the younger sister of opera singer [[Enrica Clay Dillon]]. Dillon's father became a [[district attorney]] in [[Los Angeles]] while her mother was a prominent socialite. Dillon was educated in the [[California]] public school system and in Europe. She later studied acting at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="spicer41"&gt;{{harv|Spicer|2002|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduating from Stanford in 1908, Dillon studied acting in [[Italy]] for one year before returning to the United States to act on Broadway for actor [[Edward Everett Horton]]'s stock company in [[New York City]]. Dillon eventually decided to give up her career to teach acting. She relocated to [[Portland, Oregon]] where she opened "the Little Theatre", an acting school attended by wealthy area students.&lt;ref name="spicer41"/&gt;

It was at the Little Theatre that Dillon met a then unknown aspiring actor 17-years her junior named W. C. Gable, while she was working as a stage director for the Red Lantern Players.&lt;ref name="spicer41"/&gt; Initially, she was Gable's acting coach but the two began a romantic relationship after Dillon took a special interest in Gable. Dillon became his [[patron]], paying to have his teeth fixed and hair styled. She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture. She spent considerable time training his naturally high-pitched voice, which Gable slowly managed to lower, and to gain better resonance and tone. As his speech habits improved, Gable's facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After the long period of rigorous training, Dillon eventually considered him ready to attempt a film career in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Harris|2002|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillon moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 1924 where she opened The Dillon Stock Company. Five months later, Gable joined her.&lt;ref name="Spicer 2002 42"&gt;{{harv|Spicer|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were married shortly thereafter on December 18, 1924. On the marriage license, Gable claimed he was 24 years old while Dillon claimed she was 34.&lt;ref name="moffitt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19321020&amp;id=G7IWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2CEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4865,209781|title=The Climb of Clark Gable|last=Moffitt|first=John C.|date=October 20, 1932|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=1|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon continued to work with Gable on his acting and voice while he went to auditions. During this time, Gable followed Dillon's advice to use his middle name, "[[Clark Gable|Clark]]", as his professional name. Over the next few years, Clark Gable's career gained momentum with stage and minor film roles. After appearing in the play ''Machinal'' in 1929 and shortly before he was signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|M-G-M]], Gable asked Dillon for a divorce. Dillon later recalled that he had asked for a divorce several times before but she refused as she did not believe he meant it. She filed for legal separation on March 28, 1929. Their divorce became final on April 1, 1930. Two days later, Gable married wealthy socialite Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham, nicknamed "Rhea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19321024&amp;id=DqhQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2CEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3812,1071012|title=The Climb of Clark Gable|last=Moffitt|first=John C.|date=October 24, 1932|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=1|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
In 1940, Dillon began teaching acting at [[Columbia College (Missouri)|Christian College]] (now known as Columbia College) in [[Columbia, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19400115&amp;id=YBMsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CLoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2561,435088|title=A Candid Talk With Clark Gable's Coach|date=January 15, 1940|work=Times Daily|page=4|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she wrote ''Modern Acting''. The book describes in detail the training that she put Gable through over a six and a half year period. Upon returning to California, Dillon continued teaching acting. Her students included [[Bruce Cabot]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Donna Reed]], [[Rita Hayworth]] and [[Linda Darnell]].&lt;ref name="palmbeach"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&amp;dat=19570821&amp;id=JAgjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=380FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=942,4036029|title=First Wife of Clark Gable Denies 'King' Had Tattled|date=August 21, 1957|work=The Palm Beach Post|page=24|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, she made her only two film appearances in bit roles in ''[[The Lady and the Monster]]'' and ''[[Men on Her Mind]]''.

In the years following their divorce, Clark Gable became one of the most popular leading men of the era and would win an [[Academy Award]] in 1934. He also went on to marry four more times. Gable rarely spoke publicly about his marriage to Dillon. In a statement issued by M-G-M in 1932, Gable denied rumors that he had married Dillon solely to further his career. He claimed he was motivated only by love and added that he "owed [Dillon] a debt of gratitude" for guiding his early career.&lt;ref name="moffitt"/&gt; Dillon, who never remarried, refused to speak disparagingly about her famous ex-husband. She would only say the two were married "in name only", implying the marriage was not [[Consummation|consummated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Spicer|2002|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon's cousin later said that Dillon "carried a torch up to her dying day for [Gable]. That was her one and only real love."&lt;ref name="Spicer 2002 42"/&gt;

Throughout the 1950s and early 60s, Dillon continued to teach acting and lived in a small home in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. In July 1956, ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine published a story claiming that Dillon was "down and out" and that Clark Gable refused to help her. Dillon denied the story was true and later testified against the editors of the magazine in a libel trial in August 1957.&lt;ref name="palmbeach"/&gt; After the trial, Dillon lost many of her acting students due to the publicity. She nearly lost her home and later revealed that Gable had sent her money to avoid foreclosure. After Gable's death in November 1960, the press reported that his will stipulated that the remainder of Dillon's mortgage be paid in full by his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19601118&amp;id=4T5SAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FnkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5667,3717770|title=His First Wife Learns He Paid For Her Home|date=November 18, 1960|work=St. Petersburg Times|pages=12–A|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
Dillon continued working as an acting teacher until poor health forced her to retire in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="sumter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1979&amp;dat=19711113&amp;id=i44iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W6oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4434,1678383|title=First Gable Wife Dies|date=November 12, 1971|work=The Sumter Daily Item|page=18|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years following Gable's death, several biographies of the actor were published that mentioned his marriage to Dillon. She later reported that she regularly received abusive and insulting letters and telephone calls from Gable fans despite the fact that she never publicly disparaged him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19611011&amp;id=ckYqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pk4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7125,4401770|title=First Mrs. Gable Turns Sensation-Seekers Away|last=Scott|first=Vernon|date=October 11, 1961|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=39|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 1971, she died after a "lengthy illness" at a sanatorium in [[Glendale, California]].&lt;ref name="sumter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19711112&amp;id=GUEjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=36EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4161,5437015|title=Clark Gable first wife dies at 87|date=November 12, 1971|work=The Montreal Gazette|page=41|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is interred at [[Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles|Calvary Cemetery]] in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ellenberger|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''lanterne rouge''' is the competitor in last place in a cycling race such as the [[Tour de France]].  The phrase comes from the French for "Red Lantern" and refers to the red lantern hung on the rear vehicle of a passenger [[railway]] train or the brake van of a freight train, which signalmen would look for in order to make sure none of the couplings had become disconnected.&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, Bill. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121691877739881571 "The Tour's Master of Last Place"]. The Wall Street Journal, 25 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural uses==
In the [[Tour de France]] the rider who finishes last, rather than dropping out along the way, is accorded the distinction of lanterne rouge. Because of the popularity it affords, riders may compete for the last position rather than settling for a place near the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicycling.com/fight-lanterne-rouge|title=Lanterne Rouge|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the rider who comes last is remembered while those a few places ahead are forgotten.  The revenue the last rider will generate from later appearance fees can be greater than if he had finished second to last, although this was more true when riders still made much of their income from post-Tour [[criterium]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesraia.com/lanterne-rouge-the-honor-being-last-the-tour-france/|title=Lanterne Rouge: The Honor Of Being Last In The Tour de France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1979 Tour de France]], [[Gerhard Schönbacher]] and [[Philippe Tesnière]] were on the last two spots in the general classification, less than one minute apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.elmundodeportivo.es/preview/1979/07/19/pagina-21/1049842/pdf.html|title=Tour: Clasificaciones Oficiales|date=19 July 1979|page=21|work=El Mundo Deportivo|language=Spanish|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesnière had already finished last in the [[1978 Tour de France|1978 Tour]], so he was aware of the publicity associated with being the lanterne rouge.
In the 21st stage, a time trial, Tesnière therefore rode slowly. The winner of the time trial, [[Bernard Hinault]], took 1 hour, 8 minutes and 53 seconds to cover the 48.8&amp;nbsp;km, Schönbacher used 1 hour, 21 minutes and 52 seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1978_2005/tdf1979_21.php|title=66ème Tour de France - 21ème étape|accessdate=24 May 2011|language=French|work=Memoire du Cyclisme}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Tesniere rode it in 1 hour, 23 minutes and 32 seconds; both were slower than all other cyclists.&lt;ref name="ld"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/index.php?page=1&amp;mod=krantresultaat&amp;q=schonbacher&amp;datering=&amp;krant=&amp;qt=paragraaf&amp;pagina=&amp;sort=datum+asc%2Ckrant+asc%2Cpagina+asc&amp;paragraaf=33&amp;doc=7&amp;p=9&amp;paragraaf=33|title=Kostbare vergissing Tesnière|page=9|date=20 July 1979|work=Leidsch Dagblad|publisher=Regionaal Archief Leiden|language=Dutch|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesnière's time was more than 20% slower than Hinault's, which meant that he had missed the time cut, and was taken out of the race.&lt;ref name="ld"/&gt;

The Tour organisation did not like the attention that the lanterne rouge received, and for the [[1980 Tour de France|1980 Tour]] devised a rule to make it more difficult to finish last: between the 14th and the 20th stage, the rider last in the general classification was removed from the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1978_2005/tdf1980.php |title=67ème Tour de France |accessdate=24 May 2011 |language=French |work=Memoire du Cyclisme |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120195146/http://www.memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1978_2005/tdf1980.php |archivedate=20 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Schönbacher managed to finish last in that race. Before the Tour, Schönbacher was promised by his sponsor that he would receive extra money if he finished in last place. After the last stage of the Tour, his team leader [[Patrick Lefevre]] told Schönbacher that he would not get the money, and after a heated discussion, Schönbacher was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/index.php?page=0&amp;mod=krantresultaat&amp;q=%22weer+laatste%22&amp;datering=7-1980&amp;krant=&amp;qt=paragraaf&amp;pagina=&amp;sort=score+desc|title=Schönbacher weer laatste|date=21 July 1980|accessdate=24 May 2011|page=10|work=Leidsche Courant|publisher=Regionaal Archief Leiden|language=Dutch|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819232142/http://leiden.courant.nu/index.php?page=0&amp;mod=krantresultaat&amp;q=%22weer+laatste%22&amp;datering=7-1980&amp;krant=&amp;qt=paragraaf&amp;pagina=&amp;sort=score+desc|archivedate=19 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of catchphrases''' found in British and American television and film, where a [[catchphrase]] is a short phrase or expression that has gained usage beyond its initial scope. These are not merely catchy sayings. Even though some sources may identify a phrase as a catchphrase, this list is for those that meet the definition given in the lead section of the catchphrase article and are [[wp:notability|notable]] for their widespread use within the culture.

This list is distinct from the [[list of political catchphrases]].

== In British culture ==
&lt;!-- READ THIS FIRST: Please see the discussion at [[Talk:List of catchphrases]] regarding the consensus for whether to include your favourite catchphrase in this list.
This list is for phrases that meet the definition and notability guidelines of a catchphrase. The standard for inclusion is that it be internally linked to articles or article sections. This list is not a dumping ground for favourite quotes, slogans, catchwords, idioms, neologisms, etc.

'''Liudmila Grigorievna Kovnatskaya''' (born 5 February 1941) is a Russian musicologist. She is a professor at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St Petersburg State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov]] (1987), and the Chief Researcher at the Russian Institute of Fine Arts History in St Petersburg. She is considered an Honoured Art Worker of Russian Federation.

==Education==
She graduated in 1965 from two departments at the Leningrad State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov: the department of History of Music and Piano Performing Faculty, and the department of Organ Playing, having studied under Prof Isai Braudo. It was at the Conservatoire that she finished a postgraduate course in the department of History of Western Music, under the supervision of Prof Dr Mikhail Druskin. In 1970 Liudmila Kovnatskaya presented a candidate dissertation on Benjamin Britten’s oeuvre. In 1987 she completed a doctoral dissertation on English music of 20th century, at the Moscow research institute of Arts of Academy of Science, USSR.

==Professional experience==
Since 1987 Prof Kovnatskaya is a member of [[Union of Soviet Composers|Russian Composers’ Union]], and she was a member of the General Council for Cultural Affairs of St Petersburg from 1987 until 1993. In 2002 she became a member of the Council (Directorium) of the IMS. In the same year, she became a member of the editorial board of the journal “Tempo” (Cambridge).

In 2001 Prof Kovnatskaya became a materials consultant on Russian music for "The Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians" (London: McMillan, 2001). She was also a guest lecturer at the University of Manchester (1991), the Aldeburgh Festival (UK), and the Ural Conservatoire in Yekaterinburg.

Liudmila Kovnatskaya is the author of a monograph about [[Benjamin Britten]] (Moscow, 1974), in the book “English Music in the 20th Century: Sources and periods of development” (Moscow, 1986). Thanks to her research and organization activity in Russia, various festivals and concerts were organized, which were dedicated to English classic music, including Britten. Among them were “Ars Britannica” (1988–1990), the festival in honour of “The 80th anniversary of B. Britten” (1993), “The World of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]” (1996), the festival of Britten’s music on his 85th anniversary (1998), the jubilee concert in honour of Britten and [[Saint Cecilia]], patron saint of musicians (2003), the concert “World of Opera: Benjamin Britten”, and others.

Prof Kovnatskaya’s research fields include [[Music of Russia|History of Russian Music]]; she has written, edited and compiled books and articles on [[Dmitri Shostakovich|D. Shostakovich]]. Among her non-published manuscripts one can find a monumental work entitled “Ideological control of Musical avant-garde of 1920s: Leningrad Association of Contemporary Music in reports and other materials” (Soros Foundation Funding).

Shostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten, Purcell, Tippet, Arensky, Balakirev, English music, Russian-English connections, M. S. Druskin, A. Schweitzer and the Soviet musical epoch – all these subjects were established by Prof Kovnatskaya due to her intensive and rigorous nature as a researcher, editor and author of books, proceedings, collections and many-volume editions.

A separate field of her research and publishing activity is the ‘offering to the Teacher’, who was a famous musicologist and Professor of Leningrad Conservatoire Mikhail Druskin. In 2009, thanks to Prof Kovnatskaya, a two-volume collection was published, entitled “Memory to Mikhail Semenovich Druskin”, which united articles, recollections, biographical materials and correspondence. All who knew M. Druskin as a musician, musicologist and teacher took part in the creation of this 1000 page book. Furthermore, in addition to this, Liudmila Kovnatskaya led the task of re-publishing works by Druskin and, as a result, realized an extensive project: a 7-volume Collected Works. At present, the first volume, “Clavir music”, and the fourth volume, “Igor Stravinsky”, are published.

'''Luigi Riccoboni''' (1 April 1676 – 6 December 1753)&lt;ref name=BnF&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb11998321f/PUBLIC "Riccoboni, Luigi" Notice d'autorité personne] at the [[BnF]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; was an Italian actor and writer on theatre, who was director of the [[Comédie-Italienne]] in Paris from 1716 to 1731. In France he was known as '''Louis Riccoboni''' and his stage name was '''Lélio'''.&lt;ref name=Forman&gt;Forman 2010, pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Born Luigi Andrea Riccoboni&lt;ref&gt;[http://isni-url.oclc.nl/isni/0000000115857945 ISNI]; Senelick 1995b gives his middle name as Andreas.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Modena]],&lt;ref name=BnF/&gt; he was the son of Antonio Riccoboni, who played [[Pantalone]] in London in 1678–1679.&lt;ref&gt;Senelick 1995b; Hartnoll 1983, p. 693.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1699 Luigi Riccoboni established a ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' troupe in the French style in northern Italy, since in his view the Italian tradition had become overly decadent.&lt;ref name=Senelick&gt;Senelick 1995b.&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated some of the plays of [[Molière]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]] into Italian.&lt;ref name=Forman/&gt;

== Paris ==
In the spring of 1716 the French [[Regent]], [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans]], asked his cousin, the [[Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]], to send him a troupe of Italian actors to revive the [[Comédie-Italienne]] in Paris, which had been disbanded nearly twenty years previous. To avoid some of the difficulties of the earlier troupe, he specified that its leader should be a man of good character and manners. Riccoboni was chosen, and in a few weeks he assembled a group of ten actors, all of whom were devout Christians. The troupe was meant to perform in the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]], which had been vacant since 1697, but that theatre needed renovation, so they initially played at the [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|Théâtre du Palais-Royal]] on days when the [[Paris Opera|Opéra]] was not performing. Even after moving to the Bourgogne, the troupe continued to perform at the Palais-Royal on Mondays and Saturdays until the death of the Regent in 1723.&lt;ref&gt;Brenner 1961, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a director, Riccoboni initially had difficulty retaining audiences with improvised plays in Italian. More and more he turned to written texts and a style of presentation that was tailored to local tastes, along with an ever increasing use of the French language.&lt;ref name=Hartnoll&gt;Hartnoll 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1718 he successfully revived some of the old plays of [[Évariste Gherardi]], the director of the Comédie-Italienne in the years prior to 1697.&lt;ref&gt;Brenner 1961, p. 4; Senelick 1995a.&lt;/ref&gt; He himself wrote several plays, including ''L'Italien à Paris'' and ''L'Italien francisé'' in which Italian and French manners were juxtaposed. He also began to produce plays by French playwrights, such as [[Pierre Rémond de Sainte-Albine]], whose scenario ''L'Amante difficile'' was performed in Italian. The first play entirely in French was ''Le Naufrage au Port à l'Anglais'' by [[Jacques Autreau]]. Riccoboni achieved his greatest acclaim for his expressive acting, particularly in the plays of [[Marivaux]].&lt;ref name=Senelick/&gt;

==Other aspects of his career==
Riccoboni appeared in London in 1728–1729.&lt;ref name=Senelick/&gt; He wrote several books on theatre in Italian and French. One was translated into English in 1741.

==Personal life==
Riccoboni married twice, first to actress Gabriella Gardellini (stage name [[Argentina (actress)|Argentina]]), and second to Elena Balletti (1686–1771; stage name Flaminia). His son [[Antoine-François Riccoboni]] (1707–1772) was an actor who used the stage name Lélio ''fils'' and in 1734 married [[Marie-Jeanne de La Boras]].&lt;ref name=Senelick/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartnoll/&gt;

[[File:2017-12-27 Marc-Uwe Kling 7944 cropped.jpg|thumb|Marc-Uwe Kling (2017)]]
'''Marc-Uwe Kling''' (born 1982 in [[Stuttgart]]) is a German songwriter, author and ''[[Kabarett]]'' (political stand-up comedy) artist. He studied Philosophy and Dramatics at [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. His grandmother is called 'Helene'.

Since 2003, Kling regularly performs on various stages in [[Berlin]]. Frequently, he performs at literary and ''Kabarett'' events as well as poetry slams. In 2004 he founded a serial public literary event called ''Lesedüne'' (a pun made of the German words ''Lesebühne'', "lecture stage", and ''Düne'', "dune"). Since 2005 Kling tours with his program ''Wenn alle Stricke reißen, kann man sich nicht mal mehr aufhängen'' (literally, "If all ropes snap, you can't even hang yourself anymore"), which is also the title of his first CD. Every first Tuesday of the month he organizes and hosts the ''[[Kreuzberg]] Slam'' in the ''Lido'' (formerly ''Kato'') location, and every first Wednesday the ''Poetry Slam of Studentisches Kulturzentrum'' in [[Potsdam]].

Currently, he authors a weekly podcast ''Neues vom Känguru'' (roughly: "News from the Kangaroo"), for [[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg#Radio|Fritz]], a Potsdam-based radio-station, which deals with the same theme as his book ''Die Känguru-Chroniken'' ("The Kangaroo Chronicles"): A "phlegmatic anarchist" himself, he lives with a talking, "pragmatically [[communism|communist]]" kangaroo as his room mate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12552">'''Minsky's Burlesque''' refers to the brand of [[American burlesque]] presented by four sons of Louis and Ethel Minsky: '''Abraham 'Abe' Bennett Minsky''' (1880–1949), '''Michael William 'Billy' Minsky''' (1887–1932), '''Herbert Kay Minsky''' (1891-1959), and [[Morton Minsky]] (1902–1987).&lt;ref name=morton&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Morton Minsky Is Dead |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DF123FF937A15750C0A961948260|quote=Morton Minsky, the last of four brothers who made burlesque a New York institution, died yesterday of cancer at his home in Manhattan.

Steuer he put up the Winter Garden Building. It housed two theatres, one on the sixth floor, one on the first. Brother Billy, 45, started showing films in the upper auditorium in 1912. Brother Abe, 54, had been running a nickelodeon theatre of his own and drifted in to help. When Brother Herbert, 40, acquired his law degree from Columbia and Brother Morton, 30, was graduated from New York University, they helped out, too.  |work=[[Time magazine]] |date=May 2, 1932 |accessdate=2009-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They started in 1912 and ended in 1937 in [[New York City]]. Although the shows were declared obscene and outlawed, they were rather tame by modern standards.

==History==
The eldest brother, Abe, launched the business in 1908 with a [[Lower East Side]] [[Nickelodeon movie theater|nickelodeon]] showing racy films. His own father shut him down and bought the National Winter Garden on Houston Street, which had a theater inconveniently located on the sixth floor. He gave the theater to Abe and his brothers Billy and Herbert. At first they tried showing respectable films but could not compete with the large theater chains. The Minskys tried to bolster their shows by bringing in vaudeville performers but could not afford good acts.

Then they considered [[American burlesque|burlesque]]. Burlesque acts were cheaper, and circuits (called "wheels") supplied a new show every week, complete with cast, costumes, and scenery. There was the [[Columbia Wheel]], the American Wheel, and the Mutual Wheel. Burlesque during this period was "clean"; a fourth wheel, the Independent, actually went bankrupt in 1916 after refusing to clean up its act. The Minskys briefly considered signing with a wheel but decided to stage their own shows because it was cheaper and Billy longed to be the next [[Florenz Ziegfeld]].

But Minsky's clientele of poor immigrants had not been taught to appreciate clean burlesque, and the Minskys were not about to teach them. Plus, their audience needed a compelling reason to trek up to a sixth-floor theater. Billy realized that success in burlesque depended on how the women were featured. Abe, who had been to Paris and the [[Folies Bergère]] and [[Moulin Rouge]], suggested importing one of their trademarks: a runway to bring the women out into the audience. The theater was reconfigured, and the Minskys were the first to feature a runway in the United States. Billy had the sign out front changed to "Burlesque As You Like It – Not a Family Show," and the Minskys were on their way.

The Minskys were raided for the first time in 1917 when Mae Dix absent-mindedly began removing her costume before she reached the wings. When the crowd cheered, Dix returned to the stage to continue removing her clothing to wild applause. Billy ordered the "accident" repeated every night. This began an endless cycle: to keep their license, the Minskys had to keep their shows clean, but to keep drawing customers they had to be risqué. Whenever they went too far, they were raided.

Morton joined the company in 1924, after graduating from [[New York University]], and worked at the Little Apollo Theater on 125th Street. There was a raid during the very first show. For the next four years, the theater showed a weekly profit of $20,000 after [[payola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=4 Brothers |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7DB153FF933A05750C0A960948260|first=Gerald |last=Goldberg|work=[[New York Times]]|quote=Morton - the youngest of the four Minsky brothers - joined the family firm in 1924, fresh out of New York University, and became the resident Minsky at their newly acquired Little Apollo Theater on 125th Street. For the next four years, the theater showed a weekly profit of $20,000 after payola. |date=March 30, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billy's attempt, however, to present classy burlesque at the Park Theater on Columbus Circle failed miserably.

Another famous raid occurred in April, 1925, and inspired the book and film ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]''. By this time it was permissible for women in shows staged by Ziegfeld, [[George White's Scandals|George White]], and [[Earl Carroll]] – as well as burlesque – to appear topless as long as they did not move (a similar rule in London burlesque was famously demonstrated in the film [[Mrs. Henderson Presents]]). In a show at the National Winter Garden, Mademoiselle Fifi (née Mary Dawson from Pennsylvania) stripped to the waist and then moved.  Occasionally a raid was triggered by the comedy material, but filthy comics did not last long, because they were a liability to the management.

Business boomed during [[Prohibition]] and the National Winter Garden's notoriety grew. Regular patrons included [[John Dos Passos]], [[Robert Benchley]], [[George Jean Nathan]], [[Condé Montrose Nast|Condé Nast]], and [[Hart Crane]] (see Crane's poem "National Winter Garden" in [[The Bridge (long poem)|''The Bridge)'']].

Billy realized that while burlesque could not be classy it could be presented in classy surroundings. In 1931 he proposed bringing the Minsky brand to Broadway, amid the respectable shows. The brothers leased the Republic Theater on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and staged their first show on February 12. The Republic became Minsky's flagship theater and the capital of burlesque in the United States. (The theater is now called the [[New Victory Theater|New Victory]] and, ironically, specializes in children's entertainment.) Other burlesque shows were inspired to open on 42nd Street at the nearby Eltinge and Apollo Theaters.

[[The Great Depression]] ushered in the greatest era for burlesque, and Minsky burlesque in particular. Few could afford to attend expensive Broadway shows, yet people craved entertainment. Furthermore, there now seemed to be an unlimited supply of unemployed pretty women who considered the steady work offered by burlesque. By the time they finished expanding, the various Minskys controlled over a dozen theaters – six in New York and others in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Albany, and Pittsburgh. They even formed their own "wheel."

Minsky's featured comics [[Phil Silvers]], [[Joey Faye]],&lt;ref&gt;He was "House Comic" from 1931 to 1939,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rags Ragland]], [[Zero Mostel]], [[Jules Munshin]], [[Jimmy Savo]], [[Eddie Collins]], [[Pinky Lee]], [[Morey Amsterdam]], [[Red Buttons]], [[Benny Rubin]], [[Irving Benson]], [[Red Skelton]], and [[Abbott and Costello]], as well as headlining [[stripper]] [[Gypsy Rose Lee]].&lt;ref name=morton/&gt; Others included [[Danny Kaye]], [[Jack Albertson]] and [[Robert Alda]], as well as [[stripper]]s [[Lili St. Cyr]], [[Georgia Sothern]], [[Ann Corio]], [[Margie Hart]], [[Mara Gaye]] and [[Sherry Britton]]. These women, who began stripping in their teens, made between $700 and $2,000 a week.

With burlesque thriving in New York (there were now 14 burlesque theaters, including Minsky's rivals), competition was fierce. Each year, various license commissioners issued restrictions to keep burlesque from pushing the limits. But convictions were rare, so theater managers saw no need to tone down their shows.The Minskys emphasized that a good strip-tease dance must know exactly the right psychological moment to remove each garment. 'It is not just a matter of going on the stage and taking off clothes - it needs finesse.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Zemeckis, Leslie (2013). [www.behindtheburlyq.com Behind The Burly Q] Check |url= scheme (help). Delaware: Skyhorse. {{ISBN|978-1-62087-691-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, irate citizens' groups began calling for action against burlesque. [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia]] deemed them a "corrupting moral influence." &lt;ref name=morton/&gt; The city's license commissioner, Paul Moss, tried to revoke Minsky's license but the State Court of Appeals ruled that he did not have grounds without a criminal conviction. Finally, in April, 1937, a stripper at Abe Minsky's New Gotham Theater in Harlem was spotted working without a [[G-string]]. The ensuing raid led to the demise not only of Minsky burlesque but of all burlesque in New York. The conviction allowed Moss to revoke Abe's license and refuse to renew all of the other burlesque licenses in New York.

After several appeals, the Minskys and their rivals were allowed to reopen only if they adhered to new rules that forbade strippers. The owners went along, hoping to stay in business until the November election when reformist mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] might be voted out. But business under the new code was so bad that many New York burlesque theaters closed their doors for good. By the time La Guardia was re-elected, the word "burlesque" had been banned and, soon after, the Minsky name itself, since the two were synonymous. With that final blow, burlesque and the Minskys were finished in New York.

=== Harold Minsky ===
Of all the Minskys, only '''Harold,''' Abe's adopted&lt;ref name="Goodwin"&gt;Goodwin, Joanne. [https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003956/http://onlinenevada.org/Minsky_s_Burlesque "Minsky's Burlesque,"] Online Nevada Encyclopedia. Accessed Aug. 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; son, remained active in burlesque. Harold started at age nineteen at the height of the [[Great Depression]], learning the business by working in all facets from the [[box office]] to theater management. "At nineteen, Harold took over the business from his father. Every summer, his parents went to Europe for vacation and the theatres would close due to the heat in [[New York City]]. Theatres
weren’t air-conditioned. The performers begged Harold to keep his doors open; the girls were broke, and they desperately needed the money from the performances. So Harold stayed open and, though a ticket cost a dime, 'He made over
a million dollars,' claimed his wife Dardy Minsky.” &lt;ref name=Zemeckis&gt;{{cite book|last=Zemeckis|first=Leslie|title=Behind the Burly Q|date=2013|publisher=Skyhorse|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-62087-691-6|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By his early twenties, Harold had already produced shows. Harold was the first one to do nudity in a nice way.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Harold would become responsible for discovering and grooming dozens of the most famous names throughout the 1930s into the '50s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Harold claimed to have targeted future headliner fourteen-year-old [[Sherry Britton]] from an audition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Harold also employed and nurtured first-rate comic talents such as [[Phil Silvers]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt; Zemeckis, Leslie (2013). [www.behindtheburlyq.com Behind The Burly Q] Check |url= scheme (help). Delaware: Skyhorse. {{ISBN|978-1-62087-691-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Harold brought the Minsky name to a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] revue at the [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]],&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt; where it could exist without apology. Harold, Dardy and their two children moved there while he put on a show at the Dunes.  He kept a [[chorus line]], top-rate comedians, a snazzy band, and, of course, the star strippers.  He did smashing business; for the first time making burlesque accessible to an upper-middle-class crowd.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; That [[revue]] ran for six years; subsequently, he moved Minsky productions into other landmark casinos such as the [[Silver Slipper]], the Thunderbird, and [[The Aladdin]]. 

Harold resided in Las Vegas until his death in 1977.&lt;ref name="Goodwin" /&gt;

'''''Mommy 2: Mommy's Day''''' (also known as just '''''Mommy's Day''''') is a 1997 [[low budget]] sequel to the 1995 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Mommy (1995 film)|Mommy]]'' starring [[Patty McCormack]] once again as the psychotically obsessed mother who is trying to reunite with her daughter.

==Plot==
Mrs. Sterling ([[Patty McCormack]]), who had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death, escapes execution when she is wounded in a prison breakout attempt. While she is recovering, a physician convinces the courts that she would be able to live in a halfway house if she takes a violence-suppressing drug that he designed. Although her parole forbids contact with her daughter (who is now living with her sister and brother-in-law), she violates her parole by secretly visiting her one night. When people who are trying to keep her from seeing her daughter start turning up murdered, a local cop starts investigating her.

'''''Octavia''''' is a [[Latin literature|Roman]] [[tragedy]] that focuses on three days in the year 62 AD during which [[Nero]] divorced and exiled his wife [[Claudia Octavia]] and married another ([[Poppaea Sabina]]). The play also deals with the irascibility of Nero and his inability to take heed of the philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca's]] advice to rein in his [[passion (emotion)|passions]].

The play was attributed to Seneca, but modern scholarship generally discredits this.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It is presumed to have been written later in the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] period during the 1st century, after the deaths of both Nero and Seneca.

==Characters==
*[[Claudia Octavia|Octavia]].
*Octavia's Nurse. 
*Chorus of Romans. 
*[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. 
*Prefect. 
*[[Poppaea Sabina|Poppaea]]. 
*[[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]] (ghost). 
*[[Nero]]. 
*Messenger. 

==Plot==
===Act I===
Octavia, weary of her existence, bewails her misery. Her nurse curses the drawbacks which beset life in a Palace. The Nurse consoles Octavia and dissuades her from executing any revenge which she might be contemplating. The Chorus being in favor of Octavia, looks with detestation upon the marriage of Poppaea, and condemns the degenerate patience of the Romans, as being unworthy, too indifferent and servile, and complains about the crimes of Nero.&lt;ref name="bradshaw"&gt;{{Cite book|
last=Bradshaw|first=Watson|title=The ten tragedies of Seneca|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924104730209|year=1903|publisher=S. Sonnenschein &amp; Co.}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Act II===
Seneca deplores the vices of his times, praises the simplicity of his former life, and offers his opinion that all things are tending to the worse. The philosopher warns his patron Nero but to no purpose. Nero stubbornly insists on carrying out his tyrannical plans, and appoints the next day for his marriage with Poppaea.&lt;ref name="bradshaw"/&gt; 

===Act III===
Agrippina appears from the underworld as a cruel soothsayer. She brings torches from the underworld to grace the wedding, and predicts the death of Nero. Octavia urges the populace, who are espousing her cause, not to grieve about her divorce. The Chorus however, does grieve for her sad lot.&lt;ref name="bradshaw"/&gt;

===Act IV===
Poppaea, being frightened in her sleep, narrates her dream to the Nurse. The Nurse treating the dream as nonsense, consoles Poppaea with a shallow interpretation. The Chorus praises the beauty of Poppaea. The Messenger describes the hostile mood of the populace concerning Octavia's divorce and Nero's marriage with Poppaea.&lt;ref name="bradshaw"/&gt;

===Act V===
Nero, boiling over with rage on account of the tumultuous rising of the populace, orders the most severe measures to be taken against them, and that Octavia, as the cause of the rising, shall be transported to [[Pandataria]] and there slain. The Chorus sings regarding popular favor, which has been destructive to so many, and after that tells of the hard fates which have befallen the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].&lt;ref name="bradshaw"/&gt;

In [[economics]], [[game theory]], [[decision theory]], and [[artificial intelligence]], a '''rational agent''' is an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] that has clear [[preferences]], models [[uncertainty]] via [[expected values]] of variables or functions of variables, and always chooses to perform the action with the [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] expected outcome for itself from among all feasible actions. A rational agent can be anything that makes decisions, typically a person, firm, machine, or software.

Rational agents are also studied in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[ethics]], and philosophy, including the philosophy of [[practical reason]].

==Economics==
In reference to economics, rational agent refers to hypothetical consumers and how they make decisions in a [[free market]]. This concept is one of the assumptions made in [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]]. The concept of economic [[rationality]] arises from a tradition of [[marginal analysis]] used in neoclassical economics. The idea of a rational agent is important to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], as detailed by philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s theory of the [[felicific calculus]], also known as the hedonistic calculus.

The action a rational agent takes depends on:
* the preferences of the agent
* the agent's information of its environment, which may come from past experiences
* the actions, duties and obligations available to the agent
* the estimated or actual benefits and the chances of success of the actions.

In [[game theory]] and classical [[economics]], it is often assumed that the [[actor]]s, people, and firms are rational.  However, the extent to which people and firms behave rationally is subject to debate.  Economists often assume the models of [[rational choice theory]] and [[bounded rationality]] to formalize and predict the behavior of individuals and firms.  Rational agents sometimes behave in manners that are counter-intuitive to many people, as in the [[traveler's dilemma]].

=== Criticisms === 
Many economic theories reject [[utilitarianism]] and rational agency, especially those that might be considered [[heterodox]].

For example, [[Thorstein Veblen]], known as the father of [[institutional economics]], rejects the notion of hedonistic calculus and pure rationality saying: "The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact."

Veblen instead perceives human economic decisions as the result of multiple complex cumulative factors: "It is the characteristic of man to do something, not simply to suffer pleasures and pains through the impact of suitable forces. He is ... a coherent structure of propensities and habits which seeks realization and expression in an unfolding activity. ... They are the products of his hereditary traits and his past experience, cumulatively wrought out under a given body of traditions conventionalities, and material circumstances; and they afford the point of departure for the next step in the process. The economic life history of the individual is a cumulative process of adaptation of means to ends that cumulatively change as the process goes on, both the agent and his environment being at any point the outcome of the last process."
[[Evolutionary economics]] also provides criticisms of the Rational Agent, citing the "parental bent" (the idea that biological impulses can and do frequently override rational decision making based on utility). Arguments against rational agency have also cited the enormous influence of [[marketing]] as proof that humans can be persuaded to make economic decisions that are "non-rational" in nature.

=== Alternate theories ===
[[Neuroeconomics]] is a concept that uses [[neuroscience]], social [[psychology]] and other fields of science to better understand how people make decisions.  Unlike rational agent theory, [[neuroeconomics]] does not attempt to predict large-scale human behavior but rather how individuals make decisions in case-by-case scenarios.

==Artificial intelligence==
[[Artificial intelligence]] has borrowed the term "rational agents" from economics to describe autonomous programs that are capable of goal directed behavior.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} Today there is a considerable overlap between AI research, game theory and decision theory. Rational agents in AI are closely related to ''[[intelligent agent]]s'', autonomous software programs that display intelligence.

'''Roscoe Conkling''' "'''Fatty'''" '''Arbuckle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|b|ʌ|k|əl}}; March 24, 1887 – June 29, 1933) was an American [[silent film]] actor, comedian, director, and screenwriter. Starting at the [[Selig Polyscope Company]] he eventually moved to [[Keystone Studios]], where he worked with [[Mabel Normand]] and [[Harold Lloyd]]. He mentored [[Charlie Chaplin]] and discovered [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Bob Hope]]. Arbuckle was one of the most popular silent stars of the 1910s, and soon became one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood, signing a contract in 1920 with [[Paramount Pictures]] for US$1&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1921|r=-6}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).

Between November 1921 and April 1922, Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials for the [[rape]] and [[manslaughter]] of young film actress [[Virginia Rappe]]. Rappe had suddenly fallen ill at a party hosted by Arbuckle at the [[St. Francis Hotel]] in San Francisco on September 5, 1921; she died four days later. Arbuckle was accused by Rappe's dubious acquaintance of raping and accidentally killing Rappe. After the first two trials, which resulted in [[hung jury|hung juries]], Arbuckle was acquitted in the third trial and received a formal written statement of apology from the jury.

Despite Arbuckle's acquittal, the scandal ruined his career and even today, has mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian. Following the trials, his films were banned and he was publicly ostracized. Although the ban on his films was lifted within a year, Arbuckle only worked sparingly through the 1920s. He later worked as a film director under the pseudonym '''William Goodrich'''. He was finally able to return to acting in 1932, making short two-reel comedies for [[Warner Bros.]]

Arbuckle died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1933 at the age of 46, reportedly on the same day he signed a contract with Warner Bros. to make a feature film.&lt;ref name="trutv1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Denise |last=Noe |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/fatty_arbuckle/2.html |title=Fatty Arbuckle and the Death of Virginia Rappe |publisher=[[Crime Library]] at [[truTV]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917054657/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/fatty_arbuckle/2.html |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=July 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Roscoe Conkling Arbuckle was born on March 24, 1887, in [[Smith Center, Kansas]], one of nine children of Mary E. "Mollie" Gordon (d. February 19, 1898) and William Goodrich Arbuckle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Year: 1900; Census Place: Santa Clara, Santa Clara, California; Roll: 111; Page: 7A; Enumeration District: 0077; FHL microfilm: 1240111|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=1900usfedcen&amp;indiv=try&amp;h=19179017|website=Ancestry.com|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He weighed in excess of {{convert|13|lb|kg|abbr=on}} at birth and, as both parents had slim builds, his father believed the child was not his. Consequently, he named the baby after a politician (and notorious philanderer) whom he despised, Republican senator [[Roscoe Conkling]] of New York. The birth was traumatic for Mollie and resulted in chronic health problems that contributed to her death 12 years later.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Chris &amp; Julie |title=The Mammoth Book of Celebrity Murder: Murder played out in the spotlight of maximum publicity |publisher=Constable &amp; Robertson |date=April 10, 2005 |isbn=978-0786715688 |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Mammoth-Book-Celebrity-Murder/dp/0786715685#reader_0786715685 |subscription=yes |accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Arbuckle was nearly two his family moved to [[Santa Ana, California]].&lt;ref name="renamed_from_100_on_20130906192147"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDEOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |last=Lowrey |first=Carolyn |title=The First One Hundred Noted Men and Women of the Screen |year=1920 |page=6 |publisher=Moffat, Yard &amp; Co. |location=New York |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roscoe had a "wonderful" singing voice and was extremely agile. At the age of eight, with his mother's encouragement, he first performed on stage with [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon's company]] during their stopover in Santa Ana.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_100_on_20130906192147"/&gt; Arbuckle enjoyed performing and continued on until his mother's death in 1899 when he was 12. His father, who had always treated him harshly,&lt;ref name=JollyWeak&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lBIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YeQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3436,3461777&amp;dq=virginia+rappe&amp;hl=en |title=Roscoe Always Jolly But Weak: Stepmother |date=September 12, 1921 |publisher=The Evening News |location=San Jose |pages=1–2 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; now refused to support him and Arbuckle got work doing odd jobs in a hotel. Arbuckle was in the habit of singing while he worked and was overheard by a customer who was a professional singer. The customer invited him to perform in an amateur talent show. The show consisted of the audience judging acts by clapping or jeering with bad acts pulled off the stage by a [[shepherd's crook]]. Arbuckle sang, danced, and did some clowning around, but did not impress the audience. He saw the crook emerge from the wings and to avoid it somersaulted into the [[orchestra pit]] in obvious panic. The audience went wild, and he not only won the competition but began a career in [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Mabel Normand 009.JPG|thumb|Frequent co-star [[Mabel Normand]].]]
In 1904, [[Sid Grauman]] invited Arbuckle to sing in his new Unique Theater in San Francisco, beginning a long friendship between the two.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfcityguides.org/public_guidelines.html?article=200&amp;submitted=TRUE&amp;srch_text=&amp;submitted2=&amp;topic=Movies |title=Grauman's Theaters |last=Saperstein |first=Susan |publisher=San Jose, California Guides |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HBhKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PiENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=744,1086129&amp;dq=grauman&amp;hl=en |title=She Must Use 7 Mirrors |date=January 31, 1905 |work=The Evening News |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined the [[Alexander Pantages|Pantages Theatre Group]] touring the [[West Coast of the United States]] and in 1906 played the Orpheum Theater in [[Portland, Oregon]], in a vaudeville troupe organized by [[Leon Errol]]. Arbuckle became the main act and the group took their show on tour.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dies in His Sleep.

On August 6, 1908, Arbuckle married [[Minta Durfee]] (1889–1975), the daughter of Charles Warren Durfee and Flora Adkins. Durfee starred in many early comedy films, often with Arbuckle.&lt;ref name=Durfee&gt;{{cite news |title=Minta Durfee, actress, 85, Dies; Former Wife of Fatty Arbuckle |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C11FA3D5B157493C0A81782D85F418785F9 |quote=Minta Durfee, the actress who was married to Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle and became Charlie Chaplin's first motionpicture leading lady, died Tuesday in Woodland Hills, a Los Angeles suburb. |work=The New York Times |date=September 12, 1975 |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DelOlmo&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Del Olmo |title=Fatty Arbuckle's First Wife Dies |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/679361712.html?dids=679361712:679361712&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Sep+11%2C+1975&amp;author=FRANK+DEL+OLMO&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Fatty+Arbuckle%27s+First+Wife+Dies&amp;pqatl=google |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 12, 1975 |accessdate=July 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a strange couple, as Minta was short and petite while Arbuckle tipped the scales at 300 lbs.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; Arbuckle then joined the Morosco Burbank Stock vaudeville company and went on a tour of China and Japan returning in early 1909.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Long |first=Bruce |date=April 1995 |title=Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle |work=Taylorology |url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~ialong/Taylor28.txt |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbuckle began his film career with the [[Selig Polyscope Company]] in July 1909 when he appeared in ''[[Ben's Kid]]''. Arbuckle appeared sporadically in Selig one-reelers until 1913, moved briefly to [[Universal Pictures]] and became a star in producer-director [[Mack Sennett]]'s ''[[Keystone Cops]]'' comedies (However, according to the Motion Picture Studio Directory for 1919 and 1921, Arbuckle began his screen career with Keystone in 1913 as an extra for $3 a day (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3|1913|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), working his way up through the acting ranks to become a lead player and director.) Although his large size was undoubtedly part of his comedic appeal Arbuckle was self-conscious about his weight and refused to use it to get "cheap" laughs. For example, he would not allow himself to be stuck in a doorway or chair.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Arbuckle was a talented singer. After famed operatic tenor [[Enrico Caruso]] heard him sing, he urged the comedian to "...give up this nonsense you do for a living, with training you could become the second greatest singer in the world."&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;{{cite news |last=Nichols |first=Peter M. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E7DA1531F930A25757C0A9679C8B63 |title=HOME VIDEO; Arbuckle Shorts, Fresh and Frisky |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 2001 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his physical size, Arbuckle was remarkably agile and acrobatic. Director [[Mack Sennett]], when recounting his first meeting with Arbuckle, noted that he "skipped up the stairs as lightly as [[Fred Astaire]]"; and, "without warning went into a feather light step, clapped his hands and did a backward somersault as graceful as a girl tumbler". His comedies are noted as rollicking and fast-paced, have many chase scenes, and feature [[sight gag]]s. Arbuckle was fond of the "[[pieing|pie in the face]]", a comedy [[cliché]] that has come to symbolize silent-film-era comedy itself. The earliest known pie thrown in film was in the June 1913 Keystone one-reeler ''[[A Noise from the Deep]]'', starring Arbuckle and frequent screen partner [[Mabel Normand]].

In 1914, [[Paramount Pictures]] made the then-unheard-of offer of US$1,000-a-day plus 25% of all profits and complete artistic control to make movies with Arbuckle and Normand. The movies were so lucrative and popular that in 1918 they offered Arbuckle a three-year, $3&amp;nbsp;million contract (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000000|1918|r=-6}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosenberg |first=Jennifer |url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/famouscrimesscandals/a/fattyarbuckle.htm |title=Fatty Arbuckle Scandal |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fatty-Arbuckle-1921.jpg|frame|left|200px|Arbuckle's photo on the cover of the UK based ''Pictures'' motion picture magazine of the July 23, 1921 issue.]]
By 1916, Arbuckle was experiencing serious health problems. An infection that developed on his leg became a [[carbuncle]] so severe that doctors considered amputation. Although Arbuckle was able to keep his leg, he became addicted to the pain killer [[morphine]].

Following his recovery, Arbuckle started his own film company, Comique, in partnership with [[Joseph Schenck]]. Although Comique produced some of the best short pictures of the silent era, in 1918 Arbuckle transferred his controlling interest in the company to [[Buster Keaton]] and accepted Paramount's $3&amp;nbsp;million offer to make up to 18 feature films over three years.&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt;

Arbuckle disliked his screen nickname. "Fatty" had also been Arbuckle's nickname since school; "It was inevitable", he said. He weighed 185lb (13st 3lb, 84kg) when he was 12. Fans also called Roscoe "The Prince of Whales" and "The Balloonatic". However, the name ''Fatty'' identifies the character that Arbuckle portrayed on-screen (usually a naive hayseed)—not Arbuckle himself. When Arbuckle portrayed a female, the character was named "Miss Fatty", as in the film ''[[Miss Fatty's Seaside Lovers]]''. Arbuckle discouraged anyone from addressing him as "Fatty" off-screen, and when they did so his usual response was, "I've got a name, you know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=[[Alice Lake]] called him Arbie. To Mabel Normand he was Big Otto, after an elephant in the Selig Studio Zoo near Keystone. Buster Keaton called him Chief. [[Fred Mace]] called him Crab. And for some unexplained reason fellow comic [[Charles Murray (American actor)|Charlie Murray]] referred to him as My Child the Fat. His three wives always called him Roscoe |url=http://silent-movies.org/Arbucklemania/FACTS.html |title=Interesting facts about Roscoe Arbuckle |publisher=Arbucklemania |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandal==
{{Hollywood1921|right}}
On September 5, 1921, Arbuckle took a break from his hectic film schedule and, despite suffering from second-degree burns to both buttocks from an accident on set, drove to San Francisco with two friends, [[Lowell Sherman]] and [[Fred Fishback]]. The three checked into three rooms at the [[Westin St. Francis|St. Francis Hotel]]: 1219 for Arbuckle and Fishback to share, 1221 for Sherman, and 1220 designated as a party room.

Several women, including prostitutes,  were invited to the suite. During the carousing, a 26-year-old aspiring actress named [[Virginia Rappe]] was found seriously ill in room 1219 and was examined by the hotel doctor, who concluded her symptoms were mostly caused by intoxication, and gave her morphine to calm her. Rappe was not hospitalized until two days after the incident.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt;

[[File:Appartamento 1221 del st. francis hotel di s. francisco, 5 settembre 1921.jpg|thumb|280px|Suite 1221 of [[Westin St. Francis|St. Francis Hotel]] shortly after Arbuckle's party]]
Virginia Rappe suffered from chronic [[cystitis]],&lt;ref name=Lewiston&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7rEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KmkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4726,1981542&amp;dq=virginia+rappe&amp;hl=en |title=Testify Regarding Early Life of Virginia Rappe |date=October 31, 1921 |work=[[The Lewiston Daily Sun]] |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition that liquor irritated dramatically. Her heavy drinking habits and the poor quality of the era's [[bathtub gin|bootleg alcohol]] could leave her in severe physical distress. She developed a reputation for over-imbibing at parties, then drunkenly tearing at her clothes from the resulting physical pain. But by the time of the St. Francis Hotel party, her reproductive health was a greater concern. Despite reports trying to paint her in a bad light, the autopsy revealed she never had any abortion nor was pregnant. 

At the hospital, Rappe's companion at the party, Bambina Maude Delmont, who had met Rappe only a few days previously, told Rappe's doctor that Arbuckle had raped her "friend". Delmont was a woman of highly questionable character and had a lengthy police record for [[extortion]], [[blackmail]] and [[prostitution]]. The doctor examined Rappe but found no evidence of rape. Rappe died one day after her hospitalization from [[peritonitis]] caused by a [[ruptured bladder]]. Delmont then told police that Arbuckle had raped Rappe; the police concluded that the impact of Arbuckle's overweight body lying on top of Rappe had eventually caused her bladder to rupture.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt; At a later press conference, Rappe's manager, Al Semnacker, accused Arbuckle of using a jagged piece of ice to simulate sex with Rappe, thus leading to her injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SLgaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tUkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6297,1130214&amp;dq=sid+grauman&amp;hl=en |title=Miss Rappe's Manager Tells Worst He Knows of Arbuckle |last=Hopkins |first=Ernest J. |date=September 25, 1921 |work=[[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]] |page=3 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the story was reported in newspapers, the object had evolved into either a [[Coca-Cola]] or champagne bottle, rather than a piece of ice. In fact, witnesses testified that Arbuckle rubbed the ice on Rappe's stomach to ease her abdominal pain. Arbuckle denied any wrongdoing. Delmont later made a statement incriminating Arbuckle to the police in an attempt to extort money from Arbuckle's attorneys.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title='Fatty' Arbuckle and Hollywood's first scandal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14640719 |last=Sheerin |first=Jude |date=September 4, 2011 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbuckle's trial was a major media event. [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s nationwide newspaper chain exploited the situation with exaggerated and sensationalized stories. The story was fueled by [[yellow journalism]], with the newspapers portraying Arbuckle as a gross lecher who used his weight to overpower innocent girls. Hearst was gratified by the profits he accrued during the Arbuckle scandal, and later said that it had "sold more newspapers than any event since the sinking of the ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]].''"&lt;ref name="Hearst"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felix |first=Wanda |url=http://www.ralphmag.org/fatty.html |title=Fatty |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |journal=The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities |date=Fall 1995 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morality groups called for Arbuckle to be [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. The resulting scandal destroyed Arbuckle's career along with his personal life. 

Arbuckle was regarded by those who knew him closely as an amiable, good-natured and generous man who was shy around women; he had been described at the time as "the most chaste man in pictures".&lt;ref name="Ellis"/&gt; However, studio executives, fearing negative publicity by association, ordered Arbuckle's industry friends and fellow actors (whose careers they controlled) not to publicly speak up for him. [[Charlie Chaplin]], who was in Britain at the time, told reporters that he could not (and would not) believe Roscoe Arbuckle had anything to do with Virginia Rappe's death; having known Arbuckle since they both worked at Keystone in 1914, Chaplin "knew Roscoe to be a genial, easy-going type who would not harm a fly."&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, Charles: ''My Autobiography'', p. 270 (Simon and Schuster, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buster Keaton]] reportedly did make one public statement in support of Arbuckle's innocence, a decision which earned him a mild [[reprimand]] from the studio where he worked. Film actor [[William S. Hart]], who had never met or worked with Arbuckle, made a number of damaging public statements in which he presumed that Arbuckle was guilty. Arbuckle later wrote a premise for a film parodying Hart as a thief, bully, and wife beater, which Keaton purchased from him. The resulting film, ''[[The Frozen North]]'', was released in 1922, almost a year after the scandal first emerged. Keaton co-wrote, directed and starred in the picture; consequently, Hart refused to speak to Keaton for many years.&lt;ref name=Neibaur&gt;{{cite book |last=Neibaur |first=James |title=Buster Keaton's Silent Shorts: 1920–1923 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |isbn=978-0810887411 |pages=185–186 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Buster-Keatons-Silent-Shorts-1920-1923/dp/0810887401/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422654195&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Buster+Keaton%27s+Silent+Shorts%3A+1920-1923#reader_0810887401 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meade&gt;{{cite book |last=Meade |first=Marion |title=Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase |date=August 22, 1997 |publisher=DaCapo Press |location=Chapter 12 "Cops" |isbn=978-0306808029 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Buster-Keaton-Cut-The-Chase/dp/0306808021#reader_0306808021 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
The prosecutor, San Francisco District Attorney [[Matthew Brady (district attorney)|Matthew Brady]], an intensely ambitious man who planned to run for governor, made public pronouncements of Arbuckle's guilt and pressured witnesses to make false statements. Brady at first used Delmont as his star witness during the indictment hearing.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt; The defense had also obtained a letter from Delmont admitting to a plan to extort payment from Arbuckle. In view of Delmont's constantly changing story, her testimony would have ended any chance of going to trial. Ultimately, the judge found no evidence of rape. After hearing testimony from one of the party guests, Zey Prevon, that Rappe told her "Roscoe hurt me" on her deathbed, the judge decided that Arbuckle could be charged with [[first-degree murder]]. Brady had originally planned to seek the death penalty. The charge was later reduced to manslaughter.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt;

===First trial===
[[File:Roscoe Arbuckle Trial - 1921.jpg|thumb|Arbuckle and his defense lawyers at the first trial, November 1921]]
On September 17, 1921, Arbuckle was arrested and arraigned on the charges of manslaughter, but arranged bail after nearly three weeks in jail. The trial began November 14, 1921, in the city courthouse in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt; Arbuckle's defense lawyer was Gavin McNab, a professional and competent local attorney that Arbuckle hired as his lead defense counsel. The principal witness was Ms. Zey Prevon, a guest at the party.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mirror headlines, October 1, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the trial Arbuckle told his already-estranged wife, [[Minta Durfee]], that he did not harm Rappe; she believed him and appeared regularly in the courtroom to support him. Public feeling was so negative that she was later shot at while entering the courthouse.&lt;ref name="Hearst"/&gt;

Brady's first witnesses during the trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle with a smile on his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local [[criminology|criminologist]] who claimed that the fingerprints on the door to the hallway proved that Rappe had tried to flee, but that Arbuckle had stopped her by putting his hand over hers. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, however, Betty Campbell revealed that Brady had threatened to charge her with [[perjury]] if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had thoroughly cleaned the room before the investigation took place. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt; During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation, and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both direct and cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he testified that he had known for five or six years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time afterward Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of [[Billy Sunday]]) asked him for a ride into town, so he went to his room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle and a few of the guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. At this point all those present thought Rappe was just very drunk, including the hotel doctors. Probably assuming Rappe would simply sleep it off, Arbuckle drove Taub into town.

During the whole trial, the prosecution presented medical descriptions of Rappe's bladder as evidence that she had an illness. In his testimony, Arbuckle denied he had any knowledge of Rappe's illness. During cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Leo Friedman aggressively grilled Arbuckle over the fact that he refused to call a doctor when he found Rappe sick, and argued that he refused to do so because he knew of Rappe's illness and saw a perfect opportunity to rape and kill her. Arbuckle calmly maintained that he never physically hurt or sexually assaulted Rappe in any way during the September 5 party, and he also claimed that he never made any inappropriate sexual advances against any woman in his life. After over two weeks of testimony with 60 prosecution and defense witnesses, including 18 doctors who testified about Rappe's illness, the defense rested. On December 4, 1921, the jury returned five days later [[hung jury|deadlocked]] after nearly 44 hours of deliberation with a 10–2 not guilty verdict, and a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] was declared.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt;

Arbuckle's attorneys later concentrated their attention on one woman named Helen Hubbard who had told jurors that she would vote guilty "until hell freezes over". She refused to look at the exhibits or read the trial transcripts, having made up her mind in the courtroom. Hubbard's husband was a lawyer who did business with the D.A.'s office,&lt;ref name=Fine&gt;{{cite book |title=Difficult Reputations: Collective Memories of the Evil, Inept, and Controversial |date=April 1, 2001 |last=Fine |first=Gary Allen |page=151 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226249414}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expressed surprise that she was not challenged when selected for the jury pool. While much attention was paid to Hubbard after the trial, some former jury members told reporters that they believed that Arbuckle was indeed guilty, but not beyond a reasonable doubt. During the deliberations, some jurors joined Hubbard in voting to convict but nearly all of them recanted, except for – repeatedly at the end – Thomas Kilkenny (the only other juror who stuck to his 'guilty' vote). Arbuckle researcher Joan Myers describes the political climate and the media attention to the presence of women on juries (which had only been legal for four years at the time), and how Arbuckle's defense immediately singled out Hubbard as a villain; Myers also records Hubbard's account of the jury foreman August Fritze's attempts to bully her into changing her vote to 'not guilty'. While Hubbard offered explanations on her vote whenever challenged, Kilkenny remained silent and quickly faded from the media spotlight after the trial ended.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case of the Vanishing Juror |url=http://www.feminismthreepointzero.com/?page_id=33 |last=Myers |first=Joan |work=Feminism 3.0 |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second trial===
The second trial began on January 11, 1922, with a new jury, but with the same legal defense and prosecution team as well as the same presiding judge. The same evidence was presented, but this time one of the witnesses, Zey Prevon, testified that Brady had forced her to lie. Another witness who testified during the first trial, a former security guard named Jesse Norgard, who worked at [[Culver Studios]] where Arbuckle worked, testified that Arbuckle had once shown up at the studio and offered him cash  in exchange for the key to Rappe's dressing room. The comedian supposedly said he wanted it to play a joke on the actress. Norgard said he refused to give him the key. During cross-examination, Norgard's testimony was called into question when he was revealed to be an ex-convict who was currently charged with sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, and who was also looking for a sentence reduction from Brady in exchange for his testimony. Further, in contrast to the first trial, Rappe's history of promiscuity and heavy drinking was detailed. The second trial also discredited some major evidence such as the identification of Arbuckle's fingerprints on the hotel bedroom door: Heinrich retracted his  testimony from the first trial and now testified that the fingerprint evidence was likely fabricated. The defense was so confident of an acquittal, that Arbuckle was not called upon to testify. Arbuckle's lawyer, McNab, made no closing argument to the jury. However, some of the jurors interpreted the refusal of Arbuckle testimony as a sign of guilt. After five days and over 40 hours of deliberation, the jury returned on February 3, deadlocked with a 9–3 guilty verdict, resulting in a second mistrial.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt;

===Third trial===
By the time of the third trial, Arbuckle's films had been banned, and the newspapers had been filled for the past seven months with stories of alleged Hollywood orgies, murder, and sexual perversion. Bambina Maud Delmont was touring the country giving one-woman shows as "The woman who signed the murder charge against Arbuckle", and lecturing on the evils of Hollywood.
[[File:ArbuckleExonerated1922.jpg|thumb|150px|News story of the six-minute not guilty verdict, 1922.]]
The third trial began on March 13, 1922, and this time the defense took no chances. McNab took an aggressive defense, completely tearing apart the prosecution's case with long, careful and aggressive examination and cross-examination of each witness. McNab also managed to get in still more evidence about Virginia Rappe's lurid past and medical history. Another hole in the prosecution's case was opened because Zey Prevon, a key witness, fled the country after escaping from police custody and was unavailable to testify.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt; As in the first trial, Arbuckle testified as the final witness and again maintained his innocence in his heartfelt testimony about his version of the events at the party. During closing statements, McNab reviewed how flawed the prosecution's case was against Arbuckle, and how from the very start, District Attorney Brady fell for the outlandish charges of Bambina Maude Delmont, whom McNab described as "the complaining witness who never witnessed". On April 12, 1922, The jury began deliberations and took just six minutes to return with a unanimous verdict of not guilty—five of those minutes were spent writing a formal statement of apology to Arbuckle for putting him through the ordeal; an unusual and dramatic move in American justice. The jury statement as read by the foreman stated:

{{quotation|Acquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. We feel that a great injustice has been done him. We feel also that it was only our plain duty to give him this exoneration, under the evidence, for there was not the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the commission of a crime. He was manly throughout the case and told a straightforward story on the witness stand, which we all believed. The happening at the hotel was an unfortunate affair for which Arbuckle, so the evidence shows, was in no way responsible. We wish him success and hope that the American people will take the judgment of fourteen men and woman who have sat listening for thirty-one days to evidence, that Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from all blame.}}

After the reading of the apology statement, the jury foreman personally handed the statement to Arbuckle who kept it as a treasured memento for the rest of his life. Then, one by one, the entire 12-person jury plus the two jury alternates walked up to Arbuckle's defense table where they shook his hand and/or embraced and personally apologized to him. The entire jury even proudly posed in a photo op with Arbuckle for photographers after the verdict and apology.

Some experts later concluded that Rappe's bladder might also have ruptured as a result of an abortion she might have had a short time before the September 5th party. Rappe's organs had been destroyed after the autopsy, and it was now impossible to test for pregnancy. Because alcohol was consumed at the party, Arbuckle was forced to plead guilty to one count of violating the [[Volstead Act]], and was fined $500. At the time of his acquittal, Arbuckle owed over $700,000 (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|700000|1922|r=-5}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in legal fees to his attorneys for the three criminal trials, and he was forced to sell his house and all of his cars to pay some of the debt.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt;

The scandal and trials had destroyed Arbuckle's popularity among the general public, and in spite of the acquittal and the apology, his reputation was not restored, and the effects of the scandal continued. [[Will H. Hays]], who served as the head of the newly formed [[Motion Picture Association of America|Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors of America]] (MPPDA) Hollywood [[censorship|censor]] board, cited Arbuckle as an example of the poor morals prevalent in Hollywood. On April 18, 1922, six days after Arbuckle's acquittal, Hays banned  him from ever working in movies again. He had also requested that all future showings and bookings of Arbuckle films be canceled, and the exhibitors complied.

In December of the same year, under public pressure, Hays elected to lift the ban. However, Arbuckle was still unable to secure work as an actor.&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt; Most exhibitors still declined to show Arbuckle's films, several of which now have no copies known to have survived intact. One of Arbuckle's feature-length films known to survive is ''[[Leap Year (1921 film)|Leap Year]]'' (1924), which Paramount declined to release in the United States due to the scandal.{{sfn|Oderman|2005|page=199}} The movie was eventually released in Europe.&lt;ref name=Edmonds&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonds |first=Andy |title=Frame-Up!: The Untold Story of Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle |date=January 1991 |publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co. |isbn=978-0688091293 |page=302 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u29ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=leap+year |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1922, With Arbuckle's films now banned, Buster Keaton signed an agreement to give Arbuckle 35 percent of all future profits from his company, Buster Keaton Productions, to help ease his financial situation.&lt;ref name=Meade/&gt;

===Similar concurrent scandals===
Although it was regarded as Hollywood's first major scandal,&lt;ref name="trutv1"/&gt; the Arbuckle case was one of five major scandals of the period, all coincidentally connected to Paramount Pictures. In 1920, silent film actress [[Olive Thomas]] died after accidentally drinking [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercury bichloride]], which her husband, matinee idol [[Jack Pickford]], had been using as a topical treatment for syphilis; there were rumors that it had been a suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitfield |first=Eileen |title=Pickford: The Woman Who Made Hollywood |date=August 31, 2007 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0813191799 |page=224 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TygqXol9_h0C&amp;q=olive+thomas#v=snippet&amp;q=olive%20thomas&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1922, the murder of director [[William Desmond Taylor]] severely damaged the careers of actresses [[Mary Miles Minter]] and former Arbuckle screen partner [[Mabel Normand]].

==Aftermath==
In spite of his acquittal, Hollywood continued to shun Arbuckle, and he could no longer find work. A secondary effect, for archive history, was the determined destruction of copies of films starring Arbuckle.&lt;ref name=Humphreys&gt;{{cite book |title=Century of Scandal |last1=Humphreys |first1=Sally |last2=Humphreys |first2=Geraint |publisher=Haynes Publishing |date=February 1, 2011 |isbn=978-1-844259-50-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1923, Minta Durfee filed for divorce, charging grounds of desertion.&lt;ref name=time1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,716962,00.html |title=Milestones: November 12, 1923 |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 12, 1923 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divorce was granted the following January.&lt;ref name=time2&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,717388,00.html |title=Milestones: January 7, 1924 |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |work=Time |date=January 7, 1924 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been separated since 1921, though Durfee always claimed he was the nicest man in the world and they were still friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/mn/hp/minta1.html |title=Excerpts of Interview with Minta Durfee Arbuckle by Don Schneider and Stephen Normand |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |publisher=[[Owosso, Michigan#The Movie Museum|The Movie Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief reconciliation, Durfee again filed for divorce, this time while in Paris, in December 1924.&lt;ref name=time3&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,741918,00.html |title=Milestones: December 8, 1924 |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |work=Time |date=June 29, 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbuckle married Doris Deane on May 16, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donnelley |first=Paul |title=Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries |year=2003 |publisher=Music Sales Group |isbn=978-1849382465 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAhtNiAl3YsC&amp;q=arbuckle#v=snippet&amp;q=arbuckle&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbuckle again tried returning to filmmaking, but industry resistance to distributing his pictures continued to linger long after his acquittal. Frustrated, despondent and depressed, he retreated into alcoholism. In the words of his first wife, "Roscoe only seemed to find solace and comfort in a bottle". Buster Keaton attempted to help Arbuckle by giving him work on his films. Arbuckle wrote the story for a Keaton short called ''[[Daydreams (1922 film)|Daydreams]]'' (1922). Arbuckle allegedly co-directed scenes in Keaton's ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'' (1924), but it is unclear how much of this footage remained in the film's [[final cut (film editing)|final cut]]. In 1925, [[Carter Dehaven]] made the short ''Character Studies''. Arbuckle appeared alongside Buster Keaton, [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], and [[Jackie Coogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leider |first=Emily W. |title=Dark Lover: The Life and Death of Rudolph Valentino |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3qHDGpk5xwC&amp;q=arbuckle#v=snippet&amp;q=arbuckle&amp;f=false |page=198 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |location=New York |date=May 6, 2003 |isbn=978-0374282394 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, in ''[[Photoplay]]''{{'}}s August issue, [[James R.

==William Goodrich pseudonym==
Unable to work in films under his own name, Arbuckle eventually became a director using the alias '''William Goodrich'''. According to author [[David Yallop]] in ''The Day the Laughter Stopped'' (a biography of Arbuckle with special attention to the scandal and its aftermath), Arbuckle's father's full name was William Goodrich Arbuckle. Another tale credited friend Buster Keaton, an inveterate punster, with suggesting that Arbuckle become a director under the pseudonym "Will B. Good". The pun being a bit too obvious, Arbuckle adopted the more formal alias  "William Goodrich".{{sfn|Oderman|2005|page=201}} Keaton himself told this story during a recorded interview with film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buster Keaton Interviews|last=Sweeney|first=Kevin W.|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=2007|isbn=1578069637|location=Jackson|pages=192-193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1924 and 1932, Arbuckle directed a number of comedy shorts under the Goodrich pseudonym for [[Educational Pictures]], which featured lesser-known comics of the day. [[Louise Brooks]], who played the ingenue in ''[[Windy Riley Goes Hollywood]]'' (1931), also told Brownlow of her experiences in working with Arbuckle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He made no attempt to direct this picture. He just sat in his director's chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.&lt;ref name="Hearst"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the more visible directorial projects under the Goodrich pseudonym was the [[Eddie Cantor]] feature ''[[Special Delivery (1927 film)|Special Delivery]]'' (1927), which was released by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and co-starred [[William Powell]] and [[Jobyna Ralston]]. His highest-profile project was arguably ''[[The Red Mill (film)|The Red Mill]]'', also released in 1927, starring [[Marion Davies]].

==Second divorce and third marriage==
In 1929, Doris Deane sued for divorce in Los Angeles, charging desertion and cruelty.&lt;ref name=time4&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,737948,00.html |title=Milestones September 8, 1929 |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |quote=Sued for Divorce.

==Brief comeback and death==
In 1932, Arbuckle signed a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] to star under his own name in a series of six two-reel comedies, to be filmed at the [[Vitagraph]] studios in [[Brooklyn]]. These six short films constitute the only known recordings of his voice. Silent film comedian [[Al St. John]] (Arbuckle's nephew) and actors [[Shemp Howard]] and [[Lionel Stander]] appeared with Arbuckle. The films were very successful in America,&lt;ref name=oderman/&gt; although when Warner Bros. attempted to release the first one (''[[Hey, Pop!]]'') in the United Kingdom, the [[British Board of Film Classification|British Board of Film Censors]] cited the 10-year-old scandal and refused to grant an exhibition certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liebman |first=Roy |title=From Silents To Sound: A Biographical Encyclopedia Of Performers Who Made the Transition To Talking Pictures |year=1998 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0786403820 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWtZAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=arbuckle |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1933, Arbuckle had finished filming the last of the two-reelers (four of which had already been released). The next day he signed a contract with Warners to star in a feature-length film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9OVPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6814,663514&amp;dq=virginia+rappe&amp;hl=en |title=Arbuckle, Star Film Comedian, Dies in Sleep |date=July 1, 1933 |work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=January 30, 2015 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; That night he went out with friends to celebrate his first wedding anniversary and the new Warner contract when he reportedly said: "This is the best day of my life."

His widow Addie requested that his body be cremated as that was Arbuckle's wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crimes and Trials of the Century: From the Black Sox scandal to the Attica prison riots, Volume 1 |date=October 30, 2007 |publisher=Glenwood |isbn=978-0313341106 |page=69 |editor1-last=Chermak |editor1-first=Steven M. |editor2-last=Bailey |editor2-first=Frankie Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Many of Arbuckle's films, including the feature ''[[Life of the Party (1920 film)|Life of the Party]]'' (1920), survive only as worn prints with foreign-language inter-titles. Little or no effort was made to preserve original negatives and prints during Hollywood's first two decades. By the early 21st century, some of Arbuckle's short subjects (particularly those co-starring Chaplin or Keaton) had been restored, released on DVD, and even screened theatrically. Arbuckle's early influence on American slapstick comedy is widely recognised.&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eagan |first=Daniel |title=More on Fatty Arbuckle: His Films and His Legacy |url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/movies/2011/11/more-on-fatty-arbuckle-his-films-and-his-legacy/ |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]] film ''[[The Wild Party (1975 film)|The Wild Party]]'' (1975) has been repeatedly but incorrectly cited as a film dramatization of the Arbuckle–Rappe scandal. In fact it is loosely based on the 1926 poem by [[Joseph Moncure March]].&lt;ref name=Long&gt;{{cite book |last=Long |first=Robert Emmet |title=James Ivory in Conversation: How Merchant Ivory Makes Its Movies |date=December 11, 2006 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0520249998 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this film, [[James Coco]] portrays a heavy-set silent-film comedian named Jolly Grimm whose career is on the skids, but who is desperately planning a comeback. [[Raquel Welch]] portrays his mistress, who ultimately goads him into shooting her. This film bears some similarities to the misconceptions surrounding the Arbuckle scandal, yet it contains nothing resembling the documented facts of the case.&lt;ref name=Mayo&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayo |first=Mike |title=American Murder: Criminals, Crimes and the Media |date=February 1, 2008 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |isbn=978-1578591916 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EEoU2kOb0OIC&amp;q=arbuckle#v=snippet&amp;q=arbuckle&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ken Russell]]'s 1977 biopic ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'', [[Rudolph Nureyev]] as a pre-movie star [[Rudolph Valentino]] dances in a nightclub before a grossly overweight, obnoxious, and hedonistic celebrity called "Mr. Fatty" (played by [[William Hootkins]]), a caricature of Arbuckle rooted in the public view of him created in popular press coverage of the Rappe rape trial. In the scene, Valentino picks up starlet [[Jean Acker]] (played by [[Carol Kane]]) off a table in which she is sitting in front of Fatty and dances with her, enraging the spoiled star, who becomes apoplectic.&lt;ref name="Valentino 1977"&gt;{{cite web |title=Valentino. 1977. Rudolph Nureyev Dances |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnLXaeHk6gM |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caricature of Arbuckle as a lecherous boor continued to be promulgated in the 1970s by some film writers such as [[Kenneth Anger]] in his controversial book ''[[Hollywood Babylon]]''.

In an episode of the ''[[Mathnet]]'' segment of the children's public-television television series ''[[Square One Television]]'' (Season 2, Episode 1, "The Case of the Willing Parrot," presented in five sections over the course of a week of the overall show), fictitious deceased celebrity Roscoe "Fatty" Tissue was written as a parody of Arbuckle.

Before his untimely death in 1997, popular comedian [[Chris Farley]] expressed interest in starring as Arbuckle in a film biography. According to the 2008 biography ''The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts'', Farley and screenwriter [[David Mamet]] agreed to work together on what would have been Farley's first dramatic role.&lt;ref name=Farley&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farley |first1=Tom |last2=Colby |first2=Tanner |title=The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts |date=May 6, 2008 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-1616804589 |page=262 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVgSPlmvkt4C&amp;q=arbuckle#v=onepage&amp;q=arbuckle%20mamet&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, director [[Kevin Connor (director)|Kevin Connor]] planned a film, ''The Life of the Party'', based on Arbuckle's life. It was to star [[Chris Kattan]] and [[Preston Lacy]].&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=Susan |title=Screening Room |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/15/entertainment/gd-moviesscreen15 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the project was shelved.&lt;ref name=Schanie&gt;{{cite book |last=Schanie |first=Andrew |title=Movie Confidential: Sex, Scandal, Murder and Mayhem in the Film Industry |url=https://www.amazon.com/Movie-Confidential-Scandal-Murder-Industry-ebook/dp/B004V3THVK/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422671563&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Movie+Confidential%3A+Sex%2C+Scandal%2C+Murder+and+Mayhem+in+the+Film+Industry.#reader_B004V3THVK |year=2010 |publisher=Clerisy Press |isbn=978-1578603541 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Farley, comedians [[John Belushi]] and [[John Candy]] had also earlier considered playing Arbuckle, but  both died before a biopic could be made. Farley's film was signed with Vince Vaughn as his co-star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bovsun|first=Mara|title=Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, acquitted for murder of Virginia Rappe in 1922, never recovered from all the bad press|date=September 1, 2012|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/roscoe-fatty-arbuckle-acquitted-murder-virginia-rappe-1922-recovered-bad-press-article-1.1149824|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, jazz trumpet player [[Dave Douglas (trumpeter)|Dave Douglas]] released the album "Keystone", dedicated to the work of Roscoe Arbuckle. It contains a DVD which features the movie ''[[Fatty and Mabel Adrift]]'' (1916/ Keystone – Triangle), starring Roscoe Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, [[Al St. John]], and Luke the Dog.

In April and May 2006, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City mounted a 56-film, month-long retrospective of all of Arbuckle's known surviving work, running the entire series twice.&lt;ref name=Moma&gt;{{cite web |title=Rediscovering Roscoe: The Careers of "Fatty" Arbuckle |url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/films/910 |publisher=moma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbuckle is the subject of a 2004 novel titled ''[[I, Fatty]]'' by author [[Jerry Stahl]]. ''The Day the Laughter Stopped'' by David Yallop and ''Frame-Up! The Untold Story of Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle'' by Andy Edmonds are other books on Arbuckle's life.&lt;ref name=Paulus&gt;{{cite book |title=Slapstick Comedy |date=April 21, 2010 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Slapstick-Comedy-AFI-Film-Readers/dp/0415801796/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422672334&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=slapstick+comedy#reader_0415801796 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415801799 |page=86 |editor1-last=Paulus |editor1-first=Tom |editor2-last=King |editor2-first=Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1963 novel, ''Scandal in Eden'' by Garet Rogers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=Garet |title=Scandal in Eden |publisher=Dial Press |date=1963| url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/garet-rogers-3/gandal-in-eden/ |accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictionalized version of the Arbuckle scandal.

[[Fatty Arbuckle's]] was an American-themed restaurant chain in the UK prominent during the 1980s and named after Arbuckle.

''Stoneface'', a 2012 play by [[Vanessa Claire Stewart]] about [[Buster Keaton]], depicts Keaton's and Arbuckle's friendship and professional relationship.

Arbuckle is played by actor [[Brett Ashy]] in the motion picture ''[[Return to Babylon]]'' (2013).

The scandal is described during the climax of the film [[Middle Man (film)|''Middle Man'']].

'''Show, don't tell''' is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through [[Action (fiction)|action]], words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], summarization, and [[description]]. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to [[nonfiction]] and all forms of [[fiction]], literature including [[Haiku]]&lt;ref&gt;British Haiku Society- occasional paper 'English Haiku: a Composite View'2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imagism]] poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wells | year = 1999 | title = How To Write Non-Fiction Books | publisher = Writers' Bookshop | page = 65 | isbn= 1902713028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Warren | year = 2011 | title = Show Don't Tell: A Guide to Purpose Driven Speech | publisher = Jerianne Warren | isbn= 0615498353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mackendrick, Cronin, Scorsese | year = 2005 | title = On Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director | publisher = Faber \&amp; Faber | page = xxiii | isbn= 0571211259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hatcher | year = 2000 | title = The Art and Craft of Playwriting | publisher = F+W Media | page = 43 | isbn= 1884910467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright [[Anton Chekhov]], reputed to have said "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yarmolinsky|first=Avrahm|year=1954|title=The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings Hitherto Untranslated by Anton Chekhov|page=14|publisher=Noonday Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between telling and showing was popularized in [[Percy Lubbock]]'s book ''The Craft of Fiction'' (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon [[narratology|narratological theory]] ever since.

==Examples==
===Ernest Hemingway===

Nobel Prize–winning novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] was a notable proponent of the "show, don't tell" style. His [[Iceberg Theory]], also known as the "theory of omission", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0v1GUke_ncMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=If+a+writer+of+prose+knows+enough+of+what+he+is+writing+about+he+may+omit+things+that+he+knows+and+the+reader,+if+the+writer+is+writing+truly+enough,+will+have+a+feeling+of+those+things+as+strongly+as+though+the+writer+had+stated+them.+The+dignity+of+movement+of+an+iceberg+is+due+to+only+one-eighth+of+it+being+above+water.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Pywc3XAhVEJFAKHaiMAW8QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hemingway's Theaters of Masculinity|first=Thomas F.|last=Strychacz|date=20 November 2017|publisher=LSU Press|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Creative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, [[metaphor]], understatement, the [[unreliable narrator]], and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izK6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=develop+a+feeling+for+the+meaning+behind+the+action,+without+having+the+point+painfully+laid+out+for+them&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=82FuRr_SB2&amp;sig=Ucrfj3FnKus-LfTEeIL0VllGDBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy2qmsw83XAhVFJ1AKHbJvD9sQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=How to Write a Novel in 90 Days|first=Conrad|last=Jones|date=21 October 2013|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chuck Palahniuk===

In a 2013 article, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] (author of the novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'') goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls "thought verbs" ("Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]") favoring instead the use of "specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palahniuk|first=Chuck|title=Nuts and Bolts: "Thought" Verbs|url=http://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs|work=LitReactor|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Scott Bell===

"Show, don't tell" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, "Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or [[scene (fiction)|scene]]. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Orson Scott Card===

[[Scene (drama)|Scenes]] that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress.

[[File:Nepali Woman Smiles.jpg|thumb|A [[People of Nepal|Nepali]] Newar woman smiling]]

A '''smile''' is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the [[muscle]]s at the sides of the [[Human mouth|mouth]]. It is believed it takes about 42 muscles to smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freitas-Magalhães |first=A. |last2= Castro|first2= E.=|title=Facial Expression: The Brain and The Face |pages=1–18 |location=Porto |publisher=University Fernando Pessoa Press |isbn=978-989-643-034-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the [[human eye|eyes]], an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.

Among [[human]]s, smiling is an expression denoting [[pleasure]], [[socializing|sociability]], [[happiness]], [[joy]] or [[amusement]]. It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of [[anxiety]] known as a [[wikt:Special:Search/grimace|grimace]]. Although cross-cultural studies have shown that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carroll E. |last=Izard |year=1971 |title=The Face of Emotion |location=New York |publisher=Appleton-Century-Croft |isbn=0-390-47831-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are large differences among different cultures, with some using smiles to convey confusion or embarrassment.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Girl Portrait Kid Cute Hair Sunlight Arab Young.jpg|thumb|left|220xp|An [[Arabs|Arab]] girl smiling]]
Primatologist Signe Preuschoft traces the smile back over 30 million years of evolution to a "fear grin" stemming from monkeys and apes who often used barely clenched teeth to portray to predators that they were harmless, or to signal submission to more dominant group members. The smile may have evolved differently among species and especially among humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/why-do-we-smile-and-laugh-when-were-terrified-1441046376|title=Why do we smile and laugh when we're terrified?|last=Inglis-Arkell|first=Esther|date=7 October 2013|website=io9.com|publisher=io9.com|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Biology as an academic discipline that interprets the smile, those who study [[kinesics]] and [[psychology]] such as [[Freitas-Magalhaes]] view the smile as an [[affect display]] that can communicate feelings such as love, happiness, glee, pride, contempt, and embarrassment. Also, other types of primates can express this gesture as a symbol of happiness and fun.

== Social effects ==
A smile seems to have a favorable [[Social influence|influence]] upon others and makes one likable and more approachable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gladstone |first=G. |title=When you’re smiling, does the whole world smile for you? |journal=Australasian Psychiatry |year=2002 |volume=10 |issue= |pages=144–146 |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1665.2002.00423.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the social context, smiling and [[laughter]] have different functions in the order of sequence in social situations:
* Smiling is sometimes a pre-laughing device and is a common pattern for paving the way to laughter;
* Smiling can be used as a response to laughter in the previous turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haakana |first=M. |title=Laughter and smiling:  Notes on co-occurrences |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |year=2010 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=1499–1512 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.01.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smiling is a signaling system that evolved from a need to communicate information of many different forms. One of these is advertisement of sexual interest. Female smiles are appealing to heterosexual males, increasing physical attractiveness and enhancing [[sex appeal]]. However, recent research indicates a man's smile may or may not be most effective in attracting heterosexual women, and that facial expressions such as pride or even shame might be more effective.  The researchers ignored the role of smiles in other sexual preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jessica L. |last=Tracy |first2=Alec T. |last2=Beall |title=Happy Guys Finish Last: The Impact of Emotion Expressions on Sexual Attraction |journal=[[Emotion (journal)|Emotion]] |volume=11 |issue=6 |year=2011 |pages=1379–1387 |url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Happy-Guys...in-pres-Emotion.pdf |doi=10.1037/a0022902 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626032707/http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Happy-Guys...in-pres-Emotion.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As reinforcement and manipulation ===
The influence of smiling on others is not necessarily benign. It may take the form of [[positive reinforcement]], possibly for an underhand [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and [[abusive]] purpose.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[superficial smile]].

== Cultural differences ==
[[File:Eating rice, China - collected by Berthold Laufer.jpg|thumb|In the 19th century and early 20th century, photographs didn't often depict smiling people in accordance to cultural conventions of Victorian and Edwardian culture. In contrast, the photograph ''Eating Rice, China'' reflects differing cultural attitudes of the time, depicting a smiling Chinese man. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Phil|title=Why people never smiled in old photographs|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/8/8365997/smile-old-photographs|website=Vox|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While smiling is perceived as a positive emotion most of the time, there are many [[cultures]] that perceive smiling as a negative expression and consider it unwelcoming. Too much smiling can be viewed as a sign of shallowness or [[dishonesty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Tidwell |url=http://www.andrews.edu/~tidwell/bsad560/NonVerbal.html |title=Non Verbal Communication |publisher=Andrews.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of [[Asia]], people may smile when they are embarrassed or in emotional pain. Some people may smile at others to indicate a friendly greeting. A smile may be reserved for close friends and family members. Many people in the [[former Soviet Union]] area consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/advising/american_culture/social_skills/nonverbal_communication/reading_exercise.htm |title=Nonverbal Communication |publisher=Rpi.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dimples ==
[[File:VirgilGriffithFace.jpg|thumb|A man with cheek [[dimples]] smiling.]]
[[Dimple|Cheek dimples]] are visible indentations of the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], caused by underlying flesh, which form on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Dimples are genetically inherited and are a dominant trait. A rarer form is the single dimple, which occurs on one side of the face only. Anatomically, dimples may be caused by variations in the structure of the facial muscle known as [[zygomaticus major muscle|zygomaticus major]]. Specifically, the presence of a double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle may explain the formation of cheek dimples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pessa |first=Joel E. |title=Double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle: Anatomy, incidence, and clinical correlation |year=1998 |journal=Clinical Anatomy |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=310–313 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2353(1998)11:5&lt;310::AID-CA3&gt;3.0.CO;2-T |pmid=9725574|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This bifid variation of the muscle originates as a single structure from the [[zygomatic bone]]. As it travels anteriorly, it then divides with a superior bundle that inserts in the typical position above the corner of the mouth. An inferior bundle inserts below the corner of the mouth.

== Duchenne smile ==
[[File:Smiling girl.jpg|thumb|A Duchenne smile engages the muscles around the mouth and eyes.]]

While conducting research on the [[physiology]] of facial expressions in the mid-19th century, French neurologist  [[Guillaume Duchenne]] identified two distinct types of smiles. A Duchenne smile involves contraction of both the [[zygomaticus major muscle|zygomatic major muscle]] (which raises the corners of the mouth) and the [[orbicularis oculi muscle]] (which raises the cheeks and forms [[wrinkle (skin)|crow's feet]] around the eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drewnicky|first=Alex|title=Body Language - Common Myths and How to use it effectively|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/303r1clvpjwghja/Body-Language.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duchenne smile has been described as "smizing", as in "smiling with the eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Darryl|title=How to Design a Life Worth Smiling About: Developing Success in Business and in Life|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071819879|page=8|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DHbhAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An exaggerated Duchenne smile is associated with lying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweek.co.uk/93854/how-facial-software-can-identify-liars How facial software can identify liars May 25, 2018]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-Duchenne smile involves only the zygomatic major muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Duchenne, Guillaume (1990). ''The Mechanism of Human Facial Expression''. New York: Cambridge University Press. Translated by R. Andrew . Originally published as ''Mecanisme de la Physionomie Humaine'' in 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; "Research with adults initially indicated that joy was indexed by generic smiling, any smiling involving the raising of the lip corners by the zygomatic major [...]. More recent research suggests that smiling in which the muscle around the eye contracts, raising the cheeks high (Duchenne smiling), is uniquely associated with positive emotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Messinger |first=D. S. |last2=Fogel |first2=A. |last3=Dickson |first3=K. |year=2001 |title=All smiles are positive, but some smiles are more positive than others |journal=[[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=642–653 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.37.5.642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pan Am smile, also known as the "[[Botox]] smile", is the name given to a fake smile, in which only the [[zygomatic major muscle]] is voluntarily contracted to show politeness. It is named after the now defunct airline [[Pan American World Airways]], whose flight attendants would always flash every passenger the same perfunctory smile.&lt;ref name="panam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harlow|first=John|title=The smile that says where you’re from|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article516707.ece|accessdate=18 January 2011|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=February 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Botox was introduced for cosmetic use in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fischer|first=Andrea|title=FDA approves Botox Cosmetic to improve the appearance of crow’s feet lines|url=http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm367662.htm|accessdate=3 November 2013|date=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic use of Botox injections to deal with eye wrinkle can result in the paralysis of the small muscles around the eyes, preventing the appearance of a Duchenne smile.

== In animals ==

In animals, the baring of teeth is often used as a [[threat display|threat or warning display]]—known as a [[snarl]]—or a sign of [[submission]]. For [[chimpanzees]], it can also be a sign of [[fear]]. However, not all animal displays of teeth convey negative acts or emotions. For example, [[Barbary macaque]]s demonstrate an open mouth display as a sign of playfulness, which likely has similar roots and purposes as the human smile.&lt;ref name="smile"&gt;Preuschoft, Signe. "'Laughter' and 'Smile' in Barbary Macaques (''Macaca Sylvanus'')". Ethology 91.3 (1992): 220-36. {{doi|10.1111/j.1439-0310.1992.tb00864.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

On November 12, 2013, Snapshot Games was founded as a [[Privately held company|privately held corporation]] in the state of [[California]] of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?SearchType=CORP&amp;SearchCriteria=snapshot+games&amp;SearchSubType=Keyword|title=Business Search - Business Entities - Business Programs {{!}} California Secretary of State|website=businesssearch.sos.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is based in [[Bulgaria]] where its [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Julian Gollop]], lives and where video game development costs are about one-third of what they would be for a similar [[Independent video game developer|studio]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phoenix Point's Fig campaign promises new take on classic X-COM formula" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In April 2014, Snapshot Games launched a [[Kickstarter]] to [[crowdfund]] the development of its first [[video game]], ''[[Chaos Reborn]]''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1206403106/chaos-reborn-from-the-creator-of-the-original-x-co/|title=Chaos Reborn - From the Creator of the Original X-COM|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was successful, generating over $210,000.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The game was made available through the [[Early Access]] program of [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on December 9, 2014 before it was released officially on October 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/09/chaos-reborn-release-date-2/|title=X-COM Creator’s Chaos Reborn Is Born This Month|last=Meer|first=Alec|date=2015-10-09|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received a score of 86/100 on review aggregation website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/chaos-reborn|title=Chaos Reborn|website=Metacritic|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' awarded it a score of 87%, saying "A true wizard’s wheeze, and a fine return for one of gaming’s oldest tactical classics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/chaos-reborn-review/|title=Chaos Reborn review|work=[[PC Gamer]]|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also was nominated for a [[Golden Joystick Award]] in the 2015 Best Indie Game category but lost to ''[[Kerbal Space Program]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://geeksyndicate.co.uk/news/the-golden-joystick-awards-2015-voting-now-open/|title=The Golden Joystick Awards 2015 - Voting Now Open - Geek Syndicate|date=2015-09-04|work=Geek Syndicate|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34679591/golden-joysticks-2015-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-wins-five-gaming-awards|title=Golden Joysticks 2015: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt wins five gaming awards - BBC Newsbeat|date=2015-10-30|website=BBC Newsbeat|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swiss Vapeur Parc''' is a [[miniature park]] in [[Le Bouveret]], a village on [[Lac Léman]], [[Switzerland]]. It was opened on June 6, 1989, by an International Festival of Steam (therefore steam trains). When the park opened its total surface area was 9000 m² (2.2 acres), but the park expanded and as of 2007, the park covers a surface area of 17'000 m² (or 4.2 acres). In 1989, the park possessed only 2 locomotives (one running on benzine and one on steam). As of 2007, the number of trains running on benzine has sextupled while the number of steam trains has increased to 9 trains. By March 31, 2007, the Park has had 2'126'000 visitors.

Every June the park is host to the International Steam Festival.

'''''The Heights''''' is an American musical drama series that aired Thursday at 9:00 pm on the [[Fox network]] from August to November 1992.

==Synopsis==
''The Heights'' centers on a fictional band (also called The Heights) made up of mostly working-class young adults. Episodes regularly featured one of their songs.

The eventual theme song for the show, "[[How Do You Talk to an Angel]]" (sung by cast member [[Jamie Walters]]), went to number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and was the first song from a television show to top the Hot 100 since 1985, as well as the first song by a fictional band to top the Hot 100 since 1969. ''The Heights'' premiered on August 27, 1992, to low ratings, and never gained a substantial audience. Fox canceled the series less than a week after the theme song fell from the number one spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred |title=The Billboard Book Of Number 1 Hits|publisher=Billboard Books|year=2003|edition=5|pages=812|isbn=0-8230-7677-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mongoliad''''' is a fictional narrative set in the ''Foreworld Saga'', a [[secret history]] transmedia franchise developed by the Subutai Corporation.&lt;ref name=cnet/&gt; ''The Mongoliad'' was originally released in a serialized format online, and via a series of [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps, but was restructured and re-edited for a definitive edition released via the [[Amazon Publishing]] imprint [[47North]], both in print and in [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] format. Fan-submitted Foreworld stories are published via Amazon's [[Kindle Worlds]] imprint.

==Collaborators and format==
The serialized edition was intended to be distributed primarily as a series of applications ("apps") for [[smartphones]], which the Subutai Corporation viewed as a new model for publishing storytelling.&lt;ref name=io9/&gt; At the project's core is a narrative of adventure fiction following the exploits of a small group of fighters and mystics in medieval Europe around the time of the [[Mongol conquests]]. As well as speculative fiction authors [[Neal Stephenson]] (chairman of Subutai), [[Greg Bear]], [[Nicole Galland]], [[Mark Teppo]] and others, collaborators include filmmakers, computer programmers, graphic artists, martial artists and combat choreographers, video game designers, and a professional editor.&lt;ref name=fast/&gt; In a departure from conventional fiction, much of the content of ''The Mongoliad'' was in forms other than text, not bound to any single medium and not in the service of the central narrative. Once the project developed momentum, the Subutai Corporation envisioned fans of the work contributing, expanding and enriching the narrative, and the fictional universe in which it takes place.&lt;ref name=io9/&gt;

According to Jeremy Bornstein, president of the Subutai Corporation, the genesis of the project was in Stephenson's dissatisfaction with the authenticity of the early modern swordfighting scenes he had written into his series ''[[The Baroque Cycle]]''.&lt;ref name=cnet/&gt; Stephenson gathered a group of martial arts enthusiasts interested in studying historical European swordfighting, and this eventually resulted in some of the members of this group collaborating on a set of stories that would make use of accurate representations of these martial arts.&lt;ref name=vimeo/&gt;&lt;ref name=newitz/&gt;
The collaborators decided that the project need not limit itself to the traditional novel form and began developing ideas on how to produce it in different media while retaining the caliber that would be expected of a new work by authors such as Stephenson or Bear.&lt;ref name=cnet/&gt;

An "[[alpha version]]" was demonstrated at the periodic application showcase SF App Show in [[San Francisco, California]] on May 25, 2010.&lt;ref name=cnet/&gt;&lt;ref name=io9/&gt;

The serialized project ran from September 1, 2010 until January 25, 2012. New chapters, as well as supplemental materials, were released on a semi-regular schedule. The iOS apps were available in the Apple App Store, and the Android app was available in the Android Store.&lt;ref name=io9/&gt; The print edition was published on April 24, 2012.  The mongoliad.com website was subsequently closed.&lt;ref name='closing'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foreworld.com/mongoliad/ | title = On the closing of mongoliad.com | accessdate = 2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject of the published ''Mongoliad'' books==
The serial novels and their related, shorter "SideQuests" are set in the authors' "Foreworld" universe, which they describe as "almost like the world we live in," during the mid-thirteenth century [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], under leadership of [[Genghis Khan]] and his successor [[Ögedei Khan]]. The story includes descriptions of Ögedei Khan's court (notably, his rolling [[Orda (organization)#Etymology|"ordo" tent]]); the geography, flora and fauna of the great [[Eurasian Steppe]]; and especially [[Historical European martial arts#Early history .28before 1350.29|medieval European]] and Asian  martial arts. A parallel plot line takes place in Rome, and includes highly detailed depictions of a [[Papal conclave#Conclaves|papal conclave]].

==Historical events and persons depicted in the ''Mongoliad'' series==
The novels incorporate historical events in Poland, Rome, Russia and central Asia that ran concurrently with the last major events of the Mongol invasion. The authors construct a fictional narrative that connects all these events of the year 1241, describing some earlier historical events and adding other entirely fictional events and characters. Some medieval mythology is also included in the later books, especially the [[Holy Grail]] and elements of [[Norse mythology]]. 

Mongol events and persons described in the books include Ögedei's recollection of the 1201 battle of [[Khalakhaljid Sands]], which cemented Ghengis' leadership of the clans, and the 1229 death of his brother [[Tolui]], described in [[The Secret History of the Mongols]] as a heroic sacrifice to save Ögedei's life. Later, the 1241 death of Ögedei Khan (cause unknown) and the resulting recall of all the Khans to select a new "Khan of Khans" is woven into the fictional narrative.

The [[Siege of Kiev (1240)]] and other events in the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]] and Europe are described in 1241 by a survivor, as a group of the novel's fictional characters pass through the ruined city. The [[Battle of Mohi]] (Hungary) and the [[Battle of Legnica]] (Poland) are also described by fictional "survivors". Several religious orders of knights formed during the Crusades (and their leaders), including the [[Teutonic Order]], [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] are involved in the narrative.  

Historical events and persons in 1241 Rome include the [[Papal election, 1241|papal conclave that selected Cardinal Castiglione]] to become [[Pope Celestine IV]]. Cardinal Fieschi (later [[Pope Innocent IV]]), and other future Popes are also members of the conclave. Senator [[Matteo Rosso Orsini]] and Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] also appear as fictionalized characters.

[[Alexander Nevsky]]'s 1242 campaign against German and Estonian invaders is a major subject of Book 4, including the climactic [[Battle on the Ice]]. The mythical [[Baba Yaga]] helps the protagonists defend [[Kievan Rus']]. In Book 5, the action shifts to the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against [[Catharism]], and the 1244 siege of [[Château de Montségur]].

The '''Vettweiss-Froitzheim Dice Tower''' is a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] artifact, a [[dice tower]] formerly used in the playing of [[dice]] games.&lt;ref name="RLB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rlmb.lvr.de/museum/meisterwerke/e0edb7e6-0f82-441f-bef0-80a4a4a32bdb.htm|title=A description of the tower at the Rheinisches Landesmuseum of Bonn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to produce a trustworthy throw of one or more dice. It was discovered in 1985 in Germany. It is preserved in the [[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn|Rheinisches Landesmuseum]] of [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name="RLB"/&gt;

The tower dates to the fourth century AD and was apparently presented as a gift. It bears two [[Latin]] texts. The longer text commemorates a military defeat of the [[Picts]]. The shorter text wishes good luck to the unnamed recipients of the item.&lt;ref name="RLB"/&gt;

==Discovery==

The [[dice tower]] was discovered in 1985 near the modern villages of [[Vettweiß|Vettweiss and Froitzheim]]. During the Roman era this location was in the province of [[Germania Inferior]] on the [[Rhine|Imperial frontier]] with [[Germanic peoples|Germania]]. This was the site of a [[Roman villa|villa]] in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The major military centre of [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium|Cologne]] was located nearby.

==Description==
It is an upright, hollow cuboid of copper-alloy plate designed to sit level on a flat surface. The top of the dice tower is open, allowing for the introduction of dice, and it contains three levels of projecting baffles which would produce random motion in the dice as they fell through the tower.&lt;ref name="RLB"/&gt;
The dice would then emerge at the base of the tower via a miniature flight of steps. The dice, while emerging, would ring three bells which formerly hung above the exit. One of these bells survives intact.&lt;ref name="RLB"/&gt;

The tower is decorated on all faces with pierced patterns and two short Latin texts are displayed prominently.&lt;ref name="RLB"/&gt;

The front face of the tower bears the words,

:PICTOS VICTOS
:HOSTIS DELETA
:LVDITE SECVRI

Which may be translated as,

:The Picts are defeated.
:The enemy is destroyed.
:Play in safety!

Around the top of the three remaining faces is the phrase,

:UTERE FELIX VIVAS

Which may be translated as,

:Use it and live luckily/happily.&lt;ref name="RLB"/&gt;
